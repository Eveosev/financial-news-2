Indiana University  sits atop the
Associated Press Top 25 for the fourth straight week, while a
pair of smaller schools with ties to two Hall of Fame National
Basketball Association teammates made historic jumps.  Gonzaga University , alma mater of former Utah Jazz guard
John Stockton, is No. 2 for the first time in school history.
 Louisiana Tech University  is ranked No. 25 this week, its first
time in the poll since the 1984-85 season, when it was led by
 Karl Malone .  Malone and Stockton played together in Utah for 18 NBA
seasons, leading the Jazz to the playoffs every year, and won
gold medals with the U.S. teams at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.
Both were inducted into the  Basketball Hall of Fame  on their
first ballot.  Indiana (24-3), which has been the top-ranked college
basketball team for 10 weeks this season, beat then-No. 4
 Michigan  State on Feb. 19. The Hoosiers received all but one of
the 65 votes from a national panel of media members.  Gonzaga (27-2) received the other first-place vote. The
Bulldogs have won 10 consecutive games dating back to Jan. 19
and are a perfect 14-0 in West Coast Conference play.  Duke (24-3), Michigan (23-4) and Miami (22-4) round out the
Top 5. Kansas (23-4) is sixth, followed by Georgetown (21-4),
 Florida  (22-4), Michigan State (22-6) and Louisville (22-5).  To contact the reporter on this story:
