The grounding of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787
Dreamliners is causing a “huge problem” for some airlines, the
 International Air Transport Association ’s Chief Executive
Officer Tony Tyler said.  Grounding is a “huge problem for the airlines that have
already taken deliveries of those aircraft, and others who are
awaiting delivery,” Tyler said on Bloomberg Television’s “On
the Move” with  Rishaad Salamat  today. “Yes, big problem.”  Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners have been grounded since Jan. 16
following two incidents in which lithium-ion batteries smoldered
and emitted smoke. The Chicago-based planemaker awaits a
response from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration after
submitting its plan to fix the jet’s batteries.  The FAA grounded the Dreamliner following a Jan. 7 fire on
a  Japan  Airlines Co. 787 parked in  Boston  and a battery fault
that triggered an emergency landing in Japan by an All Nippon
Airways Co. plane.  ANA plans to cancel 1,250 domestic 787 flights and 464
international 787 flights from March 31 to May 31, the company
said in a statement today. A total of 3,601 Dreamliner flights
will be canceled from Jan. 16 to May 31, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
