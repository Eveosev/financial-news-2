Belgium’s La Poste SA, the postal
service company known as Belgian Post and owned by CVC Capital
Partners Ltd., is reviving an initial public offering that could
raise about 500 million pounds ($755 million), said two people
familiar with the matter.  CVC is working with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) , the people said. It called earlier this month for
additional banks to pitch for roles on the IPO, the people said,
asking not to be named as the plans aren’t public. The share
sale may happen as soon as the second quarter, they said.  CVC, which manages funds for over 300 investors, is trying
to go public with stakes in companies including German chemicals
business Evonik Industries AG and Indonesia’s PT Matahari
Department Store Tbk as it attempts to raise more funds this
year. CVC is seeking about $3 billion in its fourth Asia fund, a
person with knowledge of the matter said.  A spokesman for Belgian Post declined to comment. A
representative of CVC wasn’t immediately available for comment.  The British fund bought a stake in Belgian Post in January
2006, according to its  website . The company has revenue of 2.4
billion euros, the webisite said. At the end of 2009, it had
close to 30,000 employees.  IFR reported the news of CVC’s request for more banks to
pitch for roles earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
