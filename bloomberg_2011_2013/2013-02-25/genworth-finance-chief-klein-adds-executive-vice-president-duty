Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the seller
of life insurance and mortgage guaranties, said Chief Financial
Officer Martin Klein will take on new duties overseeing units the
company has targeted for possible sale.  Klein, 53, was given the additional title of executive vice
president and will have operational responsibilities for
international protection and wealth-management segments, the
Richmond, Virginia-based insurer said today in a statement.  Genworth may sell those businesses as it seeks to boost
value for shareholders by divesting units that aren’t central to
its strategy, Klein said in October. Heads of the units
previously reported to Pat Kelleher, the executive vice president
who oversees insurance. Klein served as acting chief executive
officer from the time of Michael Fraizer’s departure in May until
Tom McInerney took over in January.  Klein “will lead the related priorities of increasing
International Protection’s and Wealth Management’s value and
exploring options to realize that value,” McInerney said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
