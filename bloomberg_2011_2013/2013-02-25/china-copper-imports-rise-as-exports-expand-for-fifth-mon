Refined-copper  imports  by China, the
biggest consumer, gained 1.8 percent in January ahead of a
seasonal pick-up in demand as exports climbed for a fifth month.  Inbound shipments were 243,174 metric tons last month,
compared with 238,828 tons in December, according to data e-
mailed by the General Administration of Customs today. Exports
climbed for a fifth month to 26,213 tons from 25,486 tons in
December, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  More arrivals of the metal used in wire and cable are
likely to add pressure on local prices that have slumped 4
percent this month as China’s manufacturing expanded at a slower
pace in February than a month earlier. More traders may choose
to ship the metal out of the nation as domestic stockpiles swell.  “A higher level of imports, coupled with huge local
stockpiles in  China , isn’t good news for prices,” Liang Lijuan,
an analyst at Cofco Futures Co., said by phone from Beijing
today. “There are still concerns regarding how strong the
demand recovery will be in this spring.”  Net imports climbed to 216,961 tons in January from 213,342
tons in December, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
the customs data.  The preliminary reading of a Purchasing Managers’ Index was
50.4 in February, according to a statement from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics today. That compares with the 52.3
final reading for January and the 52.2 median estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. A number above 50 indicates
expansion.  Inventories tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained
5.6 percent, the most in four months, to 207,709 tons last week,
according to bourse data on Feb. 15. That was the highest level
in a month. London Metal Exchange copper  stockpiles  rose to
424,350 tons as of Feb. 22, the highest since November 2011.  Copper-concentrate  imports  by China declined for the first
time in seven months to 761,098 tons from 935,303 tons in
December, the highest since Bloomberg started compiling the data
in 2004.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
