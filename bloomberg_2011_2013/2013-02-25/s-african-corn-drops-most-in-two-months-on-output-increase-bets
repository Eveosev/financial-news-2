South African corn futures fell the
most in more than two months on speculation the country’s Crop
Estimates Committee will say output of the grain will rise 5.9
percent this season from last year.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
dropped 3.5 percent, the most since Dec. 2, to 1,997 rand ($226)
a metric ton by the close in Johannesburg. The yellow variety
for delivery in the same month declined 3.1 percent to 1,994.80
rand a ton.  A median estimate of six traders surveyed by Bloomberg on
Feb. 20 showed that farmers may harvest 12.5 million tons of
corn this season. The range was from 11.95 million tons to 12.8
million tons. It compares with 11.8 million tons produced in the
2011-12 season. The Crop Estimates Committee will release the
data tomorrow.  “The crop estimates report is coming out tomorrow and the
market is positive it will be higher for maize,” Brink van Wyk,
a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria . “The
surplus will be high.”  South Africa, the largest producer of corn, also known as
maize, on the continent, produced 12.8 million tons in 2010, the
biggest crop since 1982. Meal made from white corn is one of the
country’s staple food and the yellow variety is mainly used as
animal feed.  Wheat for March delivery fell 0.9 percent to 3,380 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
