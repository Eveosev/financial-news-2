Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-biggest lender, rose the most in seven months following a
report  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  plans to sell a stake of
Citizens Financial Group Inc. in an initial public offering.  Toronto-Dominion rose 1.8 percent to C$85.80 at 10:54 a.m.
in Toronto, the biggest intraday gain since July 27. About 2.26
million shares traded hands, the seventh-biggest trading volume
in Canada today. It  rose the most  in the broader  S&P/TSX
Financials Index (STFINL)  of 44 companies, which advanced 0.5 percent.  Royal Bank of  Scotland  will announce it intends to sell a
15 percent to 25 percent stake in Rhode Island-based Citizens
when it reports earnings on Feb. 28, a person with knowledge of
the plans said Saturday. Toronto-Dominion earlier held informal
talks to buy Citizens, the  New York  Post reported Aug. 3,
without saying where it got the information.  “Market concern over a potential acquisition of Citizens
has weighed on the TD quote for the past six months,” Sumit Malhotra, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Markets wrote in a
note today to clients.  Malhotra said in a Nov. 6 note that “the financial and
operating risk associated with a purchase the size of Citizens”
would be difficult for Toronto-Dominion, which has more bank
branches in the U.S. than it does in Canada.  Toronto-Dominion is scheduled to release fiscal first-
quarter earnings this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
