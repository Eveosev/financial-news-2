India, seeking to generate 30
gigawatts of power from renewable sources by 2017, increased
capacity by 12.4 gigawatts in the past three years by adding
wind, biomass, solar and hydro plants.  Wind power accounted for the biggest increase, at 8.3
gigawatts, the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy said in a
 statement  on the government’s website. India added 1.8 gigawatts
of biomass, 1.2 gigawatts of solar and 1.1 gigawatt of
hydropower in the three years through January.  The South Asian country’s current renewables capacity
totals about 26 gigawatts, New and Renewable Energy Minister
Farooq Abdullah said in November. The state of  Tamil Nadu 
installed the most clean-power capacity in the past three years,
followed by Gujarat, the statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
