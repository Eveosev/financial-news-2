The  Chicago Blackhawks  are yet to
lose a National Hockey League game in regulation this season,
beating Columbus 1-0 to improve their record to 15-0-3.  Goaltender Corey Crawford made 28 saves for the shutout
last night in  Chicago  as the Blackhawks won their fifth game in
a row. With at least one point in 18 consecutive games, the
Blackhawks extended the NHL’s best streak to start a season.  Chicago leads the NHL with 15 wins and three overtime
losses for 33 points.  Andrew Shaw scored the game’s lone goal with one minute, 27
seconds left in the second period and Crawford, back in goal
after missing four games with an unspecified upper-body injury,
recorded his second shutout of the season.  The Blue Jackets (5-12-2) lost for the fifth time on their
six-game road trip.  The Boston Bruins extended their best start to a season
since 1976-77 by beating the Florida Panthers 4-1 yesterday to
improve to 11-2-2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
