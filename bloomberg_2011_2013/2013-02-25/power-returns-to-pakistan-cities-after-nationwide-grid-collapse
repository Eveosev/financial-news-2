Electricity supplies were restored
to several cities in Pakistan after a grid collapse overnight
left much of the country without power.  The blackout began at 11:45 p.m. yesterday with a technical
failure at a privately run 1,200 megawatt power plant operated
by  Hub Power Co. (HUBC) , the country’s second-biggest generator, Power
Secretary Rai Sikandar said in comments broadcast live on
television.  Other power plants, including those at the Tarbela and
Mangla dams, tripped as they were unable to meet demand. All
major Pakistani cities including Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore,
Quetta and Peshawar were plunged into darkness.  “Power has been restored in 80 percent of the country
while the rest will see electricity before noon today,”
Sikandar said in Islamabad today. “It’s too early to speculate
why that happened and we will inform the people after a detailed
investigation.”  Pakistan’s electricity demand stands at 14,400 megawatts,
while the country provides 11,405 megawatts to consumers, the
power ministry said on its  website . The nation’s power deficit
has triggered street protests and closed factories, raising the
pressure on the government of President Asif Ali Zardari ahead
of elections due in early May.  The nationwide outage was the third to hit  Pakistan  in the
last decade, Dawn said without giving details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
