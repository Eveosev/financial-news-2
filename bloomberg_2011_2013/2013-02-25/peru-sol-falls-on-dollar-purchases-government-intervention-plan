Peru ’s sol declined toward a three-
month low as the central bank bought dollars and the government
pledged last week to help stem the local currency’s gains.  The sol depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5835 per dollar at
today’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency ended Feb. 21 at 2.5890, the weakest since Nov. 23.  The central bank said it bought $10 million of U.S.
currency in the foreign exchange market today. The government
will buy at least $1 billion to service foreign debt as part of
the plan to offset dollar flows, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Feb. 18. It will also prepay $1.8 billion in
multilateral debt and add $1.2 billion to contingency reserves.  “All this intervention is leading banks to go long
dollars,” said Walther Benavides, a bond trader at Banco
Continental SA in  Lima .  The yield on Peru’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond due
in August 2020 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3.79 percent at 3:39 p.m., according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The price decreased 0.23 centimo to 125.98
centimos per sol.  Yields on the sol bonds are climbing on speculation the
government will auction domestic debt, Benavides said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
