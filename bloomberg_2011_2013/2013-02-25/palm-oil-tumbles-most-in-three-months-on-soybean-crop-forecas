Palm oil  fell the most since
November as forecast for a record U.S. soybean crop next year
deepened concern that global cooking oil supplies may increase
and a tax on exports will curb demand for Malaysian supplies.  The contract for delivery in May dropped as much as 2.8
percent to 2,463 ringgit ($794) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the biggest drop for the most-active
contract since Nov. 12, and ended the morning session at 2,479
ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures gained 2.1 percent last week.  Farmers in the U.S. will expand soybeans sowing, taking the
next harvest to an all-time high of 3.4 billion bushels, and
doubling inventories by Aug. 31, 2014 to 250 million bushels,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said Feb. 22.  Soybean oil 
futures fell for a third day to the lowest level since Jan. 15
in  Chicago  today. Wheat and corn also fell.  “Palm oil prices fell in line with soybean oil, not just
due to fundamental factors but also because of a stronger dollar
and fund selling across the grains markets,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at LT International Futures Sdn. in
Kuala Lumpur. “Palm oil exports may be lower until the first
half of March at least because of the increase in tax.”  Shipments from Malaysia, the second-largest producer,
climbed 4.6 percent to 1.15 million tons in the first 25 days of
February from a month earlier, independent surveyor Intertek
said today. The gain was smaller than the 18 percent increase in
the first 15 days of the month, data showed.  Export Taxes  Crude palm exports from  Malaysia  will be taxed at 4.5
percent in March after shipments were allowed at zero duty in
the previous two months. Indonesia, biggest producer, also
raised the export tax for March to 10.5 percent from 9 percent
this month, the nation’s trade ministry said on Feb. 22.  Soybean oil for May delivery fell as much as 0.7 percent to
50.38 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. The cooking
oil’s  premium  to palm oil was at $315 a ton today. The two are
the most consumed edible oils in the world. Soybeans for May
delivery was little changed at $14.43 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September slid 3.6 percent
to 6,812  yuan  ($1,092) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell 3.1 percent to
8,430 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
