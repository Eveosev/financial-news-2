Iran  has added storage for as much as
500,000 barrels of oil, the third such facility it established
in southern Bushehr province in the past year, the Oil Ministry
news website,  Shana , reported.  The new facility will increase Iran’s storage capacity in
Bushehr’s Bahregan region to 4 million barrels, according to the
report, which cited Mohammad-Bagher Soleimani, Iranian Offshore
Oil Co.’s production director.  Iranian Offshore Oil plans to raise storage capacity in
Bahregan to 8.1 million barrels in 2013, said the state
company’s managing director, Mahmoud Zirakchianzadeh, according
to the report yesterday.  International sanctions against Iran over its nuclear
program have hampered crude exports from one of the main
producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Imports of Iranian oil fell at least 36 percent in January to
less than 1 million barrels a day, and the nation’s output
slumped to the lowest level in more than three decades, the
 International Energy Agency  said Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
