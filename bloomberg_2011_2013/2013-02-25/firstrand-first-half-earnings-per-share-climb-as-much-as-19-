FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ,  South Africa ’s
second-largest lender, said fiscal first-half profit a share
probably increased by as much as 19 percent.  Earnings excluding one-time items climbed by 24 percent to
29 percent in the six months to Dec. 31 from 103.3 cents a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based bank said in a statement today.  FirstRand  shares  rose as much as 3.2 percent, the most in
more than five weeks, and were 1.8 percent higher at 31.06 rand
as of 3:17 p.m. in Johannesburg trading. The stock has gained 26
percent over the past 12 months, making it the best performer
among South Africa’s four biggest banks.  FirstRand increased consumer lending in 2012 and added more
customers through its First National Bank unit even as the South
African economy slowed. The company, which is due to publish
full first-half results on March 5, also boosted earnings at its
vehicle financing unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
