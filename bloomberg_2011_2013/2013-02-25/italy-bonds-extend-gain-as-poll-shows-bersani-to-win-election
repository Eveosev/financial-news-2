Italian  government bonds  extended an
advance after a SkyTG24 Tecne poll showed Pier Luigi Bersani is
on track to win Italy’s parliamentary election.  The 10-year yield dropped 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, to 4.23 percent at 2:03 p.m. London time.
That’s the biggest intraday slide since Jan. 2, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
