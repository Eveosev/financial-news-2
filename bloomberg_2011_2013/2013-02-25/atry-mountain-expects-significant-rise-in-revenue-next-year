Tatry Mountain Resorts AS, an
operator of ski resorts in eastern  Europe , expects a
“significant” jump in revenue and profit next year helped by
an increase in clients, Chairman Bohus Hlavaty said.  “The start of the winter season has been good, with the
rising amount of visitors,” Hlavaty said at the presser in
Bratislava today. Half season winter revenue in resorts jumped
15 percent and hotel revenue in the three months ended Jan. 30
rose 3 percent, Hlavaty said.  Liptovsky Mikulas, Slovakia-based Tatry Mountain Resorts
reported today a net income for the 12 months ended Oct. 31 of
10.2 million euros ($13.5 million), up 13 percent, excluding
property re-evaluations, from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13
percent to 43.8 million euros, it said in a statement today.  Tatry Mountain Resorts operates ski centers and aqua parks
in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The company, whose shares
are traded on the Bratislava Stock Exchange, also listed stock
in Prague and Warsaw in October. Its bid for Polish state ski
lifts was rejected in January.  The company’s board will propose a dividend of 1.06 euro a
share, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
