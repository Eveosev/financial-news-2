Soybean crushers in  China , the
biggest importer, are draining inventories as they expect prices
to drop on  Brazil ’s record harvest, even as the country
struggles with shipping delays, said  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)   “We don’t carry excessive stocks of U.S. beans, which is
more expensive,” Chief Executive Officer Kuok Khoon Hong said
in a Feb. 22 interview, without giving figures. “Everybody is
waiting for prices to fall,” he said, referring to processors
in China. Wilmar is the country’s top cooking oil supplier.  Prices in  Chicago  slumped 19 percent from a record in
September as the crop in Brazil headed for a record, surpassing
the drought-hit U.S. harvest. Protests by dock workers and a
record backlog at Brazil’s ports raised concerns over delays and
prompted crushers to buy U.S. supplies last week. Canceled
contracts beat purchases in the week to Feb. 14, turning total
net sales negative in the five-day period for the first time
since 2010, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Deliveries of about 7 million metric tons are held up at
ports in Brazil, pushing up prices in China, Kuok said in
Singapore, where the company is based.  Futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange fell 1.2 percent
to close at 4,797  yuan  ($770) a ton today after advancing to
4,918 yuan on Feb. 22, the highest level since Nov. 7. On the
Chicago Board of Trade, the most-active contract climbed 0.3
percent to $14.48 a bushel, after a 2.1 percent advance last
week. Prices reached an all-time high $17.89 a bushel on Sept. 4.  Brazil Strike  Dock workers in Brazil held up loading on Feb. 22 at the
Port of Santos in a protest over job security as they consider a
strike that would disrupt shipments of everything from sugar to
soybeans and corn. The country’s ports have 192 ships waiting to
load 10.8 million tons of commodities, compared with 90 ships
waiting to load 4.1 million tons a year earlier, researcher SA
Commodities said Feb. 22. The country is set to by the biggest
exporter this year.  China bought 410,000 tons from the U.S., the USDA said Feb.
22. The purchases last week were driven by concerns over
shipping disruptions in Brazil, researcher Shanghai JC
Intelligence Co. said the same day.  Cancellations beat new purchases of U.S. beans, pulling
total net sales for the current and next marketing year to minus
57,526 tons in the week to Feb. 14 from 235,818 tons a week
earlier, USDA data show. That’s the first time  sales  were
negative in a week since March 2010, according the data.  Waiting for Bottom  “Chinese buyers are just waiting to see what the bottom
will be,” said  Tetsu Emori , a Tokyo-based commodity fund
manager at Astmax Investment Management Inc., referring to
prices. The delay wouldn’t cut total imports, he said. “As soon
as prices decline, the Chinese will come in to buy.”  Brazil  shipped  23.9 million tons to China in calendar 2012,
compared with almost 26 million tons  delivered  by the U.S.,
Chinese customs data showed. As of Feb. 14, about 1.76 million
tons of U.S. beans sold to China remain to be shipped in the
marketing year ending Aug. 31, down from 3.04 million tons a
year earlier, USDA data show.  China’s imports are forecast to advance to 62 million tons
in the year through September from 59.2 million tons in 2011-
2012, the Hamburg, Germany-based industry researcher Oil World
said in a report last month.  Brazil’s  harvest  will surge 26 percent this year from 2011-
2012. The worst drought since the 1930s destroyed crops in the
U.S., last year’s top producer and shipper. China’s share of
global imports will reach 65 percent this year from 63.5 percent
in 2011-2012, the USDA estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
