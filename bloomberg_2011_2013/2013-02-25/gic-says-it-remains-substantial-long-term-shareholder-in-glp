Government of Singapore Investment
Corp. said its sale of a stake in  Global Logistic Properties
Ltd. (GLP)  is part of its rebalancing of its holdings and that it
remains a “substantial” long-term shareholder in the real
estate company.  GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund that’s Global
Logistic’s biggest shareholder, is raising S$1.5 billion ($1.2
billion) selling part of its stake in GLP, according to a term
sheet obtained by Bloomberg News today.  “GIC has been the major shareholder in GLP since its
establishment,” the state fund said in an e-mailed statement
today. “We are pleased with the company’s execution of its
strategies and are confident of its long-term prospects.”  The stake on offer is about 13 percent of the total shares
outstanding of Singapore-based Global Logistic, according to
data compiled by  Bloomberg News .  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) , is the
only bookrunner on the sale, according to the term sheet. Global
Logistic is the biggest owner of Japan industrial properties.  GIC is offering 595.7 million shares at S$2.60 apiece,
according to the term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. That’s
the lower end of the range of S$2.60 to S$2.66 apiece and a 5.5
percent discount from Global Logistic’s closing price of S$2.75
yesterday, according to an earlier term sheet obtained by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
