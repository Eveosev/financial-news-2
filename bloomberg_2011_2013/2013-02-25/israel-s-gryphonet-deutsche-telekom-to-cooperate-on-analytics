Israel’s  Gryphonet Ltd. , a maker of
smartphone analytics software, will partner with  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE)  to market its products to application developers.  The Herzliya Pituach-based startup, founded by Irit
Rapaport, has developed AppRight, software that shows mobile
application developers how their product is performing and gives
them data about its impact on devices, including memory issues,
high battery consumption and crash reports, the company said in
an e-mailed statement today ahead of this week’s Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona.  “Providing accurate analytics to application developers is
a growing market estimated at billions of dollars,” Rapaport,
who is also the company’s chief executive officer, said in a
phone interview on Feb. 22. without providing further
information about the deal.  The software will initially be used on Android devices.
Gryphonet expects to have versions for Apple Inc.’s iPhone and
 Microsoft Corp.’s (MSFT)  Windows operating systems “in the next 12
months,” Rapaport said.  Gryphonet, founded in 2009, has been funded by angel
investors to date, Rapaport said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
