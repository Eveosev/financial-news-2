Philippine  government bonds  due 2037
fell for a second day on speculation some investors judged
recent gains excessive after the yield reached a record low last
week. The peso was steady.  The rate has dropped 52 basis points in the past month
after Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said
Jan. 25 the nation is set to win its first investment-grade
 credit rating  in the first half. Authorities are looking at an
“array of instruments” to manage capital inflows, Assistant
Governor Cyd Amador told reporters in Manila on Feb. 22.  “Some players decided to lock in gains,” said Jan Briace Santos, a debt trader who helps manage the equivalent of $18
billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in  Manila . “The market may
also be waiting for more developments on plans by the BSP on how
they will manage inflows.”  The yield on the government’s 6.125 percent bonds due
October 2037 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 4.88 percent as of 4:08 p.m. in Manila, according to prices
from Tradition Financial Services. The rate touched 4.87 percent
on Feb. 21, the lowest since the notes were issued in October
2012.  Policy makers meet to review borrowing costs on March 14
after reducing rates on the central bank’s special-deposit
accounts last month to curb speculation in the peso.  The Philippine currency was little changed at 40.688 per
dollar, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It has appreciated 5.2
percent in the past year, the best performance among  Asia ’s 11
most-active currencies. One-month implied volatility in the
peso, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to
price options, was unchanged at 3.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
