China , the world’s second-biggest
oil consumer, boosted net diesel exports to the highest level in
27 months in January as domestic stockpiles increased.  Overseas sales of the fuel exceeded imports by 309,273
metric tons, according to data e-mailed by the General
Administration of Customs today. That’s 22 percent higher than
December and the most since October 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Overseas diesel sales rose at the same time commercial
inventories of the fuel jumped 18 percent at the end of January
from a month earlier, a report from Xinhua News Agency’s China
Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals newsletter said Feb. 21. That’s
equivalent to 9.48 million tons, the highest since June,
according to Bloomberg calculations.  Diesel exports  last month rose threefold from a year ago to
379,583 tons, while imports increased 38.5 percent to 70,310
tons, today’s data show.  Gasoline exports  climbed 12 percent to
315,345 tons, while imports were at 15 tons.  China’s imports of natural gas through the Central Asia
pipeline, mostly from  Turkmenistan , rose 45 percent to 1.49
million tons last month while  liquefied natural gas imports 
gained 16 percent to 1.51 million tons.  Crude imports  from  Iran  fell 36.9 percent from a year
earlier to 1.32 million tons, according to the data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
