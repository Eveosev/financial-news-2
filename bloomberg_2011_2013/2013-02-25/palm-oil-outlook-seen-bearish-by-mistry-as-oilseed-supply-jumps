Palm oil  probably will drop this
year after Asian producers boosted acreage and global oilseed
supplies rose, said  Dorab Mistry , a Godrej International Ltd.
director who’s traded the commodity for more than 30 years.
Prices fell, erasing this year’s gain.  The expansion of palm estates will increase output, while
bad weather that disrupted soybean supplies in 2012 will prompt
farmers to ramp up harvests this year, said Mistry, who is
scheduled to speak next week at an annual palm conference in
Kuala Lumpur arranged by  Bursa Malaysia Bhd. (BURSA)   Malaysia  is the
world’s largest supplier after  Indonesia .  Palm, used in food and fuels, averaged the second-highest
ever last year even as supply and stockpiles surged to records.
Lower prices would help to cut global food costs at the same
time that U.S. Department of Agriculture Chief Economist Joe Glauber forecasts corn and soybeans will slump as growers boost
crops in response to last year’s weather-driven disruptions.  “High-price spirals always lead to a strong supply
response, we are seeing one in 2013,” Mistry said in an e-mail
reply to questions. “The cyclical  bull market  in  commodities 
also made palm plantations extremely profitable and that led to
aggressive expansion of acreage. These two factors have created
a bearish outlook for palm oil for 2013.”  Mr. Titanic  Palm lost 2.2 percent to 2,417 ringgit ($779) a ton on the
Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, a unit of Bursa Malaysia, today for
the lowest close in five weeks. Futures are 0.9 percent lower
this year. Mistry, who earned the nickname Mr. Titanic after he
correctly compared vegetable oil prices to the ill-fated liner
in 1998, is  scheduled to speak  March 6 at the Palm and Lauric
Oils Conference & Exhibition. A third year of losses in 2013
would be the worst run since at least 1996.  Futures had been forecast to rally to 2,800 ringgit a ton
by the end of March as demand rebounded and record stockpiles
dropped, according to the median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey published on Jan. 22. The  stockpiles  held around the all-
time high in January as output, at 1.6 million tons, was 24
percent higher than in the same month last year, according to
data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  Malaysia, which introduced duty-free shipments from Jan. 1
to clear the holdings, will boost the tariff to 4.5 percent next
month, potentially limiting sales.  India , the largest cooking
oil consumer after  China , imposed a 2.5 percent import tax on
palm and may increase that in the nation’s budget on Feb. 28,
according to the Solvent Extractors Association.  ‘Mini Crash’  “Production is slightly outpacing demand by 1 percent to 2
percent, so stock inventory will remain high, pressuring
prices,” said Chris de Lavigne, global vice president of
consulting at  Frost & Sullivan , who’s also scheduled to speak at
the  Kuala Lumpur  conference. “If coupled with a bumpy economy,
then we could see another mini crash in prices.”  Palm output  in Malaysia will total 18.9 million tons in
2013, matching the biggest-ever crop in 2011, the Malaysian Palm
Oil Board forecasts. Indonesia may harvest a record 30 million
tons as more trees mature, Derom Bangun, chairman of that
nation’s board, said in Jakarta on Feb. 18. Bangun is also
scheduled to speak at the conference.  Global palm stockpiles will climb to a record 7.203 million
tons this season, buttressed by the highest-ever output of 53.3
million tons, the USDA predicts. While holdings in Malaysia
peaked at 2.63 million tons in December and fell 1.9 percent
last month,  Ben Santoso , an analyst at DBS Vickers Securities
Pte in  Singapore , forecasts that they are likely to stay above 2
million tons in 2013. Last year, they averaged 2.1 million tons,
the highest ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Annual Losses  Palm will decline 2.8 percent to 2,350 ringgit a ton by the
end of June, according to the median of 10 estimates from
analysts and traders compiled by Bloomberg. The price slumped 23
percent last year following a 16 percent drop in 2011.  To try to spur a decline in the stockpiles, Malaysia’s
government cut taxes on exports, replacing a 23 percent tariff
from Jan. 1 with a sliding scale from 4.5 percent to 8.5
percent. With prices below the threshold that triggers the
lowest rate, shipments in January and this month were duty-free.
Exports climbed 4.6 percent to 1,153,852 tons in the first 25
days of February from the same period in January, said Intertek.  Palm stockpiles will be reduced on “strong” demand for
biofuels and food, James Fry, chairman of Oxford, England-based
LMC International Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to
questions from Bloomberg. He declined to elaborate on his views
before his presentation at the event in Kuala Lumpur next week.  Ofon’s Outlook  While palm may bottom in the second quarter, averaging
2,500 ringgit a ton, prices will probably rally to 2,750 ringgit
in the third quarter and 2,900 ringgit in the final three
months,  Abah Ofon , a Singapore-based analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc, said in a report on Feb. 5. Faster economic
growth in China and India, the largest buyers, will boost
demand, Ofon wrote, linking rising per-capita incomes to
increased palm consumption.  Growth in China, the second-largest economy, will speed up
to 8.1 percent in 2013 from 7.8 percent, according to the median
of forecasts tracked by Bloomberg. Palm demand in China will
gain 7.9 percent to 6.3 million tons in 2012-2013, more than
double the level in 2002-2003, according to the USDA. Inventory
at ports in China totaled 1.09 million tons, 30,000 tons less
than at the start of the month, Grain.gov.cn said Feb. 19.  Malaysia will extend nationwide a program to use a 5
percent palm blend in biodiesel and introduce a 10 percent
blend, according to Plantation Industries and Commodities
Minister Bernard Dompok. In Indonesia, a government plan to
raise blending this year may require 2 million tons of palm,
Deputy Trade Minister Bayu Krisnamurthi said in a mobile-phone
text message Feb. 18. A record 5.6 million tons was used for
fuel in 2012, according to Oil World, a Hamburg-based research
company.  Palm’s Discount  Palm’s discount to gasoil, a so-called middle distillate
comparable with diesel, was $181.66 a ton today versus a five-
year average that shows the tropical oil at a premium of $61.21,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., farmers will boost soybean planting this year,
taking production to an all-time high of 3.4 billion bushels,
and doubling the country’s inventories by Aug. 31, 2014 to 250
million bushels, the USDA said on Feb. 22. Global production
will rebound 13 percent to 269 million tons in 2012-2013, led by
the biggest-ever harvests in Brazil and  Argentina , USDA data
show. Soybeans, which peaked at $17.89 a bushel in  Chicago  in
September, traded at $14.29 today.  Corn prices will plunge 33 percent and soybeans will drop
27 percent this year as U.S. harvests expand to the biggest
ever, according to Glauber, the USDA chief economist. Reserves
of the crops should be rebuilt, he said at the agency’s annual
outlook forum in Arlington,  Virginia  on Feb. 21.  Global  food costs  as tracked by the  United Nations ’ Rome-
based Food & Agriculture Organization were unchanged in January
after dropping in the preceding three months. The agency’s 55-
item World Food Price Index fell 0.5 percent last year after
declining 5.6 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
