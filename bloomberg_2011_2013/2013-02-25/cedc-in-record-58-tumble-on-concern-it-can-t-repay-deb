Central European Distribution Corp. (CEDC) ,
the Polish vodka distiller rescued by Russian billionaire
Roustam Tariko last year, proposed swapping bonds for equity to
cut its debt by more than $750 million.  The company, which made a deal in December to get as much
as $107 million in new capital from Tariko five months after he
bought its debt, extended the offer to bondholders after
convertible notes due next month sank and its stock plunged as
much as 65 percent in New York yesterday. CEDC, maker of the
Zubrowka and Parliament brands, said it’s also considering a
pre-packaged bankruptcy plan in  Delaware , according to a  filing 
yesterday.  Tariko, who  owns  19.5 percent of CEDC, signed an agreement
Dec. 28 giving him operational control in exchange for the
capital after Moody’s Investors Service cut the company’s credit
rating on concern over losses for bond investors. Yields on
CEDC’s dollar-denominated bonds due 2016 doubled to 33.76
percent between May and November last year, and have fallen 96
basis points since the December deal with Tariko.  “The company believes that a successful restructuring of
both the convertible senior notes and the senior secured notes
will improve its financial strength and flexibility,” Warsaw-
based CEDC said in PRNewswire statement issued yesterday. Should
the plan not find support among bond and shareholders the
company may decide to file for bankruptcy, according to the
statement.  The offer, which expires March 22, would give holders of
CEDC’s 3 percent convertible bonds due next month 8.86 new
 shares (CDC)  in exchange for each $1,000 principal amount of their
notes, the company said.  Bonds Slide  Investors in the 9.125 percent 2016 bonds issued by CEDC
Finance Corporation International Inc. will receive 16.52 new
shares and $508.21 principal of the company’s 2020 debt. On the
8.875 percent 2016 bonds, holders are being offered 22.18 new
shares for each 1,000 euro principal amount and $682.37
principal of the 6.5 percent 2020 bonds, according to the
statement.  CEDC sank 12 percent to 55 cents at 10:18 a.m. in New York
today, heading for the lowest close in more than 12 years. The
decline followed a 55 percent drop yesterday.  The price on the convertible dollar notes due March 15
slipped 7.7 percent to 24 cents on the dollar yesterday, down
from as high as 97 cents in July, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Tariko’s Roust Trading Ltd. and a committee of 2016 note
investors have proposed an alternative to the bond-for-equity
exchange offer being tabled by the company, CEDC said yesterday.
This is yet to be formally presented to the board of directors.  ‘Final Direction’  “The final direction of the restructuring will be based on
the outcome of the solicitation process,” CEDC said in the
statement. “If sufficient notes are tendered in the exchange
and shareholders approve the plan, CEDC will consummate the
exchange offers.”  Should the company proceed with the bankruptcy plan, it
isn’t expected to affect operations in  Poland ,  Hungary , Russia
and Ukraine, according to the statement.  Shares of CEDC also tumbled in Warsaw today, losing 44
percent to a record-low 2.08 zloty, or 65 cents. The stock fell
20 percent yesterday.  James Archbold, CEDC’s head of  investor relations , resigned
Feb. 22, according to a report posted Feb. 24 by GPWInfoStrefa,
a news portal run by the Polish Press Agency in cooperation with
the  Warsaw Stock Exchange. (GPW)  An e-mail sent yesterday to CEDC’s
investor relations address wasn’t returned.  Market Value  CEDC erased about 50 percent of its market value in 2012
amid slumping sales, rising liabilities and management
transitions. Revenue fell 8.7 percent in the third quarter to
$191.3 million, after shrinking in the previous two quarters,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Chief Executive Officer William Carey stepped down in July.  Moody’s cut CEDC’s  bond rating  by one level in January to
Caa3, nine steps below investment grade, on concern the company
hadn’t secured “adequate financing” to repay the convertible
notes maturing next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
