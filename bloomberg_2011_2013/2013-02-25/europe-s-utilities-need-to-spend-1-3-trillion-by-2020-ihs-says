European utilities need to invest
about 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) on new infrastructure by
the end of the decade to secure energy supplies, said  IHS Inc. (IHS)   About 750 billion euros is needed for power generation, 90
billion for transmission lines and 150 billion euros to expand
gas supplies and build pipelines, IHS said in a research report.  “Today the required investment is lacking,” said Michael
Stoppard, chief global gas researcher. “Because of the long
lead time to develop energy assets, it is imperative that the
right investment framework be put in place as soon as possible
to ensure long-term stability of  Europe ’s energy system.”  Europe has to ensure energy independence as aging power
plants close and gas imports rise, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
