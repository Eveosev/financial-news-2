Russian  unemployment  fell to a
record low of 5 percent in August and September last year, less
than the initially reported 5.2 percent, revised data released
by the Federal Statistics Service show.  Last month’s reading of 6 percent was unchanged, the
Moscow-based service said in a report e-mailed today. December’s
rate was revised downward to 5.1 percent from an initially
reported 5.3 percent.  Russia’s jobless rate was reduced for every month last
year, the service said, citing new calculations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
