Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  units
bought hundreds of millions of dollars in claims on defunct
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to federal court
filings.  Among the largest trades were by Elliott Management Corp.
units and Empyrean Investments LLC, according to the filings,
made mostly over the weekend. The filings also show at least two
Goldman Sachs sales of Lehman claims.  The former investment bank has so far paid creditors about
9 cents on the dollar, out of the average of 18 cents on the
dollar it has said it might raise by about 2016. Its next
payment is due on April 4, it said on Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
