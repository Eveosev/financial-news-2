Anne Hathaway  won the Oscar award
for best supporting actress for her portrayal of the ill-fated
Fantine in the musical “ Les Miserables ,” as Hollywood honored
the best work of 2012.  Hathaway, 30, beat rivals including Sally Field, who played
the volatile wife of America’s 16th president in “Lincoln.”
The award, announced at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, was the
third for  Universal Pictures ’ “Les Miserables,” which won
Academy Awards makeup and sound mixing.  “Les Miserables” is also nominated for best picture. The
film, a big-screen version of the Broadway musical, stars  Hugh Jackman  as reformed convict Jean Valjean and  Russell Crowe  as
his tormentor, the policeman Javert. It was Hathaway’s second
nomination.  The movie’s eight nominations also include best actor for
Jackman. The play and film are based on Victor Hugo’s 19th
century novel about Valjean’s quest for redemption after being
sentenced to prison for stealing bread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
