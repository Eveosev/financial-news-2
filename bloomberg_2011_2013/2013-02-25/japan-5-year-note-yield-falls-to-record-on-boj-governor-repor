Japan ’s five-year note yields slid
to an all-time low as the government neared a decision on who
will run the central bank and expand monetary easing measures.  Ten-year yields slid to a two-month low while the yen fell
against all its major peers. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely
to nominate Asian Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda as
 Bank of Japan (8301)  governor and Kikuo Iwata as a deputy at the
central bank, according to a government official with knowledge
of the discussions.  “Bond investors are expecting the BOJ to increase
government-debt purchases regardless of who becomes the next BOJ
governor,” said Toru Yamamoto, the chief strategist at Daiwa
Securities Co. “Kikuo Iwata is seen as aggressive toward
monetary easing.”  The  yield  on the five-year note declined one basis point to
0.12 percent as of 3:35 p.m. in Tokyo, the lowest since the
government started to offer the securities in February 2000. The
0.1 percent debt maturing in December 2017 added 0.048 yen to
99.904 yen, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest inter-dealer debt broker.  The benchmark 10-year yield declined two basis points to
0.7 percent, the lowest since Dec. 12. Ten-year bond futures
advanced as much as 0.24 to 144.74, the most since Dec. 11.
Rates on 20-year and 30-year bond slide 1 1/2 basis points to
1.71 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.  Abe is set to reshape the leadership of the BOJ that has
adopted his 2 percent inflation target and plans to begin open-
ended asset purchases next year. Current Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa and two deputies will step aside on March 19.  Iwata has said the central bank should buy bonds of five
years maturity and longer to create inflation expectations.
Kuroda said this month that the central bank has many tools to
achieve a 2 percent price target.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said today Abe will
present nominees to parliament this week, though a final
decision hasn’t been made.  To contact the reporters on this story:
