Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon Ltd. (WBO) , a
South African builder, said more residential projects at its
Australian unit helped boost revenue by 43 percent in the six
months through December.  Net income rose 5.4 percent to 380.1 million rand ($42.8
million, compared with 360.6 million rand a year earlier, while
sales increased to 12 billion rand, the company said in a
statement today.  “All divisions showed increased revenue with a major
increase of 61 percent for Australia resulting from increased
activity in the high-rise residential market,” WBHO said.  WBHO shares closed 2.4 percent higher in Johannesburg on
152.50 rand. The  stock  has declined 2.8 percent this year
compared with a 1.3 percent gain in the  FTSE/JSE Africa
Construction & Building Materials Index. (JCBDM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
