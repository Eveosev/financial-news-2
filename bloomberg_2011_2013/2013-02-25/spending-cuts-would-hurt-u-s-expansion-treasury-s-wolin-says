The across-the-board government
spending cuts, known as sequestration and set to kick in March
1, would threaten U.S. economic expansion and must be avoided,
Acting Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said.  “What we cannot do -- what would be a grave and
unnecessary mistake -- is to deliberately throw sand in the
gears of our recovery,” Wolin said in written remarks prepared
for delivery to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs today.
“Congress must replace these arbitrary and across-the-board
cuts before they cause serious harm to the middle class and to
our economy.”  While President  Barack Obama  and congressional Republicans
are trading blame for the impasse on the automatic cuts, neither
side is expecting an agreement that would allow the U.S. to
avert $85 billion of spending cuts in the final seven months of
this fiscal year and $1.2 trillion over the next nine years.  Wolin has been acting as the head of the Treasury
Department since Timothy F. Geithner left last month. The Senate
plans to vote on Jack Lew, Obama’s nominee as Geithner’s
successor, this week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a
Democrat from Nevada, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
