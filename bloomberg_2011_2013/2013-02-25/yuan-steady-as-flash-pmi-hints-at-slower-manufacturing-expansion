The  yuan  was little changed, after a
run of four weekly declines, as a report suggested Chinese
manufacturing growth is slowing this month.  A preliminary reading for the Purchasing Managers Index
published by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics was 50.4,
data showed today. That compares with the 52.3 final reading for
January and the 52.2 median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. A number above 50 indicates expansion. The Communist
Party’s Central Committee will meet Feb. 26-28 to discuss policy
changes, while the Bank of England said Feb. 22 it plans to sign
a deal soon on a three-year currency swap arrangement with the
People’s Bank of China.  “The Flash PMI surprised the market on the downside while
 China ’s leadership will soon hold major annual meetings,” said
Stella Lee, president of Success Wealth Management Ltd. in Hong
Kong. “The yuan is likely to be rangebound in the short term as
investors are waiting for clearer policy directions.”  The yuan closed at 6.2339 per dollar in  Shanghai , little
changed from last week’s close of 6.2351, prices from the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System show. The currency lost 0.32
percent in the last four weeks.  The People’s Bank of China cut the  reference  rate by 0.03
percent to 6.2892, the weakest since Feb. 7. Spot prices are
allowed to diverge a maximum 1 percent from the fixing.  Dim Sum bonds returned 0.3 percent in the five days through
Feb. 22, contributing to a record 25-week winning streak in
which the securities gained 4.3 percent, a Bank of China index
shows. The securities, which are denominated in yuan and traded
in Hong Kong, yield 3.97 percent on average.  The currency climbed 0.05 percent to 6.2310 per dollar in
Hong Kong’s offshore market, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were steady at
6.3240, a 1.4 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.33
percent this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
