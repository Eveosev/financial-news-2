Eurasia Drilling Ltd. and  C.A.T. Oil
AG (O2C) , oil-service providers in  Russia , are set to gain from an
increase in investment by the country’s biggest crude producers,
 Renaissance Capital  said as it resumed coverage of the industry.  “We view oilfield-services companies as the best exposure
to rising capex,” Ildar Davletshin and Artem Kvas, analysts at
Renaissance in Moscow, wrote today in a research note. “The era
of cheap conventional oil in Russia is over.”  Oil producers are spending more to tap hard-to-recover
reserves as traditional fields become depleted. Russia has
proposed rebates on such resources to stimulate drilling, and
cut crude export taxes in 2011 to maintain its world-leading
output at more than 10 million barrels a day.  Meters drilled in Russia will increase at least 40 percent
by 2020 from 2012, benefiting Eurasia and C.A.T. Oil,
Renaissance said. The brokerage set a price estimate for Eurasia
of $45 per global depositary receipt and rated it a  buy . C.A.T.
Oil has a price estimate of 12 euros a share and a  buy  rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
