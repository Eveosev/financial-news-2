Michael Meister, the deputy floor
leader of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic
Union party, urged  Spain  to seek aid from the European Financial
Stability Facility as quickly as possible,  Rheinische Post  said.  Every day that the Madrid government continues to wait
“just makes the whole matter more expensive for all of us,”
Meister said, according to an interview with the newspaper. If
Spain doesn’t apply for aid soon, it will have to seek a bigger
amount in a few weeks, Rheinische Post cited Meister as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
