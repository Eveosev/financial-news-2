Scailex Corp. (SCIX)  dropped the most in
almost two weeks after Standard & Poor’s Maalot downgraded the
the telecommunications company to ilCC from ILBBB+.  The shares dropped 2.1 percent, the most since May 24, to
9.017 shekels at the close in Tel Aviv.  The outlook on the rating is negative, Standard & Poor’s
Maalot said, citing weak funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
