Thailand ’s baht advanced toward its
strongest level in two weeks and  government bonds  fell after
policy makers from the world’s leading economies agreed to
coordinate their response to Europe’s financial crisis.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index climbed the most
in eight weeks and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares rose
after Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said yesterday that
officials from the Group of Seven nations will work together to
help put the public finances of Spain and Greece on a
sustainable footing.  “Coordinated support will help stabilize the situation in
Europe,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center
for Economic Research in Tokyo. “That is leading to better
sentiment in emerging-market stocks and currencies. However,
this will be only temporary as the debt problem still
persists.”  The baht appreciated 0.6 percent to 31.44 per dollar as of
3:08 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 31.43 yesterday, the strongest level since
May 23. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.41 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
