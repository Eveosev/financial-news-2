Companies in the U.S. plan to boost
hiring even as confidence in the economy eases, a quarterly
survey of chief financial officers showed today.  The index of executives’ confidence in the world’s largest
economy fell to 56 in the second quarter from a one-year high of
59 in the previous three months, according to a report issued
today by Duke University/CFO Magazine. The executives said they
plan to increase payrolls by 2.5 percent over the next 12
months, up from 2.1 percent reported in the previous survey.  “CFOs indicate a level of hiring that would reduce the
national  unemployment rate  to near 7 percent within a year, if
all else remains constant,” said Kate O’Sullivan, CFO
Magazine’s editorial director. “More than one out of four U.S.
CFOs say their employees are maxed out, so the planned increase
in payrolls is long overdue.”  The figures are at odds with a report last week that showed
slower job growth. Payrolls climbed by 69,000 workers in May,
less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey, after a revised 77,000 gain in April that was smaller
than initially estimated, according to the June 1 data from the
Labor Department. The  jobless rate  rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1
percent.  A 2.5 percent increase would represent a gain of about 2.78
million private payroll jobs, which exclude government agencies,
or about 231,000 a month over the next year. Companies boosted
staff levels by 2.1 million workers in 2011.  The results are based on responses from 444 U.S. CFOs in a
survey concluded May 30.  To contact the report on this story:
