TNK-BP (BP/)  fell as  Citigroup Inc. (C)  called
the stock “high risk” on expectations of increased volatility
after BP Plc said it will pursue a sale of its 50 percent stake
in  Russia ’s third-largest oil producer.  TNK-BP fell as much as 4.7 percent and traded down 3.1
percent at 69.08 rubles at the close in Moscow, the lowest since
the shares were listed on the Micex exchange in December 2010.
The stock lost 10 percent on June 1 following BP’s statement.  “The odds appear to be that some change in ownership
structure may occur in the coming months, in turn likely
resulting in a change in the strategy pursued by the company,”
Citigroup analysts led by  Ronald Smith , said in an e-mailed
note. “That day could be months away, and while we retain our
12-month buy rating, we now assign a high risk code to reflect
the potential for volatility in the stock.”  The sale, which analysts said could raise at least $30
billion, would dismantle BP’s landmark venture, the largest
foreign investment in Russia’s oil industry. BP said it is
considering offers from unidentified suitors for its stake amid
a dispute with billionaire partners that has kept the company
from forming a board of directors since December.  AAR, which represents the billionaire partners with a 50
percent stake, said it made a preliminary proposal about buying
BP’s interest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
