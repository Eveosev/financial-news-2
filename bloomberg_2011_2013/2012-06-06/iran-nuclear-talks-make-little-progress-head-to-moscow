Iran’s top nuclear negotiator,  Saeed Jalili , will probably discuss the country’s nuclear program with
Russian officials in  St. Petersburg  tomorrow, the state-run Mehr
news service reported, without citing anyone.  Jalili was invited to attend an international security
summit in St. Petersburg by Nikolai Patrushev, the head of
Russia’s State Security Council, and may discuss Iran’s nuclear
program with Russian officials on the sidelines, Mehr reported.  Russia is scheduled to host the next round of nuclear talks
between Iran and the so-called 5+1 countries -- the five
permanent members of the  United Nations Security Council  and
Germany -- in Moscow on June 18-19. It will mark the third
attempt in three months to address worries that Iran’s atomic
energy program may be a cover for secret weapons work, and
Iran’s concerns about sanctions and diplomatic isolation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
