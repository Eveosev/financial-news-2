A fire at a Qatar property
development called The Pearl, being built by  United Development
Co. (UDCD) , caused 39 workers to be evacuated, Al-Sharq reported,
without saying where it got the information.  No one was killed, the newspaper said. The fire happened a
week after a blaze in the country’s Villaggio Mall killed 19
people, including 13 children in a play area. The results of an
investigation of the mall fire were submitted to the country’s
crown prince yesterday, Al-Sharq said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
