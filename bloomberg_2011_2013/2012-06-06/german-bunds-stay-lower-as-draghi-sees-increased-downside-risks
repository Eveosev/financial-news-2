German bunds pared a decline and
Italian securities dropped after European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said monetary policy can’t make up for a “lack of
action” by other institutions to tackle the debt crisis.  Spanish 10-year  government securities  erased gains after
Draghi said the ECB will extend its offering of unlimited cash
for periods up to three months until the start of 2013, while
indicating longer-term financing will have to wait. The ECB left
its  benchmark interest rate  at 1 percent today, as predicted by
most economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Draghi also said the
region’s economic outlook was subject to “increased downside
risks.”  German 10-year yields rose three basis point, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.24 percent at 2:14 p.m. London time. They
earlier rose as much as seven basis points, the biggest increase
since April 11. The 1.75 percent securities due in July 2022
dropped 0.29, or 2.90 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,246) face amount,
to 104.82.  Spanish 10-year yields were little changed at 6.31 percent,
after earlier falling as much as seven basis points to 6.24
percent. The rate on similar-maturity  Italian debt  was three
basis points higher at 5.68 percent. It dropped as much as six
basis points intraday to touch 5.59 percent.  “I don’t think it would be right for the ECB to fill other
institutions’ lack of action,” Draghi said at a press
conference in  Frankfurt . “We monitor all developments and we
stand ready to act.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
