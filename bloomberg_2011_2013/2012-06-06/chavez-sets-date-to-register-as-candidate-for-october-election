Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez , who
has undergone three operations for cancer in the past year, will
register as his party’s candidate for October’s election on June
11, his election campaign manager said today.  Jorge Rodriguez called on Chavez’s followers to join him
when he registers at the electoral council.  “Next Monday June 11 at 4 p.m. the fatherland and the
revolution will register their candidate,” Jorge Rodriguez said
today in comments carried on state television.  Chavez has refused to reveal a prognosis, the exact
location or type of his cancer, fueling speculation he may not
be fit enough to contest October’s elections. Diosdado Cabello,
vice president of Chavez’s socialist party, added to that
speculation last week when he said a candidate needn’t present
himself in person at the electoral council and instead could
register by Internet.  The opposition alliance’s candidate, Henrique Capriles Radonski, announced plans to organize a march through the
capital, Caracas, on June 10 that will culminate in him
presenting his documents to electoral authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
