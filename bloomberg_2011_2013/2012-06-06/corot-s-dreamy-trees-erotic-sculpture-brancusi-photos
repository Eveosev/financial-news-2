In his paintings and drawings, Jean-
Baptiste-Camille Corot (1796-1875) imbues the landscape, sky and
especially trees with human presence, as if they are actors in
grand dramas.  Trees, which Corot treated as subjects for portraiture,
often upstage the human figures.  Corot rarely painted individuals. Instead, he worked with
archetypes. His trees, like his women, are daydreamers, muses,
goddesses.  In the  Jill Newhouse Gallery ’s small retrospective,
“J.B.C. Corot: Unpublished Drawings,” there’s a charcoal-and-
black-chalk drawing, “A Horseman and Traveler on Foot Nearing
Two Trees” (1874), in which one robust tree hugs or overtakes a
slenderer sapling. The trees are adversaries or lovers --
perhaps both.  In his expressionistic charcoal drawing “The Destruction
of Sodom” (circa 1857), a copy of Corot’s own painting in which
tiny figures flee the burning city, a wispy tree is sole witness
to their flight and plight. Sodom is gone, yet Corot has set the
figures on fire.  Rare Drawings  Surprisingly, this is the first U.S. show devoted to
Corot’s drawings. Most of them have never been exhibited.  The more than 30 works on display span his career, from the
early, crisp, Ingres- and Poussin-esque portraits and landscapes
from his sojourn in  Italy  to the late, somber works closer to
the hand of Claude and Delacroix, even prefiguring Soutine.  Corot’s range of narrative, style and approach is
astonishing. Yet it’s his endlessly inventive handling of every
mood of light -- Corot’s true protagonist -- that makes this
show a must-see.  Prices for the drawings range from $15,000 to $85,000,
while the three paintings in the exhibition are priced between
$170,000 and $700,000. The show is on through July 13 at 4 E.

humorous, sometimes erotic, figurative-based abstract
sculptures.  She cites her training as a dancer for her artworks’
grounding in figuration.  But her sources range from  Leonardo da Vinci ’s notebook
drawings of the forces of nature to stacks of dishes, animals,
architecture, human heads, limbs and internal organs.  Baroque Minimalism  She embraces everything from Bernini’s unfurling Baroque
extravagance to the pared-down Minimalist cube.  The  Betty Cuningham Gallery ’s quirky exhibition spans
Westerlund Roosen’s career from 1976 to 2012.  It comprises roughly three dozen tabletop works, mostly
models and maquettes for larger sculptures. There are also five
recent finished works from the past two years.  They are arranged in intimate groups on low, multilevel
pedestals so that they engage in associative conversation.  “Ariel” (1983) suggests a reclining odalisque, whose
long, scissor legs extend into a bird beak. “Blue Madonna”
(2010) is a whirling dervish, while “Pompadour” (1986) looks
like a disembodied pair of crossed dancer’s legs during a bow.  In “American Beauties” (2011), the artist whimsically
sandwiches two double-sided human breasts -- or flying saucers.  Westerlund Roosen’s larger sculptures can both under- and
overstate their themes. Seen here -- small and en masse -- her
work is as satisfying as it is enigmatic.  Prices range from $6,000 to $30,000. The show runs until
June 29 at 541 W. 25th St.; +1-212-242-2772;

vintage pictures at the  Bruce Silverstein Gallery , makes me wish
that all great artists throughout history had access to the
camera and the inclination to photograph their work.  Looking at the images assembled, all shot and printed by
Brancusi during the period 1917-1936, we are taken on an
otherworldly journey into the artist’s studio practice.  Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957) created not only his
revolutionary sculptures, what he referred to as “essences” of
the world, but also their innovative bases. He also arranged his
works -- the heads, birds, fish, gods and totems -- into
monumental groupings.  At Silverstein, studio shots of finished and unfinished
sculptures, spaces, forms and shadows suggest an Aladdin’s cave
in which Brancusi’s “Birds” gleam like treasure.  Surreal Games  These images instill the studio with ritualistic power. In
views of works such as his “Endless Column,” the carved-wood
sculpture transforms from totem back into strange tree. In
others, the works become pieces navigating surreal game boards.  In one view of the studio, two works become mother and
child. In another, a photo of “Eve & Plato” (c. 1922), one
sculpture looks like an alien contemplating ancient ruins.  In the artist’s masterly photographs of his sculpted heads,
“Sleeping Muse” (c. 1920s) and “Prometheus” (c. 1926-27),
Brancusi moves beyond documentation or even meditation.  He peers into his own work as if into a crystal ball.  Prices range from $50,000 to $250,000. The exhibition runs
through June 23 at 535 W. 24th St.; +1-212-627-3930;
