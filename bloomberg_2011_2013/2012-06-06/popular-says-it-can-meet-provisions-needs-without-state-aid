Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP) , a Spanish
lender whose share price has been cut in half this year, said it
would report a profit this year and next as it uses asset sales
to cover provisions for souring assets.  Popular will target earnings of 325 million euros ($408
million) this year, 580 million euros in 2013 and
“significantly greater” profit in 2014, the Madrid-based
lender said in a business plan filed with regulators today.  Spanish banks including Popular are under orders from the
government to recognize more losses on real estate loans as the
state takeover of the  Bankia (BKIA)  group announced last month
heightens scrutiny of their balance sheets. Popular expects to
earn 2 billion euros by the end of next year in gains from a
joint venture for its consumer credit and cards business and the
sale of its Portuguese life insurance business, bank branches
and property, the bank said.  “Popular rules out any type of public capital injection,”
the bank said.  Separate government decrees in February and May requiring
banks make provisions for real estate oblige Popular to take 7.3
billion euros of charges by the end of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
