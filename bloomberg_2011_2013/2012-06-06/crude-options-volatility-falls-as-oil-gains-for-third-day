Crude-oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose for a third straight day on speculation
that policy makers in  Europe  and the U.S. will act to stimulate
economic growth.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 34.41 percent at 3:10 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 34.44 yesterday.  Volatility has fallen three consecutive days since June 1
when it was 40.56 percent, the highest level since Oct. 20.  “It’s coming in with the rally,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York . “Here we are
at a higher price. We’ve found a temporary floor here.”  Crude oil for July delivery advanced 73 cents to settle at
$85.02 a barrel on the Nymex.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $75 calls, which fell 5 cents to 8 cents a barrel at
3:50 p.m. with 3,086 lots trading. July $77 puts were the
second-most active options with 2,771 lots changing hands as
they declined 10 cents to 15 cents.  Puts accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading volume.
