The ruble had its biggest three-day
gain on record against the dollar as oil rose and the central
bank said it intervened to support the local currency.  The ruble climbed 1.8 percent to 32.42 per dollar by the 7
p.m. close in Moscow, taking its three-day advance to 3.9
percent, the most since at least 2003, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The country’s $2 billion of bonds due 2022 rose,
cutting the yield 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to
4.188 percent.  The central bank sold about $200 million of foreign
currency a day in the past three days to slow the ruble’s
decline, First Deputy Chairman Sergey Ignatiev said in  St.
Petersburg  today.  Brent crude  climbed 2.1 percent to $100.94 per
barrel after the industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute 
said yesterday that inventories fell 1.8 million barrels last
week, a sign demand may rise.  “The central bank is willing to spend more dollars” to
support the ruble, Andrey Kostin, chief executive officer of VTB
Group, Russia’s second-largest lender, said in an interview on
Bloomberg TV. “I am not expecting the ruble to depreciate
further.”  The ruble gained 1.4 percent to 40.585 per euro and 1.6
percent to 36.0942 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket. Investors pared bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing it at 32.9356 per dollar in
three months, compared with expectations of 33.528 per dollar
yesterday.  The yield on Russian Eurobonds due 2015 fell 12 basis
points to 2.306 percent. Similar-maturity dollar-denominated
debt from OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest lender, yielded 11
basis points less than yesterday at 3.868 percent, while the
yield on 2015 Eurobonds issued by state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom
dropped 23 basis points to 3.849 percent.  The cost of insuring Russian Eurobonds against nonpayment
over five years using credit default swaps fell 19 basis points
to 262 basis points, the biggest daily decline since Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
