Polish stocks jumped the most in four
months on speculation European policy makers will act to spur
economic growth.  The WIG20 Index, the stock exchange’s main gauge, surged
2.4 percent to 2,088.26, gaining the most since Jan. 26, as of
4:37 p.m. in Warsaw. Among the biggest gainers were  Bank Pekao
SA (PEO)  and  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , the country’s two largest lenders.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said today
officials stand ready to act as the euro region’s growth outlook
worsens, while damping expectations that another round of three-
year funding for banks is imminent. The ECB is under pressure
from some investors to lower rates and introduce more liquidity
support for banks as governments struggle to fix a crisis that’s
engulfing Spain and could force Greece out of the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
