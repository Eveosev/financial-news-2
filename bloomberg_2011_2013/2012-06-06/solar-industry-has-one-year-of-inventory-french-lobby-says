Makers of solar panels and cells have
inventory representing about a year of sales, meaning that the
industry will see further bankruptcies and consolidation, the
head of  France ’s Renewable Energy Association said.  Production capacity in the photovoltaic industry is “about
double the estimated market size, and inventories represent
about one year of sales,” Jean-Louis Bal, the president of the
lobby group, said today at a conference organized by L’Usine
Nouvelle magazine in Paris. “There are a lot of manufacturers,
including large Chinese players, which are in financial
difficulties. There will be restructuring.”  Global demand for solar panels may climb to 32 gigawatts
this year from 27 gigawatts in 2011, he said.  The  Bloomberg Large Solar Energy (BISOLAR)  index of 17 companies has
dropped 75 percent in the past 12 months as Chinese price
competition, excess production capacity, and dwindling subsidies
from cash-strapped European governments have hurt the share
prices of many solar-equipment suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
