President  Dennis Lockhart  said a fragile recovery shown by the
weak jobs report last week could require additional stimulus if
it becomes clear growth is slowing.  Current policy is “appropriate” for now, Lockhart said in
a speech in  Fort Lauderdale , Florida. “Should it become clear
that something resembling my baseline scenario of continued,
though modest, growth is no longer realistic, further monetary
actions to support the recovery will certainly need to be
considered.”  The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets June
19-20 to consider whether more stimulus is warranted amid signs
the  U.S. economy  is slowing. Employers in May added the fewest
workers in a year, and the  unemployment rate  rose to 8.2
percent, Labor Department figures showed June 1.  “As the employment report of last Friday illustrates,
there continues to be a halting and tenuous character to the
recovery,” Lockhart said to the Broward Workshop, a local
business group.  Fed officials will update their forecasts for growth,
unemployment and inflation. Policy makers favoring more stimulus
include Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren , who said on May 31
the central bank should cut joblessness by prolonging beyond
this month a program that lengthens the average duration of
bonds on its balance sheet.  High Threshold  Lockhart has told reporters after prior speeches this year
the threshold for more action is “high,” including “a serious
deterioration in the economy” or threat of falling prices.  Today’s speech emphasized continued risks, including those
from the U.S. fiscal policy debate and from the European debt
crisis, which has the potential for “spillover” to the U.S.
financial system.  “The situation we face requires that the FOMC maintain a
state of readiness to respond to financial or economic
instability should the need arise,” Lockhart said. “I am
confident that the committee retains the capacity to act and the
tools to promote stability.”  The Atlanta Fed president called recent economic data
“underwhelming.”  “It is nearly impossible to escape the conclusion that we
are replaying in some manner the spring-summer slowdowns of the
past two years,” he said. “The economy remains in recovery
but, as the disappointing employment numbers illustrate, the
economy is working against some strong headwinds.”  Additional Action  Several Federal Reserve policy makers said a loss of
momentum in growth or increased risks to their economic outlook
could warrant additional action to keep the recovery going,
minutes of their last meeting showed. The policy-making  Federal
Open Market Committee  on April 25 reiterated its expectation
that subdued inflation and economic slack will probably warrant
“exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least
through late 2014.”  Lockhart, 65, a former Georgetown University professor, has
led the Atlanta Fed since 2007. Fed presidents rotate voting on
monetary policy, with Lockhart voting this year. The Atlanta Fed
district includes  Alabama , Florida,  Georgia , and portions of
Louisiana,  Mississippi , and  Tennessee .  To contact the reporters on this story:
