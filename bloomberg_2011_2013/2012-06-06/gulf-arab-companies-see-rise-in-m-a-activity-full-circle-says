Companies in the  Persian Gulf  expect
to initiate more mergers and acquisitions this year as a way of
expanding, according to a Full Circle Investments survey of
chief executive officers and company owners.  M&A is the second most cited restructuring that CEO and
business owners plan to initiate in the next 12 months, after
controlling costs, according to the survey that covers 150
companies in  Saudi Arabia (SABIC) , the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain,
Qatar, Kuwait and Oman.  In the past 12 months, M&A ranked as the fourth-most
initiated activity after costs, establishing strategic alliances
and divestments, the survey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
