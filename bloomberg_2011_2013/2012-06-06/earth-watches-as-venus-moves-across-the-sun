Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker reports 
on a once in a lifetime sight, the transit of Venus, as the 
planet moves between the earth and the sun. The rare event is 
next scheduled for 2117 and has happened only 8 times since the 
invention of the telescope. He speaks on Bloomberg Television's 
"Inside Track." (Source: Bloomberg)  Running Time: 00:40
