Workers at Belmont Park and the  New
York Racing Association  reached a tentative contract agreement
that ensures the Belmont Stakes and I’ll Have Another’s run for
the Triple Crown won’t be threatened by a strike,  New York 
Governor  Andrew Cuomo  announced today.  The agreement between the NYRA and Local 3 of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers satisfies all
major economic issues that had stalled negotiations, including
shift schedules and benefits, Cuomo said in an e-mailed
statement. Leadership from both the union and the racing
association that operates the track expressed satisfaction with
the agreement in the statement.  Workers at Belmont Park had been without a contract since
February 2011. Two weeks ago, members voted to give the union
authority to go on strike prior to the June 9 race if no deal
was reached, and a mediator was brought in yesterday, according
to the New York Daily News.  I’ll Have Another was installed today as the 4-5 favorite
for the Belmont Stakes. He won last month’s  Kentucky Derby  and
the Preakness, the first two legs of the Triple Crown, and would
become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to sweep the
series with a win this weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
