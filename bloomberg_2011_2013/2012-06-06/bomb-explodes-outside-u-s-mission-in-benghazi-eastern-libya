A bomb exploded outside the gate of
the U.S. mission in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, causing
no casualties, a U.S. Embassy official said in a phone
interview.  The explosion occurred late yesterday, according to the
official, who declined to be identified in line with embassy
policy in the country. The official said the U.S. has tightened
security around all its offices in  Libya  and is working with
Libyan authorities to investigate the attack.  Libya’s interim leaders have struggled to stabilize the
North African nation following last year’s bloody uprising that
ended with Muammar Qaddafi’s ouster and death. Militias and
other armed groups still operate freely, even as the national
military is trying to assert greater control in the run-up to
parliamentary elections scheduled for June 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
