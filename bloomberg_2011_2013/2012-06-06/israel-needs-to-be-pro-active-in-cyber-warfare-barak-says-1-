Israel needs to be “pro-active” in
cyber-warfare, moving from a defensive posture to a
comprehensive security approach, Israeli Defense Minister  Ehud Barak  said.  The government will establish a “war room” to implement
that approach and assess threats and strategy during major
attacks, said Evyatar Matanya, head of the new National Cyber
Directorate. The two officials spoke today at a conference on
cyber-security at Tel Aviv University.  “We need to switch to a proactive system, in which we
don’t just react to attacks,” Barak said, comparing the
development of destructive software to the introduction of the
army tank.  Iran  accused Israel of creating the Stuxnet computer worm
last year to sabotage its nuclear facilities. Israeli officials
have declined to confirm or deny the country was involved in the
cyber-attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
