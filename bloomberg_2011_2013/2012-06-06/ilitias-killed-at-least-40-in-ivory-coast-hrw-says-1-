At least 40 people have been killed
in western  Ivory Coast  since July 2011 in cross-border attacks
by Liberia-based armed groups loyal to former president  Laurent Gbagbo , Human Rights Watch said.  There were at least four attacks targeting civilians from
ethnic groups said to support Ivory Coast President  Alassane Ouattara , the New-York based non-governmental organization said
in an e-mailed report today.  The armed groups, which mainly comprise Ivorians and
Liberians who fought for Gbagbo during last year’s post-election
crisis in the West African country, recruited child soldiers as
young as 14, the human rights group said. The assailants told
Human Rights Watch they are preparing more attacks.  At least 3,000 people were killed last year in Ivory Coast
during a five-month crisis caused by Gbagbo’s refusal to hand
over power after he lost a November 2010 vote.  Thousands of mercenaries from Liberia fought with militias
and forces loyal to Gbagbo. Many of them fled to neighboring
Liberia after he was arrested in April last year,  Human Rights
Watch  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
