KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
run by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , is cutting costs at its
European portfolio companies to prepare for an economic slowdown
as the debt crisis worsens, said the firm’s head of global
capital.  “We’ve been bracing ourselves for companies to see a big
pullback, so we’ve been taking out costs,” Scott Nuttall said
today at the Keefe Bruyette & Woods Asset Management Conference
in New York. “We’ve been trying to get as lean as we can.”  The crisis in Europe has hurt the value of companies owned
by private-equity firms, and deal activity on the continent has
been “relatively slow” as valuations fall and uncertainty
rises, Nuttall said in April. Providence Equity Partners Inc.,
the buyout firm whose holdings include Univision Communications
Inc., the cable-television network of the  New York Yankees , said
investing in Europe is not worth the risk right now.  “Values don’t line up with risk and expected growth
rates,” Jonathan Nelson, Providence’s chief executive officer
and co-founder, said today at the SuperReturn conference in
Boston.  Nuttall said KKR’s European companies are weathering the
European turmoil better than expected because many of them have
exports beyond the continent, including to Asian consumer
markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
