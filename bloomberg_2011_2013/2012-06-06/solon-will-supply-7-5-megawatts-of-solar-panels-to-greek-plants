Solon Energy GmbH, a German solar-
panel maker, will supply 7.5 megawatts of modules to power
plants in  Greece .  Solon signed a contract with developer Arxikon to deliver
about 30,000 modules produced in Germany for plants in northern
Greece, the company said today in a  statement  on its website.  “The Greek photovoltaic market is growing despite the
difficult economic situation there,” Stefan Saeuberlich, chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
