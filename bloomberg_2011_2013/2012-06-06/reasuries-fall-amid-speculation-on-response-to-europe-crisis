U.S. 30-year bond  yields  climbed the
most in two months after European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said his policy makers are “ready to act,” adding to
bets the world’s leading economies may collaborate on a response
to Europe’s crisis and signs of slower economic growth.  Treasuries dropped for a third day even after the ECB kept
 interest rates  unchanged and a report showed U.S. productivity
slowed more than first estimated. Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said extending Operation
Twist, the program to lengthen maturities of debt on the central
bank’s balance sheet, remains an option.  “It’s a pretty good risk-on day,” said Ira Jersey, an
interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York,
one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “There
is optimism that there may be some announcement this weekend out
of Europe. That’s driving some of the risk-on moves.”  Yields on  30-year bonds  increased 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 2.74 percent at 5:01 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They rose as much as
11 basis points, the most since April 3. The price of the 3
percent security due in May 2042 slid 2 1/32, or $20.31 per
$1,000 face amount, to 105 10/32. The benchmark  10-year note
yield  added nine basis points to 1.66 percent and touched 1.67
percent, the highest level in a week.  Volume Climbs  Trading  volume  climbed 41 percent. About $340 billion of
Treasuries changed hands through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
interdealer broker, compared with $242 billion yesterday. The
average volume over the past year was $257 billion.  Stocks and commodities rallied as investor risk appetite
swelled. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index surged 2.3 percent, and
the S&P GSCI Index of raw materials gained 1.3 percent.  Treasuries had their best performance last month since
August amid  Europe ’s debt crisis and concern U.S. economic
growth was slowing. They returned 1.8 percent, according to
indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Ten- and 30-year yields reached record lows of 1.4387
percent and 2.5089 percent on June 1 after the Labor Department
reported the economy added 69,000 jobs in May, less than half
the number projected by a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
The yields reached their 2012 highs in March, 3.49 percent for
long bonds and 2.40 percent for 10-years.  Less Expensive  Valuation measures showed Treasuries were the cheapest
today in more than a week. The term premium, a model created by
economists at the Fed, was negative 0.80 percent, the least
expensive since May 29. A negative reading shows investors are
willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The
gauge closed June 1 at negative 0.94 percent, the most expensive
on record. The one-year average is negative 0.44 percent.  The yield difference between 10- and 30-year Treasuries
securities widened to 108 basis points today, after touching 103
basis points yesterday, the narrowest since Jan. 12. The average
over the past year was 115 basis points.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, or  break-even rate , a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, increased to as much as 2.19 percentage points, the widest
on an intraday basis since May 23. It touched 2.01 percentage
points on May 30, the least since January, after rising to 2.45
on March 20.  With European governments struggling to fix a debt crisis
that’s engulfing  Spain  and may prompt  Greece  to exit the euro,
pressure has mounted on the ECB to introduce more liquidity
support for banks. The bank held its benchmark  interest rate 
steady today at 1 percent. Policy makers will “monitor all
developments closely, and we stand ready to act,” Draghi said
in  Frankfurt  after the rate meeting.  ‘Collective Probability’  “Sometimes markets gather steam and express a collective
probability of an outcome and, by the time the outcome is
explicitly communicated, the market is already at that level,”
said Russ Certo, managing director of rates trading at Gleacher
& Co. in New York. “It’s kind of like buy the rumor, sell the
fact.”  Lockhart of the Atlanta Fed said the central bank “has the
capacity to do more” with Operation Twist, which is set to
expire at the end of this month. He spoke in response to
audience questions at an event in  Fort Lauderdale ,  Florida .  In the program, the Fed is replacing $400 billion of
shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with longer maturities
by the end of this month to keeping borrowing costs down. The
central bank bought $1.7 billion today of Treasuries due from
February 2036 to August 2041 as part of the effort.  ‘Optimism, Hope’  “We’re seeing a global slowdown and there’s optimism, hope
that central banks are going to act in a concerted way to
address this,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in New
York of government and agency debt trading at R.W. Pressprich &
Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer for institutional
investors.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will testify tomorrow to the
Joint Economic Committee on the U.S. economic outlook as policy
makers prepare to open a two-day meeting on June 19. The central
bank has kept its benchmark  interest rate  at zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008 and bought $2.3 trillion of debt in
two rounds of quantitative easing from December 2008 to June
2011 to spur economic growth.  Yields on 10-year notes climbed earlier after Fed regional
bank presidents voiced opposing views yesterday over whether the
central bank should step up record accommodation following the
lowest monthly increase in U.S. payrolls in a year.  Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans  said in a speech in New
York that “soft” U.S. economic data call for “extremely
strong accommodation,” while  Richard Fisher  of  Dallas  said more
bond purchases to spur growth would be “pushing on a string.”  ‘Sufficient Progress’  After policy makers met in April, Bernanke said the Fed may
ease further should unemployment fail to make “sufficient
progress towards its longer-run normal level.”  Unemployment in May rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent
the prior month, and the addition of 69,000 jobs compared with
275,000 in January.  The Labor Department’s measure of  employee output  per hour
decreased at a 0.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter,
after a 1.2 percent gain in the prior three months, revised
figures showed today in  Washington . Expenses per worker rose at
a 1.3 percent rate and output grew 2.4 percent, less than
previously estimated.  Treasuries remained lower after the Fed said in its Beige
Book business survey the  U.S. economy  maintained a moderate pace
of growth from early April to late May as factory output
increased and the real-estate market improved.  To contact the reporters on this story:
