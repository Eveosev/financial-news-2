JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s trading loss
of more than $2 billion shows “that no institution is immune
from bad judgment,” U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman  Tim
Johnson  said in remarks prepared for a Washington hearing.   The losses disclosed last month by New York-based JPMorgan,
the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank, shows the need for
reforms included in the Dodd-Frank Act, said Johnson, who is
leading a hearing today on the 2010 regulatory overhaul.
Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, criticized what he said were
efforts by banks and Republican lawmakers to undermine the law.  “To repeal or weaken Wall Street Reform, and defund the
cops enforcing it, would take us back to the days before the
financial crisis of 2008,” Johnson said in his statement for
the hearing, which will include testimony from representatives
of the  Federal Reserve , Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and Treasury Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
