Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s largest
seed company, will repurchase as much as $1 billion of shares as
rising profit boosts the company’s cash horde to a record.  The buyback program is authorized for a three-year period
beginning July 1, St. Louis-based Monsanto said today in a
statement. The repurchases will begin with the completion of an
earlier $1 billion buyback that began last July, Monsanto said.
The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 30 cents a
share payable July 27, unchanged from an April payment.  Profit in the three months through May is expected to rise
to $1.57 to $1.62 a share, topping analyst  estimates , as farmers
in the U.S.,  Latin America  and Eastern Europe bought more
genetically modified crop seeds, Monsanto said May 30. Monsanto
had a record $3.12 billion of  cash  and near cash items as of
Feb. 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The positive business results we’ve achieved to date in
2012 are translating earnings into cash, which creates the
opportunity to reinvest in our business for growth and also
enables us to return value to shareowners,” Chief Financial
Officer Pierre Courduroux said in the statement.  Monsanto rose 2.1 percent to $78.49 at 9:57 a.m. in  New
York . The shares have climbed 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
