We learned  last week  that  India 's economic growth in the quarter from January to March was 5.3 percent, the slowest in 36 quarters, though not bad by world standards. The news may signal the end of growth rates between 6 percent and 9 percent that have radically refashioned the consumer landscape of the country in the two decades  since the liberalization of the economy in 1991  and have lifted a few hundred million people out of poverty. Growth was never this slow, even during the  world financial crisis of 2008 . The news, while dispiriting,  wasn't especially surprising . Analysts of the Indian economy were quick to point out that the slowdown wasn't so much the result of global economic conditions, such as economic trouble in  Europe , as it was a consequence of poor economic management by the governing United Progressive Alliance coalition. Since returning to power in 2009, that government has set back the country with a combination of fiscal populism and policy paralysis, with some big corruption scandals thrown in for good measure. A particularly revealing instance of the government's inability to take a clear line on policy occurred late last year when it cleared a long-awaited  move to open up the country to foreign investment  in the retail sector, a change that would have given the economy a large booster shot of investment, some of it in much-needed infrastructure such as an improved cold chain for Indian agriculture. That decision was  rescinded  when opposition out around the country. Something similar happened earlier this year, when Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi  lost his job  after raising passenger fares in his budget. As an American who used to have interests in India said to me in  Washington  last week, what businesses dislike even more than high taxes or stringent  labor laws  is an unstable policy environment, as this makes it impossible to formulate long-term plans and projections. He cited an example from March, when the government proposed the alarming idea of  imposing retrospective taxes  on foreign companies in India. Meanwhile, too much new Indian capitalism, he suggested, tended to be of the  crony kind , which meant that entrepreneurial energy was being directed less toward economic innovation than to cultivating connections and paying bribes. Capitalists were being trained not in learning how to play by the rules, but in how to set up special rules for themselves. The present government has often mumbled, when criticized, about "the compulsions of coalition politics" and "the need to carry everyone along in a democracy." Yet it hasn't seemed to understand that its job isn't just to work out a clear direction for policy, especially economic liberalization, but also to create an intellectual climate for such moves, which are hardly unambiguous and need to be set in a frame that emphasizes the complex trade-offs involved. One wouldn't know from the events of the past year that the government is led by an accomplished economist, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh . It doesn't help either that the next general elections aren't until 2014 and that Singh's heir-in-waiting, should the UPA return to power, is  Rahul Gandhi , the scion of the Gandhi dynasty and a politician who has never provided a clear statement of his views on economic issues. In an editorial titled " Oh, What a Lovely Mess! " the business newspaper Mint said: And in a piece in The Economist, " A BRIC Hits The Wall ," said: In the Financial Times, James Crabtree remarked that "as Indiaâ€™s growth slumps, delegations of aggrieved business titans are becoming an increasingly common sight in  New Delhi ." But he saw something positive in the slowdown, pointing out in " Bollygarchs at Bay ": Indeed, there is one sector of the economy that is still reliably growing at double-digit figures: the asset base of the Indian political class, as declared by politicians themselves. The journalist P. Sainath reported on some of these stories last year in a great piece called " The Union Cabinet Gets Healthier ." And a most interesting paper published in the Economic and Political Weekly last month, " Unravelling the Anatomy of Legal Corruption ," demonstrated that both winning and losing candidates in elections reliably beat the market over a period of time in the growth of their assets, and that the weighted average market growth rate for the winners of the 2004 general election was 97 percent, and it was 164 percent for the state election. Small-time retail investors (such as myself) who have got no joy from the Indian stock market recently -- the  BSE India Sensitive Index  has lost more than 10 percent in the last year -- await the introduction of a mutual fund that invests purely in politicians, thereby allowing investors to tap the trickledown effect that critics of the Indian economic story say is still missing. Some good material for satire there. Still, what's happening on the ground in India is no joke. (Chandrahas Choudhury, a novelist, is the New Delhi correspondent for World View.
