Kenya reopened its main airport in
the capital, Nairobi, after removing an EgyptAir aircraft that
veered off the runway and blocked other planes from taking off
and landing, the Kenya Airports Authority said.  “All flights are back to normal,” Dominic Ngigi, a
spokesman for the authority, said today in a phone interview.  EgyptAir Flight 849 left the runway shortly after landing
at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at 3:36 a.m. and its nose
wheel got stuck in mud to the side of the tarmac, Ngigi said.
The airport was closed because a wing of the aircraft was
protruding onto the runway, he said. All 123 passengers aboard
the flight bound from Cairo were evacuated unharmed, KAA said in
an e-mailed statement.  JKIA is East and Central Africa’s busiest airport, handling
5.5 million passengers a year and an average of more than 7,000
flights a month, according to the aviation authority’s website.
The airport’s sole runway was built in 1958.  Kenya Airways Ltd., (KNAL)  sub-Saharan Africa’s third-biggest
carrier, said earlier it diverted seven incoming flights to Moi
International Airport in the port city of  Mombasa ; four to
Entebbe International Airport in  Uganda ; and one to Julius
Nyerere International Airport in  Dar es Salaam , Tanzania.  EgyptAir is investigating the cause of the accident, the
Cairo-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
