More than $200 trillion in notional
value of interest-rate and credit-default swaps have been
eliminated from the over-the-counter  derivatives market  by
canceling offsetting trades, the International Swaps &
Derivatives Association said.  So-called tear-up agreements are used to get rid of
redundant trades in the privately negotiated market and help
lower credit risk by paring the number of transactions that must
be accounted for on a daily basis. Rate swaps have been reduced
by $120 trillion and credit swaps by $82 trillion as of the end
of 2011, ISDA said in an e-mailed statement today.  The trade and lobbying group for users of OTC derivatives
said on an adjusted basis  interest-rate swaps  total $262
trillion. The adjusted figure eliminates double-counting of
trades that have been processed by clearinghouses, ISDA said.
More than 53 percent of rate swaps had been backed by a
clearinghouse as of Dec. 31, while 10.6 percent of credit swaps
have been cleared, the group said.  “The increase in central clearing, the effectiveness of
netting and collateral, and portfolio compression all work
toward the same goal -- reducing counterparty credit risk,”
 Robert Pickel , chief executive officer of ISDA, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
