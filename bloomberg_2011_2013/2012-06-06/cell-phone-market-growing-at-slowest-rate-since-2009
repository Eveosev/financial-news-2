Worldwide mobile-phone shipments will
grow about 4 percent this year, the slowest rate since 2009,
hurt by the sluggish economy and a decline in so-called feature
phones, research firm IDC said.  Feature phones, the basic models that lack the Internet
functions of smartphones, will drop 10 percent, IDC said today
in a report. Still, the devices will make up almost 62 percent
of the total market, the company said.  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system will remain the top
smartphone software this year, with 61 percent of the market,
IDC predicted. Apple Inc.’s iOS will rank second with 20.5
percent, followed by  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) ’s BlackBerry at 6
percent and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows Phone at 5.2 percent.  IDC projects Android will maintain its lead in the next
four years, though it won’t be as dominant. The software will
have almost 53 percent of the market in 2016, the research firm
predicts. Windows Mobile and iOS will each have about 19
percent.  “What remains to be seen is how these different
operating systems -- as well as others -- will define and shape
the user experience beyond what we see today in order to attract
new customers and encourage replacements,” Ramon Llamas, an
analyst at the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company, said in
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
