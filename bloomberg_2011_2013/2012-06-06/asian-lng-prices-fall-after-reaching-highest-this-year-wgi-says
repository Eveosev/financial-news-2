Spot liquefied natural gas prices for
Northeast Asia fell this week after reaching the highest this
year in May, World Gas Intelligence reported.  Prices for cargoes delivered in the next four to eight
weeks declined 20 cents to $18.20 a million British thermal
units, according to WGI’s own assessment of the market made on
June 1 and published today.  Rising supply after maintenance at LNG production plants
and the completion of recent procurement programs by Asian
utilities damped prices from $18.40 a million Btu last week, the
highest this year, according to WGI.  Demand for the chilled fuel in  Japan , the world’s biggest
LNG user, rose to a record after the earthquake and tsunami last
year led to the closure of all the country’s nuclear power
stations, boosting other fuels for power generation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
