Jamaica’s government plans to impose
taxes on more goods such as phone calls in order to reduce the
Caribbean nation’s debt, Finance Minister Peter Phillips told
lawmakers.  “We are forced to consider every possible means of
revenue,” Philips said in a speech to Parliament today. “In
such a crisis as the one we presently face, things that we might
never have considered as being taxable, had to be considered.”  The new taxes will boost government revenue by 8.2 percent
this year and help restore a “trust deficit” with
international lenders after Jamaica’s debt level almost doubled
over the past four years, Phillips said.  The country’s debt amounted to 126 percent of gross
domestic product in 2011, behind only Antigua & Barbuda and St.
Kitts & Nevis in the Caribbean, and compared with  Greece ’s 165
percent, according to the  International Monetary Fund . The $13
billion economy, expected to grow 1 percent this year, risks a
“fragile” recovery unless the government can reduce debt, the
IMF said in March.  The government hopes to reach an accord with the IMF by the
end of the year after a $1.27 billion stand-by credit agreement
fell apart in 2011, costing Jamaica access to $306 million in
loans, Phillips told lawmakers today.  Exemptions will be made to protect the poor against the new
tax measures, such as not taxing text books approved by the
Ministry of Education, Phillips said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
