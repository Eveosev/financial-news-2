Noor Islamic Bank, a lender
controlled by Dubai’s government, said it’s seeking business in
 Singapore  and Malaysia as it aims to benefit from growth in
 Southeast Asia .  “I’ll be interested in any transaction that comes up,”
Hussain Al Qemzi, chief executive officer of the United Arab
Emirates-based lender, said in an interview in Singapore today.
“Malaysia is the world’s biggest sukuk market. I understand
companies are looking to finance infrastructure projects.”  Malaysia, which is aiming to become a global hub for
 Islamic finance , has a $444 billion program to build roads and
power plants over the next 10 years. Sukuk, or Islamic bonds,
pay asset returns to comply with the religion’s ban on interest.  Al Qemzi said yesterday at the World Islamic Banking
Conference in Singapore that the European debt crisis offered
Islamic lenders a “golden opportunity” to capture a bigger
share of the world banking market.  Noor Islamic helped clients raise $2.1 billion of
syndicated loans in  Turkey  in the past 18 months and it plans
similar ventures in Southeast Asia, he said.  “We will be interested in helping Southeast Asian clients
with Shariah-compliant business in the  Middle East ,” Al Qemzi
said.  Malaysian companies have sold 15 billion ringgit ($4.7
billion) of Islamic bonds in 2012, 8 percent more than the same
period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Assets of Shariah-compliant banks are expected to reach $1.1
trillion this year from $826 billion in 2010, according to an
estimate published by Ernst & Young.  To contact the reporters on this story:
