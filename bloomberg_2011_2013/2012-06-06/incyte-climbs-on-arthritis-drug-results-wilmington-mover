Incyte Corp. (INCY) , a maker of cancer and
autoimmune drugs, climbed for a second trading day after a study
showed improvement for patients on the experimental rheumatoid
arthritis treatment it’s developing with  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)   Incyte rose 6.8 percent to $23.21 at the close of New York
 trading , the day after data were released at the European League
Against Rheumatism’s  annual meeting  in Berlin. The shares gained
4.4 percent yesterday. The drug from the Wilmington, Delaware-
based company reduced symptoms for 76 percent of patients in one
group compared to 41 percent on a placebo, researchers said.  The once-a-day pill, originally named INCB028050, faces
competition from tofacitinib, the rheumatoid arthritis treatment
being developed by New York-based  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s
largest drugmaker. The study found “no major safety surprises”
and bodes well for Incyte, said  Brian Abrahams , a Wells Fargo
Securities analyst in New York.  “The results confirm ‘050’s potential to be a very
competitive oral” treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, Abrahams
said in a note to clients. “We could see some initial share
upside from these strong confirmatory results.”  The  study  came in the second of three phases normally
required for drugs to win U.S. regulatory approval. Incyte said
in December 2009 that it would partner with Indianapolis-based
Lilly on the development and sale of the drug, which was renamed
LY3009104.  Incyte shares have risen 37 percent over the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
