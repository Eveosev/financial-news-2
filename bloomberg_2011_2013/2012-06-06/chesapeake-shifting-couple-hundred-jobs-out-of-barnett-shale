Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  will shift a
“couple hundred” jobs out of Fort Worth, Texas, as drilling in
the Barnett shale formation slows.  Chesapeake’s contractor force will be reduced, and no Fort
Worth layoffs have been announced, Michael Kehs, a spokesman for
Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake said in a telephone interview.
Jobs will be shifted to formations that produce more petroleum
liquids.  “We are committed to our people and doing everything we
can to find a place within the company where they can put their
skills to use,” Kehs said.  Gas for next-month delivery fell 0.1 percent to $2.421 a
million British thermal units today in New York. At that price,
it’s six times cheaper than oil on an energy-equivalent basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
