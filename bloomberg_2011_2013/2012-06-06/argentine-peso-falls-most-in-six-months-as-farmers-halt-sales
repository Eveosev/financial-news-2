Argentina ’s peso fell the most in six
months as the nation’s farmers halted sales of grains and
livestock in opposition to a tax increase on rural property in
 Buenos Aires .  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 4.4915 pesos per dollar at 2
p.m. in  New York , the biggest decline since Nov. 29. The
currency has dropped 1.4 percent in the past 30 days, the
sharpest monthly slide since March 2009.  The central bank is allowing the pace of the peso’s
controlled slide to quicken as the farmer protests curb the
inflow of dollars into the world’s second-largest corn exporter.
The strike, slated to halt sales from today through June 12,
adds to pressure on the peso after the government’s tightening
of currency purchase restrictions heightened capital flight from
Argentines seeking to protect their money from annual inflation
that economists say tops 20 percent.  “There’s a market pressure to devalue more,” said
Fernando Izzo, a currency trader with ABC Mercado de Cambio in
Buenos Aires. “The volume in the  currency market  has dropped
because there are fewer dollars and the farmers are selling
less, so the central bank is letting it weaken.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
