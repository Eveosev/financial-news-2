Industrial Development Corp., a South
African state lender, is in talks with potential partners on
proposals to build a steel plant to compete with  ArcelorMittal
South Africa Ltd. (ACL)  and  Evraz Highveld Steel and Vanadium Ltd.   The project would have capacity of 2.5 million metric tons
a year and use technology to cut output costs, Dave Cousins, the
IDC executive for mining and beneficiation, told a  Cape Town 
conference without naming the parties involved in the talks.  Most South African steel is produced using blast furnaces
requiring imported hard coking coal and high-grade iron ore. The
IDC has studied other technology, as prices for coking coal have
outstripped those for steel, and will focus on low-cost output
to meet an expected tripling in demand by 2020, Cousins said.  The IDC studied titanium blast furnaces and rotary hearth
furnaces, both able to use lower-grade  iron ore  and locally
produced coal, he said, without stating which is preferred.  “We have a solution, and we are engaging with partners,”
Cousins said. “There is room for additional steel capacity.”  The IDC estimates South African capacity of 9.3 million
tons a year compared with consumption of 5.4 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
