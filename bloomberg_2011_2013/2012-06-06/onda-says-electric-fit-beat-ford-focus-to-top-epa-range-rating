Honda Motor Co. (7267)  said U.S. government
tests of its electric Fit hatchback show the car’s battery range
exceeds that of competing rechargeable models including  Nissan
Motor Co. (7201) ’s Leaf and  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s electric Focus small car.  The  2013 Fit EV , available only in  California  and  Oregon 
this year, averages 82 miles (132 kilometers) per charge of its
lithium-ion battery pack in combined city and highway driving in
Environmental Protection Agency test results, Honda said in an
e-mailed statement. The EPA rates the Leaf as averaging 73 miles
per charge, lower than the Focus’s 76 miles and higher than the
62 miles for  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) ’s i-MiEV.  The Fit, whose availability will be expanded to other U.S.
regions in 2013, is also faster in recharging than competing
models as the small hatchback needs only three hours to get a
full charge from a 240-volt electric outlet, Tokyo-based Honda
said.  Automakers are adding electric and plug-in hybrid autos to
their U.S. lineups to meet demand for vehicles that use little
or no gasoline and to comply with rules in California. Honda,
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Nissan, Ford,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and
Chrysler Group LLC have to sell a total of about 60,000 such
vehicles from this model year through 2014, and more than a 1
million annually by 2025.  The Fit EV is currently available only as a leased model,
with customers required to pay $389 a month, the company said in
April. The annual cost of electricity to refuel the car should
be about $500, Honda said in the statement.  Honda’s U.S. headquarters are in Torrance, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
