Yuan  forwards gained the most in more
than four months after official data showed U.S. services output
grew faster than expected, damping concern a recovery in the
world’s largest economy is losing steam.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  fell 0.44 percent today as The Institute
for Supply Management’s  index  of non-manufacturing businesses,
which covers about 90 percent of the U.S. economy, rose to 53.7
last month from April’s 53.5, beating the median forecast of
53.4 in a Bloomberg survey. Readings above 50 signal expansion.
The People’s Bank of China should cut  interest rates  at an
appropriate time to boost confidence in the economy, according
to a commentary on the front page of the state-run China
Securities Journal today.  “The U.S. data helped improve market sentiment,” said
Ronald Wan, managing director at China Merchants Securities in
Hong Kong. “China is likely to seek a stable  exchange rate 
until the export outlook gets brighter.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.3 percent,
the most since Jan. 26, to 6.4180 per dollar as of 4:47 p.m. in
 Hong Kong , a 0.8 percent discount to the onshore spot rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan strengthened 0.06 percent to close at 6.3635 per
dollar in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.1415 percent. In Hong
Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.06 percent to 6.3635.  The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate 0.06
percent weaker at 6.3261, lowering it for the first time in four
days. The fixing is 0.65 percent stronger than yesterday’s
closing spot price. The currency is allowed to trade as much as
1 percent either side of the  reference rate .  To contact the reporter on this story:
