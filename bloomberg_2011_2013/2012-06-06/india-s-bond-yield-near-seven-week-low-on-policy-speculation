India’s benchmark bond yields were
near the lowest level in seven weeks on speculation a slowing
economy and sliding  oil prices  will spur the central bank to cut
borrowing costs.  Gross domestic product  rose  5.3 percent in the first
quarter, the least in nine years, according to government data
published last week.  Brent crude , the benchmark for most of the
nation’s oil imports, traded at $99.37 per barrel after sliding
below $100 for the first time since October last week. The
 Reserve Bank  of India has room to cut  interest rates , Deputy
Governor Subir Gokarn said on June 4.  “A rate cut now looks highly likely to support growth,”
said Vivek Rajpal, a Mumbai-based fixed-income strategist at
Nomura Holdings Inc. “Lower oil prices should also give some
comfort on the inflation front.”  The yield on the government’s 8.79 percent bonds due
November 2021 was little changed at 8.35 percent as of 9:38 a.m.
in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. It
touched 8.34 percent yesterday, the lowest level since April 17.  Rajpal predicts the central bank will cut the repurchase
rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent at this month’s policy
review on June 18. The monetary authority last cut the
repurchase  rate  by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April after
raising borrowing costs 13 times between March 2010 and October
2011.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose three basis
points to 7.66 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
