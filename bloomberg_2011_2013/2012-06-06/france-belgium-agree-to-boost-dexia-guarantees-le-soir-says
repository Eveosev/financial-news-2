France and Belgium have agreed to
increase the temporary state guarantees for crisis-hit lender
 Dexia SA (DEXB)  by an additional 10 billion euros ($12.5 billion),  Le
Soir  reported, without citing the source of its information.  French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  and his Belgian
counterpart Steven Vanackere reached a deal earlier this week to
raise the ceiling of the guarantees to 55 billion euros from 45
billion euros, the newspaper said.  The governments must notify this additional 10 billion
euros in aid to the European Commission, Le Soir said. The
commission, the 27-nation European Union’s executive arm, will
assess whether these extra guarantees comply with the bloc’s
rules on state support to companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
