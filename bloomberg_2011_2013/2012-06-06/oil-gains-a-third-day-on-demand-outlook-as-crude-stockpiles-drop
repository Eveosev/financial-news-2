Oil rose for a third day in New York
on shrinking stockpiles and signs of economic improvement in the
U.S., the world’s largest consumer of crude.  West Texas Intermediate futures gained as much as 1.6
percent, while Brent oil in London surpassed $100 a barrel for
the first time since June 1. U.S. crude inventories fell  1.8
million barrels  last week to 384.1 million barrels, the
industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  said yesterday. An
Energy Department report today may show supplies slid by 500,000
barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Bank of America
Corp. cut price forecasts for the year’s second half and 2013.  “The U.S. recovery is a bright star in a dim firmament,”
said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd.
in London. “But there is no reason for prices to hold here, and
the market may well turn lower again.”  Oil for July delivery climbed as much as $1.38 to $85.67 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $85.31 at 1:33 p.m. London time. The contract
yesterday rose 0.4 percent to $84.29, the highest close since
May 31. Prices are 14 percent lower this year.  Brent oil for July settlement gained as much as $1.77, or
1.8 percent, to $100.61 and was at $100.20 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract’s  premium  to WTI was at $14.89, compared with $14.55
yesterday.  Relative Strength  New York  crude is set to rebound based on a technical
indicator that shows a decline of more than 20 percent from this
year’s high into bear market conditions is the most-exaggerated
drop in more than 26 years.  The relative strength index, or RSI, has been below 30
since May 11, signaling that oil is poised to climb, said
 Richard Ross , a technical analyst at brokerage Auerbach Grayson
& Co. in New York. The 14-day RSI, which identifies possible
turning points in markets, dropped to 16.3 on June 1, the lowest
level since February 1986.  Oil is unlikely to collapse as it did in 2008 because long-
term fundamentals haven’t changed and supply may not keep up
with demand, Royal Dutch Shell Plc Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  said yesterday in Kuala Lumpur. It would be
“irresponsible” to say that a few weeks of worse-than-expected
economic data has significantly changed the market outlook,
Maria van der Hoeven, the head of the  International Energy
Agency , said in the Malaysian capital.  Economic Outlook  Bank of America trimmed estimates for  Brent crude  in the
second half to $106 a barrel, from $110, and for West Texas
Intermediate to $97 from $107, according to an e-mailed report.
It lowered 2013 forecasts for Brent to $110 from $120 and for
WTI to $100 from $111.  “Europe is now facing the increased possibility of a full-
blown banking crisis,” said  Francisco Blanch , head of
commodities research for Bank of America in New York. “In
addition to weakening oil demand in  Europe , growth in  emerging
markets  and the U.S. is softer than anticipated.”  The Institute for Supply Management’s  index  of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
 U.S. economy , rose to 53.7 last month from April’s 53.5, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said yesterday. The median forecast
of 75 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected 53.4.
Readings above 50 signal expansion.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose  1.4 million barrels  last
week, figures from the API showed. They are forecast to climb
950,000 barrels in the Energy Department report, according to
the median estimate of 12 analysts in the Bloomberg survey.
Distillate inventories, a category that includes diesel and
heating oil, gained 1.8 million barrels compared with a
projected 250,000 increase.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey. The Department is scheduled to
release its report at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
