Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest bank by assets, hired Gregory Steele to trade high-yield
bonds in the U.S. as the lender captures a greater share of
business managing debt sales.  Steele joined the bank’s investment-banking unit in  New
York  two weeks ago from Macquarie Capital USA Inc. Sanam Alaghband, an RBC Capital Markets spokeswoman, confirmed the
hire. He previously worked at Deutsche Bank AG for the 10 years
ending in 2009.  RBC’s investment-banking unit was one of the firms that
expanded its U.S. fixed-income teams starting in 2009 as the
biggest banks retreated from trading amid the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression. It’s the 10th most-active
underwriter of speculative-grade debt in the U.S. this year, up
from 13th place for the previous two years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is the highest our league table ranking has been in
U.S. high yield,” said Mike Meyer, global head of credit
trading, in a statement.  Steele will trade bonds from industrial, forestry, paper
and packaging, and consumer-product companies, Alaghband said.  High-yield bonds, rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and lower than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s , have gained 4
percent this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. They have declined 2.1 percent since April as
concern mounts that  Greece  will exit  Europe ’s common currency,
disrupting the financial system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
