David Ferrer beat Andy Murray 6-4,
6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-2 to reach the semifinals of the French Open
for the first time.  Ferrer was a quarterfinalist at the clay-court tournament
in 2005 and 2008. The 30-year-old will next play fellow Spaniard
 Rafael Nadal , who is seeking his seventh title at  Roland Garros .  Murray, 25, had one of his most consistent seasons in 2011,
making the semifinals at each of the four major tennis
tournaments. He was beaten last year in Paris by eventual
champion Nadal.  Murray’s exit means Fred Perry remains the last British
male to win a tennis major when he triumphed at the
1936 U.S. Open. Murray has lost all three major finals he’s
played, the last coming at the 2011 Australian Open to top-
ranked Novak Djokovic of Serbia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
