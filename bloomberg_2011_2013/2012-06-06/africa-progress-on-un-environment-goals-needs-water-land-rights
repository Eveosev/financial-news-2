African nations could make faster
progress on United Nations goals for sustainable development by
acknowledging the rights of their citizens to clean water and
land for crop growing, the body’s Environment Program said.  Africa ’s growing population and climate change, which has
forced farmers to cope with erratic weather patterns, are
putting pressure on water supplies and food security, UNEP said
in its Global Environment Outlook released by e-mail today.  Global targets on the sustainable use of the environment
include slowing deforestation, halving the number of those with
no access to sanitary toilets and safe water, and improving
conditions for at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2015.  While almost 90 percent of the world’s population now has
access to clean  drinking water , meeting a UN Millennium
Development Goal ahead of a 2015 deadline, sub-Saharan Africa is
lagging behind  Latin America  and the Caribbean, North Africa and
parts of  Asia . More than 40 percent of those without access to
safe water live in sub-Saharan Africa, according to a March
statement by Unicef and the  World Health Organization .  Governments need to follow the example of the African
Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and counterparts in
 South Africa , Uganda and the  Democratic Republic  of Congo who
recognize in law that water is a fundamental right, it said.  In Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, communities
including the Ogoni indigenous people have used human rights
arguments in court to oppose oil and gas projects they say
threaten to disrupt agricultural production, the report said.  Other groups throughout Africa with similar grievances have
trouble accessing the justice system because of inadequate legal
knowledge and financial resources to fight their cases, it said.  The UN in 2000 established the Millennium Development
Goals, a 15-year plan to reduce poverty and child mortality, and
boost access to health care in developing nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
