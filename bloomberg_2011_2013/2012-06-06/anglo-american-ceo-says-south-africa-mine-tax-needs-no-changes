Anglo American Plc (AAL)  Chief Executive
Officer  Cynthia Carroll  opposes South African tax changes
because the current system already ensures the fair distribution
of the benefits of mining.  Carroll made the comments in reference to a report
commissioned by  South Africa ’s ruling  African National Congress 
recommending additional taxes.  The report “argues that the proposed new tax is necessary
to ensure that the state benefits appropriately from the profits
the  mining industry  earns,” Carroll said today in a speech in
Johannesburg. “Yet the existing royalty regime was introduced
for exactly this purpose.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
