David Newmark, former chief financial
officer of investment-management firm Columbus Hill Capital
Management LP, was sentenced to 54 months in prison for
embezzling more than $10.4 million.  Newmark, 39, was sentenced today in federal court in
 Newark , New Jersey, where he pleaded guilty to  wire fraud  and
 tax evasion  on Jan. 18. He admitted that he created a phony
account to collect deposits that he stole from the Short Hills,
New Jersey-based company, and he agreed to forfeit the entire
amount that he stole.  Newmark attorney Michael Himmel didnâ€™t immediately return a
call seeking comment after the hearing. In an interview after
the guilty plea, Himmel said that Newmark, of Towaco, New
Jersey, has had a sports-betting gambling problem since high
school, and that motivated his theft.  U.S. District Judge William Walls ordered Newmark to pay
$10.4 million in restitution. On May 16, Walls signed a
preliminary order of forfeiture, court records show. The U.S.
has recovered $1.6 million so far, according to a statement
today by U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.  The case is U.S. v. Newmark, 12-cr-36, U.S. District Court,
District of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
