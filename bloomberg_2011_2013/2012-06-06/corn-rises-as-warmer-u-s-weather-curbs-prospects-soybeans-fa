Corn futures extended gains in
electronic trading on speculation that warmer weather forecast
for U.S. growing areas will curb prospects for crop. Soybeans
fell.  Higher temperatures may deplete soil moisture for crops in
the next six to 10 days, Telvent DTN meteorologist Joel Burgio
said in a report today. Some rain may fall early next week, he
said. Parts of Iowa and  Illinois , the biggest corn-growing
states, have received little or no rain in the past week,
National Weather Service data show.  “We’re still dry into next week,” said  Larry Glenn , an
analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter  Kansas . “I haven’t seen
anything great in the forecast, just maybe some scattered
showers. It looks like the fall crops have started rebounding.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 0.2 percent to $5.8725
a bushel at 5:30 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, extending
this week’s gain to 6.5 percent. In May, prices tumbled 12
percent.  Soybean futures for November delivery, the contract with
the most open interest, slipped 0.1 percent to $12.975 a bushel
in  Chicago .  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
