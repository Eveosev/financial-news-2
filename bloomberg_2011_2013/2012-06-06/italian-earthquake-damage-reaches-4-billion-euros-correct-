(Corrects spelling of Maccaferri in first paragraph.)  The two earthquakes that hit northern
 Italy  last month caused more than 4 billion euros in economic
damage, Gaetano Maccaferri, president of employer lobby
Confindustria for the Emilia Romagna region, said at a hearing
before the Senate Industry Committee today.  About 600 industrial companies employing more than 12,000
workers were “directly damaged” by the quakes, with a loss
estimated at about 2 billion euros, Maccaferri said. The area
affected by the quake makes up about 1 percent of Italy’s gross
domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
