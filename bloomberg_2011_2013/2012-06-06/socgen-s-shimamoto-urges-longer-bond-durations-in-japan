Hajime Takata, chief economist at
Mizuho Research Institute Ltd., comments on Japanese bond yields.
He spoke during a telephone interview yesterday.  On demand for safer assets:  “Global financial problems have put strong downward
pressure on yields. Rates on Treasuries, bunds and gilts have
fallen to records, while  Japan ’s 10-year yield slid below 0.8
percent. The next target for 10-year JGB yields may be the
record low of 0.43 percent, depending on how the  European debt
crisis  develops.  “Global bond yields will continue to stay low.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
