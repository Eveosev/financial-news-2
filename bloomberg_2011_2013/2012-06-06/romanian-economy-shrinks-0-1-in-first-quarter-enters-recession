Romania ’s economy posted its second
quarterly contraction in the first three months of the year, re-
entering a recession as the European sovereign-debt crisis and a
cold snap slowed growth in exports and industrial output.  Gross domestic product  contracted a seasonally adjusted 0.1
percent from the previous quarter, after shrinking 0.2 percent
in the fourth quarter, matching a preliminary report on May 15,
the  National Statistics Office  in Bucharest said today in an e-
mail. GDP grew a seasonally unadjusted 0.3 percent from a year
earlier.  The eastern European country’s economy has slipped into its
second recession in four years after exiting its worst decline
on record last year, as European spending cuts slowed exports
including Dacia SA cars. Freezing temperatures and heavy
snowfall in the first quarter also disrupted transportation and
supply chains.  Romania’s output growth will probably slow this year to 1.5
percent from 2.5 percent in 2011 as European austerity measures
hamper export growth, according to International Monetary Fund
forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
