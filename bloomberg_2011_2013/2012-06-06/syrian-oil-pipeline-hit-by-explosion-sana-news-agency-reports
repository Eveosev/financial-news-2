Gunmen blew up a crude-oil pipeline
in the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor, Syrian Arab News Agency
reported, citing Oil Ministry officials.  The 24-inch pipeline was attacked by “an armed terrorist
group” late yesterday in the Ain Ali area south of the village
of al-Quriya, according to SANA. The explosion didn’t affect
production as the company directed crude flow into an
alternative pipeline network, it said.  The pipeline transports crude from the Al-Omar oilfield,
operated by state-run Al Furat Petroleum Co., to the T2 station.
Workers have begun repairs and are due to resume sending oil
through the network within days, according to the report.  Syria ’s energy industry has been targeted by more than 40
attacks since the outbreak of protests against the regime of
President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011, Oil Minister Sufian Alao said April 30. The government has also lost $3 billion in
revenue since the European Union’s decision to stop importing
the nation’s crude last year as it expanded sanctions against
the Assad regime for its crackdown on protesters, Alao said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
