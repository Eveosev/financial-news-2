billion rupees  ($113.3 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
reducing their investment in equities this year to 405.2 billion
rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 12.4 billion rupees of shares and sold
18.7 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India

billion rupees, the data  show .  Offshore funds sold a net 3.47 billion rupees of shares
last month, and 11.1 billion rupees of shares in April, after
being net buyers in each of the first three months of 2012. They

large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
