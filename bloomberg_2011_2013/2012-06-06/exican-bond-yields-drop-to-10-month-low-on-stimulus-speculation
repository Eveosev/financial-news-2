Yields on  Mexico ’s peso bonds dropped
to a 10-month low as speculation mounted policy makers will act
to stimulate the global economy.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2021 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.85 percent at
8:17 a.m. in Mexico City, the lowest since Aug. 23, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price increased 0.06 centavo to
104.56 centavos per peso.  Speculation is mounting that policy makers in the U.S. may
initiate a new round of stimulus to shore up the economy, the
destination for 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials
stand ready to act as the euro region’s growth outlook worsens,
while damping expectations that another round of three-year
funding for banks is imminent.  The peso climbed 0.2 percent to 14.1895 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 14.2188 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
