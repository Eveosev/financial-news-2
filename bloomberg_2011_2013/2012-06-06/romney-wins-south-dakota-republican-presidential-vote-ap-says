Presumptive Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney won the South Dakota primary, according to
the Associated Press, one of five nomination contests today.  Romney surpassed the required number of delegates needed
for his party’s nomination on May 30 with his victory in the
Texas primary. With no active opposition, he easily won today’s
primary in New Jersey and was favored in California,  New Mexico 
and Montana.  With 29 percent of South Dakota’s precincts reporting,
Romney had 65 percent of the vote in the AP tally. Former
Senator  Rick Santorum  of Pennsylvania and Representative Ron Paul of Texas each had 13 percent, and former U.S. House Speaker
 Newt Gingrich  of Georgia had 5 percent.  Republicans will formally nominate Romney, 65, at their
national convention Aug. 27-30 in Tampa, Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
