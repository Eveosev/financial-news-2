Dry weather in southern  Russia , the
world’s third-biggest wheat exporter, will curb development of
the grain, according to RZ Agro Holding Ltd.  Wheat crop losses of between 15 percent to 30 percent may
be seen in the Rostov, Krasnodar and Stavropol regions, Stephane
Mac Farlane, chief executive officer at the company, said today
in an interview. The three regions accounted for about 30
percent of Russia’s total crop last year after they harvested
27.3 million metric tons of grains, according to state
statistics.  “There is not much improvement to see,” Mac Farlane said.
“They don’t even need any rain now.” Rain in the three regions
can hurt the quality of wheat at its current stage of
development, which requires dry weather before harvesting,
according to Mac Farlane.  Wheat futures gained 1.7 percent to $6.235 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade by 6:01 p.m. London time.  The company, owned by two Louis Dreyfus family members and
billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s AFK Sistema, is keeping its
wheat crop estimate for the country at 54 million metric tons
for the season that starts July 1 before drying and cleaning,
said Mac Farlane. Last year’s wheat crop in Russia was 56.2
million tons, according to state statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
