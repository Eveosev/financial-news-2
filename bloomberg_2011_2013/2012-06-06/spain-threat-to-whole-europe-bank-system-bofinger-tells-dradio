Peter Bofinger , an economic adviser
to German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , said a Spanish banking
collapse could threaten the whole European banking system
because Spain’s lenders have foreign liabilities of 160 billion
euros ($201 billion),  Deutschlandradio Kultur  reported today.  Europe is now experiencing the failure of a strategy that
has been followed in the past two years and that has included
quick and maximum budget cuts and solidarity only in
emergencies, Bofinger said, according to the radio channel.
Europe faces “a pile of broken glass,” he told DRadio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
