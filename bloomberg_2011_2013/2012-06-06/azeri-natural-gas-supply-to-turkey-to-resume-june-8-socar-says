Azerbaijan will resume natural-gas
supplies to  Turkey  on June 8 after suspending shipments because
of an explosion on the Turkish section of the BP Plc-operated
South Caucasus pipeline, State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan President
Rovnaq Abdullayev told reporters in Baku today.  Gas deliveries from the Shah Deniz field, also led by BP,
were stopped on May 29 at the request of the Turkish state
pipeline company Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS, or Botas,
which operates the pipeline in Turkey, BP said.  Azerbaijan exports 6.6 billion cubic meters of gas to
Turkey a year. The volume will be increased by an additional 6
billion cubic meters when production of Shah Denizâ€™s second
phase starts in late 2017 or early 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
