Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  agreed to
sell 809 million pounds ($1.25 billion) of Australian corporate
real estate loans to a  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Blackstone Group LP (BX) 
joint venture for about 388 million pounds in cash.  Lloyds will use the proceeds from the deal to repay debt,
the London-based company said in a statement today. The loans
generated losses of 183 million pounds last year, said Lloyds,
the U.K.’s second-biggest government-aided bank.  “This transaction further de-risks the Australian
business,” removing 92 percent of the non-performing real
estate loans, Dave Smith, chief executive officer of Lloyds
International Pty Ltd., said in the statement. Smith’s company
is a Sydney-based unit operating in  Australia  and  New Zealand .  European banks are trying to sell real estate assets as
they seek to meet stricter capital rules. Lloyds, which has cut
more than 30,000 jobs since its 20 billion-pound taxpayer rescue
in 2008, last month raised its asset-reduction plan for the year
by 5 billion pounds to at least 30 billion pounds and expects to
meet its 2014 target a year early.  Lloyds gained as much as 6.4 percent in  London  trading, the
most since May 1. The shares were up 1.29 pence, or 5 percent,
at 27 pence at 10:50 a.m. in London, paring the decline for the
past 12 months to  43 percent .  New Regulations  Banks and other creditors cut U.K. commercial real estate
lending by 6.8 percent to 212.3 billion pounds last year as they
tried to meet new regulations, according to a survey by De
Montfort University published on May 18.  Lloyds sold more than 900 million pounds of mortgage-backed
loans to  Lone Star Funds  in December at a 40 percent discount to
par value, two people with knowledge of the matter said at the
time. That portfolio was known as Project Royal.  The company is planning the sale of a portfolio of
commercial property loans known as Project Royal 2, a person
with knowledge of the matter said last month.  The transaction announced today is expected to close in the
third quarter, Lloyds said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
