If you want to see what a whomping looks like,  click here . There you can watch as a  Wisconsin  voter, polite as a dairymaid, slaps Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett in the  face after his loss to Governor  Scott Walker  in last night's recall election. Last night's results are one of the starkest examples yet of  what money can buy. Even before Barrett won the nomination to run against him,  Walker blanketed the state with TV and radio ads. Barrett could never catch up,  nor did he have the wherewithal to do so. Walker had a 7-to-1 cash advantage.  For the first time at the state level, the  Citizens United  Supreme Court  decision showed what unfettered donations can do. State elections are so much cheaper  than a presidential election. For a mere $63 million, you can be sure that  business interests as opposed to workers will prevail. Much of the money fueling  Walker’s effort to cripple public unions was from wealthy out-of-state donors who want to  cripple all unions. For all that money, unions are no match. Labor called hundreds of  thousands of voters and knocked on thousands of doors in a massive  get-out-the-vote effort -- and lost. This is likely to embolden Walker  wannabes. Watch as Republican governors go after public sector unions across the  country. It’s a win-win situation. Even if they don’t have a cooperative  Republican legislature (as Walker did) to push the changes through, they will  attract the support of a growing legion of business interests that see an  opportunity to wound labor. With few exceptions (Joe McCarthy comes to mind), Wisconsin is known for civility, in its politics and sports.  Vince Lombardi  liked to win but he liked  to do it with decency. This election showed Wisconsin to be more like  Washington  -- uncivil to the point of brutish. Scuffles broke out in voting lines, and  neighbors stopped speaking to neighbors, as politics moved from engaging the  mind to boiling the blood. One winner that cut across the partisan divide is the  Marquette University Law School poll . It  had Walker leading Barrett by 7 percentage points going into Election Day, and 7 points it  was. No one wants to talk to anyone who interrupts dinner these days, but it  helps if the caller is a cheesehead with a Waukeshan accent. The remnants of civility in Wisconsinites were evident in  exit polls  asking about the recall: Most don’t approve. Ten percent said recalls are never  appropriate for any reason; 27 percent that recalls are appropriate for  any  reason.  Barrett won those folks big time. But he was swamped by the 60 percent that  said recalls  are legitimate only for official misconduct. Walker won that group, 68 to 31. While  pro-recall forces got 900,000 signatures, more than 2.5 million people  voted. Marquette also predicted the anomaly that Walker could win big and leave  no coattails for Romney to ride. According to exit polls, 18 percent of the very people  who gave Walker his victory favored Obama. Maybe sometimes, to paraphrase Freud, a state election is just a state election.
