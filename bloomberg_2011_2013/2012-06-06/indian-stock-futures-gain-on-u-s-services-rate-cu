Indian stocks had the year’s best
rally as global equities advanced ahead of a European Central
Bank meeting today to decide on interest rates, and as recent
declines lured investors.  State Bank of India , the nation’s biggest lender, paced
gains among its peers.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the largest truckmaker
and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, jumped the most in about four
months. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  soared 2.7 percent to
16,454.3 at close, matching the gauge’s advance on Jan. 3.  While most economists predict the ECB will keep interest
rates on hold, 12 of the 44 surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a
cut. UTI Asset Management Co., the country’s best-performing
debt-fund manager, expects the  Reserve Bank  of India to cut its
key  interest rate  by 25 basis points at its review on June 18
after Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  signaled slowing growth and
lower oil prices increased scope for easing. India’s economy
 grew  5.3 percent in the March quarter from a year earlier, the
least in nine years.  The RBI cut rates on April 17 for the first time in three
years, after raising it a record 13 times from mid-March 2010 to
October 2011 to cool consumer prices. Inflation averaged 7.1
percent in the first four months of this year, compared with 9.5
percent in the whole of 2011. Crude- oil prices  in New York have
fallen 14 percent this year.  Offshore  investors  withdrew a net  $103 million  from local
shares on June 4, reducing their investment in Indian equities
this year to $8.3 billion, according to the market regulator.  Foreigners reduced holdings by $273 million in May. Still,
investments into local equities are at record levels, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
