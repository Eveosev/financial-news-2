Vladimir Krutov, a member of the
Soviet Union hockey team’s KLM Line in the 1980s, died this
morning after suffering a stomach hemorrhage, the International
Ice Hockey Federation said. He was 52.  Krutov, a 5-foot-9, 195-pound left wing, won two Olympic
gold medals and helped the Soviets to five world championships.
Center Igor Larionov and right wing Sergei Makarov joined him to
make up the KLM unit that is considered one of the most dominant
in international hockey history.  The trio was often paired with defenders Vyacheslav Fetisov
and Alexei Kasatonov in a lineup known as the “green unit”
because they wore green practice jerseys. All five players have
been inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame.  During his career with the Soviet national team, Krutov won
a gold medal at the 1979 and 1980 World Junior Championships,
and gold at the 1984 and 1988 Winter Olympics. He was also part
of the 1981 Canada Cup-winning team, which defeated Canada 8-1
in the championship game in  Montreal , and won 11 national
championships with  CSKA Moscow .  In international competition, Krutov totaled 89 goals and
75 assists in 123 games.  He joined the  National Hockey League ’s Vancouver Canucks in
1989, scoring 11 goals and 23 assists in 61 games before
returning to  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
