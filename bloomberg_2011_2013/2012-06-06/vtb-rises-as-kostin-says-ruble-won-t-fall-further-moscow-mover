VTB Bank, Russia’s second-biggest
lender, rose for a third day after Chief Executive Officer
 Andrei Kostin  said the central bank will step up efforts to halt
a slide in the ruble and as the currency advanced.  VTB advanced 1.9 percent to 5.3 kopeks by the close in
Moscow, after gaining as much as 2.3 percent earlier. Russia’s
currency climbed 1.8 percent to 32.42 per dollar. The ruble fell
12 percent last month, the most of 25 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg and the sharpest drop since January 2009.  “The central bank will start to support soon the bottom of
the corridor” it uses to measure the ruble against the dollar
and euro, Kostin said in an interview on Bloomberg TV today.
“The central bank is willing to spend more dollars,” he said
in Istanbul. “I’m not expecting the ruble to depreciate
further.”  Bank Rossii has spent about $200 million a day supporting
the ruble in the past three days, Chairman Sergey Ignatiev told
reporters in  St. Petersburg  earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
