Tunisia  may reduce grain imports by
29 percent this year because of bigger domestic crops, according
to Agriculture Minister Mohamed Ben Salem.  Grain imports may drop to 1.2 million metric tons from 1.7
million tons last year as output climbs to 2.5 million tons from
2.3 million tons, Ben Salem said in an interview yesterday.
About half of this year’s harvest will be durum wheat, he said.  “The initial estimate for the grain harvest this year is
excellent,” Ben Salem said. Tunisia’s harvest season usually
begins this month.  Domestic production will cover about 60 percent of local
needs, according to the minister. Rain destroyed 14,000 hectares
(34,595 acres) of a total of 1.35 million hectares of grains
planted, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
