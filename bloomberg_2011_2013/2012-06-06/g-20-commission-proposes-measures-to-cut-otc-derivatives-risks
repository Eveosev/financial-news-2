A commission appointed by the Group
of 20 nations called for stricter regulation to reduce the risk
in over-the-counter, or OTC, derivatives markets.  The final report, published today by the International
Organization of Securities Commissions, said that greater
transparency was needed among derivatives market intermediaries,
or DMIs, which include brokers, in OTC derivatives markets to
avoid a repeat of the risks to the global economy created by the
2008 financial crisis.  The publication listed 15 recommendations, including the
registration or licensing of DMIs and publicly available
information on those companies.  Madrid-based IOSCO brings together national market
regulators from more than 100 countries to coordinate rules and
share information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
