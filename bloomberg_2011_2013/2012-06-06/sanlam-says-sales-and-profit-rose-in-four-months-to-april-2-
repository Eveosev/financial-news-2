Sanlam Ltd. (SLM) , the largest South
African-based insurer, said sales and profit rose in the four
months to April.  Earnings from Sanlam’s financial-services businesses
increased 7 percent from 3.76 billion rand ($446 million) at the
end of 2011, the Cape Town-based insurer said in a statement
today. Earnings excluding one-time items climbed 6 percent in
the period.  “The group achieved pleasing results in a difficult
operating environment for the four months ended April, with the
identified growth markets delivering particularly satisfactory
results,” Sanlam said. The company had net fund inflows of 8
billion rand.  The insurer, which operates in  Africa ,  Europe , the U.K.,
U.S. and India, is targeting lower-income earners in  South
Africa  with cheaper insurance products. Sanlam invests some of
its insurance premiums in equities. The  FTSE/JSE All Share Index (JALSH) 
gained 7.6 percent in the four-month period.  “Relative market movements may have a major impact on the
growth in group earnings to be reported for the six months ended
June,” Sanlam said. The operating environment is “expected to
remain challenging and is likely to impact on growth in the
group’s key operational performance indicators,” it said.  Sanlam has almost 5 billion rand in discretionary capital
and remains “focused on identifying” investment opportunities,
Johan van Zyl, chief executive officer of the insurance group,
said on a conference call today.  Sanlam gained 1.3 percent to 33.91 rand in Johannesburg
trading, its highest in seven weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
