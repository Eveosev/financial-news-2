Greylock Capital Management President
Hans Humes, whose hedge fund helped negotiate  Greece ’s debt
restructuring this year, said an exit from the euro by the
nation would have a “domino effect” in Europe.  The system “is too integrated at this point,” said Humes.
“The big domino is Greece and then the next one. There’s are a
series of decisions that you have to be concerned about and one
is the markets saying we want to clear out of country debt and
that’s not the  hedge funds , that’s the banks here in Europe.”  A euro exit “would be too big of a catastrophe for both
sides,” Humes told reporters at the Institute of International
Finance meeting in Copenhagen today, where he participated in a
panel on sovereign debt crises.  Humes, who was a member of the committee of private
bondholders that negotiated Greece’s restructuring with
government officials, said  Europe  needs to restore confidence in
the ability of governments to refinance their debt and guarantee
deposits to prevent bank runs. Confidence that economic growth
will recover and that bad loans won’t increase will limit the
funding needs for Spanish banks, he said.  “What you need is a game-changer on the confidence side,
and you also have to backstop the outflows,” said Humes. “It’s
probably going to be enough to say we will do something and then
take the time to do it. It’s not a set number. It will depend on
how bad the crisis is. You’ve got to stop the panic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
