The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2 basis points to
204 basis points as of 11:04 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Credit
Agricole SA. (ACA)  The gauge is set for its lowest close since May 31,
CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside of Japan declined 3 basis points to 202 as of
8:04 a.m. in  Hong Kong , also on course for the lowest close
since May 31, according to  Credit Agricole  and CMA prices.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 3 basis points to 199
basis points as of 9:12 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is down from 217.3 on May 18, which was its
highest since October, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
