Kenya ’s shilling extended its gains
for a third day against the dollar after the country’s central
bank left its policy rate unchanged at a record high.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy climbed 0.4
percent to 85.45 a dollar by 9:31 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi,
bringing its gain so far this week to 0.8 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Nairobi-based Central Bank of Kenya yesterday left its
benchmark  interest rate  at 18 percent for the sixth meeting in a
row to help support the currency and curb inflation.  Uganda’s currency gained for the second day, increasing 0.1
percent to 2,487.50 a dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling declined
less than 0.1 percent to 1,588.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
