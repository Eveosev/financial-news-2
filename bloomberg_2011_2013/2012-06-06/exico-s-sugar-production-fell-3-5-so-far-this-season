Sugar output in  Mexico , the worldâ€™s
sixth-largest producer, fell 3.5 percent so far this season,
according to industry committee Conadesuca.  Production in the 2011-12 season, which started in October,
totaled 4.97 million metric tons through June 2, Conadesuca said
in a  report  on its website yesterday. That compares with 5.16
million tons a year earlier.  Mexico will produce 5.04 million tons of sugar this season,
down from a previous forecast of 5.1 million tons, Conadesuca
estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
