Three workers are missing and eight
men were injured after a private munitions storage near the
Bulgarian city of Sliven, 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast
of the capital Sofia, exploded.  Some 130 people from the villages of Lozenetz and Gorno
Alexandrovo near the storage depot were evacuated yesterday,
Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said in an interview with
state radio in Sofia today. The explosions of anti-tank missiles
started around 2 p.m. yesterday and continued through the night,
with the last blast registered about 6 a.m. today, he said.  A section of the main highway linking Sofia with the Black
Sea port of Burgas, which passes near the where the explosions
occurred, is closed, Tsvetanov said. Military engineers will
look for the missing people and investigate the cause of the
explosions after they stop, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
