The  Baltimore Orioles  selected the
son of Hall of Fame infielder Cal Ripken Jr., who spent his
entire 21-year career with the franchise, in the 20th round of
the Major League Baseball draft.  The Los Angeles Dodgers drafted the son of former Cy Young
Award winner  Orel Hershiser , who played 13 of his 18 major-
league seasons with that team, in the 34th round.  Ryan Ripken, 18, is a 6-foot-6 first baseman who played at
the  Gilman School  in Baltimore, where his father was an
assistant coach. He received a baseball scholarship to the
University of South Carolina, which has won the College World
Series the past two seasons.  Ripken’s father joined the Orioles as a second-round pick
in the 1978 draft and played for the team from 1981 to 2001.
Ripken played in a record 2,632 straight major-league games and
was twice selected as the  American League ’s Most Valuable Player.
He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.  Jordan Hershiser, 23, is a 6-foot-8 right-handed pitcher
from the University of  Southern California . Hershiser, who was
the 1,046th player selected, made five relief appearances for
the Trojans this season and had a 1.69 earned run average.  His father had a 204-150 record with a 3.48 ERA over 18
major-league seasons and won the National League Cy Young award
with the Dodgers in 1988. Orel Hershiser was drafted by the club
with a 17th-round pick in 1979.  Baseball’s 40-round first-year player draft, which began
June 4, concluded yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
