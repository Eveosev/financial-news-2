Credit derivatives traders settling
contracts that protected against a default by Residential
Capital LLC set a value of 17.625 cents on the dollar for the
debt of  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) ’s mortgage unit.  The price, the result of a final round of bidding by 12
dealers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG,
means sellers of the swaps would pay 82.375 cents on the dollar
to buyers of protection to settle the contracts, according to
data posted on a  website  of auction administrators Markit Group
Ltd. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s Creditex division.  A net demand to buy $29 million of the bonds was matched
with orders from the dealers and their clients after an initial
market mid-price of 18.625 cents was set in the auction’s first
round.  Sellers of the contracts, used to hedge against losses or
speculate on creditworthiness, pay the buyers face value of the
amount being protected, less the value of the underlying debt.  The  International Swaps and Derivatives Association ’s
determinations committee had said ResCap’s May 14 bankruptcy
filing triggered payouts on the swaps.  Banks,  hedge funds  and other institutional investors had
bought or sold a net $1.2 billion of protection against a ResCap
default as of June 1, according to the Depository Trust &
Clearing Corp., which runs a central repository for the credit
swaps market.  The mortgage lender listed $15.7 billion in assets and
$15.3 billion in debt in Chapter 11 papers filed in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
