JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s $150 million
settlement of a lawsuit over losses from the bank’s securities
lending program won approval from a federal judge.  The suit was filed by three union pension funds, which
represent a class of investors that lost money placed for them
by New York-based JPMorgan in medium-term notes issued by Sigma
Finance Corp., a structured investment vehicle that collapsed in
2008.  The union pension funds representing the class are the
AFTRA Retirement Fund, the Imperial County Employees’ Retirement
System and the Investment Committee of the  Manhattan  and Bronx
Surface Transit Operating System.  U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan approved
the settlement in an order signed yesterday and made public
today.  The case is Board of Trustees of the AFTRA Retirement Fund
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 09-cv-00686, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
