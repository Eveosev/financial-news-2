OAO Gazprom was offered new assets by
 BASF SE (BAS)  in exchange for two Siberian deposits, Deputy Chief
Executive Officer  Alexander Medvedev  said.  Gazprom is holding talks with Wintershall, BASF’s oil and
production unit, on the swap, Medvedev told reporters today in
Kuala Lumpur, without naming the assets.  Russia’s gas-export monopoly said in October it planned to
swap assets with Wintershall after the opening of the country’s
first gas pipeline directly to Europe. Gazprom was due to get 50
percent of Wintershall’s oil and gas fields in the southern part
of the North Sea under the deal, while the German producer would
acquire 25 percent plus one share in blocks 4 and 5 of the
Achimov formation in the Urengoy field.  The talks were due to be completed this year, Anna
Bungarten, a Wintershall spokeswoman, said in December. She
wasn’t immediately available for comment today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
