China , Russia, Kazakhstan and other
members of the  Shanghai Cooperation Organization  will enhance
their joint efforts on regional security to maintain stability
and development, Chinese President  Hu Jintao  said.  The six-nation group, which also include Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, will also play a greater role in
Afghanistan’s “peace and reconstruction,” Hu was quoted as
saying in a written interview with China’s official People’s
Daily newspaper.  The six nations also plan to create better conditions for
 logistics and travel  by reaching an agreement on facilitation of
international road transportation, Hu was cited as saying. The
newspaper, which is published by China’s Communist Party, didn’t
say when such an agreement might be signed.  Beijing is hosting a two-day summit of leaders from the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s member states that begins
today. The group also includes India, Pakistan, Iran and
Mongolia as observer states and Belarus and  Sri Lanka  as
“dialogue partners.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
