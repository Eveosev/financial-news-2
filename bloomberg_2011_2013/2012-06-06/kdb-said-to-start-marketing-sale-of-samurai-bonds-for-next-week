Korea Development Bank  started
marketing a sale of as much as 50 billion yen ($635 million) of
Samurai bonds planned for next week, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the matter.  KDB told investors it plans to price the two-year notes to
yield 60 basis points to 75 more than the yen swap rate as soon
as June 13, said the person, asking not to be identified because
the information is private.  The lender is following Export-Import Bank of  Korea , known
as Kexim, in selling yen-denominated debt as the  benchmark
government bond yield  dropped to 0.79 percent this week. Thatâ€™s
the least since June 2003 and the lowest after 0.502 percent for
 Switzerland  globally. Kexim sold a record Samurai bond for a
South Korean borrower last month.  The lender will also offer three-year Samurais yielding 70
basis points to 85 more than the benchmark, and five-year debt
at a spread of 80 basis points to 95, the person said.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Nomura Holdings
Inc., Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. (8411)  are helping Seoul-based KDB with the sale, the person said.  Two calls to the mobile phone of KDB spokesman Park Chan Ho
and his office number went unanswered. Today is a public holiday
in  South Korea .  KDB last sold Samurai bonds Oct. 12, when it raised 53.7
billion yen including 3.7 billion yen of two-year 1.45 percent
notes priced to yield 105 basis points more than yen swaps, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield premium fell to 58.6 basis
points yesterday, according to JS Price data on Bloomberg.  The 100 billion yen of notes sold by Kexim on May 17
included 51.4 billion yen of 1.11 percent notes due 2014 priced
to yield 70 basis points more than the benchmark, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
