European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials will extend their offerings of unlimited
cash until the start of 2013 for periods up to three months as
they try to head off risks stemming from the euro region debt
crisis.   “We have decided to continue our main refinancing at fixed
rate, full allotment for as long as necessary” and at least
until January, Draghi told reporters in  Frankfurt  today. He
didn’t indicate whether the ECB plans to offer banks a new round
of three-year cash.   The ECB today left its benchmark  interest rate  at 1 percent
as the debt crisis tightens its grip on the euro-area economy,
increasing pressure on policy makers to deliver further
stimulus. Draghi also said today that the euro region economy
faces “increased downside risks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
