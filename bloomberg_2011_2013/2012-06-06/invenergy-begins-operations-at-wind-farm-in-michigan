Invenergy LLC, a closely held
renewable-energy developer, began commercial operations at
Michiganâ€™s largest wind farm.  The 212.8-megawatt Gratiot County Wind Project has 133
 General Electric Co. (GE)  turbines, Chicago-based Invenergy said
today in a statement on its website.  DTE Energy Co. (DTE) , a Detroit-based power company, owns 69 of
the turbines and Invenergy owns the rest. DTE is buying all the
power from the wind farm under a 20-year contract, it said in a
separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
