Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV) , the
largest homebuilder in  New Jersey , reported an unexpected profit
for its fiscal second quarter as orders jumped 52 percent amid
rising U.S. demand for new houses. The shares surged.  Net income  for the three months ended April 30 was $1.8
million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a loss of $72.7
million, or 69 cents, a year earlier, the Red Bank-based company
said today in a statement. The average  estimate  of nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a loss of 32 cents a share.  The profit was Hovnanian’s first after eight straight
quarters of losses. U.S. homebuilders are reporting increased
orders as job gains and record-low mortgage  rates  help lure
buyers. Purchases of new homes in the U.S. rose 3.3 percent in
April from the previous month to an annual pace of 343,000, the
Commerce Department said May 23.  Hovnanian is “benefiting from the overall lift in the
housing market,  Megan McGrath, an analyst at MKM Partners LLC
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a telephone interview. ‘‘It
was a good quarter. They beat us fair and square.’’  She has a sell rating on the shares.  Hovnanian’s net contracts for the quarter jumped to 1,775
homes from 1,166 a year earlier, the company said. Revenue
increased 34 percent to $341.7 million.  Contract Backlog  The builder’s contract backlog, an indication of future
sales, rose 48 percent from a year earlier to 2,298 homes. The
cancellation rate was 17 percent, down from 20 percent in the
second quarter of 2011.  Chief Executive Officer  Ara Hovnanian  said the company was
able to increase prices or reduce incentives in about 40 percent
of its communities during the first half of fiscal 2012.  ‘‘As our sales pace is increased, we have tested pricing
increases,” he said during a conference call with investors.
“We’ve been gradually increasing prices because the last thing
we want to do is push prices too far and slow down our sales
pace.”  The stock gained 18 percent to $2.01 at the close in  New
York . It was the best performance in Bloomberg’s 13-member
homebuilder  index , which rose 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
