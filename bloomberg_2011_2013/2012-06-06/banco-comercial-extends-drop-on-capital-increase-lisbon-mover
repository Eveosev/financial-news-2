Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) ,
 Portugal ’s second-biggest bank by market value, declined to a
record low in Lisbon trading today after tapping state funds to
bolster its finances.  Banco Comercial  fell  as much as 18 percent and closed down
8 percent at 8.2 euro cents, giving the lender a market value of
591 million euros ($740 million).  Banco Comercial dropped for a third day since Portugal said
on June 4 that it has committed to buying 3 billion euros of
hybrid securities from the lender with an initial annual
interest rate of 8.5 percent. The state also plans to underwrite
Banco Comercial’s planned 500 million-euro capital increase at a
price of 4 cents a share.  “The capital increase was higher than expected and
continues to weigh on Banco Comercial shares,” said Jose Novo,
a trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon. “It will be hard for BCP to
pay back the state after the capital increase.”  Banco Espirito Santo, which completed a 1.01 billion-euro
share sale on May 2 that was fully subscribed to by investors,
rose 2.3 percent to close at 53 cents in Lisbon trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
