Serbia will ask  Danieli SpA (DAN) , Italy’s
biggest steel-mill engineering company, to keep a planned 500
million-euro ($624 million) investment in the country, even
after it opted for iron mills in neighboring Croatia.  Danieli has “postponed until further notice” the plan to
set up a steel plant in Sabac, western Serbia, after buying CMC
Sisak d.o.o., a unit of U.S.  Commercial Metals Co. (CMC) , in Sisak,
eastern Croatia, said  Boris Tadic , Serbia’s former president,
who aspires to become the new prime minister.  “We will fight for them, but this is not a good signal,”
Tadic told reporters in Belgrade today, after meeting with
President Tomislav Nikolic on efforts to gather a ruling
coalition. He said he’d urge Danieli officials to resume the
Serbian investment.  Political uncertainty in Serbia where parties have been
unable to form a government a month after May 6 elections, was a
factor in the Danieli decision, Tadic said.  Buttrio, Italy-based Danieli signed a memorandum of
understanding with Serbia on March 29 on developing the plant in
Sabac that would produce some 750,000 tons a year and whose
clients might include  Fiat SpA (F) ’s car factory in Kragujevac,
central Serbia.  Danieli spokesman Paolo Messina declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
