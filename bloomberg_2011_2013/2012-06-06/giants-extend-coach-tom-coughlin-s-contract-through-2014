Tom Coughlin  signed a contract
extension with the  New York  Giants that lasts through the 2014
season, four months after leading the National Football League
team to its second Super Bowl title in five seasons.  Financial terms of the extension weren’t disclosed in a
news release sent by the team. Coughlin, 65, is entering his
ninth season with the Giants, a tenure that has included five
playoff appearances and two Super Bowl championships.  The team won the NFL championship with a 21-17 victory over
the  New England Patriots  in Indianapolis last February.  “Tom is the right person in the right job at the right
time,” Steve Tisch, co-owner of the team, said in the news
release. “I just really appreciate how our players respond to
his leadership, and obviously our organization has benefited
tremendously because of the relationship Tom has with his
players.”  Coughlin has a 142-114 regular-season record in 16 years as
a head coach, including eight with the  Jacksonville Jaguars .
He’s 12-7 in the postseason, including the two Super Bowl
championships with the Giants, both over the Patriots.  Coughlin’s 74 regular-season wins give him the third-
highest total among coaches in franchise history, behind  Bill Parcells and Hall of Fame member Steve Owen. His eight
postseason victories leave him tied with Parcells for the team
record.  “It has always been my belief that it is an honor and a
privilege to be head coach of the  New York Giants ,” Coughlin
said in the release. “We’ve got a lot of work left to do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
