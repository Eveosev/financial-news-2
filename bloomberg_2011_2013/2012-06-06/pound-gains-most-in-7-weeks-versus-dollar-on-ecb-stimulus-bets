The pound rose the most in 11 weeks
versus the dollar after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials were ready to act to counter the debt
crisis, easing concern the turmoil will harm the U.K. economy.  Gilts tumbled, with 10-year yields climbing the most since
March, as optimism over  Europe  and a U.K. report showing retail-
price inflation accelerated in May, damped demand for the fixed
returns from government debt. Gilts also declined on speculation
the Bank of England will keep its program for bond purchases, or
quantitative easing, on hold at a policy meeting tomorrow.  “There’s a slight improvement in risk appetite, which is
helping the pound,” said Michael Derks, chief strategist at
FXPro Financial Services Ltd. in London.  The pound strengthened 0.5 percent to $1.5465 at 4:24 p.m.
in  London  after climbing as much as 0.9 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since March 16. Sterling advanced 1 percent to
122.35 yen, and was little changed at 80.92 pence per euro.  The ECB kept its key  interest rate  at a record-low 1
percent and President Mario Draghi said officials will extend
their offerings of unlimited cash to banks until the start of
2013 for periods up to three months.  “We monitor all developments closely and we stand ready to
act” as the economy faces “increased downside risks,” Draghi
said in  Frankfurt  after the policy meeting.  U.K. retail prices rose 1.5 percent last month from a year
earlier, after gaining 1.3 percent in April, according to a
report from the  British Retail Consortium  and Nielsen Co.
Separate data today showed U.K. construction growth slowed in
May, and business confidence declined.  ‘Doing Well’  “Sterling is doing well as we are seeing flows out of the
dollar but nobody wants to start piling into the euro,” said
Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and institutional
treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in London.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt climbed 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 1.65 percent after rising
as much as 14 basis points, the most since March 14. The 4
percent bond due March 2022 dropped 1.275, or 12.75 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 121.07. The yield declined to a
record 1.439 percent on June 1.  “The fact that the ECB hasn’t moved today has taken some
pressure off the BOE to follow tomorrow,” said Philip Rush, an
economist at Nomura International Plc in London. “We think
there will be more QE from the BOE but that it will come in
August, not tomorrow.”  The central bank left its target for  bond purchases 
unchanged at its previous meeting on May 10. Morgan Stanley and
Deutsche Bank AG both predict the  Bank of England  will resume
the stimulus program tomorrow.  Gilts have returned 3.9 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained 4.8 percent,
while Spanish debt has lost 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
