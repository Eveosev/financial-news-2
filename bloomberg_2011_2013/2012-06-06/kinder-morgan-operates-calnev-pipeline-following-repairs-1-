Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP)  is
operating the CALNEV pipeline after repairing a leak at a pump
station near Baker, California, that caused a minor spill.  A pump seal malfunction at a booster station resulted in
“very minimal product being released on our property,” Emily Mir Thompson, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “We
have cleaned up the product, made necessary repairs to the seal
and returned the line to service. There is no impact to
supply.”  The release was less than five gallons, she said.  Kinder’s CALNEV pipeline system transports gasoline, diesel
and jet fuel from Los Angeles refineries and marine terminal to
Las Vegas, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
