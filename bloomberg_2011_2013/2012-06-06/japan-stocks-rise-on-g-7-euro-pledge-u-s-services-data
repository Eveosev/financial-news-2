Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose
the most in seven weeks after Group of Seven leaders agreed to
coordinate efforts on Europe’s debt crisis before the region’s
central bank meets today.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , which generates 39 percent of its
revenue in Europe, added 11 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a
carmaker that relies on the U.S. for a fifth of its sales,
climbed 2.5 percent after the yen extended losses against the
dollar yesterday. Tokyo Derica Co., a seller of women’s leather
handbags, surged 17 percent after canceling a share sale.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.8 percent to 8,533.53 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading, its biggest gain since April 18. The gauge
fell nine straight weeks through June 1, the longest losing
streak since 1992. Shares extended gains on speculation
investors adjusted positions before the quarterly settlement day
for futures and options at the end of the week.  “The G-7 sent a message that they will do something if the
market falls further,” said Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment
officer of RCM  Japan  Co. RCM oversees about $153 billion
globally. “Valuations signal a buy. The market is waiting for a
turnaround in overseas circumstances.”  The broader Topix Index gained 1.5 percent to 718.56 on
speculation shares were oversold after dropping this week to its
lowest since 1983. The measure fell 18 percent from this year’s
high on March 27, entering a  bear market  amid slowing growth in
China and concern the European crisis is deepening. Stocks on
the measure are valued at 0.85 times book value, about the same
level as in October 2008 amid the global financial crisis.  Futures, Options Settlement  Stocks extended gains as investors bought to minimize
losses on bets the Nikkei 225 will fall ahead of a June 8
quarterly settlement of futures and options contracts, according
to Kenichi Hirano, general manager and strategist at Tachibana
Securities Co. in Tokyo. The settlement is known as the
“special quotation.”  “As we get close to the special quotation, I think few
people had expected the Nikkei to go above 8,500 today,” Hirano
said. “Sellers are poised to buy back above that level.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.5
percent today before the  European Central Bank  meets in
Frankfurt and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  testifies
before the  U.S. Congress  on the economic outlook.  “Investors are waiting to see if we get signs of new
additional monetary easing out of today’s ECB and tomorrow’s
Bernanke,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior strategist
at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest
bank by market value. “A selloff is taking a pause, but it’s
not that we have convincing reasons to buy.”  G-7 Pledge  Shares also rose after G-7 officials said they will work
together to help  Spain  and Greece get their public finances on
sustainable footing, Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  told
reporters in  Tokyo  after a conference call. The yen fell against
the dollar yesterday as he indicated the group remains
supportive of intervention to address extreme currency moves.  Spain may receive a precautionary  credit line  from the
European Financial Stability Facility, Germany’s Die Welt
newspaper reported in a preview of a story, citing unidentified
people familiar with the matter.  Exporters to Europe climbed, with Nippon Sheet Glass rising
11 percent to 81 yen. Shimano Inc., a maker of bicycle parts
that depends on Europe for 36 percent of its sales, gained 1.7
percent to 4,800 yen.  Companies that do business in the U.S. advanced after the
yen yesterday slid against 15 of its 16 major counterparts
including the greenback. Toyota added 2.5 percent to 2,999 yen.
 Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker that gets 23
percent of its revenue in the Americas, rose 2.4 percent to
1,845 yen.  Tokyo Derica Soars  Tokyo Derica surged the most on the 1,674-member Topix
after it scrapped a stock sale. Three shareholders had planned
to sell 1.83 million shares to the public, the company said on
May 25. The shares jumped 17 percent to 701 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  slid 3.9 percent to 26.90,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 8 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume was 27
percent below the 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
