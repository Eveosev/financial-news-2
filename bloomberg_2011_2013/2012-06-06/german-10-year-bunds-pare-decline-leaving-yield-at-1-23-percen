German 10-year government bonds pared
a decline as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
“it wouldn’t be right for monetary policy to fill other
institutions’ lack of action.”  The 10-year yield was two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, higher at 1.23 percent as of 1:59 p.m. London time, after
rising as much as seven basis points to 1.28 percent.  Draghi was speaking in Frankfurt after ECB policy makers
left the main refinancing rate at a record-low 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
