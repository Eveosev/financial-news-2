Turkey , pushing the planned Trans-
Anatolia Pipeline to carry Caspian natural gas to  Europe , said
 Azerbaijan  remains supportive of the project even after reports
that alternative routes were still being considered.  “President  Ilham Aliyev  and our prime minister, Tayyip
Erdogan, have the political will to implement the project,”
Turkish Deputy Energy Minister Murat Mercan told reporters in
the Azeri capital, Baku, today. Mercan said he hoped talks will
be completed by the end of the month.  Azerbaijan and Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding
to build the 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) link in December. Even
so, the proposed Nabucco project, an alternative pipeline via
Turkey, remains an option, the deputy head of the Azeri state
oil company, Elshad Nasirov, told  Die Presse  newspaper in May.  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, known as Socar, holds 80
percent of the Trans-Anatolia Pipeline project, or Tanap,
estimated to cost $5 billion to $7 billion. The rest is held by
Turkish state pipeline company Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima
AS, or Botas, and energy producer Turkiye Petrolleri AO.  Tanap is designed to deliver gas from the BP Plc-led Shah
Deniz field in the  Caspian Sea  to Europe via Turkey. It would
then link up with pipeline projects vying for gas-export rights,
including Nabucco West, a scaled-down version of the European
Union-backed Nabucco venture.  The BP-led group is due to make a final pipeline choice by
the middle of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
