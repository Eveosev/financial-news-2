The Philippine peso climbed the most
in a week as foreign companies pledged to invest more than $500
million in the Southeast Asian nation, boosting the growth
outlook. Bonds advanced.  Glencore International Plc plans to invest $500 million to
$600 million to expand its Philippine unit’s smelting capacity
and build a power plant, President  Benigno Aquino ’s office said
in a statement today. Gazasia Ltd., a London-based alternative
fuel company, also agreed to build a plant that will convert
organic waste material into energy, the statement said. The
economy expanded 6.4 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since 2010, official data show.  “There is renewed confidence in the  Philippines  with
Aquino’s platform of transparency and a level-playing field
gaining ground,” said Antonio Espedido, treasurer at China
Banking Corp. in  Manila .  The peso advanced 0.6 percent to 43.190 per dollar at the 4
p.m. close in Manila, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show. The
currency touched 43.185, the strongest level since May 22. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, fell 0.5 percentage point to 7 percent.  The yield on the 6.375 percent government bonds due January
2022 fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.45
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  Aquino, accompanied by his trade, finance, energy, defense,
tourism, transport and foreign affairs secretaries, has been
visiting the U.K. and will head to the U.S. next, where he is
scheduled to meet President  Barack Obama  on June 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
