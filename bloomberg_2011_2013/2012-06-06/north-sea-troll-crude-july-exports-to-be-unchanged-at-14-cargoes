Exports of North Sea Troll crude in
July will be unchanged from June at 14 cargoes, a final shipping
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Troll exports will total 8.4 million barrels, or 270,968
barrels a day, compared with 280,000 barrels a day for June,
according to the plan.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil company, operates the
field. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
