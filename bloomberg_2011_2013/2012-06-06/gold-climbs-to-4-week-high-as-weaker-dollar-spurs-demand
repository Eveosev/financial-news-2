Gold rose to a four-week high in
London as a weaker dollar increased the metal’s appeal as an
alternative asset.  The dollar declined versus the euro amid speculation the
world’s leading economies will collaborate on a response to
Europe’s debt crisis. Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago President
 Charles Evans  said recent U.S. economic data warrant “extremely
strong accommodation.”  “A weaker dollar would implement stronger gold,”  Afshin Nabavi , a senior vice president at bullion refiner MKS Finance
SA in Geneva, said today by phone. “The safe-haven investor has
been very shy since December. If they decide to get back into
the market, then there’s potential for a lot of upside.”  Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 1.3 percent
to $1,637.40 an ounce, the highest price since May 8, and was at
$1,633.38 by 11:21 a.m. in London. August-delivery futures were
1.1 percent higher at $1,634.60 on the Comex in New York.  The metal is up 4.5 percent this year after 11 consecutive
annual increases. Gold at the morning “fixing,” used by some
mining companies to sell output, rose to $1,633.25 an ounce in
 London  from $1,606 in the afternoon of June 1. There were no
fixings the previous two days because of U.K. public holidays.  Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors
agreed to help Spain and Greece place their public finances on a
sustainable footing, Japan’s Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  told
reporters in Tokyo following a conference call yesterday.
European Central Bank officials meeting in  Frankfurt  will leave
 interest rates  at 1 percent today, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “Finding a way to deliver more accommodation -- whether it
is monetary or fiscal -- is particularly important now because
delays in reducing unemployment are costly,” Evans said in a
speech yesterday in  New York . “Failure to act aggressively now
will lower the capacity of the economy for many years to come.”  Silver for immediate delivery rose as much as 2.8 percent
to $29.3425 an ounce, the highest price since May 10, and was
last at $29.3275. Palladium was little changed at $624.25 an
ounce, after reaching $629.50, the highest price since May 8.
Platinum climbed as much as 2.4 percent to a two-week high of
$1,472.25 an ounce, and last traded at $1,461.  To contact the reporters for this story:
