Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  will close an aluminum
factory in Saint Jean de Maurienne, France, unless it reaches an
agreement with Electricite de France SA by mid-September on an
electricity-supply contract,  Les Echos  reported, citing
executives at the companies.  Under the existing supply contract, which dates from 1985,
Rio Tinto pays two to three times less than the going rate for
power, Les Echos said. Negotiations for a new pact are dead, a
the newspaper said, citing a person close to EDF that it didnâ€™t
identify.  Rio Tinto will try to sell the site if no agreement is
reached, and has already sounded out possible buyers, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
