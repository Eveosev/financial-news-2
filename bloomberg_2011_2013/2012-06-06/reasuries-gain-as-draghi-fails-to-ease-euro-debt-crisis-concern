Treasuries snapped two days of losses
on concern European policy makers aren’t doing enough to resolve
the region’s debt crisis and a report showed U.S. productivity
fell more than estimated in the first quarter.   U.S. government debt also erased losses after Atlanta
Federal Reserve President  Dennis Lockhart  said today that
extending the central bank’s Operation Twist program is an
“option on the table.” European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said officials will extend their offerings of unlimited
cash as they try to head off risks stemming from the crisis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
