Wiener Privatbank SE (WPB)  agreed to take a
75 percent stake in Matejka & Partner Asset Management GmbH from
Themis Privatstiftung.  The remaining 25 percent are held by founder and managing
director Wolfgang Matejka, the bank said in a statement today.
The parties agreed not to disclose the purchase price.  Themis was founded by Ronny Pecik senior’s RPR
Privatstiftung and his sonRonny Pecik junior is the
foundation’s beneficiary, Wolfgang Matejka said in an e-mail.  Wiener Privatbank has been expanding its corporate and
private banking business since hiring Eduard Berger, the former
head of the Vienna office of Credit Agricole SA’s CA Cheuvreux
brokerage, last year. After the closing of Wiener Privatbank’s
acquisition, which is expected for the third quarter, Alfred Reisenberger, who joined the bank together with Berger, will
join the asset management company’s board.  Pecik senior, supported by Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris , has spent about 1 billion euros ($1.26 billion) to
build a 20 percent stake in  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  since the autumn
of last year.  Format magazine reported on June 1 that Pecik is paying
about 9 million euros in interest charges a quarter to the
creditors that helped him finance the stake. He has a 3 million-
euro payment due on June 30 and may have received money from
Russian billionaire Elena Baturina to stabilize his stake,
Format said. News magazine reported yesterday that Pecik may
sell his stake to  Carlos Slim .  Pecik didn’t return calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
