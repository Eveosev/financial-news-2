John Paulson , the billionaire hedge-
fund manager seeking to reverse record losses in 2011, posted a
13 percent decline last month in his Gold Fund as bullion and
mining stocks fell, said a person briefed on the returns.  The loss leaves the fund, which can buy derivatives and
other gold-related investments, down 23 percent this year.  Armel Leslie, a spokesman for New York-based Paulson & Co.,
which manages about $24 billion, declined to comment on the
returns, some of which were reported earlier today by Business
Insider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
