PetroSA, South Africa’s state-owned
oil company, made an application to secure oil from  Nigeria , the
 Democratic Alliance , South Africa’s main opposition political
party, said.  The Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. said PetroSA didn’t
follow protocol procedures as the application should have been
made directly by the government, the DA said in an e-mailed
statement today. NNPC, Nigeria’s state oil company, will award
oil supply contracts on June 15, according to the statement.  PetroSA spokesman Kaizer Nyatsumba didn’t immediately
respond to a voice message left on his mobile phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
