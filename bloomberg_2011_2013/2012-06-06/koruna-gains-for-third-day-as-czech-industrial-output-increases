The koruna strengthened for a third
day against the euro after Czech industrial production expanded
more than expected and as European stocks rallied on optimism
policy makers will take steps to spur economic growth.  The Czech currency appreciated 0.7 percent to 25.460 per
euro by 4:38 p.m. in  Prague , taking its gains so far this week
to 1.3 percent.  Industrial output for April climbed 2.2 percent from a year
earlier, the statistics office in Prague said today, beating the
1.2 percent median forecast of 15 analysts polled by Bloomberg.
The euro strengthened and commodities increased as the cost of
insuring Spanish bonds against default fell from a record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
