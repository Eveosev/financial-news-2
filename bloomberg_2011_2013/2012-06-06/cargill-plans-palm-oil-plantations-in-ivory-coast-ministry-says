Cargill  Inc. plans to develop
industrial palm-oil plantations and processing facilities in
Ivory Coast within five years, according to the country’s Labor
Ministry.  The company may invest as much as 200 billion  CFA francs 
($380 million) in the project, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday, citing Cargill’s West Africa director,
Lionel Soulard.  The food and agriculture company, based in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, is one of the biggest cocoa exporters in the West
African nation, the world’s top grower of the crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
