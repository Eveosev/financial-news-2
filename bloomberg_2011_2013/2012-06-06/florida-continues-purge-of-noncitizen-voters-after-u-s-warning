Florida  will continue to remove
noncitizens from state voter rolls even after the U.S.  Justice
Department  warned the program may violate federal law.  Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, an appointee of
Republican Governor  Rick Scott , said in a letter today to the
Justice Department that the efforts are legal and nobody is
removed without an opportunity to be heard. The state has
identified about 2,700 potential noncitizens in its database of
11.2 million voters.  T. Christian Herren Jr., head of the Justice Department’s
voting section, told Detzner in a May 31 letter that the state’s
procedure appears to violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the
1993 National Voter Registration Act. Ron Labasky, general
counsel for the Florida State Association of Supervisors of
Elections, advised supervisors in 67 counties to suspend the
purge until the dispute is resolved.  With 29  electoral  votes, Florida is the biggest prize among
states that campaigns for both President  Barack Obama , a
Democrat, and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney, view
as competitive. In the previous three presidential elections in
Florida, the combined vote for Republican candidates was 10.9
million and 10.8 million for Democrats.  Chris Cate, a spokesman for Detzner, said the purge of
voter rolls would continue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
