Russia  will keep its tax on raw sugar
imports at $140 a metric ton in July, the Customs Union
Commission of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan said.  The duty is based on monthly sugar prices in  New York , with
a one-month lag, according to the commission, which oversees the
tariffs for the three countries. The sweetener averaged 20.25
cents a pound, or $446.42 a ton in May, according to a statement
today on the commissionâ€™s website.  The rate was also $140 in April, May and this month,
according to commission data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
