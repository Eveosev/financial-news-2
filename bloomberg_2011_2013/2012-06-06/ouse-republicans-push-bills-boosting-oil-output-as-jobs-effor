U.S. House Republicans seeking to
boost domestic oil production are reviving their legislative
efforts, saying a package of measures will help reduce
unemployment.  Lawmakers will introduce legislation today that includes a
measure linking use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve with
increasing energy production on federal lands, and requires the
U.S. Interior Department to set goals for oil and gas output on
federal land, according to an e-mail.  The Republicans, who blame President  Barack Obama ’s
administration for a rise in gasoline prices at the beginning of
this year, were unable to advance similar bills as part of
legislation on transportation issues. Advocates didn’t get
enough supporters for a measure that would link increased output
on federal land with additional funding for highway
construction.  Representatives  Kevin McCarthy  of California, the No. 3
House Republican, Doc Hastings of Washington, chairman of the
House Natural Resources Committee, and  Fred Upton , head of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, will discuss the measure --
called the Domestic Energy and Jobs Act -- at 3 p.m. today in
Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
