Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
mobile-phone carrier, is teaming up with  Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) ,
Honda Motor Co. and other automakers to promote the use of
fourth-generation wireless Internet features in cars.  The 4G Venture Forum for Connected Cars will encourage
manufacturers, suppliers, device makers and other companies to
use the new long-term evolution wireless standard, which allows
for faster Internet connections, Verizon said today in a
statement. The group also includes Bayerische Motoren Werke AG,
Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp.  Verizon is trying to capitalize on its LTE network, which
is more extensive than those of  AT&T Inc. (T)  and Sprint Nextel
Corp. The company also wants to tighten ties with the auto
industry as cars get more wireless features for communications,
safety and Internet access. Verizon is under pressure to find
new sources of growth amid saturation in the market for phones.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the co-owner of Verizon
Wireless, announced plans last week to buy  Hughes Telematics
Inc. (HUTC)  for $612 million in cash, vaulting the telephone company
deeper into the automotive-technology market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
