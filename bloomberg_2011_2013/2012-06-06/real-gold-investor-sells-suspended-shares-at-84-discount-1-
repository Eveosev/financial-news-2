A shareholder of  Real Gold Mining
Ltd. (246) , a Chinese gold producer halted from trading for the past
year after allegations of financial discrepancies, sold shares
off market at an 84 percent discount.  Cheah Co. cut its stake to 8.5 percent from 9.4 percent
after selling 7.9 million shares at an average price of HK$1.40
each, according to a  filing  to the Hong Kong stock exchange
yesterday. That compares to the last traded price of HK$8.86 on
May 27, 2011, before the shares were suspended. Cheah is the
controlling shareholder of  Value Partners Group Ltd. (806) , a Hong
Kong-based asset manager.  Regulators and investors have increased scrutiny of Chinese
companies after earnings delays and accounting disputes. Real
Gold is seeking to address a South China Morning Post newspaper
report that said the company may have filed two different sets
of accounts.  “The sale was due to normal fund redemption,” Anne Lui, a
spokeswoman for Value Partners, said by phone. The fund sold the
shares in the over-the-counter market and has no intention to
reduce its stake further at the moment, she said.  The asset manager is the third-biggest shareholder of Real
Gold, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The identity of
the buyer wasn’t disclosed.  Real Gold must conduct an independent forensic accounting
investigation and publish all financial results outstanding
before it can resume trading, the company said in March, citing
a letter received from the stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
