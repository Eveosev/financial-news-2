Ethanol futures climbed in  Chicago  on
speculation that more-expensive corn will lead to higher
manufacturing costs.  Prices increased as dry, warm weather in the Midwest
threatened corn crop development. One bushel of the grain makes
at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel and based on the July
contracts for corn and ethanol, producers are losing 7 cents on
each gallon manufactured, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol “was definitely up,” said Jim Damask, a manager
at BiofuelsConnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “It was strong, but not as strong as people were
expecting.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery advanced 2.1 cents, or
1 percent, to settle at $2.052 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  In spot market trading, ethanol in Chicago jumped 2.5
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.01 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive increased 2.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.075,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  rose 2 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.07 a
gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel advanced 1.5 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.215.  Corn for July delivery rose 18.75 cents, or 3.3 percent, to
$5.8625 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
