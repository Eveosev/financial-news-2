General Electric Co. (GE)  has agreed $3.6
billion of sales for a wind turbine model it began selling a
year ago that generates higher-than-normal energy output.  GE expects to install more than 1,500 of the 1.6-100 model
turbines by next year in countries including Brazil, Turkey, the
U.S. and Canada, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said.  The model, with a rotor diameter of about 100 meters (330
feet), offers 19 percent higher annual energy production at wind
speeds of 7.5 meters a second, GE said in an e-mailed statement.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  and  Siemens AG  are among companies
also developing turbines that cut the cost of generating power.
Vestas said today it developed a turbine for high winds.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
