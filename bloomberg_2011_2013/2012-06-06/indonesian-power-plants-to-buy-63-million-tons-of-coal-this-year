Coal-fired power stations in
 Indonesia  agreed to buy 63 million metric tons of the fuel this
year, about 10 percent more than forecast consumption to
minimize outages, according to the state electricity firm.  Indonesia will need an estimated 57.3 million tons of coal
in the country’s  power plants  this year, said Helmi Najamuddin,
head of the coal division at Jakarta-based PT Perusahaan Listrik
Negara, in an interview yesterday.  “Our contracts must be higher than demand to avoid any
possible supply disruption,” Najamuddin said at the Coaltrans
Asia conference in Bali, Indonesia. About 23 companies will
supply the fuel to Listrik Negara and independent producers.  Listrik Negara and independent producers may need more
than 100 million tons of coal after 2017, almost double this
year’s estimated figure, Najamuddin said June 4.  Indonesia is adding 10,000 megawatts of electricity
generation to support its economic growth, with 60 percent of
the capacity starting by the end of this year, Najamuddin said.
Listrik Negara controls 28,302 megawatts of installed generating
capacity, or 85 percent’s of the country’s total, according to
data from the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
