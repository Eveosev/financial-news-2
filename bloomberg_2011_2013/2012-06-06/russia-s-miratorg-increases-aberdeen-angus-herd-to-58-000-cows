Miratorg Agribusiness Holding,
 Russia ’s largest pork and animal-feed producer, brought in
another shipment of Aberdeen-Angus cows, bringing its total herd
to 58,000, the company said today.  A ship carrying 4,770 cows arrived from the U.S. at the
Ust-Luga port near  St. Petersburg  on the Baltic Sea on June 3
after an 18-day journey, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. The cattle were transported to the company’s farms in
the Bryansk region in western Russia.  Miratorg plans to increase the herd to 80,000 breeding
cattle in autumn and to 112,000 cows by the beginning of next
year, in a bid to start beef output after 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
