Consumer prices in  Ecuador , which
uses the  U.S. dollar  as its official currency, fell in May at
the fastest pace since August 2009, as the rainy season ended,
easing supply chain problems and cutting food costs.  Prices declined 0.19 percent from April, the National
Statistics and Census Institute said today in a report on its
 website . Annual inflation slowed to 4.85 percent from 5.42
percent.  Food prices fell 0.88 percent from a month earlier after
the end of above-average rainfall that caused about $223 million
of damage to crops, washed out roads and disrupted supplies.  Consumer prices fell the most in the highland city of
Ambato, sliding 0.45 percent in May from the previous month,
while prices dropped 0.06 percent in the nation’s largest city,
Guayaquil, the agency said.  Annual inflation will average 5.14 percent this year,
compared with 4.47 percent in 2011, according to the  Finance
Ministry ’s 2012 budget.  Producer prices increased 1.43 percent in May from the
previous month and 5.84 percent from May 2011, today’s report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
