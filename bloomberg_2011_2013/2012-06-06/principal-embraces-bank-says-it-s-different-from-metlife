Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , the
provider of life insurance and retirement products, affirmed its
commitment to banking as rivals depart to limit regulation.  Principal benefits from the ability to hold government-
insured deposits “as a way of parking people’s money while they
develop their plans” for retirement, Jim McCaughan, chief
executive officer of the firm’s global investors business, said
today at a conference in New York.  MetLife Inc., which is subject to greater government
oversight because of its size, is exiting banking after the
Federal Reserve rejected the insurer’s plans to boost its
dividend and resume share buybacks.  Hartford Financial Services
Group Inc. (HIG)  and  Allstate Corp. (ALL)  have also retreated from banking.
Des Moines, Iowa-based Principal is regulated as a savings and
loan, while MetLife is considered a  bank holding company .  “Don’t paint everyone with the same paint brush,”
Principal Global Investors Chief Operating Officer Barb McKenzie
said today at the conference, which was sponsored by KBW Inc.
“What’s going on with us and the relationship with the Fed is
really profoundly different, at this point at least, to what
Met’s been experiencing.”  McKenzie said Principal underwent a three-week Fed review
that she described as “collaborative.”  “I’ve met crazy regulators all around the world, and these
were not crazy regulators,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
