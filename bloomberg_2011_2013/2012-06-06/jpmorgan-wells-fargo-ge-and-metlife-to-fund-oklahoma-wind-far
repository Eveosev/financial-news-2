(Corrects to remove reference to GE as investor in
headline and second paragraph of story published June 6.)  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, led a group of investors that agreed to provide $220
million in tax-equity financing for an Oklahoma wind farm.  JPMorgan,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , and Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co. will provide the funds in the fourth quarter,  Enel
SpA (ENEL) , the project developer, said today in a  statement .  The 235-megawatt Chisholm View wind farm is expected to
begin producing power by the end of the year. It will use 140
 General Electric Co. (GE)  wind turbines and sell its output to
Southern Co.â€™s Alabama Power utility for 20 years.  The deal lets the investors receive a share of the tax
benefits associated with Chisholm View, according to the
statement. That includes the  production tax credit , which
provides 2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour for power produced by wind.  The tax credit is scheduled to expire Dec. 31, though
projects that enter operation before then will remain eligible.  A GE unit agreed April 2 to purchase a 51 percent stake in
the project. Rome-based Enel will own the remaining 49 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
