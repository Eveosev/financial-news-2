French President  Francois Hollande ’s
plan to lower the minimum  retirement age  to 60 from 62 is fully
financed through higher payroll charges, the government said.  The cost in the first full year is 1.1 billion euros ($1.4
billion), peaking at 3 billion euros in 2017, the government’s
spokeswoman, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, said after the weekly
Cabinet meeting. The change, which takes effect Nov. 1 and
involves those who started work as teenagers, will add no more
than 110,000 people a year to the retirement rolls, the
government said in a statement.  “It was a major campaign promise and a needed act of
social justice,” Vallaud-Belkacem told a news conference in
Paris today.  Hollande’s predecessor,  Nicolas Sarkozy  raised the minimum
retirement age to 62 from 60 two years ago. Under Sarkozy’s
measure, those starting work at 17 could still retire with full
benefits at 60, with the result that they had to work two more
years to qualify for a pension than someone who started at 19.  Under Hollande’s changes, full retirement will again be
available at 60 for anyone who began work before they turned 20.
Those retiring at 60 can count no more than six months of
unemployment and six months of maternity leave as part of their
job history, in addition to the one year of sick or maternity
leave allowed under the old system.  The measure is being funded by a 0.1 percentage-point
increase in payroll charges, which Vallaud-Belkacem said amounts
to an extra 2 euros a month on a median French net salary of
1,600 euros a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
