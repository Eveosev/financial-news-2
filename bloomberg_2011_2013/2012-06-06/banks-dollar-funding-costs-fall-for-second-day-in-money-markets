The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell for a second day, according to a money-market
indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 53 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:20 a.m. in
London from minus 56 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the cheapest level since May 31.  The one-year basis swap was 63 basis points below Euribor
from minus 64 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Predictions in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps, a gauge of banks’
reluctance to lend, was unchanged at 32.5 basis points,
according to the  FRA/OIS spread . The Euribor/OIS measure held at
39 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 787 billion euros ($982
billion) from 781 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
