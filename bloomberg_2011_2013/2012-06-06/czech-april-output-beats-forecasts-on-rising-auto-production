Czech industrial production rose more
than forecast in April as the output of vehicles increased.  Industrial  output  increased 2.2 percent from a year
earlier, after a revised 0.1 percent growth rate in March, the
Prague-based Czech Statistics Office said in a statement
published on its website today. The reading was better than the
median forecast of 1.2 percent in a Bloomberg  survey  of 15
analysts.  The biggest contribution to growth came from the
manufacturing of vehicles, which rose 8.3 percent from a year
earlier, the statistics office said.  Industrial production data go against other signs showing a
weakening of the economy in the second quarter. Manufacturing
performed the worst in 33 months in May as new orders fell,
according to the PMI index published June 1. Retail sales fell
the most in two years in April, the statistics office said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
