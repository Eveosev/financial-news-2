Presumptive Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney won the New Jersey primary, according to the
Associated Press, the first of five nomination contests today.  Romney surpassed the required number of delegates needed
for his party’s nomination on May 30 with his victory in the
Texas primary. With no active opposition, he was favored to
easily win today’s other presidential primaries in California,
 South Dakota , New Mexico and Montana.  With 7 percent of New Jersey’s precincts reporting, Romney
had 82 percent of the vote in the AP tally. Representative Ron Paul of Texas had 10 percent, followed by former Senator  Rick Santorum  of Pennsylvania with 5 percent and former U.S. House
Speaker  Newt Gingrich  of Georgia with 3 percent.  Republicans will formally nominate Romney, 65, at their
national convention Aug. 27-30 in Tampa, Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
