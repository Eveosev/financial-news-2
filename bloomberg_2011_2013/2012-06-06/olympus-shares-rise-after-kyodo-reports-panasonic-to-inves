Olympus Corp. (7733) , the camera maker that
admitted to a $1.7 billion accounting fraud, rose to its highest
in more than a month after Kyodo news agency reported  Panasonic
Corp. (6752)  will invest in the company.  The  shares  gained as much as 3.5 percent to 1,378 yen
before trading at 1,338 yen, the highest since March 30, at the
close in Tokyo.  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gained 1.8 percent.  Panasonic is in talks to invest between 30 billion yen
($380 million) and 50 billion yen in Tokyo-based Olympus and
become the largest shareholder, the Kyodo reported today,
without citing anyone. The world’s biggest maker of endoscopes
has said it may shore up  capital  after writing down the value of
assets last year because of the fraud.  “We’re not the source of information for the report,”
Tsuyoshi Oshima, a spokesman for Olympus, said by phone. Atsushi
Hinoki, a spokesman for Panasonic, said the Osaka-based company
isn’t the source of the information.  Olympus will probably post net income of about 5 billion
yen or 10 billion yen in the fiscal year started in April, the
Nikkei newspaper reported today, without saying where it got the
information. That compares with the 25 billion yen  average  of
four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Olympus posted a
loss of 49 billion yen last year.  Olympus is “considering” moves to raise its capital
ratio, President Hiroyuki Sasa told reporters May 10. The
company had a capital ratio of 4.6 percent as of March 31, it
said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
