Egypt ’s benchmark  EGX30 Index (EGX30) 
retreated for a fourth day, losing 0.4 percent to 4,484.71 at
the close in Cairo.  The following shares are active on the Egyptian Exchange.
Stock symbols follow company names.  Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services  (EMOB EY), the Arab
country’s second-biggest mobile-network operator, tumbled 9.9
percent, the biggest decline in more than a year, to 136.38
Egyptian pounds.  “Investors are dumping any scraps they still have on their
books” after the recent tender, said Wafik Dawood, director of
institutional sales at Cairo-based Mega Investments Securities.  Egypt’s bourse executed the sale of 93.9 million shares of
the company at 202.5 Egyptian pounds each, it said last month.
The country’s market regulator approved in April the offer by a
unit of  France Telecom SA (FTE)  to buy the shares.  EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)   advanced as much as 1.9
percent before closing 0.4 percent higher at 10.72 pounds, the
biggest gain in almost a week. The biggest publicly traded Arab
investment bank said it expects regulatory approval “in the
next few weeks” for the creation of a joint investment bank
with Qatar’s QInvest. EFG-Hermes said it is taking legal action
to protect the company and its shareholders amid a plan by
Planet IB Ltd. to buy the investment bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
