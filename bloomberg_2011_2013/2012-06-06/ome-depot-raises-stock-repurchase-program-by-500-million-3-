Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, raised its stock repurchase plan by
$500 million for fiscal 2012, bringing the total to $4 billion.  The timing of the share repurchases will not have a
material impact on the diluted earnings per share in that
period, the Atlanta-based company said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Frank Blake  is working to boost
shareholder returns by operating stores more efficiently,
leading Home Depot to raise its operating margin forecast. The
retailer is assigning more workers to help shoppers, using hand-
held mobile devices to ring up purchases and adding lawn mower
repair to spur sales, executives told analysts today during a
conference call.  Blake said today that Home Depot expects to reach targets
set in 2009 sooner than expected. The company will have 10
percent operating profit and 15 percent return on invested
capital by the end of this fiscal year, and now projects an
operating margin of about 12 percent in fiscal 2015 and a return
on invested capital of about 24 percent.  The higher margins should be “welcomed by investors, but
does not represent an upside to widely held expectations,”
 Colin McGranahan , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.,
wrote in a note today. He rates the stock as market perform, the
equivalent of a hold recommendation.  Sales Increase  The company reiterated today it expects  sales  in fiscal
2012 to rise about 4.6 percent. Last month, the company forecast
revenue this year will slow from the 5.9 percent gain in the
first quarter because warmer-than-normal weather fueled early
purchases of plants and gardening equipment.  Net income in the quarter ended April 29 increased 27
percent to $1.04 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $812
million, or 50 cents a year earlier. Excluding some items,
profit was 65 cents a share, matching the average  estimate  of 25
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Home Depot  rose  3.4 percent to $50.60 at the close in  New
York . The shares have advanced 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
