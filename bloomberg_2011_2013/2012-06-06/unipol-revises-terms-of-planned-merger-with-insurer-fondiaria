Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI)  revised
the terms of its planned merger with  Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA) , lowering
the size of its holding in Italy’s second-biggest insurer after
the transaction.  Unipol’s proposed terms of the merger would give it 61
percent of the new entity, compared with an April 16 request of
66.7 percent, it said in a stock-exchange statement today. The
proposal must be accepted by Fondiaria, its unit  Milano
Assicurazioni SpA (MI) , and  Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF) , Fondiaria’s
controlling shareholder, by June 11, it said.  Unipol agreed in January to buy new shares in Premafin as
part of a plan to rescue unprofitable Fondiaria. The purchase
would allow Premafin to participate in the 1.1 billion-euro
($1.4 billion) stock sale announced by Fondiaria on Jan. 30.
After the capital increase, Unipol’s insurance unit, Premafin,
Fondiaria and Milano Assicurazioni will merge to challenge
Italy’s biggest insurer,  Assicurazioni Generali SpA. (G)   Unipol, based in Bologna, forecast that the new entity will
have more than 300 million euros of additional revenue and cost
savings by 2015. It targets net income of 970 million euros in
2015, and a combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a
percentage of premiums, of 93 percent at the end of 2015, the
company said March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
