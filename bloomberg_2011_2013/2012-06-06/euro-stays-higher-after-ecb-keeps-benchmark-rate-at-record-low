The euro stayed higher against the
dollar after the  European Central Bank  left its benchmark rate
at a record-low 1 percent.  The 17-nation currency also stayed stronger versus the yen.
Forty-nine of 60 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast no
change, 10 predicted a 25-basis-point cut, and one expected a
50-basis-point reduction. Central bank President  Mario Draghi 
will hold a news conference to explain the decision on 2:30 p.m.
Frankfurt time.  “Economic conditions have deteriorated significantly since
their last meeting and downside risks to inflation have
increased, so they’re clearly going to be more dovish today,”
 Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. in London, said before the decision was announced.  The euro traded 0.4 percent stronger at $1.2501 at
12:48p.m.  London  time after falling to $1.2288 on June 1, the
weakest since July 2010. Europe’s shared currency was 0.9
percent higher at 98.98 yen. The dollar gained 0.5 percent to
79.15 yen.  The shared currency declined 0.1 percent when the ECB kept
its benchmark rate unchanged at its previous meeting on May 3.
It weakened 0.5 percent against the dollar on Dec. 8 when the
ECB cut its benchmark to 1 percent and announced a program of
three-year loans to banks.  The ECB said on June 4 it didn’t settle any government-bond
purchases for a 12th week. It began the program in May 2010 as
part of measures to support  Europe ’s higher-yielding debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
