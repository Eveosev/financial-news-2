OAO Acron, Russian billionaire
Viatcheslav Kantor’s fertilizer maker, asked BNP Paribas SA to
amend the terms of a government sale of 20 percent of OAO
Apatit, a supplier to the producer.  The terms require bidders to gain antitrust approval and a
bank guarantee within an “unjustifiably short” period, Acron
said in a statement today on its website. Acron asked BNP to
amend the terms or delay the sale until September, it said.  Apatit is the main production unit of  OAO PhosAgro (PHOR) ,
billionaire Andrey Guriev’s phosphate producer, while Acron buys
phosphates from the company to produce complex fertilizers.  PhosAgro, Acron and Uralchem applied to bid for Apatit’s
stake, according to the companies. The bidders are required to
get antitrust approval for the deal by June 13 and provide a
bank guarantee equal to the minimum price for the stake of 10.5
billion rubles ($325 million), BNP said on May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
