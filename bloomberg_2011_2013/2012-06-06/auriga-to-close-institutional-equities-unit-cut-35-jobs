Auriga Holdings LLC, a New York-based
institutional trading and asset-management firm, will shut its
equities unit after a drop in client activity, Chief Executive
Officer Rich Winter said.  The firm is cutting 35 people from equities research, sales
and trading, reducing the staff to 50, Winter said today in a
phone interview.  “The remuneration from institutional clients is not high
enough at this point to support having the staff of analysts and
researchers,” Winter said. “Unless you have a full banking
group, I think it’s difficult. Businesses right now that are
based on what I would call the honor system, where you put out a
lot of research and hope guys pay for it, are a challenge in a
tough economic environment.”  Average  daily trading  on major U.S. exchanges is down about
10 percent this year from the same period in 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The number of firms policed by the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fell by 54 to 4,402 in
May from the end of last year,  according to data  from the
regulator.  Auriga Holdings is a  majority-owned  U.S. subsidiary of
Auriga Securities Sociedad de Valores SA, a broker-dealer based
in  Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
