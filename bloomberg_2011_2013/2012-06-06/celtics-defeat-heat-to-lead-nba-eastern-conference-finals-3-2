The  Boston Celtics  beat the host
Miami Heat 94-90 to move within one win of the National
Basketball Finals.  The Celtics can advance to the championship round with a
home victory in Game 6 on June 7. Should the Heat win that game,
a decider will be played in Miami two days later.  The series winner will face the Oklahoma City Thunder or
the  San Antonio Spurs  in the NBA Finals. That contest resumes
tomorrow in Oklahoma City, with the home team leading 3-2 in
games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
