Presumptive Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney won the California primary, according to the
 Associated Press , one of five victories for him in nomination
contests today.  Romney surpassed the required number of delegates needed
for his party’s nomination on May 30 with his victory in the
Texas primary. With no active opposition, he easily won today’s
other presidential primaries in New Jersey, South Dakota,  New
Mexico  and Montana.  With less than 1 percent of California’s precincts
reporting, Romney had 81 percent of the vote in the AP tally.
Representative Ron Paul of Texas had 10 percent, followed by
former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania with 5 percent and
former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  of Georgia with 3
percent.  Republicans will formally nominate Romney, 65, at their
national convention Aug. 27-30 in Tampa, Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
