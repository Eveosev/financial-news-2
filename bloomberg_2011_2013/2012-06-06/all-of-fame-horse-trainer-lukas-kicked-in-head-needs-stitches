Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas
received stitches after one of his horses reared up and struck
him on the top of his head at Belmont Park, where he will try
for his fifth Belmont Stakes win with Optimizer.  Lukas, 76, was taken to Winthrop University Hospital in
Mineola,  New York , yesterday, after he was injured in the barn
by 6-year-old Hamazing Destiny, said Ron Anderson, the agent for
jockey Corey Nakatani, who will ride Optimizer in the third leg
of the Triple Crown series June 9.  “I don’t need this on Belmont week, but I guess these
things happen,” Lukas said in a statement issued by the New
York Racing Association. “I will be fine. It’s just a matter of
getting it cleaned up.”  Lukas said he intended to return today to the track in
Elmont, New York.  “He’s conscious, he’s talking, but he will need
stitches,” said Anderson, who accompanied the trainer to the
hospital.  Lukas also has four  Kentucky Derby  and five  Preakness
Stakes  wins. He was inducted into racing’s Hall of Fame in 1999.  Optimizer will run against I’ll Have Another, the 3-year-
old colt trying to become the first Triple Crown winner since
Affirmed in 1978.  To contact the reporter on this story:
