OAO  Norilsk Nickel ,  Russia ’s largest
mining company, reported 2011 profit below analyst estimates on
higher production costs and a loss from discontinued operations.  Net income was $3.6 billion compared with $3.3 billion a
year earlier, Norilsk said today on its  website . Excluding a
$560 million loss on the disposal of utility OAO OGK-3, profit
would be $4.18 billion, it said. That’s less than the $4.67
billion median estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Cash operating costs rose 16 percent to $4.62 billion on
higher expenses for metals purchases and labor costs, outpacing
sales growth, Norilsk said. Revenue grew 11 percent to $14.1
billion, with nickel accounting for half of metal sales.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 0.4 percent to $7.24 billion, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
