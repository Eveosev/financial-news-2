The Free Democratic Party, the junior
partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition, would support
the introduction of a financial transaction tax providing it
doesn’t undermine  Germany  as a financial location, deputy
parliamentary chief Volker Wissing told  Die Welt .  The FDP wouldn’t back any proposals for a transaction tax,
demanded by the opposition parties in Germany’s parliament, that
would hurt the real economy, domestic savers or retail
investors, the newspaper cited Wissing as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
