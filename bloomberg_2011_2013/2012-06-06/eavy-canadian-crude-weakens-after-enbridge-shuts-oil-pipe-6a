Western Canada Select oil’s discount
widened versus U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate after
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  shut its 608,800-barrel-a-day 6A crude pipeline
early today.  There are no operational problems and the line was expected
to return to service later today,  Graham White , a Calgary-based
company spokesman, said in an e-mail. The company doesn’t expect
any impact on deliveries, he said.  “Lines are shut down and reactivated throughout the month
for various reasons,” Graham said.  Line 6A transports crude between Superior,  Wisconsin , and
Griffith,  Indiana , according to the company’s website.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened $1 to $25 a barrel
at 2:06 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Syncrude’s discount to WTI narrowed 25 cents a barrel
to $6.75. Bakken oil’s discount was steady at $11.65.  U.S. Gulf Coast crude grades strengthened. Light Louisiana
Sweet’s  premium  to WTI gained 95 cents to $13.55 a barrel. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased $1.30 to $16.45 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s premium gained 85 cents to $11.70. Southern
Green Canyon’s premium widened $1.10 to $12. Poseidon’s premium
increased $1 to $12.25.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened $1.30 to $13.55 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
