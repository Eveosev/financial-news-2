Legg Mason Inc. (LM)  is looking to make
acquisitions of international, equity and alternative
businesses, said Chief Financial Officer Peter Nachtwey.  The Baltimore-based money manager has $700 million to
deploy for potential investments and will look to do “lift-outs
and bolt-ons” rather than transformational deals, Nachtwey said
today at the KBW Asset Management Conference in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
