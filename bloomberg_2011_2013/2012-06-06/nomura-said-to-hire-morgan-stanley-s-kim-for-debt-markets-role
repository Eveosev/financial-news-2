Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s largest
brokerage, hired Kyungwoo Kim to join its debt capital market
origination team in Seoul, according to three people familiar
with the matter.  Kim was hired from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  as a executive director
in Seoul, the people said, asking not to be identified because
the matter is still private. He will report to Mark Leahy,
Nomura’s head of debt origination and fixed income syndicate for
Asia ex-Japan, one of the people said.  Nomura last month hired Wonseok Chae, formerly of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., to head corporate sales and financing in
Korea, according to a release from the Japanese bank. Nomura
said in the statement that it has expanded its corporate sales
and financing group to a team of 30 people across  Asia  outside
Japan since November 2011.  “Korea is a key area of focus in our coverage strategy,”
said Daniel Mamadou, Nomura’s head of corporate solutions and
financing group, said in the statement.  Nomura ranks 23rd this year in arranging international bond
sales of South Korean firms, ten and six notches below rivals
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  and Daiwa Securities Group Inc,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its highest position in
the last five years was 13th in 2009, the data show.  Felicity Albert, Nomura’s Hong Kong-based spokeswoman,
declined to comment on the hiring of Kim. Morgan Stanley’s Hong
Kong-based spokesman, Nick Footitt, confirmed the banker will be
leaving the firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
