Asian  stocks  rose, with the  MSCI
Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  heading for its biggest two-day advance in
five months, as reports showed Australia’s economy expanded
twice as fast as economists estimated and U.S.  service
industries  grew.  Westfield Group (WDC) , the world’s biggest shopping center
operator by assets, advanced 3.5 percent in Sydney.  Sharp Corp. (6758) ,
Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, rose 6.9
percent.  Tokyo Derica Co. (9990) , which sells women’s leather handbags,
surged 17 percent after canceling a share sale.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific climbed 1.3 percent to 111.6 as of
7:23 p.m. in Tokyo, with about four stocks rising for each that
fell. The gauge has dropped 14 percent from its peak this year
on Feb. 29. amid concern growth is slowing in China and the U.S.
as Europe’s debt crisis deepens.  “Expectations for growth have been tempered to such a
degree that economic data points are going to surprise to the
upside,” said Stephen Corry, Hong Kong-based chief investment
strategist at LGT Group, which oversees $12 billion of Asian
assets. “There’s potential for more policy stimulus and markets
are clearly oversold.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1
percent today. The gauge advanced 0.2 percent in New York
yesterday.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Average (NKY)  rose 1.8 percent and Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index climbed 1.4 percent. The equity market in Korea
is closed for a public holiday.  Australian GDP  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.3 percent as a
report showed gross domestic product expanded 1.3 percent in the
first quarter from the previous three months, beating the 0.6
percent average estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  Westfield climbed 3.5 percent to A$9.42.  Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES) ,
Australia’s second-largest retailer and owner of the Coles
supermarket chain, gained 0.7 percent to A$29.11.  In the U.S., service industries sustained their pace of
growth in May, showing the biggest part of the  U.S. economy  is
withstanding the impact of the  European debt crisis .  The Institute for Supply Management’s  index  of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, rose to 53.7 points last month from April’s 53.5, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said yesterday. The  median  forecast
of 75 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected 53.4.
Readings above 50 signal expansion.  Spain, Greece  Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group
of Seven economies agreed to coordinate their response to
Europe’s financial crisis on a conference call yesterday. G-7
officials said they will work together to help Spain and Greece
place their public finances on a sustainable footing, Japanese
Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  told reporters in Tokyo following the
call.  The yen fell against the dollar as Azumi indicated G-7
nations remain supportive of intervention to address extreme
currency moves. A weaker yen boosts earnings for Japanese export
earnings when repatriated. The yen dropped 0.5 percent to 78.75
per dollar yesterday, extending its decline to 0.9 percent this
week.  Sharp rose 6.9 percent to 419 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7201) ,
Asia’s biggest automaker, advanced 2.5 percent to 2,999 yen.
Nissan Motor Corp. added 2.5 percent to 741 yen.  Spain may receive a precautionary  credit line  from the
European Financial Stability Facility, Germany’s Die Welt
newspaper reported in a preview of a story that will run today,
citing unidentified people familiar with talks about the
possible option.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific fell 3.2 percent  this year  through
yesterday, compared with a 4.1 percent drop on the Stoxx Europe
600 Index and a 2.2 percent gain on the S&P 500. Declines in
regional equity markets cut the average price of stocks on the
Asian benchmark to 11.2 times estimated earnings, the lowest
this year. That compares with 12.3 times for the S&P 500 and 9.8
for the Stoxx 600.  Tokyo  Derica surged 17 percent to 701 yen as it canceled
the sale of 1.83 million shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
