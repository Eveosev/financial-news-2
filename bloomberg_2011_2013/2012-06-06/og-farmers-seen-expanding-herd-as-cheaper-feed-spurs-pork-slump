Hog producers in the U.S. may be
preparing an increase in pork supplies that will send prices
lower, after three straight years of profit and lower feed costs
encourage bigger herds.  The average profit per hog may be $5 to $8 this year,
compared with $15 to $20 last year, and $10 to $15 in 2010, said
 Mark Greenwood , a vice president at  AgStar  Financial Services
Inc. in Makato,  Minnesota , who is attending the annual  World
Pork Expo  in  Des Moines ,  Iowa , this week. The 25 percent drop in
corn prices during the past year is the “main driver” for
expansion, said Altin Kalo, a commodity analyst  at Steiner
Consulting Group who has studied the industry for a decade.  “Anytime we make money for a period of time, we have a
tendency to expand overall numbers,” said Greenwood, who
oversees $1.4 billion in loans and leases to the hog industry.
“In addition to that, productivity gains continue to be very
good.”  Rising output is bearish for hog futures that have jumped
8.6 percent this year on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Kalo
said. That was the biggest gain except for feeder cattle among
24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.
The  price  of hogs traded in the  spot market  has climbed 9.7
percent this year, government data show.  About 46.415 million hogs were slaughtered this year as of
June 2, up 1.7 percent from a year earlier, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said in a June 1 report. The breeding herd
totaled 5.82 million  sows  as of March 1. That’s up 0.6 percent
from a year earlier. The USDA is scheduled to release its next
inventory  report  on June 29.  Fatter Pigs  While farmers will begin their expansion by adding 1
percent to 1.5 percent more breeding sows, the majority of the
increase in pork supply will come from fatter animals and bigger
litters, Kalo said.  “For the last six months, we’ve been thinking these
producers are chomping at the bit to expand,” Kalo said in a
telephone interview from Manchester,  New Hampshire . “Everything
seems to point to an expansion. That’s in our bias in our
forecasts for the remainder of 2012 and 2013.”  U.S. pork production in the second half of 2012 may be 2.5
percent higher than the same period last year, Kalo said. Output
in 2012 will be about 2.3 percent higher than 2011, and rise an
additional 2.2 percent in 2013, he said.  The spot price of hogs sold in Iowa and Minnesota, the
biggest U.S. producing regions, will fall 5.8 percent from a
year earlier in the second half of 2012, Kalo said. The slump
will last into 2013, with prices next year dropping about 3.4
percent to 81.5 cents a pound on average, he said.  Cheaper Corn  Lower feed costs will “provide incentives” for continued
hog  expansion , and the number of pigs per litter will keep
rising, the USDA said in a report on May 10. The average number
of pigs saved per litter in the three months ended Feb. 29 was
9.97, a record for the quarter, government data show.  The “key” to expansion is the outlook for “a lot
cheaper” corn, said  Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the
 University of Missouri  at Columbia who has studied the industry
for three decades. The grain tumbled on June 1 to an 18-month
low of $5.51 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Corn output will rise 20 percent to 14.79 billion bushels
as yields expand to a record 166 bushels per acre and farmers
plant the most since 1937, the USDA said on May 10.  Adding more pounds to the animals is making them heavier
when they arrive for slaughter, Kalo said.  Hog carcasses 
averaged 206.71 pounds (93.8 kilograms) on June 4, up 0.7
percent from a year earlier, USDA data show. Weights reached
212.56 pounds on April 12, the highest since at least January
2002.  “We have been increasing efficiencies across the board,”
Shane Ellis, a livestock economist at  Iowa State University  in
Ames, said in a telephone interview. “As that happens, that
means more hogs are going to be hitting the market, particularly
during the fourth quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
