Canadian natural gas fell amid
forecasts of milder-than-normal U.S. weather that may pare
demand for power-generating fuels.  July gas in  Alberta  fell 2.9 percent. Cooling demand in the
U.S. Midwest, the largest consumer of  Canada ’s gas exports, will
trail normal by 59 percent tomorrow, according Belton, Missouri-
based Weather Derivatives. Chicago’s high will be 72 degrees
Fahrenheit (22 Celsius), 5 lower than normal, AccuWeather Inc.
predicted.  “The heat looks like it’s backing off,” said  Kyle Cooper ,
director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston. “That will
help keep a lid” on gas prices.  Alberta gas for July delivery declined 5.5 cents to C$1.875
a gigajoule ($1.73 per million British thermal units) as of 2
p.m.  New York  time on NGX, a Canadian Internet market. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada and the
U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system. NGX gas
is down 34 percent this year.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 3.8 cents to $2.408 per million Btu as of 2:07
p.m.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
0.51 cent to $2.4493 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas declined 3.58 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.1689
per million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, prices were down 8.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $2.2892.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.9 billion cubic
feet, 120 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.06 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.04 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 141 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.84 billion cubic feet today, or 95 percent of its
capacity of 1.98 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.73
billion cubic feet at 12:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
