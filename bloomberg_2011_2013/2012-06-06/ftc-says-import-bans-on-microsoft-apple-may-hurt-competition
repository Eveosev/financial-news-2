Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s bid to block imports of
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Xbox gaming system and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone
based on patents owned by its Motorola Mobility unit may hurt
competition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said today.  The FTC, weighing in on cases at the U.S. International
Trade Commission in Washington, recommended limits on the use of
patents related to industry standards to block imports. Motorola
Mobility is using standard-essential patents in cases against
Microsoft and Apple.  To contact the reporter on this story:
