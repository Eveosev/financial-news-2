RHJ International (RHJI)  said it has the
support of co-investors for a potential purchase of  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) ’s BHF-Bank unit as the Belgian company seeks to add
assets in the financial-services industry.  RHJ’s Kleinwort Benson Group unit has entered an informal
review process with  Germany ’s Bafin financial markets regulator,
the Brussels-based company said today in a statement. RHJ didn’t
identify the planned deal’s backers.  Deutsche Bank has sought a buyer for BHF, which offers
wealth management and investment banking, since acquiring it
through the purchase of Sal. Oppenheim Group in 2010. Bafin’s
approval is essential for RHJ to acquire the business as
Deutsche Bank’s plan to sell to LGT Group last year failed after
the regulator voiced concern about the acquisition by the bank
owned by the family of Liechtenstein’s prince.  RHJ and Deutsche Bank entered exclusive negotiations on
BHF-Bank in July. A purchase of Frankfurt-based BHF-Bank would
complement Kleinwort Benson Group’s services in the U.K., the
 Channel Islands  and Ireland, RHJ said at the time.  A sale of BHF-Bank would follow on Deutsche Bank’s sale of
 Actavis Group hf  to  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  announced in
April. Germany’s largest bank said in February that it booked 97
million euros ($121 million) of expenses related to BHF-Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
