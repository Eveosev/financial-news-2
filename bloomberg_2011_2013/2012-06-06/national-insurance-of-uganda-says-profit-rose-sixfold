National Insurance Corp. (NIC)  of Uganda
said profit surged more than sixfold last year after it
increased investments in properties.  Net income in the 12 months through December climbed to
12.89 billion shillings ($5 million) from 2.02 billion shillings
a year earlier, the Kampala-based company said in a statement
published in the New Vision newspaper today.  Investments in properties increased to 57.8 billion
shillings from 36.4 billion shillings in 2010, the company said.  National Insurance is a unit of Lagos, Nigeria-based
Industrial and General Insurance Plc, which bought a controlling
stake in the company from the Ugandan government in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
