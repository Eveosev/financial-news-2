Egypt  has seized land valued at 64
billion Egyptian pounds ($10.6 billion) that was sold to
investors who didn’t make use of it, Housing Minister Mohamed
Fathi ElBaradei said.  The government confiscated 54 million square meters (13,300
acres) of land in 12 newly built communities, as well as 3,600
feddans (3,470 acres) of land in an area known as the Green Belt
that was intended for agricultural use, ElBaradei said in an
interview in Cairo today.  In comments earlier on Al Arabiya television, the minister
said the land was worth 64 billion pounds, and would be resold
after the country’s political situation stabilizes. The revenue
generated from the sales will be used for social housing and
sewage projects for Egyptian rural areas, ElBaradei told the
Dubai-based station.  The sale of government lands at below-market rates to
investors was among the targets of protesters during the
uprising that ousted former President  Hosni Mubarak  last year.
Mubarak’s critics maintained that officials in his government
cut sweetheart deals with investors, awarding them land at cut-
rate prices and often in exchange for later perks or kickbacks.  Former Housing Minister Ibrahim Soliman was sentenced to
eight years in prison in March after being found guilty by a
Cairo court of facilitating the usurpation of state land and
squandering public funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
