Spanish  industrial production 
unexpectedly fell the most in more than two years in April as
the fourth-largest economy in Europe’s single currency union
 sank  deeper into recession amid surging borrowing costs.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days fell 8.3 percent from a year earlier, the
biggest contraction since October 2009, the National Statistics
Institute in Madrid said today in an e-mailed statement. That is
more than the median forecast for a 6.5 percent contraction by
eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg, and follows a 7.5
percent drop in March.  The Bank of  Spain  said May 29 that the country will slide
deeper into its second recession since 2009 as Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  strives to cut the  budget deficit  by 40 percent in
one year. Spain ended 2011 with a shortfall of 8.9 percent of
gross domestic product, similar to that of  Greece .  The government predicts domestic demand will shrink 4
percent in 2012, more than four times last year’s rate, as
nearly a quarter of the workforce is jobless. Vodafone Group Plc
said on May 22 its full-year operating profit declined 1.3
percent as consumers in Spain, Italy and Greece cut spending.  Investors’ concern that Spain may need to request European
Union aid to shore up its ailing banking system has fueled a
surge in borrowing costs. The yield on Spain’s 10-year benchmark
bond was little changed at 6.31 percent at 8:45 a.m. in  Madrid ,
and rose as high as 6.7 percent on May 30, close to its euro-era
high of 6.78 percent and the 7 percent level that heralded
bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
