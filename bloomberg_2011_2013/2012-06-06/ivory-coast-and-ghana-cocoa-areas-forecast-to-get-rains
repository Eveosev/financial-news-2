Ivory Coast  and  Ghana , the worldâ€™s
largest cocoa producers, will get rains over the next seven
days, potentially helping pod development, according to the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Most areas of top grower Ivory Coast will get at least 40
millimeters (1.57 inches) of rain through June 13, while the
same level of precipitation is forecast for coastal areas of
second-ranking Ghana, data on the NOAA  website  today show.
Northeastern Ivory Coast and most areas in Ghana will get about
20 millimeters, according to the data.  Rains may help to further improve the Ivorian mid-crop, the
smaller of two annual harvests that usually starts in April. Dry
weather earlier this year delayed harvesting there, according to
the  International Cocoa Organization  in  London . The mid-crop has
already started, the cocoa group added.  Ivorian farmers will harvest 370,000 metric tons of cocoa
during the mid-crop period, the ICCO said on May 20. That
compares with a February forecast of 350,000 tons. Ghana and
Ivory Coast accounted for 69 percent of total global cocoa
production last season, the ICCO estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
