The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.9 percent to 590.6 at 5:24 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials jumped
1.1 percent to 1,430.453.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose for a third day in  New York  on shrinking
stockpiles and signs of economic improvement in the U.S., the
world’s largest consumer of crude.  West Texas Intermediate futures gained as much as 1.3
percent. Crude inventories fell 1.8 million barrels last week to
384.1 million barrels, the industry-funded  American Petroleum
Institute  said yesterday. An Energy Department report today may
show supplies slid by 500,000 barrels, according to a Bloomberg
News survey. U.S. service-industry growth unexpectedly
increased, and  Australia ’s economic expansion beat estimates.  Oil for July delivery climbed as much as $1.10 to $85.39 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $85.36 at 9:19 a.m. London time. The contract
yesterday rose 0.4 percent to $84.29, the highest close since
May 31. Prices are 14 percent lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures fell after gaining for two days on
forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather that may increase
demand at  power plants .  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore gasoil swaps for July were unchanged at $110.85 a
barrel. The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude fell 85 cents, or
5.4 percent, to $14.95 a barrel. Jet fuel traded at a premium of
70 cents a barrel to gasoil. This spread, also known as the
regrade, has narrowed 44 percent from May 30, signaling it is
less profitable to make  aviation fuel  compared with a week
earlier.  Naphtha swaps for July rose $28, or 3.7 percent, to $780.50
a metric ton at 10:08 a.m. Singapore time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Japan naphtha’s premium
to London-traded Brent crude futures rose $23 to $30.79 a ton,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Singapore fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining losses from the fuel, narrowed 17 cents to $2.04 a
barrel at 10.02 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Yesterday the spread was at $2.22
a barrel, the widest since May 16.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rose to a four-week high in  London  as a weaker dollar
increased the metal’s appeal as an alternative asset.  Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 1.3 percent
to $1,637.40 an ounce, the highest price since May 8, and was at
$1,636.60 by 9:20 a.m. in London. August-delivery futures were
1.3 percent higher at $1,637.40 on the Comex in New York.  The metal is up 4.7 percent this year after 11 consecutive
annual increases. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded product backed by bullion, were unchanged at
1,273.9 metric tons yesterday, the company’s website showed.  BASE METALS  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn advanced as concerns persisted that the U.S. may miss
a government forecast for record output because rains in the
Midwest may not be enough to rebuild soil moisture that’s been
drained by hot weather. Wheat climbed.  July-delivery corn gained 0.9 percent to $5.7275 a bushel
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 2:57 p.m. in Singapore. Wheat
for July delivery rose 0.5 percent to $6.16 a bushel in Chicago.  Soybeans for November delivery increased 0.8 percent to
$12.8775 a bushel.  Rubber declined to the lowest level in almost 31 months as
a producer group raised its output forecast for this year,
citing higher production than expected in Thailand and
Indonesia, the top two exporters.  The November-delivery contract fell 1.2 percent to end at
241 yen a kilogram ($3,045 a metric ton), the lowest settlement
for a most-active contract since November 2009, on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Futures have lost 8.5 percent this year.  Palm oil  gained for a second day on concern that stockpiles
in  Malaysia , the second-largest supplier after  Indonesia , may
have declined in May to the lowest level in more than a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
