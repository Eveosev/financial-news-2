Ten-year Treasury 10-year yields may
rise to 1.8 percent, a two-week high, CIBC World Markets Inc.
said, citing trading patterns.  Treasury rates on June 1 fell to a record 1.4387 percent,
pushing the 14-day relative-strength index to 20.45 percent,
less than the level of 30 that signals to some traders that
yields have declined too fast.  The term premium, a model created by economists at the
 Federal Reserve , was negative 0.86 percent yesterday after
closing June 1 at minus 0.94 percent, a record. The average over
the past year is negative 0.44. A reading less than zero
indicates investors are willing to accept yields below what’s
considered fair value.  “Yields hit the record low and entered into excessive
levels based on RSI as well as the valuation index developed by
the Fed,” said Kazuaki Oh’e,  executive director  at the debt,
currency and distribution unit of Canada’s fifth-largest lender.
“Treasury yields may approach 1.8 percent.”  Ten-year yields rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.59 percent at 12:05 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note due May 2022
fell 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 14/32.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
