New York  gasoline strengthened after
Petroplus Holdings AG began shutting its Coryton U.K. oil
refinery and imports to the U.S. East Coast declined.  The plant, for which a buyer couldnâ€™t be found, will be out
of production by June 12 or June 13, Russ Ball, an official at
the Unite union, said today by phone. Imports of the fuel to the
East Coast fell 22,000 barrels to 742,000 barrels a day in the
week ended June 1, according to the Energy Department.  The premium for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor, rose 0.5 cent to 0.88 cent
a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prompt delivery rose 1.06 cents to $2.6991 a gallon.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  is returning a hydrocracker at its Port
Arthur refinery in Texas to planned rates after it reduced the
unit charge June 4,  Bill Day , a San Antonio-based spokesman for
the company, said in an e-mail.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the Gulf Coast held at 5.5 cents a gallon versus futures.  Regular gasoline in Chicago slipped 1 cent to a premium of
19 cents a gallon, the first decline for the fuel at the hub
since May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
