Entergy Corp. (ETR) , the second-largest
U.S. nuclear-power generator, is staffing its Pilgrim Nuclear
Power Station in Massachusetts with management and employees
from other plants after the union said the company was “locking
out” workers.  A union assertion that local members reserve the right to
walk off the job at any time without notice is “unacceptable”
because it disregards public safety and may violate the plant’s
operating license, New Orleans-based Entergy said today in a
statement after contract talks with the union failed.  Entergy locked out workers who are “critical to safely
managing” the plant, Dan Hurley, president of Utility Workers
Union of America Local 369, said in a separate statement. The
dispute involves 240 of the plant’s 650 workers,  Rob Williams , a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Entergy  rose  0.4 percent to $65.20 at the close in  New
York .  The Pilgrim nuclear power station in Plymouth is 38 miles
(61 kilometers) southeast of Boston. The 685-megawatt plant can
power about 548,000 average homes. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission announced May 29 it had renewed the 40-year-old
plant’s operating license for another 20 years.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  is the largest U.S. nuclear power generator in
the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
