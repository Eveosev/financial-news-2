Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  added 0.6 percent to 56,118.94 at 11:11 a.m. in Istanbul,
gaining for a fourth day.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Aselsan Elektronik Sanayi & Ticaret AS (ASELS)  , a
Turkish maker of electronic equipment for the defense industry,
rose 3.5 percent to 10.5 liras, the highest level in almost
three weeks, after saying it started talks for an estimated $400
million project. Aselsan plans to complete the talks with a
foreign customer this year on an armed forces’ project estimated
at $400 million, it said in a statement to the Istanbul Stock
Exchange today.  Celebi Hava Servisi AS (CLEBI)  , an airport ground-
handler, jumped 5.3 percent to 15.9 liras, the highest in more
than two weeks. Celebi will buy Newco Airport Services SA’s
businesses at four Spanish airports for 1.5 million euros ($1.9
million) and take over Newco’s 4 million euros of leasing debt
related to airport equipment after regulatory approvals in
Spain, according to a filing with the Istanbul bourse after the
market closed yesterday.  Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL)  , a gold miner, fell
0.3 percent to 36 liras, declining for the first time in four
days, after it was cut to hold from buy at Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
