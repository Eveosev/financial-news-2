The Russian  upper house  of parliament
gave fast-track approval today to a disputed draft law that
increases fines on protesters 150 times, before a major
opposition rally next week.  Lawmakers voted 132-1, with one abstention, to approve the
legislation. Pro-government parties in the lower chamber, the
State Duma, pushed through the  measure  late last night after
opposition members of parliament held up the vote for 12 hours
by submitting hundreds of amendments. The Duma voted 241 to 147,
more than the 226 needed, to ratify it in the third and final
reading after the Just Russia opposition group walked out in
protest.  The law increases the maximum fine for protesters who
violate the law to 300,000 rubles ($9,240) from 2,000 rubles and
to as much as 600,000 rubles for organizers. The opposition
condemned the initiative as an attempt to stifle the
constitutional right to free expression.  Police beat demonstrators in Moscow with batons and
arrested hundreds of them on May 6 when an authorized protest
march by tens of thousands of people on the eve of President
 Vladimir Putin ’s inauguration turned violent. More arrests
ensued in the following weeks during a series of unsanctioned
gatherings.  Activists are protesting non-stop in Moscow, using the
 Occupy Wall Street  movement’s tactics. Opposition groups are
planning another “March of Millions” in the center of the
Russian capital on June 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
