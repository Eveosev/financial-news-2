Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos batted away questions on whether  Spain  would seek a
bailout for its banks as he called for greater integration in
the euro region’s financial industry.  De Guindos declined to answer four questions today from
reporters in Brussels on whether Spain would seek a bank rescue
after he met European Parliament members at a closed-door
meeting. Asked about a report in  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  that
European rescue funds may be lent to Spain’s bank-bailout fund,
de Guindos said European lawmakers hadn’t asked him about it.  “There wasn’t the least issue, the least question about a
bailout,” he told reporters.  Spain backs more integration in the 17-nation euro area’s
financial industry, including joint deposit guarantees and
empowering the rescue fund to recapitalize lenders, de Guindos
said.  Germany  opposes direct injections from rescue facilities;
the rules say aid has to be channeled via governments.  The health of Spanish lenders will be clear in 10 to 15
days, when two international consultants publish stress tests on
lenders’ loan books, de Guindos said. The government expects
those results to chime with an International Monetary Fund
report in April that said most banks would be  resilient  to
shocks, he said.  “After that, the government will take the necessary
decisions, obviously from the point of view of recapitalization
of institutions,” de Guindos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
