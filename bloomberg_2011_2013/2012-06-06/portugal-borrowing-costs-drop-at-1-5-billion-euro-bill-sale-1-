Portugal ’s borrowing costs fell at a
sale of 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) of 12- and six-month
bills that allowed the country to reach its issuance target for
the first quarter.  The securities due in June 2013 were issued at an average
yield of 3.834 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said. That compares with 3.908 percent at the previous auction
of 12-month bills on May 2. The sale attracted bids for 2.7
times the amount offered, the same as in May.  The debt agency also sold 500 million euros of six-month
bills due in December 2012 to yield 2.653 percent, attracting
bids for 4.3 times the amount offered. That compares with 2.935
percent on May 2, when the bid-to-cover ratio was 4.1.  The debt agency sold the maximum set for the auction,
bringing total first-quarter issuance to 4.5 billion euros,
matching a goal it announced in March. There are no further
sales set for this month.  Portugal is cutting spending and increasing taxes to comply
with the terms of the 78 billion-euro aid plan requested last
year from the European Union and the  International Monetary
Fund . Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said March 5 that if
the country can’t tap bond markets to sell longer-maturity debt
by September 2013 because of “external reasons,” it would be
able to count on continued support from the IMF and the EU.  Portugal’s two-year note yield dropped 56 basis points to
10.41 percent as of 11:28 a.m. in  London . Ten-year-bond  yields 
also declined, falling 16 basis points to 11.82 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
