Wouldn’t it be nice if the Beach Boys
got back together to do it again, singing of fun fun fun in an
endless summer of surf, sun and California girls?  The veterans -- boys sounds grotesque -- have reunited for
a 50th-anniversary comeback “That’s Why God Made the Radio.”
It’s a recycling of song ideas and titles that have been running
around the airwaves and in  Brian Wilson ’s head for decades.  “Spring Vacation” is typical, promising to stir up good
vibrations (again). They harmonize “some said it wouldn’t last
-- all we can say is, we’re still having a blast.”  Their motivation may be clearer in the song’s gleeful lyric
“we’re back together, easy money, ain’t life funny.”  “Think About the Days” is a gem and at least three tracks
sound like outtakes from “Surf’s Up” or “Sunflower.” Most of
the instruments are played by Wilson’s regular backing band.
This recording isn’t in the “Pet Sounds” league. Still, it’s
no disaster.  Rating: ***.  Devotees of blissful dream pop -- a fusion of bittersweet
melody with filmy soundscapes -- should turn to the similarly
named Beach House.  The U.S. duo’s “Bloom” is a stunning suite that mixes
heartbreak with joy. Seagulls and waves of strings segue into
the surrendering closer “Irene.”  Rating: *****.  The title track of  Patti Smith ’s “Banga” raves with the
punk power of her earlier “Radio Ethiopia,” as her long-term
collaborator  Lenny Kaye  thrashes his guitar.  “April Fool” is better, unexpectedly tender. Is Smith
mellowing at last? No way.  “Banga” is her first album of new material since 2004.
It’s also her best since “Gone Again” in 1996, which paid
tribute to her late husband and Kurt Cobain. (“Twelve” in 2007
was a collection of cover versions, while she also published the
memoir “Just Kids” in the intervening years.)  Rating: ****.  “One Day I’m Going to Soar” is the first in 27 years from
Dexys, the shambling U.K. band led by Kevin Rowland.  “Attack, Attack!” Rowland barks as “Now” leads the
assault. The CD tells of a man who lost love, money and respect
before clawing his way back -- much like the singer himself.  Rating: ***½.  Garbage was once a cutting-edge act. That was the 1990s. As
before, leader Butch Vig smothers the sound in grungy guitar
riffs with Scottish singer Shirley Manson squealing on top.  If you love acts like Husker Du or Sugar -- or any of
Garbage’s earlier efforts -- the new “Not Your Kind of People”
will press your pleasure button.  Rating: ***.  Beth Ditto  is in fine voice on her band Gossip’s fifth
collection, “A Joyful Noise.” Trouble is, she’s all dressed up
with nowhere to go and little new to say this time. Production
by  Brian Higgins  and some catchy choruses don’t save her.  Rating: **.  The Beach Boys are on Capitol, Beach House on Sub Pop and
Garbage on Sony, with Patti Smith, Gossip and Dexys all on
Columbia. They’re out in the U.S. apart from Dexys, on import
from the U.K. and released in America on June 12.  Information:  http://dexys.info ,  http://garbage.com ,
