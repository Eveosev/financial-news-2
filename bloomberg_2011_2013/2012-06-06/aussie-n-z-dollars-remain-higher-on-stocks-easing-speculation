Australia’s dollar erased declines
against most major peers after a government report showed an
unexpected jump in employment.  The Aussie touched parity with the  U.S. dollar  as traders
trimmed bets the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will reduce borrowing
costs further after an interest-rate cut this week. The currency
dropped back below the greenback after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  refrained from signaling additional steps the
central bank might take to spur growth during congressional
testimony.  New Zealand’s dollar, known as the kiwi, remained higher
after gaining yesterday by the most this year amid speculation
that Bernanke would identify the need for further stimulus.  Australia’s jobs report was “quite a bullish outcome,”
said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist in Singapore at
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  “The risks are you see the market
probably price out further RBA rate cuts from here, so naturally
the Aussie dollar can probably find a little bit more support.”  Australia’s currency climbed 0.1 percent to 99.36 U.S.
cents as of 10:58 a.m. in New York after touching $1.003 and
falling as much as 0.5 percent. It advanced 0.6 percent to 79.09
yen.  The kiwi added 0.1 percent to 77.13 U.S. cents and 0.6
percent to 61.39 yen. Both South Pacific nations’ currencies
surged 1.9 percent against the greenback yesterday, the most
since Nov. 30.  Equity Advance  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares advanced 1.4 percent,
bolstering investor appetite for riskier assets.  Australian  payrolls  jumped by 38,900 in May, the statistics
bureau said today, while economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
forecast no change. The jobless rate rose to 5.1 percent from a
revised 5 percent in April as participation increased.  The data followed an official report yesterday that showed
the nation’s gross domestic product expanded 1.3 percent in the
first three months of this year from the fourth quarter, twice
the pace economists estimated.  Traders bet the RBA will cut  interest rates  by 93 basis
points in the next 12 months, down from 156 basis points of
easing signaled on June 4, according to a  gauge  compiled by
Credit Suisse Group AG based on overnight-index swap rates.  Australian bonds fell, pushing the yield on 10-year
securities up by seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point,
to 3.07 percent.  The central bank reduced its benchmark rate by 25 basis
points to 3.5 percent on June 5, following a cut of 50 basis
points in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
