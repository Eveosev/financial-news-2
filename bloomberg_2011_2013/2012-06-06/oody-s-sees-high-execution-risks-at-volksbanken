Moody’s Investors Service said it
sees “high execution risks” at  Oesterreichische Volksbanken
AG (VBPS) , as the Austrian lender tries to restructure following its
partially nationalized.  “We are seeing how far the cross-guarantee system will
stabilize the bank’s rating,” Mathias Kuelpmann, an analyst at
Moody’s, said in a telephone interview today. Moody’s put
Volksbanken on review to downgrade in February and may cut its
Baa2 rating by one level to the lowest investment grade, he
said.  Austria agreed to take a 43 percent in the lender this year
in Volksbanken’s third bailout since 2008, while a group of 62
regional banks still own its majority. The  cross-guarantee pact
would combine Volksbanken’s and the regional lenders’ capital
and liabilities and is part of that bailout. Volksbanken, which
already sold its east Europe business to OAO Sberbank, is also
trying to shed “non-core” assets.  “We have to examine what the situation at Volksbanken
looks like after the revamp,” Kuelpmann said. “Because of the
big restructuring need, we see high execution risks.”  While Moody’s normally tries to complete a review within
three months, Volksbanken’s reorganization is delaying this
process, Kuelpmann said, without saying when it may be
completed.  Editor: To contact the reporter on this story:
