Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose for a fifth day on speculation falling money-market rates
are boosting demand for government debt. The dong weakened.  The overnight  interbank deposit rate  declined 15 basis
points to 1.22 percent, the lowest level since June 2009 when
Bloomberg started compiling the data. The measure, which was at
11.81 percent at the end of 2011, has fallen more than 300 basis
points in the last month.  “Liquidity in the money market is good, supporting the
trend lower,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based fixed-income
trader at Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam.  Five-year bond yields fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 9.53 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest since
May 21.  The dong dropped 0.3 percent to 21,005 per dollar as of
2:11 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
