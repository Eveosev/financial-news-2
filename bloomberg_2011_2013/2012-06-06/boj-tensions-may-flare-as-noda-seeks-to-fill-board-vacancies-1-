Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  will
resume efforts to fill two vacant seats on the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
board, two months after lawmakers blocked the appointment of BNP
Paribas SA economist  Ryutaro Kono .  Noda aims to nominate candidates during the current
parliamentary session, ending June 21, Chief Cabinet Secretary
Osamu Fujimura told reporters today in Tokyo.  Some lawmakers in the ruling and opposition parties are
urging the central bank to take a more aggressive approach to
monetary easing to boost growth and tame decade-long deflation.
The appointment process will give them a platform for airing
their concerns, adding to pressure on Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
to take bolder steps.  “We really don’t know if the process of nominations will
go through smoothly after the failure in April,” said  Hideo
Kumano , chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in
Tokyo and a former central bank official. “As long as Japan’s
economy is surrounded by myriad uncertainties, political
pressure on the BOJ will remain high.”  The positions have been vacant since April 4, when the
terms of the previous members expired. The board has nine seats,
including the governor and two deputy governors.  After his rejection, Kono said that some politicians were
pushing economic policies “entirely divorced from reality” and
making “unrealistic” demands on monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
