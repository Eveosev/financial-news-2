Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s largest oil
producer, said it would be unable to fly about 1,500 workers to
its offshore platforms as an escalating pay strike by airport
security personnel is grounding helicopters.  Three out of five heliports Statoil uses will be closed
tomorrow, limiting take-offs to 11, spokesman Ola Anders Skauby
said. That’s compared with the usual 50 to 60 return flights
necessary to ensure personnel rotation on about 40 offshore
installations.  “Tomorrow we will have a situation that’s a little more
challenging,” he said by phone, after a union representing
security personnel said it would take an additional 106 workers
off the job in a fourth day of strikes at Norwegian airports.  It’s the second time in as many weeks that Statoil is
affected by labor conflicts in  Norway , after a now resolved
strike by pilot boat workers last week threatened output.  The company will be able to keep oil and gas output at
normal levels “for the time being,” Skauby said. “We are
working with a short time perspective, following the situation
from one day to the other, and we won’t speculate on when the
effect would be more than personnel not rotating as planned.”  Rotations were one day behind schedule after three days of
the strike, and operations on Statoil’s platforms were “near
normal,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
