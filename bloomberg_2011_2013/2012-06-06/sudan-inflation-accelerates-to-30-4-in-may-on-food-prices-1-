Sudanese inflation accelerated to
30.4 percent in May as food prices increased, the  Central Bureau
of Statistics  said.  The inflation rate climbed from 28.6 percent in the
previous month, the Khartoum-based agency said in an e-mailed
statement today. Prices rose 3.9 percent in the month, it said.  The cost of food and drinks, the biggest component in the
consumer price index, rose 5.5 percent in the month as sugar,
corn and red meat costs increased as much as 12 percent, the
agency said.  Sudan is targeting an inflation rate of below 17 percent
this year, Finance Minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel Rasoul said in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
