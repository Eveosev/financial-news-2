China announced a second batch of 64
energy-saving vehicles that qualify for lower taxes, with
refunds payable to people who have bought the cars since Jan. 1,
Xinhua reported , citing a government document.  The government will cut taxes paid by buyers of these
vehicles in half, and will eliminate fees for users of seven
types of electric automobiles, Xinhua said, citing the document
from the finance and industry ministries and the tax agency.  At least 10 domestic automakers including Chery Automobile
Co. and  Yangzhou Yaxing Motor Coach Co. (600213)  are on the list, Xinhua
said. The government first applied the policy in March to at
least 200 eligible vehicles, including hybrid cars, pure
electric cars and fuel-cell vehicles, Xinhua said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
