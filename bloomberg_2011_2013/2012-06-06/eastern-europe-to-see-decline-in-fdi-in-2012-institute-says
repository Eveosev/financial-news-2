Inflows of foreign direct investment
to the 22 countries of eastern  Europe  will fall this year as
growth slows in western Europe, according to the Vienna
Institute for International Economic Studies.  “On average, FDI flows are forecast to be 3 percent lower
than in 2011,” the institute said in an e-mailed report today.
“Expectations are supported by plummeting first-quarter FDI
flows and greenfield projects.”  While the euro region narrowly avoided recession in the
first quarter, latest data suggest its economy is shrinking
again. The Group of Seven nations agreed yesterday to coordinate
their response to Europe’s turmoil, which has put at least eight
of the 17 euro-area members into recession and damped European
demand for foreign goods.  The projected decline in FDI in eastern Europe this year
comes after investment rose 26 percent in 2011 to 96 billion
euros ($120 billion), which was still below the peak years for
the region of 2006-2008, the institute said.  “Large countries like Russia, Turkey and  Kazakhstan 
received the major part of the recent FDI boom, though Hungary,
Serbia and Slovakia also significantly improved their
positions,” the institute said in the report.  The share of investment in manufacturing for the region is
declining, while growing in finance and business services.
Financial flows that are used for tax optimization have become a
major part of investment.  “As an extreme example, about two-thirds of Russian FDI
inflows and outflows are to and from Cyprus and other  tax
havens ,” the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
