Egypt â€™s wheat production climbed to
9.5 million metric tons in the 2011-2012 growing season from
about 7 million tons a year earlier, Prime Minister Kamal el- Ganzouri said.  The government had bought 2.8 million metric tons through
yesterday from domestic growers at a cost of 6.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($1.1 billion), el-Ganzouri said today at a
Cairo press conference. The government was expected to buy 3.5
million metric tons this growing season, he said, compared with
2.1 million tons for the 2010-2011 season.  While the government had budgeted 40 billion pounds for
fuel subsidies from December through May, the actual outlay
amounted to 59 billion Egyptian pounds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
