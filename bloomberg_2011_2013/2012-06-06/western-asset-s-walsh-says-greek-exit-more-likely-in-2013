A Greek exit from the euro region is
more likely to happen next year than this year, according to
 Steve Walsh , chief investment officer for Western Asset
Management Co.  “The more likely scenario is that an exit would occur in
2013 as the populace finally rejects the austerity thrust upon
it,” Walsh said in an e-mail. A Greek exit in 2013 would be
more orderly because it would give institutions and investors
time to prepare, he said.  If Greece leaves the euro this year, it will be a more
chaotic exit, with a more forceful policy response from the
 European Central Bank  and the rest of the  euro-zone  countries in
an attempt to suppress the contagion, Walsh said. The response
could take the form of more long-term refinancing operations or
interest-rate cuts, he said.  Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said earlier this week
there’s at least a one-in-three chance of Greece exiting the
euro zone in the coming months, following national elections
June 17.  Western Asset, the Pasadena, California-based bond unit of
Legg Mason Inc., has about $447 billion in assets under
management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
