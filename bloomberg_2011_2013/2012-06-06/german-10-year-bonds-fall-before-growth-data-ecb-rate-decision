German bonds fell, pushing up 10-year
yields by the most in eight weeks, as speculation European
policy makers are accelerating plans to stem the spread of the
debt crisis damped demand for the safest assets.  Spain’s 10-year bonds climbed for a fifth day after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said officials
stand ready to act as the region’s growth outlook worsens. Two-
year German yields jumped from as low as 0.002 percent after the
central bank left its benchmark  interest rate  at 1 percent, as
predicted by most economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  There’s “wishful thinking that a big coordinated response
lies around the corner,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. “Today’s
move is little more than covering of risk-off positions and
taking profit” after last month’s rally in German securities,
he said.  German 10-year yields rose 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 1.32 percent at 4:27 p.m.  London  time.
That’s the biggest increase since April 11. The 1.75 percent
securities maturing in July 2022 dropped 1.10, or 11 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,251) face amount, to 104.005.  Two-year rates climbed five basis points to 0.06 percent.  Draghi said the ECB would extend its offerings of three-
month unlimited cash into next year. He also said he’s on a
working group looking at the euro’s future. European
representatives on a conference call of Group of Seven finance
ministers and central bank governors yesterday “said they will
speed up their efforts to resolve” the debt crisis, Japanese
Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  told reporters in  Tokyo .  Spanish Notes  Bunds are falling on reports of a “master-plan that will
see greater fiscal integration and more growth measures,” said
Norbert Aul, a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada
in London.  Spanish two-year notes advanced for a third day even after
a report showed the nation’s industrial production fell the most
in more than two years in April and after Draghi indicated
another round of three-year funding for banks wasn’t imminent.  The yield on the securities tumbled 17 basis points to 4.55
percent. The nation’s 10-year rate declined three basis points
to 6.28 percent.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days slid 8.3 percent from a year earlier, the
biggest contraction since October 2009, the National Statistics
Institute in  Madrid  said today. German industrial production
fell 2.2 percent in April from the previous month, the Economy
Ministry in Berlin said.  German Auction  Germany ’s  borrowing costs  plunged to record lows on June 1
as investors sought the nation’s debt as a haven from  Europe ’s
financial turmoil after Spanish yields surged and concern
mounted that  Greece  will exit the euro area.  Gross domestic
product  in the 17-nation euro region was unchanged in the three
months through March, after contracting 0.3 percent in the
fourth quarter, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today.  Germany’s  five-year  borrowing costs fell to an all-time low
of 0.41 percent today at an auction of 3.98 billion euros of
notes due in April 2017 today. The government received bids for
6.2 billion euros of the securities, compared with a maximum
sales target of 5 billion euros, according to a statement from
the Bundesbank.  The five-year yield increased nine basis points to 0.47
percent. It slid to a record 0.30 percent last week.  Italy’s two-year note yield dropped 17 basis points to 3.91
percent.  Danish Volatility  Volatility on Danish  government bonds  was the highest in
developed markets today, according to measures of 10-year bonds,
two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  Denmark sold 3.35 billion kroner ($560 million) of its 3
percent bond due 2021 at a yield of 1.04 percent versus 1.51
percent on May 8, the Copenhagen-based central bank said today
in a statement.  The yield on Portuguese two-year notes plunged 65 basis
points to 10.32 percent as the nation’s borrowing costs fell at
a sale of 1.5 billion euros of six- and 12-month bills.  Spain  is scheduled to sell bonds maturing in October 2014,
October 2016 and January 2022 tomorrow, while  France  plans to
auction securities due between 2019 and 2060.  German debt has returned 4.8 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities have lost 3.7
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
