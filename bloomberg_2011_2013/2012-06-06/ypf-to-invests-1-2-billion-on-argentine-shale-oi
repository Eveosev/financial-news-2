YPF SA (YPF) ,  Argentina ’s largest oil
producer, will invest $1.2 billion in shale oil next year as it
seeks to boost crude output after the government nationalized
the company and opposed dividend payments.  YPF will invest a total of $7 billion in 2013 as it plans
to double exploration in five years and boost refining, Chief
Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio said at a press conference in
 Buenos Aires  yesterday. YPF will drill 1,019 wells in 2013, up
from 746 this year, including 132 shale  oil wells  and 14 shale
gas wells, according to a presentation filed with Argentina’s
stock exchange.  Argentina  seized control  of YPF in April and nationalized
51 percent of the company’s shares formerly owned by Madrid-
based Repsol SA. It seeks to halt declining oil and gas output
and stem fuel imports that doubled to $9.4 billion last year.
President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government is seeking
to tap shale reserves that may hold at least 23 billion barrels
of oil equivalent, according to a Ryder Scott audit.  A month before seizing control, the government with its one
YPF board seat voted against a  semi-annual dividend payment  of
$650 million and said the money should be reinvested. The
government also opposed last year’s YPF dividend payments of
about $1.3 billion, which weren’t distributed.  Increasing YPF’s oil production will help make Argentina a
net exporter of crude, Galuccio said. YPF’s shale discovery in
Patagonia in southern Argentina is the company’s largest ever.  Increasing Production  YPF will also lease 20 additional rigs in 2013, after using
an estimated 38 this year, the company said in its filing. YPF
will seek to increase oil and gas production by 6 percent
annually by 2017, Galuccio said.  YPF on June 4 appointed a new  17-member board , in which
Repsol’s representative Luis Garcia del Rio is the sole minority
stakeholder member. Repsol, which holds a 12 percent stake in
YPF, said the nationalization was illegal.  Fernandez picked former  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  executive
Galuccio to run YPF after ousting the previous management,
including Chairman  Antonio Brufau  and Chief Executive Officer
Sebastian Eskenazi. The government has said that Repsol under-
invested since it acquired YPF in 1999.  YPF’s American depositary receipts gained 5.1 percent to
$12.69 at 10:19 a.m. in  New York . The ADRs have plunged 63
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
