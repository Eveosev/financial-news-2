Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  rose the most
in two weeks after the operator of namesake and Anthropologie
stores said it has room to grow in  Europe .  Urban Outfitters rose 89 cents, or more than 3.3 percent,
to $27.59 in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. It’s the
company’s biggest share rise in two weeks. Shares in the
Philadelphia-based apparel and household-merchandise seller have
fallen 4.5 percent in the last five months.  Urban Outfitters may increase its namesake stores to 100 in
Europe, from 30 now, Chief Financial Officer Frank Conforti said
today during a conference hosted by Piper Jaffray in New York.
Conforti also sees growth in the region for Anthropologie. He
didn’t give a timetable for that growth.  Last month, Urban Outfitters officials said first-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates on record sales. Net income in
the three months ended April 30 fell to $34 million, or 23 cents
a share,  from  $38.6 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier,
according to a statement from the company. Analysts had
projected 20 cents, the average of 28 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Urban Outfitters is attempting a rebound after profit for
the year ended Jan. 31 shrank to a four-year low as the chain
boosted discounts to clear inventory. The company has had new
management in place since November, with Richard Hayne
succeeding former CEO Glen Senk, former Under Armour Inc.
executive David McCreight joining as CEO of the Anthropologie
brand, and Ted Marlow returning as head of the namesake Urban
Outfitters label.  To contact the reporter on this story:
