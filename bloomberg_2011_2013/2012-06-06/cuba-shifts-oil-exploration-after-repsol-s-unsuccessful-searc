Cuba began exploring for oil at
another offshore site after a first attempt by  Spain ’s  Repsol
YPF SA (REP)  proved unsuccessful.  A subsidiary of Kuala Lumpur-based Petroliam Nasional Bhd.,
or Petronas, started drilling for oil off Cuba’s northern coast
on May 24 with the same Scarabeo-9 rig Repsol had used,
according to a  statement  today by Cubapetroleo in government-run
newspaper Granma.  Petroleos de Venezuela SA  will begin exploring for oil
following the drilling by Petronas, Cubapetroleo said in the
statement. Repsol spokesman Kristian Rix said May 18 that the
company was abandoning its wells off the Cuban coast because
they weren’t successful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
