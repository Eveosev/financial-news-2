Mauritius plans to almost triple its
imports of raw sugar for refining and re-exporting, L’Express
reported, citing Jean-Noel Humbert, chief executive officer of
the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate.  The syndicate will import three shipments totaling 75,000
metric tons of raw sugar this year, compared with 26,000 tons in
2011, Humbert said, according to a transcript of an interview
published today by the Port Louis-based newspaper.  The shipments will help to compensate for a local
production deficit in the Indian Ocean island nation, Humbert
said. Output of the sweetener is forecast to decline 5.8 percent
from a year earlier to 410,000 tons in 2012 as unfavorable
weather hampers cane growth, the country’s Chamber of
Agriculture said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
