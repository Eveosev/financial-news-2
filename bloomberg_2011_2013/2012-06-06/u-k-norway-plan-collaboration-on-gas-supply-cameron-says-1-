Norway and the U.K. are planning a
“new energy partnership” that envisages reciprocal oil and gas
investments, British Prime Minister  David Cameron  told
journalists in Oslo today.  He also said Europe needs structural reform to return to
growth and that the “Greek issue” must be resolved
conclusively. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  shouldn’t be
expected to resolve the euro-region crisis on her own, Cameron
said at the joint press conference with Norwegian Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg.  “I don’t think we should single out one euro-zone leader
and put all the responsibility on them,,” Cameron said.
“There’s a whole series of steps that need to be taken. We’ve
always said there’s some urgent action that needs to be taken to
stabilize markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
