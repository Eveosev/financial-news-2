Taiwan’s dollar rebounded from the
lowest level in almost five months and bonds declined after the
Group of Seven nations agreed to coordinate their response to
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  Finance ministers and central bank governors from the G7
said they will work together to help Greece and  Spain  place
their public finances on a sustainable footing after a
conference call yesterday, Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi 
told reporters in  Tokyo . Taiwan’s  five-year  yields advanced for
a second day after official data yesterday showed  consumer
prices  rose 1.74 percent from a year earlier in May, compared
with an increase of 1.44 percent in April.  “There’s some optimism again that these countries will get
their acts together and tackle the crisis,” said Eric Hsing, a
bond trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “There still
continues to be worries about  Taiwan ’s rising consumer prices.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.935
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$30.070 yesterday, the weakest level since Jan. 17.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
traders use to price options, fell 16 basis points to 5.64
percent.  Exports slumped 5.3 percent in May from a year earlier, a
third monthly contraction, analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated before official data due tomorrow.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.94
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. It reached 0.91
percent on June 4, the lowest level for benchmark five-year
rates since October 2010.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.51 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
