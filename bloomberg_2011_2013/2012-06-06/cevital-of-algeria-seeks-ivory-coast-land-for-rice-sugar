Cevital,  Algeria ’s biggest sugar
producer, asked  Ivory Coast ’s government to make land available
for the production of rice, sugar, maize and vegetable oil,
according to a company official.  The Algiers-based company, Algeria’s only private sugar
refinery, wants to invest $1 billion in the West African nation
over the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Issad Rebrab
told reporters in the commercial capital, Abidjan, yesterday.  “We’d like Ivory Coast to be our logistical hub in West
Africa, using the western port of San Pedro,” he said. “So far
we have always reinvested our revenues in Algeria but we are
ready to grow rice, sugar and maize in Ivory Coast.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
