Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the third-biggest
mining company, said it’s advancing a study into developing an
Indian iron ore mine as demand for steel in the country grows.  The world’s second-biggest iron ore exporter is considering
an operation to produce an initial 3 million metric tons of the
steelmaking raw material, with potential for expansion to at
least 20 million tons a year, said Alan Davies, president of
international operations for Rio’s iron ore unit.  The proposal is subject to board approval, Davies said in a
presentation on Rio’s  website .  “We will be the first global miner directly participating
in  India ’s mining sector,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
