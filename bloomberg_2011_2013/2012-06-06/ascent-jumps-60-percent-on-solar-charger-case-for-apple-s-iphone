Ascent Solar Technologies Inc. (ASTI) , a
thin-film solar panels, rose the most in nine months after it
announced a solar-powered charger case for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone.  Ascent, based in Thornton, Colorado, rose 48 percent to 86
cents at the close in New York, the most since August 15.  The case, under Ascent’s new EnerPlex line of solar power
consumer products, consists of a battery paired with the
company’s copper-indium-gallium-selenide, or CIGS, thin-film
solar cells, Ascent said today in a statement.  The EnerPlex line will provide mobile phone users with a
product that “prolongs battery life, increases mobility and
allows them to be ‘green’,” Victor Lee, chief executive officer
of Ascent said in the statement. The company also expects to
release a similar case for Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy S
III phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
