Kenya closed its main airport in the
capital, Nairobi, after an  Egypt  Air plane veered off the runway
as it was landing earlier today,  Kenya Airports Authority  said.  “An Egypt Air plane was coming to land at 3:36 a.m. and it
veered off the runway and in line with normal measures flights
have been diverted,” Dominic Ngigi, a spokesman for the
authority, said in a phone interview today from the city. No one
was injured in the incident, he said.  Workers at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport are removing
the aircraft from the runway and all take-offs and landings have
been canceled until clearance has been obtained from the Kenya
Civil Aviation Authority to reopen the airport, Ngigi said.  Kenya Airways Ltd., (KNAL)  sub-Saharan  Africa ’s third biggest
carrier, diverted seven incoming flights to Moi International
Airport in the port city of Mombasa, four to Entebbe
International Airport in Uganda and one to Julius Nyerere
International Airport in Dar-es-salam, Tanzania, it said in an
e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
