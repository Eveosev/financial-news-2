Reykjavik’s District Court rejected a
motion by  Credit Suisse International (CSGN)  to gain priority for a
24.3 million euros ($30.4 million) claim in the wind-up process
of failed Icelandic lender Kaupthing Bank hf.  Kaupthing failed with the rest of Iceland’s largest lenders
in October 2008 after it was unable to secure short-term
financing. Credit Suisse’s claim was classified as a
“remainder” claim by the caretakers of Kaupthing and the bank
sued, demanding a re-classification to gain a higher priority in
the process.  The Swiss bank’s claim was denied since the terms of the
bonds in question “clearly state that they are subordinate to
all other claims” according to the  ruling .  To contact the reporter on this story:
