Colombian Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said inflation will slow toward the
government’s 3 percent target this year even after consumer
prices rose faster than expected last month.  Consumer prices  rose  0.3 percent in May, the statistics
agency said yesterday, more than the 0.2 percent median forecast
of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The result put the
annual rate at 3.44 percent.  Inflation is at “a reasonable level,” Echeverry told
reporters in Bogota yesterday after a hearing with lawmakers.
“We think inflation will slow toward 3 percent during the rest
of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
