Cotton production in  Tanzania , East
Africa’s biggest producer, may climb in 2012-13 for a second
successive season after the country introduced contract farming
and on improved weather, the Tanzania Cotton Board said.  Lint cotton output for marketing in the 12 months through
June may rise to more than 300,000 metric tons from 225,000 tons
this year, Director-General Marco Mtunga said. Production in
2011-12 is estimated to be 38 percent more than last season’s
crop of 163,000 tons, he said.  “We expect a big crop of 300,000 tons or even more than
that,” Mtunga said by phone yesterday from  Dar es Salaam , the
commercial capital. “We’ve got favorable weather conditions and
we’ve even started implementing contract farming.”  Tanzania exports at least 70 percent of its annual crop
mainly to the U.K., Switzerland,  Belgium , Malaysia, Singapore,
the United Arab Emirates, China and  Kenya , according to the
board. The nation plans to boost domestic consumption of the
crop to 51 percent in three years, according to its  website .  The forecast for next season is above the 271,000-ton
target the board set two years ago for 2014-15. With the advent
of contract farming, growers will agree with buyers to supply
certain quantities of specific qualities of the crop, usually at
predetermined prices, according to the board. That, together
with improving productivity and increasing credit to farmers, is
expected to boost output, according to the board.  Harvesting of next season’s crop will start later this
month, with marketing expected to start in July, Mtunga said.  GMO Trials  The board’s plans to start confined trials of genetically
modified cotton are still on hold because “regulations are not
ready yet,” Mtunga said, without providing more details.  Tanzania, which produces the medium-fiber variety of
cotton, plants the crop in its western region in November to
January and then reaps it from June through August, while the
eastern region plants in January to March and harvests from
August to October, according to the board. The country’s cotton
marketing season runs from July 1 through June, it says.  As many as 500,000 Tanzanian farmers cultivate about
485,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of cotton in the country’s
northern, coastal and western regions, the board said.  Tanzania vies with  Benin  to be  Africa ’s sixth-biggest
cotton producer, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . Mali is the continent’s largest grower.  Cotton for December delivery climbed 3 percent to 67.29
cents a pound at 10:55 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
