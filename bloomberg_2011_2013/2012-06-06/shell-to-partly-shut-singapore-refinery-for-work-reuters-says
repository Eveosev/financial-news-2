Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will partially
shut its 500,000 barrel-a-day Pulau Bukom refinery in  Singapore 
for a month starting in early July for maintenance,  Reuters 
reported, citing five unidentified traders.  The company will idle a 110,000 barrel-a-day crude
distillation unit, it said, citing two of the traders. Work will
also be done on a 35,000 barrel-a-day hydrocracker, a reformer
unit and another secondary unit, Reuters said, citing one
person.  Shell does not discuss maintenance schedules, the company
said in an e-mailed statement seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
