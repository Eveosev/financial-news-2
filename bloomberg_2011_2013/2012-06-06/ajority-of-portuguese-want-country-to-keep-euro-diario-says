A majority of Portuguese want the
country to remain in the euro,  Diario de Noticias  reported
today, citing a poll.  The survey indicated four in five Portuguese back the euro
and 21 percent believe it is not likely at all that Portugal
will end up in the same situation as Greece. The poll also shows
24 percent believe it is very probable that Portugal will seek a
second bailout and 35 percent say it’s quite probable, the
Portuguese newspaper said.  The poll was carried out by the Center for Public Opinion
Polls and Studies of Portugal’s  Catholic University  from May 26
to 28, the newspaper said. The margin of error is 2.7 percent,
Diario de Noticias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
