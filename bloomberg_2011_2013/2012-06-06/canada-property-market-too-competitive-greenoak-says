Canada ’s commercial-property market
is less appealing than “recovering” areas such as the U.S. and
Asia as investors compete for assets, said Sonny Kalsi, founder
and partner of GreenOak Real Estate LP.  “Canada’s a little bit too competitive and a little bit
too expensive,” Kalsi said today during a speech in Toronto
hosted by Queen’s University. “The U.S. is in a recovery,
though it’s a challenged recovery.”  The commercial real estate market in major Canadian cities
is dominated by investments from retirement funds such as Canada
Pension Plan Investment Board and firms including  Brookfield
Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A) , as well as real estate investment trusts.
GreenOak is focused on investing in office properties in the
U.S. and  Japan , and plans to add real estate assets in China,
 India  and  Europe  in the next five years.  “Canada is a relatively small country, and within that
there are only a few cities where people really want to be,”
Kalsi, the former head of real estate for Morgan Stanley, said
after the speech. “The country’s got a fair amount of capital
-- private-sector capital, public-sector capital, so whether
it’s Brookfield or CPP, there’s a lot of money here. It makes it
that much harder for a foreigner to come in.”  Canada has also fared well with its REITs, Kalsi said in
his presentation. Canadian REITs have outperformed their U.S.
counterparts by almost 13 percent on average since January 2008,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
