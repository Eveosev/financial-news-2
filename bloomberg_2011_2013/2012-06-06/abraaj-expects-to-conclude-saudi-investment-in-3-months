Abraaj Capital Ltd., the biggest
private equity firm in the  Middle East , may conclude an
investment in  Saudi Arabia  within three months and is looking at
a “number of deals” in  Turkey , a senior official said.  “For at least one of them we expect it will be fairly
imminent,” Chief Executive Officer Mustafa Abdel Wadood said in
an interview at the  World Economic Forum  in Istanbul. “I would
like to think within the next two to three months.”  The Dubai-based company is in talks on three investments in
Saudi Arabia valued as much as $150 million each, Ahmed Badreldin, a senior partner, said in April. Abraaj oversees
about $7.5 billion across more than 30 emerging market
countries. The private equity firm agreed in February to buy
London-based Aureos Capital Ltd., which specializes in investing
in small- and medium-sized firms.  Abraaj is also looking to invest in Turkey after it sold
its 50 percent stake in the nation’s largest hospital chain,
Abdel Wadood said. “If anything, we would like to get more
exposure there and we are looking at a number of sectors and
there are a number of deals that we’re active in an looking
at.”  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  and Abraaj placed binding bids for ATV
television channel owned by Istanbul-based Calik Holding AS, two
people with direct knowledge of the situation said last month.
Abdel Wadood declined to comment on it.  The firm has yet to set a time for a possible initial
public offering of its shares, he said. “Would it make sense at
one point in time? Yes! But there is no urgency or specific
need.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
