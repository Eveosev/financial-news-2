The International Renewable Energy
Agency  said the United Nation’s goal of providing sustainable
energy for all by 2030 may create up to 4 million jobs in the
off-grid electricity industry alone.  The renewable energy companies currently employ 5 million
people, Rabia Ferroukhi, senior programme officer at Irena’s
Policy Advice and Capacity Building Directorate, said at a press
conference in  Abu Dhabi  today.  “There is considerable employment potential in the
downstream linkages, particularly in the distribution, sales,
installation, operation and service of such systems, which can
be enhanced if well integrated with local commercial
activities,” said Adnan Z. Amin, Irena’s director-general.  Of the 1.3 billion people who lack access to electricity,
45 percent live in Africa and 50 percent in  Asia , Irena said in
a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
