UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s biggest
bank, forecast savings of 725 million euros ($961 million) in 10
years from a joint venture with  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  to outsource information-technology systems.  “UniCredit’s partnership will allow the bank to have
significant savings at not material costs,” UniCredit Deputy
General Manager Paolo Fiorentino said at a press conference in
Milan today.  Value Transformation Services, the joint venture in which
IBM holds a 51 percent stake, will operate in Italy, Germany,
Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, he said.
Milan-based UniCredit will transfer 700 workers to the new
venture as part of the agreement.  UniCredit and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, agreed in
July to improve the bank’s infrastructure services as part of a
plan, dubbed Newton Program, to cut costs and increase revenue
through strategic partnerships. UniCredit Chief Executive
Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  said last month he plans to reduce
costs by 1 billion euros more than the 15.8 billion euros
previously targeted by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
