The real advanced to its highest
level in a month as  China , Brazil’s biggest trading partner,
bolstered the central bank’s efforts to support the currency.  The real climbed for a fourth straight day, gaining 0.1
percent to 2.2731 per  U.S. dollar  at 10:07 a.m. in  Sao Paulo ,
the strongest level on a closing basis since Aug. 9. Swap rates
on the contract due in January 2015 rose six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 10.35 percent after a report showed
higher-than-forecast inflation.  The currency appreciated as China’s industrial output grew
at the fastest pace in 17 months in August, boosting trade
prospects for the Latin American nation. Brazil’s central bank
sold $497 million of foreign-exchange swap contracts today, part
of a $60 billion intervention program to support the real
announced last month.  “We’re having a series of good economic indicators,
principally from China,”  Francisco Carvalho , currency director
at Liquidez Dtvm in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.
“The central bank is continuing its swap auctions even with the
dollar falling.”  The IGP-M inflation index of wholesale, construction and
consumer prices increased 1.02 percent in the 10 days beginning
Aug. 21, the Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today. The
median forecast of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
0.67 percent increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
