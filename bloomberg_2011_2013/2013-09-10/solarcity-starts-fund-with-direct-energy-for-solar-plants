SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the third-largest
U.S. solar company, will start a fund with Centrica Plc’s  Direct
Energy  unit to finance as much as $124 million of projects.  The fund will make solar power available for Direct
Energy’s business customers at little or no upfront cost, the
companies said today in a joint statement. Direct Energy, which
provides electricity and related services in 14 U.S. states and
Canada, will finance as much as $50 million of the total.  The agreement is a rare example of a renewable-energy
company and a retail electricity supplier joining to fund
projects. Many conventional power suppliers in the U.S. are
lobbying to cut support for solar generation, arguing that it
pushes up costs for customers that don’t use the technology.  SolarCity rose 22 percent to $36.58 at the close in New
York, the most since May 17. The shares have quadrupled since
trading began in December.  Following the agreement, many Direct Energy customers will
pay less for clean power than they do for electricity from
fossil fuels now, according to  San Mateo , California-based
SolarCity.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and  SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  are the largest U.S.
solar companies by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
