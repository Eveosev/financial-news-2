Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  has
delayed the start of maintenance on a fluid catalytic cracker at
the Catlettsburg,  Kentucky , refinery from this week to Sept. 15,
according to a person familiar with the work.  Maintenance on the unit is scheduled to last about 40 days,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  Fluid catalytic crackers process vacuum gasoil into higher-value gasoline and other lighter products.  Jamal Kheiry, spokesman for Marathon in Findlay, Ohio,
declined to comment on operations.  The  Catlettsburg refinery , in northeastern Kentucky on the
Big Sandy River, has a capacity of 240,000 barrels a day. The
plant processes a wide range of both sweet and sour crude oils
and distributes products by pipeline, barge, truck and rail,
according to Marathon’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
