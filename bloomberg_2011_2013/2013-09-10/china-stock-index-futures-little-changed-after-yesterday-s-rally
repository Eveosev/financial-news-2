China’s stocks  rose, with trading
volumes on the benchmark index jumping to the highest levels
since October 2010, as better-than-estimated industrial
production data signaled a turning point for the economy.  Citic Securities Co., the nation’s biggest-listed
brokerage, posted its biggest two-day gain in five years.  China
Eastern (600115)  Airlines Corp. and China Shipping Container Lines Co.
jumped 9.9 percent, leading a rally for industrial shares on
speculation the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone will turn the city into
a global shipping hub.  Guangzhou Shipyard International Co. (600685) 
gained 6.5 percent after the South China Morning Post reported
 Guangdong province  is studying a plan to create a trade zone.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 1.2 percent to 2,237.98
at the close, the highest level since June 6. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  climbed 1.2 percent, rebounding 20
percent from a June 25 low. China’s industrial output gained
10.4 percent last month, compared with the estimate for 9.9
percent growth in a Bloomberg News survey.  The economic data “show the recovery is well on track,”
said Dai Ming, a  money manager  at Hengsheng Hongding Asset
Management Co. “Investors’ expectations about stronger growth
are building up.”  Trading volumes on the Shanghai Composite surged to 23.7
billion, the highest level since Oct. 18, 2010. Citic Securities
led gains for brokerages on speculation increased trading will

two-day gain of 18 percent. Haitong Securities Co., the second-biggest brokerage, added 3.5 percent to 13.03  yuan .  Economic Outlook  The CSI 300 Index advanced 1.4 percent to 2,474.89. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index, the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 1.8 percent in New York
yesterday. The Shanghai Composite is  valued  at 9 times its
projected 12-month earnings, the highest since June 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Shanghai index has risen 15 percent since reaching this
year’s low on June 27 as data ranging from exports to
manufacturing and money supply signaled the economy is
stabilizing. An official manufacturing gauge jumped to a 16-month high in August. A report last weekend showed exports rose
7.2 percent in August, beating estimates.  The advance in industrial production compared with a 9.7
percent increase in July, according to the National Bureau of
Statistics. Retail sales gained 13.4 percent, compared with the
median analyst projection for a 13.3 percent advance. Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households in the first eight

strengthening and this added to the momentum in the market,”
said Li Lei, an analyst at China Minzu Securities Co. in
Beijing. “The optimism towards the Shanghai free-trade zone
also spread from Shanghai-based companies to their peers such as
Air China.”  China announced last month its cabinet had approved the
plan to set up the first free-trade zone on 29 square kilometers
(11 square miles) in Shanghai, describing it as a crucial move
in adapting to global economic and trade development and the
opening up the world’s second-largest economy.  Guangdong Zone  China Shipping Container, the country’s second-largest

for preferred shares, the Shanghai Securities News reported
today, citing unidentified employees at the two banks.
