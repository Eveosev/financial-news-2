Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  declined the
most in almost 20 months after the teen-clothing retailer said
third-quarter comparable-store sales have been rising at a
“mid-single-digit” rate.  The  shares  slid 10 percent to $38.35 at the close in  New
York , their biggest drop since January 2012. The decline was
the largest today in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The stock
has fallen 2.6 percent this year, as the S&P 500 has gained
18 percent.  The operator of Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free
People stores made the comment yesterday in a U.S. regulatory
filing. Janney Montgomery Scott LLC last week estimated that the
Philadelphia-based retailer would report that the sales were
running at a “high-single digit” rate.  The company’s namesake division has seen weakness this
month and in August,  Adrienne Tennant , a Janney Montgomery
analyst, said today in a note. Urban Outfitters offered an
additional 30 percent off all clearance items during Labor Day
weekend, which didn’t occur last year, said Tennant, who has a
buy rating on the shares.  “We continue to believe the teen sector remains challenged
due to fierce competition to capture market share and highly
promotional environment,” she wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
