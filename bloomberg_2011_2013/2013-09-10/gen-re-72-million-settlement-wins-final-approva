General Reinsurance Corp.’s
$72 million settlement of investor claims that it participated
in a fraudulent transaction with  American International Group
Inc. (AIG)  was approved by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge  Deborah Batts  in Manhattan approved the
accord today. An appeals court last year reversed Batts’s
decision to block the 2009 settlement.  AIG investors, led by three Ohio public pension funds, sued
in 2004 alleging the companies were involved in a scheme in late
2000 and early 2001 that allowed New York-based AIG to
improperly inflate its revenue and loss reserves. Gen Re is a
unit of Warren Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire
Hathaway Inc.  “This is the last piece of the AIG litigation,” said
Thomas Dubbs, a lawyer for the investors. The Ohio Attorney
General’s office and the pension funds were pleased with Batts’s
ruling today, he said.  The case is In Re American International Group Inc.
Securities Litigation, 10-4401, U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
