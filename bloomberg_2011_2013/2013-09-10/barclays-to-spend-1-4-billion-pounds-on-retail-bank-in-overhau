Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive
Officer  Antony Jenkins  said he expects to spend about 1.4
billion pounds ($2.2 billion) by 2015 in an overhaul of the
consumer bank, about half the total cost of his revamp.  Britain’s second-largest lender by assets will spend about
600 million pounds on “rightsizing, industrialization and
innovation” in its investment bank, about 400 million pounds in
its wealth unit and more than 300 million pounds at the
corporate bank, London-based Barclays said in a statement today.  Barclays’s first-half profit was reduced by 640 million
pounds of restructuring costs linked to Jenkins’s attempts to
make the bank  more profitable . Under the plan announced in
February, the CEO pledged to save 1.7 billion pounds in expenses
by 2015, cut 3,700 jobs and reduce costs to about 55 percent of
income from 71 percent in the first quarter of 2013.  Jenkins, 52, who took over as CEO in August 2012 following
the resignation of  Robert Diamond  in the wake of the Libor
scandal, will give more details of his “Transform” program in
a speech in  New York  at about 12:45 p.m. local time today.  Barclays said in the statement it expects about 800 million
pounds of cost savings will come from operations and technology,
700 million pounds from the front office and 200 million pounds
from human resources, finance and risk.  The  shares  climbed 2.1 percent to 305.75 pence in London,
for a market value of about 39.3 billion pounds. They have
increased about 17 percent this year, making them the second-best performer among Britain’s five largest lenders after  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , which is up 63 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
