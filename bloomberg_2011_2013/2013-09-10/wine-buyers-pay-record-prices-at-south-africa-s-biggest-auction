South  Africa ’s biggest wine sale at
the  Nederburg  estate outside  Cape Town  saw prices almost double
to a record this month as volumes on offer fell.  Held on Sept. 6 and 7 at the estate in Paarl, northeast of
Cape Town, the auction offered 132 wines, including 72 red, 36
white and eight dessert varieties, the auctioneer said in a
 statement  on its website today. The average price per liter
climbed 92 percent to 354.64 rand ($35) from a year earlier, it
said.  “That’s a direct result of our tighter auction offering,”
Dalene Steyn, the auction’s manager, said in the statement.
“The buyers were far more informed, knew exactly what they
wanted to buy and were prepared to competitively bid on lots.”  The Nederburg auction started in 1975, with 15 wines on
show from five farms, and raised an average price per case of 19
rand. This year’s total sales amounted to 4.35 million rand and
the two biggest buyers were retailer  Spar Group Ltd. (SPP)  and Singita
Game Reserve, which manages luxury safari lodges in Africa,
according to the auctioneers. The highest price paid was 22,000
rand for three bottles of Zonnebloem Cabernet 1973 by Next
International Ltd. of  Nigeria .  Wine sales from the auction into the African continent rose
4.7 percent, Jan Scannell, managing director of  Distell Group
Ltd. (DST) , which owns Nederburg, said in the statement. International
sales outside Africa contributed 8.3 percent of the total, with
the biggest contribution came from the United Arab Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
