Thailand , the world’s largest
rubber producer and exporter, decided to double the subsidy paid
to farmers after they threaten to step up protests across the
nation’s key plantation areas amid a plunge in prices.  The government will pay 21.2 billion baht ($659 million)
directly to farmer’s bank accounts, more than the 10 billion
baht approved last week, Deputy Government Spokesman Chalitrat
Chandrubeksa said after a weekly meeting of the cabinet today.
Each farmer will get 2,520 baht per rai (6.25 rai = 1 hectare)
for up to 25 rai, which is equivalent to 12 baht per kilogram,
according to the government.  Futures in Tokyo dropped 16 percent from an 11-month high
in February as slowing growth in  China  and a recession in the
European Union reduced demand. In Thailand, prices tumbled 16
percent to 86.15 baht a kilogram from this year’s peak of 102.7
baht, spurring protests in the southern provinces that account
for 80 percent of the nation’s output. The government ruled out
setting a minimum price and renewal of a purchase program, which
ended in March with a price tag of 25 billion baht.  “Business should be back to normal,” said Bundit
Kerdvongbundit, vice president of Von Bundit Co., Thailand’s
largest rubber exporter. “The subsidy will have a minimal
impact on market prices.”  Thailand, Indonesia and  Malaysia , which account for 70 of
global output, discontinued attempts to reduce supplies after
cutting 300,000 tons in exports in six months through March.  Futures lost 1.3 percent to 282.4 yen a kilogram ($2,825 a
ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange today, down 6.6 percent
this year. Prices reached 337.8 yen on Feb. 6, the highest since
March 2012.  Farmer groups will meet today to consider whether to hold
more rallies on Sept. 14. They earlier threaten to step up
protests if the government fails to meet their demand for a
minimum price. Leaders of the groups were not immediately
available for comments.  The government last week approved another budget of 20
billion baht to provide low-interest loans for farmer groups and
factories that add value to rubber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
