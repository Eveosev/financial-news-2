Croatia’s economy contracted for a
seventh quarter on an annual basis as investments and personal
consumption continued to decline amid  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Gross domestic product fell 0.7 percent from a year
earlier, the  statistics office , based in the capital, Zagreb,
said today, matching a preliminary estimate from Aug. 30.  The economy of the European Union’s newest member has
shrunk more than 10 percent since 2008, during which time
foreign direct investment has plunged 80 percent. The Adriatic
nation will expand 0.7 percent this year, the  government 
predicted in February, trimming a previous 1.8 percent forecast.  Growth will only return in 2014, according to the European
Commission, which forecasts a 1 percent contraction this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
