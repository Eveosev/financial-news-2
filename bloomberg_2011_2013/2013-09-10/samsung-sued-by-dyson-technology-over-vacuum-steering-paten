Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  was sued by
Dyson Technology Ltd., the vacuum cleaner maker founded by U.K.
inventor James Dyson, over claims his company’s steering
technology was infringed.  The company sued over an invention called “a cleaning
appliance with a steering mechanism,” Wiltshire, England-based
Dyson said in an e-mailed statement. It filed the suits on Aug.
29 in London.  Dyson won a patent lawsuit against Samsung in 2009 over its
cyclone vacuum cleaner technology. Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung has been embroiled in patent and copyright disputes
against Apple Inc. over its smartphone and tablet computers on
three continents.  “Samsung has many patent lawyers so I find it hard not to
believe that this is a deliberate or utterly reckless
infringement of our patent,” James Dyson said in the statement.  An e-mail sent to Samsung’s Korean press office out of
normal working hours wasn’t immediately responded to.  The case is Dyson Technology Ltd. v Samsung Electronics
Co.,  High Court  of Justice,  Chancery Division , case no.
