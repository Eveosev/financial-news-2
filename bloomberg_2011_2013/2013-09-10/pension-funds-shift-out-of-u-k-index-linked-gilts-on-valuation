U.K. pension funds are seeking
alternatives to index-linked gilts for inflation-protected cash
flows as the securities have become expensive, according to
consultancy JLT Employee Benefits.  The funds are diversifying into assets such as
infrastructure and property projects to meet long-term
obligations to retirees, Julian Brown, director of investment
consulting at JLT in  London , said in an interview.  “Index-linked gilts are very expensive and they are giving
you negative real yields,” Brown said at a conference run by
the National Association of Pension Funds, whose members have
combined assets of nearly 900 billion pounds ($1.41 trillion).
“Corporate index-linked bonds are available but they are also
expensive if you take into account credit risks,” he said.  Ten-year  index-linked gilts  have yielded less than zero
since September 2011. The rate was at minus 0.24 percent today
after declining to a record minus 1.64 percent on April 5. A
negative yield means investors who hold the security until it
matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  “Infrastructure investments provide an inflation-protected
alternative that investors are looking for,” Brown said. “They
might not be as liquid as bonds but if you are a long-term
investor liquidity might not matter that much.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
