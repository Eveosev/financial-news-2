“Homeland” stars  Claire Danes  and Damian Lewis had meetings at the Central Intelligence Agency while in town for the  Washington  screening of the new season of their CIA-focused drama.  The content of the conversations remains classified, but Gary Newman, the co-chairman of 20th Century Fox Television Inc., joked that “some adaptations to the script” may be made in the future.  “They were incredibly hospitable,” said Lewis of the CIA officials.  Many other “Homeland” cast members were present, along with Matthew Blank, the chairman and chief executive of Showtime Networks Inc., which will air season three starting on Sept. 29.  At Monday night’s screening and after party at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Danes, who plays a CIA officer on the show, stood out from the blue suits in a white Valentino gown and a hot-pink evening bag.  She greeted fans of the show including Congressman Henry Waxman, the California Democrat, who gushed about the series “being so well done” to Congressman Phil Gingrey, the Georgia Republican. Gingrey said he watches “two episodes at a time” to get caught up on the story lines.  It was Danes’s turn to be starry-eyed when she was introduced to author and columnist Maureen Dowd. “So nice to meet you. Wow!” Danes said.  “Homeland” is among the contenders for Outstanding Drama at the Emmy Awards later this month.
