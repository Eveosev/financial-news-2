Tropical Storm Gabrielle reformed
in the Atlantic south of  Bermuda , which can expect high winds,
rough surf and rain later today, according to the  U.S. National
Hurricane Center .  Gabrielle was 165 miles (265 kilometers) south of Bermuda
and moving north at 14 miles per hour at about 8 a.m.  New York 
time, the center said in an advisory. The system’s top winds are
40 mph, and while some strengthening is forecast, Gabrielle
isn’t expected to grow into a hurricane, it said.  A tropical-storm warning is in effect for Bermuda.  “Gabrielle is expected to pass over or near Bermuda by
Wednesday morning,” the center said.  An area of disturbed weather in the northwest Caribbean is
expected to move into the Bay of Campeche, in the southwestern
Gulf of Mexico, in two days, providing the ingredients for a
tropical system, according to the hurricane center. There’s a 60
percent chance a system will form in the next five days.  Tropical Storm Humberto , now about 150 miles west of the
Cape Verde Islands with top sustained winds of 65 mph, is
expected to become the season’s first hurricane later today, the
center said. Its current forecast track takes it through the
middle of the Atlantic far from land.  Eight tropical storms have formed in the Atlantic so far
this season, which began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
