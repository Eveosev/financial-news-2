World Anti-Doping Agency President
John Fahey said a steroid passport will be introduced by the end
of 2013 as the latest means of catching drug cheats.  The initiative will complement the biological passport,
which measures changes in blood profile and can be used to
detect differences from an athlete’s established levels that
might indicate doping.  “The biological passport is a key component against doping
and has been recognized by the courts as evidence,” Fahey said
yesterday at the  International Olympic Committee ’s annual
meeting in  Buenos Aires .  Fahey, an Australian whose term as  WADA  president finishes
at the end of this year, said the Montreal-based organization is
likely to double the ban for first-time drug cheats from two to
four years at its congress in Johannesburg in November.  “The athletes have demanded a tougher approach to cheats
and instead of the current two-year ban, the penalty will be
doubled for first offenders,” he said.  Officials at the Johannesburg meeting also will consider
tighter regulation for coaches, trainers and sports scientists
associated with athletes, Fahey added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
