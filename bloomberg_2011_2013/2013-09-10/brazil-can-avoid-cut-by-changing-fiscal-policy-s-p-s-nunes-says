Brazil  can avoid a credit-rating
cut from Standard & Poor’s by creating a fiscal policy that
would control debt levels and draw private investment, according
to Regina Nunes, the ratings company’s local chief.  Brazil’s BBB rating, the second-lowest investment grade,
was given a negative outlook by S&P in June after gross debt
rose to about 60 percent of gross domestic product.  Nunes, speaking at an event today in Florianopolis, Brazil,
said economic growth will slow if the government can’t attract
private investors to help pay for 250 billion reais ($110
billion) of rail, port and highway projects. Auctions for the
infrastructure concessions start this month.  “Brazil has high inflation, low growth and little space
for more expansionist fiscal policy without creating a debt
problem,” Nunes said. “The government has recognized that it
needs to stimulate private investment, but its attempts to do so
have had no effect.”  Brazil’s rating from S&P matches  Russia ’s classification
and is one level higher than  India ’s BBB-.  Gross domestic product expanded 3.3 percent in the second
quarter from the period a year earlier, faster than economists
had forecast. The economy expanded 0.9 percent in 2012.  Brazil’s  annual inflation  slowed to 6.09 percent in August,
from 6.27 percent the month before. The central bank’s target is
2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
