National Football League teams
finished with the fewest rushing yards in the opening week of a
season since the NFL expanded to 32 teams in 2002.  While defending rushing champion  Adrian Peterson  of the
Minnesota Vikings had a 78-yard touchdown run on his very first
carry of the season, Lesean McCoy of the Philadelphia Eagles and
Shane Vereen of the New England Patriots were the only running
backs to surpass 100 rushing yards during Week 1, with Vereen
just one yard over. A record six quarterbacks had more than 350
passing yards in opening games.  NFL teams combined for 2,964 rushing yards through the
first 16 games, an average of 185 a game. The lowest previous
Week 1 rushing totals over the past 12 years were 3,092 yards
last season and 3,136 in 2003, according to research by
Bloomberg Sports’  StatsInsights.com .  “It’s the style of the game now,” Gil Brandt, a former
vice president of player personnel for the  Dallas Cowboys  and
now an NFL.com analyst, said in a telephone interview. “It’s a
passing league now and it starts in high school. Then they go to
college and that’s become a pass-oriented game.”  The only other player with more than 100 rushing yards in
Week 1 was Oakland Raiders quarterback Terrelle Pryor, who ran
for 112 on 13 carries. Three quarterbacks surpassed 400 passing
yards:  Peyton Manning  of the Denver Broncos (462),  Eli Manning 
of the New York Giants (450) and Colin Kaepernick of the San
Francisco 49ers (412).  Rushing Decade  During the decade of the 1970s, five quarterbacks threw for
more than 400 yards in a game.  “All you have to do is look and see how the running game
is treated in the draft now,” Brandt said.  This year marked the first time since 1963 that no running
backs were taken in the opening round of the NFL draft.  Peterson, who rushed for 2,097 yards last season to finish
nine yards shy of Eric Dickerson’s single-season rushing record,
ran for 93 yards on 18 carries in the Vikings’ 34-24 season-opening loss to the Detroit Lions two days ago.  Matthew Stafford  had 357 passing yards in leading the Lions
to victory, joining the Manning brothers, Kaepernick,  Joe Flacco 
of the Baltimore Ravens and  Drew Brees  of the New Orleans Saints
with more than 350 passing yards.  Matt Schaub  threw for 346
yards last night in leading the Houston Texans to a 31-28
comeback win over the San Diego Chargers.  Rushing yards were much harder to come by in Week 1.  Lead backs  Arian Foster , Doug Martin,  Matt Forte , Darren McFadden, Trent Richardson, Maurice Jones-Drew,  Frank Gore ,
Marshawn Lynch,  Ray Rice , C.J. Spiller and  BenJarvus Green-Ellis 
combined for 501 yards on 187 runs, an average of 2.7 yards a
carry. The  New York  Jets’ leading rusher, at 47 yards on six
carries, was rookie quarterback Geno Smith; running backs Bilal Powell and Chris Ivory combined for 44 yards on 22 rushes.  New Rules  NFL rule changes have helped the passing game. Quarterbacks
and wide receivers have more protection from being hit, while
penalties for pass interference, defensive holding and illegal
contact are more strictly enforced.  “It’s almost impossible to play pass defense in the NFL
right now,” said former Super Bowl-winning quarterback Trent Dilfer, who’s now an NFL analyst for ESPN.  Brandt said that, in 1956, a quarter of the NFL’s then-12
teams had Hall of Fame starting quarterbacks, with none of them
completing more than 57 percent of their passes or throwing for
more touchdown than interceptions.  Brees connected on an NFL-record 71.2 percent of his passes
in 2011, when he also set a league mark with 5,476 passing yards.
Twenty-one quarterbacks completed more than 60 percent of their
passes in Week 1, with six topping 70 percent.  “It’s an evolution that starts with the high school, and
moves to college and now the coaches get this sort of accuracy
and talent and they are going to throw the ball,” Brandt said.  There have been four 400-yard passing games by rookie
quarterbacks, all in the last two seasons.  Of the nine highest single-season passing yardage totals,
eight have come in the past five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
