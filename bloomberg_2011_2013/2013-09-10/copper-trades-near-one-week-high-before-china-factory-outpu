Copper fell for the first time in
three days on concerns that the conflict in  Syria  will deepen
and the U.S. Federal Reserve may curtail stimulus, reducing
demand for the metal.  Metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.6
percent to $7,150 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,160 at 1:07 p.m. in Shanghai. The price touched $7,243
yesterday, the highest intraday level since Sept. 4.  President  Barack Obama  will make his case for U.S. action
against Syria in an address to the nation at 9 p.m. Washington
time. The U.S. says President Bashar al-Assad’s regime used
sarin gas outside of Damascus on Aug. 21, killing more than
1,400 people. The Senate is expected to vote on the resolution
by the end of the week. The Fed will cut Treasury purchases to
$35 billion from $45 billion, while maintaining mortgage-bond
buying at $40 billion, according to the median of 34 responses
in a Bloomberg survey released Sept. 6.  “Investors are hesitant to hold their positions because of
the uncertainties in Syria and the Fed decision,” said Xiong Dabiao, an analyst at Minmetals Futures Co. in  Shanghai .
“Investors want timely profits at the moment, which could make
the prices volatile.”  In  China , a report due later today will show factory output
in the world’s second-biggest economy expanded 9.9 percent in
August from a year earlier, after rising 9.7 percent in July,
according to the median of 45 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Retail sales probably rose 13.3 percent on an annual basis, from
13.2 percent the previous month, a separate poll shows.  Copper for delivery in December declined 0.9 percent to
51,800  yuan  ($8,465) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Metal for delivery in December was down 0.6 percent at $3.2575 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  On the LME, aluminum, zinc and nickel fell, while lead was
little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
