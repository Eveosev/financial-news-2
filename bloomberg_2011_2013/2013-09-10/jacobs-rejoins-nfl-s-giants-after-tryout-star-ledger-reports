Brandon Jacobs  got his job back
with the  New York Giants  who held running back tryouts after
starter  David Wilson  fumbled twice in a season-opening loss to
the Dallas Cowboys.  Jacobs, 31, spent the 2012 National Football League season
with the San Francisco 49ers after seven years with the Giants.
He was released by the Giants in March 2012 when he wouldn’t
agree to a pay cut.  “Whatever role they want me to play, I’ll come in and do
it,” Jacobs said in a statement released by the team. “I know
the offense.”  The 6-foot-4, 256-pound Jacobs, who had a tryout with
Willis McGahee and Joe McKnight yesterday, gives the Giants a
veteran presence in the backfield as well as an experienced
pass-blocker. The Giants lost backup Andre Brown in their final
preseason game to a fractured left leg that will keep him out
for the next two months.  The 5-foot-9 Wilson fumbled twice and struggled at times in
pass-blocking situations in a 36-31 loss to the Cowboys three
days ago.  Giants coach  Tom Coughlin  has declined to say if Wilson, a
2012 first-round draft pick out of Virginia Tech, will start
Sept. 15 at home against the Denver Broncos. Before Jacobs’s
signing, Da’Rel Scott and rookie Michael Cox were the team’s
only other running backs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
