Europe’s biggest soccer leagues and clubs urged the sport’s global ruling body to avoid rescheduling the  Qatar  2022 World Cup to the winter before assessing the effects of the change.  The Nyon, Switzerland-based Association of European Professional Football Leagues said “the side effects on the international calendar of a possible rescheduling should be assessed through an extensive fact-based analysis.”  The executive committee of FIFA, the world governing body, is to meet in Zurich on Oct. 3 and 4 to discuss the possible switch to the European winter from the traditional summer schedule, with President Sepp Blatter telling  Inside World Football  in an interview published yesterday that it is discriminatory to restrict the World Cup to certain months of the year.  Blatter also said FIFA may have “made a mistake” in awarding a summer World Cup to Qatar. FIFA issued a statement today to clarify that the word “mistake” used by Blatter was over the timing, not the location of the tournament.  FIFA General Secretary  Jerome Valcke  told reporters in Buenos Aires today that next month’s verdict would be a decision “in principle,” and that a consultation process will begin once that decision is made.  “We then have to finalize the agreement with the different parties,” Valcke said. “So as long as all of these are not finalized, it’s not a firm, final decision.”  No Compensation  Valcke also said FIFA won’t offer a financial settlement to any national leagues that have to alter their domestic schedules.  “Compensation is a word you should never use,” he said.  The  European Club Association , which is holding its general assembly in Geneva, echoed the EPFL’s request for more time before making a decision. The body, which represents 214 of the continent’s top teams, said in a statement that it will discuss the matter with stakeholders including national associations, leagues and players.  “We are not in a hurry,” the ECA said. “The World Cup takes place in 2022. We request FIFA to take the time for a proper, serious and exhaustive consultation.”  122 Degrees  The World Cup is traditionally held in June and July, during the off-season for most of Europe’s domestic leagues, but FIFA officials are concerned that Qatar’s temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in those months would be unsafe for players and fans.  Moving the World Cup would disrupt leagues in Europe, South America and  Africa . Richard Scudamore, chief executive officer of  England ’s Premier League, said in an  interview  with Sky Sports last month that making the necessary calendar changes would be “nigh on impossible.”  Scudamore’s stance was criticized by Michel Platini, the head of European soccer’s governing body UEFA, which supports the rescheduling. He told reporters in  Monaco  last month that England had enjoyed 150 years of respect for its soccer calendar, and that it was time to make a concession.  The EPFL represents 29 leagues including those in England, Spain,  Germany ,  France  and  Italy . It also cited potential clashes with other major sporting events like the Winter Olympics, which are usually held in the same year as the World Cup.  The EPFL said FIFA should study the consequences a move may have on the transfer system, commercial and media contracts and possible effects on the amateur game.  An appropriate consultation process is needed with the involvement of “all relevant football stakeholders, including the EPFL,” it said.
