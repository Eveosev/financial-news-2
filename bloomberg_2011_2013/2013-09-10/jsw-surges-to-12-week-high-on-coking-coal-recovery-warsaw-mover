Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA and
 New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the largest coking-coal producers in
 Poland  and the Czech Republic, surged to a 12-week high after
the commodity extended a rally in  China .  JSW gained 7.7 percent to 77.55 zloty at 1:38 p.m. in
Warsaw, the strongest intraday level since June 20 and bringing
a three-day rally to 19 percent. NWR soared 20 percent to 28.5
koruna in Prague. Spot  coking coal , used for steel making, rose
1 percent to $150.5 per metric ton yesterday, the highest since
April 12. The commodity has surged 16 percent in the  quarter .  “The global economy has likely bottomed out, which boosts
forecasts for the steel market,” Lukasz Prokopiuk, a Warsaw-based analyst at broker Dom Maklerski IDM SA, said by phone
today. “The prospects for coking coal are very good.”  Coking coal prices at the current level signal the
benchmark price for the fourth quarter will settle in a range of
$155 to $160, Mitesh Thakkar, an analyst at FBR & Co. in
Arlington,  Virginia , wrote in a note yesterday. The commodity
tumbled in the first two quarters of the year, weighing on JSW
and NWR shares, which are down 16 percent and 71 percent
respectively in 2013.  Coking coal will be stable in the fourth quarter compared
with the third, JSW Chief Executive Officer Jaroslaw Zagorowski
said on Aug. 12. The company has an “ambitious objective of not
generating a loss” this year after sales and net income in the
three months through June retreated, he said last month.  “Under a good scenario, fourth-quarter coal prices in
Europe may come up to $160 per ton, which would mean JSW will
generate profit in the whole 2013,” IDM’s Prokopiuk said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
