Dun & Bradstreet Corp. (DNB) , the 172-year-old provider of business data and risk-management services,
picked IDG Communications Inc. Chief Executive Officer Robert Carrigan as its new president and CEO.  Carrigan, 47, is replacing Sara Mathew, who said in May she
planned to retire, according to a statement today. Carrigan will
take over on Oct. 7, while Mathew will remain with the company
through the end of the year to aid the transition.  Dun & Bradstreet turned to Carrigan to help revive growth
by adapting its database of business records to the Internet,
where it competes with companies such as Google Inc. in
assembling information. At IDG, Carrigan helped the publisher of
Computerworld move into digital media, Dun & Bradstreet said.  “Bob quickly emerged as the candidate who would bring a
powerful new perspective to our business,” Christopher Coughlin, the company’s lead director, said in the statement.
Coughlin will assume the title of chairman when Mathew steps
down, the company said.  The company reported sales growth of less than 1 percent
last quarter from a year earlier, its first increase in five
quarters. Dun & Bradstreet also made a failed attempt to find a
buyer for the company last year, Reuters reported in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
