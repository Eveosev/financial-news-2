(Corrects Germany score in final paragraph.)  Italy and the Netherlands both won
to become the first teams from Europe to qualify for the 2014
soccer  World Cup .  Italy beat the Czech Republic 2-1 to guarantee a first-place finish in qualifying Group B with two games left, while
the Dutch won 2-0 at Andorra to take Group D.  The winners of each of the nine European groups advance to
the World Cup in  Brazil , with the best eight runners-up going
into a playoff for the remaining four slots.  Germany won 3-0 at the Faroe Islands and Switzerland beat
Norway 2-0 to give both victors five-point leads in their groups
with two games left. England’s 0-0 draw in Ukraine moved it one
point ahead of Montenegro, which didn’t play tonight, in Group
H.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
