The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries said the global oil market is “well-supplied,” and trimmed demand estimates for its crude in 2014
as production outside the group increases.  OPEC will need to provide an average 29.6 million barrels a
day next year, reducing its estimate “slightly” from last
month, the group said today in its market report. OPEC’s 12
members pumped about 600,000 barrels a day more than this level
in August. OPEC boosted forecasts for output from  other
producers  amid supply growth in the U.S., Mexico and Norway.  “The market at present remains well-supplied,” the
organization’s Vienna-based secretariat said. “Crude stocks
should gradually begin to build as refiners head into
maintenance at the end of the third quarter.”  Brent crude  has advanced about 1.9 percent this year,
trading at $113.19 a barrel on the ICE Futures  Europe  in  London 
today. Prices were boosted as the U.S. recovery gathers pace,
Europe emerges from recession and Libyan supplies are crimped by
protests. Unrest in  Syria  also threatens Middle Eastern oil
exports. OPEC is next due to meet for a review of production
targets on Dec. 4 in Vienna.  Comfortable Supplies  Inventories of crude and refined products in the world’s
most industrialized nations are “comfortable,” equating to
about 58.5 days of consumption, while rising stockpiles in
emerging nations “should also provide a further cushion to the
market, complementing existing and expanding crude production
capacity,” according to the report.  The organization boosted projections for supplies from non-OPEC producers, by 130,000 barrels a day, as stronger-than-expected growth this year in the U.S.,  Mexico  and Norway feeds
into the 2014 forecast. Non-OPEC nations will bolster output by
1.2 million barrels to 55.2 million a day in 2014, according to
the report.  OPEC said its production fell by 123,900 barrels a day to
30.2 million last month as labor unrest cut Libya’s output by
477,700 barrels a day, based on data from secondary sources. The
losses outweighed higher production by OPEC’s biggest member,
Saudi Arabia, which boosted output by 188,500 barrels a day to
9.96 million, and an increase in  Iraq , by 132,800 barrels a day
to 3.1 million.  Saudi Arabia pumped 10.19 million barrels last month, the
kingdom said in direct communications with the organization.  Global oil demand will increase by 1 million barrels a day,
or 1.2 percent, to 90.77 million a day next year, OPEC said,
keeping its forecast unchanged from last month.  The group’s members are Algeria, Angola,  Ecuador , Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United
Arab Emirates and Venezuela.  The  International Energy Agency  will release its monthly
report on Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
