Partners Group Holding AG (PGHN) , a Swiss
 money manager  focused on private equity, reported a decline in
performance fees and a weaker first-half revenue margin. The
shares dropped the most in almost five years.  Performance fees slid 35 percent to 13 million Swiss francs
($13.9 million), depressing the firm’s margin on revenue to 127
basis points, from 137 basis points a year earlier, the Zug,
Switzerland-based company said today in a statement. A basis
point is one hundredth of a percentage point.  Performance-related income was the “main miss,” and
margins were lower than expected,  Teresa Nielsen , an analyst at
 Vontobel Holding AG (VONN)  in Zurich, wrote in a note to clients.
Nielsen has a hold rating on the stock.  Partners Group, which has about two-thirds of its
investments in private equity and the rest in real estate,
corporate debt and infrastructure, is targeting growth in the
Americas to help reach a goal of 50 billion euros ($66 billion)
in assets under management.  The company fell 8.7 percent to 226.4 francs at the close
of trading, the biggest drop since October 2008, valuing the
company at 6 billion francs.  Net income advanced to 156.5 million francs from 120.4
million francs in the year-earlier period with recurring revenue
from management fees increasing 13 percent to 195 million
francs.  “Global pension markets, our dominant client sector,
continue to grow,” Andre Frei, co-chief executive officer, said
in the statement.  Assets under management rose 5.9 percent to 30.3 billion
euros after first-half inflows of 2.2 billion euros lifted by
corporate and public pension funds, Partners Group reported in
July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
