Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, plans this month to offer the first fuel
to be exported from a  joint-venture refinery  with  Total SA (FP) , two
people with knowledge of the situation said.  The Saudi company may sell one or two cargoes of fuel oil
from the venture known as Saudi Aramco Total Refining and
Petrochemical Co., or Satorp, located at the Persian Gulf port
of Jubail, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is not public. Media officials for Total
in Dubai and Paris and for the state oil company known as Saudi
Aramco in Dhahran didn’t immediately respond to e-mails
requesting comment earlier today.  Saudi Aramco Products Trading Co., an Aramco division, will
sell the fuel, the two people said. The cargoes will each
comprise 80,000 metric tons, and the first of them could be
ready for sale through direct negotiation, rather than by
tender, late this month, one of the people said.  Satorp, 62.5 percent owned by Aramco with the rest held by
Total, is processing the Arab Light blend of crude oil at a
120,000 barrel-a-day unit, the second person said. Another crude
unit of the same size will start up next month, this person
said. A coking facility, which will consume fuel oil to produce
diesel and gasoline, is to start in November and will enable the
refinery to process heavier oil grades, the person said.  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are boosting
domestic refining capacity to produce more fuels such as
gasoline and diesel for local use and to profit from the higher
prices processed fuels fetch in international markets compared
with crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
