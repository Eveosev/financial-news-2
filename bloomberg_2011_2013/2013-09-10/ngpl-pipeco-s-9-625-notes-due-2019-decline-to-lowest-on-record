Bonds from NGPL PipeCo LLC, the
natural gas pipeline owner and operator, dropped to the lowest
level on record after holding a conference call today with
investors.  Its $550 million of 9.625 percent notes due June 2019 fell
8.9 cents to 93.56 cents on the dollar to yield 11.17 percent,
down from this year’s high of 116.25 cents in January, according
to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price for the debt is the
lowest since it was issued in May 2012.  Moody’s Investors Service cut NGPL PipeCo’s credit rating
two steps in June to B2, five steps below investment grade. The
ratings firm put the Houston-based company on review for
downgrade in March as earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization declined more than expected.  NGPL PipeCo, which operates Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of
America, has about $3.1 billion of bonds and loans outstanding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kinder Morgan  Inc. owns the shares of NGPL HoldCo Inc.,
which owns 20 percent of NGPL PipeCo, according to Kinder Morgan
 websites . Myria Acquisition Inc. holds the rest.  Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Kinder Morgan, confirmed
the call occurred and declined further comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
