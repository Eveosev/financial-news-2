California  officials defended a law
requiring sex offenders to report their Twitter, e-mail and
chatroom accounts and screen names to police, saying it doesn’t
violate free speech and can assist law enforcement probes.  The state’s Proposition 35, approved by more than 80
percent of California voters last year and backed by former
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  executive Chris Kelly, increases prison terms for
sex offenders and adds reporting requirements for them.
Registered sex offenders in California are required under the
law to report to law enforcement all Internet identifiers and
online service providers they use. Civil rights groups sued to
block the law, saying it violates free speech.  “It doesn’t regulate speech, it doesn’t prevent sex
offenders from speaking online,” James Harrison, an attorney
for the measures’s backers, said at a hearing today before the
U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The reporting
requirements would give police “a head start” if a parent
reports that a child has been communicating with a stranger
online and has gone to meet that person, he said.  U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson in San Francisco in
January issued a ruling halting the law from being enforced,
saying that in light of constitutional free-speech rights,
Proposition 35’s Internet registration requirements aren’t
narrowly tailored enough to the state’s goal of combating sexual
exploitation.  The case is Doe v. Harris, 13-15263, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
