Dubai’s stock index surged the most
since December 2009 after President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
would put a strike on  Syria  on hold if the nation followed
through on a proposal to surrender its chemical weapons.  The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  climbed 8.5 percent, the biggest
gainer among 94 gauges monitored by Bloomberg globally, to
2,522.15 at the close in Dubai. Before today, the measure had
plunged 15 percent from a five-year high on Aug. 25.  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the stock with the biggest weighting on the
index, soared 8.5 percent, while discount carrier  Air Arabia
PJSC (AIRARABI)  jumped 10 percent. Abu Dhabi’s measure gained 5.5 percent
and Qatar’s 4.9 percent.  Dubai’s stocks posted the biggest  swings  in the world in
the past month on concern a military strike against Syria would
have repercussions in the oil-rich  Middle East . Shares rose
after a Russia-backed proposal for Syria to surrender its
chemical weapons. While questioning whether Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad would yield control of his weapons, Obama said
on ABC News that an attack would “absolutely” be put on hold
if Syria followed through.  “Investors are relieved that it looks like the military
strike will be postponed, and it’s a rebound from the last six
or seven-day drop,” Tariq Qaqish, a director at Dubai-based
fund manager Al Mal Capital PSC, said by phone. “Things on the
ground in the region are still positive, especially in the GCC.
Economies have moved on thanks to infrastructure spending, and
higher oil revenues and prices.”  Most Volatile  The Middle East accounted for about 35 percent of global
crude production in the first quarter of this year, according to
the  International Energy Agency .  Oil prices  have averaged $97.60
dollar a barrel this year, compared with $94.15 in 2012.  The Dubai index’s 30-day volatility, a measure of
fluctuations in Dubai’s equities gauge, rose to 42 today, the
highest since January 2010 and the most among 72 indexes tracked
by Bloomberg. That’s more than 10 points above  Japan .  The gauge has climbed 55 percent this year, more than any
of the 50 largest equity markets, as the Persian Gulf business
hub recovers from the global credit crisis that led to a crash
in property prices. Economic growth is set to accelerate to 4.6
percent, on average, through 2015 helped by a rebound in
tourism, trade and transport, government estimates show. That’s
more than twice as fast as the prior four years.  CDS Tightens  The yield on Dubai’s 5.591 percent bonds declined seven
basis points, or 0.07 of a percentage point, to 4.83 percent,
the lowest in two weeks at 4:33 p.m. in the emirate. Dubai’s
credit default swaps, or the cost to protect the sheikhdom’s
debt against default, fell five basis points to 225, according
to CMA data.  The value of shares traded in the emirate climbed to 1.35
billion  dirhams  ($368 million) compared with a daily average
this year of 529 million dirhams. Emaar gained the most since
March 2011 to 5.75 dirhams and  Air Arabia  soared the most since
December 2009 to 1.31 dirhams.  Shares across the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council
rallied, with the Bloomberg GCC200 Index advancing 3.3 percent,
the most since March 2011.  Saudi Arabia  and Kuwait’s measures
climbed 2.9 percent, Oman’s rose 2.6 percent and Bahrain’s 0.4
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
