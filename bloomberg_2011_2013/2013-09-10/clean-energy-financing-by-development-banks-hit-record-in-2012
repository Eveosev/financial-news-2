Development banks worldwide lent a
record $108.9 billion to renewable energy and energy-efficient
technology last year as they scale back investment in coal-fired
power plants, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  KfW Group was the biggest lender furnishing $34.4 billion
in 2012 followed by China Development Bank Corp. with $26
billion, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in a report today
that used data from 26 institutions.  The state-backed lenders have boosted their financing of
clean energy at an average rate of 25 percent over the last five
years and that trend looks set to continue, the London-based
researcher said.  “Since large development banks like the European
Investment Bank and the World Bank Group have stated their
intention to scale down or eliminate investment in coal-fired
energy generation, we expect continued growth in clean energy
investment,” according to the report. “In 2013, we expect
growth between 15 and 30 percent.”  Development banks furnished $424.8 billion of clean energy
finance between 2007 and 2012, according to the report. About
half of that was disbursed in Europe, excluding  Russia .  To contact the reporters on this story:
