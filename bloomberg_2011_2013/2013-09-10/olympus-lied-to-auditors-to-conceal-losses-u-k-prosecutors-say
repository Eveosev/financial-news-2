Olympus Corp. (7733)  told auditors that an
issue of shares worth $620 million was provided for financial
advice when it was actually designed to conceal the company’s
losses, U.K. prosecutors said.  Olympus and its Gyrus Group Ltd. unit misled accountants at
KPMG LLP and Ernst & Young LLP by saying that 176,981,106 shares
had been issued to Axam Investment Ltd. in exchange for advice,
the Serious Fraud Office said in court papers at a hearing
today.  The shares “had been issued for a fraudulent purpose,
namely so that they could be purchased by Olympus Finance UK
Ltd. and the purchase price of or about $620 million could then
covertly be transferred to Olympus Corp. in  Japan  to conceal the
extent of that company’s losses in securities and other
trading,” the SFO said.  The case was transferred to a higher criminal court for a
hearing on Sept. 24. Olympus didn’t enter a plea today. The
company was charged with five counts of making a misleading or
false statement to an auditor on Sept. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
