Cap SA (CAP) ,  Chile ’s largest iron-ore
mining company and steel producer, fell the most in two weeks
after  Banco Santander  cut its profit estimates and said a recent
jump in the stock price was unjustified.  Cap retreated 4 percent to 12,029 pesos at 1:41 p.m. in
Santiago, the most since Aug. 27 on a closing basis. It was the
worst performer on the benchmark IPSA index, which lost 0.4
percent.  Santander reiterated its recommendation on Santiago-based
Cap’s shares at the equivalent of sell, with a year-end price
target of 9,400 pesos by the end of 2014. The bank cited lower
forecasts for iron prices in an e-mailed report dated today.  New iron ore output from Australian producers and
“unsustainable” growth in Chinese steel production will
pressure iron prices, the analysts Rodrigo Ordonez and Francisco Errandonea wrote in the report. Cap’s  23 percent  gain in the
past month lacks compelling reasons, Santander said.  Santander cut its estimates for the company’s earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization by 7 percent
for 2013 and 9 percent for next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
