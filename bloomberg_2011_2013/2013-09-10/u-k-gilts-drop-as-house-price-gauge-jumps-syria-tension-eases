U.K. government bonds declined,
pushing 10-year yields toward the highest in more than two
years, after a house-price gauge rose to the highest in almost
seven years, damping demand for the safest fixed-income assets.  Ten-year gilts fell with U.S. Treasuries as an easing of
international tension over conflict in  Syria  and reports showing
 China â€™s industrial production and retail sales beat analyst
estimates boosted demand for higher-yielding assets. Britain
will auction 2.75 billion pounds ($4.3 billion) of 30-year debt
today. Sterling was little changed after reaching its highest
level versus the dollar in 12 weeks yesterday.  The 10-year gilt yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3 percent at 8:36 a.m. London time. It
reached 3.01 percent on Sept. 5, the highest since July 2011.
The 2.25 percent security maturing in September 2023 fell 0.36,
or 3.60 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 93.58.  Gilts lost 4.7 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes, underperforming
German securities, which dropped 2.7 percent, and Treasuries,
which declined 3.9 percent, the indexes show.  The pound was at $1.5690 after reaching $1.5733 yesterday,
the highest since June 17. Sterling traded at 84.43 pence per
euro after appreciating to 83.92 pence on Sept. 6, the strongest
level since Jan. 24.  The debt office last auctioned 30-year bonds on July 11 at
an average yield of 3.553 percent. The U.K. is also scheduled to
sell 3.75 billion pounds of 10-year gilts on Thursday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
