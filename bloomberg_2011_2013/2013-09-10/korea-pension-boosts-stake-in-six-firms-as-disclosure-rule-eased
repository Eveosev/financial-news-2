South Korea’s National Pension
Service increased its holdings in six local companies to more
than 10 percent after the government eased disclosure
requirements for the country’s biggest investor last month.  The companies included  Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) , which helped
build the world’s tallest building in Dubai,  Mando Corp. (060980)  and  LS
Corp. (006260) , the NPS said in regulatory filings. Samsung C&T gained
1.7 percent to its highest close in three months. Mando, South
Korea’s third-largest auto-parts maker, rose 1.2 percent at the
close in  Seoul . The benchmark Kospi index rose 1 percent.  The state pension fund gained more scope to increase stakes
after new rules that took effect on Aug. 29 lengthened the
timing of public filings for transactions above 10 percent to
once a quarter from within five days. The NPS has said it will
continue disclosing stakes within five days when they first
breach the 10 percent level.  “The six companies were picked to be included in the
pension fund’s buying list because of their attractive
valuations and solid earnings outlooks for the second half,” Im Jeong Jae, a  money manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion, said in an
interview in Seoul today. “This is not the end of the list as
the agency will continue to buy above the 10 percent threshold
as it is given more freedom.”  NPS also held more than 10 percent of SKC Co., IsuPetasys
Co., a components maker, and  Hansol CSN (009180)  Co., according to the
filings.  Samsung C&T dropped 9 percent in 2013 and trades for 21
times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, down from a
multiple of about 25 in April 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Mando trades for 9.2 times estimated 12-month
earnings, compared to Japan-based  Denso Corp. (6902) ’s 14 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
