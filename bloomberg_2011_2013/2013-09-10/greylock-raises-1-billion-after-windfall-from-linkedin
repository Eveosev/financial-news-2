Greylock Partners , the venture
capital firm behind  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) ,  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and  Workday
Inc. (WDAY) , raised $1 billion for its 14th fund to back startups
focused on consumer and business-focused technology.  The Menlo Park, California-based firm raised the same
amount of money as in its previous fund and received capital
from the same group of investors, David Sze, a partner at
Greylock, said in an interview. Four new partners are being
included in the fund -- Jerry Chen, Josh Elman, Simon Rothman
and Dan Portillo -- making the total 10.  Greylock, founded in 1965, has flourished in recent years
even as the broader venture industry has struggled. Based on the
performance of companies that have gone public from its 2001 and
2005 funds, the firm has more than doubled its money, Bloomberg
Businessweek reported in July. Much of the firm’s recent success
is tied to early investments in mobile, and now Greylock is
betting on a surge in on-demand content and information.  “If you look back five years, we didn’t have tablets” and
the iPhone was young, Sze said. In the next decade, “there will
be an incredible leap forward in the idea of getting things how
you want, where you want and when you want,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
