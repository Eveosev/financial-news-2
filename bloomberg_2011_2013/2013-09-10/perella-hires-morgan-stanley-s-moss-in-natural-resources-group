Perella Weinberg Partners LP hired
Ryan Moss, formerly an investment banker at Morgan Stanley, as a
partner in its advisory business to expand coverage of natural
resources.  Moss joins partners Michael Dickman in New York and Bob Maguire in London in focusing on that sector, according to a
statement today. Moss most recently served as managing director
in Morgan Stanley’s investment-banking unit in Houston.  “Ryan’s expertise in the midstream and upstream sub-sectors will allow us to continue enhancing our sector coverage,
enabling us to advise an even greater segment of clients in the
natural resources space,”  Peter Weinberg , founding partner at
Perella Weinberg, said in the statement.  Perella Weinberg has advised on natural resources deals
such as  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) ’s purchase of Massey Energy
Co. in 2011, valued at more than $7 billion. Founded in 2006,
the New York-based firm has more than 400 employees in cities
including  San Francisco , Dubai and Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
