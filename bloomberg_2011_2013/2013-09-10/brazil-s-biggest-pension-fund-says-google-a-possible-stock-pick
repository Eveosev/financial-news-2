State-run  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) ’s
pension fund, the nation’s largest, plans to invest in foreign
stocks that have a low correlation to the benchmark Ibovespa.  Directors of the fund, known as Previ, have approved global
investments of as much as 340 million reais ($149 million) this
year in stocks that may include  Google Inc. (GOOG) , said Antonio Luiz Benevides, executive manager of the fund, handling 164 billion
reais for Banco do Brasil employees.  Previ’s directors have yet to approve stock picks for the
fund, which will use the MSCI World Index as a benchmark,
Benevides said at an event in Florianopolis, Brazil. The fund
was created by BB Dtvm, an asset manager based in  Sao Paulo .  Previ may also invest in fixed-income and private equity
abroad in coming years and plans to step up real-estate
investments in Brazil this year, Benevides said.  “We’re going to start investing abroad, and we will start
with equities,” Benevides said. “Brazil will still be our
focus.”  Brazil’s pension funds reported an average loss of 0.7
percent in the first half, according to to the Brazilian pension
fund association, known as Abrapp. The Ibovespa fell 22 percent
during that period while Google, based in  Mountain View ,
California, rallied 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
