IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones
SA (IRS) ,  Argentina ’s largest publicly traded real estate company,
prepared to bid for a controlling stake in Israel’s  IDB Holding
Corp. (IDBH)  through an investment in Bermuda-based Dolphin Fund Ltd.  IRSA paid $75 million for shares in Dolphin, which is
analyzing the possibility of investing as much as $200 million
in IDB Holding, according to regulatory filings. Argentine
businessman Eduardo Elsztain is chairman of both IRSA and
Dolphin.  Dolphin will use the cash to acquire a stake in IDB, a
holding company run by Isaeli businessman Nochi Dankner, which
has interests in real estate, energy, insurance, banking and
telecommunications. IDB has about 2 billion shekels ($558
million) of debt outstanding. Elsztain said he would make the
investment through Dolphin in a June 7 letter filed with the  Tel
Aviv stock exchange .  “Along with two investors, Dolphin is analyzing an
investment of as much as $200 million in IDB Holding Corporation
Ltd,” IRSA said in a filing to Argentina’s securities regulator
today. “In the event of proceeding with the investment, Dolphin
will have political rights to appoint IDBH directors.”  Sergio Dattilo, an IRSA spokesman, said in a telephone
interview from  Buenos Aires  that Dolphin is working to acquire a
stake in IDB, and IRSA will manage Dolphin.  IRSA’s American Depositary Receipts  rallied  6.5 percent in
 New York , the most since Jan. 22, to $8.01 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
