Australia ’s dollar advanced to a
six-week high before reports forecast to show industrial
production and retail sales increased in  China , the South
Pacific nation’s largest export market.  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for China, which
shows if the country’s data beat or missed expectations, touched
a five-month high yesterday. Australian  government bonds  fell,
with the 10-year yield rising toward the most in 17 months. New
Zealand’s dollar held a two-day gain after card-spending
increased more than economists estimated.  “I do expect the Chinese data to be relatively solid,”
said Derek Mumford, a director at Rochford Capital, a foreign-exchange risk-management company in Sydney. “The Aussie bounce
has been relatively strong.” The Australian dollar may rise to
94 U.S. cents in a few days, he said.  Australia’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to 92.39 U.S. cents at
11:03 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday, after it touched 92.45, the
highest since July 29. The currency gained 0.3 percent to 92.16
yen, after earlier reaching 92.19, the strongest since July 24.
It fetched NZ$1.1522 from NZ$1.1509.  New Zealand ’s dollar bought 80.20 U.S. cents from 80.18
yesterday, when it reached 80.34, the strongest since Aug. 20.
The kiwi dollar advanced 0.2 percent to 79.98 yen.  The  yield  on Australia’s benchmark 10-year bond climbed
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.12 percent
from yesterday. It touched 4.16 percent on Sept. 6, the highest
since April 2012.  China’s Economy  In China,  industrial production  probably increased 9.9
percent in August from a year earlier, the fastest annual rate
since December, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before the data today. Economists in
a separate Bloomberg poll forecast retail sales grew 13.3
percent in a year through August, up from 13.2 percent in July.  National Australia Bank Ltd. will release its gauges of
Australian business conditions and confidence for August today.  In New Zealand, the  value  of transactions on electronic
cards rose 0.8 percent last month from July, when it gained a
revised 0.5 percent, the statistics bureau said today in
Wellington. That compared with a 0.6 percent growth estimated by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand sets policy on Sept. 12.
The nation’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive
a floating rate, was little changed at 3.47 percent.  -- Editors: Naoto Hosoda, Ken McCallum  To contact the reporter on this story:
