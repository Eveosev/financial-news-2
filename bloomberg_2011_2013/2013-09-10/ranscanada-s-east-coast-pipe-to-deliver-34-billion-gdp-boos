     Sept. 10 (Bloomberg) -- TransCanada Corp., the country’s
second-biggest pipeline operator, said its proposed crude oil
conduit to the Atlantic Coast from  Western Canada (CWB)  will generate
a C$35 billion ($34 billion) boost to the economy during its
construction and operation.  More than 10,000 full-time jobs will be created during
construction and the project will support an additional 1,000
permanent posts once it begins service, TransCanada said today
in a statement, citing a study it commissioned from Deloitte &
Touche LLP. It will also deliver an extra C$10 billion in  tax
revenue .  The C$12 billion  Energy East project , announced Aug. 1,
would have a capacity of 1.1 million barrels a day and be in
service by the end of 2017 for deliveries to Quebec and to New
Brunswick in 2018. It involves converting part of a 3,000
kilometer (1,864 mile) natural gas pipeline and building 1,400
kilometers of new pipeline.  The project is separate from TransCanada’s proposed $5.3
billion Keystone XL pipeline to the  Gulf of Mexico . Approval is
pending from the U.S. government.  The Council of Canadians said last month the project would
endanger waterways, citing oil spills caused by other pipeline
operators.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  spilled 20,000 barrels of oil into the
Kalamazoo River in Michigan in 2010 and Exxon Mobil Corp.’s
Pegasus pipeline ruptured in March, sending 5,000 barrels of oil
flowing through streets in Mayflower, Arkansas.  Enbridge Inc., also based in Calgary, is Canada’s largest
pipeline operator by sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
