Brazil ’s swap rates climbed for the
first time in a week as higher-than-forecast inflation spurred
speculation that the central bank will sustain the pace of
borrowing-cost increases.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 10.35 percent at
12:41 p.m. in Sao Paulo. The real snapped three days of gains,
depreciating 0.5 percent to 2.2877 per dollar. It earlier today
touched 2.2620, the strongest intraday since July 29.  Brazil’s IGP-M inflation index of wholesale, construction
and consumer prices climbed 1.02 percent in the 10 days
beginning Aug. 21, the Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today.
The median forecast of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a 0.67 percent increase. The report indicates that the
real’s 6.2 percent decline in the past three months is making
products more expensive, according to Francisco Carvalho,
currency director at Liquidez Dtvm in  Sao Paulo .  “The jump shows the dollar is already hitting prices,” he
said in a telephone interview. “We have to wait and see if this
pass-through inflation will affect consumers.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
