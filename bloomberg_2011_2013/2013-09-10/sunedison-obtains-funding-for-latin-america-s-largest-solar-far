SunEdison Inc. (SUNE) , the polysilicon
supplier formerly known as MEMC Electronic Materials Inc., won
$212.5 million in  project financing  to help build what may be
 Latin America ’s biggest solar power plant in Chile.  The Overseas Private Investment Corp., the U.S.
government’s development finance institution, provided a $147.5
million loan, St. Peters, Missouri-based SunEdison said today in
a statement. IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, provided $65
million of debt.  The financing package is the largest for a solar park in
Latin America and demonstrates a growing confidence among
investors for these types of projects, said Lilian Alves, a Sao
Paulo-based analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  “Solar projects in the north of Chile are competitive
without subsidies” because of sunny weather and high local
electricity prices, Alves said today in a telephone interview.
“Chile is a key market for solar in Latin America.”  Construction of the 100-megawatt Amanecer Solar CAP project
began last month near the city of Copiapo in the Atacama region
and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014.  The project will cover 215 hectares (531 acres) and
include more than 300,000 solar panels, the statement showed.
It’s expected to be the largest solar photovoltaic power plant
in Latin America, SunEdison said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
