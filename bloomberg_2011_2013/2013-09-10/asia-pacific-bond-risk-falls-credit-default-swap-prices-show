The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment declined,

110 basis points as of 10:43 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The gauge is on course for its
lowest close since May 29, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 5 basis points to 135 as of
8:26 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. prices show. The benchmark, which has fallen 18 basis
points in the three trading days through yesterday, is set to
close at its lowest level since Aug. 14, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index retreated 1 basis point to 87
as of 9:24 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
measure last closed lower on May 24, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
