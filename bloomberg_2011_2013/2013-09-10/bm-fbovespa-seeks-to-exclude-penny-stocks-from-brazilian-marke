BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of
 Brazil ’s equity exchange, plans to no longer allow trading in
stocks valued at less than 1 real, potentially affecting about
10 percent of listings in Latin America’s biggest economy.  The exchange’s proposal, being considered by securities
regulators, would “mitigate the risk of the penny stocks
market, which is more subject to volatility, as any cent up or
down may represent a significant percentage, and of speculative
trading,” the company said in a statement to Bloomberg News.
Newspaper Valor Economico reported on the plan earlier today.  Among the companies that would be affected are former
billionaire  Eike Batista ’s  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA 
and  OSX Brasil SA. (OSXB3)  Fifty-five of the 485 stocks that are
currently trading on the Brazilian market are priced below 1
real, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Under the proposal, companies that are already listed will
have a period of 12 months after the rules are adopted to meet
the new requirements. Companies could choose to pursue reverse
stock splits, under which the number of outstanding shares is
reduced to increase the par value of the stock.  BM&FBovespa is scheduled to announce changes in the way it
determines the relative importance of individual stocks in the
Brazilian equity benchmark, the Ibovespa, by Sept. 13. OGX is
the only stock on the index to trade below 1 real.  To contact the reporter on this story:
