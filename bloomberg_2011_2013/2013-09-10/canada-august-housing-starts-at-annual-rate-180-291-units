Canadian  housing starts  in August
posted their biggest drop in seven months on fewer condominium
projects, the countryâ€™s federal housing agency said.  Starts totaled 180,291 units in August on a seasonally
adjusted annual basis, down 6.6 percent from 193,021 in July,
the Ottawa-based Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said on its
 website  today. Multiple unit starts such as condos fell 8.4
percent, while single home construction fell 0.9 percent.  While housing-market data are showing few signs of a hard
landing, some segments of the market have slowed. Home starts
have averaged 183,161 units so far this year, compared with
215,050 units in 2012.  Economists forecast a reading of 190,000 in August
according to the median of 21 responses to a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
