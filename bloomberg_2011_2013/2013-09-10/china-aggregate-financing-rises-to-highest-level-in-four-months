China’s broadest measure of new
credit was more than forecast in August as  money-supply  growth
quickened, data from the People’s Bank of China showed today.  Aggregate financing was 1.57 trillion  yuan 
($257 billion), the Beijing-based central bank said in a 
statement on its website. That compared with the 950 billion 
yuan median estimate of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg 
News and 1.25 trillion yuan a year earlier.  M2, the broadest gauge of money supply, rose 14.7 percent
from a year earlier, compared with the 14.6 percent median
estimate of analysts and 14.5 percent in July.  New yuan loans were 711.3 billion yuan, compared with the
730 billion yuan median estimate and 703.9 billion yuan in
August 2012. That represented a 45 percent share of aggregate
financing after about 87 percent in July, which was the highest
in almost two years following a government crackdown at shadow
banking aimed at limiting risks in the financial system.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
