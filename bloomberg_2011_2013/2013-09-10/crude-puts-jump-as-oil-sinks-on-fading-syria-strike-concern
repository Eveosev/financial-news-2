Crude oil puts increased and calls
dropped as underlying futures slid on fading chances the U.S.
will launch a military strike against  Syria  over its alleged use
of chemical weapons.  Implied volatility of puts protecting against a 10 percent
drop in November futures prices on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose to 28.62 percent at 3:55 p.m. from 28.29 percent
yesterday. Volatility for calls covering a 10 percent rise
slipped to 25.68 percent from 27.42.  “Now there looks like there is an exit on Syria and the
odds of immediate attack have gone down dramatically and you’re
buying puts,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago .  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery fell
$1.98, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $106.49 a barrel on the
Nymex. The front-month October contract sank $2.13 to $107.39.  Futures slid as  France  said it will submit a Russian-backed
plan to confiscate Syria’s chemical weapons to the  United
Nations , and as Interfax reported that Bashar al-Assad’s
government accepted the proposal. President  Barack Obama  asked
Democratic senators to delay a vote on authorizing military
strikes in Syria to allow time for talks on eliminating that
country’s chemical weapons, lawmakers said today.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
