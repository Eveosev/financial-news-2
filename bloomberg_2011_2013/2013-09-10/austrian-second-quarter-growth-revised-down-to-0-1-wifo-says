  Austria ’s economy expanded less
than estimated in the second quarter after export data showed
goods and services sold abroad grew less than initially
projected, the government-backed Wifo research institute said.  Gross domestic product  expanded 0.1 percent in the three
months through June, less than the 0.2 percent estimated by Wifo
last month, the Vienna-based institute said today in an e-mailed
statement. Exports increased by 0.2 percent in the period, 0.1
percent less than its earlier assessment, Wifo said.  “In Austria, business surveys and early indicators show
economic improvement in the near future, however to this point,
growth has remained subdued,” Wifo said.  Compared with the second quarter of last year, the economy
grew 0.2 percent if adjusted for inflation, down from Wifo’s
earlier 0.3 percent estimate. In June, Wifo cut its outlook for
Austrian growth this year to 0.4 percent, saying the persistent
weakness of the euro area would hit the Alpine republic’s
exports and investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
