Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  was sued by
the investment fund Phoenix Light SF Ltd. over alleged
misrepresentations in the offering of $362 million worth of
mortgage-backed securities.  Phoenix, based in Dublin, which took over claims to the
securities from five other investors that have since collapsed
or nearly collapsed, filed a complaint against Credit Suisse
today in state court in  Manhattan .  The Zurich-based bank made misrepresentations and omissions
about the credit quality of the loans underlying the securities
in offerings from 2005 to 2007, Phoenix alleged in the
complaint. Offering documents also failed to disclose that
Credit Suisse was privately betting that the securities would
default, Phoenix alleged.  The certificates “are now all rated at junk status or
below and are essentially worthless investments, while
defendants, on the other hand, have profited handsomely from
their roles in structuring, marketing and selling the
certificates,” Phoenix said in the complaint.  A Credit Suisse spokesman, Drew Benson, declined to comment
on the lawsuit.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , both
based in  New York , have also been sued by Phoenix Light over
alleged misrepresentations about loans backing securities. The
case is pending in Manhattan state court.  The case is Phoenix Light SF Ltd. v. Credit Suisse AG,
653123/2013, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
