Gasoline tumbled to a 10-week low
as crude oil futures sank on speculation the U.S. will not
strike  Syria .  Futures dropped as much as 2.5 percent. France said it will
submit a Russian-backed plan to confiscate Syria’s chemical
weapons to the  United Nations , as Interfax reported that Bashar
al-Assad’s government accepted the proposal. President  Barack
Obama  said on ABC News that a U.S. attack “absolutely” would
be put on hold if Syria followed through on the proposal.  “The market is reacting to a potential diplomatic solution
to the  Syria crisis , which is taking a potential war premium out
of the price,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “There are still several more
dollars of war risk premium in the market.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 4.89 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.7535 a gallon at 9:54 on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after touching $2.732, the lowest intraday price since
July 1. Trading volume was 71 percent above the 100-day average.  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery, which
on Sept. 6 reached the highest level since May 2011, dropped
$2.54, or 2.3 percent, to $106.98 a barrel on the Nymex. October
Brent crude sank $2.66 to $111.06 on the London ICE Futures
Exchange.  Deflating Risk  “This is deflating the geopolitical risk that had been
priced in,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “The market will go
back to stabilizing and reacting to other headlines.”  Obama, scheduled to address the nation tonight to make his
case for a military strike, expressed skepticism that Assad
would yield control of his weapons stocks. “We have to be
skeptical because this is not how we’ve seen them operate over
the last couple of years,” he said in a separate interview with
NBC News.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 44 cents to $8.62 a barrel while the
fuel’s  premium  over Brent gained 65 cents to $4.63.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to $3.564 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Retail gasoline is 26.4 cents below a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery fell 5.74
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $3.0609 a gallon on trading volume
that was 40 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI increased 11 cents to $21.56
a barrel while the  premium  over Brent increased 31 cents to
$17.56.  To contact the reporter on this story:
