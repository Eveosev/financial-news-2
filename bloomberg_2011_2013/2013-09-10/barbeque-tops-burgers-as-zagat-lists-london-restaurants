A barbecue restaurant with only 30 seats and no reservations is the best-value menu in  London  in the new Zagat Survey.  Pitt Cue Co. in Soho -- which often has long lines of customers waiting -- beats Honest Burgers, Pepper Tree and Spice Village for meals at 25 pounds ($39.30) or less, the New York-based guide says, citing reports from 10,271 diners.  The Wolseley remains the city’s most popular restaurant, followed by Hakkasan, according to an e-mailed release from Zagat today. The Hawksmoor steak house jumps to third place for popularity from 11th in last year’s guide, climbing over fish specialist J. Sheekey.  Heston Blumenthal ’s Dinner by Heston is in fifth place.  The Waterside Inn in Bray near London is judged to have the best service, beating the Ledbury.  The Waterside Inn also holds onto its No. 1 slot for top food, in front of Yashin Sushi (Japanese), Barrafina (Spanish), Gauthier Soho (French) and the Ledbury.  The guide, covering 1,290 restaurants, says Sketch Lecture Room & Library has the best decor and Masala Zone is the most popular chain.  On average, the London surveyors eat out 3.7 times a week and spend an average of 37.35 pounds per person. Poor service is the No. 1 dining irritant, followed by high prices.  The London survey says Italian remains the most popular cuisine, with 23 percent of votes, followed by Japanese (17 percent) and last year’s runner-up French (14 percent).  Google Inc. (GOOG)  spent $151 million in Sept. 2011 to acquire Zagat Survey LLC.  Mountain View , California-based Google, owner of the world’s largest search engine, is using acquisitions to add services and find new sources of advertising.
