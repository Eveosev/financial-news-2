Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , Europe’s
biggest water company, agreed to sell its 24.95 percent stake in
Berlinwasser to the state of Berlin for 590 million euros ($792
million) to near completion of a two-year divestment plan.  Veolia’s sale of its holding in  Germany ’s largest water
company will be supplemented by 12 million euros for
miscellaneous items, dividends and interest for the 2013
financial year, the Paris-based company said in a statement.  The divestment from Berlin’s water business is the latest
part of a 6 billion-euro asset-sale program that’s now almost
achieved, the utility said today. The sale is subject to
European Union antitrust approval as well as Berlin Senate and
Parliament approvals, said Veolia, whose shares have risen
almost 35 percent the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
