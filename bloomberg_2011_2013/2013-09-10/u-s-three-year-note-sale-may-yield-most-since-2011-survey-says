The Treasury Department’s $31
billion sale of three-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.920
percent, the highest level since May 2011, according to the
average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of six of the
Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in September 2016, yielded
0.920 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New
York time. Last month’s sale of the debt yielded 0.631 percent,
and the record auction low was 0.327 percent on Dec. 11, 2012.  The size of today’s offering is the lowest since January
2009 and the first reduction since October 2010. The Treasury
sold $32 of the notes at the past 35 sales after the size peaked
at $40 billion from November 2009 through April 2010. The U.S.
reduced the size of its offering of two-year securities last
month to $34 billion, from $35 billion at the previous 34 sales.  The Aug. 6 three-year note auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3.21, down from 3.35 the previous month. The
average ratio for the past 10 auctions was 3.36.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 41.4 percent of the notes at the
August sale, the most since August 2011. The average for the
past 10 auctions is 27.4 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 19
percent at the past 10.  Three-year notes have lost 0.7 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 3.8 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The three-year
securities returned 0.6 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall gained 2.2 percent.  Three Auctions  Today’s offering is the first of three note and bond
auctions this week totaling $65 billion. The government will
sell $21 billion in 10-year debt tomorrow and $13 billion in 30-year securities on Sept. 12.  The sales will raise $31.6 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $33.4 billion, according to
the U.S. Treasury.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade government securities with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
