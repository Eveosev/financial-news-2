General Motors Co. (GM)  is evaluating
bringing its Opel Adam subcompact car to the U.S., Opel Chief
Executive Officer Karl-Thomas Neumann told reporters at the
Frankfurt Motor Show.  Opel sells the Adam in  Europe  and can’t offer it in the
U.S. without making changes to meet U.S. regulations, Neumann
said. GM wouldn’t sell it as an Opel, he said, declining to say
which brand might carry the model. Detroit-based GM doesn’t
distribute Opels in the U.S., where it has four brands, down
from eight before its 2009 bankruptcy.  “We’re looking at it,” Neumann said today in response to
a reporter’s question. “We have to work on the car first.
That’s one of the issues we have to look at.”  GM Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson is trying to
leverage Opel and Buick to achieve greater scale and
efficiencies globally as he seeks several ambitious mid-decade
goals, including ending losses in Europe and boosting North
American profit margins. GM sells the Opel Mokka sport-utility
vehicle in the U.S. as the Buick Encore.  Opel started producing the Adam in  Germany  in January.
Akerson has said he wished the Adam, as well as the Opel Cascada
mid-size convertible, had been engineered to also be sold in the
U.S. as Buicks, saying they would’ve “addressed a different
demographic.”  Those two brands are used regionally to complement the
luxury Cadillac and mainstream Chevrolet brands. The largest
U.S. automaker also sells GMC trucks in  North America  and Wuling
and Baojun models in  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
