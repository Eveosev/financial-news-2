South Korea ’s won pared gains,
retreating from the strongest level since February, after the
central bank was suspected of selling the currency to limit
appreciation.  Government bonds  were little changed.  The currency was 0.2 percent stronger at 1,085.04 per
dollar as of 11:18 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier rose as much as 0.45 percent to 1.081.95,
before erasing the advance in the 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. period.
The won is still up 5.2 percent this quarter, the most among 24
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as overseas
investors boosted their holdings of the nation’s stocks by $4.8
billion. Global funds were net buyers of the securities today
for the 13th day in a row.  “Foreign funds are buying local stocks, which have
supported the won, based on optimism that global economies are
recovering,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “Authorities likely bought dollars which
slowed the won’s gain.”  Data today in  China , South Korea’s biggest export market,
is forecast to show industrial output grew in August at the
fastest pace this year, according to a Bloomberg survey. Bank of
Korea Director General Jung Yung Taek said last week economic
growth is accelerating as overseas sales improve. Shipments
increased 7.7 percent from a year earlier in August, the biggest
increase since January, official data show.  Intervention Risk  The won fell as much as 0.1 percent below yesterday’s
closing level after touching today’s high. The central bank
“must have intervened,” said Han Sung Min, a currency trader
at Busan Bank in Seoul. Jung Ho Seok, head of the Bank of
Korea’s Foreign Exchange Market Team, declined to comment on the
matter when contacted by phone today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 21 basis
points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 7.81 percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due June 2016
held steady at 2.95 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
The central bank will leave its benchmark  interest rate  at 2.5
percent at a Sept. 12 policy meeting, according to all 15
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
