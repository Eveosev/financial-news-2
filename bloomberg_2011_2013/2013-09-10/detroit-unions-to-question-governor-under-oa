Detroit’s public employee unions
will question  Michigan  Governor Rick Snyder under oath about his
role in authorizing the city to file the biggest U.S. municipal
bankruptcy after Snyder dropped his objections to being deposed.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes in Detroit said Snyder
can be interviewed for three hours by the unions and other
creditors opposing the bankruptcy. A state assistant attorney
general, Margaret A. Nelson, abandoned an effort to block the
deposition after Rhodes expressed skepticism in court today.  “We all have our roles to play,” Rhodes said.  Local affiliates of the United Auto Workers and the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees had
sought to question Snyder, state Treasurer Andrew Dillon and
other state officials about the city’s bankruptcy filing. The
unions and other creditors are trying to build a case for
throwing the city out of bankruptcy.  Under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, cities and
counties must prove they are eligible to stay in bankruptcy
after filing for court protection, unlike companies and
individuals.  The city must show that it can’t pay its bills as they come
due, intends to file a plan to adjust its debts, and either
tried to negotiate with creditors or was unable to do so before
the filing.  The case is City of  Detroit , 13-bk-53846, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).  To contact the reporters on this story:
