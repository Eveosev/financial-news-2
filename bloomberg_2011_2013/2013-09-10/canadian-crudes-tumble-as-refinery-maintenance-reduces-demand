Canadian crudes declined on the
 spot market  as refinery maintenance in  Canada  and the U.S.
Midwest reduced demand.  Western Canadian Select, a blend of heavy oil-sands
bitumen, weakened by 65 cents to a $25 discount to U.S.
benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil, according to Calgary oil
broker Net Energy Inc.  WCS has been trending lower since reaching $9.25 below WTI
June 12 amid supply disruptions in  Alberta . The discount
increased to $25.75 on Sept. 4, the widest in six months.  Maintenance at upgraders and refineries in Alberta and the
Midwest may reduce demand. Plants shutting units for work
include  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting, Indiana and Toledo, Ohio refineries.  Whiting shut a 66,000-barrel-a-day reformer unit for
planned maintenance, and the 160,000-barrel Toledo refinery
brought down a coker, a person familiar with the matter said,
who asked not to be named because the information isn’t public.  Suncor Energy Inc. said Aug. 1 that it’s planning four to
five weeks of maintenance on the 110,000-barrel-a-day Unit 2 at
the Fort McMurray  upgrader .  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said last week on a community hot
line that it shut its Scotford  refinery , which can process
97,870 barrels a day, for scheduled work.  Husky Energy Inc. (HSE)  is shutting the 82,000-barrel-a-day
Lloydminster  upgrader , which processes heavy crude into lighter
grades, for 45 days starting in early September, executives said
on an earnings call last month.  Northern Tier Energy LP (NTI) ’s 74,000-barrel-a-day St. Paul Park
 refinery  in Minnesota plans to halt a fluid catalytic cracker
during October, the company said during its earnings conference
call in August.  Syncrude, a Canadian light crude processed from oil-sands
bitumen, weakened by 15 cents to a $1.35-a-barrel discount to
WTI, Net Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
