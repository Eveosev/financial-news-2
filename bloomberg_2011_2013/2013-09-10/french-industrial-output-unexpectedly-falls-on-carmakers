 French  industrial production 
unexpectedly fell for a third month in July, led by automobile
manufacturing.  Industrial production declined 0.6 percent from the
previous month, when it dropped 1.4 percent, national statistics
office Insee in Paris said today. Economists forecast a 0.5
percent gain, according to the median of 22 estimates gathered
by  Bloomberg News . Automobile output plunged 11.2 percent.  France ’s economy  exited recession  in the second quarter,
growing 0.5 percent, the most since the first quarter of 2011.
Today’s industrial data is at odds with recent surveys
indicating manufacturing and confidence are starting to recover.  The “industrial production data should not be seen as a
sign that the French economy is heading towards another leg of
recession,” Annalisa Piazza, an analyst at Newedge Group in
 London . “That said, we need to be prepared for a bumpy recovery
ahead.”  Today’s report also showed that manufacturing output fell
0.7 percent in July from August and dropped 2.5 percent from a
year earlier. Total production declined 1.8 percent on the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
