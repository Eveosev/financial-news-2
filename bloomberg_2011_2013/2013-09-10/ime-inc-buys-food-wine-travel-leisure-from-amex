Time Inc. (TWX) , the largest magazine
publisher in the U.S., acquired  American Express Co. (AXP) ’s
publishing arm, which includes titles such as  Food & Wine  and
Travel & Leisure.  Time Inc. also adds Departures, Black Ink and Executive
Travel to its roster of  21 titles , the publisher announced today
in a statement. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  The magazine company is preparing to spin off from Time
Warner Inc. in the first quarter of 2014. Time Warner Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes announced plans in March to
separate Time Inc. -- his worst-performing  division  -- after an
unsuccessful effort to create a joint venture with  Meredith
Corp. (MDP) , publisher of women’s titles such as Ladies’ Home Journal.  In July, Bewkes named Joseph Ripp CEO of Time Inc. after a
four-month search.  “I am very excited about the possibilities for expanding
these world-class brands, along with the rest of our portfolio,
as we prepare to become an independent company,” Ripp said in a
note today to employees about the transaction.  As a public company, projections for New York-based Time
Inc.’s enterprise value -- or the sum of its equity and debt
minus cash -- range from $2.7 billion to about $4.9 billion,
according to six analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg in
July.  American Express, based in  New York , is selling the
magazines because banking regulations restrict the company from
non-financial activities, it said in the statement.  Time Warner shares advanced 1.1 percent to $62.94 at the
close in New York. The stock has risen 32 percent this year.
American Express  gained  1.3 percent to $74.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
