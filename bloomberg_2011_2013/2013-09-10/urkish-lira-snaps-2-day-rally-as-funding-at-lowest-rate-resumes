The lira weakened for the first
time in three days as the Turkish central bank resumed funding
for lenders at its lowest interest rate. Government bond yields
rose.  The lira depreciated 0.3 percent to 2.0292 per dollar at
10:53 a.m. in Istanbul, extending its loss in the last three
months to 6.3 percent, the steepest drop among emerging-market
currencies monitored by Bloomberg in Europe, the Middle East and
 Africa . Yields on the  two-year benchmark  notes rose nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 9.48 percent.  Turkey ’s central bank offered to lend 3 billion liras ($1.5
billion) at the benchmark 4.5 percent rate in its auction of
one-week repurchase agreements today, after refraining from
providing liquidity at that rate yesterday as part of its
additional tightening measures. The bank won’t hold its one-week
repo sale on Sept. 16, it said today.  “The biggest factor influencing the market is the central
bank’s resumption of repo funding,” Cem Tozge, a fund manager
at Ata Invest in Istanbul, said by telephone.  The Turkish economy expanded by 4.4 percent in the second
quarter, according to the Statistics office in Ankara. This
follows 2.9 percent growth in the first three months and exceeds
the 3.5 percent median forecast of eight analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
