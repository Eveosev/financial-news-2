Canadian  stocks  fell, after
touching the highest level in almost six months yesterday, as
energy and materials producers slumped amid signs of easing
tensions over  Syria  that weighed on commodity prices.  Yamana Gold Inc. slid 4.9 percent to C$10.96 as the price
of the precious metal plunged 2 percent in New York. Suncor
Energy Inc. dropped 1.6 percent after oil retreated on optimism
that Middle East supplies will not be disrupted.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 31.68
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,822.96 at 10:23 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark Canadian equity gauge rose 0.3 percent yesterday
to the highest since March 12.  Global stocks advanced today after France said it will
submit a Russian-backed plan to confiscate Syria’s chemical
weapons to the  United Nations , as Interfax reported that Bashar
al-Assad’s government accepted the proposal. U.S. President
 Barack Obama  will outline his intentions on Syria in a speech at
9 p.m. tonight in Washington.  In Canada, materials stocks plunged 1.4 percent and energy
producers dropped 0.4 percent. The two groups account for more
than 38 percent of the benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
