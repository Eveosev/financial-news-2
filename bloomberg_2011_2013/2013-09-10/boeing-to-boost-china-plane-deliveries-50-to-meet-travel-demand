Boeing Co. (BA)  will boost plane
deliveries to Chinese customers by 50 percent this year to meet
rising demand for air travel.  The planemaker will ship more than 120 aircraft to carriers
in the country, up from 80 last year,  Randy Tinseth , vice
president of marketing at Chicago-based Boeing, said today in an
interview with Susan Li on Bloomberg Television.  “We’ve seen strong domestic demand in China,” Tinseth
said. “The fundamentals are strong.”  Boeing raised its 20-year demand forecast for China’s
aircraft market last week, at least the fourth straight year in
which the company has increased its estimate for the world’s
second-biggest economy. The planemaker has maintained its sales
target for India, where aircraft demand is withstanding a record
drop in the value of the country’s currency, Chief Executive
Officer  James McNerney  said Sept. 7.  Chinese demand for overseas travel is also rising, Tinseth
said. The share of international traffic carried by Chinese
airlines is expected to climb to 27 percent of the world’s total
in 20 years from about 21 percent at present, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
