Asian  stocks  rose, extending the
longest rally in the benchmark index this year, as China’s
industrial production and retail sales beat estimates, adding to
signs the world’s second-largest economy is rebounding.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) , China’s biggest producer of the metal,
gained 3 percent in Hong Kong.  Komatsu (6301)  Ltd., Japan’s No. 1
construction-equipment maker, climbed 6.4 percent after the
Nikkei newspaper reported operating profit from its parts

Ltd. jumped 6 percent in  Tokyo , pacing gains among shipping
companies after a gauge of cargo rates posted its largest
advance in more than four years.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.2 percent to 137.2
as of 7:28 p.m. in Tokyo, capping a ninth day of gains and the
highest close since July 23. The gauge last week posted its
biggest weekly advance since April on signs the global economy
is recovering. Reports today showed factory output in China
accelerated by 10.4 percent in August from a year earlier, while
retail sales increased 13.4 percent, exceeding economist

production in China is picking up,” Evan Lucas, a Melbourne-based strategist at IG Markets, said in a telephone interview.
“Positive indicators from China coupled with what’s going on in
Japan really put Asia back on track, making the region a very
good investment case.”  Bull Market  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies

Sensex Index jumped 3.8 percent as the rupee strengthened.  The Topix surged 38 percent this year, with Japanese
equities performing the best among developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg. Shares have jumped amid optimism Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  can lead the country out of
deflation with stimulus and reforms.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.5
percent today. The equity gauge advanced 1 percent yesterday,
the most in a week, amid almost $15 billion in takeovers
involving U.S. companies.  Fed Stimulus  The  Federal Reserve  has said any reduction in stimulus will
be tied to a sustained recovery in U.S. employment. The central
bank will decide to cut its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases this month, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  holds a two-day meeting on Sept. 17-18.  “Fed tapering remains a concern that could push market
