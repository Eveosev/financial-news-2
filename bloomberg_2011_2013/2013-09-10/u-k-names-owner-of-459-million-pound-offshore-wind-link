Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
will operate the transmission link connecting the world’s
largest offshore wind farm, the U.K. energy regulator said.  Ofgem named The Blue Transmission group comprising Barclays
Infrastructure Funds Management Ltd. and a U.K. unit of
Mitsubishi to maintain and operate the link for the London Array
project for the next 20 years, it said in an e-mailed statement.
Half of the debt funding for the purchase was provided by the
 European Investment Bank , it said.  “With a value of 459 million pounds ($721 million), these
are the highest value assets to have been tendered under the
offshore regime to date, bringing the total value of new
investment attracted into the sector to over 1 billion pounds,”
Ofgem Chairman John Mogg said in the statement. The competitive
bidding process means running the link will cost consumers a
quarter less than previous projects, he said.  EON SE, Dong Energy A/S and Masdar Abu Dhabi Future Energy
Co. opened the 2.2 billion euro ($2.9 billion) London Array
project, the world’s largest marine wind farm, in July. It
comprises 175 turbines for an installed capacity of 630
megawatts.  Britain plans a 10-fold expansion in offshore wind by the
end of this decade as it seeks to curb polluting greenhouse gas
emissions and create jobs. The country wants 15 percent of its
energy to come from clean sources by 2020 from about 9.4 percent
now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
