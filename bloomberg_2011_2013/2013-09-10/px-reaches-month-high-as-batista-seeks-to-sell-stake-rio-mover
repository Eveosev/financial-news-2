MPX Energia SA (MPXE3)  jumped to the
highest in almost a month after the Brazilian energy producer
said founder  Eike Batista  is seeking to sell his stake.  MPX rose 4.8 percent to 6.18 reais at 11:09 a.m. in Sao
Paulo, the highest level since Aug. 12. MPX has dropped 43
percent this year as the former billionaire struggled to raise
cash for the Rio de Janeiro-based company he jointly controls
with  Germany ’s EON SE.  MPX “was notified by one of its controlling stakeholders,
Mr. Eike Fuhrken Batista, that he is in talks about a possible
sale of his shares,” the company said in a regulatory filing
today. An agreement hasn’t yet been signed, MPX said.  Batista, who listed six companies since 2006, is selling
assets ranging from oil fields to a logistics operator after
seeing more than $30 billion of his personal wealth disappear
since early 2012 because investors lost confidence in his
companies after delayed projects and rising debt.  EON  increased  its stake in MPX through a private placement
to 36 percent on July 4, making it the largest stakeholder in
the company as Batista stepped down as chairman. Grupo BTG
Pactual, the investment bank controlled by billionaire  Andre
Esteves , acquired 28.2 million MPX shares for $78.7 million, MPX
said Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
