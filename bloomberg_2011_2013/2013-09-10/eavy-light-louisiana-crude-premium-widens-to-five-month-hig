Heavy  Louisiana  Sweet oil
strengthened to a five-month high relative to its lighter
counterpart as more light U.S. shale oil reaches the state by
rail and sea.  HLS strengthened by 40 cents against Light Louisiana Sweet
at 1:34 p.m. to a premium of $1.15 a barrel, the highest level
since April 4. HLS strengthened by 50 cents relative to West
 Texas  Intermediate to a  premium  of $2.90 a barrel.  Louisiana received 750,189 barrels of crude from North
Dakota in 2012, up from 60,319 in 2011, according to Louisiana
 Department of Natural Resources data . The state has received
518,932 barrels from North Dakota so far this year. The
 Louisiana Offshore Oil Port  received 2.4 million barrels of oil
from Texas in June. LOOP received its first tanker of domestic
crude in August 2012.  “The premium for HLS versus LLS is going up as it
represents a heavier sweet crude oil that can be blended with
the lighter sweet crude oil from places such as the Eagle Ford
in order to produce a LLS quality crude oil for sale at St.
James,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  LOOP, the largest waterborne petroleum import terminal in
the U.S., last year made modifications to one of its three
offshore buoys to allow receipts from smaller domestic vessels,
such as those carrying Eagle Ford crude out of Texas. The  Port
of Corpus Christi, Texas,  shipped out 367,921 barrels a day of
crude a day in July, up from 3,860 in February 2012, according
to data from the port.  NuStar Energy LP (NS)  can unload 100,000 barrels a day of crude
at its rail terminal in St. James, Louisiana. The company mostly
receives Bakken oil there, Danny Oliver, senior vice president
of marketing and business development, said in June. The company
expects to open a second terminal in December.  Shale oil production from areas like the Bakken in  North
Dakota  and Eagle Ford in South Texas have driven  U.S. crude
production  to the highest level since October 1989.  To contact the reporter on this story:
