Mozambique ’s central bank
maintained its benchmark  interest rate  as inflation decelerated.  The permanent lending facility was kept at 8.75 percent,
the lowest since December 2008 when the rate was introduced, the
Maputo-based Banco de Mocambique said in a statement posted on
its website today.  Mozambique has cut the rate by 6 percentage points since
last year to stimulate the economy of the southern African
nation, site of the world’s largest discovery of natural gas in
the past decade. Annual inflation slowed for a third consecutive
month in August, decelerating to 4.3 percent, the statistics
agency said yesterday.  “The monetary policy committee saw a trend of a stronger
alignment of inflation with goals set for 2013 and 2014 and
considered important to maintain a prudent monetary policy
stance given prevailing risks in the international
environment,” the committee said.  The bank also maintained the lenders’ compulsory reserves
ratio at 8 percent and the deposit rate at 1.5 percent, it said.  The Monetary Policy Committee will make its next rate
decision on Oct. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
