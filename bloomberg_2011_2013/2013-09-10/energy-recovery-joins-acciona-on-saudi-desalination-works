  Energy Recovery Inc. (ERII) , whose clean
technologies help increase energy savings to the water industry,
will work with  Acciona SA (ANA)  on a 100,000-cubic-meter seawater
desalination plant being built in Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia’s  Marafiq Power & Water Utility Co . awarded
the Alcobendas, Spain-based Acciona a contract to design, build
and bring into service the reverse-osmosis plant by the end of
2014, San Leandro, California-based Energy Recovery said in a
statement. No terms were given. Construction on the plant in al-Jubail on the Saudi east coast began last year, it said.  Saudi Arabia, with the Arab world’s largest economy and a
population that’s quadrupled the past 40 years, is expanding
water projects to provide households with potable supplies as
well as industrial-scale plants including petrochemicals. As
more than 50 percent of the kingdom’s water comes from
desalination, this push has attracted companies such as  Veolia
Environnement (VIE)  SA and  Suez Environnement (SEV)  Co.  The world’s biggest producer of desalinated water spent
$1.1 billion on 128 water and sanitation works just in the
capital Riyadh in 2012. The Saudi Ministry of Water and
Electricity has 285 water projects listed kingdom-wide this year
on its official website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
