Brazilian wholesale prices are
rising faster than economists forecast, as a 14 percent slide in
the currency over the past six months pushes up the cost of
imports and commodities.  Wholesale, consumer and construction prices as measured by
the  IGP-M index  rose 1.02 percent in the last 10 days of August
from the same period a month earlier, the Getulio Vargas
Foundation  said  today. The gain was bigger than forecast by all
13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median estimate was
0.67 percent.  The cost of components for manufacturers, many of which are
imported, rose 1.95 percent between Aug. 21 and 31 compared with
a 1.31 percent rise in the 10-day period at the end of July.  Raw
materials , including commodity exports priced in dollars like
soy and iron ore, rose 3.3 percent.  “Wholesale inflation shows the weak dollar is affecting
prices,”  Francisco Carvalho , head of  currency trading  at BGC
Liquidez, said in an interview. “ We now need to find out
whether it will pass-through to consumer prices.”  The real gained 0.20 percent to 2.2715 per U.S dollar at
11:08 a.m. local time. Swap rates maturing in January 2015 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.32 percent.  The central bank said last week that the recent currency
weakness can pressure inflation that has been running above the
government’s 4.5 percent target since 2010. Prices jumped 6.09
percent in August from a year ago, according to the benchmark
IPCA index.  The IGP-M index is a barometer of the exchange rate’s pass-through effect on inflation because 60 percent of the gauge is
weighted in wholesale prices. In the past 12 months, the index
has risen 3.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
