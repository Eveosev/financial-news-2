Chicago  gasoline strengthened
against  New York  futures after  BP Plc (BP/)  was said to shut units at
two Midwest refineries.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in Chicago
gained 2.5 cents to a premium of 6 cents a gallon to futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:37 p.m. after yesterday
falling to a two-week low.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  added 0.5
cent to 1 cent a gallon below futures.  Differentials widened after BP was said to shut a 66,000-barrel-a-day reformer at the  Whiting, Indiana, refinery , the
largest in the U.S. Midwest. A coker was also shut at the
companyâ€™s  Toledo, Ohio, plant , according to a person familiar
with operations.  Reformers convert heavy naphtha into high-octane
blendstocks. Crackers convert residual oil into higher-value
light products and feedstocks. The two plants have a combined
capacity of 580,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , swelled 79 cents to $14.17 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  same spread  in Group 3, a region spanning north from
Tulsa, Oklahoma, to  Minnesota  and  North Dakota , declined 20
cents to $15.81. Spot gasoline weakened in the area as  CVR
Energy Inc. (CVI)  restarted a fluid catalytic cracker at its
Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  in Group 3 retreated 1
cent to a premium of 10 cents a gallon, the  lowest level  since
Aug. 30.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel  strengthened 0.37 cent to
2.75 cents above ULSD futures.  FCCs process vacuum gasoil into higher-value gasoline and
other lighter products. The  Coffeyville refinery  has a capacity
of 120,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
