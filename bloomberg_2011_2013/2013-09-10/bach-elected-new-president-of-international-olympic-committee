 Thomas Bach of Germany was elected
president of the International Olympic Committee, replacing
 Jacques Rogge  as the head of one of sport’s most powerful
groups.  Bach, 59, beat five other candidates to become the ninth
president of the governing body that sets up the Olympic Games.
He’ll serve an eight-year term, with the option for another four
with the support of the IOC.  Rogge, a 71-year-old who stabilized the IOC for 12 years as
it recovered from corruption scandals, is retiring.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
