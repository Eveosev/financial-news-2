Taiwan ’s dollar rose to the
strongest level since June after exports increased for a fourth
month and global funds accelerated purchases of local equities.  Overseas shipments , which account for around three-quarters
of the island’s gross domestic product, climbed 3.6 percent in
August from a year earlier, while the  trade surplus  was $4.6
billion from $3.2 billion the month before, official data showed
yesterday. Foreign funds bought $2 billion more Taiwanese shares
than they sold in the last eight trading days, taking net
purchases this year to $2.9 billion, exchange data show.  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.5 percent to NT$29.68
against the greenback as of 9:41 a.m. in Taipei, the strongest
level since June 7, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The island’s
dollar rallied 0.9 percent in the past month, the most after
South Korea’s won among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies.  “Now that major economies like  Europe , the U.S. and  China 
are recovering, funds flow toward places that benefit from
exports, such as Taiwan,” said Andrew Tsai, an economist at KGI
Securities in Taipei. “You can see the Korean won and the
 Taiwan dollar  have been appreciating since the end of August due
to equity allocation.”  The island’s dollar was trading 0.5 percent stronger 18
minutes before the 4 p.m. close yesterday, and ended 0.3 percent
higher. The central bank has sold the currency in the run-up to
the finish on most days since March 2012, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.6 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, decreased 13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, to 4.05 percent.  The yield on bonds due September 2023 was little changed at
1.788 percent in when-issued trading, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The notes are due to be officially auctioned
on Sept. 14. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at
0.386 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
