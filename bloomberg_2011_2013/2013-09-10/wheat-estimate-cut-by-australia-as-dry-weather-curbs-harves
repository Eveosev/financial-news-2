Australia  reduced its wheat
production forecast after dry weather in the biggest producing
states harmed crops, curbing supplies available for export from
the world’s third-biggest shipper.  Farmers are set to harvest 24.5 million metric tons of
wheat in 2013-2014 from 25.4 million tons estimated in June and
22.1 million tons a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said in a
 report  today. Exports may reach 19.5 million tons in the year
starting Oct. 1 from 19.6 million tons predicted in June and
19.8 million tons a year earlier, it said.  Wheat lost 18 percent this year on expectations increased
production in Canada and  Russia  will boost global output to a
record. World  food prices  fell for a fourth month in August to
the lowest level in more than a year on lower grain prices as
corn slumped 34 percent this year and soybeans lost 4.7 percent,
according to the  United Nations . A smaller Australian crop is
“a major risk for the world” and fewer exports may help push
prices higher, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  “Below average rainfall since mid-winter in parts of New
South Wales, Queensland and the northern growing areas of
 Western Australia  has adversely affected crop development,” the
bureau’s executive director  Paul Morris  said in a statement.
“Temperatures and rainfall have generally been favorable in
 South Australia , Victoria and the southern parts of Western
Australia.”  Western Australian growers will collect 7.3 million tons in
2013-2014 compared with 8.8 million tons forecast in June, the
bureau said. That will still put the state ahead of last year’s
top producer New South Wales, which will harvest 7.2 million
tons from 7.6 million tons estimated in June, it said.  Abares raised its area planted to wheat to 13.71 million
hectares (33.9 million acres) from 13.68 million hectares
estimated in June. Australia’s canola production is forecast at
3.3 million tons from 3.2 million tons projected in June, the
bureau said. Barley output is expected to total 7.7 million tons,
up from a June estimate of 7.4 million tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
