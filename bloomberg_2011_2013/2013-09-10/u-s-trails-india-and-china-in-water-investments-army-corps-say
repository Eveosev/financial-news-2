The  United States  is trailing India
and China in water investments in terms of percentage of gross
domestic product, Bloomberg BNA said today, citing  Army Corps  of
Engineers commanding general Thomas Bostick.  Increasing water infrastructure investments can improve
security and economic stability and help curb conflict, the
report cited Bostick as saying at a water-security conference in
Washington. The U.S. investment in water infrastructure is less
than 2 percent of GDP compared with China’s 7 percent and
India’s 5 percent, he told the Water Security and Conflict
Prevention conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
