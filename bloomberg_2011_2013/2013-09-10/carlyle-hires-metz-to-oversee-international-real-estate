Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the second-biggest manager of investment alternatives to traditional stocks
and bonds, named Adam Metz as a managing director to oversee
international real estate.  Metz will start in the new position next month at Carlyle’s

Carlyle, the largest alternative-investment company after
Blackstone Group LP, manages $12.3 billion in 10 property funds
and related vehicles that focus on Asia, Europe and the U.S.  “I look forward to working with the teams to develop new
products that capture market opportunities and satisfy investor
demand,” Metz, 52, said in the statement.  Before advising TPG, Metz’s career included being chief
executive officer of  General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the No. 2
U.S. shopping-mall landlord. He has a master’s degree in
management from Northwestern University and a bachelor’s in
history from Cornell University, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
