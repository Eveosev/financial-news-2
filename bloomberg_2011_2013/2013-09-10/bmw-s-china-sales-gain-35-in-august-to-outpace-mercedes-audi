Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest premium automaker, increased sales in China at a
faster pace than  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s
Audi last month.  BMW Group deliveries in China rose 35 percent to 34,166
units in August, the Munich-based automaker said in a  statement 
yesterday. Mercedes and Audi, which include  Hong Kong  in their
China sales figures, posted gains of  27 percent  and  23 percent ,
respectively, according to the companies.  The three German luxury automakers, which all build cars in
China, have quadrupled their local production in the last five
years and now account for about 75 percent of the premium cars
sold in the world’s biggest auto market, LMC data show. BMW has
grown faster than Mercedes and Audi in  China  in the past two
years and has projected that the country will surpass the U.S.
to become its largest single market this year.  The maker of the 3- and 5-series sedans is seeking
government approval to start the third phase of its assembly
plant in Shenyang in northeast China and boost its annual
production capacity to 400,000 vehicles.  Audi, the best-selling premium brand in China, sold 42,778
vehicles in the country. For the first eight months, the
automaker delivered 312,683 units in the country, keeping it on
pace to meet its 450,000-vehicle sales target for this year.  Mercedes, which counts the Smart and Maybach brands in its
China numbers, sold 18,087 vehicles last month. The company
merged two competing distribution networks in the country and
has said it plans to open 75 new dealerships this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
