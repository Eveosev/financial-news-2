U.S. prosecutors are seeking to
seize  New York  real estate allegedly used by a Russian criminal
organization to launder funds derived from a $230 million  tax
fraud , according to a complaint filed in  Manhattan .  The civil action also seeks to impose money-laundering
penalties for the full amount of the scheme on companies set up
by the organization, whose members allegedly included corrupt
Russian government officials, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said.  “Today’s forfeiture action is a significant step towards
uncovering and unwinding a complex money laundering scheme
arising from a notorious foreign fraud,” Bharara said today in
a statement. “As alleged, a Russian criminal enterprise sought
to launder some of its billions in ill-gotten rubles through the
purchase of pricey Manhattan real estate.”  Prosecutors claim the organization used sham lawsuits
against the Hermitage Fund, an investment fund operating in
 Russia , to generate phony money judgments that were then used to
claim tax refunds by members of the ring posing as Hermitage
officials. The fraud was uncovered by attorneys hired by
Hermitage, including Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, according
to Bharara. Magnitsky was later arrested in retaliation and died
in pretrial custody, Bharara said.  The case is U.S. v. Prevezon Holdings Ltd., 13-cv-6326,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
