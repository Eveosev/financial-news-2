Gold’s outlook is bearish while
prices stay below the August high and the metal may fall toward
the 34-month low of $1,180.50 an ounce set in June, according to
technical analysis by Commerzbank AG.  Bullion rose in three so-called corrective Elliott ABC
Waves that probably ended with the three-month high of $1,433.83
on Aug. 28, the bank said in a report today. Targets lower
include the $1,352 to $1,322 area consisting of a support line,
the July high and April and May lows, and the 55-day moving
average, the bank said. A drop below the August low at about
$1,273 may push prices to the $1,200 to $1,100 area, it said.  “We will stick to our bearish view while gold trades
below” August’s high,  Axel Rudolph , a technical analyst at
Commerzbank in  London , said in the report. “While no daily
chart close above this high is seen, we expect the gold price to
fall back to and beyond this year’s” low by the end of 2013, or
the beginning of next year, he said.  Prices are heading for the first annual drop in 13 years as
some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value and
on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will curb stimulus. Gold for
immediate delivery slipped 18 percent this year to $1,369.04 by
12:28 p.m. in London. While it rebounded from the 34-month low
set June 28, it’s trading 29 percent below September 2011’s
record price of $1,921.15.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. The Elliott Wave theory seeks to
predict moves by dividing past trends into sections, or waves.  To contact the reporter for this story:
