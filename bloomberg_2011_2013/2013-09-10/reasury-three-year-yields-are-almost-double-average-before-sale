Treasuries declined for the first
time in three days as refuge demand waned on speculation a
Russian proposal for Syria to put its chemical weapons under
international control will avert a U.S. military strike.  Notes fell even after an  auction  of $31 billion in three-year debt drew a lower-than-forecast yield. Ten-year yields
approached 3 percent after reaching that level last week for the
first time since 2011 amid bets the  Federal Reserve  will trim
its $85 billion-a-month in asset purchases at a meeting next
week. Verizon Communications Inc. prepared to issue as much as
$50 billion of debt to take full control of its wireless unit.  “We’ve seen a lot of response to the headlines today that
has caused very choppy trading,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 21 primary
dealers obligated to bid at Treasury auctions. “We are in the
midst of trying to find a new range for rates. We should see
higher yields, but at a slow pace.”  Ten-year  yields  climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.96 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data, and reached 2.97
percent. They closed yesterday at 2.91 percent. They touched
3.005 percent Sept. 6, the highest since July 2011. The price of
the 2.5 percent note due in August 2023 dropped 14/32, or $4.38
per $1,000 face amount, to 96 1/32.  Yields on current  three-year  notes rose four basis points
to 0.89 percent after touching 0.98 percent on Sept. 6, the
highest level since May 2011. They averaged 0.45 percent over
the past year.  Volume Rises  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , increased 43 percent to
$349 billion. The figure is down from a 2013 high of $662
billion on May 22 and up from a low of $148 billion on Aug. 9.
The 2013 average is $315 billion.  Thirty-year bond  yields  increased four basis points to 3.89
percent and touched 3.9 percent. They briefly declined one basis
point to 3.84 percent.  The long-bond yields may have fallen as dealers sold more
of the securities than necessary to lock in protection from
interest-rate volatility as Verizon prepared to sell bonds,
leading to an unwind of some of the Treasury sales, said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities USA Inc.  Verizon, which controls the largest U.S. wireless carrier,
is planning an eight-part, dollar-denominated initial offering
this week that may exceed Apple Inc.’s record $17 billion sale
in April, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
The debt is for a $130 billion transaction to acquire full
control of  Verizon Wireless , the most profitable U.S. mobile
carrier, from Vodafone Group Plc.  Factors Combining  “The Syrian concerns have receded and the market is back
to focusing on tapering and dealing with the added duration
issues from the Verizon deal, all of which are combining to give
us somewhat higher yields,” said  Scott Graham , Chicago-based
head of government-bond trading at Bank of Montreal’s BMO
Capital Markets unit, a primary dealer. “The three-year note
auction benefited from the steep selloff and higher yields we’ve
seen in that sector.”  The notes sold at today’s auction yielded 0.913 percent,
compared with a forecast of 0.920 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of six primary dealers. The yield was the highest in a
three-year debt sale since May 2011. The Treasury cut the size
of today’s offering from $32 billion, which had been the monthly
auction amount since October 2010.  Auction Participation  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of debt offered, was 3.29, versus
3.21 at the August sale and an average ratio of 3.36 at the past
10 offerings.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 33.1 percent of the notes sold today,
compared with an average of 27.4 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 20 percent of the
notes, the most since March. The average at the past 10 auctions
was 19 percent.  Investors bid $2.88 for each dollar of the $1.474 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $21 billion in 10-year notes
tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Sept. 12.  Treasuries fell earlier on the proposal to avoid U.S.
military action in  Syria . Russia urged the Middle East nation to
turn over its arsenal of chemical weapons to international
control. The plan offers a possible diplomatic solution after an
Aug. 21 chemical attack the U.S. and allies say was carried out
by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.  High Volatility  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch  MOVE index  was 101.81 today, the seventh
consecutive day above 100, the longest stretch since November
2011. It touched a two-month high of 114.19 on Sept. 5. The
average over the past year is 67.71.  Bonds gained yesterday on speculation that Sept. 6 data
showing lower-than-forecast job growth may prompt the Fed to be
less aggressive in curbing stimulus this month.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his colleagues will decide
at their Sept. 17-18 meeting to reduce purchases of Treasuries
to  $35 billion  from $45 billion while maintaining mortgage-bond
buying at  $40 billion , according to the median of 34 responses
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists on Sept. 6. Policy
makers are discussing whether the  U.S. economy  has improved
enough to start reducing the purchases.  Demand for safety also waned today as data showed  China ’s
industrial output grew at the fastest pace in 17 months. It rose
10.4 percent in August from a year earlier, the National Bureau
of Statistics said in a statement in Beijing today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
