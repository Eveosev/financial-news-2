Princeton University topped  Harvard
University  in U.S. News and World Reportâ€™s 2014 rankings of the
best U.S. academic research institutions, the 11th year in a row
the two schools led the list.  Harvard and Princeton tied for the top spot last year.  Yale
University  was third for 2014, followed by Columbia University,
while  Stanford University  and the University of Chicago tied for
fifth place, according to the  list  released today by the online
magazine.  The rankings, begun in 1983 and based on criteria such as
graduation rate, reputation and class size, can be influential
with students, parents and donors. Its impact has led some
schools to misreport data or skew the results of a reputation
survey.  Last year, Emory University, Claremont McKenna College and
George Washington University said they inflated SAT entrance
exam scores or the percentage of incoming freshmen that
graduated near the top of their high school class when reporting
data to U.S. News.  The highest ranked public university is the University of
California, Berkeley, tied for 20th with private schools Emory
and  Georgetown University .  The top liberal arts colleges were unchanged from a year
ago, with Williams College in first, followed by Amherst College
and Swarthmore College.  To contact the reporter on this story:
