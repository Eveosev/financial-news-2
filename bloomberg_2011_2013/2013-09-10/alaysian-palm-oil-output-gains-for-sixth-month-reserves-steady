Palm oil production in  Malaysia 
gained for a sixth month in August, while stockpiles in the
world’s second-largest producer missed analysts’ expectations,
staying near a two-year low, official data showed.  Output gained 3.6 percent to 1.74 million metric tons from
July, the highest since December, according to data from the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Inventories were 1.67 million tons,
little changed from July, and 1.2 percent higher than June which
was the lowest level since March 2011. That compares with the
median estimate of 1.71 million tons for reserves in a Bloomberg
survey published last week. Shipments gained 7.4 percent to 1.52
million tons, while imports tumbled 85 percent to 7,533 tons.  Prices of the most-consumed cooking oil have dropped 20
percent in the past year as supplies beat demand. While palm is
produced year-round, output typically accelerates in this half
because of growing cycles. Production this month will be “much
higher” than August, when growth slowed because of the Eid
festival holidays, according to  Ben Santoso , an analyst at DBS
Vickers Securities Pte. in  Singapore . Eid marks the end of the
Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  “Going into September to October, production may spike in
a stronger fashion,” Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance
Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone from Kuala Lumpur. “There
is a chance for inventories to rise in coming months, however,
it won’t be a very significant increase.”  Palm oil for November delivery dropped 2.1 percent to 2,348
ringgit ($718) a ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, the
steepest drop at close for the most-active contract since July
25. Futures jumped 7.5 percent in August, the biggest monthly
gain since December 2010 as a weaker ringgit against the dollar
boosted export prospects.  Shipments from Malaysia advanced 11 percent to 462,671 tons
in the first 10 days of September from the same period last
month, Intertek said today.  World  stockpiles  of the oil that’s used in everything from
candy to biofuel will surge 21 percent to a record 9.7 million
tons by the end of 2013-2014, while  demand  expands 4.6 percent,
the least in 12 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
