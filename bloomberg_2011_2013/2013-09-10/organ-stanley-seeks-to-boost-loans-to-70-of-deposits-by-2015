Morgan Stanley (MS) , which is set to
receive another $57 billion of deposits from Citigroup Inc. as
part of its Smith Barney purchase, plans to accelerate lending
to put those funds to use.  Morgan Stanley targets a loan-to-deposit ratio of about 70
percent in 2015, compared with about 55 percent last year,
according to a presentation on the firmâ€™s website. Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat is scheduled to speak to investors
today at a conference in  New York .  In addition to mortgages and securities lending to
individual clients, the bank will boost commercial real estate,
corporate and warehouse lending, the presentation shows. Each of
those business lines has an expected return on equity of at
least 15 percent, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
