A 118.28-carat white diamond is estimated to sell for more than $28 million at auction in  Hong Kong  next month. The price, if achieved, would be a record for any colorless gem at a public sale.  The oval D-color Flawless Type IIa stone, the largest of its type to appear at auction, will be sold by  Sotheby’s (BID)  on Oct. 7 as part of its 40th-anniversary events in  Asia . Only four other white diamonds of this quality weighing more than 100 carats have appeared at public sales, the New York-based company said.  The world’s biggest round “fancy vivid” blue diamond, called “The Premier Blue” and weighing 7.59 carats, carries a minimum valuation of $19 million at the same Hong Kong auction.  Rare gemstones are both status symbols and hedges against volatility in the financial markets, and their prices are rising. Colored stones, which account for about 0.01 percent of mined diamonds, command the highest price per carat.  Here is a list of the world’s five most expensive diamonds sold at auction. All prices include auction house fees.  1. The “Graff Pink”  Sale price: $45.6 million, 45.4 million Swiss francs.
