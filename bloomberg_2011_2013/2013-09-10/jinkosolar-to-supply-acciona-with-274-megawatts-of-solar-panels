JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS) , the Chinese
solar-panel maker that last month reported its first profit
since 2011, agreed to supply 274 megawatts of modules to  Acciona
SA (ANA)  for projects initially in South Africa and Australia.  Jinko will provide 94 megawatts of panels for a solar farm
in Northern Cape Province in South Africa, which will be one of
the three biggest on the African continent upon completion, the
company said today in a statement. It will also supply 24
megawatts for the Royalla photovoltaic power plant in Austraila.  The rest of the supply is subject to further talks between
the two companies, Jinko said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
