Crocs Inc. (CROX) , a maker of plastic
clogs, fell after cutting its third-quarter profit and sales
forecasts, citing weakness in the Americas region.  The shares  declined  2.2 percent to $13.31 at the close in
New York. The stock has dropped 7.5 percent this year.  Crocs, which plans to open 90 locations around the world
this year with about half in  Asia , said orders in the wholesale
unit and performance in the direct-to-consumer business in the
Americas have been below expectations. That weakness was partly
countered by stronger-than-anticipated revenue and comparable
store performance in the Asia Pacific and Europe regions, the
Niwot, Colorado-based company said today in a statement.  Net income for the period ending Sept. 30 will be 15 cents
to 18 cents a share, down from a prior forecast for as much as
23 cents, Crocs said. Analysts  projected  22 cents, the average
of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue will be $285 million to $295 million, down from the
$300 million to $310 million predicted in July. Analysts
predicted $305.1 million, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
