Ethanol advanced against gasoline
on concern that demand for corn as the harvest begins will raise
prices for the grain, boosting the cost of making the additive.  The spread, or discount, tightened 7.97 cents to 84.07
cents a gallon as futures jumped for December corn. Ethanol
 stockpiles  have been at record seasonal lows this year since
March, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Everybody’s so hungry for new corn that there’s going to
be a line to buy,” said  Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investments LLC in  Minneapolis . “There’s legitimate
concern from the ethanol producer that he’s going to be able to
source corn.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery rose 1.3 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $1.895 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures have dropped 14 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery declined 6.67 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.7357 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  “Ethanol stockpiles are very low and the spread with
gasoline is very wide,” Ward said. “That makes ethanol look
attractive.”  Inventories slipped 0.2 percent to 16.2 million barrels in
the week ended Aug. 30 from the previous week, data from the
U.S. Energy Information Administration show. That was the lowest
level since July 5.  Falling Production  Production tumbled a third week to 819,000 barrels a day,
the smallest run rate since March, according to the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  Imports have averaged 22,000 barrels a day this year, up
from 17,000 during the same period in 2012, EIA data show.  Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S., with one
bushel making at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  Corn for December delivery climbed 5.5 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $4.69 a bushel in Chicago. September corn slipped
2.5 cents to $4.7475.  A 2007 energy law, known as the Renewable Fuels Standard,
calls for the U.S. to consume 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol
this year. Compliance is tracked by Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, that are attached to each gallon of biofuel
and that can be traded among companies.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  fell 1 cent to 67 cents, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, decreased 2 cents to 74
cents.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the world’s largest independent
refining company, called on the Obama administration to waive
the country’s biofuel target immediately, saying the cost to
reach it has skyrocketed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
