Sanford “Sandy” Weill, the former
chairman and chief executive officer of  Citigroup Inc. (C) , and his
wife, Joan, gave $100 million to  Cornell University ’s medical
school, bringing their total donations to the university to more
than $600 million.  The gift, which also came from the Weill Family Foundation,
will fund research into cures for cancer, diabetes, obesity and
metabolic disorders, Weill Cornell Medical College in New York
said today in a  statement  on its website. The institution was
renamed for the Weills in 1998.  Sandy Weill, 80, received a bachelor’s degree from Cornell
in 1955 before a career in finance that spanned half a century
and made him a fortune that Forbes estimated at $1.5 billion in
2006. The Weills’ gifts to Cornell include $100 million in 1998
for a capital campaign and $250 million in 2009 for biomedical
research. They have also donated more than $100 million to
 Carnegie Hall , in New York, where  Sandy Weill  is chairman of the
board.  “We are immensely proud of what Weill Cornell has achieved
-- and what more we can accomplish in the years to come,” Weill
said in the statement.  Cornell was founded in 1865 in Ithaca, New York. The
university, a member of the  Ivy League , has about 22,400
students in Ithaca,  New York City  and Qatar. Graduates include
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Indian
industrialist Ratan Tata.  To contact the reporter on this story:
