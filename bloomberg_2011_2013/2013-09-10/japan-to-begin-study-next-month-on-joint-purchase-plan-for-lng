Japan , the world’s largest importer
of liquefied natural gas, will begin a study next month on how
to link domestic and foreign buyers in purchasing groups to
reduce energy costs.  The country will work on details to enable joint
procurement of LNG by linking up buyers to increase their
bargaining power against suppliers, Ryo Minami, a director for
the oil and natural gas division at the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry, said in an interview at a conference today
in  Tokyo .  LNG in Japan costs four times as much as in the U.S.,
Toshimitsu Motegi, trade and industry minister, said at the
conference. Bringing down LNG prices is a pressing issue for
Japan, he said.  “By combining buyers from Japan and other countries, we
can increase the volume needed to gain bargaining power,”
Minami said. “We will conduct hearings for local utilities and
gas companies as well as foreign companies and plan to complete
details for the joint-purchasing program soon.”  One of the barriers for group buying is the destination
clauses that are now part of most LNG contracts. They limit the
ports or countries that can receive a given LNG cargo. Suppliers
from the U.S. and  Canada  are expected to be more flexible on
destinations, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
