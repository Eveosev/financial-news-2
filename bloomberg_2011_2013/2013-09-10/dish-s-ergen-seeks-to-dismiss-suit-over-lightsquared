Dish (DISH)  Network Corp. Chairman Charles Ergen can dismiss a lawsuit brought by Philip A. Falcone’s
Harbinger Capital Partners LLC against him over how he bought
debt in LightSquared Inc. and may face claims from the company
itself, a judge said.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in  Manhattan  today
dismissed allegations against some Ergen entities named in the
lawsuit, and said that while Harbinger doesn’t have claims
against Ergen, LightSquared can bring a complaint on similar
grounds.  “To the extent that it has legs, I think it belongs to the
debtor,” Chapman said. Ergen has said the suit is an attempt to
derail his $2.22 billion cash offer to buy LightSquared, an
owner of wireless spectrum, in bankruptcy. Chapman said the
trading and bidding issues were like “apples and oranges” and
wouldn’t affect each other.  Harbinger sued Ergen and Dish in August, claiming he’s
fraudulently trying to take control of LightSquared, which
provides broadband network services, by having an entity he
controls, SP Special Opportunities LLC, buy large amounts of its
debt. It wasn’t disclosed what entity was buying the debt and
the trades took a long time to close, according to the
complaint.  Ergen and SP said in a motion to dismiss the case that they
made no “false representations” about the purchases, so there
was no fraud.  EchoStar Named  Harbinger’s lawsuit also named  EchoStar Corp. (SATS)  and L-Band
Acquisition LLC, another Ergen entity, which made the offer to
buy LightSquared’s assets. According to the motion to dismiss,
Dish and EchoStar don’t have an ownership interest in SP.  Chapman dismissed Harbinger’s complaints against Dish,
EchoStar and L-Band. She said LightSquared can re-plead the
complaints against Ergen and SP.  James Dugan, a lawyer for Ergen, told Chapman today that
the lawsuit called to mind a “Frankenstein monster” or “Alice
in Wonderland.”  “What we see is an equity holder who stands to lose
control of his company battling at any cost to retain control,”
Dugan said, calling the lawsuit an attempt to disqualify Ergen’s
bid. Harbinger is LightSquared’s largest equity owner.  Ergen’s Sound Point and its related SP Special
Opportunities fund amassed $1 billion in LightSquared debt while
rebuffing inquiries from Harbinger about who was behind the
“corporate facade,” according to Falcone’s complaint.  26 Transactions  The debt was accumulated through 26 separate transactions
during one year, and Ergen’s entity didn’t say it was buying
because such an announcement might have caused the market to
price the debt higher, Dugan told Chapman.  David Friedman, a lawyer for Harbinger, said the company
didn’t know who was buying its debt despite rumors that it was
Ergen.  Chapman said LightSquared should have come to her court
earlier and expressed concern that a party was buying a blocking
position in its debt,  “No one came in and said: ‘Our capital structure is being
raided. People are buying our debt and no one is saying who it
is.’ That never happened,” Chapman said.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , filed for
bankruptcy in May 2012, listing assets of $4.48 billion and debt
of $2.29 billion.  It petitioned for bankruptcy protection to reorganize while
seeking U.S. approval to use its wireless spectrum. Regulators
blocked the service in 2012 after GPS-device makers and users,
including the U.S. military and commercial airlines, said
LightSquared’s signals would confound navigation gear.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
