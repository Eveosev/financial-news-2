Germany ’s power market is showing
signs of declining security of supply, according to Jochen Homann, the president of grid regulator Bundesnetzagentur.  The nation’s four grid operators, especially Tennet TSO
GmbH and 50Hertz Transmission GmbH, needed to intervene to
stabilize the grids during 7,200 hours last year, compared with
1,800 hours in 2010, Homann said today at an energy conference
in Munich. The interventions are a result of renewable
generation capacity putting a strain on grids, he said.  Germany boosted its share of power supply from renewable
energy sources such as wind and solar to 23 percent last year
from 17 percent in 2010 as  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government
seeks to shut all nuclear reactors by 2022. Renewable energy’s
reliance on fickle wind and sunshine has has led to more
intermittent power flows in the grid that operators need to
regulate to prevent outages.  “There are alarming signs that point to a decline of
security of supply, such as a higher number of interventions
into the grids by operators, the use of winter reserve plants
and the reduction of renewable output on some days,” Homann
said. “A blackout in Germany is not imminent. Neither is a
brownout, where single users of power are taken offline
selectively.”  Germany needs to expand its power grids and needs to change
its renewable energy law to boost security of supply, Homann
said. The law grants uncapped subsidies for operators of
renewable projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
