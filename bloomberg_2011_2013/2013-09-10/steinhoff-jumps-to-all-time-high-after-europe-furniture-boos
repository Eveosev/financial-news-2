Steinhoff International Holdings
Ltd. (SHF) , the owner of  France ’s Conforma furniture chain, rose to a
record after full-year profit increased 29 percent, led by
improved sales in  Europe .  The stock advanced 5.3 percent to 31.83 rand at the close
of trading in Johannesburg, the highest price since at least
1998, valuing the company at 58.4 billion rand ($5.8 billion).
The stock has advanced  16 percent  this year, compared with an  11
percent (JALSH)  gain in the 165-member FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index.  Net income for the 12 months ended in June rose to 7.3
billion rand from 5.66 billion rand a year earlier, the company
said in a statement today. Sales advanced 44 percent to 115.48
billion rand.  “Our continued investments in our European store network
have delivered further benefits with market share gains and
margin improvement reported in many of the countries where we
operate,” Chief Executive Officer Markus Jooste said in an e-mailed statement.  Steinhoff, which has 59 percent of its sales outside
southern  Africa , is boosting growth through acquisitions in
Europe. The company said on June 26 it had concluded agreements
to acquire Austria’s Kika and Leiner, without disclosing the
value of the transaction.  The deal “completes out footprint in central and old
Europe,” Jooste said in a phone interview from Johannesburg.
“It was something we worked on for nearly three years. It’s a
purely cash transaction.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
