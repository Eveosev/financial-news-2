The U.S. Energy Information
Administration raised its 2013 forecast for gasoline consumption
by 0.1 percent from last month’s estimate to 8.7 million barrels
a day.  Gasoline  demand  in 2014 may be 8.66 million barrels a day,
down from last month’s forecast of 8.67 million, the statistical
arm of the Energy Department said today in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The agency increased the outlook for regular-grade  gasoline 
in 2013 by 4 cents to $3.56 a gallon. Prices in the fourth
quarter will average $3.44 a gallon.  “EIA expects gasoline prices to slowly fall from their
recent highs as crude oil prices begin to decline, the summer
driving season comes to a close, and gasoline prices are
forecast to average $3.44 per gallon during the fourth quarter
from their summer peak of $3.68 in late July,” EIA
Administrator Adam Sieminski said in an e-mailed statement.  The average price in 2014 may be $3.43 a gallon, 6 cents
above the August estimate of $3.37. Prices in 2012 averaged
$3.63 a gallon.  Distillate demand, including diesel and heating oil, will
be 3.86 million barrels a day this year, unchanged from last
month’s outlook. The estimate for 2014 consumption was increased
to 3.91 million barrels a day from the previous forecast of 3.88
million.  On-road diesel will average $3.96 a gallon this year, up
from last month’s forecast of $3.92. Next year, prices may drop
to $3.82 a gallon, compared with last month’s estimate of $3.76.  To contact the reporter on this story:
