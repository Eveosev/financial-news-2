Exports of Azeri Light crude from
Georgiaâ€™s Black Sea port of Supsa in October will decline to
four cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, one less than in
September, a loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  BP Plc (BP/)  operates the Baku-Supsa pipeline, which carries
Azeri Light from the  Caspian Sea  to the Black Sea.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
