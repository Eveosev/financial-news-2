Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  retreated from a one-week high as Chinese  steel mills 
increased production of the building material.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined as much as 0.5 percent to 3,735  yuan  ($610) a
metric ton before trading at 3,736 yuan at 10:43 a.m. local
time. The contract closed at 3,752 yuan yesterday, the highest
level since Sept. 2.  Daily crude steel output in China, the world’s biggest
producer, reached 2.1 million tons in August, compared with 1.9
million tons at the end of 2012, according to the China Iron and
Steel Association.  “Steel mills may continue to ramp up production because
their profit margins have improved lately,” said Wang
Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  The average spot price of rebar fell for a third day
yesterday, losing 0.4 percent to 3,580 yuan a ton, according to
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose for
the first time in four days, adding 0.5 percent to $134.80 a dry
ton yesterday, according to a  price index  compiled by The Steel
Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
