Russia ’s offer to prod Syria to
relinquish its chemical-weapons stockpile may provide a way to
avert a punitive strike on the regime in Damascus, French
Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said.  France , which would take part in a U.S.-led bombardment of
Syria, “welcomes the Russian proposal with interest and
prudence,” Fabius said today on Europe 1 radio. “Interest
because it’s the first time there is an opening and prudence
because it could be long and complicated to put in place.”  With President  Barack Obama  set to make his case in a
speech tonight at 9 p.m. in Washington, the diplomatic twist
came after Russia embraced U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s
comment that strikes could be averted if  Syria  hands “every
single bit” of its chemical weapons to international control.  “Our firmness has paid off because the Russians have
realized that our proof of the chemical massacre is damning,”
Fabius said. “They have evolved.” Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad denies using chemical weapons.  Fabius said any agreement would require the imposition of
sanctions were Assad to breach any commitment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
