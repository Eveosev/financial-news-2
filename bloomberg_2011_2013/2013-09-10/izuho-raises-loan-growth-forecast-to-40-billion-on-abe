Mizuho (8411)  Financial Group Inc. raised
its domestic loan growth forecast to 4 trillion yen ($40
billion) over three years as the  Tokyo  Olympics and Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies spur large companies to borrow.  Mizuho, which in February estimated as much as 3 trillion
yen in loan growth by March 2016, added about 1 trillion yen to
the forecast,  Japan ’s third-biggest bank by market value said in
materials presented at an investor conference in Tokyo today.  It’s the first time that Mizuho has measured the benefit
from so-called Abenomics on lending, which has begun to pick up
after years of deflation, a shrinking population and economic
stagnation hampered credit demand. About 70 percent of the
bank’s clients are large public companies and the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government is also a customer.  “Mizuho can benefit from the fact that it has the biggest
portion of large corporates in its client base among the three
megabanks,” said Yoshinobu Yamada, a Tokyo-based analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG. “I expect they will easily achieve the
lending target as Abenomics kicks in.”  Mizuho Chief Executive Officer  Yasuhiro Sato  spoke to
Japanese and foreign institutional investors in Tokyo today.
More than 1,500 equity investors, including 320 from the U.S.,
Asia and Europe, registered or the four-day event.  The Tokyo-based bank had 53.7 trillion yen in outstanding
domestic loans as of March 31 and 54.6 trillion yen as of June
30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
