FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , South Africa’s
second-biggest financial-services company, said fiscal full-year
profit climbed 20 percent as it lured more customers.  Normalized income, which takes into account asset sales a
year earlier, rose to 15.3 billion rand ($1.54 billion) in the
12 months through June, from 12.7 billion rand a year earlier,
the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today.
Earnings per share excluding one-time items increased 20 percent
to 2.72 rand, in line with the median estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  While FirstRand has failed in its goal to buy assets in
Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia, its consumer unit has attracted more
customers in South Africa and expanded in  India . Rand Merchant
Bank, the company’s investment banking unit, started operations
in Nigeria in December.  The consumer banking unit increased profit through
“customer acquisition, loan and deposit growth,” FirstRand
said in the statement. The vehicle-finance unit “continued to
grow new business volumes across all portfolios, and Rand
Merchant Bank’s diversified investment banking and corporate
portfolios delivered strong growth.”  FirstRand closed up 3.2 percent to 32.30 rand in
Johannesburg and has gained 4.2 percent this year, outperforming
Standard Bank Group Ltd. and  Barclays Africa Group Ltd. (BGA) , which
have declined 4.7 percent and 14.7 percent respectively.  FirstRand boosted its dividend 33 percent to 1.36 rand a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
