The Canadian and Ontario
governments agreed to sell 30 million  General Motors Co. (GM)  shares
worth about $1.1 billion to  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Royal Bank
of Canada (RY)  in a block trade.  With the sale, the two governments reduced their stake in
the largest U.S. automaker by 21 percent to 110 million shares,
according to a statement today. Canada and Ontario were the
third-largest shareholders in Detroit-based GM after they helped
bail out the carmaker.  “As we said from the start, our investment in GM was
always meant to be temporary as we worked to maximize the return
to Canadian taxpayers,” Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said in a
statement. “The government of Canada is committed to exiting
from ownership of GM as quickly as feasible, while maximizing
the return for Canadian taxpayers, as we demonstrated today.”  The sale will be completed Sept. 16, the department of
finance said in the statement. The shares were sold to the banks
at today’s closing price, minus a discount, the government said.  Before today’s sale, the federal and Ontario governments
together held 140 million common shares in GM, or a 10 percent
stake, valued at $5.1 billion at the current stock price,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  GM rose 1.4 percent to $37 in  New York  trading today. The
stock has gained 28 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
