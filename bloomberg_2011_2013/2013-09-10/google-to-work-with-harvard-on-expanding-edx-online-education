Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
largest search engine, is joining the EdX online venture with
Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
to allow teachers to create new education software.  Google will develop Open EdX, which will enable educators
to innovate and experiment with the existing teaching
technology, which delivers advanced courses to any student
around the world with access to the Internet, EdX said today in
a statement.  Stanford University, the University of California,
Berkeley,  Tsinghua University  near Beijing, and other members of
the non-profit EdX network will collaborate with Google on the
effort to create the open-source learning platform, EdX said.
Google will also help the venture create a site, called
MOOC.org, that will allow institutions outside the network to
develop their own courses, according to the statement.  “We have long admired Google’s commitment to open access
to information, and we believe they will be a perfect partner to
work with as we shape the next generation of open education and
learning,” EdX president Anant Agarwal said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
