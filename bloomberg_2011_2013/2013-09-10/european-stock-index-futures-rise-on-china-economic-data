European stocks  rose to their
highest level in 3 1/2 months as Chinese economic data beat
estimates and the U.S. offered to defer an attack on Syria if it
complied with a Russian proposal to give up chemical weapons.  PSA  Peugeot (UG)  Citroen climbed to a 17-month high after saying
it won’t cut prices for the Peugeot brand. Glencore Xstrata Plc
advanced 2.3 percent after raising its estimate for financial
gains from its merger with Xstrata Plc. Neste Oil Oyj surged to
a five-year high after upgrading its full-year forecast.
GlaxoSmithKline Plc slid 2.5 percent as new U.S. guidelines
opened the door for generic versions of its Advair drug.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rallied 1.3 percent to 309.8 at
the close of trading in  London , its highest level since May 22.
The gauge has surged 11 percent this year as central banks
around the world maintained stimulus measures and the global
economy showed signs of recovery.  “There is a change in sentiment and we think markets can
go further until the end of the year,” Herbert Perus, who helps
oversee about $36 billion as head of equities at Raiffeisen
Capital Management in Vienna, said by telephone. “ Syria  is not
as big a problem anymore. The possibility of a military strike
seems low now.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 33 percent higher than the 30-day average,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Chinese Economy  China ’s  industrial output  rose 10.4 percent in August from
a year earlier and retail sales gained 13.4 percent, the
National Bureau of Statistics said today. The advance in
industrial production compared with a median estimate for 9.9
percent growth in a Bloomberg News survey and a 9.7 percent
increase in July. The retail-sales figure compared with a
projection for 13.3 percent advance and a 13.2 percent gain the
previous month.  “International investors are getting more and more aware
of the fact that European markets are not as bad as they looked
in the past,” Perus said. “The fear over China was overstated.
These are normalized figures and this is good for the markets
because that fear is getting priced out.”  National benchmarks rose in 17 of the 18 western European
markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 gained 1.9 percent.  Germany ’s  DAX (DAX) 
rallied 2.1 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 0.8 percent.  Avoiding Attacks  U.S. President  Barack Obama  said on ABC News that an
assault on Syria will “absolutely” be put on hold if it agrees
to surrender chemical weapons. Interfax reported that Bashar al-Assad’s government accepted a Russian-backed plan to establish
international control over such arms following an attack last
month that killed hundreds of people in the suburbs of Damascus.  Obama will address Americans on television at 9 p.m.
Washington time.  Peugeot gained 1.8 percent to 12.33 euros, its highest
since March 2012. Maxime Picat, managing director of the Peugeot
brand, said at  the Frankfurt auto show  the carmaker will not cut
prices even as it faces price pressure in Europe. Separately, a
report from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers
showed auto sales to dealerships in the world’s second-biggest
economy rose 11 percent last month from a year ago.  A gauge of automobile and car-part companies posted the
biggest gain among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600,
increasing 2.5 percent. Volkswagen AG preferred shares climbed
4.1 percent to 178.05 euros.  Glencore Gains  Glencore Xstrata (GLEN)  advanced 2.3 percent to 328.75 pence, its
highest price since May 30. The world’s biggest exporter of
power-station coal said in a statement that “synergies” from
its merger with Xstrata will be at least $2 billion, exceeding
the initial guidance of $500 million. The Baar, Switzerland-based company released the statement before its investor meeting
in London today.  Neste Oil surged 13 percent to 17.33 euros. Finland’s only
refiner said comparable operating profit will increase to more
than 530 million euros ($702 million) in 2013. Earlier, the
company had merely said profit will be an improvement over last
year’s 355 million euros.  Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM)  jumped 5.3 percent to 382.2 pence. The
U.K. fund manager that invests in  emerging markets  reported
full-year pretax profit and revenue that exceeded estimates. The
London-based company also raised its dividend.  Glaxo fell 2.5 percent to 1,598.5 pence. Draft guidelines
published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration yesterday
call for “relatively basic preclinical tests and a very short
clinical trial,” for generic replacements to drugs such as
Advair, Bloomberg Industries analyst Sam Fazeli wrote in a note
today. “Advair sales will probably suffer an accelerated fall
in 2016.”  Eiffage SA lost 5.7 percent to 41.20 euros. Groupama SA
sold shares of the company that manages toll roads and other
infrastructure at 41.75 euros apiece, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the transaction.  Partners Group Holding AG tumbled 8.7 percent to 226.40
Swiss francs for the biggest drop since October 2008. The Swiss
 money manager  focused on private equity reported performance
fees slid 35 percent to 13 million Swiss francs ($13.9 million),
depressing the firm’s margin on revenue to 127 basis points,
from 137 basis points a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
