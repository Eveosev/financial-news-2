The benchmark index for  Chinese
stocks (HSCEI)  listed in Hong Kong rose 20 percent from this year’s low
after valuations fell to the cheapest levels since 2008 and data
signaled economic growth is accelerating.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of so-called H shares
climbed 1.2 percent to 10,653.69 as of 9:38 a.m. in Hong Kong,
poised to enter a bull market after advancing 20 percent from
its June 25 low.  China Oilfield Services Ltd. (2883)  led gains.  Premier  Li Keqiang  has said he’s confident China will
achieve its economic targets for this year. Banks from JPMorgan
Chase & Co. to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded growth
projections this month on stronger manufacturing data. The H-share gauge slumped 27 percent from Feb. 1 through June 25,
dragging its  price-earnings ratio  to the lowest since the
financial crisis in 2008, as  China’s economy  slowed for two
straight quarters and policy makers spurred a credit crunch to
curb speculative lending.  “What’s changed since the end of June is that perceptions
of Chinese growth have improved,” said Stephen Corry, a Hong
Kong-based chief investment strategist at LGT Group, which
oversees about $115 billion. “The expectations for economic
growth in  China  were extremely depressed.”  Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan boosted their 2013 economic
growth forecasts for the nation to 7.6 percent from 7.4 percent
after an official manufacturing gauge climbed last month to a
16-month high. Exports increased more than estimated in August
while consumer prices rose 2.6 percent, staying below a
government target and leaving room for extra stimulus if needed.  The last time the  H-share gauge  entered a bull market was
in September last year, when positive Chinese data helped end a
slide in shares. Bull markets for the measure last an average
185 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on the
24 occurrences since 1993. The longest in the past decade began
in May 2004, which lasted for two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
