Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc., the exchange
owner that also develops trading software used by other markets,
licensed its Genium Inet system to Boerse Stuttgart AG.  The German venue for  products  such as securitized
derivatives, corporate bonds and stocks plans to start using the
platform in 2015, Nasdaq said in a statement.  Nasdaq will work “to support Boerse Stuttgart’s focus of
bringing private investors to the same level as institutional
investors,” Lars Ottersgard, senior vice president of market
technology at Nasdaq, said in the statement.  The announcement comes as the exchanges worldwide grapple
with technology malfunctions. Nasdaq shut its U.S. markets on
Aug. 22 after a flood of data exposed a flaw in its system for
disseminating prices. Everbright Securities Co.’s Aug. 16 error
prompted the biggest swings in Chinese equities since 2009.  Nasdaq, the second-largest operator of U.S. stock exchanges
and the owner of seven Nordic and Baltic markets, has
diversified into other businesses, providing technology to more
than 70 exchanges, clearinghouses and central securities
depositories. That unit generated $95 million of second-quarter
sales, or 21 percent of Nasdaq’s net revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
