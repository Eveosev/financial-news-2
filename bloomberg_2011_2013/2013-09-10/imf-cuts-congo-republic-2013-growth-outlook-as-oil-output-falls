The  International Monetary Fund 
trimmed its 2013 economic growth forecast for the Republic of
Congo because of falling oil production.  Gross domestic product is expected to rise 5.8 percent,
half a percentage point lower than a prior forecast, the
Washington-based lender said today in a statement on its
website. The economy expanded 3.8 percent last year, it said.  “Preliminary data points to somewhat weaker economic
activity, particularly in the oil sector,” it said.  Congo Republic, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s fourth-largest oil
producer last year, relies on crude to generate 65 percent of
GDP and its proven oil reserves are estimated at 2 billion
barrels, according to the IMF. The country also produces
diamonds and gold, and has deposits of  iron ore , copper, zinc
and potash, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  Oil production is projected to drop for at least the third
consecutive year to 96 million barrels in 2013 from 115 million
barrels in 2010, according to data compiled by the IMF.  The economy may grow at a 6.5 percent average pace between
2014 and 2016 as the country switches crude production from
maturing deposits to new fields, leading to unstable levels of
output, the IMF said. Inflation will slow to 4.1 percent by the
end of the year, from 7.5 percent in 2012, it said.  “The medium-term prospects are generally favorable,” the
IMF said. “The main risks to the outlook are related to
possible downward pressures on  oil prices , stemming from
uncertainties in the euro area and  emerging markets .” The
prospects also depend on a presidential election in 2016 going
smoothly, it said.  Economic gains haven’t filtered down to the poor with the
country’s poverty rate of 46.5 percent in 2011 “much higher”
than other peer oil-exporting countries, the IMF said.  “Congo ought to make growth more inclusive while
preserving macroeconomic stability,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
