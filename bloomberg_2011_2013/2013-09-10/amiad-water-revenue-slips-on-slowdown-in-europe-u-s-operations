Amiad Water Systems Ltd. (AFS) , an
Israel-based water-treatment company, said revenue fell almost 7
percent to $61.7 million in the first half due to European and
U.S. municipal and industrial market conditions.  A delay in the implementation of International Maritime
Organization regulations for ballast water in ships that will
come into force in 2014 affected the results as well, the water-filtration producer that trades in London said today in a
statement.  The shares fell the most in a year, 3.8 percent to 314
pence in London, a 6-month low.  Amiad said it’s well-positioned to benefit from the growth
opportunity in the ballast market when conditions improve as
it’s “expected that around 60,000 ships worldwide will need
refitting with one or more cleansing units by 2020, resulting in
a filtration market worth approximately $1 billion.”  Irrigation sales were flat compared with a year earlier
while oil and gas operation revenues almost doubled to $3
million from a year ago, Amiad said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
