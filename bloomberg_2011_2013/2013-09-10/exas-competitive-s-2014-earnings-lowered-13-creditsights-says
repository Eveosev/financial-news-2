The deregulated unit of Energy
Future Holdings Corp. will earn $1.74 billion next year, 13
percent lower than the previous estimate, according to
CreditSights Inc.  The New York-based debt-research firm reduced Texas
Competitive Electric Holdings Co.’s projected  earnings  before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization from a previous
forecast of $2 billion based on “weak summer power prices,”
CreditSights analysts  Andy DeVries  and  Charles Johnston  wrote in
a report today.  The analysts see a restructuring at the unit that owns
Luminant and TXU Energy before a coupon payment is due Nov. 1.
Assuming two years in bankruptcy and Ebitda moving back to $2
billion in 2015 or 2016, Texas Competitive’s first-lien
creditors will recover 73 cents on the dollar, up from an
estimate of 65 cents, “based on higher gas prices and cash flow
retention in bankruptcy,” they wrote.  Texas’ largest electricity provider, formerly known as TXU
Corp., has struggled to cut debt since it was taken over in a
$48 billion deal in 2007 led by KKR & Co., TPG Capital and
Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, leaving it with more than $40
billion of obligations in a gamble natural gas prices would
rise.  Instead, prices plunged more than 70 percent from a July
2008 high. The company said in April that creditors had rejected
a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan to restructure $32 billion in
bonds and loans held by its competitive power unit.  Allan Koenig , a spokesman for Dallas-based Energy Future,
declined to comment on the report.  Additional Discussions  Texas Competitive’s $1.8 billion of 10.25 percent bonds due
November 2015 traded at 3.75 cents on the dollar Sept. 9, up
from an all-time low of 3.69 cents on Sept. 6, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  The company’s $15.4 billion  term loan  that expires in
October 2017 traded at 68.7 cents today, up from 67.6 cents on
Sept. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Energy Future said last month it has “engaged in
additional discussions” with a broader group of creditors and
continues to evaluate restructuring options including filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy for some or all of the company, excluding
power-line unit Oncor Electric Delivery Co.  Holders of Energy Future’s debt may get less of their money
back than comparable restructurings when the power company that
was the target of the biggest leveraged buyout in history files
for bankruptcy this year, according to Moody’s Investors
Service. Investors across the company will recover about 50
percent when it files in the fourth quarter, Moody’s analysts
led by Jim Hempstead wrote in a note yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
