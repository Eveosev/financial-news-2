Mexico ’s peso held at a two-week
high amid eased concern that the the U.S. Federal Reserve this
month will pare monetary stimulus that has boosted demand for
riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso was little changed at 13.1084 at 10:07 a.m. in
Mexico City after closing yesterday at the highest since Aug.
23. Yields on peso bonds maturing in 2024 fell two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, today to 6.31 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s peso has gained after data on Sept. 6 showed the
 U.S. economy  added fewer jobs than forecast in August, damping
speculation that the Fed will begin scaling back its $85 billion
monthly bond purchase program, referred to as QE, in September.
A bid by Russia to get Syria to surrender its chemical weapons
is also helping bolster the peso, according to Pedro Tuesta, a
senior economist at 4cast Ltd.  “All those elements that were increasing  risk aversion  are
kind of diminishing or disappearing,” Tuesta said in a
telephone interview from  Washington . “The bets on the QE
tapering have been reduced. People are starting to think if they
do it, it’s going to be very small and they may even delay it to
October.”  Peso bonds have also been rallying since Mexico’s central
bank reduced the country’s target lending rate by 0.25
percentage point Sept. 6 to a record 3.75 percent, surprising
all but one of the 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
