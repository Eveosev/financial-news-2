The ruble gained for a fifth day as
Chinese economic data improved and a Russian proposal for  Syria 
to surrender its chemical weapons eased concern over a U.S.
strike, boosting investor appetite for riskier assets.  The currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter
advanced 0.3 percent against Bank Rossii’s target basket of
dollars and euros to 37.8848, the highest level since Aug. 19.
It strengthened 0.3 percent against the dollar to 33.0690 by
3:49 p.m. in Moscow. The yield on government bonds due February
2027 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.92
percent.  China ’s industrial output increased 10.4 percent in August
from a year earlier and retail sales gained 13.4 percent, the
National Bureau of Statistics said today. France said it will
submit a Russian-backed plan to confiscate Syria’s chemical
weapons to the United Nations, as Interfax reported that Bashar
al-Assad’s government accepted the proposal.  “Good numbers from China and on top of that the market
liked”  Russia ’s Syria plan, trading desk strategist at  Danske
Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Helsinki, said in e-mailed comments. “Full risk-on
today.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  Emerging Markets  Currencies Index
rose 0.2 percent to 89.21, a three-week high. Brent oil slid 1.4
percent to $112.16 per barrel.  The central bank moved toward a free-floating ruble
exchange rate yesterday by lowering the amount of accumulated
interventions required to shift the currency’s trading band.  “This decision removes the risk for band widening in the
near future” and is positive for the ruble, VTB Capital
analysts Maxim Korovin and Anton Nikitin said in an e-mailed
note. They recommended betting the ruble will strengthen to
37.50 against the basket.  To contact the reporter on this story:
