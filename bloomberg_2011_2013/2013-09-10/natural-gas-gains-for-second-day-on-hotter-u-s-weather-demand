Natural gas futures slid for the
third time in four days in New York on speculation that
government data will show a larger-than-normal increase in
stockpiles of the power-plant fuel.  Gas declined 0.6 percent. An Energy Information
Administration report scheduled for release Sept. 12 may show
inventories grew by 65 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Sept. 6, according to the median of six analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain for the week
is 62 billion.  “The storage injection possibly coming in above average is
putting pressure on the market,” said Phil Flynn, a senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “We had a
little bit of a drop in demand last week and inventories are
starting to catch up.”  Natural gas for October delivery fell 2.1 cents to settle
at $3.584 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 24 percent below the
100-day average at 2:50 p.m. Prices are up 7 percent this year.  The discount of October to November futures was unchanged
at 7.6 cents. October gas traded 32.2 cents below the January
contract, compared with 31.6 cents yesterday.  Options Trading  February $4.60 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.4 cent lower at 7.5 cents per
million Btu on volume of 720 at 2:59 p.m. Calls accounted for 62
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for October at-the-money options was 29.83 percent at 2:45 p.m., compared with
29.28 percent yesterday.  Gas inventories totaled 3.188 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Aug. 30, 1.4 percent above the five-year average and
6.2 percent below last year’s supplies, EIA data show.  Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland ,
predicted temperatures would be mostly normal on the East Coast
from Sept. 15 through Sept. 24.  The high in New York on Sept. 22 may be 73 degrees
Fahrenheit (23 Celsius), matching the normal reading, said
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,  Pennsylvania . Power
generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas demand, according
to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Natural gas production may rise 1.1 percent this year to
69.91 billion cubic feet a day, the EIA said today in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The agency increased its forecast from
69.89 billion last month.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first five months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, according to the EIA.  Tropical Systems  Tropical Storm Gabrielle was approaching  Bermuda  with
maximum sustained winds near 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour,
the National Hurricane Center in Miami said in a 1:30 p.m.
 outlook.  An area of showers and thunderstorms in the
northwestern Caribbean Sea is moving toward the Bay of Campeche
and has a 70 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in
the next five days.  The Gulf will account for 5.7 percent of U.S. gas
production this year, EIA data show. Today is the statistical
peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, according to the
hurricane center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
