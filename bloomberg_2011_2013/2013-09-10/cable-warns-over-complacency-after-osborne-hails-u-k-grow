Business Secretary Vince Cable
today will warn against complacency concerning the U.K. economy,
saying that credit for signs of recovery should go to business,
which continues to need more funding.  Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
said in a speech on Sept. 9 that the economy had “turned a
corner,” and that his decision to press on with spending cuts
has been vindicated. In a speech of his own, Cable will say
there is a danger of “complacency, generated by a few quarters
of good economic data.”  Cable will tell business leaders in Warwick,  England , that
while he sees “evidence of confidence returning,” this is
thanks to “pragmatic British businesses and flexible British
workers who kick-started the recovery,” according to his
office.  The Business Secretary, a Liberal Democrat member of
Britain’s coalition government, will also make a case for a
government-sponsored industrial strategy, and signal readiness
to work with the opposition  Labour Party  after the 2015 election
by saying his plans have “sufficient support across the
business world and across party lines to maintain a long-term
focus.”  Chuka Umunna, Labour’s business spokesman, in an e-mailed
statement described Cable’s words as “an embarrassing slapdown
to George Osborne’s deeply complacent and out of touch speech
this week.”  Cable will repeat his warning that banks aren’t lending
enough to small companies, something he will say continues to
threaten the recovery. He will speak at about 10 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
