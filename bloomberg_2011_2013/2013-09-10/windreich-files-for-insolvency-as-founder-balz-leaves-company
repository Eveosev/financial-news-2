Windreich GmbH, a German company
developing a 400-megawatt wind farm in the  North Sea , filed for
insolvency and replaced its founder and Chief Executive Officer
Willi Balz.  Windreich made its application at the Esslingen court at
the end of last week, the Wolfschlugen-based company said in a
 letter  to bond investors yesterday.  Werner Heer, a former company consultant, succeeds Balz and
will develop a restructuring plan to be presented to creditors
and investors in the coming weeks, Windreich said. Heer will
focus on developing the  MEG I  offshore project that’s “shortly
before the finalization of financing,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
