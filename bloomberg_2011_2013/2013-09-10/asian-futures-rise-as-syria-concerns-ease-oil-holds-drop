U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a seventh straight gain, after
President  Barack Obama  asked Congress to delay a vote
authorizing a military strike against  Syria . Treasuries rallied
as a $21 billion auction drew the highest demand in six months.  The S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent to an almost one-month high of
1,689.13 at 4 p.m. in  New York , with a plunge in Apple Inc.
shares limiting its gain, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
jumped to a five-year high. Treasury 10-year yields slid six
basis points to 2.91 percent while the dollar was weaker versus
the euro and yen. The British pound jumped 0.6 percent to
$1.5824 as a report showed unemployment decreased. Oil rose 17
cents to $107.56 a barrel as stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
decreased to the lowest level since February 2012.  Obama asked Congress to delay a vote on Syria while the
administration pursues a proposal that would have the nation
surrender its chemical arms, he said last night in a speech in
 Washington . The U.K’s unemployment rate measured by
International Labour Organization methods declined to 7.7
percent from 7.8 percent in the second quarter, the  Office for
National Statistics  said. The  Federal Reserve ’s policy committee
meets next week to decide whether to reduce its monthly bond
purchases.  “We’re not out of the woods on news from Syria yet, but
for the time being the market has digested the decision to delay
action,” Russell Croft, who helps manage $900 million as a
Croft-Leominster Inc. fund manager in Baltimore, said by phone.
“Right now all eyes are on next week’s Fed meeting, that’ll be
the big driver in the market with a few datapoints between now
and then.”  September Rally  The  S&P 500  has advanced 3.4 percent so far in September as
reports showed  China’s economy  has strengthened and concern
abated that the U.S. will soon bomb Syria.  International Business Machines Corp. surged 2.2 percent
after agreeing to sell its customer-care outsourcing business to
Synnex Corp. for $505 million. Marriott International Inc.
increased 3.2 percent after a Chinese land developer said he
wants to buy hotel-management companies in the U.S. Apple
plunged 5.4 percent, extending its two-day slump to 7.6 percent,
as the price of its new lower-cost iPhone disappointed analysts.  Economists estimate the Fed this month will taper its
monthly bond buying by $10 billion, to $75 billion, according to
the median of 34 responses in a Bloomberg News survey. The
stimulus has helped the  S&P 500 (SPX)  rally as much as 153 percent
since the beginning of the  bull market  in March 2009 through its
last record on Aug. 2.  Moving Average  The S&P 500 traded yesterday above its 150-day  moving
average  for the 200th straight session. That’s the sixth longest
streak since 1980 and the longest since 2004, according to
Miller Tabak & Co.’s Jonathan Krinsky. In five prior instances,
after crossing the 200-day mark, further gains were “rather
limited” during four runs, while in the 1995-1996 streak, the
S&P 500 rose another 15 percent, Krinsky wrote.  Speculation about the stimulus has  whipsawed stocks  since
May, when Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first indicated cuts could
start this year. The S&P 500 tumbled 5.8 percent from a record
high on May 21 through June 24. It rebounded 8.7 percent to
close at its latest all-time high of 1,709.67 on Aug. 2. The
gauge then slumped as much as 4.6 percent before the current
rally brought it back to within 1.3 percent of the record and
above the May 21 peak.  Stanley Druckenmiller , who boasts one of the hedge-fund
industry’s best long-term track records of the past three
decades, said ending the bond buying over the next year will
roil markets.  “I really don’t care whether we go to $70 billion or $65
billion in September,” Druckenmiller said today in an interview
with Bloomberg Television. “But if you tell me quantitative
easing is going to be removed over nine or 12 months, that is a
big deal.”  Treasury Auction  Treasuries advanced after demand at the U.S. auction of $21
billion in 10-year notes increased to the highest level since
March. The securities yielded 2.946 percent, trailing a forecast
of 2.964 percent in a Bloomberg News poll of eight of the Fed’s
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount sold, was 2.86, versus 2.45
at the last sale and an average of 2.73 at the past 10.  Treasuries briefly erased gains before the auction as
traders bet the sale of a record $49 billion in corporate bonds
by  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  would lead to the unwinding of
hedges used to guard against higher yields. Verizon, the second-biggest U.S. telephone carrier, sold the offering in eight
parts. The transaction tripled the size of Apple’s record $17
billion issue in April.  European Markets  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.3 percent as utilities
and automobile companies led gains. Trading volume was 23
percent greater than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) , which designs chips for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhones, rallied the most in four months after the U.S. company
unveiled two new models of the device. EON SE and RWE AG surged
more than 4 percent, leading a gauge of utilities higher.
Kingfisher Plc retreated 2.7 percent after first-half pretax
profit missed analysts’ estimates.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rose for a sixth day,
climbing 0.2 percent and reaching a three-month high. The
Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent while the Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in  Hong
Kong  decreased 0.6 percent.  China Speech  The foundations of a rebound aren’t yet solid and China is
taking steps to stabilize growth and can achieve the main
economic targets this year, Premier  Li Keqiang  said in a speech
today at the  World Economic Forum  in Dalian, China.  India’s rupee strengthened 0.8 percent versus the dollar
and Russia’s ruble added 0.6 percent. The euro rose 0.3 percent
to $1.3311, climbing for a fourth day. The yen appreciated 0.5
percent to 99.86 per dollar.  Italy’s 10-year bond yields were above those of Spain for a
second day, after rates surpassed those on the Iberian
securities yesterday for the first time in 18 months amid
speculation a vote on whether to expel  Silvio Berlusconi  from
Italy’s Senate will destabilize the coalition government.  The  Italian yield  fell less than one basis point to 4.53
percent. Spain’s decreased three basis points to 4.49 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
