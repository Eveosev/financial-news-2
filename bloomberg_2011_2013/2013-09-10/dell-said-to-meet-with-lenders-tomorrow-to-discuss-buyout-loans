Dell Inc. (DELL)  is meeting with lenders
tomorrow to discuss $5.5 billion in loans to back its buyout by
Silver Lake Management LLC and Chief Executive Officer  Michael
Dell , according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The financing consists of a $4 billion term B portion and a
$1.5 billion C slice, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because of lack of authorization to speak publicly.
The personal computer maker may start selling junk bonds as
early next week to fund the purchase.  The loans are part of $13.8 billion financing commitment
Dell obtained in February to back the $24.9 billion deal, the
biggest leveraged buyout since Energy Future Holdings Corp. was
purchased by KKR & Co. and Texas Pacific Group in 2007.
Billionaire financier  Carl Icahn  gave up battling for control of
Dell yesterday, ending months of opposition that impeded the
buyout from being completed.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group
AG, and Royal Bank of Canada are arranging the financing, which
also includes a $2 billion asset-backed piece and $3.25 billion
of bridge debt, Bloomberg data show.  Bridge facilities are short-term loans that usually mature
in one year and are often used as backstops to bond offerings or
longer-dated bank debt.  Dell and partner Silver Lake sweetened their proposal last
month by offering a special dividend of 13 cents a share on top
of an already increased bid of $13.75 a share.  The lender meeting was earlier reported by Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
