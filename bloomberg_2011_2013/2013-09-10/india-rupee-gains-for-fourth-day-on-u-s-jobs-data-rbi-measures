India ’s rupee rose 6.1 percent in
the past four days, the biggest gain since at least 1973, as
U.S. jobs data that fell short of estimates tempered concern the
 Federal Reserve  will cut stimulus this month.  Non-farm payrolls in the U.S. climbed 169,000 in August,
official data showed Sept. 6, trailing the 180,000 median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Indian markets were shut
yesterday for a local holiday. The  Reserve Bank  of India last
week announced a plan to provide concessional swaps for banks’
foreign-currency deposits to boost the supply of dollars.  The rupee gained 2.2 percent from Sept. 6 to 63.84 per
dollar in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. It strengthened past 64 for the first time since
Aug. 26 to as high as 63.765. The currency, which touched an
all-time low of 68.845 on Aug. 28, advanced 6.1 percent in the
four trading days through today, the biggest gain in data
compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1973.  “The rupee’s move is due to the positive sentiment
generated after the payrolls data and the measures taken by the
RBI,” said Ashtosh Raina, head of foreign-exchange trading at
 HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB)  in Mumbai. The currency could strengthen to
around 63 per dollar before resuming its drop because of India’s
weak economic fundamentals, he said.  The S&P BSE Sensex rose 3.8 percent to 19,997.10 today, the
biggest gain since May 2009. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
government bond fell 16 basis points to 8.47 percent.  Trade Deficit  India’s trade deficit narrowed to $10.9 billion in August
from $14.2 billion a year ago, a government report showed today.
Total imports fell 0.7 percent to $37.1 billion even as oil
shipments surged 18 percent to $15.1 billion. Exports rose 13
percent.  China ’s exports rose 7.2 percent last month from a year
earlier, the General Administration of Customs said Sept. 8.
That exceeded the 5.5 percent median estimate of analysts.  Global funds have cut  holdings  of Indian debt by $10.2
billion since May 22, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first
flagged a potential paring of stimulus, leaving the rupee
vulnerable to the nation’s current-account deficit. The
shortfall in the broadest measure of trade widened to a record
4.8 percent of gross domestic product in the year ended March 31
as growth eased to 5 percent, the slowest pace in a decade.  “An environment of better global growth and weak domestic
demand should correct the current-account deficit this fiscal
year,”  Sonal Varma , an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in
Mumbai, wrote in a research report today. “We expect financing
of the deficit to remain difficult.”  Meeting Delayed  The Fed has said the jobs market needs to show signs of
improvement to warrant any trimming of asset purchases as policy
makers prepare to meet Sept. 17-18 to review the plan.  Raghuram
Rajan , who took charge as RBI governor on Sept. 4, announced the
same day that he has postponed the Indian central bank’s meeting
to Sept. 20 from Sept. 18 to give him “enough time to consider
all major developments in the required detail.”  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
199 basis points, or 1.99 percentage point, to 18.03 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 1.8 percent from
Sept. 6 to 65.59 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Offshore non-deliverable contracts climbed 1.1 percent to 65.95.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
