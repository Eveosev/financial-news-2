Canadian employers’ hiring plans
held at the lowest level in three years on reduced optimism in
the mining and education industries, according to a survey by
 Manpower Inc. (MAN)   The share of companies planning to hire in the fourth
quarter exceeded those forecasting cutbacks by 10 percentage
points after adjusting for seasonal variations, unchanged from
the prior survey by the Milwaukee-based job-services firm.  Canada is headed for the slowest advance in  employment 
since 2001 outside of the last recession based on federal
statistics through August. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty
yesterday froze employment insurance premiums for three years in
a bid to encourage new hiring.  “A mild national hiring climate is projected in the coming
quarter,” Byrne Luft, vice president of operations for Manpower
Canada, said in a statement from Toronto. “We’re seeing a trend
of more companies hiring workers on a temporary or contract
basis with relatively few choosing to hire full-time.”  The net hiring outlook for education fell to 4 percent from
8 percent in the Manpower poll, and mining dropped to 7 percent
to 12 percent, the lowest since the third quarter of 2009.
Construction was the most optimistic with an outlook of 21
percent, the highest since the first quarter of 2008.  The survey of more than 1,900 Canadian employers has a
margin of error of 2.2 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
