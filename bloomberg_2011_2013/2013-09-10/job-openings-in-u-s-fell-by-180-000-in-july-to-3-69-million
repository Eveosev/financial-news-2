Job openings  in the U.S. fell in
July to the lowest level in six months, signaling uneven
progress in employment.  The number of  positions  waiting to be filled declined by
180,000 to 3.69 million, from a revised 3.87 million the prior
month that was weaker than initially reported, the Labor
Department said today in  Washington . Hiring rose and firings
cooled.  The report, following data last week showing payrolls grew
less than forecast in August, indicates the labor market was
struggling to gain momentum at the start of the third quarter.
Federal Reserve officials, due to meet Sept. 17-18, are debating
whether the economy and job market have improved enough to
warrant trimming $85 billion in monthly bond purchases.  “The labor market is still recovering, though slowly,”
 Russell Price , a senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc.
in  Detroit , said before the report. “We’re going to see
businesses become a little more cautious.”  Today’s report helps shed light on the dynamics behind the
monthly employment figures.  Payrolls expanded by 169,000 workers last month after
rising 104,000 in July, Labor Department data showed on Sept. 6.
The jobless rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August, the lowest
since December 2008, as workers left the  labor force .  Today’s Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTs,
report showed the number of people hired climbed to 4.42 million
in July, keeping the  hiring rate  at 3.2 percent.  Industry Openings  Job openings decreased at construction companies,
retailers, health service providers and government agencies.
They increased in manufacturing and accommodation and food
services.  The data also showed firings waned. Total dismissals, which
exclude retirements and those who left their job voluntarily,
decreased to 1.5 million from 1.6 million a month before.  Another 2.27 million people quit their jobs in July, up
from 2.21 million the prior month. The quits rate climbed to 1.7
percent from 1.6 percent.  In the 12 months ended in July, the economy created a net
1.9 million jobs, representing 52.1 million hires and 50.2
million separations.  Considering the 11.5 million Americans who were  unemployed 
in July, today’s figures indicate there are about 3.1 people
vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the last
recession began in December 2007.  Private Payrolls  Payrolls data released last week also showed that private
employment, which excludes government agencies, climbed 152,000
in August after a revised gain of 127,000 in July that was
weaker than first reported.  While some companies are awaiting a pickup in sales before
adding to staff, Ford Motor Co., the second-largest U.S.
automaker, is among those putting more workers on assembly lines
as vehicle sales climb. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford plans to
boost fourth-quarter production by 7 percent. In August, the
company said an additional shift of 1,400 new workers at a
factory in Flat Rock,  Michigan , will help increase capacity.  Some businesses are taking steps to reduce staff. Cisco
Systems Inc., the biggest maker of networking equipment, in
August said it is cutting 4,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its
workforce, as weaker sales in  Japan ,  China  and  Europe  weigh on
revenue growth.  The Fed is likely to reduce asset purchases to $75 billion
this month, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 34 economists conducted on Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
