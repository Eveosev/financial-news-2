Confidence among U.S. small
businesses stagnated in August as weaker sales damped earnings
even as companies projected demand would improve and encourage
the addition of more workers.  The  National Federation of Independent Business ’s  optimism
index  was little changed at 94 last month from 94.1 in July.
Five of the measure’s 10 components improved, while four
declined, the Washington-based group said.  The net share of companies expecting business conditions to
improve during the next six months dropped 4 points to minus 10
percent, and the share of those with positive earnings trends
dropped 13 points to minus 35 percent. At the same time, the
share of business owners expecting  higher sales  rose 8 points to
15 percent in August, while those planning to hire more workers
climbed 7 points to 16 percent, the highest since January 2007.  “Overall, the index of optimism says the small-business
sector is going nowhere and that’s what if feels like,”  William Dunkelberg , the group’s chief economist, said in a statement.
The differences in expectations for business conditions and
sales improvement are “paradoxical at the macro level, although
with differing regional economies, possible.”  The NFIB report was based on a survey of 759 small-business
owners through Aug. 30. Small companies represent more than 99
percent of all U.S. employers, according to the U.S. Small
Business Administration. A small business is defined as an
independent enterprise with no more than 500 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
