Mergers and acquisitions in the
reinsurance industry may rise in coming years because of higher
valuations and the inflow of alternative capital, according to
Fitch Ratings Ltd.  The consolidation would improve companies’ credit profiles
as reducing the number of reinsurers and the “associated
underwriting capacity” may lift reinsurance prices, or at least
limit declines, the London-based ratings firm said in a
statement today.  Reinsurers are under pressure to shore up earnings hurt by
disaster claims and low  interest rates . Reinsurance rates fell
in seven of the last 10 years, according to the Guy Carpenter
World Property Catastrophe Rate on Line Index, while excess
capital further undercuts pricing.  “The reinsurance market has appeared a good candidate for
consolidation in recent years due to the level of undeployed
capital and the number of small and mid-size companies with
limited organic growth options,” Fitch said in the statement.
“The increasing availability of alternative reinsurance such as
catastrophe bonds could add to these trends by providing further
sources of capital to the market while reducing growth
opportunities for traditional reinsurers that are in direct
competition with the alternative providers.”  The reinsurance industry had capital of $510 billion at the
end of June, just short of a record $515 billion three months
earlier, according to Aon Benfield, the reinsurance broker of
Aon Ltd., which mediates deals for primary insurers.  The growth in broker-led passive underwriting facilities,
where a reinsurer agrees with a broker to automatically take on
a fixed proportion of all risks, also may fuel deal making by
pressuring smaller firms to merge as reinsurance prices come
under pressure, Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
