SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  Chief Executive
Officer William Rogers said his lender will be less conservative
when proposing capital actions during the Federal Reserve’s 2014
stress tests.  “For 2013, we said very publicly and I think appropriately
with an abundance of caution, we’re going to be conservative
with how we approached CCAR,” Rogers said today at a conference
in New York, referring to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and
Review. “Without declaring exactly where we’re going to be,
what I would say is we won’t have a conservative bias” in 2014,
he said.  SunTrust, based in Atlanta and Georgia’s biggest lender, in
March announced its first common-stock buyback since the
financial crisis after the Fed approved its capital plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
