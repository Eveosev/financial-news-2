BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  fell the most in
more than two months in Toronto trading after the Canadian
smartphone maker said it has cut its sales force and moved some
staff to the U.S. to bolster sluggish sales of its new devices.  BlackBerry is cutting 60 jobs, primarily in sales, Adam
Emery, a spokesman for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company, said
in a phone interview. The cuts and redeployment of salespeople
are intended to get employees closer to key customers in the
U.S., Emery said.  The company, which reports quarterly earnings on Sept. 27,
is struggling with tepid demand for its range of BlackBerry 10
phones first introduced in January. Chief Executive Officer
Thorsten Heins’s plan for the devices to lead a revival in sales
and market share has been overwhelmed by competition from  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iOS,  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows
Phone, which is now outselling BlackBerry.  BlackBerry sold almost a million fewer Z10 touch-screen
phones from March to May than analysts expected. The company
said in June it expected to record a loss for the quarter that
ended on Aug. 31.  Cantech Letter reported late yesterday that BlackBerry was
cutting its sales force, without citing any numbers.  BlackBerry fell 5.3 percent to C$11.33 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto, the most since July 2. The stock has slipped 4 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
