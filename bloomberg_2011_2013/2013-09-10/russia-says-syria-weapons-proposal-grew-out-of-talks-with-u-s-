Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said his proposal to urge  Syria  to give up its chemical
weapons to avoid U.S. military strikes came out of talks with
U.S. officials and is “not entirely” a Russian initiative.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  said yesterday that  Russia ’s
proposal is a “potential breakthrough” and Russia is now
working with Syria on developing a detailed plan on how the
process would work, Lavrov told reporters in Moscow today.  Russia expects to complete the plan and present it to the
United Nations Security Council “soon,” Lavrov said after
meeting with his Libyan counterpart, Mohamed Abdulaziz.  “The proposal to put Syrian chemical weapons under
international control isn’t entirely a Russian proposal,”
Lavrov said. “It stems from contacts we had with our American
colleagues.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
