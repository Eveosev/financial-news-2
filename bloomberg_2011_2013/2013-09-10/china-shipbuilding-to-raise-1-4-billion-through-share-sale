China Shipbuilding Industry Co. (601989) , a
supplier to the Chinese army, plans to raise as much as 8.48
billion yuan ($1.4 billion) from the sale of shares to acquire
assets used to assemble military equipment and fund projects.  The company will offer as many as 2.2 billion shares in a
private placement for no less than 3.84 yuan each, it said in a
statement to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  today. It will purchase
assets including some from its parent, according to the
statement.  China Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd., the
country’s largest shipyard outside state control that is seeking
government assistance after a slump in vessel orders, is
pursuing alternative sources of funding after burning through
cash and posting a second straight loss. China announced its
support for the industry as a third of its shipyards may shut
down in about five years amid a global vessel glut.  China Shipbuilding’s shares will resume trading on the
Shanghai exchange tomorrow after being halted since May.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
