U.K. stocks  advanced to their
highest level in more than three weeks as a measure of house
prices jumped and economic reports from China beat forecasts.  Gauges of London-listed construction and mining companies
gained. Glencore Xstrata Plc rose 2.3 percent after increasing
its estimate of the synergies from the takeover of Xstrata Plc.
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  slid 2.5 percent for the largest drag on the
 FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  as investors assessed U.S. guidelines for
bringing generic versions of Glaxo’s asthma drug to market.  The FTSE 100 gained 53.25 points, or 0.8 percent, to
6,583.99 at the close of trading in London. The equity benchmark
has still  fallen 3.8 percent  since May 22, which was its highest
level since 1999, amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will
begin reducing its monthly asset purchases as early as this
year. The broader FTSE All-Share Index added 0.9 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 1 percent.  “The improvement in the housing market boils down to
confidence,” Leigh Himsworth, who helps oversee about $1
billion as head of U.K. equities at City Financial in  London ,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s a feel-good factor in many
people’s lives and goes a long way to explaining why investors
and corporates are happier to invest.”  The number of shares trading hands in FTSE 100-listed
stocks was 17 percent greater than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  House Prices  A gauge of U.K. house prices rose to the highest level
since November 2006 in August as the government’s Help to Buy
plan and the economic recovery increased demand. The  Royal
Institution  of Chartered Surveyors’  index , which is based on a
poll of property surveyors, increased to 40 from a revised 37 in
July. A proxy measure of demand rose to a record, while the
outlook for prices advanced to the highest since 2002.  Housebuilders listed on the broader FTSE 350 Index rose
with Bellway Plc adding 1.3 percent to 1,404 pence.  Taylor
Wimpey Plc  gained 1.3 percent to 107.3 pence and Berkeley Group
Holdings Plc advanced 1.2 percent to 2,198 pence.  In China,  industrial output  rose 10.4 percent in August
from a year earlier. Economists had predicted that production
would increase 9.9 percent after a 9.7 percent gain in July,
according to the median estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Retail
sales (CNRSCYOY)  jumped 13.4 percent, compared with a projected 13.3
percent advance and a 13.2 percent climb the previous month.  Mining Companies  The FTSE 350 Mining Index added 1.8 percent to its highest
level since May 22 as BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group rose
1.7 percent to 1,939 pence and 2.8 percent to 3,217.5 pence,
respectively.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  gained 2.4 percent to 1,632
pence, paring its  decline this year  to 14 percent.  Glencore Xstrata advanced 2.3 percent to 328.75 pence, its
seventh day of gains. The acquisition will generate a minimum of
$2 billion in synergies including cost savings next year, the
Baar, Switzerland-based company said in a statement. That
exceeded its initial forecast of $500 million.  Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM)  rallied 5.3 percent to 382.2 pence, its
highest price in more than three months. The  fund manager , which
specializes in  emerging markets , said it will pay a final
 dividend  of 11.75 pence a share, compared with 10.75 pence a
share a year earlier.  Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)  surged 17 percent to 219.3
pence as trading resumed after the company won a lawsuit brought
by a former business partner. The ex-U.S. Special Forces captain
had sought a stake in the explorer’s projects in  Iraq . The judge
ruled that the claimant’s company, Excalibur Ventures LLC,
failed to meet its obligations under a contract with Gulf
Keystone, so it had no valid claim.  GlaxoSmithKline Drops  Glaxo, which  accounts for  4.7 percent of the FTSE 100,
declined 2.5 percent to 1,598.5 pence. The  Food and Drug
Administration  revised its guidelines for introducing generic
versions of Glaxo’s Advair drug, making it easier for
competitors to sell their own products, according to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. The rule changes increase pressure on Glaxo’s
forthcoming treatments because Advair accounts for about 10
percent of the drugmaker’s U.S. sales, Goldman Sachs said.  Whitbread Plc slipped 2.4 percent to 3,138 pence after
saying like-for-like sales grew 3 percent at its  Costa Coffee (WTB) 
shops in the 11 weeks through Aug. 15. That compares with 8
percent growth for the 13-week period ending May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
