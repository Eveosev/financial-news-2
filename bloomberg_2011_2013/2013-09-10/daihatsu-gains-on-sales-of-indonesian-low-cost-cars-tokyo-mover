Daihatsu Motor Co. (7262)  rose the most in
four weeks in Tokyo trading as the automaker and parent  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  began selling models suited for Indonesia’s
incentive program for fuel-efficient vehicles.  Shares of Daihatsu  gained  3.5 percent, the most since Aug.
13, to 1,950 yen,at the close in Tokyo trading. The  benchmark 
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average added 1.5 percent.  Daihatsu’s new Ayla compact, sold as the Agya under
Toyota’s brand, comes as the Indonesian government introduces
subsidies and tax breaks for cheap, low-emission cars. The
automaker based in  Osaka ,  Japan  that is about 51 percent  owned 
by Toyota, plans to sell 4,000 Ayla cars a month, while Toyota
targets monthly sales of 5,000 Agya models.  “Its cheap, and because there wasn’t a compact model like
this in  Indonesia  before, Daihatsu may be creating an entirely
new market,” Koichi Sugimoto, a Tokyo-based auto analyst at BNP
Paribas SA, said. “The Indonesian government is pushing to
expand the market with the incentives, and the model will be
very important for Daihatsu.”  The Ayla will start from 76.1 million rupiah ($6,700),
while Toyota’s Agya will start from 99 million rupiah, according
to the companies. Both models will be built at Daihatsu’s
factory in Indonesia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
