Asia’s liquefied natural gas market
is poised to introduce alternatives to oil-indexed pricing as
supply expands from new sources, according to the International
Energy Agency.  “When you have a more flexible gas market, with more gas
being brought to Asia, it will certainly help” lead to new gas-pricing methods, Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the
IEA, said in  Tokyo  today.  An estimated 80 new LNG tankers are under construction in
South Korea and  Japan  and not committed to long-term contracts,
helping to increase delivery options, she said. Gas will come to
Asia in a couple of years from  Russia , which has the world’s
largest reserves, as it looks for new markets to replace slowing
European and domestic demand, van der Hoeven said. The U.S. has
approved exports of LNG from three projects.  “There’s new LNG from North America, new ships being
built, and discussion going on in Asia that something needs to
be done,” van der Hoeven said.  There have been proposals to move LNG prices away from the
market’s traditional oil link toward exchange-traded futures
contracts or natural gas benchmarks.  The IEA is also working with the International Energy
Forum, OPEC and gas-exporting countries to create a joint data
initiative for gas as regional markets become global, van der
Hoeven said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
