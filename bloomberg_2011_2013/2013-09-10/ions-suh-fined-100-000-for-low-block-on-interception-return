Detroit Lions defensive tackle
 Ndamukong Suh  was fined $100,000 for an illegal block during his
team’s season-opening win against the Minnesota Vikings.  It is another in a succession of infractions by the Pro
Bowl player during his four-year National Football League
career.  Merton Hanks, the NFL’s vice president of football
operations, informed Suh yesterday that he was fined for
violating a rule that prohibits blocks below the waist by
players of either team after a change of possession, the league
said in an e-mailed statement.  The play occurred during the second quarter of Detroit’s
34-24 win against the Vikings three days ago, when Suh dived at
the legs of Vikings center  John Sullivan  following an
interception by Lions linebacker DeAndre Levy. Levy’s touchdown
on the play was nullified by the infraction.  Suh, the second player selected in the 2010  NFL draft , said
after the game that he wasn’t going after the knees of Sullivan,
who had microfracture surgery during the offseason, and that the
two spoke at halftime, according to ESPN. Sullivan said he was
surprised he wasn’t seriously injured on the play, ESPN
reported.  Suh was fined $30,000 by the NFL in November for striking
Houston Texans quarterback  Matt Schaub  in the groin with his
foot during a game. The play came a year after Suh stomped on
the arm of a Green Bay Packers player, for which he was
suspended two games and offered a public apology. He was fined
three times by the league prior to the ban and met with NFL
Commissioner  Roger Goodell  to discuss how to better play within
the rules.  Career Fines  Suh had tallied $77,500 in fines before yesterday and has
made $51.7 million in his four-year NFL career, according to the
Detroit Free Press.  The NFL’s largest fine against an individual was in 1999,
when former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo was fined
$1 million for his involvement in a gambling-fraud case. New
England Patriots coach  Bill Belichick  was fined $500,000 in 2007
after his team broke NFL rules by videotaping the New York Jets’
signals during a game. The  New Orleans Saints  were fined the
same amount in 2012 in connection for what the league determined
to be a bounty program rewarding big hits.  Tennessee Titans owner  Bud Adams  was fined $250,000 in 2009
for making obscene hand gestures during a win over the Buffalo
Bills. Former All-Pro  Ray Lewis  also was fined $250,000, for
obstructing an investigation into a double murder following a
post-Super Bowl fight outside an Atlanta night club in January
2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
