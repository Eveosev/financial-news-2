China’s outgoing Premier  Wen Jiabao 
said he didn’t do some of his work well enough and asked for
forgiveness, the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.  “Even if I tried my best, I always feel some work hasn’t
been done well enough,” Wen said during a visit to a Beijing
neighborhood, as cited by Xinhua. “I feel guilty and often
blame myself, hoping to get understanding and forgiveness from
everybody,” Wen said. The agency didn’t give further details.  Wen is due to step down as premier in March at an annual
session of China’s Parliament. His family has come under
scrutiny after the  New York  Times published a report in October
documenting how its members accumulated billions of dollars
through business dealings.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
