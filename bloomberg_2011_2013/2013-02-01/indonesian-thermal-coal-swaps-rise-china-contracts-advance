Swaps prices rose for thermal coal
for next month’s loading from  Indonesia , the world’s largest
exporter of the fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore
Pte.  The contract for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in February
increased 5 cents to $64.65 a metric ton on a net-as-received
basis yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The swap in the
second quarter was unchanged at $66.10 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the
second quarter advanced 60 cents to $87.85 a ton on a net-as-
received basis, the energy broker said. The February contract
rose 5 cents to $85.55 a ton.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period. About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is
classified as sub-bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower
carbon content reduce the heating value compared with better-
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has fewer than 6,100 kilocalories
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
