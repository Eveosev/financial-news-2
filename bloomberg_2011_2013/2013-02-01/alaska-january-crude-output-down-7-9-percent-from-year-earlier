Oil production from Alaska’s North
Slope dropped 7.9 percent in January from a year earlier as
output from wells declined and new ones weren’t added.  Production  averaged 576,959 barrels a day last month, down
from 626,155 in  January 2012 , the state tax division said on its
website.  December  output was 582,150 barrels a day.  Alaska’s North Slope has been yielding less oil every year
since 2002 as output from wells naturally declines. The
shrinking supply has spurred refiners on the U.S. West Coast,
including  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  and  Phillips 66 (PSX) , to pursue rail shipments
from the U.S. Midwest and prompted Flint Hills Resources LLC to
shut a crude unit at its North Pole refinery in Alaska.  “We haven’t had any new fields come online this month,”
Ed King, petroleum economist for Alaska’s tax division in
Anchorage, Alaska, said by telephone. “So we just continue to
see the same natural decline we’ve seen in previous months.”  Inventories of the feedstock at the Valdez marine terminal,
the northernmost ice-free port in North America, averaged 3.58
million barrels last month, ranging from a high of 4.97 million
on Jan. 19 to a low of 2.49 million on Jan. 7, according to the
tax division.  Alaska North Slope crude  was unchanged at a premium of
$14.50 a barrel to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate at
1:55 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
