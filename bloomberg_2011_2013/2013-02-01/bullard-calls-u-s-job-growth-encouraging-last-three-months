President James Bullard said U.S. job growth in the past three
months has been “an encouraging sign for the U.S. economy.”  Payroll growth averaging about 200,000 jobs a month has
been “impressive” and supports his forecast for the economic
expansion to accelerate to about 3 percent this year, Bullard
said today in an interview in  Washington .  U.S. employers added 157,000 jobs in January after a
revised 196,000 advance in the prior month, the Labor Department
reported today. The unemployment rate increased to 7.9 percent
from 7.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
