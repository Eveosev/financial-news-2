Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , India’s largest
wind-turbine maker, received approval to put 66 units of its
2.1-megawatt turbine at the Cookhouse wind farm in  South Africa .  Suzlon, based in Pune, India, was selected to develop the
project in the first round of renewable energy auctions held by
the African nation in 2011, it said in a statement to stock
exchanges today.  The company, which said its lead bankers for the project
include The  Standard Bank  of South Africa Ltd. and Nedbank Ltd.,
didn’t give information about the project’s value. It plans to
generate 2,000 megawatts of power in the country within five
years, Silas Zimu, chief executive officer of Suzlon’s South
African unit said in April.  Suzlon  shares  rose as much as 8.2 percent to 26.55 rupees
and traded at 25.60 rupees as of 12:19 p.m. in Mumbai today. The
stock, which has gained 37 percent this year, fell to 14.95
rupees on Aug. 29, the lowest since its 2005 listing.  The wind energy company’s lenders last week approved a 95-
billion rupee ($1.78 billion) debt restructuring plan, which
will help bring down its debt repayment costs. Suzlon on Oct. 11
failed to pay $209 million, the biggest convertible note default
by an Indian company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
