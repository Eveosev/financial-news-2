State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan  said
production from the BP Plc-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field was
unchanged in January from a year earlier, indicating that output
has recovered from a dip during 2012.  “The ACG field produced the same volume of oil in January
compared with year ago, thus stemming the drop in output,”
Rovnaq Abdullayev, president of the  oil company  known as Socar,
said today in Baku.  Volumes from the ACG field, which accounted for 78 percent
of the country’s production in 2011, fell 12 percent in the
first half of last year. BP replaced regional managers after
President  Ilham Aliyev  accused it of making mistakes.  BP and its partners, which also include Statoil ASA and
Chevron Corp., have sought to extend their production-sharing
accord beyond 2024 to allow them to recoup investments. Socar,
keen to develop the field on its own after the contract expires,
said today that an extension was “not on the agenda.”  BP and Socar are also partners at the Shah Deniz gas field
off the Azeri coast, which is scheduled to pump its first fuel
in 2018. A final  investment decision  on developing the deposit,
which may send 10 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe that
year, will be made at the end of 2013, Abdullayev said today.  BP’s other partners at Shah Deniz include Statoil, Total
SA, OAO Lukoil, Turkiye Petrolleri AO and Naftiran Intertrade
Co.  Azerbaijan  is the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , after Russia and Kazakhstan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
