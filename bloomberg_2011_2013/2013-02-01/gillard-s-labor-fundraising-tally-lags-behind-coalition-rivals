Australian Prime Minister  Julia
Gillard ’s ruling  Labor party , trailing in polls ahead of the
Sept. 14 election, also lagged behind her rival Liberal-National
coalition in donations in the most recent period disclosed.  Labor’s various branches received reported donations of
about A$3.6 million ($3.8 million) in the year to June 30,
according to Bloomberg analysis of Australian Electoral
Commission  data  released today. That compares with about A$7.3
million in reported donations for the opposition coalition.  Among the biggest reported donors in the period for Labor
were the Canberra Labor Club, which runs four food and
entertainment venues in the nation’s capital, with more than A$1
million; Labor-affiliated John Curtin House with about
A$800,000; and various contributions from union bodies. The
Liberals received A$2.3 million from a foundation set up for
fundraising; the Australian Hotels Association donated
A$250,000; and  Ramsay Health Care Ltd. (RHC)  contributed A$100,000.  The figures come two days after Gillard announced the poll
date, setting  Australia  up for its longest election campaign.
The Tony Abbott-led coalition has pledged to rescind Labor’s
taxes on carbon and mining profits, installed July 1.  Total donor returns in the year to all parties and
candidates totaled A$12.8 million, less than half the A$29.2
million the year before, which included the August 2010
election. Labor collected A$49.6 million in total receipts,
which include other sources of income, in the year to June 30,
compared with A$55.1 million for the Liberals and A$8.2 million
for the Nationals.  Labor rose 3 percentage points to 49 percent on a two-party
preferred basis, with the coalition falling 3 points to 51
percent, according to a Newspoll survey published Jan. 15. The
measure is the best gauge of which major party is likely to win
the seats required to form a government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
