Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru and  Mexico , delayed the projected
startup of its $900 million Tia Maria mine by a year to 2016
after taking longer than expected to complete a new
environmental impact study.  Southern Copper has finished the study and expects
government approval in the second half, said Raul Jacob, chief
financial officer of the company’s Peruvian unit. The company
will then seek to invest $250 million per year in the mine.  Peru’s government ordered Phoenix-based Southern Copper to
redo an environmental study for Tia Maria after deadly
environmental protests suspended the project in 2011. The study
was originally due to be completed in November, Chief Executive
Officer Oscar Gonzalez Rocha said in an Oct. 1 interview.  “For 2013 we’re considering spending $46 million,
contingent to getting the approval of the environmental impact
assessment through the year,” Jacob said today on a conference
call. “Certainly a condition for that will be having the
goodwill from the local communities.”  Southern Copper  aims to produce 640,000 metric tons of
copper this year, little changed from 2012, Jacob said. The
company will cut third-party concentrate purchases by 29 percent
to 10,000 tons and invest $1.8 billion in expansion projects in
2013, he said.  Southern Copper late yesterday announced fourth-quarter net
income of $531.8 million, or 63 cents a share, beating analysts’
estimates. The shares gained 1.1 percent to $39.84 at the close
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
