Reinsurance Group of America Inc. ,
the reinsurer formerly owned by  MetLife Inc. (MET) , advanced after
fourth-quarter  profit  climbed, beating analysts’ estimates.  Reinsurance Group rose 2.2 percent to $58.66 at 4:14 p.m.
in New York. Net income increased 61 percent to $223 million
from $138.6 million a year earlier, the company said late
yesterday in a statement. Operating profit, which excludes some
investment results, was $2.44 a share, beating by 65 cents the
average  estimate  of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Results in  North America  fueled the profit gain at the
Chesterfield, Missouri-based company, which also operates in
Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The firm shoulders risk for
primary life insurers and can benefit when there are fewer
deaths than expected.  “The fourth quarter benefited primarily from favorable
individual mortality and annuity results in the U.S. and strong
results in  Canada ,” Chief Executive Officer Greig Woodring said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
