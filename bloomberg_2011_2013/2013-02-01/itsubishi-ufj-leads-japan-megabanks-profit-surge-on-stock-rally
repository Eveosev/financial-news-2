Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) 
led quarterly profit increases at  Japan ’s three megabanks as
government stimulus plans spurred a stock market rally, easing
losses on shareholdings and boosting fee income.  The country’s biggest lender by market value yesterday
posted  net income  that doubled to 242 billion yen ($2.6 billion)
in the three months ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier.  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  earlier this week also doubled
profit, putting it on track for a record annual income, and
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ’s earnings jumped to 207.5 billion
yen from 16.3 billion yen.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s pledge to stimulate the economy
has spurred a 30 percent jump in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
since elections were announced in mid-November. The banks are
also benefiting from signs of a recovery in domestic lending
with credit by city banks climbing for the first time in three
years in December.  “Abe-nomics and rising equity prices were a tailwind for
the big banks last quarter, cutting stockholding losses and
boosting fees from mutual fund sales,” Shinichiro Nakamura, a
Tokyo-based analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., said.
“Whether or not the banks’ profit growth is sustainable hinges
partly on Japan’s monetary easing and economic stimulus.”  Losses Ease  Combined losses from shareholdings of the three banks
narrowed to 265.7 billion yen in the nine months through Dec. 31
from 534 billion yen in the six months ended Sept. 30, based on
lenders’ data.  Mitsubishi UFJ’s  income  from fees and commissions rose 8.5
percent to 244 billion yen, in the three months ended Dec. 31,
offsetting a decline in lending profit to 433.5 billion yen,
according to calculations based on yesterday’s statement. Profit
from trading  government bonds  and other securities plunged 22
percent.  Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ slipped 1.2 percent to close at
515 yen in Tokyo ahead of the earnings announcement. The stock
climbed 26 percent last quarter. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
rose 0.5 percent yesterday, capping a 12-week advance, the
longest weekly winning streak since at least 1970.  Third-quarter results were calculated by subtracting first-
half profit from nine-month figures reported to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. Quarterly net income beat the 238.5 billion yen
average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Year-Ago Gain  Profit for the nine months ended Dec. 31 dropped 35 percent
to 532.5 billion yen, the company said in the statement.
Mitsubishi UFJ maintained its profit target of 670 billion yen
for the year ending March.  The decline in nine-month profit reflects a year-ago gain
of 291 billion yen from converting its Morgan Stanley shares
into common stock.  Japan’s economy, the world’s third largest, is showing
recovery signs following two quarters of contraction. Industrial
production rose the most in 18 months in December, government
figures showed Dec. 31.  Loans outstanding at Japan’s city banks rose 0.3 percent in
December, the first increase since October 2009, according to
central bank data. Including regional banks, lending increased
1.4 percent.  Brokerage Rebounds  Mitsubishi UFJ’s profit growth was boosted by an earnings
rebound at its brokerage business. Mitsubishi UFJ Securities
Holdings Co. on Dec. 31 posted a profit of 10.1 billion yen last
quarter, reversing a loss of 12.3 billion yen a year earlier.  Sumitomo Mitsui  on Jan. 30 posted third-quarter net income
of 219.4 billion yen, after the bank’s SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc. unit rebounded to a profit in the period.  Lending income  gained 9.1 percent in the quarter from a
year earlier to 355.8 billion yen, according to Bloomberg
calculations. Fees and commissions income rose 13.7 percent to
224.9 billion yen, and profit from trading government bonds and
other securities more than doubled to 107.4 billion yen.  Mizuho’s surge in net income, reported on Jan. 31, was also
boosted by a return to profit at its brokerage unit. The
business posted a profit of 1.1 billion yen, compared with a
loss of 36.7 billion yen.  Its lending profit rose 5.9 percent last quarter from a
year earlier to 269.5 billion yen, according to calculations
based on Mizuho’s statement. Income from fees and commissions
surged 19 percent to 123.2 billion yen, while trading profit
gained 13 percent to 92 billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
