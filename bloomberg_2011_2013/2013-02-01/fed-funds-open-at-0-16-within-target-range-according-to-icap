Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.16 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent on yesterday after trading
from 0.09 percent to 0.16 percent and averaging 0.14 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire $750 million to $1 billion of
Treasuries maturing from February 2023 to February 2031. The
