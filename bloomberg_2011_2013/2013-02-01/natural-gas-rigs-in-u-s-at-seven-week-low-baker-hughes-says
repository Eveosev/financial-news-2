Oil rigs in the U.S. advanced to the
highest level since December as energy producers, responding to
a $10-a-barrel rise in crude prices over the last three months,
picked up drilling activity in shale plays.  The  oil rig count  rose by 17 to 1,332, the biggest weekly
gain since June, data posted on  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) ’s website
show.  Gas rigs  dropped by six to 428, a seven-week low, the
field-services company based in Houston said. Total energy rigs
rose a second week, adding 11 to 1,764.  Oil futures have risen 12 percent since Nov. 1, luring some
companies back into shale plays, said  James Williams , president
of WTRG Economics in  London , Arkansas. Last week’s oil rig count
of 1,315 was the lowest since March.  “It looks like the oil count has probably found its
bottom,” Williams said by telephone. “Rigs are starting to
reflect stronger  oil prices , and we’re getting a little bit of
movement. The Eagle Ford, Permian,  North Dakota  and  Oklahoma 
were the hot spots for oil rigs this week.”  Crude for March delivery rose 28 cents to settle at $97.77
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , capping the eighth
consecutive weekly gain.  Rising Output  U.S. oil output  climbed  4,000 barrels a day to 6.99 million
last week, according to the Energy Information Administration, a
division of the Energy Department. Production rose to the
highest level since 1993 on Jan. 11. Stockpiles increased 1.6
percent to 369.1 million barrels last week.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is “ramping up rig activity” in the
Marcellus formation on the U.S. East Coast and the Permian in
West Texas and  New Mexico , John S. Watson, the company’s chief
executive officer, said today.  Rig activity in the Utica formation, which reaches from
 Tennessee  to  New York , is also accelerating and will attract
greater interest from producers this year and next, Biliana Pehlivanova, an analyst for  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s investment-banking
unit in New York, said in a research note today.  Rigs in the Utica play, mostly targeted at natural gas and
gas liquids, “have trended confidently higher, and well permits
jumped to 381 in 2012, from 86 in 2011,” she said.  Natural gas for March delivery fell 3.8 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $3.301 per million British thermal units
in New York. Futures are up 73 percent from the 52-week low set
in April.  Texas gained the most rigs this week, adding seven to 826.
Louisiana lost the most, falling by three to 106.  Rigs on land  jumped by 12 to 1,695.  Rigs in inland  waters
fell by two to 16, the lowest since Nov. 9.  Vertical rigs  were unchanged at 445. Horizontal rigs
climbed by nine to 1,136, the most since September.  The  offshore  rig count gained one to 53, while rigs in  Gulf
of Mexico  were unchanged at 51.  Canadian energy rigs  rose for the fifth week, increasing by
four to 625, the highest level since March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
