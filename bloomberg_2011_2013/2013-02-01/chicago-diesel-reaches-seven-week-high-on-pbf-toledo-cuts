Chicago  diesel fuel strengthened to
the highest level in seven weeks against futures as  PBF Energy
Inc. (PBF)  shut a unit at its Toledo, Ohio, refinery, reducing
regional supplies.  PBF cut production rates on some units and closed a fluid
catalytic cracker after a fire Jan. 30. The refinery, which can
process 170,000 barrels a day, may take “several weeks” to
operate at planned rates, the company said in a statement.  Supplies of distillates in the Midwest fell 1.07 million
barrels to 30.3 million in the week ended Jan. 25, the lowest
seasonal level since 2008, according to Energy Information
Administration data. Refineries in the region, known as PADD 2,
processed less crude and other feedstocks for the  third
consecutive week .  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in Chicago rose 1.5 cents to 3
cents a gallon above heating oil futures on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 2:32 p.m. New York time. That’s the
fuel’s highest premium since Dec. 11, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
was unchanged at the time after climbing 7 cents yesterday to
13.5 cents below futures, its narrowest discount since Dec. 7.  In the midcontinent, or Group 3 market, ULSD gained 2.25
cents to a 1-cent premium.  Reformulated gasoline in New York Harbor, or RBOB,
increased 0.75 cent to parity with futures at 3:40 p.m. as
Philadelphia Energy Solutions shut units at the largest East
Coast refinery for planned maintenance and a fluid catalytic
cracker at Delta Air Lines Inc.’s Trainer plant will be down
until next week.  ULSD at the trading hub strengthened 0.25 cent to 6.75
cents above futures.  In the  Gulf Coast , RBOB weakened 0.75 cent to 16.5 cents
below futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
