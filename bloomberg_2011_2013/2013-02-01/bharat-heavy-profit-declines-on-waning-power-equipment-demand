Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) ,
India’s biggest maker of power-plant equipment, had a worse-
than-expected 17 percent drop in third-quarter profit as funding
delays prompted customers to hold back orders.  Net income fell to 11.8 billion rupees ($221 million) in
the three months ended Dec. 31 from 14.3 billion rupees a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement. The median of 34
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 13.5 billion rupees.
Sales dropped almost 5 percent to 100.4 billion rupees.  Revenue from the power-generation equipment business, which
accounts for more than 75 percent of Bharat Heavy’s sales,
dropped almost 5 percent in the quarter. Sales from the industry
business, comprising locomotives and power-transmission gear,
fell 5.5 percent.  “Non-availability of land and difficulty in arranging
equity funding by promoters delayed power plants from placing
orders,” said Lakshminarayana Ganti, an analyst with Standard
Chartered Securities  India  Ltd. in Mumbai. “To reinvigorate the
power-generation sector, issues relating to coal prices, power-
purchase agreements and the health of state distribution
companies need to be addressed.”  Competition from overseas suppliers, including  Shanghai
Electric Group Co. (601727)  and Dongfang Electric Corp., and higher
capacity at local rivals led to a drop in power-equipment prices
in India. New orders have slowed as lack of fuel supplies and
environmental approvals are holding up new projects.  State-run Bharat Heavy had orders of 1.14 trillion rupees
in the quarter, compared with 1.22 trillion rupees in the
previous three months.  The  shares  plunged as much as 4.7 percent to 217.10 rupees,
the biggest decline in three months. The stock has lost 11
percent in the past year, compared with a 15 percent increase in
the benchmark  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
