Indian (SENSEX)  stocks declined, with the
benchmark index posting its biggest weekly drop since November,
amid concern a recent rally has made valuations expensive and
after earnings from some companies missed analysts’ forecasts.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 0.5 percent
to 19,789.25, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai. It fell 1.6 percent this week.  Bharti Airtel
Ltd. (BHARTI) , the nation’s largest cell-phone operator, slumped 3.2
percent in a seventh day of losses as profit lagged estimates.
 Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC)  lost 2.2 after rallying 27 percent last
month, the biggest monthly increase since May 2009.  The Sensex completed a third month of gains in January as
foreign funds purchased a net $3.9 billion of local shares last
month, a record for the period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gauge trades at 15.8 times  estimated earnings ,
near the highest level in 12 months, the data show. The MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index is valued at 10.9 times.  Five out of 17, or 29 percent, of Sensex firms that have
announced December-quarter  earnings  have trailed estimates,
compared with 40 percent in the previous two quarters, the data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
