The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index advanced the most
in almost a month, paring a weekly decline as stocks linked to
consumer demand gained after better-than-forecast industrial
output bolstered the outlook for  Brazil ’s economic growth.  Hypermarcas SA, the maker of more than 180 products from
pharmaceuticals to diapers, jumped to the highest since May
2011. Card-payment processor Cielo SA had its biggest weekly
advance in three months. Mining company Vale SA climbed after
fourth-quarter iron-ore output beat forecasts.  The Bovespa gained 1 percent to 60,351.16 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, paring its drop this week to 1.3 percent.
Forty-eight stocks rose on the measure today while 18 fell. The
real strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.988 per  U.S. dollar  after a
report showed industrial production slid 3.6 percent in December
from a year earlier, less than the 4.8 percent median forecast
of 29 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  “The industrial output was slightly better than expected,
and maybe that could be the turning point for economic activity,
which has been sluggish,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, an analyst at
Futura Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview.
“Stocks haven’t been doing so well because of concern about
growth, among other things.”  Brazil’s industrial  production  was unchanged in December

Itau BBA cut its recommendation on the commercial services
provider to the equivalent of hold.  Bull Market  The Bovespa entered a  bull market  on Jan. 3 after rising 21
percent from last year’s low on June 5 as stimulus from central
banks around the world eased concern that economic growth might
miss expectations while borrowing costs at a record low in
Brazil boosted equity demand. The index has since pared its
advance to 15 percent.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.2 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 11 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 7.32 billion
