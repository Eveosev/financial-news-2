Canadian  consumer confidence  rose to
its highest in eight months in January, as the country’s job
market improved.  The Nanos Economic Mood Index -- an aggregate of survey
responses on the outlook for the economy,  job security , personal
finances and real estate -- rose to 103.8 in January from 101.9
a month earlier. The index averaged 101.7 in the last six months
of 2012, compared with 105.4 in the first half of last year.  “We are now seeing an improvement in terms of perceptions
of job security,” said  Nik Nanos , president of the Ottawa-based
polling agency, adding cuts to federal payrolls hurt confidence
last year.  Canada’s  unemployment  fell to a four-year low in December
of 7.1 percent, adding to evidence the economy probably
strengthened at the end of last year after stalling for much of
the second half. While output grew 0.3 percent in November, the
fastest pace in seven months, data published to date suggest the
Canadian economy may have had its worst six-month performance
since the end of 2009.  Measures calculating perceptions of job security and
personal finances improved in January, according to today’s
Nanos poll. The balance of opinion between those who say their
jobs are secure and those who believe they are not rose to 34.3
percentage points, up from 30.6 in December and 29.7 in
November.  Net perceptions on personal finances improved to negative
10.5 from negative 16.3 in December, while the balance of
opinion indicator that gauges optimism about future growth
increased to 4.8 percentage points, the highest since April. The
measure calculating optimism about real estate values fell to
16.7 in January from 20.6 in the prior month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
