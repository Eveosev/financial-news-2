(Corrects headline to say considers rather than plans.)  Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Autogrill SpA, the world’s biggest
manager of airport and highway restaurants, said it’s
considering splitting its two main divisions.  A separation may entail a “partial, proportional
demerger” of the travel retail and duty free unit from the food
and beverage division, the Novara, Italy-based company said
today in a statement.  Autogrill got about 69 percent of its 5.8 billion euros
($7.9 billion) of revenue in 2011 from the food and beverage
unit, according to the company’s website.  The travel retail unit includes the World Duty Free chain
of airport shops and had revenue of 1.82 billion euros in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
