 Chinese billionaire Yu Yong’s Cathay
Fortune Corp. will not proceed with a bid to acquire  Discovery
Metals Ltd. (DML)  over concerns related to the Australian company’s
copper project in Botswana.  Cathay Fortune Investment Ltd., the bidding group that
consists of Shanghai-based Cathay Fortune and partner China-
Africa Development Fund will allow its offer, which closes Feb.
15, to lapse, it said today in a statement to the Australian
stock exchange.  Discovery shares fell 3.3 percent to A$1.04, their lowest
level since Sept. 7, at the close in Sydney today.  Cathay Fortune extended its A$1.70 a share offer period
this week for a third time. The bid went hostile in October
after Discovery rejected the offer as too low. Cathay Fortune
held 15.18 percent of Discovery, according to a Jan. 29
statement from the Shanghai-based private equity firm, which
would have valued the bid at A$702 million ($730 million).  Cathay Fortune extended its offer to study a downgrade in
reserves and lower-than-expected ore grades at the Zeta deposit
in Botswana, it said in a statement on Jan. 30. Discovery said
in a statement today Cathay Fortune’s concerns were  “ill-
founded.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
