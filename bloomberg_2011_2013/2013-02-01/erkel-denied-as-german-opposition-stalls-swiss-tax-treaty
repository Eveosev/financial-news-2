German opposition parties blocked a
treaty to combat tax dodging in Switzerland, stalling Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s agenda in an election year.  The vote in the upper house of parliament in Berlin today
extended the legislative deadlock over the project, which the
Swiss Bankers’ Association has already declared dead. The Social
Democrat-led opposition holds a majority in the chamber after a
series of state election losses by Merkel’s governing coalition
starting in 2010.  Merkel is seeking a third term in federal parliamentary
elections probably being held Sept. 22.  Peer Steinbrueck , her
first-term finance minister and Social Democratic challenger
this year, has called for renegotiating the treaty.  The draft agreement imposes a withholding tax on Swiss
accounts held by Germans and would help end German authorities’
practice of using stolen Swiss bank data to find tax evaders.  Merkel’s coalition majority in the lower house, or
Bundestag, rejected changes in the pact in a vote last month.
That sent the proposal back to the upper house, an assembly of
 Germany ’s 16 state governments, which previously stopped the
bill in November.  Germany earmarked 499 million euros ($681 million) in
revenue from the tax accord for the 2013  federal budget ,
according to Finance Ministry spokeswoman Silke Bruns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
