Pennon Group Plc (PNN) , the U.K.’s third-
largest publicly traded water utility, said today that its waste
management company Viridor won a 30-year treatment contract with
Peterborough’s city council.  Pennon, based in Exeter, said in a statement that the
public-private partnership pact to treat the council’s residual
waste requires the development of an energy-from-waste facility,
part of a project involving an investment of about 75 million
pounds ($118 million). Other terms weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
