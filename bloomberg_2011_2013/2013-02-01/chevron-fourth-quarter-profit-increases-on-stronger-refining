Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said fourth-quarter profit increased 41
percent to a record $7.25 billion as it reported stronger
refining results and a gain from an Australian natural gas field
swap.  Net income rose to $3.70 a share from $2.58, or $5.12
billion, a year earlier, the  San Ramon , California-based company
said in a statement today. Chevron was  expected  to report per-
share profit of $3.06, based on the average of 19 analysts’
estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales fell 3 percent to $56.3
billion.  Chevron’s refining segment returned to profit from a loss a
year earlier as rising supplies from U.S. shale formations
lowered crude input costs and processing  margins  climbed 46
percent. Chevron also benefited as crude prices rose in
international energy markets. About 75 percent of the company’s
crude is pumped from non-U.S. wells.  Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson
plans to spend $36.7 billion this year to explore for oil, build
gas export terminals and upgrade oil refineries. The company
expects to reach output equivalent to 3.3 million barrels a day
in 2017.  “Strong cash flows allowed us to invest aggressively in
our major capital projects and to acquire several important, new
resource opportunities,” Watson said. “We also raised the
dividend on our common shares for the 25th consecutive year and
continued our share repurchase program.”  Chevron rose 1.2 percent to $116.50 at the close in  New
York .  Field Swap  Results from oil and gas production included a gain from
the exchange of a stake in the Browse gas fields in  Australia 
for  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s interests in the Clio and Acme
fields. The swap agreement also included a $450 million cash
payment to Chevron. The gain contributed about $1.4 billion, or
72 cents a share, to profit, based on Bloomberg calculations.  The company’s refining and marketing business reported a
$925 million profit after posting a $61 million loss during the
final three months of 2011.  Oil and gas production rose 1 percent to the equivalent of
2.67 million barrels a day from 2.64 million a year earlier.
Crude output, which accounts for about two-thirds of Chevron’s
production, fell 1.2 percent to 1.8 million barrels a day from
1.82 million, the company said.  Chevron processed 1.62 million barrels of crude and other
feedstock a day at its plants around the world during the
October-to-December period, a 3.3 percent increase from 1.57
million a year earlier, according to the statement. Processing
rates at the company’s U.S. refineries dropped 8 percent to
702,000 barrels a day from 763,000 a year earlier due to the
lingering impact of an August fire that shut a crude unit at a
California facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
