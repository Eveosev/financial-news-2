U.K. prosecutors won’t file charges
against two Australian disc jockeys over hoax calls involving
the Duchess of Cambridge while she was in a London hospital.  A nurse, who had initially taken the call from the
pranksters, committed suicide after the incident. There is no
evidence to support manslaughter charges, said Malcolm McHaffie,
at the Crown Prosecution Service, in an e-mailed statement
today.  Radio hosts at  Southern Cross Media Group Ltd. (SXL) , Mel Greig
and Michael Christian, impersonated  Queen Elizabeth II  and
Prince Charles in the call seeking details about the health of
the former  Kate Middleton , the pregnant wife of Charles’s son
William, the second in line to the British throne.  “However misguided, the telephone call was intended as a
harmless prank,” McHaffie said. “The consequences in this case
were very sad.”  While there may be evidence to support violations of the
Data Protection Act, it wouldn’t be possible to extradite anyone
from Australia for those offenses, the CPS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
