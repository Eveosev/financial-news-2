U.S. stocks surged as growth in
American payrolls was enough to ease concern about the economy
without stoking speculation the Federal Reserve will hasten the
end of stimulus. Industrial metals led gains in commodities and
the yen weakened, while Treasuries reversed early gains.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 149.21 points to
14,009.79, climbing above 14,000 for the first time since 2007,
while the S&P 500  Index (IBEX)  jumped 1 percent to return to a five-
year high following a two-day retreat. The 10-year Treasury
yield rose four basis points to 2.02 percent. Spain’s IBEX 35
Index slid to a one-month low as regulators lifted a ban on
short selling, while  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index capped the
best week since October 2011 as manufacturing expanded. The yen
sank against all 16 major peers.  U.S. employers added 157,000 jobs in January and employment
growth accelerated more than previously estimated at the end
2012, Labor Department figures showed, while other reports on
 consumer confidence , manufacturing and construction spending
topped forecasts. The data eased concern about the world’s
largest economy following a report earlier this week that showed
gross domestic product shrank last quarter for the first time
since the recession.  “The most positive part of the headline was the
revisions,” said Liz Ann Sonders, the New York-based chief
investment strategist at Charles Schwab Corp., which has $1.95
trillion in client assets. “That’s particularly good because of
the negative 0.1 percent GDP report. The market is telling you
that the economy is not as bad as many people believe. The fact
the January was up very nicely typically bodes well for the rest
of the year.”  Payrolls Revision  The Labor Department revised earlier data to show a 196,000
increase in employment for December and a 247,000 surge in
November, adding a total of 127,000 to the count for those two
months. Labor also issued its annual benchmark update, which
aligns data spanning from April 2011 to March 2012 with
corporate tax records. The revision showed payrolls grew by an
additional 424,000 workers, on an unadjusted basis, in that
period. The jobless rate increased to 7.9 percent from 7.8
percent.  “The unemployment rate has increased primarily due to
individuals streaming back into the workforce, which is a sign
of growth in confidence in the economic expansion, and perhaps
the exhaustion of savings and employment benefits,” said  Joseph Brusuelas , senior economist at Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg
News. “While there are encouraging signs, caution is the proper
way for investors to proceed.”  Market Movers  Bank of America Corp., United Technologies Corp. and
Verizon Communications Inc. jumped more than 2 percent to lead
the Dow’s gain today.  All 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 advanced, with
financial, telephone and commodity companies climbing at least
1.2 percent to lead the rally. Tyson Foods Inc. gained 3.1
percent after profits topped forecasts. Zoetis Inc., the animal-
health company owned by Pfizer Inc., surged 19 percent in its
trading debut following an initial public offering. Merck & Co.
slipped 3.3 percent after forecasting a drop in profit this
year.  Exxon Mobil Corp. closed little changed after reporting
fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates. Earnings per
share beat the average analyst estimate at some 73 percent of
254 companies in the index that have released results so far in
the reporting season, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Economic Data  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
U.S. consumer sentiment for January rose to 73.8 from 72.9 at
the end of the previous month. Economists projected 71.5 for the
gauge after a preliminary January reading of 71.3, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The index averaged
64.2 during the last recession and 89 in the five years before
the 18-month economic slump that ended in June 2009.  The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index
climbed to 53.1 last month from December’s 50.2, exceeding the
highest estimate in a survey of 86 economists with a median
forecast of  50.7.  About $2.6 trillion was added to the value of equities
worldwide last month as earnings from companies including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. beat estimates and U.S. lawmakers
forged a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic
spending cuts and tax increases. Including dividends, the S&P
500 rallied 5.2 percent last month for its best January return
since 1997.  ‘Encouraging Sign’  Two-year Treasury yields erased an earlier drop to end
little changed at 0.26 percent, while 30-year rates rose six
basis points to 3.23 percent.  Bonds reversed gains after Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis President James Bullard, an advocate for slowing stimulus,
said U.S. job growth in the past three months has been “an
encouraging sign.” Bullard said he may urge cutting the pace of
central bank asset purchases by the middle of the year if growth
picks up as he expects.  “We should think about tapering or adjusting the
program,” Bullard said today in an interview in  Washington .
“If you get some good data for a couple of months,” then
policy makers might say, “OK, we go to $75 billion or something
like that,” he said, referring to monthly asset purchases that
currently run at $85 billion a month.  Commodity Movers  Seventeen of the 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI
Index increased, sending the gauge up 0.5 percent to the highest
level since September. Nickel, aluminum, copper and zinc added
more than 1.4 percent each. Oil rose 28 cents to settle at
$97.77 a barrel in New York to cap an eighth straight weekly
gain, the longest streak since 2004.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.3 percent, trimming
this week’s drop to 0.5 percent. The  gauge  climbed in January,
capping an eighth month of gains and the longest winning streak
since 1997.  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  rallied 6.5 percent as the U.K’s
largest Internet service provider reported profit that exceeded
analysts’ estimates. The regional benchmark pared gains earlier
while German two-year notes rose after the European Central Bank
said banks will repay 3.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) of its
emergency loans next week.  Spain’s IBEX 35 slipped 1.6 percent as the market
regulator, known as CNMV, allowed a ban on short-selling stocks
to expire yesterday. Banco Santander SA, Spain’s largest bank,
fell 2.3 percent and Fomento de Construcciones & Contratas SA
slid 9.1 percent.  Yen Weakens  The yen weakened for a third straight day against the
dollar, headed for a 12th consecutive weekly decline. It
depreciated as much as 1.2 percent to 92.80 per dollar, the
lowest level since June 2010.  Japan ’s jobless rate rose and
household spending declined, data showed today, underscoring the
case for further easing.  The euro strengthened against 12 of its 16 major peers,
climbing 0.6 percent to $1.3666. In addition to a report showing
manufacturing shrank less than forecast in the currency region,
other data showed the unemployment rate was 11.7 percent in
December, less than forecast.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  gained 0.4 percent. The
Shanghai Composite Index added 1.4 percent, climbing 5.6 percent
in the week, and  Brazil ’s Bovespa increased 1 percent to pare a
second straight weekly loss.  To contact the reporters on this story:
