Hong Kong  stocks  swung between gains
and losses after retail sales in the city rose more than
estimated and reports showed China’s manufacturing expanded.  China Resources Power Holdings Co. (HSI)  jumped 3.5 percent as
energy companies gained on speculation greater factory output
will mean more demand for electricity. Luk Fook Holdings
International Ltd. climbed 2.2 percent as a report showed Hong
Kong’s retail sales increased 8.8 percent in December. China
Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., the biggest mainland developer
listed in Hong Kong, fell 2.3 percent after home prices in China
posted their biggest gain in two years, sparking concern that
the government will introduce additional property curbs.  The Hang Seng Index was fell 0.2 percent to 23,673.33 at
3:14 p.m. after falling as much as 0.7 percent. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index climbed 0.3 percent to 12,163.22,
reversing an earlier loss of 1.2 percent after an official
purchasing managers’ index expanded less than economists had
forecast. That was countered by a separate survey from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics that showed an acceleration.  “Stocks went down at first on worse-than-expected official
PMI, then the investors start to ponder if it’s just a seasonal
effect,” Li Jun, a strategist at Central China Securities Co.,
said from Shanghai. “When HSBC PMI was better-than-expected,
the worry was removed, so stocks went up again. However in the
longer term, it’s harder for the stock market to continue this
rally because it’s already risen a lot and most reasons have
been priced in.”  China Recovery  The Hang Seng Index rallied the past five months, the
longest such streak since July 2009, after the U.S. Federal
Reserve embarked on a third round of quantitative easing in
September and on optimism China’s recovery will continue. Asia’s
biggest economy is expected to expand 7.5 percent to 9 percent
this year, a Bloomberg survey last week showed.  Trading volume on the Hang Seng Index was 0.3 percent below
the 30-day moving average at the time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shares on the gauge traded at 11.5 times
 estimated earnings , compared with 13.6 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
slipped 0.3 percent to 12,097.50. The official Purchasing
Managers’ Index, a gauge for manufacturing activity,
unexpectedly fell last month as export orders contracted and
production slowed, signaling a recovery in the world’s second-
biggest economy has yet to gain momentum.  China PMI  The reading was 50.4 in January, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
today in Beijing as they more than tripled the number of
companies surveyed to 3,000. That compares with a median
estimate of 51 in a Bloomberg News survey of 33 analysts and
50.6 in December. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.  A separate survey conducted by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics showed the January PMI rose to 52.3 from 51.5 in
December.  China Resources Power gained 3.5 percent to HK$22.20. China
Oil & Gas Group Ltd. rose 3.3 percent to HK$1.27. ENN Energy
Holdings Ltd. added 4 percent to HK$1.50.  Hong Kong’s December retail sales increased 8.8 percent
compared with an analyst estimate of 7.6 percent, according to a
report released yesterday.  Luk Fook gained 2.2 percent to HK$27.80. Cosmetic retailers
 L’Occitane International SA (973)  and Sa Sa International Holdings
Ltd., rose 3.7 percent to HK$24.15 and 1.6 percent to HK$7.11
respectively.  Developers Fall  Chinese developers dropped after China’s new home prices
rose 1 percent in January, according to SouFun Holdings Ltd.,
the country’s biggest real estate website owner. Rapid price
gains may spark concern about policy tightening, Alan Jin, a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., wrote in
an email.  China Overseas Land fell 2.3 percent to HK$23.40. China
Resources Land Ltd., a state-owned developer, decreased 2.1
percent to HK$23.10.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. (2777)  dropped 0.4
percent to HK$14.00.  To contact the reporters on this story:
