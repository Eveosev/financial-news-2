China , the world’s biggest consumer
of grain, is ready to boost imports when overseas supplies are
cheap, said  Chen Xiwen , deputy head of the Central Rural Work
Leading Group under the State Council.  “Importing products that China needs helps to stabilize
domestic prices” and benefits exporters, Chen said at a press
conference in Beijing today, referring to corn, rice and wheat.
The country should source from both domestic and overseas
markets to ensure supply, he said. He didn’t elaborate.  The world’s most-populous nation increased rice imports
fourfold while tripling corn  purchases  last year as rising costs
of domestic land and labor made foreign supplies cheaper.
China’s purchases, often timed during drops in global markets,
may steadily grow and support international prices, said Tommy
Xiao, analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co.  “Officials are now speaking in a more realistic fashion
that China needs the global market to balance its grain needs,”
Xiao said by phone from  Shanghai . “China’s needs and choices of
consumption will affect global agricultural production for years
to come,” he said.  China should diversify  purchases  of grain imports,
including soybeans and corn, to cut reliance on large producing
nations such as the U.S., Brazil and  Argentina , said Chen.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
