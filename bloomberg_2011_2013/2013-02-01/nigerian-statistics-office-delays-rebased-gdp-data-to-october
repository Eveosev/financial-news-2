The Nigerian statistics office
postponed the release of rebased gross domestic product figures
because more information needs to be gathered on some sectors,
the head of the agency said.  “There are two or three sectors that we need to get a bit
more information about to ensure the numbers are as credible as
possible,” Yemi Kale of the  National Bureau of Statistics  said
by phone yesterday from Abuja, the capital. Those include non-
profit organizations and the  mining industry , he said. About 70
percent of the work has been done, he said.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, is updating its GDP
base year to 2010 to give a better indication of the size of the
economy. The West African country’s GDP is currently based on
spending patterns in 1990. The updated data, which are now set
to be released  Oct. 24 , will probably boost the size of the
Nigerian economy, according to the statistics bureau.  The statistics office has postponed the release of the data
at least twice before, citing funding constraints. It was
expected to be ready in the first quarter of this year, Kale
said on Nov. 20.  Nigeria’s economy, estimated by the  International Monetary
Fund  at  $272.6 billion  last year, is forecast to expand 6.5
percent this year, according to the national budget presented by
President Goodluck Jonathan to lawmakers on Oct. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
