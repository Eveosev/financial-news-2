Akfen Holding AS (AKFEN)  jumped the most in
20 months, rebounding after a selloff caused by the Turkish
builder’s elimination from a natural gas grid auction.  The stock  climbed  8.8 percent to 11.1 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the biggest leap since May 2011. The number of shares
traded was more than 2 1/2 times the stock’s three-month daily
average volume. Akfen slumped 13 percent over the two days to
Jan. 28.  The company was eliminated in the Jan. 25 auction of
Baskent Dogalgaz Dagitim, Ankara’s natural gas grid.  “The stock was seriously punished, and is now being
forgiven,” Sezai Saklaroglu, an analyst at Istanbul-based Erste
Securities, said in a phone interview today. “There was nothing
to necessitate that sharp decline.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
