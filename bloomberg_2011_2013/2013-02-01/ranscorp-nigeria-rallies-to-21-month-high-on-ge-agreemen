Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc ,
which invests in hotels, agriculture and energy, rose to the
highest in 21 months after signing a deal with  General Electric
Co. (GE)  for equity investment and technical support.  The stock gained 10 percent to close at 1.43 naira in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, the highest since April
2011. More than 50 million shares were on full bid, David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth Trust and Investment
Co., said before the close by phone from Lagos.  GE will invest $1 billion in Nigeria over the next five
years by building a manufacturing plant to support power
generation and oil production, Chairman  Jeffrey Immelt  said
yesterday. Transcorp said Jan. 30 it signed an agreement with GE
for the provision of technical support and equity investment in
Transcorp Ughelli Power Plc.  “Investors believe the global pedigree of GE will enable
Transcorp to maximize revenue from the huge potential of the
power sector,” Adonri said.  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous country of more
than 160 million people is seeking increased investments in
power to meet demand that’s more than double the current output
of about 4,000 megawatts. The government has ended state
monopoly of power utilities and sold generation and distribution
companies to private investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
