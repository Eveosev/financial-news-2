The  European Central Bank  said banks
will repay 3.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) of its emergency
three-year loans next week.  A total of 27 financial institutions will use the second
opportunity for early repayment of the initial three-year loan,
the Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. Banks already
returned 137.2 billion euros of long-term funds this week. The
ECB’s first loan totaled 489 billion euros and banks can make
early repayments on a weekly basis.  While the ECB doesn’t provide a breakdown of the
institutions returning the loans, some banks have indicated that
they’re handing money back. Commerzbank AG,  Germany ’s second-
biggest lender, said it repaid 10 billion euros and  Banco
Popular Espanol (POP)  said it gave back 1.3 billion euros.  Early repayment of the loans is “a positive signal,” ECB
council member  Ewald Nowotny  said last month.  The ECB provided the two tranches of so-called Longer Term
Refinancing Operations a year ago after banks stopped lending to
each other. Banks have the option of repaying the loans, which
were offered at the average of the ECB’s benchmark rate over
their duration, after a year.  Economists expected a total of 150 billion euros in early
repayment for the first and 139 billion euros for the second
tranche, according to a Bloomberg News survey. The first
opportunity for banks to repay money from the second tranche,
which amounted to 529 billion euros, is Feb. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
