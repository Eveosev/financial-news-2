  Suez Environnement (SEV) ,  Europe ’s largest
water company, won an 8-year contract from Durham County Council
in northeastern England that’s worth at least 130 million euros
($177 million).  The Paris-based utility said today in a statement that the
contract to manage 140,000 tons of household waste a year “will
be put to good use” at SITA UK’s energy-from-waste facility in
Teesside that’s under construction. Residual waste currently
going to landfills “will generate enough electricity to power
17,000 homes,” Suez said.  The company said it supplies drinking water to 97 million
people, provides wastewater treatment services for 66 million
and collects waste produced by 57 million people on five
continents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
