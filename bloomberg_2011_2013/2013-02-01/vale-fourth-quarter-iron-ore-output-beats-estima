Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s third-largest
mining company, posted better-than-expected fourth quarter iron-
ore output because of less rain in Brazil as the company seeks
to recover market share from its Australian rivals. Shares
gained.  Total output rose 3.1 percent to 85.5 million metric tons
from 82.9 million tons a year earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based
company said in a  statement  today. That exceeded the 83.4
million-ton average of six analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Melbourne-based  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company,  boosted  its quarterly iron-ore output 3
percent while Rio Tinto Group’s gained 1.6 percent.  Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, is struggling
to boost production of the key steelmaking ingredient amid
declining resources at older mines. The company is slashing
investments, seeking partners for its lower-return projects and
selling assets after  shares  slumped to the lowest in almost
three years in September amid weaker demand from China and
Europe.  The quarterly output increase reflects “below normal”
rainfall in Brazil and better productivity at one of its mines
in Carajas, the world’s largest iron-ore complex, Vale said.  “This was the first time since 2003 that the performance
in a fourth quarter was better than in third quarter,” the
company said in today’s filing. “Rainfall in Carajas fell to
its lowest level for a fourth quarter since 2008.”  Price Rally  Vale  rose  1.3 percent to 39.20 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo today, the highest since Jan. 23. The stock has  dropped 
4.1 percent during 2013.  “We highlight the performance of iron-ore production from
Carajas,” Brasil Plural CCTVM analysts led by Renato Antunes
said in a note to clients today. “The Carajas-effect may start
to materialize during 2013, as a result of the ramp-up of new
mining pits.”  The higher quarterly iron-ore output allowed Vale to
benefit from a recent rally in prices for the steelmaking raw
material, the company said today, without providing details.
Vale is scheduled to report annual financial results on Feb. 27.  Iron-ore prices have recovered 77 percent following a
three-year low in September to reach a 15-month high on Jan. 8,
as growth in China, the biggest metals consumer, accelerates.
Ore with 62 iron percent content delivered to the Chinese port
of Tianjin  rose  0.5 percent to $153.2 a ton today, according to
a price index compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  Vale’s nickel production dropped 6.6 percent in the quarter
to 64,000 tons, beating a 62,700-ton average forecast by six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Copper output declined 4.6
percent in past quarter to 81,000 tons, the company said. Total
coal output increased 21 percent to 1.95 million tons while
potash fell 11 percent to 161,000 tons.  Slowing Output  Production at Carajas, in Brazil’s north, slid 0.5 percent
in the quarter, while output of pellets, a processed form of
iron ore used by the steel industry, declined 2.1 percent to
12.1 million tons as the company slows down activity at its
pellet plants.  Vale’s iron-ore production for 2012 fell 0.8 percent to 320
million tons, its first annual decline in three years, after
heavy rain in Brazil in the first quarter delayed output. The
company boosted production 5.5 percent since 2007,
underperforming the 37 percent increase by London-based Rio
Tinto, the world’s second-largest iron ore producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
