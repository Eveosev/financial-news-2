U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron
will host a security summit between the leaders of Afghanistan
and  Pakistan  at his country retreat outside  London  this weekend,
trying to encourage greater cooperation.  Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Afghan President
Hamid Karzai will join Cameron at the house, known as Chequers,
for dinner tomorrow evening and then hold talks the following
morning, the premierâ€™s office said. It will be the third time
the pair have met to discuss security cooperation since July.  Cameron, who was in Kabul at that time, suggested then that
he facilitate meetings to encourage the signing of a security
deal along the lines of those Afghanistan has already reached
with countries including the U.K. and the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
