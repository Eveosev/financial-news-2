India ’s rupee headed for a fourth
weekly gain on optimism capital inflows will quicken after the
central bank cut  interest rates  for the first time since April
to support the economy.  The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered its benchmark repurchase
rate to 7.75 percent from 8 percent on Jan. 29 and said cooling
inflation will give some room to ease policy further. Global
funds poured $571 million into Indian shares in the first three
days of this week, exchange data show. The rupee also gained as
exporters repatriated overseas earnings, according to  FirstRand
Ltd. (FSR) , taking advantage of a more favorable exchange rate after
the local currency lost 7.6 percent in the past year.  “Inflows and the rupee’s gains are sentiment-driven after
the recent policy actions,” said Harihar Krishnamoorthy,
Mumbai-based treasurer at the Indian unit of FirstRand.
“Current levels are appropriate for the currency and will also
be supportive for exporters.”  The rupee advanced 0.7 percent this week to 53.2975 per
dollar as of 10:27 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It fell 0.1 percent today. The currency, which rose
3.3 percent last month in the best rally since September,
touched 53.0650 yesterday, the strongest level since Oct. 18.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this week
to 9.84 percent. The rate rose two basis points today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.30 per
dollar, compared with 54.21 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.13 versus 53.98. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
