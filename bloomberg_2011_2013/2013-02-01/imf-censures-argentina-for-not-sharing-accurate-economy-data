The International Monetary Fund said
it censured  Argentina  for not providing accurate data on
inflation and economic growth under a procedure that can end in
expulsion.  The declaration of censure was adopted today by the IMF’s
board of 24 directors, the Washington-based fund said in a
statement. While it doesn’t have immediate effects, the decision
takes the country a step closer to sanctions that include being
barred access to IMF loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
