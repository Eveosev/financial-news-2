Kirin Holdings Co. (2503) ,  Japan ’s largest
beverage company, agreed to sell its 15 percent stake in  Fraser
& Neave Ltd. (FNN)  to Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi for S$2 billion ($1.6
billion), strengthening the Thai billionaire’s control.  Kirin will book a 47 billion yen ($510 million) gain before
taxes for the year ending December 2013 on the sale to be
completed Feb. 14, the Tokyo-based company said yesterday in a
statement.  Charoen’s TCC Assets accumulated a majority stake in F&N
this week after raising its offer on Jan. 18 to value the 130-
year-old property and beverage company at S$13.8 billion. Kirin
joined  Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd. (OUE) , a Singapore-based
property company, in a November bid for F&N under a plan for
Kirin to take F&N’s food and beverage unit if the OUE group’s
bid had succeeded.  “Kirin will need to reconsider its Southeast Asia
strategy,” said Mikihiko Yamato, deputy head of research for JI
Asia in  Tokyo . “If Kirin joined the OUE bid with the intention
of selling the stake in the first place, it was an excellent
strategy.”  The company plans to maintain its beverage business
strategy in the region through its  Singapore  affiliate and group
companies including  Interfood Shareholding Co. (IFS)  in  Vietnam  and
Siam Kirin Beverage Co. in  Thailand , it said in today’s
statement.  Kirin rose 2.7 percent to 1,172 yen at the close in Tokyo
trading yesterday. The shares have advanced 28 percent over the
past 12 months, compared with a 24 percent gain for the broader
Topix index.  Charoen gained the upper hand in the F&N takeover battle
after OUE failed to match his S$9.55 a share offer. He had
offered $S8.88 a share in September, after sparking the battle
by agreeing to buy a 22 percent stake in F&N in July.  Kirin and Japanese competitors  Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501)  and
 Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502)  are buying beverage-maker stakes
overseas as beer demand slumps at home. Kirin bought the F&N
stake from Singapore’s Temasek Holdings in 2010 for S$1.3
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
