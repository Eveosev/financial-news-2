Peruvian bonds gained, pushing down
yields the most in three weeks, as investors took advantage of a
decline in the sol to buy debt at cheaper dollar-based prices.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bonds due August 2020 dropped seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 3.77 percent at 11:42 a.m. in  Lima ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds’ price
climbed 0.51 centimo to 126.30 centimos per sol.  The sol closed at a seven-week low yesterday after the
 Finance Ministry  pledged to buy $4 billion in the foreign-
exchange market and the central bank raised  reserve requirements 
to help stem the currency’s appreciation. The weaker sol makes
it cheaper for foreign investors to purchase Peruvian bonds
while a drop in implied yields on sol forwards has cut the cost
of hedging  currency risk , said Diego Llona, a bond trader at
Banco Santander Peru SA.  “Right now the hedge is a bargain,” Llona said in an e-
mailed message.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.5725 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. It closed at 2.5755
yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 11.  One-month implied yield on sol forwards, a measure of the
costs to hedge, fell to -4.93 percent on Jan. 22, the lowest
since August 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yield was -1.41 percent today.  The implied yield is derived from the difference between
the spot and forward price and compares with the central bank’s
benchmark interest rate of 4.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
