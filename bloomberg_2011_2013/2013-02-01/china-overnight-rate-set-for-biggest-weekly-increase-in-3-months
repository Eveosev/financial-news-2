China ’s overnight money-market rate
climbed the most since October this week on speculation cash at
banks will drop as customer withdrawals increase before the
weeklong Lunar New Year holiday starting Feb. 11.  The one-day repurchase  rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, jumped the most this month today even after the
central bank  added  money into the financial system to help ease
the fund squeeze. The People’s Bank of China pumped in 59
billion  yuan  ($9.5 billion) this week, the first injection in
2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “If the central bank doesn’t inject more capital,
liquidity will become tighter next week,” said Song Qiuhong, a
bond analyst at Foshan Shunde Rural Commercial Bank Co. in
Foshan, a city in the southern province of Guangdong.  The one-day repo rate climbed 55 basis points, or 0.55
percentage point, this week to 2.66 percent as of 10:07 a.m. in
 Shanghai , the biggest increase since the five days ended Oct.
26, according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It’s surged 34 basis points today.  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost needed to receive
the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis point
today and this week to 3.18 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.15 percent government bond due January
2018 increased two basis points this week to 3.26 percent,
according to the Interbank Funding Center. It decreased one
basis point today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
