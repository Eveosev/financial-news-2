Heating oil rose for a fifth
consecutive day as stronger  Brent crude  increased output costs
for refiners using oil priced off the London benchmark and as
gasoil in  Europe  advanced.  Futures advanced as Brent oil on ICE Futures Europe
exchange broke above $116 a barrel and its premium to West Texas
Intermediate crude widened $1.15 to $19.21 a barrel on the
Nymex. Gasoil climbed above $1,000 a metric ton in Europe.  “We’re back to refined products following Brent and
ignoring WTI,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the
Energy Management Institute in  New York .  Heating oil for March delivery rose 2.86 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.1473 a gallon at 10:09 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 18 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day.  Prices are heading for a 3 percent gain this week, after
climbing 2.8 percent in January, the largest increase since
August.  The March gasoil contract added $9.50 to $992.25 a metric
ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London , while the
February contract touched $1004.50. Heating oil’s discount to
gasoil, based on balance-month Nymex and ICE calendar swaps,
increased 0.29 cent to 3.64 cents a gallon, Bloomberg fair-value
data show.  Gasoline fluctuated on speculation that near-term supply in
New York Harbor is sufficient, even as refinery maintenance and
the planned closing of a plant may curtail production.  Trainer Refinery  Delta Air Lines Inc.’s Monroe Energy LLC subsidiary on
expects to restart the fluid catalytic cracker next week at its
Trainer refinery in  Pennsylvania , Trebor Banstetter, a spokesman
for Delta in Atlanta, said in an e-mail.  “Gasoline is under a little bit of pressure with the
expectation of the Trainer cat cracker coming back next week,
which increases supply in the Northeast,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for March delivery gained 0.5 cent to $3.0367 a
gallon on volume that was 20 percent above the 100-day average
for the time of day. The discount of March to April futures
expanded 0.8 cent to 15.72 cents a gallon.  Prices are heading for a 5.6 percent increase this week.
Futures climbed 7.6 percent in January, the second-best
performer on the Standard & Poor’s  GSCI commodity index , after
cotton.  The  retail  price for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 3.9 cents to $3.462 a gallon, the highest level since Nov.
7, AAA said today on its website. That’s the largest one-day
increase since Aug. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
