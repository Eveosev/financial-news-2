Cavium Inc. (CAVM) , a maker of chips for
communications and security applications, rose the most in three
months after fourth-quarter profit and sales  beat  analyst
estimates.  Cavium advanced 6 percent to $35.46 at the close in New
York for its biggest gain since Oct. 31. The stock has climbed
10 percent over the past 12 months,  compared  with a 6.7 percent
gain in the Russell 2000 Technology Index.  As companies collect and analyze more data to run their
businesses, equipment manufacturers are building systems that
remotely handle computing tasks and deliver information
securely, requiring speedy chips that can handle jobs with
built-in software. San Jose, California-based Cavium sold more
of such semiconductors to  Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW)  and  Citrix
Systems Inc. (CTXS) , making up for fewer orders from  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) 
according to Alex Gauna, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC.  “You’re seeing somewhat of a relief rally,” Gauna said in
an interview. “It now has a more broad, diversified customer
base.”  Gauna rates Cavium the equivalent of a buy at market
outperform, with a target of $38.  Fourth-quarter profit, excluding some costs, was 20 cents a
share, the company said in a statement yesterday. That compares
with an average analyst  estimate  of 17 cents. Revenue rose 18
percent to $66.4 million, while analysts had projected $66.1
million.  Cavium’s multicore processor will help drive sales in the
future, Gauna said, as the cloud-computing industry grows.  “That’s where the market is going,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
