Water service in  Brisbane ,
Australia’s third-most populous city, returned to normal today
after floods muddied reserves and forced officials to shut the
region’s main treatment plant.  Average daily residential water consumption across
southeastern Queensland state in the two weeks ended Jan. 30 was
184 liters (40 gallons) per person, less than the 217 liters in
the 14-day period ended Jan. 23, according to Seqwater, the
state authority responsible for ensuring safe supplies.  The Mount Crosby Water Treatment Plant, supplier of most of
the drinking water to Brisbane, Ipswich and Logan, was off-line
Jan. 29 because of “record turbidity levels.” About 2.15
million people reside in the metropolitan Brisbane area.  The late-January deluge that inundated thousands of homes
and caused the evacuation of some 7,500 people in the Queensland
town of Bundaberg followed higher-than-average temperatures
across much of the country earlier in the month.  Australia  recorded its hottest month on record in January,
with an average mean temperature of 29.7 degrees Celsius (85.5
degrees Fahrenheit) that surpassed a previous record set in
1932, the bureau of meteorology said in a statement today. “The
heat wave in the first half of January was exceptional in its
extent and duration,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
