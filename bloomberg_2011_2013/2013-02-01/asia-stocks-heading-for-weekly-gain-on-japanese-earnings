Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index retreating a second day from the highest since
August 2011, after mixed reports on Chinese manufacturing.
Japanese shares advanced on earnings and a weaker yen.  China Overseas Land (688)  & Investment Ltd., the biggest mainland

curbs.  NEC Corp. (6701)  surged 8.5 percent after the maker of

strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which has 33
trillion yen ($359 billion) in assets. “The real economy isn’t
catching up, and people may be expecting more easing. In  Japan ,
optimism about the nation’s new government is having a stronger
impact than corporate earnings.”  The regional benchmark yesterday capped a three-month

above the 30-day intraday average, according to data compiled by

in January, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
