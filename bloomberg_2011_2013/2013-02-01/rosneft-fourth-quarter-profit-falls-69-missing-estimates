OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, said fourth-quarter earnings fell 69 percent following
a charge related to unproven reserves.  Net income declined to 57 billion rubles ($1.9 billion)
from 181 billion rubles in the third quarter, the Moscow-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. That missed the 77.2
billion-ruble average adjusted forecast from 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Rosneft will become the world’s largest publicly traded
crude oil producer after a $55 billion deal to buy Russia’s
third-largest  oil company , TNK-BP, which is expected to close in
the first half. Rosneft is the first Russian oil company to
report earnings for the fourth quarter.  “The miss was mostly due to higher costs including
operating expenses,” Ildar Davletshin, an oil and gas analyst
at  Renaissance Capital , said by e-mail from Moscow.  The shares fell 1.3 percent to 262.89 rubles as of 5:30
p.m. in Moscow.  Profit fell as a result of an impairment of unproved
reserves and lower foreign exchange gain than the previous
quarter. Earnings in the previous three months were also buoyed
by a gain on the acquisition of gas company OOO Itera.  Revenue fell 2.3 percent to 790 billion rubles from the
third quarter because of a deterioration in product markets and
lower sales, Rosneft said.  Oil and gas production rose 3.4 percent to 2.82 million
barrels a day, according to the statement.  Net debt rose to 581 billion rubles last year, Rosneft
said.  Rosneft said it’s been granted 12 offshore licenses by the
Russian government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
