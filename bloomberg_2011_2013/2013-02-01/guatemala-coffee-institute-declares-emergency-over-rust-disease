The Guatemalan National Coffee
Association declared a state of emergency due to the spread of
rust disease, which will generate losses of as much as 40
percent of the 2013-2014 national harvest, association President
Nils Leporowski said.  Leaf rust, also called roya, will result in losses of 15
percent of the 2012-2013 national harvest, Leporowski said in a
telephone interview. A state of emergency was declared today by
the Guatemalan National Coffee Association, known as Anacafe,
which is working with the government to create a strategy to
combat the fungus, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
