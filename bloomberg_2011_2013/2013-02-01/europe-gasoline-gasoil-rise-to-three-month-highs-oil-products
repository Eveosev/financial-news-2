European gasoline barges rose for a
12th day to the highest level in more than three months. Gasoil
futures advanced to the highest since October.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will permanently halt gasoline and
diesel production at its Hamburg oil refinery in  Germany  at the
end of March as the company converts part of the site into
storage facilities. OAO Lukoil extinguished a fire at its
Ploiesti refinery in  Romania .  Light Products  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub traded
from $1,073 to $1,076 a ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That’s
the highest since Oct. 11 and compares with deals from $1,056 to
$1,062 yesterday. The product advanced 12 percent last month.  Gunvor Group Ltd. Vitol Group and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  sold the
Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added before being sold at
the pump. Lukoil’s Litasco unit, Argos Groep BV and Trafigura
Beheer BV bought barges, which typically comprise 1,000 and
2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , rose 24 cents
to $13.54 a barrel as of 10:44 a.m. local time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. That’s down from
$13.92 on Jan. 30, the most in four months.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent crude, widened to
$8.31 a barrel, PVM data showed. That’s the biggest loss in
three weeks.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil rose to more than $1,000 a ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London for the first time since October,
extending a 7.1 percent advance last month.  Futures for February delivery gained as much as $8.75, or
0.9 percent, to $1,001.75 a ton, the highest since Oct. 19. The
contract was at $999.25 a ton at 1:48 p.m.  London  time.  The contract’s premium, or backwardation, to March futures
was at $10.25 a ton. That’s unchanged from the spread yesterday
and on Jan. 30, which was the widest gap since Oct. 30. The
market structure may signal falling near-term supply or rising
demand.  Gasoil’s  crack  fell to $16.62 versus $16.76 as of 4:30 p.m.
yesterday. Brent rose 52 cents to $116.07 a barrel.  Refineries  Shell will decommission one of the crude oil distillation
units and the catalytic cracker at its Hamburg refinery,
Cornelia Wolber, a Shell spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail.
Catalytic crackers are used in gasoline production.  The fire at Lukoil’s 48,000 barrel-a-day Ploiesti plant
occurred in a delayed coker unit which was scheduled to undergo
maintenance in a few days, according to a company spokesman who
asked not to be identified, citing company policy. No other
operations were affected, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
