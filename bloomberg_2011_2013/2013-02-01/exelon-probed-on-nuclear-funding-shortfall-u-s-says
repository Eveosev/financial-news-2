Exelon Corp. (EXC) , the largest U.S.
nuclear operator, “deliberately” under-reported for four years
the amount of money needed to retire its reactors, the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Exelon, based in  Chicago , faces “escalated enforcement
action” for the financial reporting errors that may total as
much $140,000 for each day of the violation, Scott Burnell, a
spokesman for the regulatory agency, said in a phone interview
today. The agency asked Exelon to explain the errors for the
years 2005-2007 and 2009 in a Jan. 31 letter.  The investigation is “very unusual” and may be the first
related to contributions to a federal nuclear decommissioning
trust fund, Anneliese Simmons, a financial analyst with the
commission’s Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, said in a
phone interview. The shortfall totaled $1 billion in 2009. The
company is now in compliance, Simmons said.  Exelon “disputes” the commission’s findings and is
conducting its own investigation of the matter, David Tillman, a
spokesman for Exelon’s power generation unit, said in an e-mail.  “We are not aware of any evidence supporting a conclusion
that Exelon employees performed or condoned deliberate
misconduct or intentionally violated regulatory requirements,”
Tillman said.  Exelon fell 1.3 percent to $31.03 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
