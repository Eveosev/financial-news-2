German power for 2014 fell to a
record as European emission permits dropped for a fourth day.  German electricity for 2014, a European benchmark, lost as
much as 0.4 percent, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg, as European emission allowances for December dropped
3.5 percent on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Baseload power, for delivery around the clock, declined 15
cents to 40.25 euros ($54.80) a megawatt-hour before trading
unchanged at 10:02 a.m. Berlin time. European emission permits
for delivery in December slid as much as 12 cents to 3.30 euros
a metric ton. Power can track emission prices that influence
electricity production costs.  “We continue to believe that absent regulatory
intervention, the improved liquidity in the carbon market since
Jan. 1 will quickly, within a few months, drive the carbon price
towards potentially below 1 euro a ton”, Per Lekander, a Paris-
based analyst at  UBS AG (UBSN) , said in an e-mailed note.  German baseload power for delivery in March dropped as much
as 1.3 percent to 38.50 euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest price
since Bloomberg started compiling the data in October.  Available generation capacity in  Germany  is set to rise to
64,105 megawatts on Feb. 4 from 62,000 megawatts today,
according to data on the  European Energy Exchange AG  website. In
 France , nuclear output is set to climb to 58,000 megawatts from
57,587 megawatts tomorrow, data from  Reseau de Transport
d’Electricite  show. EDF started its 910-megawatt Blayais-4
reactor after an unplanned halt on Jan. 30, according to RTE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
