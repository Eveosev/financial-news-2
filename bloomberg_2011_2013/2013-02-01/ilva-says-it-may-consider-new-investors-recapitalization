Gruppo Riva may seek new investors
and raise capital at its Ilva steel plant, which was partially
shut by prosecutors probing environmental violations, Chairman
Bruno Ferrante said.  Ferrante, who met with government officials last night,
said in an e-mailed statement that the company is “working on a
financial-sustainability plan” that would allow it to carry out
environmental improvements at the site. To implement the plan,
Ilva needs “a certain regulatory framework,” which is
currently unclear due to the action of the judiciary, Ferrante
said.  Prosecutors in July ordered the seizure of about $2 billion
of Ilva assets and demanded the arrest of some top executives on
suspicion they knowingly neglected environmental controls at the
plant in Taranto,  Italy , contributing to high cancer rates in
the area. Milan-based Riva denies responsibility for health
issues in the region. Ferrante asked prosecutors last month to
release the steel stocks so the company can pay workers and make
environmental improvements.  Ferrante said in yesterday’s statement the company has the
resources to pay January wages. Previously Ilva officials had
said it could pay salaries only if assets were released. The
company is set to meet labor unions in Taranto today.  Ilva accounts for 30 percent of Italy’s steel production
and about 12,000 jobs in a city where unemployment tops 30
percent. Ilva generates 75 percent of the province of Taranto’s
gross domestic product, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
