     Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) --Energia Sustentavel do Brasil, a
partnership between  GDF Suez (GSZ)  and subsidiaries of  Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) , received regulator approval to begin
operations at its Jirau hydro dam on March 1.  The dam was previously expected to begin operations on Jan.
1, Nelson Hubner, the head of the electricity regulator known as
Aneel, said in Brasilia today.  The 3.750 megawatt dam in northern Brazil is expected to
begin generating energy in May, when transmission lines connect
the dam to the nation’s grid. Jirau is expected to be fully
operational by June 2015, according to the calendar approved
today by Aneel.   To contact the reporter on this story:
