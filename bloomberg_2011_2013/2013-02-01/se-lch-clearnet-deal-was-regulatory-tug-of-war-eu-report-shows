London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) ’s
takeover bid for LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. was at the center of a
tug-of-war between European antitrust regulators last year with
the U.K. successfully fending off French requests for a European
Union review.  The U.K.’s  Office of Fair Trading  opposed requests by
France, Spain and  Portugal  for an EU merger investigation into
the deal, the European Commission said in a  document  published
on its website today. The Brussels-based EU authority said it
ruled out taking on the deal because of the U.K. stance and the
advanced stage of talks between British regulators and the
companies.  LSE, operator of  Europe ’s oldest independent stock
exchange, in December won U.K. antitrust approval to buy a stake
in the region’s biggest clearinghouse. LSE originally offered 20
euros a share for as much as 60 percent of LCH.Clearnet, valuing
the clearinghouse at 813 million euros ($1.1 billion). It cut
that bid to 15 euros a share amid concern European regulations
will force LCH.Clearnet to boost capital by 300 million euros to
375 million euros.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. said earlier this week that
it wanted the EU to take charge of its bid for NYSE Euronext to
avoid multiple probes across the 27-nation bloc.  While ICE must formally ask U.K., Spanish and Portuguese
regulators for permission to buy NYSE Euronext for cash and
stock worth $8.2 billion, it said it will ask for the EU to rule
on the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
