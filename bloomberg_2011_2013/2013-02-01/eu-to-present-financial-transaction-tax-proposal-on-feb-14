The European Commission will present
plans on Feb. 14 for a financial-transaction tax to be applied
by a group of interested member states.  The initiative will be based on a prior transaction-tax
proposal for all 27 EU nations that failed to gain support, the
Brussels-based commission said in a statement on its  website. 
The proposal must be agreed on by participating governments
before it can take effect.  The objectives of the tax are to “deliver important new
revenues, ensure a fair contribution from the financial sector
to public finances, contribute to more responsible trading and
enable a coherent approach to taxing this sector in the single
market,” the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
