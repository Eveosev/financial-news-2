The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission should urge the creation of a new stock exchange
limited to small companies that have trouble raising capital in
public markets, an agency panel recommended today.  The SEC Advisory Group on Small and Emerging Companies made
the recommendation as its co-chairman suggested that a 2012 law
intended to increase the number of initial public offerings
might fail to have a big impact. The so-called Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act designed to induce more IPOs by reducing
disclosure requirements and restrictions on how firms can
advertise for investors.  “The JOBS Act, at least in my view, definitely did not do
enough,” said Stephen M. Graham, the advisory group’s co-
chairman and a partner who has represented emerging companies at
Fenwick & West LLP in  Seattle . “The main reason why companies
don’t want to go public is liquidity in the stock,” as well as
disclosure requirements.  The advisory group said the exchange should be limited to
sophisticated investors, which it didn’t define, because
disclosure of the smaller companies’ financial condition would
be limited. The SEC isn’t required to hew to the advisory
group’s recommendations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
