Investors poured a record $927
million into U.S. loan funds this week, according to  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)   Deposits into mutual funds targeting floating-rate debt
increased $3.3 billion, or 4.4 percent, last month which is the
most of all other asset classes in percentage terms, the
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank said in the report.  Loans  returned  10.5 percent last year while speculative-
grade bonds gained 15.6 percent, according to Standard &
Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 and Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. This is the 33rd straight week of money
flowing into loan funds as investors seek shelter from a
possible increase in interest rates, according to Bank of
America.  Leveraged loans are those rated below BBB- by Standard &
Poor’s and less than Baa3 at Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
