BP Plc bought a cargo of Russian
Urals crude at a larger discount than the previous deal. There
were no bids or offers for  North Sea  grades.  Six Angolan crude cargoes for loading in March, about 11
percent of scheduled volumes, still haven’t been sold, five
traders who participate in the market said, adding that that’s
fewer than normal at this stage of the month.  North Sea  There were no bids or offers for North Sea grades for the
first time since Jan. 19,  a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.  A third Forties crude cargo has been added to the February
program, bringing the total for this month to 20, two people
with knowledge of the shipping schedule said.  Forties consignment F0222 will load on Feb. 26 to Feb. 28,
the people said, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell 7 cents to 58 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for March settlement traded at $116.84 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $115.20 in the previous session. The April
contract was at $115.87, a discount of 97 cents to March.  Mediterranean/Urals  Gunvor Group Ltd. sold the 100,000 metric-ton cargo of
Urals grade to BP for loading Feb. 13 to Feb. 17 at $1.55 less
than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the Platts
survey showed. That compares with a Jan. 25 deal at a 90 cent
discount, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In the Mediterranean, OAO Lukoil’s Litasco offered 140,000
tons of Urals at $1 less than Dated Brent on a delivered basis
to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed.  Socar Trading SA failed to find a buyer for 600,000 barrels
of Azeri Light for loading Feb. 11 to Feb. 15 at a $3.10 premium
to the benchmark, according to the survey.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 10 cents a barrel to 35 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at
96 cents, compared with 86 cents yesterday, the data show.  Crude exports from Caspian Pipeline Group via Novorossiysk
fell by 4.3 percent to 19.604 million barrels in January versus
20.482 million barrels a year earlier, the company said today on
its website.  OAO Rosneft agreed a deal with PKN Orlen SA to supply 6
million tons of oil a year, according to a company statement.
The deal runs through January 2016.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell 4 cents to $2.33 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show.  Unsold Angolan grades for export next month include two
shipments of Kissanje and one each of Cabinda, Girassol, Kuito
and Nemba, the people said, asking not to be identified because
the information is confidential. The size of the lots ranges
from 920,000 barrels to 1 million barrels. Five February cargoes
hadn’t been sold as of Jan. 9, three traders said at the time.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, issued a
tender to buy crude for April loading, a document obtained by
 Bloomberg News  shows.  The tender, which was released today, closes at 3 p.m.
local time on Feb. 6 with offers valid until 5 p.m. the next
day, according to the document. The company seeks crude from
West Africa among other locations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
