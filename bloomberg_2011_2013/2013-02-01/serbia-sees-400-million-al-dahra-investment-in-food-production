Serbia  and Abu Dhabi-based Al Dahra
Agricultural Co. will form a company next month that will invest
about 300 million euros ($409 Million) in producing, processing
and exporting food from the Balkan country.  Serbia and the  United Arab Emirates  will first sign a
bilateral framework agreement this month, the government said in
an e-mailed statement, after Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  met
in Belgrade with Khadim Abdulla Aldarei, a vice-chairman of Al
Dahra Holding LLC.  The joint venture, 80 percent-owned by Al Dahra, may take
over several state-owned agriculture companies in Serbia to help
expand irrigation and boost farm output, according to the
statement. Further financing, including loans for individual
farmers may be arranged with the  Abu Dhabi Fund for Development,
 whose officials are expected for talks in Belgrade next week,
the ministry said.  Al Dahra may also invest in Pancevo river port near the
Serbian capital, in five food processing plants and 40 million
euros in Jugoslovensko Recno Brodarstvo AD, a Belgrade-based
river shipper, the government said. The Abu Dhabi-based Royal
Group is expected to open a bank in the capital Belgrade in
several months, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
