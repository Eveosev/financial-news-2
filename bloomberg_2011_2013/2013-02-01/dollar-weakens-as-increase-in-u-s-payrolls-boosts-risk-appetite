The dollar fell to the lowest versus
the euro since November 2011 as a strengthening U.S. jobs market
and expectations the  Federal Reserve  will sustain stimulus to
ensure the recovery boosted investors’ risk appetite.  The shared currency rose against most major peers as
separate data showed European manufacturing at its highest level
in almost a year. The yen sank to a 2 1/2-year low amid bets
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will pick a new central-bank
governor who will boost stimulus.  “The jobs report hit the sweet spot of not being too
strong and not being too weak,”  Nick Bennenbroek , head of
currency strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co . in  New York , said in a
telephone interview. “It was strong enough to diminish some of
the downside worries, but it wasn’t so strong that you had a
situation where you’d be concerned about the Federal Reserve
accelerating any shift in its monetary-policy approach.”  The dollar depreciated 0.5 percent to $1.3640 per euro at 5
p.m. in New York and slid to $1.3711, the weakest level in more
than 14 months. The U.S. currency fell for a second week in its
first back-to-back losses this year. The euro climbed 1.7
percent to 126.66 yen and touched 126.97, the strongest since
April 2010. The dollar reached 92.97 yen, the highest since May
2010, before trading at 92.77, up 1.2 percent.  Stocks rallied, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rising
1 percent.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the euro compared with
those on a drop -- so-called  net longs  -- increased to the
biggest since July 2011. It was 27,472 on Jan. 29, compared with
net longs of 21,381 a week earlier.  Rand Gains  The South African rand gained versus all of its 16 most-
traded peers as a purchasing managers’ index for the country
rose in January to 49.1 from 47.4 the previous month. A reading
below 50 indicates a contraction in factory output. The rand
climbed 1.3 percent to 8.8398.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, reached its
highest level since August 2008 against the yen after  Reserve
Bank  of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler said the nation
needs to reduce the  budget deficit  or face higher interest
rates. The kiwi climbed 1.9 percent to 78.38 yen and touched
78.54. It added 0.7 percent to 84.49 U.S. cents.  Won Drops  The South Korean won fell versus most major peers. It had
its biggest weekly loss versus the dollar since May on concern a
weak Japanese currency will hurt the nation’s exports, and after
the government proposed a tax on securities trading to curb
speculative flows.  The won depreciated 0.8 percent to 1,097.38 and reached
1,098.25, its weakest level since Oct. 26. It lost 2.2 percent
on the week.  The euro pared gains briefly after the U.S. jobs report
raised concern the shared currency’s advance was too swift with
the American economy showing signs of recovery.  “This market has been relatively long euros, and nonfarm
payrolls are certainly an excuse to book some of that profit,”
 Dean Popplewell , head analyst at the online currency-trading
firm Oanda Corp., said in a phone interview from Toronto. Long
positions are bets a currency will gain.  Payrolls in the U.S. rose by 157,000 jobs, versus a
Bloomberg survey’s forecast of a gain of 165,000. The figure
followed a revised 196,000 advance in the prior month and a
247,000 surge in November, Labor Department figures showed today
in  Washington .  “This number suggests that the trend for stronger
employment growth in the states is intact,”  Jack Spitz ,
Toronto-based managing director of foreign-exchange trading at
 National Bank of Canada (NA) , said in a telephone interview.  Unemployment Rate  The  jobless rate  unexpectedly rose to 7.9 percent, from 7.8
percent. A Bloomberg survey had forecast it would hold steady.
The economy has recovered 5.51 million of the 8.74 million jobs
that were lost as a result of the last recession.  The Fed said Jan. 30 it will continue to purchase $85
billion of Treasury and mortgage securities each month “if the
outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially.”  Policy makers also left unchanged an earlier statement that
they planned to hold the benchmark  interest rate  near zero as
long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and projected
inflation stays below 2.5 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his Federal Open Market
Committee colleagues are deploying record stimulus through an
open-ended expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet after
determining that the benefits from stoking a flagging economy
outweigh any risk of financial instability or higher inflation.  European Manufacturing  The euro gained in January for a sixth straight month
against the dollar, the longest winning streak since May 2003,
as optimism increased that the worst is over in the currency
bloc’s sovereign-debt crisis.  A gauge of  manufacturing  in the 17-nation region rose to
47.9 in January, the most since February 2012, from 46.1 in
December, London-based Markit Economics said today. That was
above an  initial estimate  of 47.5 on Jan. 24. The reading has
been below the 50 level that signals contraction for 18 months.  The ECB is scheduled to meet Feb. 7 on interest rates.  Japan ’s currency headed for a 12th weekly decline against
the dollar as Abe faced a decision on who will replace  Bank of
Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, whose term ends in April. It’s
the longest weekly losing streak in records compiled by
Bloomberg dating to 1971. Abe has pushed for action to spur
economic growth and fight deflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
