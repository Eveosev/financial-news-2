European stocks  posted their biggest
weekly decline this year as a report showed the U.S. economy
unexpectedly shrank in the fourth quarter and Spain’s markets
regulator lifted a ban on shorting equities.  Spanish banks led a gauge of European lenders lower, with
 Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and Bankia SA each dropping more than 7
percent.  Saipem (SPM)  SpA plunged 36 percent, the most since at least
1989, after lowering its earnings forecasts for 2012 and 2013.
 Imagination Technologies (IMG)  Group Plc rallied 18 percent, the best
performance on the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) , after Morgan Stanley
recommended buying the company’s shares.  The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 0.5 percent to 288.2 this past
week, its biggest drop since the end of 2012. The gauge has
still advanced 3.1 percent so far this year after U.S. lawmakers
agreed to a compromise  federal budget  that prevented spending
cuts and tax increases from coming into force. The changes had
threatened to push the world’s biggest economy into a recession.  “The U.S. GDP report was a negative surprise that weighed
on markets, but investors did calm down after the initial
shock,” said Joerg Lorenz, a senior fund manager who oversees
about $560 million at Zuercher Kantonalbank in Zurich. “Most
markets need a break to digest the gains. Looking forward,
economic data indicate the bottom is behind us. This will
contribute to a stabilization on the markets in the mid-term.”  Contracting Economy  The U.S. economy contracted for the first time since the
second quarter of 2009. Gross domestic product dropped at a 0.1
percent annual rate, a Commerce Department release showed on
Jan. 30. That compared with the median estimate of 83 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg that called for a 1.1 percent expansion. A
report from the Labor Department showed that the unemployment
rate increased to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent.  A separate release showed that  U.S. house prices  increased
5.5 percent in the year through November, their biggest year-on-
year gain since August 2006.  Spanish banks slumped, with Banco de Sabadell SA plunging
14 percent and Bankia tumbling 25 percent, as the country’s
stock-market regulator, known as CNMV, said on Jan. 31 that it
wouldn’t extend a ban on shorting stocks.  Short sellers sell borrowed shares with the intention of
buying them back later at a lower price, a practice some
politicians and investors blame for increasing market
turbulence. Spain’s  IBEX 35 Index (IBEX)  had  soared 40 percent  from its
low last year through Jan. 31.  Santander’s Earnings  Santander lost 7.7 percent after the country’s largest
lender set aside money for further loan losses in its home
market. The bank reported  fourth-quarter profit  of 401 million
euros ($549 million), missing the average analyst estimate of
801.6 million euros.  National benchmark indexes retreated in 12 of western
Europe’s 18 markets this week. France’s CAC 40 dropped 0.1
percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index added 1 percent.
Germany’s DAX slipped 0.3 percent and Spain’s IBEX 35 slumped
5.7 percent, its biggest slide since September.  Saipem plunged 36 percent. Europe’s largest oil-services
company by sales lowered its forecast for earnings before
interest and taxes in 2012 to about 1.5 billion euros. Ebit will
fall to about 750 million euros in 2013, the company said. It
predicted that earnings from onshore projects would slump by
about 80 percent this year.  Other companies that provide engineering services to oil
companies slid on concern that the announcement signaled profit
would fall across the industry. Technip SA slipped 4.5 percent
and Subsea 7 SA declined 4.4 percent.  Monte Paschi  In Italy, Banca Monte dei Paschi SpA dropped 11 percent.
 The lender  facing a criminal probe into money-losing structured
deals had its credit rating cut by Standard & Poor’s on concern
the investigation may lead to bigger losses. The Siena-based
bank had its long-term grade lowered to BB from BB+. S&P
reiterated its negative outlook on the company.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the  copper producer  controlled by Chile’s
Luksic family, fell 7.8 percent after forecasting increased
costs this year. The expense of mining a pound of copper will
increase 14 percent to 185 cents in 2013, the company said.  Imagination Technologies rallied 18 percent. Morgan Stanley
upgraded the British maker of chip technology for phones and
tablet computers to overweight, the equivalent of buy, from
equal weight. The brokerage said the shares will surge as much
as 27 percent if Imagination gains access to the Chinese market
and wins a contract to design chips for Samsung Electronics
Co.’s Galaxy S4.  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  jumped 12 percent as the second-best
capitalized major lender in the European Union proposed a
 dividend  of 9.90 kronor a share, compared with 5.30 kronor a
year earlier. The lender posted net income of 4.34 billion
kronor ($690 million) in the fourth quarter, beating the 3.54
billion-krona average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  William Hill Plc (WMH)  gained 7.9 percent after the bookmaker
said full-year net revenue grew by 12 percent. The company,
which will release its  final results  on March 1, forecast
operating profit of 330 million pounds ($519 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
