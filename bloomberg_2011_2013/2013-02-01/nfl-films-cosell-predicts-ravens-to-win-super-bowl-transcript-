Greg Cosell, a senior producer at NFL
Films Inc. and a nephew of the late sportscaster  Howard Cosell ,
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political
Capital With  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend before Sunday
night’s Super Bowl in  New Orleans , that he expects the  Baltimore
Ravens  to defeat the  San Francisco 49ers  in a defense-minded
football championship game.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

the premier professional football analyst, Greg Cosell of NFL
Films. Both Greg and I feel a void in the first Super Bowl
without his boss and my lifetime friend, Steve Sabol, the genius
who ran NFL Films and played such a huge role in the popularity
of the sport.  Greg, Steve adored a great narrative, and he would have
loved Harbaugh versus Harbaugh. What’s the difference between
these two brothers and rival Super Bowl coaches?  GREG COSELL: That’s a great question, Al. I think they’re
very different, I think, in their personal approach, their
personality. I think  Jim Harbaugh  in  San Francisco  is a very
fiery guy. I think  John Harbaugh  is a lot more relaxed in his
demeanor on the sideline, totally different personalities. But
what’s very strange about that is I think the Baltimore Ravens
as a team, you could argue, are more reflective of Jim
Harbaugh’s personality, a more fiery team, whereas I think the
49ers are in some ways more reflective of John Harbaugh’s
personality, sort of very straightforward in their approach. So
it’s a real interesting dichotomy between the brothers and the
teams.  HUNT: That’s fascinating. We’re going to get into this
great match-up in just a moment, but first the background.
There’s a growing course of concern about violence in the game,
from President Obama to the multitude of legal suits against the
league from former players. Does America’s most popular sport
face a crisis here, Greg?  COSELL: You know, Al, I think to some degree, yes, but a
crisis that I don’t think will really happen for quite a while.
The problem - and I’ve talked to many players over these last
number of years, since it’s become a more significant issue -
and I can only tell you what they tell me, because obviously I’m
not a professional football player. The one thing I continually
hear from players is it’s almost impossible to legislate safety
in a game in which hitting people is really the modus operandi.
And that’s what I hear over and over again. You simply cannot
legislate safety.  HUNT: Yeah. Well, let’s go to the game. First, Colin
Kaepernick, the 49ers’ wunderkind quarterback, he only played
half a season, but he’s been dazzling. Is he the real deal? And
how do the Ravens stop him?  COSELL: Well, I think he - he’s starting his 10th game on
 Super Bowl  Sunday. I think we’re seeing a new element in the
NFL, and he’s sort of the poster child for it, because of his
running ability and, therefore, they can run what they call the
pistol, where it’s sort of a modified shotgun. They can do the
read option, where he sticks the ball in the running back’s
chest and he either gives it to him or then he can run.  I think he has that special running element. This is new in
the NFL, Al, so therefore defensive coaches are still trying to
figure this out. So right now, offenses - and particularly
Kaepernick and the 49ers - they’re one up on the rest of the
league.  Speaking specifically about the Ravens, the one thing I
think that pistol option offenses rely on is that the defense
will sit back and react to all this back-field action, as
opposed to being aggressive and proactive. I don’t think that’s
the Ravens’ personality. I think they’ll attack the backfield
action and try to speed it up. Now, you can get burned when you
do that, but I still think they’ll try to force Kaepernick and
that offense to play a little bit outside of structure instead
of allowing them to do what they want to do at their pace.  HUNT: And, Greg, on the other side,  Joe Flacco , mired in,
really, mediocrity a few months ago, played sensationally over
the last several games, besting  Peyton Manning  and  Tom Brady .
Which is the real Joe Flacco?  COSELL: Well, it’s funny, Al, because I think Joe Flacco
has actually had a very good five-year career. How often do we
hear people say about quarterbacks, “He’s a winner”? Now, I’m
not really sure exactly what that means, but for people who
believe that - and many do - Joe Flacco, in his first five
years, has won more games, regular season and playoffs combined,
than any quarterback in the history of the NFL. He’s also won
more road playoff games than any quarterback in the history of
the NFL.  So I’m not sure Joe Flacco’s image really needs any
rehabilitation. I think Joe Flacco has been a fine quarterback
for much of his career, and he really should have been in the
Super Bowl last year, if a receiver did not drop a perfectly
thrown ball.  HUNT: OK. Another narrative Steve would have loved,  Ray
Lewis ’ final game.  COSELL: Yeah.  HUNT: Now, he has some personal baggage, but a fabulous
career. Where does he rank in the pantheon of great linebackers,
Butkus, Taylor, Bednarik, Nitschke?  COSELL: Oh, I think you put him right there. I think Ray
Lewis’ ability - and, again, at this point in his career, he’s
not the same player. Everyone knows that. But he’s playing in
his 16th or 17th season. So you’re dealing with a linebacker
who, for the majority of his career, was an outstanding player.
And the thing that’s lost, because people see the gyrations,
they see the emotion, they see the enthusiasm, which is beyond
belief, but I think what really separates Ray Lewis, Al, was
what I like to call play recognition, many others called
instincts, as the all-encompassing term. But I don’t think there
was a smarter linebacker than Ray Lewis when it came to
diagnosing before the snap of the ball what the other team was
doing.  HUNT: Well, we’ll look for that Sunday night, despite his
advanced years, which don’t seem very old to me. The key match-
up...  COSELL: No, I agree with you on that.  (LAUGHTER)  HUNT: Greg, what are the key match-ups you’re looking for
Sunday night?  COSELL: On the Ravens’ offensive side of the ball, I’m
looking for their wide receivers against the cornerbacks for the
49ers, because one thing about Joe Flacco, Al, is he throws the
deep ball arguably better than any quarterback in the league.
They’re a downfield-passing team. So that is one match-up on
that side of the ball I’m looking forward, the receivers of the
Ravens versus the corners of the 49ers.  And then you mentioned the other key one already, and we
talked about it. It’s Colin Kaepernick. It’s how the Ravens
handle that, because if the Ravens cannot slow down the run game
to a certain extent, I’m not sure that the rest of their defense
will function. So that, to me, is the key element on that side
of the ball.  HUNT: Last year, Greg, you were in a distinct minority. You
predicted the  New York  Giants would upset the  New England
Patriots . You were prescient. Let’s - let’s risk the streak.
Who’s going to hold up the Lombardi Trophy Sunday night? And
what’ll the score be?  COSELL: I’d pick the Ravens to win 23-20. I think they’re
being underrated by many, many people. And I think this game
will not be quite as high-scoring as some think. Ravens 23,
49ers 20.  HUNT: All right. Greg Cosell, thank you so much for being
with us.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
