Oil capped the longest stretch of
weekly advances in more than eight years after reports showed
that U.S. hiring and manufacturing expanded last month.  Futures climbed 0.3 percent after the Labor Department said
payrolls rose 157,000 in January and the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s U.S.  factory index  reached a nine-month high. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 1 percent. Brent oil’s
premium to crude traded in New York widened because of limits on
a pipeline linking the Midwest to the  Gulf Coast .  “Prices have primarily moved higher on improving
perceptions about the economy,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market
strategist at Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis ,
which oversees $1.4 billion. “The numbers today show that the
economy was a little better than we thought and that’s mildly
supportive for both oil and the products.”  West  Texas  Intermediate oil for March delivery rose 28
cents to settle at $97.77 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Trading at 3:21 p.m. was 65 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day. The weekly gain of 2 percent is the
eighth in a row, matching a streak that ended in August 2004.  Brent oil for March delivery increased $1.21, or 1 percent,
to $116.76 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the highest settlement since Sept. 13. Trading was 41
percent higher than the 100-day average.  The European benchmark grade’s  premium  to WTI was $18.99.
The spread reached $19.60 earlier, the widest since Jan. 4,
after narrowing to $14.41 in intraday trading on Jan. 17.  Upward Revisions  The January increase in payrolls follows a revised 196,000
advance in the prior month and a 247,000 surge in November,
government figures showed today in  Washington .  The ISM index rose to 53.1 in January from 50.2 a month
earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg projected a reading of 50.7 for January,
according to the median of 86 forecasts.  The  Dow (INDU)  climbed above 14,000 for the first time since 2007
while the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  gained 1 percent. The
dollar fell as much as 1 percent against the euro. A weaker U.S.
currency bolsters the appeal of dollar-denominated commodities
as an investment.  The spread between the U.S. and European benchmark grades
widened after  Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD)  said yesterday that
restrictions at the Jones Creek terminal in Texas will limit
flows on the Seaway pipeline that links the Midwest to the Gulf
Coast until late 2013.  The pipeline began carrying crude to the Houston area from
Cushing,  Oklahoma , last month after the flow direction was
reversed. The Brent premium to WTI narrowed on speculation the
reversal would relieve a glut in the central U.S.  ‘Hurting’ WTI  “The realization that the Seaway reversal isn’t the answer
to the backlog of supply in the central U.S. is hurting the WTI
price,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a
New York-based energy hedge fund. “There was a lot of optimism,
which has quickly dissipated.”  Increasing oil output in the U.S. and  Canada  and the lack
of outlets has bolstered inventories at Cushing, the delivery
point for WTI. Supplies at the hub rose 284,000 barrels to 51.7
million last week, the Energy Information Administration said
Jan. 30, down from the record 51.9 million Jan. 11.  “It looks like the Seaway pipeline restart is not going to
happen as quickly as people thought and we still have that glut
situation,”  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “There is concern that supply is
going to back up.”  Technical Factors  Oil’s rally in  New York  may accelerate after the formation
of a bullish technical formation known as a “golden cross.”
The 50-day moving average now trades at a premium to the 200-day
indicator, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors
typically buy contracts when a moving average rises over a
longer-term one.  “I’m optimistic that we’ll continue to move higher,” said
Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc. in New York. “We got to a golden cross
formation yesterday when the 50- and 200-day moving averages
crossed, which is a bullish indicator.”  Crude may also gain strength if prices breach a four-month
high of $98.24 a barrel touched on Jan. 30, Yawger said.
Prearranged orders to buy oil at specific prices, known as
stops, will be triggered if futures exceed that level, he said.  “It looks like we will test Wednesday’s high of $98.24,”
Yawger said. “Once we break through that level, stops will be
triggered and length will jump in.”  Geopolitical Risk  Oil may increase next week as instability in the  Middle
East  and North Africa bolsters concern that shipments will be
disrupted, a Bloomberg survey showed. Eighteen of 43 analysts,
or 42 percent, forecast an increase. Sixteen respondents, or 37
percent, predicted a decline and nine forecast little change.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 731,524
contracts as of 3:15 p.m. It totaled 672,684 contracts
yesterday, 32 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.57 million, the highest level since Nov. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
