Peruvian consumer prices rose less
than economists expected last month, fueling speculation the
central bank will keep borrowing costs on hold.  Consumer prices  increased 0.12 percent from December and
climbed 2.87 percent from the same month a year earlier, the
national statistics agency said in an e-mailed statement today.
Economists expected a 0.19 percent increase on the month and a
2.94 percent rise on the year, according to the median estimate
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The central bank held its  benchmark lending rate  at 4.25
percent for a 20th consecutive month on Jan. 10 on the
expectation inflation will slow to 2 percent this year. The
bank’s board next meets Feb. 7.  “Looking at the activity indicators and prices, in theory
they shouldn’t change  interest rates ,” said  Mario Guerrero , an
economist at Scotiabank Peru SA.  The central bank increased lenders’ reserve requirements
for a second straight month Jan. 30 as part of an effort to
weaken the sol.  Gross domestic product will rise as much as 6.3 percent
this year, which is below the economy’s potential growth rate,
and the bank doesn’t see inflationary pressures, central bank
President Julio Velarde said in a Jan. 30 interview.  “We don’t see a need for a dramatic change of rates now,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
