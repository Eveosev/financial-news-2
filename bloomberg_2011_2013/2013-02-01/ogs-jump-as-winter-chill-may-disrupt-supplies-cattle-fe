Hog futures headed for a fourth
straight weekly gain, the longest rally since November 2011, on
speculation that demand for animals will rise as winter weather
disrupts supplies. Cattle fell.  Parts of southwest to northeast  Iowa  received 4 inches (10
centimeters) to 8 inches of snow earlier this week, Joel Widenor, a vice president for Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a telephone interview. Temperatures
fell to minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 21 Celsius) to minus
10 degrees today, he said. The National Weather Service has
issued wind chill  advisories  for northeastern Iowa.  “We had snowfall and ice across the western Corn Belt, and
now we’ve got subzero temperatures,” Doug Houghton, an analyst
at Brock Associates, said in a telephone interview from
 Milwaukee . “There are probably less hogs moving to market,
which is creating enough supply tightness to force competition
here.”  Hog futures for April settlement climbed 0.4 percent to
89.675 cents a pound at 11 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that price would be a 0.8 percent weekly
gain.  Cash  hogs  rose 2.4 percent yesterday to 86.33 cents a
pound, the highest since Aug. 14, and wholesale  pork  fell 0.5
percent to 85.04 cents a pound, a one-week low, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. That signals that packers are losing
money, which may slow their purchases and curb the price rally,
Houghton said.  Cattle futures for April delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$1.3245 a pound in Chicago. Prices rallied 0.4 percent in
January, the fourth straight monthly gain.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement slid 0.3 percent
to $1.49075 a pound on the CME. Prices fell 3.1 percent last
month, the biggest decline since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
