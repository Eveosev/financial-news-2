Scottish Water Ltd., the fourth-
largest water and wastewater services provider in the U.K.,
today formally named Douglas Millican as chief executive officer
following the death last October of Richard Ackroyd.  Millican, the finance and regulation director since the
private water company was formed in 2002, had been serving as
interim CEO, Scottish Water said in a statement. The company,
whose head office is in Dunfermline, has about 5 million
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
