Copper rose in  London , set for the
largest weekly gain in four, amid indications economies are
reviving in  China  and the U.S., the world’s two biggest users of
the metal.  Chinese manufacturing expanded for a fourth month in
January, a purchasing managers’ index released by the country’s
statistics bureau and its logistics federation showed. A report
due at 1:30 p.m. London time will show hiring in the U.S. sped
up last month to 165,000 workers, the most since August,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “The Chinese economy is continuing to recover all the
same, albeit somewhat less dynamically than anticipated,”
 Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt ,
said today in a report. “Market players are also likely to be
looking with interest at the U.S. labor-market figures.”  Copper for delivery in three months climbed 0.6 percent to
$8,210 a metric ton by 10:44 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices are up 2.2 percent this week. Futures for March delivery
rose 0.1 percent to $3.735 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  Copper traders are the most bullish in 15 months on
mounting confidence the  U.S. economy  will rebound at a time when
China’s recovery is gaining momentum. Twenty-five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices to rise next week and five
were bearish, making the proportion of bulls the highest since
Oct. 14, 2011.  Figures due Feb. 4 will show U.S. factory orders gained for
a third month in four in December, economists said.  Stockpiles of copper tracked by the LME rose 1.1 percent to
376,000 tons, the highest level since Dec. 16, 2011, daily
exchange figures showed. Inventories in  New Orleans , the biggest
repository, climbed for a fourth session to 103,550 tons. Orders
to draw the metal from stocks slid 5.9 percent to 34,600 tons.  “Market players have been ignoring the increase in
stocks,” Briesemann said. “This is clearly being overshadowed
by the positive economic outlook and growing risks to supply.”  Nickel led gains on the LME. Aluminum, zinc, lead and tin
advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
