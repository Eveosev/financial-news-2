The  budget deficit  of the Netherlands
will widen in 2013 after the government decided to take  SNS
Reaal NV (SR)  into state control at a cost of 3.7 billion euros ($5
billion), Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said.  “This will lead to a worsening of the budget deficit” by
0.6 percentage points in 2013, Dijsselbloem said at a press
conference in The Hague today. The Dutch government and the
Dutch central bank said the nationalization of the bank will
cost the state 2.2 billion euros in capital injections, 800
million euros to write off earlier aid and 700 million euros to
separate SNS’s property-finance unit.  The government’s central planning agency CPB had forecast a
budget deficit of 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this
year. The government will decide in March on possible budget
measures, Dijsselbloem said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
