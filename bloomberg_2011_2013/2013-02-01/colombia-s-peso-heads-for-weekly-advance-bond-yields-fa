Colombia’s peso posted its first
weekly gain since early January on speculation that the central
bank’s plan to boost dollar purchases won’t curb the local
currency’s appreciation.  The peso climbed 0.2 percent this week to 1,776.18 per
dollar. It declined less than 0.1 percent at the close of
trading today in Bogota. It is down 0.5 percent this year after
rallying 9.7 percent in 2012, the most among major Latin
American currencies.  The central bank said on Jan. 28 that it will buy at least
$30 million daily in the foreign exchange market from February
through May, for a total of at least $3 billion during the
period. The program would boost average purchases from $500
million per month to no less than $750 million per month,
according to the monetary authority’s statement.  “The currency measures weren’t as aggressive as some may
have been expecting,” Alejandro Reyes, the head analyst at
Ultrabursatiles SA brokerage, said in a phone interview today
from Bogota. “The comments from policy makers this week
recognized that they can’t change the peso’s trend.”  Central bank co-director Juan Jose Echavarria said Jan. 30
that policy makers can’t control the peso’s level over the long
term. “Colombia has a complicated currency problem and that’s
not up to the central bank to fix,” he said at an event in
Bogota.  Yields on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
5.20 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.408 centavo to 140.624 centavos per peso.  Colombia could cut its benchmark interest rate 50 basis
points to 3.5 percent in the first half of 2013 after a slowdown
in growth left the economy operating below capacity, Nomura
Securities International Inc. said in a research report
published today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
