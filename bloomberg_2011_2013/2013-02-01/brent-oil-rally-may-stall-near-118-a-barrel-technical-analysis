Brent crude , which gained the most in
five months in January, may slow its advance in  London  as prices
reach technical resistance starting at $118 a barrel, according
to  Societe Generale  SA.  The North Sea oil, a benchmark grade for more than half the
world’s crude, is approaching a downward-sloping trend line that
halted rallies in 2011 and 2012, the bank said in its first-
quarter outlook. Beyond that resistance level, further price
increases may stall around $127, along the top of a range within
which futures have traded since mid-2010.  “Brent is drifting higher towards the upper part of the
two-year range at $113 and $118 but with a lack of momentum,”
Stephanie Aymes, a London-based technical analyst at  France ’s
fourth-largest bank, said in a report e-mailed yesterday. “The
steep bullish dynamic since 2008 is broken.”  Global  oil prices  have risen on speculation a U.S. economic
recovery signals demand will increase in the largest crude-
consuming nation. The Brent contract for March settlement on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange was at $115.83 a barrel, up 28
cents, at 12:56 p.m. Singapore time. Prices rebounded 4 percent
last month, the most since August.  The $118-a-barrel resistance target, signaling an area
where sell orders may be clustered, is taken from a downtrend
line that connects Brent’s monthly candlesticks of July 2008 and
May 2011, Societe Generale’s chart shows. Futures last traded at
$118 in May 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
