Norbord Inc. (NBD) , the third-largest North
American maker of wood sheathing used to build homes, rose the
most in three months after BMO Capital Markets upgraded the
shares.  Norbord  rose  5.8 percent to C$30.95 at 1:14 p.m. in
Toronto. Earlier the shares rose as much as 8 percent, the most
intraday since Oct. 26.  Stephen Atkinson, a Montreal-based BMO analyst, raised his
rating to buy from hold and increased his 12-month price target
to C$37 from C$35, according to a note today to clients.  Norbord is benefiting from a recovery in U.S. housing
construction and higher prices for oriented-strand board, a
lumber look-alike that’s made by gluing wood flakes together.  Norbord’s “installed operations ran at near full capacity
of 95 percent” last year, Atkinson said in the note  Fourth-quarter net income was $38 million, or 76 cents a
share, Toronto-based Norbord said yesterday in a statement. That
beat the 73-cent average of eight analysts’  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Our results reflect a U.S. housing recovery that is now
well entrenched,” the company said in the statement.  Louisiana-Pacific Corp. (LPX)  is the largest North American maker
of OSB by production capacity, followed by Georgia-Pacific LLC,
according to a presentation on Norbord’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
