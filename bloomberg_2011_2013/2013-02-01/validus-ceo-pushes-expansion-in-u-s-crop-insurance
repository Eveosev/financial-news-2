Validus Holdings Ltd. (VR) , the reinsurer
that reported a fourth-quarter loss yesterday, increased its
investment in U.S. crop coverage as a drought-generated surge in
claims boosts policy prices.  “We see prices becoming more attractive” in crop
insurance, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Noonan said
today in an interview. “We are a more sizable crop insurer
going forward than we have been historically.”  Noonan, 54, said Bermuda-based Validus has written $55
million in crop-insurance business since Jan. 1. Policies in the
U.S. Midwest and South cover crops including corn and soybeans,
he said.  The worst drought since the 1930s led to record payouts on
crop-insurance claims. Farmers collected more than $13 billion
in the crop year through Jan. 28, exceeding the record of $10.84
billion set in 2011, according to a Risk Management Agency
report published on the U.S. Department of Agriculture website.  Validus said yesterday it had a  fourth-quarter loss  of
$90.7 million, or 94 cents a share, compared with net income of
$27.3 million, or 25 cents, a year earlier. The reinsurer was
little changed at $36.51 at 2:19 p.m. today in New York and has
gained 12 percent in the past year.  Validus is in the process of acquiring closely held
Bermuda-based reinsurer Longhorn Re to help expand in crop
coverage, Noonan said.  “Its sole business was crop reinsurance and people we knew
and have known for some time like the way they do business,”
Noonan said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
