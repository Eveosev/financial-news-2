The ruble headed for its fourth
weekly gain as oil rallied and U.S. jobs data encouraged
investors to seek higher-yielding assets.  The ruble added 0.3 percent to 29.9500 against the dollar
by 7 p.m. in Moscow, and climbed by the same in the week to the
highest level since May 5 on a closing basis. The ruble rose 0.2
percent to 34.8042 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket, 15 kopeks weaker than the level at which traders say the
regulator may intervene to curb gains.  Crude oil,  Russia ’s main export, gained 0.8 percent in
London trading to $116.32 per barrel. Hiring in the U.S.
increased in January after accelerating more than previously
estimated at the end 2012, according to data today. The Federal
Reserve said this week it will keep buying bonds to spur
economic growth and reduce unemployment.  “External factors are supportive,” Igor Akinshin, foreign
currency trader at Alfa Bank, said by phone.  The ruble may strengthen as much as 0.7 percent to 29.75
per dollar and by 0.4 percent to 34.65 to the basket at the
start of next week, Peter Neimyshev, head of foreign exchange at
Otkritie Bank, said by e-mail. “We don’t expect a stronger
appreciation,” he said.  Bank Rossii bought 4.62 billion rubles ($154 million) of
foreign currency on Jan. 24 and Jan. 25 to curb the ruble’s
appreciation, data on the regulator’s website show.  “If the central bank and the government don’t want a
stronger ruble, it won’t get stronger,” Akinshin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
