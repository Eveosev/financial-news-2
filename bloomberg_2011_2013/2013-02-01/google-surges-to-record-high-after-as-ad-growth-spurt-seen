Google Inc. (GOOG) , operator of the world’s
largest search engine, closed at a record high after reporting
earnings last week that topped estimates, buoying investor
sentiment about growth prospects.  The  shares  advanced 2.6 percent to $775.60 at yesterday’s
close in New York, their highest value since the company went
public in August 2004. They have gained 34 percent in the past
12 months, compared with a 14 percent increase for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.  Google is benefiting from rising demand as marketers seek
to advertise via mobile devices and local services, areas where
rivals such as  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  also sell
advertising. Fourth-quarter profit, excluding certain items,
rose to $10.65 a share, the company said Jan. 22. Analysts on
average had estimated profit of $10.50 a share.  “In all of the growth areas of online advertising, Google
has a big presence,”  Sameet Sinha , an analyst at B Riley & Co.,
said in an interview. “Rather than picking the best horse,
here’s someone executing on all fronts.”  Sinha  rates  Google a buy, and doesn’t own any shares.  Google had more than 41 percent of all digital ad revenue
in the U.S. in 2012, according to EMarketer Inc. In mobile,
Google holds a 53 percent share, compared with 8.4 percent for
Facebook. Google dominates the U.S. search-based advertising
market, with a 75 percent share, according to EMarketer’s
estimates.  Three-quarters of the 33 analysts covering Google rate the
shares a buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those
analysts  have  raised their target price for the stock, on
average, to $824.83, from $796.66 a day before the company’s
latest earnings report.  Sales at  Mountain View , California-based Google rose 36
percent in the fourth quarter to $14.42 billion from a year
earlier. The boost came after the average cost of ads rose 2
percent during the fourth quarter from the previous period, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
