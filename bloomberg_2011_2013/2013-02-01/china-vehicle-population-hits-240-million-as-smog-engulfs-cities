China added more cars last year than
the total number plying its roads in 1999, illustrating the
challenges the government faces in controlling vehicular
emissions and traffic congestion in its cities.  The vehicle population reached 240 million last year, of
which 120 million were passenger cars, according to a statement
by the  Ministry of Public Security  on its website. The 15.1
million new cars added last year were more than the entire car
population at the end of 1999, the ministry said.  Sales of new vehicles are forecast to top 20 million this
year for the first time, as growth rebounds in the world’s
second-largest economy. Beijing implemented vehicle emission
standards today that match the strictest European guidelines in
an attempt to cut down on pollutants as toxic smog engulfed the
capital for much of the past month.  U.S. embassy readings showed air quality in Beijing reached
“hazardous” levels on 20 days in January.  Demand for vehicles will be supported by the number of
first-time drivers, which reached 26.5 million. That alone was
higher than the total number of motorists in 1997 and helped
boost the entire driving population to 260 million last year,
the ministry said.  Car ownership exceeded one million in 18 Chinese cities,
according to the ministry.  Passenger-vehicle sales this year may climb 8.5 percent to
about 16.8 million units, as the total number of vehicles sold
surpass 20 million for the first time, according to the state-
backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
