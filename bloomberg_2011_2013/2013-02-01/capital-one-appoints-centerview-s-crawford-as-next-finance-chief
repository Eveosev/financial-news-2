     Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Capital One Financial Corp., the
lender that gets more than half its revenue from credit cards,
named Centerview Partners LLP co-founder Stephen S. Crawford to
succeed Gary L. Perlin as chief financial officer.  Crawford, 48, joins the firm next week and will become its
finance chief in May when Perlin, 61, retires, the McLean,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Crawford also
will be a memeber of the executive committee, reporting to
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard D. Fairbank.  Crawford advised Capital One on strategic and financial
decisions while at Centerview, the New York-based investment
banking boutique founded in 2006, according to the statement. He
previously worked at  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in roles including CFO.  “Gary has been a trusted and valued partner over the past
decade,” Fairbank said in the statement. “His counsel and
leadership were instrumental as we successfully weathered an
unprecedented financial crisis and emerged in an even stronger
position to grow our company and create  shareholder value .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
