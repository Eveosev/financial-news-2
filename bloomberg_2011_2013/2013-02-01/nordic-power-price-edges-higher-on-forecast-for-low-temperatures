Nordic electricity for next month had
the biggest gain in more than two weeks after carbon prices
rebounded, increasing production costs at fossil fuel-fired
generators.  Power for March gained as much as 1.5 percent to 37.50
euros ($51.07) a megawatt-hour on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy
exchange in Oslo, the biggest rise since Jan. 16. The contract
traded at 37.35 euros as of 2:08 p.m. Power for delivery next
quarter traded 1.6 percent higher at 35.65 euros after rising as
high as 35.70 euros.  EU carbon permits for December surged 20 percent to 4.11
euros a metric ton after falling as low as 3.22 euros on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London . Electricity prices can track
carbon, which influences generating costs at coal and gas-fed
plants.  Freezing temperatures are likely to spur demand for
electric heating in the coming weeks. Low temperatures in Oslo
may drop to minus 15 degrees Celsius (7 Fahrenheit) on Feb. 4,
from minus 12 today, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on
Bloomberg. Temperatures are forecast to drop to minus 24 degrees
on Feb. 12.  “If the weather gets cold, it will erode water supplies
and offer support to prices for the April through September
period,” Kjell Idar Saure, a trader at utility Tussa Kraft AS,
said by phone from Oersta, on  Norway ’s west coast.  The amount of water and snow available to generate
electricity in the region may be 13.2 terawatt-hours below
normal for the time of year in two weeks, Markedskraft AS data
on Bloomberg show. That’s 23 percent more than today’s deficit
of 10.8 terawatt-hours. The Nordic region meets more than half
of its power needs by running water through turbines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
