Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  has received
44,000 applications for 400 flight-attendant positions,
showcasing demand for jobs with the  U.S. unemployment rate  mired
near 8 percent.  “We received an incredible number of applications for
these positions,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Anderson said
in a weekly recorded message to employees. A panel of flight
attendants already working for Delta will begin interviewing
candidates next week, he said.  The surge in applications means would-be employees have a
1-in-110 chance of being hired. Delta said in December that
22,000 people applied at a rate of two per minute in the first
week the jobs were posted outside the Atlanta-based company.  The flight attendants are being hired so they can be
trained and ready to fly in June when the peak summer travel
season begins. Delta, the world’s second-largest carrier, has
said it is seeking workers who speak languages including
Japanese, Hindi, Mandarin and Portuguese.  Delta joins American Airlines parent AMR Corp. and US
Airways Group Inc. in drawing thousands of applications for new
positions.  American accepted 20,000 applications for 1,500 flight-
attendant jobs in November and closed the process after a week,
said Missy Cousino, a spokeswoman for AMR. The first group of
hires is going through training now and will start flying in
April, she said.  US Airways  US Airways said in January it drew 16,500 applicants for
its 450 openings in the carrier’s biggest hiring push for flight
attendants since 2010.  In 2010, Delta received 100,000 applications for 1,000 job
openings.  Nationwide, the pace of job growth hasn’t been strong
enough to dissuade the Federal Reserve from supporting the
expansion through accommodative monetary policy.  The U.S. unemployment rate, which climbed to 7.9 percent
last month, has remained within 20 basis points of 8 percent
since March.  “Employment has continued to expand at a moderate pace but
the unemployment rate remains elevated,” the Federal Open
Market Committee said at the Jan. 30 conclusion of its two-day
meeting in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
