Gold gained for the third time in
four days as U.S. hiring picked up in the past three months,
signaling an improving economy that may fuel inflation as the
 Federal Reserve  adds more stimulus. Silver also climbed.  Payrolls rose 157,000 in January and the previous two
months were revised higher, government figures showed today. The
jobless rate increased to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent. The Fed
said this week it will maintain monthly debt purchases.  “The payrolls number was very good, and the Fed’s
stimulating the economy creates a boost, so the thinking is that
this is inflationary,” Carlos Perez-Santalla, a broker at PVM
Futures Inc. in Hoboken,  New Jersey , said in a telephone
interview. “The assumption is that with more money being dumped
into the system, we’ll see quicker debasement of the currency.”  Gold futures for April delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,670.60 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Silver futures for March delivery jumped 1.9 percent to
$31.958 an ounce, the biggest gain among 24  raw materials  in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  The labor revisions added a total of 127,000 jobs to the
employment count in November and December.  “The  unemployment rate  ticked up a bit, and the Fed has
said they’ll hold rates low until that comes down,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, said in a telephone interview. “The Fed will keep
going on its mandate, and that’s helping gold.”  Gold has dropped 4.5 percent in the past 12 months. Credit
Suisse Group AG said today in a report that a recovering global
economy and tame inflation suggest that “downside risks” are
building. The metal probably peaked in 2011, and a forecast for
a record-high average in the third quarter “may prove to be too
bullish,” the bank said.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery increased 0.7 percent to $1,687.70 an ounce.
Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 1.4 percent to
$756.40 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
