Russia  should share more information
with NATO about military exercises the country conducts in the
Baltic region, North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary
General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said.  “We don’t have detailed information about upcoming Russian
military exercises,” Rasmussen told reporters today in the
Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, when asked about the West 2013
exercise that Russia and Belarus plan in September. “It’s of
utmost importance to demonstrate openness and full transparency
when it comes to military exercises.”  NATO’s three Baltic members, Lithuania, Latvia and  Estonia ,
have expressed concern about increasing numbers of Russian
troops and weapons stationed near their borders. The 28-nation
alliance is committed to Lithuania “24 hours a day, 7 days a
week, 365 days a year,” Rasmussen said, adding that its
aircraft are policing the airspace of the three countries.  NATO will practice its own plans for the collective defense
of the Baltics and  Poland  in a military exercise this year,
Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite told reporters at the
same press conference. The military alliance renewed its Baltic
strategy at a summit last year in  Chicago , deciding among other
things to make an air policing mission in the region permanent,
she said.  “We do not consider Russia a threat to NATO, and NATO
definitely does not constitute a threat to Russia,” Rasmussen
said. “But we have all plans in place to protect and defend
NATO allies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
