LCH Clearnet Ltd.,  Europe ’s biggest
clearing house, reduced the extra deposit it demands from
clients to trade some Spanish and French government bonds, it
said today in a statement on its  website .  The margin for trading Spain’s securities maturing in 10 to
15 years will drop to 16 percent from 18.35 percent as of the
close of business on Feb. 5, according to the statement.  For French debt, charges will decline for all maturities
except securities maturing from zero to one month and 15 to 30
years, LCH said.  No changes were made to margins for trading Italian debt,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
