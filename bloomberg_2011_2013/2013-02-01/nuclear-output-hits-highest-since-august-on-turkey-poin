U.S. nuclear-power generation rose
for a fifth day, reaching the highest level of output since
August, as reactors increased output in Florida and  Ohio .  Nationwide production climbed 0.7 percent to 95,544
megawatts, or 94 percent of capacity,  the highest level  since
Aug. 8, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 3.9 percent higher than a year
ago, with six of 104 reactors offline.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  returned the 720-megawatt Turkey Point
3 reactor to full power from 60 percent of capacity yesterday.
The unit, 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Miami, was slowed
Jan. 29 for planned turbine-valve testing and routine
maintenance on equipment.  The 1,261-megawatt Perry 1 plant, 35 miles northeast of
Cleveland, Ohio, operated at 99 percent of capacity early today,
up from 68 percent yesterday.  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  has been
restoring the unit to full power since Jan. 27. The reactor
tripped offline Jan. 22 when power to the feedwater system was
interrupted, resulting in a declining water level.  Production rose in every region except the West, where
Grand Gulf 1, 20 miles south of Vicksburg, Mississippi, dropped
to 88 percent output from 94 percent yesterday.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  is
returning the 1,297-megawatt reactor to full power after a
generator trip Jan. 14.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
