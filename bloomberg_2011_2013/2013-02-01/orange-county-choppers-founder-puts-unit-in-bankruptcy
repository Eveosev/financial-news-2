TV star Paul Teutul Sr., founder of
Orange County Choppers Holdings Inc., sought U.S. Bankruptcy
Court protection for his merchandising unit with plans to
liquidate its assets.  The family-run custom-built motorcycle company operated by
Teutul and his son, Paul Jr., is based in Newburgh,  New York .
Its Hudson Valley Merchandising LLC listed $1.12 million in
assets and $1.44 million in debts in papers filed yesterday in
Poughkeepsie, New York. The parent company didn’t file.  Under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code a trustee will
automatically be appointed to dismantle the company, sell its
assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors.  The Teutuls’ “American Chopper” reality television show
ended its decadelong run on the  Discovery Channel  in December.
It featured the antics and interactions between father and son
in their New York state motorcycle shop.  Jonathan S. Pasternak, a lawyer representing the bankrupt
company, didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment
on the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
