Euribor futures rose to the highest
in a week after the European Central Bank said lenders will
repay another 3.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) of its three-year
loans.  The price of the euro interbank offered rate futures
contract due December 2013 climbed to 99.49 cents, the highest
since Jan. 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price was 99.48 cents at 12:43 p.m. in  London  and the implied
yield, which moves inversely to the price, fell to 0.53 percent.  The ECB said today that 27 banks will use the second
opportunity to repay its emergency three-year loans. Financial
firms already returned 137.2 billion euros of funds from the
first Longer Term Refinancing Operation this week.  “The repayment number was below market expectations this
week, as many had thought that banks taking a ‘wait and see’
approach would have been emboldened to repay by high
participation in the first window,” Michael Symonds, a credit
analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets in London, wrote in a note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
