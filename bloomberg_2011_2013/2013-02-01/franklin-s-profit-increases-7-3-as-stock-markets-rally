Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , manager of
the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, said fiscal first-
quarter profit rose 7.3 percent as a rally in global stock
markets boosted assets under management.  Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 climbed to
$516.1 million or $2.42 a share, from $480.8 million or $2.20, a
year earlier, the  San Mateo , California-based company said today
in a statement.  Twenty analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg expected
profit averaging $2.38 a share.  Chief Executive Officer Gregory Johnson has been urging
investors to put more money into stock funds, arguing that
equities are likely to deliver better returns than they did in
the past decade. Equity-oriented funds accounted for about 39
percent of Franklin’s $782 billion in assets at year-end.  “If retail investors get more comfortable with risk and we
start to see them reallocate money to equities, Franklin should
do well in that environment,”  Michael Kim , an analyst with
Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in  New York , said in a telephone
interview before the results were announced.  Stock mutual funds in the U.S. attracted $14.3 billion in
net new money in the week ended Jan. 9, the most since at least
2007, according to the Washington-based  Investment Company
Institute . Both domestic and international equity funds won
money in the first two weeks of 2013, ICI data show.  Franklin’s equity assets climbed to $303 billion as of Dec.
31, up 12 percent for the year, as the MSCI All-Country World
Index rose 13 percent in 2012. More than 70 percent of the
firm’s stock assets are global or international.  Hasenstab’s Fund  The company’s flagship fund, the $67 billion  Templeton
Global Bond Fund, (TPINX)  bounced back last year after it trailed 91
percent of rivals in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The fund, managed by  Michael Hasenstab , gained 16
percent in 2012, better than 90 percent of peers.  Hasenstab’s results were driven by bets on countries such
Ireland and Hungary, whose bonds rallied 29 percent and 22
percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
Templeton Global Bond had 9 percent of its money in Irish bonds
and 5.8 percent in Hungarian bonds as of Nov. 30, according to a
regulatory filing.  Hasenstab’s fund attracted $1.5 billion in deposits in the
fourth quarter, data from Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  show.
That compares with $355 million in the third quarter. Hasenstab
manages more than $175 billion.  Franklin in September agreed to pay about $183 million for
a majority stake in K2 Advisors Holdings LLC, a fund-of-hedge-
 fund manager  with $9.3 billion in assets. Starting in 2016,
Franklin will acquire the rest of  Stamford , Connecticut-based K2
over a period of years.  Before today, Franklin’s shares gained 8.9 percent this
year compared to an increase of 10 percent for the 20-member
Standard and Poor’s Index of custody banks and asset managers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
