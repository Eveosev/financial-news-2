A female police officer was arrested
over leaks to the media as part of a probe into allegations a
government minister insulted officers guarding the U.K. prime
minister’s residence.  It is the fourth arrest, and second in two days, in an
investigation into the accusations made against  Andrew Mitchell 
that led to his resignation as the government’s Chief Whip.  An officer said Mitchell, who was in charge of discipline
at the  Conservative Party , called police “plebs” after they
refused to let him cycle through the main gate at 10 Downing
Street in September. The constable, 46, arrested today was
present during the alleged incident, police said in a statement.  A report by Channel 4 News televised Dec. 18 said a police
officer had posed as a member of the public and falsely claimed
to have witnessed the events in an e-mail to a lawmaker.  The female officer was arrested on suspicion of misconduct
in public office in connection with unauthorized disclosure of
information to the media. She is being held at a London police
station.  A 46-year-old male officer, who wasn’t at Downing Street
when the incident occurred, was arrested yesterday and later
granted bail.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  may restore Mitchell to office
if new evidence exonerates him, a person familiar with the
premier’s thinking said last month.  “All I would say is it is very important that this
investigation is thoroughly carried out and proper answers are
delivered,” Cameron told reporters today in Monrovia, Liberia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
