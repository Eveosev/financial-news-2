BlackBerry (RIMM) ’s new Z10 smartphone is
attracting bids of as much as $1,775 on  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s auction
site, a sign of early demand for the device in the U.S., where
it doesn’t go on sale till next month.  As of this afternoon, a BlackBerry Z10 receiving 14 bids
reached that price on  EBay’s site . In another auction, one of
the phones climbed to $1,625, with 27 bids. Phones on EBay are
typically sold “unlocked,” meaning they don’t require a
carrier contract. When the Z10 officially goes on sale in the
U.S., the unlocked version is expected to cost $599.  BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion, unveiled
the new phone this week and made it available to U.K. wireless
subscribers through Vodafone Group Plc and other carriers. It
goes on sale in  Canada  on Feb. 5 and in the United Arab Emirates
on Feb. 10. U.S. consumers, meanwhile, don’t have a firm release
date for the phone, which is expected sometime in March.  BlackBerry is counting on the Z10 to reverse sales declines
and win over users of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) ’s Galaxy. While the phone garnered positive
reviews for its intuitive keyboard and other features,
BlackBerry’s stock tumbled this week, dragged down by concerns
about the slow U.S. release.  Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins has said lengthy
device testing at  AT&T Inc. (T)  and Verizon Wireless is the main
reason for the delay. When the Z10 does go on sale in the U.S.,
it will cost about $199 on a two-year contract and $599 without
one, Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry has said.  BCE Inc. (BCE) , Canada’s largest phone company, is offering the
phone for C$149.95 ($150) with a three-year contract and
C$649.95 with no commitment.  After five days of declines, BlackBerry shares climbed 0.4
percent today to $13.03 in New York. The stock rose 9.4 percent
in January.  ---With assistance from Doug Alexander in Toronto. Editor: Nick
