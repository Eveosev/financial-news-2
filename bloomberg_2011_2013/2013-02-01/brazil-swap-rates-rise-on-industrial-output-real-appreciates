Brazil ’s swap rates rose for a third
day as industrial output in December beat forecasts, boosting
speculation that the central bank will increase borrowing costs
to contain inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 climbed four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.99 percent at 10:15
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , the highest level since Nov. 22 on a closing
basis. They have climbed three basis points this week. The real
advanced 0.2 percent to 1.9884 per dollar, extending its gain
since Jan. 25 to 2.1 percent, the biggest among major Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Brazil’s industrial production was little changed in
December from a month earlier after a 1.3 percent decline in the
prior month, the national statistics agency reported today. The
median forecast of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
0.4 percent drop.  “The industrial production number was a little better than
expected,” Thiago Carlos, an economist at Link SA in Sao Paulo,
said by phone. “Economic activity remains weak and inflation is
high.”  The real rallied to a level stronger than 2 per  U.S. dollar 
on Jan. 28 for the first time since July as the central bank
intervened to boost the currency as inflation accelerated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
