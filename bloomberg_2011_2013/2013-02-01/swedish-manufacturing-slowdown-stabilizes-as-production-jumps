Sweden’s manufacturing  slowdown
stabilized in January as production increased.  An index based on responses from purchasing managers was a
seasonally adjusted 49.2 in January compared with 44.6 the
previous month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which compiles the
index, said today. A reading below 50 signals a contraction. The
index was estimated to rise to 46.1, according to the  average
estimate  of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Swedish economic  growth  slowed to 0.9 percent last year
from 3.7 percent in 2011 as a slowdown abroad hurt demand for
the country’s exports, the government predicted on Dec. 21. The
Swedish central bank in December cut its main lending rate for a
fourth time to 1 percent in a bid to boost growth.  PMI’s production sub-index rose to 53.8 from 45.3 while the
order index rose to 49.7 from 41.3. The employment index rose to
40.8 from 40.5 and the delivery time index gained to 50.4 from
45.3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
