Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) , the
San Diego-based pay-as-you-go wireless carrier, climbed the most
in three weeks after Janco Partners Inc. raised its rating on
the stock to strong buy.  The shares rose 4.2 percent to $6.02 at the close in  New
York . The stock had fallen 28 percent in 2012, its sixth
straight year with a decline of at least 20 percent.  The company has spectrum that may be valuable in an
acquisition, and the stock is worth at least $7.50, said Gerard Hallaren, an analyst at  Greenwood Village , Colorado-based Janco.
Even if Leap’s quarterly earnings this month disappoint
investors, Hallaren said he expects the shares to rebound.  “Expectations for the fourth quarter are fairly low,” he
said in an interview. “Should the company miss, I think the
stock will not stay down more than a couple of days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
