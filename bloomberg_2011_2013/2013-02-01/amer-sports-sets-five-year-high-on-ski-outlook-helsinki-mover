Amer Sports Oyj (AMEAS) , the maker of Salomon
and Atomic skiing equipment, climbed to a five-year high as
analysts raised their price estimates, citing prospects for a
rebound in winter-sports demand.  Amer Sports advanced as much as 6.9 percent to 12.55 euros
in Helsinki, where the company is based. That’s the biggest
intraday gain in more than three months and the highest price
since January 2008. Volume exceeded 270,000 shares, more than
the six-month daily average. The stock was the second-best
performer in the  Stoxx Europe 600 index  today.  Earnings before interest and taxes will rise 30 percent
this year, supported by a recovery in winter sports, growth in
sports apparel and cost efficiency, Kalle Karppinen, an analyst
at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , said in a note to investors today. He
increased his 12-month price target to 13 euros from 11 euros
and reiterated his buy recommendation on the stock. Mika Karppinen, an analyst at Evli Bank Oyj, also increased his price
target to 13.50 euros from 12.50 euros.  Sales reached a record 2.06 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in
2012 and Ebit excluding non-recurring items rose about 1 percent
to 136.5 million euros, the company said yesterday. Amer Sports
said it expects both figures to increase this year after last
year’s “mild” winter.  “The company’s guidance is very careful and we expect them
to upgrade it during the year,” Sauli Vilen and Antti Viljakainen, analysts at Helsinki-based equity-research company
Inderes Oy said in a note. They upgraded their recommendation to
accumulate from reduce, increasing the price target to 12.50
euros from 11 euros. “We expect growth to continue strongly
despite a weak environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
