The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped two basis points to 115 basis
points as of 9:40 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge climbed 2.8 basis points in
January, rising for a second consecutive month, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped three basis
points to 119 as of 11:08 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark is poised for its lowest
close in three days, after declining for a fifth straight month
in January, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.

negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell one basis point to 134
as of 10:09 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG prices.
The measure is headed for its lowest level since August 2011,
CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
