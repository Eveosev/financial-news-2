Life Time Fitness Inc. (LTM)  fell the most
since its market debut in 2004 after the sports-center operator
forecast annual sales and profit that trailed analysts’
estimates amid expenses for opening new locations.  The shares tumbled 22 percent to $39.36 at the close in New
York for the biggest one-day drop since June 2004. The stock
 gained  5.3 percent last year, while the Standard & Poor’s Midcap
Consumer Discretionary Sector Index advanced 22 percent.  Life Time, which also reported preliminary quarterly
results that included a Superstorm Sandy-related charge of 7
cents a share, plans three new centers this year, according to a
statement yesterday. The company, which  has  105 locations in the
U.S. and Canada, also cited expenses for centers opening in
early 2014 and investment in growth initiatives  “We understand LTM’s philosophy of trying to grow the
business with certain ‘non-core’ growth initiatives which will
drive expenses up in the near-term, but won’t necessarily have a
revenue impact for some time,” Steven M. Wieczynski, a Stifel
Financial Corp. analyst, wrote in an investor note. “Certain
investors might not feel the same way,” said Wieczynski, who
 rates  the shares hold.  Earnings for 2013 will be $2.85 to $2.95 a share,
Chanhassen, Minnesota-based Life Time said yesterday after the
 New York  markets closed. That trailed analysts’ average estimate
of $3.17 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue will be $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion, compared to
estimates for $1.24 billion.  Membership last year grew “slightly” less than expected
and acquisition costs were higher, the company said. Fees
probably increased by 10 percent, while memberships rose 1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
