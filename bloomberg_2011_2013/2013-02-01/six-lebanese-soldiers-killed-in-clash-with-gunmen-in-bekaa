Six Lebanese soldiers were killed in
a clash with gunmen after the troops arrested a man wanted in
the March 2011 kidnapping of seven Estonians, said Al-Manar TV,
the Hezbollah-run television network.  The wanted man was also killed in today’s shootout, it
said.  Al-Manar’s correspondent in the Bekaa Valley town of Ersal,
where the clash took place, said calls through mosque
loudspeakers urged the town’s residents to free the wanted man.
The soldiers were later ambushed, leading to the death of three
of them, Al-Manar said.  The Estonians were kidnapped while cycling in eastern
Lebanon and were released four months after their abduction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
