Russian manufacturing rebounded in
January from a 15-month low as an increase in domestic business
helped propel new orders at the fastest pace since March 2011,
HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index advanced to 52.0 in January
from 50.0 in December, HSBC said today in an e-mailed  statement ,
citing data compiled by London-based Markit Economics. A reading
above 50 indicates an improvement in business conditions, while
a result below that suggests a deterioration. Economists
projected a smaller advance to 50.2, according to the median of
five estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Russia , the world’s largest energy exporter, saw growth
slow last year to the weakest pace since a 2009 contraction. The
improvement last month suggests manufacturing is stabilizing,
which may bolster the broader economy, according to  Alexander Morozov , chief economist for Russia at HSBC in Moscow.
Manufacturing led  industrial production  gains for much of 2012.  “The manufacturing sector has rebounded in January after
the bleak results in December,” Morozov said in the statement.
The growth in new orders was “particularly strong” and was
similar to trends before the 2008 crisis, he said.  The  Micex Manufacturing Index (MICEXMNF)  of nine stocks advanced 0.5
percent in January, trailing a 4.9 percent gain for the 50-stock
Micex Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  New business expanded at the quickest pace in 22 months,
primarily led by domestic demand, according the report. New
export business “stabilized” after contracting in December.  Micex Index advanced for a second day, rising 0.3 percent
to 1,550.96 as of 10:48 a.m. in Moscow. The gauge of
manufacturing stocks advanced 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
