The pound fell to a 14-month low
against the euro after an industry report showed U.K.
manufacturing grew less in January than economists forecast,
damping demand for Britain’s currency.  Sterling headed for a fourth weekly loss versus the common
currency as a European report this week showed economic
confidence improved in January, adding to signs the region’s
debt crisis is easing. Royal Bank of  Scotland  Group Plc
suggested investors buy the pound against the euro, betting its
slide is about to end. Gilts rose along with Treasuries after a
report showed the U.S. unemployment rate increased and payrolls
expanded less than analysts forecast in January.  “The pound’s weakness against the euro is likely to
continue,” said Michael Derks, chief strategist at FxPro
Financial Services Ltd. in  London . “The decline is driven by a
combination of both euro and U.K. stories. People are more
optimistic about the euro and the U.K. is now less of a haven,
especially when its economy is moving sideways.”  The pound depreciated 1 percent to 86.44 pence per euro at
3:16 p.m. in London after falling to 86.48 pence, the weakest
level since November 2011. The currency has slumped 1.2 percent
this week. Sterling dropped 0.6 percent to $1.5761.  Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply  said their gauge of U.K. manufacturing output fell to
50.8 this month from a revised 51.2 in December. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a decline to 51. A reading above
50 indicates expansion.  Consumer Sentiment  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the euro-
area climbed to 89.2 in January, the highest since June, from
87.8 in December, the European Commission said Jan. 30.  The pound has weakened 3.9 percent this year, the second-
worst performer after the yen of 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
strengthened 3.1 percent and the dollar dropped 0.5 percent.  Sterling pared losses against the euro after the  European
Central Bank  said financial institutions will repay 3.5 billion
euros ($4.77 billion) of three-year loans next week that they
had borrowed through the so-called Longer-Term Refinancing
Operations, down from 137.2 billion euros at their first
opportunity to pay back the funds this week.  The ECB, led by President  Mario Draghi , will meet on Feb. 7
to set interest rates. Policy makers will keep their benchmark
rate unchanged at record-low 0.75 percent, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  The  Bank of England  will maintain its asset purchase
facility at 375 billion pounds and the main  interest rate  at 0.5
percent the same day, separate Bloomberg surveys show.  RBS Prediction  Royal Bank of Scotland said Draghi’s comments at next
week’s policy meeting may temporarily halt the euro’s advance.  “Recently the euro has rallied on LTRO withdrawal” and
measures to contain the region’s debt crisis, Greg Gibbs, a
senior currency strategist at RBS in  Singapore , wrote in a note
to clients. “The risk is now that the market has built all this
in and that Draghi may shift to noting risks to the economic
outlook.”  Gilts advanced, reversing an earlier decline, after Labor
Department figures showed the U.S jobless rate rose to 7.9
percent from 7.8 percent and employers added 157,000 jobs last
month following a revised 196,000 increase in December. Median
estimates in Bloomberg surveys forecast the  unemployment rate  to
hold at 7.8 percent and for payrolls to increase by 165,000.  The 10-year gilt yield dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.08 percent. The 1.75 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 advanced 0.1, or 1 pound per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 97.10. The rate earlier climbed to 2.12
percent. It was little changed on the week.  Gilts have lost 1.9 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds dropped
1.8 percent and Treasuries fell 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
