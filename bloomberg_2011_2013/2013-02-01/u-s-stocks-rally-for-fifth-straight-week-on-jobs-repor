U.S. stocks  rallied for a fifth week
as data showing improvement in the labor market and better-than-
estimated earnings sent benchmark indexes toward record highs.  Caterpillar Inc. jumped 4.1 percent after forecasting
earnings growth in the second half as the world economy
improves.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  added 18 percent on a 20-fold
profit gain. Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. rose 4.4
percent as telephone companies led gains among  10 groups  in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. United Parcel Service Inc. declined
3 percent as the world’s largest package-delivery company gave a
profit outlook that trailed estimates.  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 1,513.17 for the week. The
benchmark equity gauge is up 6.1 percent  for the year . The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  rallied 113.81 points, or 0.8 percent,
to 14,009.79. The gauge closed above 14,000 for the first time
since 2007 and is 1.1 percent below the all-time record it
reached in October 2007.  “The January jobs data came in line with expectations but
the revisions were really the silver lining,” Joseph Tanious, a
New York-based global market strategist for JPMorgan Funds,
which oversees $400 billion, said in a telephone interview.
“There were fairly meaningful revisions to the prior months,
suggesting that the labor market is in fact continuing to heal.
That reinforces the belief that the U.S. economy is growing.”  The  S&P 500  jumped 1 percent on the last trading day after
a report showed U.S. payrolls rose 157,000 last month following
a revised 196,000 advance in the prior month and a 247,000 surge
in November. The hiring gains indicated the labor market was
making progress even as lawmakers quarreled over the  federal
budget  at the end of 2012. Among other economic reports,
manufacturing in the U.S. expanded more than forecast in
January, reaching a nine-month high.  Shrinking Economy  Equities slumped earlier in the week as data showed the
U.S. economy shrank at a 0.1 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, the worst performance since the second quarter of 2009.
The  Federal Reserve  said it will keep purchasing securities at
the rate of $85 billion a month.  The S&P 500 has more than doubled from a 12-year low in
2009, trading about 3.3 percent below its record high, as
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has unleashed the power of the central
bank to buy unlimited amounts of Treasury and mortgage-backed
securities to keep  interest rates  low and spur growth.  The benchmark index ended last month with its best January
return since 1997, at 5.2 percent including dividends, as
fourth-quarter earnings beat estimates and U.S. lawmakers forged
a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic spending
cuts and tax increases. Of the 254 S&P 500 that have  posted
results , 73 percent exceeded analysts’ profit estimates and 65
percent topped sales projections, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  ‘More Clarity’  “We’ve gotten a lot more clarity on important things that
we didn’t have a short while ago, as it relates to the  U.S.
economy , the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling, fourth-quarter
earnings,” Tanious said. “As you continue to peel away that
uncertainty and markets become more comfortable, you create an
environment where risk assets can do quite well.”  Caterpillar gained 4.1 percent to $99.49 for the week. The
largest maker of construction and mining equipment forecast 2013
earnings of $7 to $9 a share. The Peoria, Illinois-based company
forecast that world economic growth will be weak initially and
improve as 2013 unfolds to beat last year’s growth of 2.3
percent. Caterpillar posted record profit for last year of
$8.64.  Valero surged 18 percent to $44.85. The world’s largest
independent refiner by processing capacity rose to the highest
level since June 2008 after reporting a 20-fold increase in
fourth-quarter profit driven by cheap U.S. crude.  Verizon, AT&T  Telephone companies jumped 3.6 percent as a group. Verizon
rallied 4.4 percent for the  biggest gain  in the Dow to $44.56.
AT&T posted the second-largest advance, rising 4.4 percent to
$35.51.  Consumer-staple stocks added 1.2 percent for the third-
largest rally.  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  climbed 3.7 percent to
$75.92. Utility stocks were fourth, rising 1.1 percent.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  rallied 2.3 percent to $27.63. The world’s
largest drugmaker reported revenue of $15.1 billion,  beating  the
estimate of $14.4 billion in its biggest positive surprise in
five quarters. Zoetis Inc., the animal-health company owned by
Pfizer, surged 19 percent to $31.01 in its debut on the last day
of the week. Zoetis raised $2.24 billion in its initial public
offering, the biggest in the U.S. since Facebook Inc.’s last
year.  Last Refinery  Hess Corp. jumped 16 percent to $68.21. The  oil company 
said it will close its last refinery and sell its oil terminals
after disclosing billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Associates LP
planned to buy an $800 million stake and seek board seats. Hess
also reported a $566 million profit for the fourth quarter,
compared with a $131 million net loss a year earlier.  D.R. Horton Inc. rose 7.3 percent to $23.35. The largest
U.S. homebuilder by volume reported that earnings more than
doubled in the fiscal first quarter, as low  mortgage rates  and a
shrinking inventory of existing residences on the market are
fueling sales of new houses.  Merck & Co. lost 3.8 percent to $41.83 for the biggest
decline in the Dow. The second-largest U.S. drugmaker  forecast  a
decline in profit this year as generic competition to its top-
selling drug Singulair cuts into results and research setbacks
keep the company from getting new medicines to market.  Constrained Growth  UPS declined 3 percent to $79.97. The Atlanta-based
company’s growth is constrained by a sluggish worldwide economy
and disputes over the U.S. debt ceiling that erode shipping
demand and confidence, Chief Executive Officer Scott Davis said.
Investors and analysts use the company as an economic gauge
because it handles goods as varied as auto parts and
pharmaceuticals.  Dow Chemical Co. dropped 5.8 percent to $32.59. The largest
U.S. chemical maker by sales reported fourth-quarter earnings
that missed analysts’ estimates as sales fell in  Europe  and
Chinese growth slowed.  Facebook Inc. slid 5.7 percent to $29.73. The operator of
the biggest social network posted a 79 percent plunge in fourth-
quarter profit as operating expenses jumped 82 percent, raising
concern that margins will come under pressure.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  erased 3 percent to $19.76. The largest U.S.
Web portal gave first-quarter and full-year sales forecasts that
fell short of some  analysts’ projections . The disappointing
forecasts underscore the challenge Chief Executive Officer
 Marissa Mayer  faces in display advertising, an area where Yahoo
lags behind Google Inc. and Facebook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
