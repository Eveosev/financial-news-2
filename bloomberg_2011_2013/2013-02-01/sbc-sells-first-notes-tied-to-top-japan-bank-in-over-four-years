HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  sold the first
structured notes tied to the credit of Japan’s largest bank in
more than four years, after Moody’s Investors Service raised its
outlook on the nation’s lenders.  HSBC’s Middle East branch sold $10 million dollars of notes
linked to the debt of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. on Jan.
16, the first offering tied to the lender since July 2008
according to Bloomberg data. The bank is a unit of  Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , the largest Japanese lender.  Moody’s raised its outlook for Japan’s banking industry to
stable from negative in November in its first upgrade since
2008, citing stronger capital buffers. The cost of insuring
bonds of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ dropped to 92.6 basis
points as of Jan. 31 from 158.3 at the end of 2011, according to
data provider CMA.  Issuers of credit-linked notes use the securities to hedge
against possible credit events and pay the buyers for accepting
the risks as long as the underlying assets don’t default.
Moody’s assigns Aa3, its fourth-highest rating, to the bank’s
long-term debt.  The five-year Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ notes pay
quarterly coupons at 2 percent plus 3-month dollar  London
interbank offered rates , which were at 0.298 percent as of Jan.
31, according to Bloomberg data.  HSBC also sold $10 million of notes tied to the debt of
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., a unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316) , the second-largest Japanese lender by
market value, Bloomberg data show. The securities pay a 2.05
percent premium to 3-month dollar Libor.  Adam Harper , a Hong Kong-based spokesman for HSBC, declined
to comment on the reasons for issuance of the notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
