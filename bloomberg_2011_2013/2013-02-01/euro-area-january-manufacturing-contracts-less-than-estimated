Euro-area  manufacturing output 
contracted less than estimated in January, adding to signs the
currency bloc’s economy is beginning to emerge from a  recession .  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area rose to
47.9 from 46.1 in December, London-based Markit Economics said
today. That’s above an  initial estimate  of 47.5 on Jan. 24. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction. The gauge has been below
50 for 18 months.  Euro-area economic confidence in January rose to highest
level since June, with sentiment among manufacturers also at a
seven-month high. The currency area’s economy will stagnate in
the first three months of this year after contracting for a
third successive quarter at the end of 2012, according to the
median of 26 economists’ forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  SAP AG, the biggest maker of business-management software,
on Jan. 23 forecast at least a 12 percent gain in full-year
earnings as the company adds Internet-based programs to attract
users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
