Bruce Berkowitz , named by  Morningstar
Inc. (MORN)  as the domestic stock-fund manager of the decade in January
2010, said he loaded up on stocks such as  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
when they were “priced to die.”  Investors got a buying opportunity during and after the
credit crunch when financial firms fell to levels that implied
they would fail, Berkowitz said today during a question-and-
answer session at the Columbia Student Investment Management
Association Conference in New York.  Berkowitz is the managing member of Miami-based Fairholme
Capital Management LLC. His top-performing Fairholme Fund was
closed to new investors this week after it posted its best
performance in a decade for 2012. The fund’s largest stakes have
included  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  and Bank of America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
