Beate Zschaepe, a 38-year-old member
of the neo-Nazi cell NSU, has to stand trial on charges of
killing 10 people as part of a plan to terrorize minorities and
force them to leave the country, a German court ruled.  Four supporters will be tried alongside Zschaepe for
forming a terrorism group, the Munich Higher Regional Court said
today. The cell’s activities came to light in 2011 when NSU
members Uwe Boehnhardt and Uwe Mundlos committed suicide in a
camping van in the central German city of Eisenach.  A trial hasn’t been scheduled and isn’t expected to begin
before April, the court said in an e-mailed statement.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has called the crimes a “disgrace
for  Germany .” Authorities have struggled to explain the failure
to uncover the three-person cell that allegedly committed crimes
across the country for over a decade, including 15 robberies to
finance the group.  The chief of Germany’s counter-intelligence quit amid the
scandal, which revealed that files detailing government
surveillance of the group were destroyed.  The murders took place throughout the country, in cities
such as Nuremberg, Munich, Hamburg and Dortmund, and targeted
men with immigrant backgrounds. Police have also tied the NSU to
a bomb attack in Cologne in 2004 that injured more than a dozen
people, mostly of Turkish origin.  Wolfgang Stahl, Zschaepe’s lawyer, didn’t immediately
return a call requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
