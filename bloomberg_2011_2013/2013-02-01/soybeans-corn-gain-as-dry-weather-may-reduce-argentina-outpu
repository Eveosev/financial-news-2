Soybeans rallied to a six-week high
and corn rose for a fifth straight day on speculation that warm,
dry weather will erode yields in  Argentina , increasing demand
for tightening U.S. supplies.  Most fields in Argentina were dry in the past 24 hours, and
the main growing region will be warm and dry for another 10
days,  T-Storm Weather LLC  in  Chicago  said in a report to
clients. Since Dec. 20, Argentina has been drier than last year,
when it had a drought, the forecaster said. U.S. inventories of
corn and soybeans fell Dec. 1 to the lowest since 2003, after
drought cut output for a third straight year.  “The markets are reacting to the potential for smaller
crops in Argentina,” David Smoldt, a vice president at INTL
FCStone Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview. “U.S. corn and soybean supplies are extremely tight,
and there is no room for additional exports.”  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 1.1 percent to
$14.84 a bushel at 10:23 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching $14.865, the highest since Dec. 18. Prices are up
3 percent since Jan. 25, heading for a fourth straight weekly
gain.  Corn futures for March delivery advanced 0.5 percent to
$7.44 a bushel in Chicago, heading for the longest rally since
Jan. 16. Earlier, the grain touched $7.4625, the highest since
Dec. 7.  Prices also rose on speculation that China, the world’s
biggest consumer of grain, will increase imports to curtail
rising domestic prices, Smoldt said. Corn futures on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange  have gained 7.2 percent since Oct. 1 after
harvesting a record crop. That’s equal to $10.08 a bushel, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  “Importing products that China needs helps to stabilize
domestic prices”  Chen Xiwen , deputy head of the Central Rural
Work Leading Group under the State Council, said at a press
conference today.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
