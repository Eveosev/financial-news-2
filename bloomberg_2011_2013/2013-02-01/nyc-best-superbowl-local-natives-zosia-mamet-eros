Williamsburg will be filled with the gloriously melodic pop of

men, cruelly piercing the heart with love. During the Classical
era he was represented as a winged youth in flight.  In the Hellenistic period (323-31 B.C.), the god was
represented as a baby, and one of the most popular icons became
Eros asleep.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art has put together a show
around its own fine bronze statue of the sleeping god, also
including urns, mosaics, jewelry and other Eros-decorated
objects.  “Sleeping Eros” runs through June 23 at the Met, 1000 Fifth
Ave. Information: +1-212-535-7710;  http://www.metmuseum.org .  It’s the 100th anniversary of Grand Central Terminal.
