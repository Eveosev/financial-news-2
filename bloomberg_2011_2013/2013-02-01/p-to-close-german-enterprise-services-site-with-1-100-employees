Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the world’s
largest personal-computer maker, plans to shutter a German site,
slashing 1,100 jobs as part of a cost-cut plan aimed at
offsetting sluggish demand for hardware and services.  The local unit’s supervisory board today decided to close
the site in Ruesselsheim near Frankfurt, which provides
enterprise services such as information-technology consulting
and data-center management, the IG Metall union said in an e-
mailed statement. Patrik Edlund, a spokesman for HP in Germany,
didn’t immediately have a comment when reached by Bloomberg News.  HP, based in  Palo Alto , California, in September extended
its job-reduction program to 29,000, including 8,000 in the
enterprise services unit. Volker Stichter, head of the
Ruesselsheim works council, said the 1,100 workers affected are
part of the earlier announced program.  “It’s not like we’re sitting on our hands here,” Stichter
said in an interview, adding that the cuts amount to a quarter
of HP’s enterprise-services workforce in Germany. “I’m not sure
we can adequately handle our customers after this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
