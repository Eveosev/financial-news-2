South Korean corporate bond sales
dwindled last month in the slowest start in seven years after
the currency’s 8.3 percent rise against the  U.S. dollar  in 2012
hampered the economy, bolstering expectations for further
declines in borrowing costs.  Issuance fell 73 percent to 2.26 trillion won ($2.1
billion) in January compared with the previous year and 50
percent less than the monthly average for 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  LG Household & Health Care Ltd. (051900) ,
 Asia ’s second-biggest maker of household products by market
value, led sales with 500 billion won of three- and five-year
debt, the data show.  The won surged the most among Asia’s 11 major currencies in
2012, crimping economic expansion and opening the door for
central bank stimulus, which could drive company debt yields
lower. Export growth from Asia’s fourth-biggest economy may be
capped this year as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
campaign to drive down the yen makes his nation’s cars and
electronic goods relatively cheaper.  “The trend in the won is a factor that enhances the
likelihood of another rate cut,” said Byun Jeong Hye, a credit
analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp., the fifth-biggest
underwriter of won-denominated bonds last year. “Issuance will
probably increase in February and March compared with January.”  Byun predicts the benchmark  seven-day repurchase rate  will
be cut in April. Yields on three-year corporate notes rated at
AA- fell 16 basis points to 3.13 percent last month, the biggest
monthly decrease since August and near the lowest in  Korea 
Financial Investment Association data going back to 2000.
Average yields fell to a low of 3.12 percent on Jan. 25.  Borrowing Costs  The  Bank of Korea  held borrowing costs unchanged at 2.75
percent last month, following a 25-basis point reduction in
October. The central bank will reduce the rate by a further 25
basis points in the second quarter, according to the median
estimate of 12 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Overseas shipments by exporters such as Samsung Electronics
Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. account for nearly half of Korea’s
gross domestic product.  “This currency trend, which will have a negative impact on
 South Korea ’s economy, is the main reason why the bond rates
aren’t able to rebound,” said Hwang Won Ha, a Seoul-based
credit analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co., the securities
unit of Hyundai Motor Group. “It seems companies are hurrying
to issue bonds in the following months as there’s expectation
that the economy will improve in the second half of the year.”  Growth Forecasts  South Korea’s economy expanded less than analysts forecast
in the fourth quarter.  Gross domestic product  grew 1.5 percent
from a year earlier, unchanged from the expansion in the third
quarter, the central bank said Jan. 24. The median estimate of
12 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was for a 1.8 percent
expansion.  The central bank lowered its forecast for the nation’s 2013
growth last month to 2.8 percent from an October estimate of 3.2
percent. The economy will expand 3.8 percent next year,
according to the projection. Lee Sang Jae, a senior economist at
Hyundai Securities Co. in  Seoul , said that an interest-rate cut
is possible if growth falters on weak sentiment and a strong
currency.  LG Household & Health Care sold 210 billion won of January
2018 bonds priced to yield 3.2 percent and 290 billion won of
January 2016 notes paying 3.1 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Seoul-based company sold three-year
securities in January 2012 to yield 3.92 percent, the data show.  Lotte Engineering  GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360) , the only issuer this
week, sold 320 billion won of February 2016 notes priced to
yield 3.53 percent, and 60 billion won of February 2018
debentures paying 3.66 percent, according to Bloomberg data. The
Seoul-based company last sold bonds in October, and has 1.6
trillion won of debt  outstanding , the data show.  South Korean companies sold 54.8 trillion won of bonds last
year, below the 57.3 trillion won of issuance in 2011, according
to the data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lotte Engineering & Construction Co. and SK Engineering &
Construction Co. are among companies planning to sell bonds in
coming weeks, according to preliminary data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
