The global sugar surplus will be 51
percent smaller in the 2013-14 season compared with a year
earlier as lower prices result in a drop in production,
according to researcher Kingsman SA, owned by  McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP)   Sugar supplies will be 5.6 million metric tons higher than
demand in the 12 months starting Oct. 1, the researcher, based
in Lausanne, Switzerland, said in a report e-mailed today. That
compares with 11.5 million tons in 2012-13. Production will
slide 1.8 percent to 178.5 million tons in the period from a
year earlier, according to the report.  While production in Brazil’s center south, the main growing
region of the world’s biggest producer, will climb to a record
in the 2013-14 season that starts there in April, output is set
to fall in other countries including India, the second-biggest
grower and largest consumer, Kingsman said.  Russia , Ukraine, the
U.S. and  Mexico  will also see declines, it said.  “Given low world and domestic prices, we expect production
to decline in a number of other countries as farmers search for
better returns elsewhere,” Kingsman said, adding that output is
forecast to decline in “some of the more expensive producers.”  On a national crop year basis, which starts when harvesting
begins in each of the countries, the surplus will be 39 percent
smaller in 2013-14 at 6.28 million tons, the researcher
estimated. The excess supplies represent 3.64 percent of
consumption, down from 6.07 percent in 2012-13, it said. Sugar
fell 39 percent in the last two years and is down another 3.5
percent in 2013. A third year of price declines would be the
longest slump since 1992, data on Bloomberg showed.  Global Consumption  “Although that sounds a move in the right direction,
surpluses don’t disappear: stocks accumulate and the can just
gets kicked down the road a little,” Kingsman said. Production
declines were “not enough to prevent another surplus.”  Global sugar consumption will gain 1.6 percent to 172.9
million tons in the 12 months starting Oct. 1, according to
Kingsman’s estimates. Demand in 2012-13 will be 170.2 million
tons, down from a previous forecast of 170.9 million tons,
because of “disappointing demand growth” in the European Union
and switching to non-sugar sweeteners in other countries, it
said.  Sugar production in  India  will drop to 22.25 million tons
in 2013-14, down from 24.24 million tons in the current season,
according to the report. Output will decline partly due to dry
weather in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, which
together account for 45 percent of output.  Water Shortages  “Several districts in Maharashtra and North Karnataka are
still suffering from a severe shortage of water and plantings
are reported to be sharply lower as farmers shift to less water-
intensive cane,” Kingsman said. “Uttar Pradesh is still an
open book, but despite the possibility of rising cane payment
arrears, cane still pays better than other crops.”  In Russia, once the world’s biggest raw sugar importer,
output will slide to 5 million tons from 5.2 million tons in
2012-13, while production in Ukraine will be 2 million tons from
2.4 million tons, Kingsman estimates. Both nations will reduce
the planted area. Mexico and the U.S. will see a “major drop”
in production after a surplus this season. Mexican millers will
make 5.76 million tons in 2013-14 from 6.4 million tons now. In
the U.S., production will be 7.5 million tons from 8.2 million
tons in the current season, according to the report.  Output Gains  The sugar-cane crop in  Brazil ’s center south will climb to
575 million tons in the 2013-14 season that starts there in
April, according to Kingsman, an all-time high. That compares
with 531.9 million tons in 2012-13, data from industry group
Unica showed. Sugar production will be 35.5 million tons,
Kingsman estimated. This week’s announcement of a gasoline price
increase in Brazil and the government’s decision to boost the
amount of ethanol blended into gasoline to 25 percent in May
from 20 percent now may still change the amount of cane millers
direct to sugar, Kingsman said.  “There is still time before the center south Brazil
harvest for the ethanol-sugar equation to move in favor of
ethanol,” it said. Both the sweetener and the biofuel are made
from raw material sugar cane in the South America nation.  Millers in  Thailand , the world’s second-biggest exporter,
will make 10.4 million tons of sugar in 2013-14, according to
Kingsman. That compares with a forecast for 9.9 million tons
this season. Output will gain because of processing capacity
expansion, the researcher said. Sugar production in  Australia 
will rise 5.6 percent in 2013-14 to 4.65 million tons.  China’s Production  In  China , last season’s  biggest buyer , production will be
similar to the 15 million tons forecast for this year as sugar
cane is still a profitable crop for farmers, Kingsman said. EU
output will gain to 17.5 million tons in 2013-14, a 761,000 tons
increase from the 2012-13 forecast, it said.  The supply and demand outlook could still change if millers
in Brazil opt to favor ethanol and Northern Hemisphere farmers
change their planting intentions, Kingsman said. Unfavorable
weather could also change the current picture.  “The world doesn’t need an additional 5 million tons of
sugar in the warehouse,” Kingsman said. “The sugar market has
been remarkably inefficient recently in sending the correct
price signals, but that situation will not last forever.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
