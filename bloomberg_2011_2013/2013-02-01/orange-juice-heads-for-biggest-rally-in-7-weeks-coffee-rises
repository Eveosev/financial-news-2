Orange juice  headed for the largest
weekly gain since mid-December on signs that a crop disease will
reduce output in Florida. Coffee, cotton and sugar also
increased, while cocoa was steady.  The bacterial disease, called citrus greening, has already
ruined 12 percent of the crop in Florida, the world’s top citrus
grower after Brazil,  Shawn Hackett , the president of  Boynton
Beach , Florida-based Hackett Financial Advisors Inc., said in an
e-mail. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its forecast for
the state’s crop twice since October to 142 million boxes, down
3.1 percent from a year earlier.  “It has already been very bad, and it has a long-term tail
to it for many more years,” Hackett said.  Orange juice for March delivery jumped 1.5 percent to
$1.2145 a pound at 11:32 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
heading for the sixth straight gain. A close at that level would
leave prices up 7.1 percent this week, the most since Dec. 14.  Also in  New York , arabica-coffee futures for March delivery
advanced 0.6 percent to $1.4785 a pound. An industry group in
Honduras, the biggest grower in Central America, yesterday cut
its forecast for shipments by 20 percent after a fungus damaged
crops.  Cotton futures climbed 0.4 percent to 83.31 cents a pound
on ICE. Prices surged 10 percent last month, the most since
February 2011.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery gained 0.8 percent to
18.93 cents a pound in New York, while cocoa futures for March
delivery were slid less than 0.1 percent to $2,204 a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
