Ag Processing Inc., a grains
processor, said it shut operations at its ethanol plant in
Hastings,  Nebraska , because of high corn prices.  The plant was idled today, and the company will evaluate
market conditions to determine when it will restart, Omaha,
Nebraska-based Ag Processing said in a statement on its website.  Before Ag Processing’s announcement, 18 ethanol plants had
been idled since June as drought in the Midwest scorched and
shrank corn crops and raised costs to make the grain into
ethanol, according to data from the Renewable Fuels Association,
a Washington-based trade group.  “Our facility, like other corn processing plans in the
Midwest, continues to experience negative margins due to higher
corn prices driven by ongoing drought conditions and lower
ethanol prices,” Ag Processing Chief Executive Officer and
General Manager Keith Spackler said in the statement.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery has risen 14
percent in the past year to $2.469 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. That compares to a 15 percent jump in corn to $7.36 a
bushel.  The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, is minus 20 cents a
gallon, down from minus 22 cents yesterday, assuming one bushel
makes at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
