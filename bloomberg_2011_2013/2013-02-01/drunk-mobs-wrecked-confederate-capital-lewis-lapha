Robert E. Lee’s army was being forced
to withdraw from the Confederate capital of Richmond,  Virginia ,
by the approaching forces of Ulysses Grant.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The residents panicked, packed up what they could carry and
tried to flee through clogged streets, closely followed by
looters.  When warehouses were broken into, people were outraged to
find plenty of food and clothing stowed away by speculators, who
had created the shortages from which most suffered.  As the news spread, stores of liquor were liberated by the
angry townsfolk, and while fires devoured the capital, drunken
mobs shattered windows and wrecked everything in their path.  I spoke with H.W. Brands, author of “The Man Who Saved the
Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace,” on the following
topics:  1. Brilliant General  2. Visualize Battlefield  3. War’s Logistics  4. Financial Acumen  5. Memoirs  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
