Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
businesses and high-end homes, advanced the most in six months
after fourth-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates and the
company announced a $1.3 billion share repurchase plan.  Chubb climbed 3.2 percent to $82.89 at 4:01 p.m. in  New
York , a record-high closing price. Operating profit, which
excludes some investment results, was 16 cents a share, the
Warren, New Jersey-based firm said yesterday in a statement,
beating by 62 cents the average estimate of 21 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  The insurer said that 2013 operating profit will probably
be in the range of $6.40 to $6.80 a share, compared with the
average estimate of $6.26 in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  “The combination of Chubb’s brand equity, the stability of
its earnings results and the transparency of its disclosure
augur for a premium among its peers,” Josh Shanker, a research
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said in a research note today in
which he upgraded the insurer to buy. He estimated the company
will post an operating profit of $6.40 a share in 2013.  Full-year profit for 2012 fell 7.9 percent to $1.55 billion
from $1.68 billion, the firm said. Chubb’s fourth-quarter
investment income slid to $365 million from $391 million a year
earlier as lower  interest rates  limited what the company earned
on its municipal-bond and corporate-debt portfolios.  The latest repurchase plan replaces a program announced
last year that authorized buying back as much as $1.2 billion in
stock. About $979 million was repurchased under last year’s
program, the company said.  Chief Executive Officer John Finnegan said he plans to
complete the latest buyback plan by January of next year.  Chubb has gained 22 percent in the last 12 months, compared
with the 23 percent  advance  of the 81-company Standard & Poor’s
500 Financials Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
