The rand strengthened for a second
day after U.S. jobs data added to evidence of a recovery in the
world’s biggest economy, boosting the outlook for  South Africa ’s
commodity exports.  The rand gained as much as 1.1 percent to 8.8545 per
dollar, the strongest level since Jan. 23. It traded 0.9 percent
up at 8.8742 as of 4:04 p.m. in Johannesburg, bringing its
advance this week to 0.8 percent, the first weekly gain in five.
Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 dropped
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.30 percent for
a decline of nine basis points this week.  Hiring in the U.S. increased in January after accelerating
more than previously estimated at the end of 2012, evidence the
U.S. labor market was making progress even as lawmakers
quarreled over the  federal budget . Commodity prices rallied and
stocks rose as investor appetite for riskier assets improved.
Metals and other commodities account for about 60 percent of
South Africa’s exports.  “There was a good, solid, non-farm payrolls number out of
the U.S., and that lifted risk” appetite, Ion de Vleeschauwer,
the Johannesburg-based chief dealer at Bidvest Bank, said by
phone. “Some players decided to take profit on long-dollar
positions.”  Payrolls rose 157,000 following a revised 196,000 advance
in the prior month and a 247,000 surge in November, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington .  China Manufacturing  The rand was also buoyed by reports showing manufacturing
in  China , the biggest buyer of South African raw materials,
expanded in January, boosting prices of commodities including
copper and nickel. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw
materials climbed as much as 0.6 percent.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.4 in January compared
with 50.6 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in
Beijing as they more than tripled the number of companies
surveyed. A separate gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics covering fewer businesses rose to a two-year high of
52.3 from 51.5. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  “Chinese figures this morning were mixed, but still
consistent with a mild acceleration in the economy,”  John Cairns , a currency strategist at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
