Six Angolan crude cargoes for loading
in March, about 11 percent of scheduled volumes, still haven’t
been sold, five traders who participate in the market said.  That’s fewer than normal at this stage in the month, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is confidential. Unsold grades for export next month
include two shipments of Kissanje and one each of Cabinda,
Girassol, Kuito and Nemba, they said. The size of the lots
ranges from 920,000 barrels to 1 million barrels.  Five February cargoes hadn’t been sold as of Jan. 9, three
traders said at the time.  Angola plans to export 56 cargoes totaling 1.74 million
barrels a day of crude in March, compared with 49 shipments for
February, according to a final shipping schedule obtained by
 Bloomberg News  on Jan. 28.  Benchmark Cabinda grade was today 41 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent, the North Sea benchmark used to price more
than half of the world’s oil, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose to a premium of 55 cents on Jan. 2, the
highest in almost four months.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
