Louis Dreyfus Holding BV’s Brazilian
sugar unit,  Biosev SA (BSEV3) , may resume an initial public offering
amid speculation sugar prices will rise and after local stocks
entered a  bull market .  Shareholders of the Sao Paulo-based company will meet Feb.
19 to vote on whether to sell shares after scrapping plans for a
1.14 billion-real ($570 million) IPO last year, according to a
statement published in Sao Paulo state’s official gazette today.
An official for Biosev, who asked not to be named because of
company policy, declined to comment further.  Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index entered a bull market on
Jan. 3, after rising 21 percent from last year’s low on June 5
on expectations stimulus from central banks in industrialized
countries from  Japan  to the U.S. will revive growth.  Raw sugar prices in New York are set to rise 9 percent to
an average 20.5 cents in the fourth quarter, the mean of nine
bank estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Prices will rise after
posting the biggest two-year drop since 1999.  Biosev, Brazil’s second-largest sugar miller, canceled its
IPO in August, citing market conditions. The company had planned
to use proceeds to repay debt and fund an expansion, it said in
June. Louis Dreyfus, based in Amsterdam, owns 66 percent of
Biosev through three holding companies, it said May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
