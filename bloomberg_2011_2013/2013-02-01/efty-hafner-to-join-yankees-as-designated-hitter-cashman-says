Travis Hafner will join the  New York
Yankees  as a designated hitter, General Manager  Brian Cashman 
said today.  The left-handed power hitter was bought out by the
Cleveland Indians in October after 10 seasons with the Major
League Baseball franchise. Cashman said today in a radio
interview on 98.7 FM ESPN New York that Hafner would join the
Yankees.  Cashman gave no details of the agreement. The New York
Times reported today that the one-year deal will be worth
roughly $2 million in base salary plus performance incentives.  Hafner, 35, has hit .278 with 201 home runs and 694 runs
batted in over 11 major league seasons, the first as a member of
the Texas Rangers. He hit more than 20 home runs in four
straight seasons from 2004 to 2007, but hasn’t reached the
milestone since.  Hafner hit .228 with 12 home runs and 34 RBIs last year.
He’s played more than 95 games just once in the past five
seasons while battling back and knee injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
