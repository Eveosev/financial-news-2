Swiss  manufacturing  output expanded
for the first time in 17 months in January, adding to signs that
the economy is stabilizing.  The procure.ch Purchasing Managers’ Index advanced to 52.5
from a revised 49.2 in December, when adjusted for seasonal
swings,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said. That’s the first reading
above 50, signaling expansion, since August 2011. Economists
forecast an increase to 50.5, the median of 10 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Simultaneously with a depreciation of the Swiss franc
against the euro since the start of the year, “industry appears
to have finally passed the trough,” Zurich-based Credit Suisse
said today in an e-mailed statement.  A measure of Swiss manufacturers’ output rose 6.7 points to
56.3 in January, today’s report showed. A gauge of order
backlogs increased 3 points to 57.9, and an indicator of
employment advanced to 48.1, Credit Suisse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
