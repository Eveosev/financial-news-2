U.S. stock futures extended gains
after a government report showed hiring increased in January
after accelerating more than previously estimated at the end
2012.  S&P 500 futures expiring in March gained 0.5 percent to
1,500 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York .  Payrolls rose 157,000 following a revised 196,000 advance
in the prior month and a 247,000 surge in November, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The revisions
added a total of 127,000 jobs to the employment count in
November and December. The jobless rate increased to 7.9 percent
from 7.8 percent.  The S&P 500 has lost 0.3 percent this week, slipping from a
five-year high, as a report showed U.S. gross domestic product
unexpectedly shrank in the fourth quarter.  Including dividends, the benchmark index rallied 5.2
percent last month for its best January return since 1997,
leading global stocks higher and beating bonds, commodities and
currencies. About $2.6 trillion was added to the value of
equities worldwide last month as earnings from companies
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. beat estimates and U.S.
lawmakers forged a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of
automatic spending cuts and tax increases.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
