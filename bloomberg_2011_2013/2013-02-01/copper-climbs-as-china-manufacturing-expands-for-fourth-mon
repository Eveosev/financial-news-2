Copper advanced, set for a weekly
gain, as data showed manufacturing in  China  expanded for a
fourth consecutive month, fueling optimism that demand for the
metal may improve in the world’s largest user.  Metal for delivery in three months climbed as much as 0.7
percent to $8,223 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $8,187.75 at 10:42 a.m. in  Shanghai . It is
poised for a 2 percent gain this week. Copper for delivery in
March on the Comex fell 0.2 percent to $3.726 a pound.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.4 in January, the
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said as they more than tripled the number of
companies surveyed to 3,000. The reading compares with the 51
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 33 analysts and
50.6 in December. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.  “The data is not that bad,” Wu Jianjian, an analyst at
Yongan Futures Co., said by phone from Hangzhou. “A relative
bullish  market sentiment  is keeping copper in the uptrend.”  A separate report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economic showed the manufacturing PMI at 52.3 last month, the
highest in two years.  The May contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.5
percent to 59,380  yuan  ($9,544) a ton. On the LME, aluminum and
tin were little changed, lead and zinc fell, while nickel rose.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
