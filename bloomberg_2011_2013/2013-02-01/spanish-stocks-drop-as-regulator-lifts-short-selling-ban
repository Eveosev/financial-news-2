Spanish stocks  dropped, extending the
benchmark  IBEX 35 (IBEX)  Index biggest-weekly selloff in four months,
after the country’s market regulator lifted a six-month ban on
short selling.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , the nation’s biggest bank, retreated
2.3 percent.  Bankia SA (BKIA) , the lender that received the largest
government bailout, sank 12 percent. Fomento de Construcciones &
Contratas SA led a selloff by construction companies, falling
9.1 percent.  Acciona (ANA)  SA plunged 13 percent.  The benchmark IBEX 35 fell 1.6 percent to 8,229.7 at the
close in  Madrid , extending their slide this week to 5.7 percent.
The gauge had rallied 35 percent through yesterday after Spanish
regulator, CNMV, imposed short-selling restrictions on July 23,
citing “extreme volatility” in markets.  “The market is likely to correct in the short term after
the strong run seen since last summer,” Rui Mota Guedes, an
analyst at CA Cheuvreux in Paris, wrote in a report today. The
removal of restrictions “is positive news for investors and the
market as it should increase market liquidity.”  The  yield  on benchmark Spanish government bonds has fallen
to 5.21 percent from 7.62 percent on July 24 as concern about
the euro-region debt crisis faded and the country’s banks took
steps to repair their balance sheets. Spanish lenders have been
booking costs to comply with government orders to recognize
losses on real estate that piled up on their balance sheets as
Spain’s property boom turned to bust.  Growth Seeds  After implementing the deepest austerity measures in
decades, Spain “is sowing the seeds of growth,” Economy
Minister Luis de Guindos said at a discussion forum in Davos,
Switzerland, last week. The country is “fully on track to grow
again,” he said.  Santander slid 2.3 percent to 6.04 euros today. The shares
have tumbled 7.7 percent this week, the biggest drop since July.  Bankia, which was ejected from the IBEX 35 on Jan. 2,
retreated 12 percent to 45 euro cents.  Bankinter SA (BKT)  slipped 3.2
percent to 3.87 euros.  FCC fell 9.1 percent to 9.05 euros, extending the stock’s
decline this week to 18 percent, its biggest decline since 1992.
Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA, Spain’s largest
construction company, lost 2.1 percent to 17.30 euros, while
 Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  retreated 3.8 percent to 1.63 euros.  Acciona plunged 13 percent to 51.54 euros after Economista
reported that Spain’s Industry Ministry has considered cutting
further subsidies for renewable energy, citing unidentified
people. Analysts at Santander downgraded the shares to
underweight, the equivalent of a sell recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
