Valid Solucoes & Servicos de
Seguranca em Meios de Pagamento & Identificacao SA  headed for a
six-week low after Itau BBA cut its recommendation on the
commercial services provider to the equivalent of hold.  Rio de Janeiro-based Valid declined 1.5 percent to 41.81
reais at 12:03 p.m. in  Sao Paulo . A close at that level would be
the lowest since Dec. 21. The Bovespa index rose 1 percent.  Itau cut Valid from the equivalent of buy, saying the
company’s outperformance versus the Bovespa has left  valuations 
expensive. Valid rose 86 percent in the past year, while the
benchmark fell 6.5 percent during the same period.  “We remain optimistic about Valid’s prospects, but would
rather wait for a better entry point,” analysts including
Alexandre Spada wrote in a research report.  Valid offers products and services in identification
systems, telecommunications and payments, according to its
website. Shares trade at 20.6 times the company’s reported
earnings, compared with an average ratio of 20 for the Bovespa’s
69 members, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
