Philippine and Indonesian stocks
advanced to all-time highs, led by financial shares, after  Bank
of the Philippine Islands  reported record profits and  PT Bank
Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI)  reported earnings that beat analyst estimates.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  climbed 1.3 percent to
6,321.76 at the noon break in Manila. The  Jakarta Composite
Index (JCI)  rose 1.4 percent to 4,517.82. The two indexes were the
biggest gainers today among Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.
Bank of Philippine Islands jumped 3.9 percent and Bank Rakyat
advanced 1.9 percent.  Lenders in the Philippines, Indonesia and India are the
“most attractive,” with the “highest next-12-month banking
sector performance” outlook among Asian emerging markets this
year, according to a BernsteinResearch report dated Jan. 31. The
report also surveyed markets in China, Malaysia and Thailand.  “Indonesia and the Philippines are considered among the
most attractive markets in  Southeast Asia  because of their
improving economy and strong consumer base,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. in Manila.
“Banks give investors a good and broad exposure to those
markets and their dynamics.”  Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) , the nation’s biggest lender
by market value, advanced to 103.90 pesos. Profit rose 27
percent to a record 16.3 billion pesos ($400 million) last year,
the bank said yesterday after the close of trading.  Bank Rakyat, Indonesia’s second-largest lender by assets,
rose 1.9 percent to 8,100 rupiah, heading for the highest close
based on prices going back to November 2003. Full-year net
income jumped 23 percent to 18.5 trillion rupiah ($1.9 billion),
exceeding the 17.08 trillion-rupiah median estimate of 29
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI)  jumped 8.3 percent to the highest
since August 2011, Bank Mandiri Persero surged 5 percent to a
record and Bank Central Asia increased 3.6 percent, also heading
for an all-time high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
