Hong Kong  will combat the smuggling
of daily commodities including baby formula to China, after
parallel traders caused a shortage in the city, Lai Tung-kwok,
secretary for security, said in a press conference today.  MTR Corp. (66) , which runs trains that connects the city to the
border of mainland China, will lower the luggage limit to 23
kilograms from 32 kilograms on its trains for a trial period of
three months, Anthony Cheung, secretary for transport and
housing, said at the conference.  The government plans to amend laws to restrict the export
of milk powder, and restrict individuals leaving the city to a
maximum of two cans of formula, Cheung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
