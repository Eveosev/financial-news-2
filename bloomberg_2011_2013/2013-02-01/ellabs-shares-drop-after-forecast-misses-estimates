Tellabs Inc. (TLAB)  fell to an almost 20-
year low after forecasting first-quarter revenue that trailed
analysts’ estimates and announcing a plan to discontinue its
9200 routing product and cut expenses.  The shares slid 7.7 percent to $2.11 at the close in  New
York , the lowest price since August 1993. The  stock  tumbled
44 percent last year, while the S&P Midcap Information
Technology Sector Index advanced 15 percent.  Tellabs, which  introduced  the 9200 network-routing platform
in 2011, said yesterday after the close that it will be
discontinued this year. The cost reductions will include cutting
300 jobs, Chief Executive Officer Dan Kelly said today on a
conference call. The Naperville, Illinois-based company has
about 2,600 employees, according to its  website .  “While it wasn’t yet generating revenue, we were
previously modeling for $20 million in 2013 revenue for 9200,”
George C. Notter, a Jefferies & Co. analyst, wrote in an
investor note yesterday. Notter, who is based in  San Francisco 
and  rates  the shares hold, said Tellabs’s first-quarter forecast
was “disappointing.”  The decision on the 9200 followed a review last quarter of
Tellabs’s products and cost structure, Kelly said in a  statement 
yesterday. The company plans to “demonstrate new software-
defined networking and self-optimizing networks capabilities at
 Mobile World Congress  in February,” he said.  Tellabs forecast first-quarter revenue of $205 million to
$220 million. The average analyst estimate was $238.9 million,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
