Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) , Nigeria’s biggest
company by market capitalization, reopened its Gboko plant in
the central region of the country as demand increases for the
building material.  “We are reopening Gboko immediately,” Carl Franklin, the
London-based head of investor relations, said in an e-mailed
statement today. “Demand has been strong since the beginning of
the year.”  Dangote, Africa’s biggest producer of cement and owned by
billionaire Chairman Aliko Dangote, closed the plant last month
because cheap, imported cement was being sold in the area served
by the unit.  The company, based in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital,
forecast in August it will more than double total output to 51
million metric tons by 2015 as it expands Nigerian production.  Dangote’s  shares  gained 0.2 percent to 140.11 naira at 1:12
p.m. in Lagos. The stock has advanced 9.4 percent this year,
compared with the 14 percent rise of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
