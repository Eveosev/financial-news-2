Credit Suisse Group AG is growing
less convinced of its forecast that gold will peak on a
quarterly basis this year, saying prices are unlikely to return
to the 2011 intraday high.  Accelerating U.S. growth and contained inflation means
“the downside risks are building for gold,”  Tom Kendall , an
analyst at the bank in London, said in a report e-mailed today.
Gold climbed to an all-time high of $1,921.15 an ounce in
September 2011. It averaged a record of $1,718 in the fourth
quarter of 2012 and Credit Suisse is predicting an average of
$1,790 for the third quarter this year.  “We think it highly likely that the market has already
seen the absolute high and we caution that our forecast of a
peak in quarterly average terms in the third quarter this year
may also prove to be too bullish,” Kendall said. “The peak of
the fear trade has now also passed.”  The metal posted its longest rally in at least nine decades
last year and investors are holding a near-record amount through
gold-backed  exchange-traded products  as central banks from the
U.S. to  Europe  to  China  pledged more steps to spur economic
growth. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has said prices will probably
peak this year as the U.S. recovers. World economic growth will
accelerate to 3.5 percent this year from 3.2 percent last year,
the International Monetary Fund estimates.  Gold Prices  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.6 percent to $1,672.78
an ounce by 5:28 p.m. in London. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
gauge of 24 commodities added 5.2 percent this year and the MSCI
All-Country World Index of equities rose 5.2 percent. Treasuries
are down 1 percent, a Bank of America index shows.  Gold jumped about 90 percent since December 2008 as the
 Federal Reserve  expanded asset purchases in three rounds of so-
called quantitative easing. While Fed minutes released Jan. 3
showed some policy makers favored ending $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases this year, the central bank signaled Jan. 30 it
will maintain its stimulus program to sustain growth.  “Against any sensible benchmark gold still appears
significantly overvalued relative to the long run historical
experience,” Kendall said in the report. “With global growth
now improving and inflation expectations contained, we feel that
downside risks are building for gold.”  Average Prices  Bullion will average $1,740 an ounce this year and $1,720
in 2014, before dropping to $1,500 the following year, Credit
Suisse said in a report yesterday. That compares with an average
of $1,669 last year, the most ever. Goldman said Jan. 18 that it
expects gold to climb to $1,825 in the next three months, while
restating a forecast for prices to peak this year and be weaker
in the second half.  The metal is trading about 13 percent below the September
2011 intraday all-time high and failed to set a new record last
year for the first time since 2007. It’s also yet to exceed
previous all-time highs when adjusted for inflation, with its
1980 peak of $850 equal to $2,361 today, data compiled by the
Fed Bank of Minneapolis show.  Investors own 2,612.3 metric tons through ETPs, about 0.8
percent below the Dec. 20 record and valued at about $140.3
billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Holdings are down 19.7
tons since the beginning of January after increasing every year
since the first product was listed in  Australia  in 2003.  Coin Sales  There are still signs that physical demand is improving.
The  U.S. Mint  sold 150,000 ounces of gold coins last month, the
most since July 2010, data on its website show. Nations from
 Brazil  to  Iraq  to Russia are buying metal to add to reserves and
the London-based World Gold Council estimated in November that
2012 purchases will probably total 450 tons to 500 tons.  Prices rose 7.1 percent last year, the smallest advance
since 2008. It lagged gains in silver, platinum and palladium in
2012, metals that are used more in industry than gold. Since the
end of 2011, bullion has traded in a $273 range.  “Given its historical role as a store of value, it was not
surprising that investor demand for gold increased
substantially,” Kendall said in the report. “We feel that this
sideways drift will turn into a modest downward trend over the
course of this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
