Thailand ’s baht and government bonds
had weekly gains as overseas investors bought debt securities on
optimism the Southeast Asian nation’s economy is improving.  Global funds bought $92 million more sovereign bonds than
they sold this week through yesterday, Thai Bond Market
Association data show. The central bank said yesterday  exports 
increased 14 percent in December and the country posted a
current-account surplus of $730 million. The baht rebounded from
a one-week low of 30.01 per dollar reached on Jan. 28 amid
speculation exporters are repatriating proceeds to take
advantage of the currency’s decline.  “The trend of fund inflows into Thailand remains intact,”
said Kozo Hasegawa, a foreign-exchange trader at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “There seems to be some exporter
demand for the baht near the 30” per dollar level, he said.  The baht strengthened 0.3 percent this week to 29.81 as of
3:08 p.m. in Bangkok and reached 29.66 yesterday, matching the
Jan. 21 level that was its strongest since August 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was little changed
today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 70 basis
points, or 0.7 percentage point, to 5.5 percent from a week ago.
It rose 10 basis points today.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said yesterday people
are concerned the strong baht may hurt tourism and exports. The
Bank of Thailand should take into consideration that the
country’s relatively higher benchmark  interest rate  may also be
a cause of the baht’s recent strength, he added. The minister
had said last week the central bank should avoid fighting market
forces to stem currency gains.  Thailand’s  policy rate  is 2.75 percent, compared with a
maximum of 0.25 percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent in  Japan .  Inflation slowed in January as a stronger baht made imports
cheaper and state subsidies countered higher costs of food and
fuel. An index of consumer prices rose 3.39 percent from a year
earlier, the Ministry of Commerce said today, compared with a
previously reported 3.63 percent increase in December.  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes maturing in June 2023
declined two basis points this week and today to 3.7 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
