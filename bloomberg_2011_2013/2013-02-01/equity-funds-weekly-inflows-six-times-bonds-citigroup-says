Equity funds lured six times the
money that went into bonds in the week ended Jan. 30, according
to a Citigroup Inc. report that cited EPFR Global data.  Stock funds drew $18.8 billion, exceeding the $3 billion
that went into bonds, Markus Rosgen and Yue Hin Pong wrote in a
report today. Fifty-eight percent of the equity inflows went
into North American funds, the largest weekly inflows since
September 2011, with exchange-traded funds being the largest
beneficiaries, the analysts wrote.  Equities attracted more cash in a week where the MSCI All-
Country World Index rose 0.9 percent. The gauge closed at a
nine-month high on Jan. 29, the same day the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbed to a five-year high, as U.S.
companies including Pfizer Inc. and Valero Energy Corp. reported
earnings that beat estimates.  “This week’s outperformance of equities over bonds was
mainly driven by U.S. ETFs,” Pong wrote in an e-mail today.
“The current earnings season is quite positive.”  Of the 239 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies that have
reported quarterly  earnings  so far this reporting season, 74
percent have beaten analysts’ profit estimates, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income has grown by an average
of 10 percent, compared with a 1.1 percent increase in the
previous three months.  Emerging funds lured $3.6 billion in the week to Jan. 30,
down from the previous period’s $4 billion, the Citigroup
analysts wrote. Asian funds drew $1.6 billion, a 21st week of
inflows, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
