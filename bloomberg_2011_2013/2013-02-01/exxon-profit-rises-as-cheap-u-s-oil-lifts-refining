Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
the largest U.S. energy producers, are boosting profits with oil
refineries that some analysts and investors urged them to divest
as recently as last year.  Earnings from processing crude into fuels such as gasoline
and diesel more than made up for lagging returns from oil and
natural gas exploration during the final three months of 2012,
Exxon and Chevron reported today. Fuel refining helped propel
fourth-quarter net income to a five-year high of almost $9.95
billion for Exxon and a record $7.25 billion for Chevron.  Exxon, the world’s biggest refiner, and Chevron, operator
of fuel plants from South Korea to Mississippi, have resisted
the trend among peers such as  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  and
ConocoPhillips of spinning off refineries to focus on oil
drilling. The persistence is paying off: Exxon posted the
second-highest annual profit in U.S. history last year,
surpassed only by its own all-time high from 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Even though refining has long been seen by some as a drag
on earnings, it has now been vindicated,” said Ernie Cecilia,
who helps manage $6.7 billion as chief investment officer at
Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. “We like
integration.”  Arjun Murti at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was among analysts
who questioned Exxon’s dedication to the so-called integrated
model during a presentation by Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex
Tillerson last March in New York. Tillerson defended the
arrangement that joins refineries to chemical plants and oil
production, saying it enables the company to capture the
“highest value of each molecule.”  Incremental Value  “There’s no doubt in my mind that the integrated model
adds incremental value to everything we do,” Tillerson said
during the event.  Exxon’s full-year net income rose 9.3 percent to $44.88
billion, just $340 million shy of the U.S. profit record the
company set in 2008 when it raked in $45.22 billion.  Chevron earned $26.2 billion in 2012, the second-highest
result in company history, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The year was 2.7 percent below Chevron’s biggest-ever
profit of $26.9 billion, posted in 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Valero, Marathon  Exxon rose 7 cents to $90.04 at the close in New York.
Chevron increased 1.2 percent to $116.50.  Today’s announcements by the giants of the U.S. energy
industry capped a week in which refining companies that don’t
explore for crude or make chemicals disclosed outsized profits.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the world’s biggest so-called
independent refiner, on Jan. 29 posted a 20-fold increase in
fourth-quarter net income as expanding supplies of crude from
U.S. shale formations reduced input costs. The San Antonio-based
company’s shares surged 13 percent that day for the largest
daily advance in 15 months.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) , the Findlay, Ohio-based refiner
spunoff by Marathon Oil in June 2011, reported a $755 million
profit during the quarter after a $75 million loss a year
earlier, according to a Jan. 30 statement.  U.S. refinery margins  rose  46 percent during the October-
to-December period, in part because rising production from North
American shale pressured domestic oil prices. Crude futures
traded in New York declined by 6.2 percent during the quarter to
average $88.23 a barrel, bucking the international trend that
saw the global benchmark rise 1 percent to average more than
$110.  Four-fold Increase  Exxon’s refineries earned $1.77 billion during the period,
a four-fold increase from $425 million a year earlier. That
profit growth occurred even as the Irving, Texas-based company
lowered the amount of crude it processed by 7.9 percent to 4.837
million barrels a day compared to the same period of 2011.  The glowing refining result offset a 12 percent drop in
Exxon’s oil and gas earnings to $7.76 billion. Oil and gas
output from the company’s wells fell 5.2 percent to the
equivalent of 4.293 million barrels of crude a day from 4.53
million a year earlier, according to today’s statement.  Exxon’s crude production, which is six times more valuable
than gas on an energy-equivalent basis, fell 2.1 percent to
2.203 million barrels a day from 2.25 million during the year-
earlier period. Chemical earnings climbed to $958 million from
$543 million, according to the statement.  Chevron Results  Chevron said its refining unit returned to profit after
recording a loss a year earlier. The San Ramon, California-based
company’s fuel plants earned $925 million during the period,
compared with a $61 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Chevron processed 1.62 million barrels of crude and other
feedstock a day at its plants around the world during the
October-to-December period, a 3.3 percent increase from 1.57
million a year earlier, according to the statement. Processing
rates at the company’s U.S. refineries dropped 8 percent to
702,000 barrels a day from 763,000 a year earlier due to the
lingering impact of an August fire that shut a crude unit at a
California facility.  Chevron also benefited from a $1.4 billion gain attributed
to a gas-field swap with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  in Australia,
according to a statement from the company today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
