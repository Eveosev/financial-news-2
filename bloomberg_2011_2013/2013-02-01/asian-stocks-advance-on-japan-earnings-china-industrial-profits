Asian stocks rose this week, with the
regional benchmark index capping a three-month rally, as
Japanese equities gained on earnings and a pickup in Chinese
industrial profits highlighted the region’s growth momentum.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  advanced 11 percent
after quarterly net income doubled, putting  Japan ’s second-
largest bank by market value on pace to post record annual
profit. Anhui Conch Cement Co. paced gains among Chinese makers
of the material in Hong Kong after Shenyin & Wanguo Securities
Co. recommended the sector.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7 percent to 132.71 this
week, capping a 3 percent advance for January. Japan’s Nikkei
225 Stock Average extended its record weekly winning streak
since at least 1970. The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index 
added 0.6 percent.  “Asian markets tend to do well when global economic
prospects are improving,” said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head
of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd.,
which manages about $51 billion. “Around the world you have
prospects of improving economies and therefore improving
corporate earnings. The two largest economies are behaving in a
positive fashion, and Japan has announced a lot of policies that
are more reflationary.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  on Jan. 30 reached the highest
level since August 2011 and has rallied about 11 percent since
Nov. 14, when the announcement of Japanese elections sparked
optimism a new government would add stimulus to fight deflation.
The measure traded at 14.6 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.4
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Japan Rally  The Nikkei 225 gained 2.4 percent this week, capping a 12-
week advance after Japan’s Cabinet Office on Jan. 28 boosted its
outlook for real gross-domestic-product growth to 2.5 percent in
the year to March 31, 2014, from a previous projection of 1.7
percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 1.8 percent this
week after it capped a 10-day rally on Jan. 30, its longest
winning streak since October 2003.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.6 percent, while
 China ’s Shanghai Composite Index advanced 5.6 percent. South
Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  added 0.6 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times
Index rose 0.7 percent, and  Taiwan ’s Taiex Index climbed 2.4
percent.  Sumitomo Mitsui surged 11 percent to 3,655 yen in  Tokyo 
after the stock-market rally fueled third-quarter earnings that
beat estimates. Nine-month profit climbed 34 percent to 550.4
billion yen, approaching the record 686.8 billion yen ($7.4
billion) reached in 2006, company figures showed.  Industrial Profits  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012)  jumped 7.3 percent to 281
yen after raising its operating profit forecast.  Koito
Manufacturing Co. (7276) , which manufactures auto lights, jumped 8.5
percent to 1,502 yen after raising its full-year profit forecast.  “With economic stimulus measures and a recovery in the U.S.
economy, there are a lot of expectations about earnings for
Japan going forward,” said Jun Nishizaki, chief portfolio
manager at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees about
34 billion yen. “Profits are not that much higher this year
than the last, but we’re expecting a 20 percent increase in
profits in the next year.”  China Profits  Chinese mainland industrial companies’ profit rose 17
percent from a year earlier in December to 895 billion  yuan 
($144 billion), the  National Bureau of Statistics  said on Jan.
27 in Beijing.  Cement companies rose in Hong Kong after Shenyin & Wanguo
said demand for the material may exceed expectations this year
on infrastructure investment, rising property sales and
urbanization. Anhui Conch advanced 7.3 percent to HK$30.85.
China National Building Material Co. increased 6.1 percent to
HK$12.48, while  China Shanshui Cement Group Ltd. (691)  gained 6.9
percent to HK$5.74.  Chinese manufacturing expanded less than expected in
January. The Purchasing Managers’ Index was 50.4 in January
compared with 50.6 in December, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
yesterday in Beijing as they more than tripled the number of
companies surveyed. A separate gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics covering fewer businesses rose to a two-year
high of 52.3 from 51.5. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  Hengdeli Holdings Ltd. (3389) , the Chinese retail partner of
Swatch Group AG, slumped 12 percent to HK$2.74 in Hong Kong
after Next Magazine reported it may have lost distribution
rights for some Swiss-watch brands.  To contact the reporters on this story:
