Great Wall Motor Co. (2333) , maker of
China’s best-selling sport utility vehicle last year, fell the
most in more than two weeks in Hong Kong trading after CLSA Ltd.
cut its rating on the stock.  Great Wall declined 2.1 percent, the most since Jan. 15, to
HK$30.90. The benchmark Hang Seng Index was little changed.  CLSA reduced its rating on Great Wall to sell from buy,
with the stock-price estimate cut to HK$30.41 from HK$32.57,
according to a note today. Among 37 analysts tracked by
Bloomberg, 20 recommend buying shares of the Baoding, China-
based company, eight have the equivalent of a hold  rating , and
six suggest selling.  Great Wall’s Haval was the best-selling SUV in China last
year, with that category being the fastest-growing part of the
car market, according to the state-backed China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers. SUV sales in China, the world’s
largest automotive market, are projected to climb 23 percent
this year, the industry group said.  Net income  jumped 66 percent to 5.68 billion  yuan  ($912
million) last year, the company said Jan. 21. Great Wall, whose
sales rose 28 percent to 620,000 units in 2012, expects to
deliver 700,000 vehicles this year and introduce 13 new models,
the automaker said Jan. 26 on its  website .  Great Wall’s shares have gained 26 percent this year, after
more than doubling in 2012.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
