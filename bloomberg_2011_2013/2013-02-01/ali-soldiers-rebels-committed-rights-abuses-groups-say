Malian troops killed people suspected
of siding with Islamist rebels, while the insurgents are
responsible for the deaths of soldiers earlier this month,
according to  Human Rights Watch  and  Amnesty International .  Soldiers executed at least 13 men in the then rebel-held
towns of Konna and Sevare on the eve of a French military
campaign to regain control of northern  Mali , New York-based
Human Rights Watch said in a statement published on its website
today. At least seven Malian soldiers were killed by Islamists
in the same area, the group said.  The Malian army has committed “serious human rights
abuses,” London-based Amnesty said in a separate statement
today. Eyewitnesses in the town of Sevare said “more than two
dozen civilians” suspected of supporting the Islamists had been
executed, according to Amnesty.  Modibo Traore, a spokesman for Mali’s army, declined to
immediately comment when called today.  The groups urged the Malian authorities to investigate the
abuses and respect international humanitarian law, according to
the statements.  The central Malian town of Konna was attacked on Jan. 9 by
rebel groups including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,
prompting a French military intervention over widespread concern
the militants might try to overrun the capital, Bamako. Konna
was the last government outpost before the rebel-occupied north.  To contact the reporter on this story:
