HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , a
Brazilian oil and natural gas exploration company, rose the most
in eight weeks after  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  found oil near HRT’s
Amazon exploration areas.  HRT, based in Rio de Janeiro, gained 8.8 percent to 4.08
reais at the close in  Sao Paulo , the biggest advance since Dec.
6. It was the biggest gainer of  Brazil ’s four publicly-traded
oil companies.  Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil company is
known, found signs of oil and gas at the SOL-T-171 block in the
Solimoes Basin, the National Petroleum Agency reported on its
 website . Petrobras said last year it had the potential to
produce good quality oil at a separate discovery in the block,
which is near HRT’s properties. The basin is in the Amazon rain
forest in northern Brazil.  HRT shares have slipped 14 percent this year. The company
has mainly found gas instead of oil in the Solimoes. Gas is more
expensive to transport and sells for less than crude. Brazil’s
benchmark stock index is down 1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
