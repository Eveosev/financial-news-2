Ethanol weakened against gasoline on
concern demand isn’t strong enough to cut a glut of the biofuel.  The spread widened 1.68 cents a gallon to 58.46 cents after
a Jan. 25 Energy Information Administration report showed
stockpiles climbed to a six-week high even as production plunged
to the lowest level since the Energy Department’s statistical
arm began tracking weekly data in June 2010.  “It’s too much ethanol chasing too little demand,” said
Wallace Tyner, an agricultural economist at  Purdue University  in
 West Lafayette ,  Indiana . “Ethanol has decoupled from
gasoline.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 1.1 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.469 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the highest since Sept. 10. Prices advanced 12 percent in
January, the first monthly gain since October, and are up 13
percent this year.  Gasoline for March delivery increased 2.19 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.0536 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol.  Based on March contracts for ethanol and gasoline the
additive traded at a 57.76-cent discount to the motor fuel. The
February ethanol contract expires Feb. 5.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 87 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Jan. 25, down from 90
percent a year earlier, Energy Information Administration data
showed in a Jan. 30 report.  Corn Prices  Production of the fuel has been hurt as the price of corn,
which is used to make ethanol in the U.S., rose because drought
conditions in the Midwest reduced the corn yields. Eighteen
ethanol plants have been idled since June as the drought wilted
the corn crop, according to the  Renewable Fuels Association , a
Washington-based trade group.  Corn for March delivery fell 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$7.36 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, is minus 20 cents a
gallon down versus minus 22 cents yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Production fell 2.8 percent to 770,000 barrels a day in the
week ended Jan. 25 from the previous week, the EIA said, the
lowest level since the Energy Department’s statistical arm began
tracking weekly data in June 2010.  Plant Closures  “We’ve weeded out some of the plants that were inefficient
or in corn-starved areas,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at
INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Stockpiles rose 2.3 percent to 20.5 million barrels, the
highest since Dec. 14, the EIA report showed.  Blackford said the combination of higher demand and the
production declines will help reduce the oversupply.  Producers have had to contend with a flow of imports from
 Brazil , where ethanol is made from sugarcane. Imports averaged
9,000 barrels a day last week, up from 5,000 a year ago, Energy
Department data shows.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.21 a gallon in the week
ended today, data compiled by Bloomberg show, about 10 percent
cheaper than today’s U.S. futures price.  Ethanol producers complained yesterday about Obama
administration proposals to raise use of renewable fuels, such
as ethanol and biodiesel, as part of a 2007 energy law, also
considers sugar-cane-based ethanol to be superior to the corn-
based variety.  Brazilian Threat  “We are concerned, however, that the proposed 2013
advanced biofuel standard will open the door even wider to
imports of more expensive Brazilian sugarcane ethanol,” the
Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement yesterday.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, rose yesterday, for  advanced forms  of ethanol, which
includes the Brazilian variety, as well as for corn-based.  Advanced RINs at 30.5 cents were 19.5 cents more  expensive 
than the conventional variety, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol rose in spot market regions. The additive climbed 1
cent to $2.575 a gallon in  New York  Harbor, 3.5 cents to $2.485
in Chicago, 1.5 cents to $2.52 on the  Gulf Coast  and added 2
cents to $2.635 a gallon on the West Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
