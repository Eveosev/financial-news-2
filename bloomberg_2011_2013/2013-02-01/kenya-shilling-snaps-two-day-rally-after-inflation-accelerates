Kenya ’s shilling depreciated the most
in more than a week, snapping a two-day rally, after the
country’s inflation rate rose for the first time in 14 months.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy retreated as
much as 0.6 percent to 87.62 per dollar and traded at 87.55 by
10:02 a.m. in Nairobi. The shilling has fallen 1.7 percent this
year, compared with a 0.5 percent gain for the Ugandan shilling.  Kenyan inflation accelerated to 3.7 percent in January from
3.2 percent a month earlier, the Nairobi-based Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
That’s still below the government’s target of 5 percent. The
country will hold its presidential vote on March 4, the first
since a disputed 2007 poll sparked two months of violence in
which more than 1,100 people died.  “The Kenyan shilling is still under pressure and with
inflation edging up it will increase pressure on it as importers
seek to buy dollars in advance of the elections,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank
Ltd., said today.  The Central Bank of Kenya offered 2 billion shillings ($23
million) of seven-day repurchase agreements today, an official
who asked not to be identified in line with policy, said by
phone. The bank uses the sales to withdraw money supply from the
market and support the shilling.  Tanzania’s shilling depreciated for the fourth day,
weakening 0.5 percent to 1,626 a dollar, the lowest since
December 2011, while the Ugandan shilling weakened less than 0.1
percent to 2,662.13 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
