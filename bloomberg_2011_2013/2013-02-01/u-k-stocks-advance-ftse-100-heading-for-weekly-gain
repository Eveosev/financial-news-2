U.K. stocks  advanced, with the  FTSE
100 (UKX)  Index posting a fifth straight weekly gain, as data showed
hiring and manufacturing expanded in the U.S. in January.  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  jumped to the highest in five years after the
U.K.’s biggest Internet service provider posted earnings that
beat analyst estimates.  Diageo Plc (DGE)  advanced 1.6 percent after
analysts raised their share-price forecasts. Afren Plc soared
7.4 percent after people with knowledge of the matter said China
Petrochemical Corp. is in talks to buy more than $1 billion of
assets from the company.  The FTSE 100 advanced 70.36 points, or 1.1 percent, to
6,347.24 in  London . The gauge closed with a 1 percent increase
this week. The equity benchmark yesterday completed its eighth
straight monthly gain. The broader FTSE All-Share Index climbed
1.2 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 0.8 percent.  “While the U.S. payrolls figure came in a bit below
expectations, it was still reasonably strong,” said Simon
Reynolds, who helps manage 2.9 billion pounds as  fund manager  at
Octopus Investments Ltd. in London. “There’s a lot of positive
sentiment in the market. As long as it’s not bad news, the
sentiment’s driving markets upwards.”  A Labor Department release in  Washington  showed payrolls
rose 157,000 in January following a revised 196,000 advance in
the prior month and a 247,000 surge in November. The revisions
added a total of 127,000 jobs to the employment count in
November and December. The jobless rate increased to 7.9 percent
from 7.8 percent.  U.S. Manufacturing  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.  factory index 
rose to 53.1 in January from 50.2 a month earlier, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
projected a reading of 50.7 for last month, according to the
median of 86 forecasts. The dividing line between expansion and
contraction is 50.  U.K. manufacturing expanded for a second month in January,
a report showed. A  gauge of factory activity  slipped to 50.8,
compared with a revised 51.2 in December, Markit Economics and
the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said in London
today. The median forecast of 29 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a decline to 51 from an initially reported 51.4.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  BT Earnings  BT rallied 6.5 percent to 264.80 pence, its highest price
since Jan. 18, 2008. The company posted third-quarter adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
of 1.55 billion pounds ($2.5 billion). That compared with the
average analyst estimate for profit of 1.53 billion pounds.  Diageo, the world’s largest distiller, climbed 1.6 percent
to 1,906 pence. Exane BNP Paribas increased the share-price

Defence. The ministry will pay the firm 998 million pounds in
the next five years, Qinetiq said.  Platinum Price  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  surged 12 percent to 70.50 pence for
