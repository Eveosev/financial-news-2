China Petrochemical Corp. (386) , the
country’s largest refiner, is in talks to buy more than $1
billion of assets from  Afren Plc (AFR) , people with knowledge of the
matter said.  Sinopec Group, as China Petrochemical is known, is
interested in Afren assets including those in  Nigeria , one of
the people said, asking not to be identified as the information
is private. Afren, which also operates in the Kurdistan region
of Iraq as well as other parts of Africa, said in November that
it has been approached to sell stakes in its assets, without
elaborating on the identity of the potential buyers.  Seeking to meet demand in the world’s second-largest
economy, China’s state-backed firms bought a record $29 billion
of energy assets abroad last year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Beijing-based Sinopec Group agreed to buy a 20 percent
stake in an offshore Nigerian field from French explorer Total
SA for about $2.5 billion in November.  Afren rose 10.6 pence, or 7.4 percent, to close at 154
pence in  London  yesterday, valuing the company at 1.7 billion
pounds ($2.7 billion).  Lv Dapeng, Sinopec Group’s spokesman, did not answer calls
to his office seeking comment. An Afren official declined to
comment.  Afren, based in London, had $1.8 billion of assets in
Nigeria at end of 2011, and generated  92 percent  of its $597
million in sales there that year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Revenue probably more than doubled to about $1.5 billion
last year after production soared to 42,830 barrels of oil
equivalent a day, Afren said on Jan. 22.  Afren expects to pump as much as 47,000 barrels a day this
year, excluding Iraqi output, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
