Irish Central Bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said the institution is working to ease the burden of
the state’s bailout of lenders, which he described as “overly
expansive.”  “The bank is currently engaging with external partners to
limit and smooth the impact on Irish balance sheets of the
indebtedness accumulated as a result of the overly expansive
decision to socialize banking losses, to help accelerate
recovery of employment on a sustainable basis,” Honohan said in
a speech to be delivered in Dublin today, according to the text
of his remarks.  Irish taxpayers have committed 63 billion euros ($86
billion) to rescuing banks after the collapse of a property
bubble in 2008.  Honohan, who is also a member of the European Central
Bank’s Governing Council, is preparing to present a new plan at
one of the next ECB meetings on how the bailout of former Anglo
Irish Bank Corp. can be restructured, a person familiar with the
matter said on Jan. 29. ECB policy makers rejected his initial
proposal on how the bank’s bailout could be restructured with
central bank support, three people said the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
