Italy’s  unemployment rate  held at the
highest level in 13 years in December as companies failed to
hire amid concerns over the outlook for the country’s recession.  The  joblessness rate  was unchanged from a revised 11.2
percent in November, the Rome-based national statistics office
Istat said in a preliminary report today. The December rate
matched the  median  of seven estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Unemployment remained above 10 percent for an 11th
month.  Confidence among households and businesses fell this month
as the country’s fourth recession since 2001 damped optimism.
The euro region’s third-biggest economy shrank at least 0.6
percent in the three months through December, employers lobby
Confindustria said in a Jan. 28 report. Italy entered the
recession in the final quarter of 2011. The slump deepened as
Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s government introduced spending cuts
and tax increased to contain the deficit.  The unemployment rate for people between the age of 15 and
24 reached fell to 36.6 percent from 36.8 percent, Istat said
today.  Istat originally reported an unemployment rate of 11.1
percent in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
