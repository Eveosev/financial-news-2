India ’s benchmark bonds headed for
the biggest weekly decline since November, on speculation the
central bank will reduce open-market debt purchases after
lowering cash reserve requirements for lenders.  The  Reserve Bank  of India reduced its repurchase  rate  by 25
basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29 and cut the amount of
deposits lenders must set aside as  reserves  to 4 percent from
4.25 percent, effective Feb. 9, releasing 180 billion rupees
($3.4 billion) into the banking system. The government, which
has completed more than 90 percent of budgeted borrowings for
the year ending March 31, will today auction 120 billion rupees
of bonds maturing in 2020, 2025 and 2042.  The RBI may not conduct frequent open-market operations and
“bond yields will largely go up in the near term,” said
Harihar Krishnamoorthy, Mumbai-based treasurer at the Indian
unit of  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  “However, this will not be a big
increase as debt sales are capped for this year.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, this week to 7.92
percent in Mumbai, the biggest jump since the five days through
Nov. 23, according to the central bank’s trading system. It rose
one basis point today after falling 14 basis points last month,
the biggest drop in the 10-year rate since June.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose six basis
points this week to 7.64 percent in Mumbai, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The rate rose one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
