U.K. populations of large, common
moths plunged by two-thirds in the past 40 years, potentially
threatening plants reliant on the insects for pollination and
animals that depend on them for food, Rothamsted Research said.  Thirty-seven percent of U.K. moth species decreased by at
least half, the agricultural researcher said today in a report
on its website, citing an insect  survey  it conducted with
funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research
Council. Shrinking moth populations were more pronounced in the
country’s south than in northern areas, as habitat losses were
more widespread in southern regions while a warming climate
benefited some species further north.  “As well as being important pollinators, moths are an
absolutely vital cog in the food chain for other species, such
as birds and bats,” Chris Packham, vice president of Butterfly
Conservation, said in the statement. “The dramatic and ongoing
loss of moth abundance highlighted in this report signals a
potentially catastrophic loss of biodiversity in the British
countryside.”  The Orange Upperwing, Bordered Gothic and Brighton Wainscot
species of moth became extinct in the past 10 years, after 62
other species were wiped out in the last century, Rothamsted
said. Twenty-seven new species of moth have colonized in the
country since 2000 as climate change encouraged some moths to
migrate from continental  Europe , it said.  Butterfly Conservation worked with Rothamsted on the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
