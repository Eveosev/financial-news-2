Wheat futures fell to a one-week low
on signs of slack demand from the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter.  The government said yesterday that export sales dropped to
387,877 metric tons in the week ended Jan. 24 from 647,545 tons
a week earlier. Since June 1,  shipments  have declined 11 percent
from a year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Turmoil in Egypt, the top importer, may be damping trade.  “We’re going to have to see demand pretty soon because
it’s already February, and we only have a third of the marketing
year left,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson
Group in in Yates City, Illinois, said in a telephone interview.
“We’ve been talking about demand for a long time, but it seems
like everybody likes to sell it for $10 a ton cheaper than us,
so the competition is still out there.”  Wheat futures for March delivery dropped 1.5 percent to
$7.6775 a bushel at 1:21 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price touched $7.66, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Jan. 24.  The grain rose as much as 1.3 percent earlier as dry
weather threatened the U.S. winter crop.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
