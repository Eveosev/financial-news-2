Sharp Corp. (6753) ,  Japan ’s biggest maker of
liquid-crystal displays, rose the most in two weeks in Tokyo
trading after the Nikkei newspaper reported it will post the
first operating profit in five quarters.  Sharp  gained  as much as 5.1 percent to 327 yen and traded
at 322 yen as of 9:26 a.m., extending its advance this year to
6.3 percent. The Osaka-based manufacturer, which reports
earnings today, had an operating profit of about 2.5 billion yen
($27 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, the Nikkei
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The stock plunged 55 percent last year as Sharp posted a
record annual loss amid falling demand, competition from  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930) , and a strong yen. Sharp’s main lenders may
extend the maturity of 360 billion yen of loans due June 30 on
the condition that it makes an operating profit for the six
months ending March 31 and forecasts net income for next fiscal
year, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month.  “The report is giving the stock a short-term boost,” said
 Makoto Sengoku , a Tokyo-based market analyst at Tokai Tokyo
Securities Co. “Sharp still needs to show it has clear
financing prospects.”  Sharp isn’t the source of the Nikkei report, the company
said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. The
company, set to report third-quarter results at 3 p.m., has
forecast a full-year net loss of 450 billion yen.  The maker of Aquos TVs warned in November about its ability
to survive after hemorrhaging 103 billion yen in cash from
operations in the fiscal first half. Sharp is selling assets and
cutting jobs to revive profit after posting a 376 billion-yen
loss in the year ended March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
