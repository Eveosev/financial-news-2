Germany ’s armed forces need drones to
fill a gap in their arsenal, Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere
said as he announced that the unmanned aerial vehicles will be
developed with France.  Drones, which have been criticized in Germany for the
collateral damage their weapons can cause, are no different from
manned combat aircraft in legal, ethical and technical terms, de
Maiziere said on the German government’s YouTube  video channel 
on the Internet.  “An armed drone is superior to a manned aircraft in many
areas” and is needed to protect German soldiers on the ground,
de Maiziere said. “We have a gap in our abilities that we want
to close.”  Bild-Zeitung  reported  on Jan. 26 that de Maiziere wants a
system based on  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) ’s
Talarion design. EADS said last year that it wasn’t continuing
with its Talarion drone after failing to win government funding.  While France and the U.K. have moved forward with  BAE
Systems Plc (BA/)  and  Dassault Systemes SA (DSY)  on designing a combat
drone, progress on the Telemos surveillance system stalled after
 Francois Hollande  became French president last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
