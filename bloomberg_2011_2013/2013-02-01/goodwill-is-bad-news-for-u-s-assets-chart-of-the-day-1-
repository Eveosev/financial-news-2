Paying too much for takeovers
represents a risk to the value of U.S. companies, according to
Erin Lyons, a Citigroup Inc. credit strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks goodwill, or the amount by
which purchase prices exceeded asset values, for companies in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during the past decade. Lyons
had a similar chart in a report two days ago.  Goodwill more than doubled, to $247.34, on a per-share
basis and climbed to 7.8 percent of assets from 5.2 percent in
the 10-year period, according to quarterly S&P 500 data compiled
by Bloomberg. The total dollar amount for companies in the index
stands at $2.18 trillion. The chart displays per-share amounts
and percentages.  “In some cases, companies are realizing that paying a high
premium for acquisitions may not have been worth it,” Lyons,
based in  New York , wrote in the report.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) , the biggest U.S. iron-ore
producer, said last week that it will write down $1 billion of
goodwill from a deal completed in 2011. Caterpillar Inc., the
world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment,
disclosed a $580 million writedown earlier in January on a
Chinese unit acquired last year.  Three S&P 500 companies --  Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR) ,
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL)  --
have more goodwill than market value, based on Bloomberg’s data.
They were among 44 companies listed on U.S. exchanges that Lyons
named as potential candidates for writedowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
