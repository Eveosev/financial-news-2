Oils produced in the  Gulf of Mexico 
strengthened for the fourth day, as news that Seaway pipeline
deliveries at a key terminal would be constrained for months
caused U.S. benchmark oil to weaken against overseas imports.  West Texas Intermediate oil lost as much as $1.54 a barrel
to trade at a $19.60 below international  Brent crude , its
steepest discount since Dec. 28. The  spread  between the two
benchmarks also widened sharply yesterday, after  Enterprise
Product Partners LP (EPD)  said flows on Seaway through Jones Creek,
Texas, would be limited until late in the third quarter.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil gained 95 cents to $19.30 a
barrel above WTI, while Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened 85
cents to a $19.20 premium. Mars Blend, a sour offshore grade,
added 85 cents to $14.35 over WTI.  Limits on the 400,000-barrel-a-day Seaway pipeline
strengthen the price of offshore oils and international imports
relative to WTI, since it brings competing oils from the U.S.
midwest to the coast. Capacity at the Jones Creek terminal has
been cut to 175,000 barrels a day. The bottleneck won’t be fixed
until a lateral pipeline is finished late in the third quarter,
the company said on a conference call yesterday.  In  Canada , the price of heavy Western Canada Select for
March delivery gained strength as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  said today
it expects to begin production at the Kearl oil sands plant in
 Alberta  by the end of March with initial production of 37,000
barrels a day, ramping up to 110,000 by the end of 2013.  The delay in Kearl production means less Canadian heavy oil
supply in the  spot market . Western Canada Select gained 75 cents
to a $30.50 discount to WTI, according to Calgary oil broker Net
Energy Inc. The Kearl project had been expected to start
production in January, but was delayed because of cold weather,
a spokesman for  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , Exxon’s Canadian subsidiary,
said last month.  The price of Syncrude, a synthetic light oil produced from
oil-sands bitumen, lost 60 cents to trade at a 25-cent premium
to WTI, as a refinery that takes the grade shut some operations.  PBF Energy Inc. shut a 75,000-barrel-a-day fluid catalytic
cracker at its Toledo, Ohio, refinery yesterday to assess damage
from a fire, a person familiar with the matter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
