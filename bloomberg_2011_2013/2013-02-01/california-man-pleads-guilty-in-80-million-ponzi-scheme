A  California  man pleaded guilty to
operating a  Ponzi scheme  that took more than $80 million from
300 investors, many of whom he met at his church, federal
prosecutors said.  Anthony Vassallo, 33, of Folsom, California, and others ran
Equity Investment Management & Trading Inc., a fund that
purported to use a computer program designed by Vassallo to time
the stock market and produce an almost risk-free annual return
of 36 percent, according to a statement by U.S. Attorney
Benjamin Wagner in  Sacramento .  “Vassallo’s victims came from every walk of life and
included his friends and family,” Wagner said in the statement.
“This conviction is small consolation to Vassallo’s victims,
but a message to anyone who takes advantage of others’ trust,”
he said.  Vassallo lost virtually all the investors’ money and
ceased trading in 2009, according to the statement. He persuaded
investors not to withdraw money by falsely reporting positive
returns, prosecutors said.  A co-conspirator, Kenneth Kenitzer, 66, of Pleasanton,
California, already pleaded guilty in a related case and is
awaiting sentencing, according to the statement.  Vassallo and Kenitzer were sued by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission in 2009. A receiver appointed in that case
is working to recover assets for victims, prosecutors said.  Bruce Locke, Vassallo’s attorney, didn’t immediately return
a message seeking comment.  The case is U.S. v Vassallo, 09-90, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of California (Sacramento).  To contact the reporter on this story:
