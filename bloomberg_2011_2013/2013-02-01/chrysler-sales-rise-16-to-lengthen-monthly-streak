Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Ford (F)  Motor Co.
led the four largest automakers by U.S. sales in reporting
January gains that topped estimates, as buyers return to
showrooms to begin a fourth consecutive year of growth.  Toyota’s deliveries of cars and light trucks surged 27
percent and Ford’s climbed 22 percent, while  General Motors Co. (GM) 
and Chrysler Group LLC sales each rose 16 percent, the companies
said yesterday. Industrywide light-vehicle sales increased 14
percent, according to researcher Autodata Corp., matching
analysts’ estimates.  Consumers are replacing cars and trucks that have aged to
about 11 years on average after deferring purchases of new autos
following the recession that ended in 2009. The demand is
spurring carmakers to boost hiring and output, contributing a
jolt to U.S. economic growth. LMC Automotive forecasts North
American auto production will climb to  15.9 million  vehicles
this year, up 87 percent from four years earlier.  “It’s pretty clear now that we’re in pronounced recovery,
so there is no question that there is a need to have the
capacity to fuel that further growth,”  Jeff Schuster , a Troy,
Michigan-based analyst for LMC Automotive, said in a telephone
interview. “The  auto industry  is at the highest level in terms
of importance to the  U.S. economy  in a long time.”  The average estimates of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for increases of 17 percent by Ford, 15 percent by Chrysler
and 13 percent by GM. Toyota exceeded eight analysts’ average
estimate for a 22 percent gain.  Shares Rise  GM climbed 0.3 percent to $28.17 at the close yesterday in
New York, and Ford rose 0.5 percent to $13.02. Toyota’s American
depositary receipts increased 2.9 percent to $98.13 and Honda’s
ADRs gained 2.5 percent to $38.62.  “The biggest driver of this year’s story is going to be
replacement,”  Ken Czubay , Ford’s vice president of U.S.
marketing, sales and service, said yesterday on a conference
call. “The age of the fleet has continued to get a little bit
older” and new vehicles are “getting significantly better fuel
economy.”  Ford’s subcompact, compact and midsize cars all increased
sales in the same month for the first time since June 2011. The
Dearborn, Michigan-based company’s deliveries of F-Series
pickups surged 22 percent to 46,841.  Sales for Chrysler, majority owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , climbed to
117,731 cars and light trucks from 101,149 a year earlier, led
by demand for its Dodge models, the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
company said in a statement. The Dodge Dart compact had its best
month since its introduction in June.  Boosting Output  Chrysler plans to boost production to 2.6 million vehicles
in 2013, from 2.4 million last year and 2 million in 2011, said
Scott Garberding, senior vice president of manufacturing. The
company’s sales gain in January extended Chrysler’s stretch of
year-over-year increases to 34 months.  “We’re adding some capacity, but we’re more heavily
utilizing everywhere the capacity that we have,” Garberding
said yesterday in an interview with  Tom Keene  and Sara Eisen on
Bloomberg Television. “Many of our factories in the U.S. today
are in fact going at full speed. Our Jeep plants are saturated”
aside from a Toledo factory that is revamping for a new product.  Additional U.S. production has extended beyond domestic
automakers. Toyota added about 350 jobs at its factory in
Princeton,  Indiana , during the second half of 2012 to build the
Highlander sport-utility vehicle. Deliveries of that model
surged 29 percent in January to 8,831. Another 50 will be hired
this year, said Kelly Dillon, a Toyota spokeswoman at Princeton.  Growth Contribution  The auto industry contributed 14 percent of the 2.1 percent
average rate of growth for gross domestic product in the
recovery that began in the third quarter of 2009 to the fourth
quarter of 2012, according to data from the Commerce Department.  GM’s deliveries of Chevrolet Silverado pickups climbed 32
percent to 35,445 while sales for the GMC Sierra truck increased
35 percent to 12,846. The Detroit-based automaker said inventory
of full-size pickups still rose 5.7 percent from Dec. 31 to
234,342, or 117 days supply.  GM is “very comfortable” with its inventory levels as
part of plans to prepare truck factories to build revamped
Silverados and Sierras for the 2014 model year, said Kurt McNeil, the company’s vice president of U.S. sales operations.  “That piece of the business is picking up and being
relatively robust,” McNeil said during a conference call.
“We’re in a good place.”  2013 Outlook  Automakers in 2012 sold the most cars and light trucks in
the U.S. in five years. GM, Ford and Toyota will lead a U.S.
auto market that probably will climb to 15.1 million vehicle
sales this year, the average of 18 estimates, from 14.5 million
in 2012.  GM shares gained 43 percent for the past six months through
yesterday, far outpacing the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s 10
percent increase. Over the same period, Ford rose 44 percent and
Toyota shares added 50 percent.  U.S. light-vehicle sales began the year with a 14 percent
increase in January to 1.04 million, Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey-
based Autodata said yesterday in an e-mail. That matched the
average of nine analysts’ estimates. The annualized industry
sales  rate  for January, which is adjusted for seasonal trends,
was 15.3 million, topping the 15.2 million average estimate of
17 analysts.  Honda (7267)  Motor Co. and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  sales rose less than
analysts’ average estimates. Honda deliveries rose 13 percent to
93,626 vehicles in January, trailing eight analysts’ average
estimate for an increase of 21 percent.  Sales of the Accord surged 75 percent to 23,924, offsetting
the CR-V SUV’s 6.1 percent drop to 17,809, the Tokyo-based
carmaker said in a statement.  Altima Slips  Nissan sales rose 2 percent last month to 80,919, the
company said in a statement, missing the 3.5 percent increase
that was the average of seven estimates. Deliveries of the
Altima fell 4 percent to 21,464, while Pathfinder sport-utility
vehicle sales more than tripled to 6,281.  AutoNation Inc. (AN) , the largest retailer of new vehicles in
the U.S., yesterday reported January retail sales rose 22
percent. The  Fort Lauderdale , Florida-based company is taking
trade-ins from customers who have racked up more than 150,000
miles on their cars or trucks, Chief Executive Officer  Mike Jackson  said in a Jan. 31 interview on Bloomberg Television.  ‘Personal Austerity’  “The mindset of the consumer is ‘I put my life on hold in
’08, ’09, ’10, I had my personal austerity program,” Jackson
said. The consumer is saying “‘my car is worn out.’ They have
to do something.”  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  combined to sell 2.3
percent more vehicles in January than a year earlier, missing
six analysts’ average estimate of 7.4 percent. Deliveries of the
Sonata, Seoul-based Hyundai’s top-selling model, slipped 8.6
percent to 13,247, according to a statement. Kia’s Optima sales
surged 28 percent to 11,252.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  boosted deliveries of VW and Audi brand
vehicles in January by 6.9 percent, falling short of the 20
percent average estimate of four analysts. The Wolfsburg,
Germany-based company’s sales of its top seller, the Jetta
sedan, slipped 4 percent to 10,522, while  Passat (PSAT)  deliveries rose
40 percent to 8,856.  To contact the reporters on this story:
