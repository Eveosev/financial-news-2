Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the second-largest
Canadian crude producer, raised the estimate for initial costs
at its delayed Kearl project to C$12.9 billion ($12.9 billion)
and predicted output would begin by the end of March.  The increased costs are due to issues transporting heavy
equipment to the site in  Alberta  and “harsh weather” as
startup began, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
today. The figure is an 18 percent increase from a December 2011
company estimate for the 3.2-billion-barrel project, which
Imperial had said would begin operating last year.  “They’ve revamped the design and the cost target was left
out there for a long time without updating it,” said Sam La Bell, an analyst at Veritas Investment Research in Toronto who
has a buy rating on Imperial and doesn’t own the shares. “They
haven’t been very forthcoming” about the costs and how they’ve
changed, he said.  Kearl’s output will reach 110,000 barrels a day in the
“next several months” as the company mines the mixture of
heavy oil, sand and water to get crude. An expansion will bring
daily production to 345,000 barrels in 2015, Imperial said
today. Kearl is one of the largest oil-sands deposits in  Canada ,
which holds an estimated 173 billion barrels of recoverable
crude in three areas.  Weather added to Kearl’s delays after the company was
forced to re-route hundreds of South Korean-built modules
through Montana and  Idaho  because of protests by local
residents. The project development costs have risen to C$6.80 a
barrel, up 10 percent from the prior estimate of C$6.20 a
barrel, Imperial said.  Doubling Production  Kearl is part of Imperial’s effort to more than double oil
production to 600,000 barrels a day by 2020.  Imperial, which is  70 percent owned  by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,
today reported fourth-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’
estimates as record refining earnings made up for a decline in
output. Net income rose 7 percent to C$1.08 billion, or C$1.26 a
share, from C$1.01 billion, or C$1.18, a year earlier, the
company said in a statement today.  Gross output in the fourth quarter averaged the equivalent
of 285,000 barrels a day of oil, down 2 percent from 291,000 a
year earlier because of the sale of natural gas assets.  Refining profit in the quarter rose to C$549 million from
C$272 million a year earlier as the company reaped the
difference between low-cost Western Canadian crude and the price
of gasoline. Imperial is the largest refiner in Canada, with
four facilities capable of processing 508,000 barrels a day.  Imperial rose 0.3 percent to C$43.91 at the close in
Toronto. The stock has five buy, 11 hold and one sell  rating 
from analysts.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  is Canada’s largest oil producer by
market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
