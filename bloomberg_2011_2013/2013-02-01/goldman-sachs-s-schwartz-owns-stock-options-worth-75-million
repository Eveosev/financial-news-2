Harvey M. Schwartz, who became
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s chief financial officer yesterday,
owns stock and options in the bank worth about $75 million.  Schwartz owns 175,493 shares of Goldman Sachs, along with
171,419 restricted stock units that have been awarded over the
past three years, according to his initial ownership filing as
CFO today. He also has 302,888 options that expire in 2018, the
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows.  At today’s closing price of $149.90, the shares and
restricted stock units, which are fully vested, are worth $52
million. The options, which have strike price of $78.78, are
worth about $22.8 million, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Schwartz, 48, was one of three global co-heads of the sales
and trading division before the New York-based firm announced in
September that he would succeed David A. Viniar as CFO at the
end of January. Viniar, whose 12 years in the role made him the
longest-serving CFO on  Wall Street , is joining the bank’s board
of directors.  Schwartz also owns 30,000 shares, with a value $4.5
million, in a trust that benefits a family member, according to
the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
