South Korea  raised its overseas crude
purchases in January by 0.9 percent, the first year-on-year
increase since November.  Imports climbed to 80.1 million barrels last month, or
about 2.6 million barrels a day, from 79.5 million barrels a
year earlier, the  Ministry  of  Knowledge Economy  said in an e-
mailed statement. That was the biggest volume since November,
when it brought in 80.2 million barrels, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg .  The cost of crude dropped 2.3 percent to $111.90 a barrel
from a year earlier, the ministry said, citing preliminary
figures. The country in January paid 1.4 percent less for its
imports at $8.97 billion.  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy exported almost half of the
crude that it imported in 2012 after refining it into gasoline,
diesel and other fuels, according to data from  Korea  National
Oil Corp. Oil products accounted for 10.3 percent of Korea’s
2012 exports, becoming the biggest contributor, followed by
semiconductors, the ministry said Jan. 1.  Overseas shipments of oil products climbed 12 percent in
January from the previous year to $4.93 billion, according to
today’s report. Petrochemical exports were valued at $4.21
billion, up 18 percent from a year ago.  Imports of liquefied natural gas cost $3.59 billion in
January, up 38 percent from the same month a year earlier. The
amount paid for coal shipments fell 35 percent to $1.07 billion,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
