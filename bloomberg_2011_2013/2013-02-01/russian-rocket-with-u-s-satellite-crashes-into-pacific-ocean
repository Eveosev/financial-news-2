 A Russian-Ukrainian Zenit-3SL rocket
carrying a U.S. satellite crashed about 40 seconds after lifting
off from a platform in the  Pacific Ocean .  Sea Launch AG, a joint venture of Moscow-based Rocket &
Space Corp. Energia and  Boeing Co. (BA) , are attempting to determine
the cause of the crash, the company said in a  statement  on its
website today.  “We are very disappointed with the outcome of the launch
and offer our sincere regrets to our customer, Intelsat, and
their spacecraft provider, Boeing,” Kjell Karlsen, president of
Sea Launch, said in the statement.  The loss of the Intelsat 27 satellite follows at least four
failed Russian spacecraft launches since 2010. Roscosmos, the
country’s state space agency, halted launches of Proton-M
rockets in August after the latest accident lost two
telecommunications satellites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
