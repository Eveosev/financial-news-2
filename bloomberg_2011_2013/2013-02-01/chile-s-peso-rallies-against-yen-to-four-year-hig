Chile ’s peso rose to a four-year high
against the yen and has reached a level against its biggest
trading partners that in 2008 spurred the central bank to
intervene to stem the gains.  The peso rose 1 percent to 5.0891 per yen as of 1:18 p.m.
in Santiago, the highest since September 2008. The peso was
little changed against the dollar at 471.34. The currency as
measured against a basket of the euro, yen, pound, dollar and
Canadian dollar reached its strongest level since April 2008 in
the first two weeks of January, according to central bank data.  The peso has appreciated to levels matching those that
provoked the central bank to intervene in April 2008 and January
2011.  “Although we’re flat against the dollar, appreciation
against other currencies has continued,” said Ruben Catalan, an
economist at Banco de Credito & Inversiones in Santiago.  Japan  bought $8.4 billion of Chile’s exports last year, the
most after after  China  and the U.S., according to central bank
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
