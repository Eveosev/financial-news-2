Taiwan ’s dollar headed for the worst
week in 16 months as the yen’s slide to a 2 1/2-year low fanned
speculation the central bank will rein in the exchange rate to
protect exports.  Policy makers warned on Jan. 29 they will intervene in the
currency market if “irregular factors,” such as large fund
flows, cause excessive volatility. Taiwan and  Japan  compete in
the global market for electronic products. Premier Sean Chen has
resigned for family and health reasons, presidential spokesman
Fan-Chiang Tai-chi said today. Central bank governor Perng Fai-
nan will remain in his position, the Economic Daily News
reported, citing a government official it didn’t identify.  “The central bank’s been carefully watching other Asian
currencies,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based fund manager at
Uni-President Assets Management Corp., which oversees $700
million. “Looks like Perng will stay on as governor. Things
shouldn’t change too much from a currency-trade perspective.”  The Taiwan dollar weakened 1 percent this week to NT$29.546
against its U.S. counterpart as of 9:26 a.m. local time,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It gained 0.1 percent today and
reached NT$29.70 on Jan. 29, the weakest since Sept. 14. The yen
hit the lowest level since June 2010 today.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
of expected swings used to price options, climbed 122 basis
points, or 1.22 percentage point, to 4.6 percent during the
five-day period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts rose 11 basis points today.  A government report yesterday showed Taiwan’s economy
expanded 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier,
exceeding the 3 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
For the whole year, gross domestic product increased 1.25
percent, after a 4.1 percent growth in 2011.  Government bonds fell from a week ago. The yield on the
1.125 percent notes due September 2022 rose two basis points to
1.19 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate
was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
