Norbord Inc. (NBD) , a producer of wood
sheathing used to build homes, rose the most since March 2012
after rival Ainsworth Lumber Co. agreed to an acquisition by
 Louisiana-Pacific Corp. (LPX)   Norbord rose 10 percent to C$29.98 at the close in Toronto,
where the company is based.  Louisiana-Pacific agreed to buy Vancouver-based Ainsworth
for about C$906 million ($863 million) in cash and stock to add
Canadian production of oriented strand board, a plywood
substitute, the companies announced yesterday.  Louisiana-Pacific’s “big bet” on oriented strand board
should reassure shareholders in Norbord, which also makes the
building material, about the market’s fundamentals, Pierre Lacroix, a Montreal-based analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc.
said in a note.  Other wood-products companies also gained.  Western Forest
Products Inc. (WEF) , a Duncan, British Columbia-based forest-products
company, and International Forest Products Inc. both rose 4.3
percent.  Louisiana-Pacific, based in Nashville,  Tennessee  said its
paying about 5.7 times Ainsworth’s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization. The median Ebitda multiple
paid in three comparable deals during the past 10 years was 3.6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
