Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s third-biggest carmaker, will begin selling its remodeled  Fit  hatchback
tomorrow in Japan to challenge  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s lead in
hybrid compact cars.  The third-generation Fit will be priced from 1.26 million
yen ($13,000) for the gasoline version, Tokyo-based Honda said
in a statement today. The sales target for the model is 15,000
vehicles a month.  Honda President Takanobu Ito is introducing the revamped
Fit, sold as the Jazz in some markets including  China , to help
increase annual sales to 6 million vehicles by March 2017 and
dent the dominance of Toyota’s Prius c. Ito is counting on
growth in  emerging markets  and demand for compacts such as the
Fit, the smallest in Honda’s portfolio and its top seller in
 Japan , as motorists increasingly buy small cars.  The gasoline-electric version of the model can run 36.4
kilometers per liter under Japanese standards, Honda said.
That’s better mileage than the Prius c, Toyota’s most fuel-efficient hybrid, which covers 35.4 kilometers per liter under
the same standards, according to company figures.  Honda said it will price the hybrid version at 1.63 million
yen in Japan. The price is 3 percent less than for the Prius c,
the world’s best-selling gasoline-and-electric vehicle, which is
called the Aqua in Japan.  Fit Pre-Orders  Honda rose 2.9 percent to 3,780 yen as of 2:04 p.m. in
Tokyo trading, compared with a 0.6 percent advance in Japan’s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The shares have gained 20
percent this year.  The company expects hybrids to account for 70 percent of
domestic Fit sales, Senior Managing Officer Sho Minekawa said
today in Chiba, near  Tokyo . It has advance orders of 25,000 for
the new Fit in Japan, he said.  Honda will make the car at its factory in Yorii, northwest
of Tokyo, that opened in July. It will also build the car at a
new factory in  Mexico  opening next year that will eventually
have an annual capacity of 200,000 vehicles.  Aqua is the top-selling car in Japan, followed by the
conventional Prius, according to figures from the Japan
Automobile Dealers Association. Sales of the Aqua reached
160,993 units in the first seven months of this year, the
association’s data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
