Bob Dylan ’s doodles,  Bryan Ferry  and “The Sound of Music” are our choices for  London  this week.  STAGE  You have one week left to see the highest-grossing production in the history of the  Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre : “The Sound of Music.”  Wealthy Austrian widower Captain von Trapp (Michael Xavier) hires trainee nun Maria ( Charlotte  Wakefield) to look after his extensive progeny at his nice mansion. Then the Nazis arrive.  A chance to hear “Edelweiss” in leafy surroundings. Ends Sept. 14:  http://www.openairtheatre.com  or +44-844-826-4242.  DINING  Coal Vaults is a new restaurant and bar on Wardour Street in Soho. Every dish on the seasonal European menu has a matching cocktail. The industrial-style venue is the brainchild of two young entrepreneurs, Martyn Simpson and Felix Leuschner. There are five separate vaults for private dining. Information:  http://www.coalvaults.com/ .  Meatopia comes to London for the first time on Sept. 7. More than 20 chefs will create dishes and cook them over fire. The lineup includes  Fergus Henderson  of St. John, Richard H Turner of Hawksmoor and Gizzi Erskine, the Sunday Times cook. Information:  http://www.meatopia.co.uk/ .  VISUAL ARTS  Dylan has produced a dozen pastel sketches in the last year or two that are on show at the  National Portrait Gallery .  The rough, angular drawings look like the sketches done in courtrooms. The titles are plays on the word ’face’ (“Face the Music,” “About Face”), followed by a name. Information:  http://www.npg.org.uk  or +44-20-7306-0055.  MUSIC  The  Last Night of the Proms  has a female conductor for the first time: Marin Alsop leads the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Nicely timed to refute Vasily Petrenko’s stone age comments about orchestras playing better for male sticks. The Saturday night soloists include Joyce DiDonato, wearing gems loaned by Chopard, and Nigel Kennedy.  Kennedy is also playing the Proms in the Park event across from the  Royal Albert Hall . Ferry is another star attraction at the outdoor concert. Information:  http://www.bbc.co.uk   The iTunes festival at the Roundhouse this weekend features Queens of the Stone Age, Phoenix and Bastille. Information:  http://www.itunesfestival.com/   OTHER LONDON OUTINGS  The Mayor of London is throwing his annual nine-day  celebration of the Thames river  as of this weekend. You can get a guided tour of the Queen’s row-barge the Gloriana (in the classic boat festival), hear poet Andrew Motion give a cruise-ship talk, and watch a 21-mile (34-kilometer) boat race with dozens of crews.
