The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase shipments of crude by 1.7
percent this month, tanker tracker Oil Movements said.  OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil,
will boost exports by 340,000 barrels a day to about 23.84
million barrels a day in the four weeks to Sept. 21 from the
period to Aug. 24, the researcher said in a report. The figures
exclude two of OPEC’s 12 members, Angola and  Ecuador .  Brent crude  traded today at about $114.70 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. It gained 5.9 percent
last month amid unrest in  Egypt , Libya and Syria.  Middle Eastern shipments will rise by 2 percent to 17.48
million barrels a day to Sept. 21, compared with 17.14 in the
month to Aug. 24, according to Oil Movements. Those figures
include non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on on board tankers will decline 0.4 percent to
481.27 million barrels on Sept. 21, data from Oil Movements
show. The researcher calculates volumes by tallying tanker
bookings, and excludes crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
