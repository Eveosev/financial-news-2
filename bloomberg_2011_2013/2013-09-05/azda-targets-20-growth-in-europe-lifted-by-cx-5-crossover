Mazda Motor Corp. (7267)  forecasts sales in
 Europe  will rise more than 20 percent to 150,000 vehicles this
year boosted by its CX-5 compact crossover as competitors in the
region brace for a sixth straight year of declining demand.  Mazda, based in Hiroshima,  Japan , is targeting deliveries
of at least 180,000 vehicles in Europe by 2016 as part of its
goal to increase sales to 1.7 million vehicles from 1.2 million
last year, Jeff Guyton, Mazda’s European chief, said today in a
telephone interview.  “If you talk to most automakers in Europe, they see doom
and gloom,” said Guyton. “For us, the story’s exactly the
opposite.”  Mazda is seeking to double net income this fiscal year
after posting its first annual  profit  in five years for the 12
months through March 2013. The stock has more than doubled this
year as the carmaker benefits from a weaker yen and demand for
the CX-5 and Mazda 6 sedan.  The brand will introduce a new version of the Mazda 3
compact at the International Auto Show in  Frankfurt  next week.
The Mazda 3, the CX-5 and the Mazda 6 have potential to sell
about 50,000 vehicles a year, said Guyton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
