Gasoline maintained a decline as the
Energy Information Administration reported supplies along the
U.S. East Coast were little changed last week.  Futures sank as much as 1.7 percent. Inventories in PADD 1,
where New York-traded futures contracts are delivered, slipped
36,000 barrels to 58.3 million as of Aug. 30. Stocks nationwide
fell 1.83 million barrels to 216 million. Demand rose 0.7
percent while  consumption  over four weeks was 0.2 percent below
a year earlier.  “There were no great changes in the demand,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“Inventories are still 17 million barrels higher than this time
last year.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 3.1 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.8333 a gallon at 12:28 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , on trading volume that was 13 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day.  The October contract’s premium to November narrowed 0.95
cent to 1.26 cents, indicating supplies are ample to meet
demand. The front-month contract has not been in contango, or
valued less than later-month contracts, since April 30.  The motor fuel’s crack  spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed $2.35 to $10.72 a barrel. The fuel’s
 premium  over Brent fell $1.65 to $3.74. The spread touched
$3.66, the smallest intraday level since January.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.2 cent to $3.587 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Retail gasoline is 23.7 cents below a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery rose 1.24
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $3.1495 a gallon on trading volume
that was 20 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 52 cents to $24.01
a barrel while the premium over Brent increased 14 cents to
$16.99 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
