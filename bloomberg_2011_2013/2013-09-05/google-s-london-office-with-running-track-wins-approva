Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s largest search engine, won final approval for its new U.K. headquarters next to King’s Cross train station in London.  The Camden borough council gave the 85,800-square-meter (920,000 square-foot) building approval at a meeting today. The project on a 2.4-acre (1-hectare) site will have a swimming pool and a running track on the roof and space for as many as 5,000 workers, according to a  filing  to the borough.  Google expects to move into the building of seven to 11 stories in 2015 after it agreed in January to buy the land from King’s Cross Central LP, according to a statement at the time. Construction is due to start at the end of this year, the  Mountain View , California-based company said in the statement.  About 16 stores will also be built on the ground floor of the new building. Kings Cross Central will retain ownership of those shops as part of the deal with Google, according to the filing to the borough.  The application for the site was made by Argent (King’s Cross) Ltd. London-based Argent is one of the owners of closely held King’s Cross Central LP, together with London & Continental Railways Ltd. and parcel-delivery company DHL. They are reviving the area as part of a plan to develop 67 acres of land by building 1,900 homes and enough office and retail space for 35,000 jobs.
