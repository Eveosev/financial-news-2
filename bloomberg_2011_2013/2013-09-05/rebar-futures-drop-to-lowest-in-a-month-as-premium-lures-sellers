Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell for the third day to the lowest level in almost a
month as the premium to spot market prices attracted selling.  Rebar for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost as much as 0.4 percent to 3,723  yuan  ($608) a metric ton,
the lowest since Aug. 9, before trading at 3,730 yuan at 10:31
a.m. local time.  The average  spot price  of rebar rose 0.1 percent to 3,604
yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Steel mills may increase sales into the futures
market as these prices offer a premium to spot levels, said Xia
Caijun, an analyst at GF Futures Co. in Guangzhou.  “The discount in the spot market will lead to some
correction in the futures,” Xia said.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port fell 0.5
percent yesterday to $138 a dry ton, according to a price index
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
