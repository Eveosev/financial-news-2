Mercuria Energy Trading SA bid
unsuccessfully for  North Sea  Brent crude for a second day. BP
Plc failed to sell Azeri Light.  Shipments of North Sea Oseberg for October are planned at
six cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, unchanged from this month,
a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Mercuria bid for Brent crude loading Sept. 28 to Sept. 30
at $1.20 a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That’s 15 cents more than its offer yesterday.  The trading group didn’t manage to buy Forties at a 65-cent
premium to Dated Brent for Sept. 23 to Sept. 25 loading.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc offered Forties for Sept. 17 to Sept.
19 at either a 35-cent premium to Dated Brent or $1.75 more than
the cash cost of North Sea crudes for November. The company also
offered Forties for Sept. 19 to Sept. 21 at a 45-cent premium to
Dated Brent or $1.85 more than the cash cost of North Sea crudes
for November. Both offers weren’t met, the survey showed.  Brent for October settlement traded at $115.33 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
unchanged from the previous session. The November contract was
at $113.73, a discount of $1.60 to October.  Oseberg exports will total 3.6 million barrels, or about
116,000 barrels a day, according to the plan. Loading programs
for Brent, Forties and Ekofisk, the other three crudes that make
up the Dated Brent benchmark, will be issued tomorrow.  Statfjord crude loadings are scheduled at five cargoes in
October, Gullfaks at six lots and Troll at 13 shipments.
Loadings of Norwegian crudes Norne, Njord, Skarv and Aasgard
will rebound next month as maintenance at these fields ends.  Urals/Mediterranean  BP failed to sell 650,000 barrels of Azeri Light crude for
loading Sept. 20 to Sept. 24 at a premium of $5.95 to Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy .  There were no bids or offers for Urals crude in the window,
the survey showed.  PKN Orlen,  Poland ’s largest oil company, is seeking to buy
100,000 metric tons of Urals for loading Sept. 22 to Sept. 26
from the  Baltic Sea , say two people who have received the
tender, asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The tender closes today.  The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, operator of the only oil-export link in  Russia  that has shared foreign ownership, will
cut daily September crude exports from the  Black Sea  to the
lowest in six months, a final loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  CPC will ship 2.57 million metric tons this month, compared
with 2.87 million tons in August, according to the schedule.
That’s equal to 664,724 barrels a day, the least since March and
down 7.6 percent from last month.  Iraq resumed pumping of Kirkuk crude to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan today at 2 a.m. local time, according to port agent
Boutros Maritime & Transport SA.  West Africa  Three out of four August shipments of Angolan Saturno crude
and all four lots in September have been delayed by 13 to 18
days, a revised program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  August exports have been reduced to two cargoes from four,
September shipments are stable at four lots, while two September
cargoes will now load in October. All cargoes are 950,000
barrels each. BP lifted the force majeure on Saturno exports on
Sept. 3.  PT Pertamina is seeking to buy 600,000 to 950,000 barrels
of crude oil for November delivery to Cilacap or Balikpapan in
 Indonesia  in a tender, according to a tender document obtained
by Bloomberg News. The tender closes Sept. 9 at 5pm Singapore
time, with offers valid until 6pm the following day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
