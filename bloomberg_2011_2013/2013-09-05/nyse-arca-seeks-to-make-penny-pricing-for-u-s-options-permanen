NYSE Euronext (NYX)  asked regulators to
end a six-year test of quoting U.S. options in 1-cent increments
by making the system permanent while limiting the program to the
150 most-active securities.  The trial, which began in January 2007 amid attempts by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to cut investors’
trading costs, now includes 363 options classes. NYSE Arca, the
fifth-biggest U.S. options exchange by volume last month, said
this should be reduced by more than half, according to an SEC
 filing  dated yesterday.  “Benefits have been concentrated in the 150 most-active”
options families, the NYSE Euronext division said. Including
less-traded contracts “resulted in more technology overhead
costs to provide for capacity and speed for quote activity.”  Before the test of 1-cent increments, U.S. options were
commonly traded in 5- and 10-cent increments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
