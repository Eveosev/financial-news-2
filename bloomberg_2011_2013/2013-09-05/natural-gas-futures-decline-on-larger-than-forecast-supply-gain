Natural gas futures fell from a
five-week high in New York after a government report showed that
U.S. stockpiles increased by more than forecast last week.  Gas dropped as much as 2.7 percent after the Energy
Information Administration said inventories expanded by 58
billion cubic feet in the week ended Aug. 30 to 3.188 trillion
cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed a
gain of 54 billion. A survey of Bloomberg users also predicted
an increase of 54 billion.  “It’s definitely a bearish number,” said Aaron Calder, an
analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston. ‘It definitely showed
that some power generators are switching back to cheaper coal
for power generation.’’  Natural gas for October delivery slid 9.3 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $3.59 per million British thermal units at 1 p.m. on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas traded at $3.69 before the
storage number was released at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington . Volume
was 37 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.
The futures earlier advanced to $3.719 per million Btu, the
highest since July 25.  The discount of October to November futures widened 0.3
cent to 8.7 cents. October gas traded 32.8 cents below the
January contract, compared with 31.1 cents yesterday.  Options Trading  October $3.50 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 1.8 cents higher at 5.9 cents per
million Btu on volume of 1,453 at 12:56 p.m. Puts accounted for
61 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for October at-the-money options was 29.68 percent at 1 p.m., compared with
31.6 percent yesterday.  The stockpile increase was smaller than the five-year
average gain for the week of 60 billion cubic feet, department
data show. The  surplus  to the five-year average dipped to 1.4
percent from 1.5 percent the previous week. Supplies were 6.2
percent below year-earlier inventories, compared with 7 percent
in the prior period.  The storage injection reported today “was more than
expected and implies some weakening of the background supply-demand balance, which may carry through for the weeks ahead,”
Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York, said in a note to clients today.  Temperature Forecast  Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland ,
predicted normal or lower-than-average temperatures in the
eastern U.S. through Sept. 9.  The high in New York on Sept. 7 may be 78 degrees
Fahrenheit (26 Celsius), matching the usual reading, according
to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,  Pennsylvania . Temperatures
in Washington may reach 81, 2 below normal.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Natural gas  production  from the lower-48 states increased
0.1 percent in June to 73.62 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 73.51 billion in May, the EIA said Aug. 30.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first five months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, according to EIA data.  Tropical Storm Gabrielle weakened to a depression today as
it moved toward the Dominican Republic, the National Hurricane
Center in Miami said in an 11 a.m.  outlook .  An area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms that
extends from the northeast Leeward Islands has a 20 percent
chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next five days,
the hurricane center said. Another system in the southwestern
Gulf of Mexico has a 30 percent chance of development during the
same period.  The Gulf will account for 5.7 percent of U.S. gas
production this year, EIA data show. Sept. 10 is the statistical
peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, according to the
hurricane center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
