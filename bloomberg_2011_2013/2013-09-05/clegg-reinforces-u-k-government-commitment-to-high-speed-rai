U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  reaffirmed the coalition government’s commitment to
building a high-speed rail line between London and the north of
England.  Clegg said the proposed line, which is known as HS2 and has
been criticised by former ministers and some members of Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s  Conservative Party , is a key part of
the government’s strategy for balanced economic growth.  “HS2 is central to our 21st-century ambition to build a
stronger economy in the U.K.,” Clegg said in a speech today in
Glasgow,  Scotland , according to extracts released by his office.
“We know that our competitors have been investing in better
roads and railways for decades, but the last time we built a new
main rail line north of  London  was more than 100 years ago.”  The new line would help to tackle the north-south economic
divide in the U.K. by increasing capacity and cutting journey
times, Clegg said. The deputy prime minister rounded on critics
of the plan, saying it can be delivered in time and on budget.
The business case has been tested “rigorously,” he said.  “The alternatives they suggest, such as upgrading existing
lines, aren’t viable answers,” Clegg said. “For example, the
extra capacity created through the 9 billion-pound upgrade of
the West Coast main line has already been filled.” Nine billion
pounds is $14 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
