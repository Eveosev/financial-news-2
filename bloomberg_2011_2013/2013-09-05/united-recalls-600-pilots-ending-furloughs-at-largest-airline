United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
the world’s largest carrier, said it’s recalling all of its
almost 600 pilots who have been on furlough to fill future
staffing needs.  Training classes for those pilots begin next month and will
run through the end of the year, Chicago-based United said today
in a statement.  The recalled pilots will join their 12,000 peers at United,
which merged with Continental Airlines Inc. in 2010, surpassing
Delta Air Lines Inc. as the world’s biggest carrier.  United didn’t specify which types of airplanes the recalled
pilots will fly, nor the average length of the furloughs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
