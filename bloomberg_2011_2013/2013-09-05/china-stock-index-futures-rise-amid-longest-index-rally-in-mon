China ’s  stocks  fell for the first
time in five days, led by material producers and steelmakers,
after valuations for the benchmark index climbed to the highest
level since June.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. and Jiangxi Copper Co.
declined at least 1.7 percent, sending a gauge of  material
producers  to the biggest loss among industry groups. Baoshan
Iron & Steel Co., the biggest-listed steelmaker, slipped after
rallying yesterday on speculation steelmakers with excess land
would benefit from government land reform. China  Merchants Bank 
Co. gained 1.9 percent after raising 27.5 billion  yuan  ($4.5
billion) in the Shanghai portion of a rights offer.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.2 percent to 2,122.43
at the close. The index’s 4-day gain was its longest stretch of
gains in a month as signs of economic improvement boosted
material stocks. China’s official manufacturing gauge jumped to
a 16-month high in August, while a measure from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics showed the largest gain since 2010.  “The economic data has been good, but investors are still
trying to see if we’ve bottomed, said Du Liang, an analyst from
Shanxi Securities Co. ‘‘Stocks are likely to fall in the near
term as there are a lack of drivers.’’  The CSI 300 Index slipped 0.4 percent to 2,341.74, while
the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  rose 1.3 percent. The Hang
Seng China AH Premium index fell to 99.71, the lowest level
since January. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index added 0.7
percent in  New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai index has climbed 8.8 percent since reaching
this year’s low on June 27, as reports ranging from industrial
production to  money supply  signaled the economy is stabilizing.
It’s valued at 8.6 times its projected 12-month earnings, the
highest since June 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Less Risk’  ‘‘There is less risk in the near term,” said  Zhu Haibin ,
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s China economist in  Hong Kong . “But this
round of recovery will not be a strong one and won’t last
long.”  Analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  last month see growth
slowing to 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter, the weakest in
more than four years, after 7.5 percent in the July-September
period, based on median estimates.  A gauge of material stocks in the CSI 300 fell 1.5 percent,
the most among 10 industry groups. Aluminum Corp. of China, the
biggest producer of the metal, retreated 2.1 percent to 3.34
yuan. Jiangxi Copper, the largest copper producer, declined 1.7
percent to 16.67 yuan. Zhongjin Gold Corp. lost 2.8 percent to
10.42 yuan.  Steelmakers Drop  Baoshan Steel, the biggest-listed steelmaker, declined 0.7
percent to 4.47 yuan, after gaining 5.9 percent yesterday. Wuhan
Iron & Steel Co. fell 2.9 percent to 2.39 yuan. The Ministry of
Land and Resources denied an unidentified media report that said
it issued a document to local governments on expanding rural
land use rights transfers, the China Securities Journal reported
today, citing an unidentified official from the ministry.  Steelmakers have large land reserves so they will benefit
from government land reforms, Capital Securities Corp. analyst
Li Xiaolu said by phone yesterday. Policy makers are drafting
proposals on how to implement Premier  Li Keqiang ’s urbanization
vision that will be presented to the Communist Party’s top
leaders at a meeting in November.  China Merchants Bank gained 1.9 percent to 10.66 yuan. The
lender said last month it planned to raise 34.8 billion yuan by
offering 3.07 billion Shanghai-listed shares at 9.29 yuan each
and 680.4 million in Hong Kong for HK$11.68. The results of the
Hong Kong sale will be announced Sept. 26.  Financial Street Holdings Co., a Beijing-based developer,
added 1.3 percent to 5.46 yuan, paring this year’s loss to 19
percent. Citic Securities’ analyst Chen Cong said the stock was
trading at a 50 percent discount to its book value.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 15 percent
higher than the 30-day average for this time of day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
