Canola futures declined, extending
the longest slump in more than two years, on signs that farmers
are harvesting the biggest crop ever in  Canada , the world’s
largest grower.  Production may climb to 14.7 million metric tons, exceeding
the record of 14.6 million tons in 2011,  Statistics Canada   said 
on Aug. 21.  Alberta , the second-largest grower, said 87 percent
of the province’s crop was in good to excellent condition as of
Aug. 27, and government reports show yields are average to above
average in southwestern  Manitoba .  “I’m hearing of record yields,” Jerry Klassen, the
manager of Canadian operations and trading at GAP SA Grains &
Produits, said in a telephone interview from Winnipeg. “The
trade is anticipating a fair amount of farmer selling here over
the next couple of weeks.”  Canola futures for November settlement fell 0.4 percent to
C$514.80 ($489.96) a ton at 10:31 a.m. on ICE Futures Exchange
in Winnipeg, extending the longest slide for the most-active
contract since March 15, 2011. Prices are down 12 percent this
year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
