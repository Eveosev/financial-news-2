Canadian stocks rose, as BlackBerry
Ltd. advanced and energy companies climbed after the  U.S.
Congress  took a step toward authorizing a military strike in
Syria.  BlackBerry gained 1.8 percent to C$11.48, bringing its gain
this week to 7.8 percent, after a report yesterday the mobile
phone maker aims to find a buyer by November. Inter Pipeline
Ltd. gained 1.6 percent to lead energy companies higher as oil
futures rose.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s/TSX Composite Index rose 25.29
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,783.10 as of 9:58 a.m. in Toronto.
Trading volume was 2.2 percent higher than the 30-day average at
this time of the day.  Oil prices  climbed from the lowest price in more than a
week after a U.S. Senate panel yesterday voted to authorize
President Barack Obama to conduct a limited U.S. military
operation against Syria because of its use of chemical weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
