Toshiba Corp. (6502) , a Japanese maker of
flash-memory chips and nuclear reactors, plans to sell 150,000
units to homeowners in Europe in the next three years to help
manage and track energy use.  The Tokyo-based company will begin selling the systems in
 France  today, Toshiba said in a statement. The units log current
and cumulative power consumption and can also track household
carbon dioxide emissions.  Toshiba wants to expand sales to the U.K. and Germany,
according to the statement.  “Europe is expected to see dramatic growth in penetration
rates of home automation, energy management and security systems
in the years to 2020,” the company said in the statement,
adding that France plans to introduce smart meters beginning in
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
