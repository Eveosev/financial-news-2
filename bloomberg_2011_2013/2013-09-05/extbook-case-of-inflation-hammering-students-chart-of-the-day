The cost of college textbooks has
more than doubled since the end of 2001 even as prices for other
books retreated, illustrating soaring tuition isn’t the only
thing to blame for rising higher education bills as the school
year begins.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows university textbook prices
surged 102 percent through July from December 2001 while the
costs for recreational books declined 1.5 percent. Over the same
period, the consumer price index measuring the cost of all goods
and services rose 32 percent.  “We’re on an untenable trajectory -- we keep on stretching
the proverbial rubber band, and at some point it’s going to come
back and hit us in the face and it’s going to hurt,”  Watson
Scott Swail , president and chief executive officer of the
Educational Policy Institute, said of the climbing textbook
costs that limit access to education. “It’s one of the reasons
that students drop out, because it’s the unforeseen cost.”  Greater availability of digital options for textbooks, as
well as a wider market for used books, may help ease cost
pressures, the Government Accountability Office said in a June
report.  Schools and publishers are offering more information to
students regarding textbook costs in order to comply with the
Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, which mandated that
they provide details such as the alternate textbook formats
available and their prices, the GAO said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
