Carbon permits advanced to the
highest in almost five months after the benchmark contract
breached a technical resistance level, power prices climbed and
the European Union announced its allocation of allowances to
polluters.  December permits rose as much as 9.9 percent to 5.02 euros
($6.61) a metric ton on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange,
the highest since April 9. German baseload power for 2014 gained
as much as 2 percent to 38.60 euros a megawatt-hour, after
reaching a record low of 36.05 euros on Aug. 6.  The European Commission said after the close of trading it
will give factories 5.7 percent fewer permits than they sought
in member-state plans submitted to the commission earlier this
year. The handout will end a seven-month delay that helped lift
prices from an all-time low of 2.46 euros a ton on April 17.  “Traders betting on lower carbon prices seem to be buying
back futures,” Mark Owen-Lloyd, a trader at Clean Energy Group
Ltd. in London, said today by e-mail. German next-year power
“broke its down trend” when prices exceeded 37.25 euros a
megawatt-hour, he said.  Carbon closed at 4.98 euros a ton in  London , breaching the
200-day moving average of 4.64 euros, which had been identified
by Krzysztof Piatek, a trader at Vertis Kornyezetvedelmi
Penzugyi zrt in Budapest, as a technical resistance when prices
peaked at the moving average on Aug. 28.  The permit distribution delay comes as countries had to
adjust to the start of the EU emission trading system’s third
phase, which began in January and runs until 2020. As of this
year, utilities in western Europe no longer get free permits,
while east European generators will initially have to buy 30
percent of their allowances at auctions, rising to 100 percent
by 2020.  Under EU rules, allocation to individual companies were cut
across all sectors because countries applied for more permits
than available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
