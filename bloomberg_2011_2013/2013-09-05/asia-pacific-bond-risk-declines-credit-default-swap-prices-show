The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 1 basis point to 155 basis
points as of 8:44 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest level
since Aug. 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 1 basis point to
120 as of 10:25 a.m. in Sydney, according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. The benchmark, which rose 1.2 basis points last month,
is on track for its lowest level since Sept. 3, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1 basis point to 89
basis points as of 9:09 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The gauge is set for its lowest level since May 28,
CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
