Alberta power prices reached maximum
rates for a third day as heat stoked demand and the provinceâ€™s
largest imported electricity source was down for maintenance.  Supplies were reduced by a failure on the inter-tie from
British Columbia that serves Alberta and a lack of wind power,
said the  Alberta Electric System Operator , which asked residents
to use less. The high temperature  in Calgary  reached 27 degrees
Celsius (81 Fahrenheit) today, compared with a seasonal
historical average of 19, according to Environment  Canada .  Posted pool prices for Alberta  electricity  spiked to
C$999.99, the maximum allowed under provincial regulations, at 2
p.m. local time from a low of C$20.05 earlier in the day. Prices
reached the maximum for several hours yesterday and Sept. 3.  Environment Canada expects maximum temperatures to cool
into the mid-teens through the weekend, and mid-to-low-20s into
next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
