The French government delayed the
start of an environmental toll on trucks by three months to Jan.
1, citing persistent glitches with the system.  A group led by Autostrade per l’Italia SpA will use beacons
and satellite tracking to charge trucks using 15,000 kilometers
(8,800 miles) of non-toll national roads. Trucks already pay
tolls on French highways.  The delay creates a revenue shortfall for the government,
and comes as a boon for trucking companies including  Norbert
Dentressangle SA (GND)  and  STEF (STF)  SA, which may struggle to pass on the
tax to customers already hit by Europe’s economic woes.  The central government has  said  it expects to get 780
million euros ($1.02 billion) a year from the new tax, which
will be used to bolster transport infrastructure. Local
governments are to get 160 million euro annually from the levy,
and the group led by Autostrade is due to get 230 million euros
per year to operate, maintain and reimburse costs for the
construction of the system.  French electronics company  Thales SA (HO) , national railroad
operator SNCF, Vivendi SA’s SFR, and software company Groupe
Steria SCA are partners of Autostrade in the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
