Gold fell to the lowest in more than
a week as better-than-expected U.S. economic data reinforced the
case for the  Federal Reserve  to slow stimulus.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing
index rose to 58.6 in August, a report from the Tempe, Arizona-based group showed. The median forecast called for a drop to 55.
A reading greater than 50 indicates expansion. Gold has declined
18 percent this year on speculation that the Fed will scale back
bond buying as the economy improves. The Bloomberg  Dollar Index ,
a gauge against 10 major currencies, rose as much as 0.6
percent.  “Stronger U.S. data is getting the market jittery again,”
Tom Power, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The
strength in the dollar is working against gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1.2 percent to
settle at $1,373 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
after dropping to $1,364.70, the lowest since Aug. 22.  Earlier, the metal rose as much as 0.7 percent as the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted yesterday to authorize
President  Barack Obama  to conduct a limited military operation
in Syria, boosting the appeal of haven assets.  Prices retreated 1.6 percent yesterday, the most in two
months, as the U.S. faced opposition from Russia on the military
strike.  Bullion has gained 16 percent from a 34-month low reached
on June 28 as physical demand surged and demand for gold as a
safe haven increased on increased concern about escalating
tension in  Middle East .  Silver futures for December delivery slumped 0.7 percent to
$23.255 an ounce.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery slid 0.8 percent to $1,482.10 an ounce.  Palladium futures for December delivery fell 1.6 percent to
$687.20 an ounce. The price dropped for the sixth straight
session, the longest slump in almost 16 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
