Porsche AG, the  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  unit
that builds the 911 sports car, said it will reach a target of
selling more than 200,000 vehicles a year in 2015 or 2016, about
three years earlier than initially planned.  Investments in expanding and modernizing factories in the
region around its Stuttgart,  Germany , hometown will exceed 1
billion euros ($1.32 billion) by 2018, and the manufacturer
plans to decide on a new model line next year, Chief Executive
Officer  Matthias Mueller  said.  “Porsche has made an enormous leap forward over the last
years,” Mueller said today at a press conference at the
carmaker’s museum near division headquarters in Stuttgart.  Earnings from its luxury brands helped Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW,  Europe ’s biggest carmaker, cushion the fallout from
economic woes in its home region, where demand for new cars is
falling to a 20-year low amid unemployment rates lingering near
record highs. Porsche accounted for 1.29 billion euros of group
first-half operating profit of 5.78 billion euros, the third-largest earnings contributor after the Audi premium unit and the
mass-market VW car nameplate.  The effects of the European sovereign-debt crisis are far
from over, and “the political and economical framework
conditions worldwide bear significant uncertainties,” Mueller
said.  Adding Dealerships  Porsche, which ranks first at Volkswagen in terms of profit
per vehicle, plans to expand its sales network 33 percent by
2018 as demand for upscale vehicles jumps in  emerging markets 
such as  China  and the division adds models. The carmaker, which
also builds the Cayenne sport-utility vehicle, is investing 200
million euros annually to increase the number of dealerships to
1,000 outlets in five years from about 750 in early 2013.  The division is adding to its line-up after Volkswagen
integrated Porsche as a business just over a year ago. Porsche
will be showing the 918 Spyder, an $845,000 limited-run hybrid
supercar that will be its most expensive model ever, at the
 Frankfurt car show  beginning next week.  The expansion is part of a push by Porsche to boost annual
sales as Volkswagen targets becoming the world’s biggest
automaker by 2018. Porsche handed over a record 143,096 vehicles
to customers in 2012, an increase of 22 percent.  Eight-month sales rose 15 percent from a year earlier to
“about” 107,000 cars and SUVs, keeping Porsche on track to
cross the 150,000-delivery threshold this year for the first
time, Mueller said.  918 Spyder  The 918 Spyder is scheduled to go on sale later this year,
joining a line-up that includes revamped versions of the Boxster
roadster and Cayman sports car that were made lighter and faster
to shore up Porsche’s reputation for performance. The carmaker
plans to roll out the compact Macan SUV in showrooms in early
2014, and it introduced a new version of the Panamera four-door
coupe at the Shanghai auto show in April.  After the Macan enters the fleet, Porsche is considering
adding a smaller version of the Panamera and a $250,000 sports
car that would challenge the Ferrari 458 Italia.  Mueller said the Macan is targeted to contribute about
50,000 units to Porsche’s annual vehicle sales. The model will
help Porsche and VW to reap cost synergies 1 billion euros
starting in 2015, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
