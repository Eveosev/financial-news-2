Euro-area stocks  may drop as much as
10 percent by the end of October if the region’s benchmark index
closes below its 50-day moving average, a technical analyst from
ING Bank NV said.  Closing below 2,739 will confirm a bearish trend for the
 Euro Stoxx 50 (SX5E)  Index, with the next support at 2,673. The gauge
may fall as low as 2,470 in the coming weeks as a so-called
broadening formation develops, according to Roelof-Jan van den Akker.  A broadening formation is a pattern that shows uncertainty,
with sharp volatile price movements within its boundaries.  “Momentum is deteriorating, confirming the current
difficult status of the market,” Van den Akker said by
telephone from Amsterdam. “Right now, it looks like a normal
decline without panic. But I don’t see any signs of a bottom
within this decline, which tells me we’re not there yet.”  The Euro Stoxx 50 fell 3.7 percent to 2,721.37 last week
amid concern that possible military action by the U.S. against
Syria may escalate into a larger conflict in the  Middle East  and
push up  oil prices . The gauge rose 0.6 percent to 2,774.45 at
1:44 p.m. in London today.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study price
graphs to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
