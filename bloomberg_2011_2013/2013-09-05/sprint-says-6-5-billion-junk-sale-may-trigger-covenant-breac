Sprint Corp. (S) ’s $6.5 billion bond
sale yesterday, the biggest high-yield offering since 2008, may
result in the company breaking terms of its loans.  The increase in the company’s debt may breach compliance
tests on three credit facilities to its Sprint Communications
unit, according to a company filing. It can avoid a default by
getting “waivers from our lenders, reduce our outstanding
indebtedness or otherwise eliminate our need to comply with
Sprint Communications’ credit facility covenants,” it said.  Sprint is in talks with lenders that provided a revolving
credit facility, a type of debt where money repaid can be
borrowed again, to get a waiver on the covenants. The company
said it will also seek to reach an agreement with lenders of the
other two facilities as a breach of the loan terms may result in
cross defaults of other debt.  “We fully expect to get the required waivers and
anticipate having sufficient cash on hand to repay and terminate
the facilities if we do not,”  Scott Sloat , a spokesman for
Sprint, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Sprint, based in Overland Park,  Kansas , was acquired by
 Japan ’s  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  in July for $21.6 billion. It said Sept.
4 it intends to use the proceeds from the new notes for
“general corporate purposes, which may include, among other
things, redemptions or service requirements of outstanding debt
and network expansion and modernization.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
