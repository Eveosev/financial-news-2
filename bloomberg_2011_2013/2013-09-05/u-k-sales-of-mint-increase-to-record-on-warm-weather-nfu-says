U.K. sales of mint rose to a record
in July as warm weather increased demand for the herb as a
garnish for cold beverages, the National Farmers Union said.  U.K. consumers bought 45 percent more mint than a year
earlier, or about 1.25 million pots, bunches or packages of the
fresh herb, the NFU said in an online  statement  today.
Consumption increased amid “a wider growing trend for cooking
from scratch” and as warm weather spurred more barbecues and
demand for lemonade and Diageo Plc’s Pimm’s, a traditional U.K.
summer beverage that often includes mint as a garnish.  To contact the reporter on this story:
