Gold shipments to  China  from Hong
Kong increased in July as importers took advantage of local
prices that were an average 2.1 percent higher than global
markets and as mainland investors bought jewelry and coins.  Net imports, after deducting flows from China into Hong
Kong, were 113 metric tons, from 101 tons a month earlier,
according to calculations by Bloomberg. Mainland buyers
purchased 129 tons in July, including scrap, compared with 113
tons in June, data from the Hong Kong government showed today.  Gold prices that advanced 18 percent from a 34-month low in
June are attracting buyers in China, which is on track to
overtake  India  as the world’s top bullion consumer this year.
Premiums paid by jewelers on top of spot prices on the Shanghai
Gold Exchange to take physical delivery of the metal were an
average $27 an ounce in China during July, according to
calculations by Bloomberg.  “China’s seeing robust gold sales this year,” said Duan Shihua, a partner at commodities fund Shanghai Leading
Investment Management Ltd. “The high prices in China’s domestic
market in July encouraged importers.”  Gold for immediate delivery in  London  fell 0.2 percent to
$1,389.47 an ounce at 5:00 p.m. Beijing time. Bullion, which
dropped as low as $1,180.50 an ounce on June 28, has declined 17
percent this year.  Shanghai Gold  Bullion of 99.99 percent purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange in July made its firstly monthly gain since January,
advancing by 9.2 percent. It extended gains by 4.4 percent last
month.  China’s total gold consumption this year may jump by 29
percent to reach 1,000 tons, overtaking India to become the
world’s largest gold consumer, according to the World Gold
Council. China and India together account for more than half of
the world’s gold demand, according to the council.  China’s purchases in July were 70 percent higher than the
75.8 tons in the same month last year, according to the data
from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department. Mainland
China doesn’t publish such data.  Exports of gold to Hong Kong from China were 16 tons in
July, according to a separate Statistics Department statement,
compared with 11.7 tons in June and 30 tons in July 2012.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
