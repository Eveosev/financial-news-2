In New Delhi this week, the findings of an ambitious and methodologically inventive survey of Indian linguistic plenitude were made available to the public. The project, called  the People's Linguistic Survey of India , establishes the number of languages currently in circulation at an astonishing 780. The survey, headed by the scholar  Ganesh Devy , and drawing on hundreds of scholars and research workers, is impressive not just for its findings but also for the principles it applied in thinking about India's languages. They dramatically extend, for instance, the official view of India's languages in the Constitution of 1950, which recognizes  22 official languages , or Scheduled Languages. All have their own script and print cultures, and are now sanctified as the "high languages" of modern India. A wider view of Indian languages is taken by the  decadal census  of India. The census lists the 22 official languages and all their recognized dialects and variants (my mother tongue, Oriya, for instance, is divided into Oriya, Bhatri, Proja, Relli and Sambalpuri). Then it also details another  100 "non-scheduled languages"  that either don't have scripts (the major tribal languages for instance, such as Bhili or Munda) or aren't native to India but are still used by a large amount of people (Persian, Arabic). It also provides  comparative figures  across the decades for the number of self-declared speakers of each of these languages. The PLSI survey, though, breaks new ground by  not making distinctions  between languages and dialects, bestowing autonomy on variant forms of major languages with deep roots in local history and geography. And it takes a special interest in languages spoken by very small groups of people, which the state surveys don't do. The survey opens a view of Indian languages that avoids the tracks left by the combined forces of print culture, colonialism, and the Indian state over three centuries. Instead, it adopts the principle that every language expresses a unique worldview and is worthy of the same interest as any other.  It is a view that links the 21st century to the deep Indian past, bypassing some of the anxieties and hierarchies of the new nation-state of the mid-20th century and the colonial state that preceded it, and building from the ground up rather than top-down. In an  interview , Devy stressed that the survey's major advance was its enumeration of the languages of indigenous peoples and the ability to draw revealing portraits of many small languages by aggregating details supplied by its speakers: In a globalizing world where certain languages are repositories of economic power, it is almost inevitable that many of the smaller Indian languages will soon become extinct. But more Indians should know that these languages exist as living forces, both forming, and being formed by, the thoughts of small speech communities in far-flung areas, such as the northeast, the most  language-rich region . Some of the ideas and assumptions that underlie the survey can also be traced to a lecture delivered by Devy to UNESCO in 2008, where he  asserted : The evidence shows that India doesn't have any single language that could be said to be spoken by the majority of Indian people, and so in a sense every Indian language is a minority language -- a fact that is politically enabling rather than disabling. Further, a number of "high languages" owe their status as much to the weight of history and tradition as to their use in the present day. Conversely, "non-scheduled languages" tend to be those whose speakers lack economic or political power.  The networks of influence of language in India are studied in a paper from 2002 by  Rajeshwari V. Pandharipande  that tries to analyze languages in terms of both the number of people who speak them and their "functional power" or dominance in the world: Over the next year,  publishers from several Indian states  will release to the public, and in many languages, the findings of the PLSI surveys. For now, though, the survey's work reminds Indians that their country has a richer human soundscape than any other.
