Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  can’t be sued
by unified groups of homeowners in different states over its
failure to modify mortgages, a federal judge in Boston ruled.  Home-mortgage borrowers in 26 states claimed in lawsuits
that Bank of America mismanaged loan requests under the Home
Affordable Modification Program and sought class-action status
to pursue their cases. The suits were consolidated in Boston.  “Plaintiffs’ claims may well be meritorious; but they rest
on so many individual factual questions that they cannot
sensibly be adjudicated on a classwide basis,” U.S. District
Judge Rya Zobel said in a decision dated yesterday.  Bank of America is one of many mortgage lenders
participating in the U.S. government’s mortgage-modification
program, known as HAMP, designed to prevent mortgage
foreclosures. The homeowners who sued claimed they made all
required trial payments under the plan to the bank and still
didn’t receive permanent loan modifications or written denials
of eligibility by a certain date.  Jerry Dubrowski , a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment on the ruling.  Steve Berman  and Thomas Sobol,
lawyers for the plaintiffs, also didn’t immediately respond to
e-mails.  The case is In re Bank of America Home Affordable
Modification Program Contract Litigation, 10-02193, U.S.
District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
