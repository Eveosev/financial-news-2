Rubber traded near a three-month
high as U.S. car sales expanded more than analyst estimates and
as speculation grew that farmers may disrupt shipments from
 Thailand , the largest producer and exporter.  Rubber for delivery in February advanced as much as 0.8
percent to 283.5 yen a kilogram ($2,837 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, nearing a three-month high of 287.9
yen reached yesterday. Futures swung between gains and losses
and traded at 282.8 yen at 2:16 p.m. local time.  U.S. car and light truck sales rose 17 percent to 1.5
million units in August, the most since May 2007, according to
researcher Autodata Corp. That exceeded the 14 percent rise to
1.47 million that was the average of 10 analyst estimates in a
survey by  Bloomberg News .  “U.S. car sales are positive for rubber demand,” said
Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp.
“Thai farmers’ protest is another support to the market.”  In Thailand, about 3,200 rubber farmers blocked roads in
the southern provinces of Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Trang and Surat
Thani to pressure the government to help boost prices, police
spokesman Piya Uthayo told reporters yesterday.  Tapping of rubber trees may decline because of the
demonstrations, and shipments could be delayed by about a week,
said Luckchai Kittipol, chief executive officer of Thai Hua Pcl,
the country’s third-largest rubber exporter.  Thailand produces about 360,000 tons of rubber a month
during August and September, according to the Association of
Natural Rubber Producing Countries.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.9 percent to 85.65 baht
($2.66) a kilogram today, according to data from the Rubber
Research Institute of Thailand. The contract for January
delivery declined 0.5 percent to 20,585  yuan  ($3,364) a ton on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
