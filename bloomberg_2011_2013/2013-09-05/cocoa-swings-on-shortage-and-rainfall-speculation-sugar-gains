Cocoa swung between gains and losses
in New York and  London  as investors weighed speculation of a
shortage this season and the return of rains in West Africa, the
main producing region. Sugar rose.  Cocoa growing areas in West Africa are forecast to get
rains in the next five days, Kyle Tapley, a meteorologist with
MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said yesterday.
Dryness last month threatened to cut output for next season.
Slower bean deliveries to Ivorian ports are fueling speculation
of a global shortage in the 2012-13 season ending this month.  “We are still looking at a balanced situation for 2012-13,
but there was always a risk for a slight deficit,”  Kona Haque ,
a London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., said by phone
today. “If the mid-crop arrivals are tapering off and turn out
to be smaller than expected, we may have to revise the 2012-13
balance down.”  Cocoa for delivery in December climbed 0.2 percent to
$2,500 a metric ton by 7:36 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. It rose as much as 0.7 percent and fell as much as 0.2
percent in earlier trade. Cocoa for delivery in the same month
added 0.1 percent to 1,656 pounds ($2,590) a ton on NYSE Liffe
in London, after advancing as much as 0.7 percent and declining
as much as 0.1 percent.  Ivory Coast  is harvesting its mid-crop, the smaller of two
annuals harvests. Deliveries to ports were 1.28 million tons
from Oct. 1 to June 30, according to the country’s ministries of
finance and agriculture. That’s smaller than arrivals of 1.34
million tons estimated by KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities
Risk Analysis in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania  on July 2.  Shortage  Cocoa supplies are forecast to be 11,000 tons higher than
demand in 2012-13, according to Macquarie. The bank sees a
shortage of 119,000 tons for next season. The cost of cocoa
butter relative to the price of beans soared to the highest
since 2008 in  Europe  last month, according to three traders with
direct knowledge of the sales.  “Demand is strong,” Haque said. “Demand for butter is
out there. If there’s any concern over yield or delays to the
next main crop, the physical buyers may be looking to get their
hands on what they can now.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$1.17 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for November delivery fell
0.1 percent to $1,776 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Raw sugar for delivery in October climbed 0.1 percent to
16.40 cents a pound in  New York . White, or refined, sugar for
delivery in the same month advanced 0.2 percent to $480.90 a ton
in London.    To contact the reporters on this story:
