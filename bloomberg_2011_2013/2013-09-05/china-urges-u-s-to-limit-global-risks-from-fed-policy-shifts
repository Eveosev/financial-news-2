China urged the U.S. to limit global
risks from shifts in monetary policy, while adding that there’s
no need for a rescue plan for  emerging markets , as Group of 20
leaders met at a summit in  St. Petersburg , Russia.  An exit from monetary-easing policies poses a major
challenge for the world economy, Vice Finance Minister  Zhu Guangyao  told reporters in the Russian city today, speaking
through a translator. The U.S. should be mindful of spillover
effects, said Zhu, who called for greater coordination between
nations.  Emerging markets, which helped pull the world out of a
recession after the global financial crisis, now face an exodus
of cash and sliding currencies in anticipation of the Federal
Reserve’s eventual tapering of its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases. Developed economies are turning into global growth
engines as some emerging-market counterparts decelerate, the
International Monetary Fund told G-20 leaders today.  Zhu said that now is “no time to be arrogant” on monetary
policies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
