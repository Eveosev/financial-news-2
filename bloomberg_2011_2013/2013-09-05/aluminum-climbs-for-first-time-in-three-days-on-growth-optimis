Aluminum advanced for the first time
in three days, rebounding from a four-week low, after the U.S.
Federal Reserve said a recovery in the world’s largest economy
was intact.  Aluminum for delivery in three months increased as much as
0.8 percent to $1,804 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and was at $1,801.25 at 12:55 p.m. in  Tokyo . The metal touched
$1,785 yesterday, the lowest level since Aug. 7. Copper was
little changed at $7,128 a ton.  “There’s some good buying interest below $1,800 for
aluminum,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea Exchange
Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul . Copper has the potential to rally
from a 1.7 percent drop yesterday, he said.  Copper futures for delivery in December were little changed
at $3.2425 a pound on the Comex in New York. Futures for
delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.8
percent to 51,620  yuan  ($8,434) a ton.  On the LME, zinc advanced, while lead declined and nickel
and tin were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
