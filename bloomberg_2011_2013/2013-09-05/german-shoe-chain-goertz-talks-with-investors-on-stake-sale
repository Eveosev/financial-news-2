Ludwig Goertz GmbH, a 240-store
German shoe chain, opened talks with several investors
interested in buying a stake in the 138-year-old company.  Goertz, based in Hamburg, started discussions with
“various potential partners” on Sept. 2, according to an
internal memorandum obtained by Bloomberg News. Those don’t
include online retailer Otto Group, which was reported to have
been in talks last month, the company said in a one-page memo.  Otto Group , which owns online brands including bonprix and
shopping 24, planned to acquire a minority stake in the shoe
chain with an option to raise its stake to more than 50 percent,
German newspaper Die Welt reported last month, without saying
where it got the information. Goertz and Otto both declined to
comment at the time, Die Welt said.  Goertz will check all expressions of interest in coming
weeks, according to the memorandum. A spokeswoman for the
company declined to comment on the negotiations.  Goertz ’s like-for-like sales rose in the period from
January to August, outpacing the broader market, according to
the document. The retailer had sales of about 400 million euros
($524 million) last year.  Otto Group operates 123 companies in more than 20 countries
and had revenue of about 11.8 billion euros in the financial
year through February, according to its website.  A spokesman for Otto Group declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
