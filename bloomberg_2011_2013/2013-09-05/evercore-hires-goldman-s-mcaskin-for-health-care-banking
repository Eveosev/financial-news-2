Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
 Roger Altman , hired Matthew McAskin as a senior managing
director in its health-care group.  McAskin was previously co-head of health-care services
investment banking at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was

transaction volume across all industries has risen in the second
and third quarters this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Health care represents one of the largest and most active
industries for investment-banking services,” Chief Executive
Officer Ralph Schlosstein said in the statement.  McAskin received an undergraduate degree in economics from
the University of Michigan and MBA degrees from  Columbia
Business School  and  London Business School , according to the
statement.  “We are extraordinarily pleased to have a banker of
Matthew’s quality and experience join Evercore,” Altman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
