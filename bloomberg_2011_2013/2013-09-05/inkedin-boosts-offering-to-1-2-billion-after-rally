LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , owner of the world’s
most popular professional-networking website, boosted its
planned share sale by 20 percent to $1.2 billion.  LinkedIn is selling 5.38 million shares of its Class A
stock for $223 a share in an offering that’s expected to close
on Sept. 10, the  Mountain View , California-based company said
yesterday in a statement. That’s a 6.7 percent discount to the
closing stock price yesterday.  Membership on LinkedIn has more than doubled since the
company’s initial public offering in 2011, spurring a fivefold
 increase  in the stock. LinkedIn has raised revenue by adding
features to keep users on the site for longer and by raising
subscription prices.  LinkedIn  rose  1.2 percent to $241.81 at 10:09 a.m. in  New
York .  The offering is about three times the size of LinkedIn’s
IPO, even as the company is selling fewer than two-thirds the
number of shares. The underwriters, which include JPMorgan Chase
& Co. and Morgan Stanley, have been granted a 30-day option to
purchase as many as 807,174 additional shares.  LinkedIn increased the offering amount from Sept. 3, when
it announced plans to raise $1 billion. Selling new shares
dilutes the stakes of existing equity holders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
