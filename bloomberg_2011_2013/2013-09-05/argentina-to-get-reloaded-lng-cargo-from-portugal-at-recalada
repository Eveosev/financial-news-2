Argentina, which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a reloaded spot cargo from  Portugal , according to ship
tracking data.  The LNG Taurus, with a capacity of about 127,000 cubic
meters, will arrive Sept. 9 at Recalada port near  Buenos Aires ,
according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. The tanker docked at Portugal’s Sines LNG-receiving
terminal Aug. 22, where it loaded the supercooled gas from
storage.  REN Atlantico Terminal de GNL SA operates the receiving
terminal in Sines, according to the company’s  website . Portugal
doesn’t produce LNG.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF closed a tender on May 6 to buy seven LNG cargoes
for delivery to  Bahia Blanca . Enarsa and YPF have issued seven
spot tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
