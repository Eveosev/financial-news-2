The U.K. government’s overhaul of
the civil service is “bound to fail” because it’s
strategically incoherent and lacks clear leadership, a panel of
lawmakers said.  Members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords
should draw up a program and timetable for comprehensive change
for Whitehall, as the government service is known, the cross-party  Public Administration Select Committee  said in a report
today. Whitehall is the London street on which many ministries
have their headquarters.  “Whitehall is a Rolls-Royce machine, but it is sorely in
need of modernization and repair,” the committee chairman,
Bernard Jenkin from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s  Conservative
Party , said in an e-mailed statement. “Much more radical
analysis and change than are currently contemplated” are
“essential if governments are to govern successfully.”  There has been increased tension between elected ministers
and civil servants, the panel said, noting how individual
officials had been blamed for the failed franchising process for
the main West Coast rail line and the dissolution of the Border
Agency.  “Tensions between ministers and officials have become all
too evident in recent years,” the committee said. “There is a
fundamental question about why ministers feel some civil
servants are resistant to what they want and this question has
not been considered in any systematic way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
