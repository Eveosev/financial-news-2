Light Louisiana Sweet and other Gulf
of Mexico crudes weakened relative to West Texas Intermediate
after supplies at WTI’s home in Cushing,  Oklahoma , fell and
refinery rates increased.  The premiums for LLS and Heavy Louisiana Sweet dropped
after the Energy Information Administration reported that
Cushing  stockpiles  fell by 1.83 million barrels, the most in
four weeks, to 34.8 million on Aug. 30. Supplies at the hub have
fallen from a record 51.9 million on Jan. 11. Refinery
utilization rose to 91.7 percent, a six-week high.  LLS’s premium to WTI narrowed 75 cents to $3.65 a barrel at
3:49 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HLS weakened
by 30 cents to a $4.60 premium.  Declining stockpiles in Cushing strengthen land-locked WTI
against waterborne crudes like the European benchmark, Brent,
and oils from the Gulf. The WTI-Brent differential narrowed to
$6.89 from $7.68 yesterday.  “We could see some near-term tightening on that WTI-Brent
spread,” said Adam Wise, who helps manage a $6 billion oil and
gas bond portfolio as a managing director at Manulife Asset
Management in  Boston . “Refinery utilization is up a bit
week-over-week, so there’s a stronger draw that which could be
price supportive of WTI.”  Sour crudes from the Gulf also slipped against WTI. Mars
Blend weakened by 60 cents to a discount of 25 cents. Poseidon’s
discount widened by 95 cents to $1.25. Southern Green lost 60
cents versus WTI to a $1.50 discount. Thunder Horse crude
weakened by 35 cents to a premium of $2.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
