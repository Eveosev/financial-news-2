Chinese feed mills will likely buy
corn from South America next year if cheaper than U.S. supplies,
Cao Jingang, CP Group’s China director of corn purchasing, said
at a conference in Beijing hosted by Cofeed.com.
* Private companies are confident that the govt will allow the
trade after successful clearance of first shipment from
Argentina under a quarantine pact signed last year by state-owned COFCO, Cao said
* Private companies didn’t buy Argentina corn earlier this year,
which was $20 per ton cheaper, because of uncertainties about
whether the quarantine authorities would allow the shipment, Cao
