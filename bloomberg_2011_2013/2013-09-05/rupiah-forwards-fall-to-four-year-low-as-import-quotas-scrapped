Rupiah forwards fell to a four-year
low on concern government measures to tackle inflation will
weigh on the trade deficit, which reached a record in July.  Indonesia  scrapped import quotas for beef, chillies and
shallots to restrain consumer-price gains, the Jakarta Globe
reported yesterday, citing Trade Minister  Gita Wirjawan . The
 trade shortfall  surged to $2.3 billion as purchases from
overseas increased 6.5 percent and exports fell for a 16th month,
official data showed this week. Inflation accelerated to 8.79
percent in August, the fastest since January 2009.  “We are closely watching developments on how the trade
deficit is addressed, as that’s the biggest concern weighing on
the rupiah now,” said Mika Martumpal, head of treasury research
and strategy at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “The forwards
will impact the local  spot market  as they’re traded by investors
who are also active domestically.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 1.3 percent to
11,785 per dollar as of 10:13 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reached 11,799 earlier, the
lowest level since April 30, 2009, and traded 5.6 percent weaker
than the spot rate, biggest gap since Aug. 27. The rupiah was
steady at 11,128 per dollar, prices from local banks show.  A  fixing  used to settle the forwards was set at 11,491 per
dollar yesterday, 3.2 percent weaker than the spot rate,
according to the Association of Banks in  Singapore . One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, rose 61 basis points, or 0.61
percentage point, to 19.53 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Wide Spread  “The bid-and-offer spread for the onshore rupiah is very
wide as people are trying to find which rates are more
reflective of the market,” CIMB Niaga’s Martumpal said. Banks
may offer to sell dollars at about 11,500 rupiah and buy them at
11,000 rupiah, compared with a difference of about five to 10
rupiah during normal market conditions, he said.  The yield on sovereign bonds due May 2023 rose one basis
point to 8.77 percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association. Indonesia will offer notes due March 2024 in
exchange for securities maturing in 2013 through 2018 in a debt
swap today, according to a statement on the debt management
office’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
