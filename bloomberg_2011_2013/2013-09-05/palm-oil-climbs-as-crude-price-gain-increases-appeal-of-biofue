Palm oil  advanced as strengthening
crude  oil prices  increased the appeal of vegetable oils as
biofuel feedstock.  Palm for November delivery rose 0.5 percent to close at
2,410 ringgit ($729) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives. Palm oil for physical delivery in September was at
2,415 ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery gained
as much as 0.8 percent to $108.04 a barrel in electronic trading
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange as a U.S. Senate committee
approved military strikes on Syria, heightening the threat of a
wider conflict in the Middle East. Use of palm oil for fuel is
expected to advance 11 percent to 6.34 million tons in 2013,
according to Hamburg-based research company Oil World.  “Because of the way energy prices have gone up, there’s a
sudden increase in demand for biodiesel as well,” Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz Risk Management Services
Pvt., said by phone from Mumbai. “Production is expected to
rise but a lot of demand could also resurface. Any dips are
finding buying opportunities from destinations.”  India, the biggest importer, may buy when prices drop and
start to restock before the Diwali festival which falls in
November this year, said Gnanasekar.  While palm is harvested all year round, output is typically
highest from July to October each year. Malaysia is the largest
producer after Indonesia.  Refined palm oil for January delivery declined 0.3 percent
to close at 5,570  yuan  ($910) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange.  Soybean oil  ended unchanged at 7,188 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for November delivery declined 0.7 percent to
$13.4325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
delivery in December fell 0.2 percent to 43.83 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
