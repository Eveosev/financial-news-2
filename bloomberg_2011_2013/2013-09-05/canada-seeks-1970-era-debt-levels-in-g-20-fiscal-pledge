Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  pledged to return his government’s debt level to the
lowest since the 1970s as part of commitments by Group of 20
nations to establish longer-term fiscal strategies.  Canada  is targeting a debt-to-gross domestic product ratio
of 25 percent by 2021, Harper said in a statement today from a
G-20 leaders’ summit in the Russian city of  St. Petersburg .
Canada’s federal  budget , released in March, projected debt would
be 34 percent of GDP this year.  G-20 countries have pledged to offer up fiscal strategies
at the summit to make debt levels more sustainable. Harper
reiterated today his government plans to eliminate its deficit
in 2015, which would allow it to safeguard its status as the
only Group of Seven country with a stable AAA rating from
 Standard & Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.  “We’re going to encourage our colleagues here to move in
that direction as well,” Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty , who is accompanying Harper in St. Petersburg, told
reporters today. “Fiscal sustainability is fundamental.”  Flaherty said the 25 percent debt target is “realistic.”  That target could be brought forward if growth is
“significantly” above expectations, Harper said in the
statement.  Lower Ratios  “Lower debt-to-GDP ratios will result in lower taxes for
Canadians and a strong investment climate that supports job
creation and economic growth across the country,” Harper said.  In its last budget, the government forecast its debt would
decline to 28.1 percent of GDP by the fiscal year starting April
2017.  A 25 percent debt ratio would be the federal government’s
lowest since 1978, according to data on the finance department’s
 website . The ratio was 35 percent when Harper came to power in
2006.  Flaherty’s last budget plan, delivered March 21, seeks to
limit spending growth over the next five years to the rate of
inflation, which if successful, would be the slowest pace since
the country last eliminated the deficit in the 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
