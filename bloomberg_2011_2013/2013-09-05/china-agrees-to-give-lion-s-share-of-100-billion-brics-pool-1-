China  will contribute $41 billion to
a $100 billion pool of currency reserves the BRICS countries are
forming to guard against financial shocks, the nations’ leaders
said.  Russia, India and Brazil will each add $18 billion to the
pool, while South Africa will provide $5 billion, according to a
statement following an informal meeting today of the countries
at the Group of 20 summit in  St. Petersburg , Russia.  Leaders from some of the largest emerging market economies
are combining resources as they seek to shield against
“unintended negative spillovers” from unconventional monetary
policies in developed economies, according to the statement.
They also agreed to seed a new development bank with $50 billion
of capital.  “We see the temporary difficulties of some BRICS countries
mainly as difficulties in terms of international balance of
payments,” Chinese Vice Finance Minister  Zhu Guangyao  told
reporters in translated remarks. “The policy options in
response to such typical balance-of-payments difficulties
include increasing interest rates or devaluing currencies.”  Instituting  capital controls , as has been done in the past,
is “out of the question” now, Zhu said.  South Africa’s rand has depreciated 16.9 percent against
the dollar this year, the most among 24 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. India’s rupee was second worst,
depreciating 16.8 percent, while the Chinese currency has
strengthened 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
