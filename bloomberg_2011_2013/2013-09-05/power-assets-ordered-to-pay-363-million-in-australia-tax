Cheung Kong  Infrastructure Holdings
Ltd. and  Power Assets Holdings Ltd. (6) , controlled by Asia’s
richest man  Li Ka-shing , must pay A$776 million ($711 million)
in back taxes in  Australia , a judge ruled.  Australia Federal Court Justice Michelle Gordon on Aug. 30
in  Melbourne  issued two orders without holding a trial at the
request of Australia’s deputy commissioner of taxation after
Cheung Kong Infrastructure and Power Assets failed to provide
addresses where they could be served with the tax office’s
lawsuit.  “Cheung Kong’s failure to take that step is continuing and
occasioning unnecessary delay and prejudice to the
commissioner,” Gordon wrote in her ruling. She said the same
about Power Assets.  The two companies owe taxes from 2000 to 2009, according to
complaints filed June 14. Cheung Kong Infrastructure and Power
Assets are the primary electricity network owners in Victoria,
holding a 51 percent stake in two distribution networks,
according to the Australian power regulator. They also have a
200-year lease on South Australia’s distribution network.  Power Assets will continue to defend the case, said Mimi
Yeung, a spokeswoman at the energy company.  Gordon ordered Cheung Kong Infrastructure to pay A$380
million in back taxes and Power Assets to pay A$396 million.  “This is just a one-off kind of event, and was most likely
caused by a different reading of Australia’s tax laws,” said
Simon Yeung, an analyst at Citic Securities International Co.  Cheung Kong Infrastructure fell 0.8 percent to HK$53 as of
1:50 p.m. in Hong Kong trading. Power Assets gained 1.6 percent
to HK$68.75.  The cases are DCOT v  Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings
Ltd. (1)  VID515/2013 and DCOT v Power Assets Holdings Ltd.
