Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  sold its
largest structured notes outside the U.S. in six years, raising
115 million euros ($151.5 million) from securities tied to
swaps.  The 15-year notes will initially pay coupons based on the
rate for 10-year euro constant-maturity swaps, benchmarks that
measure the cost of exchanging floating rate and fixed interest
payments through the swaps market, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The sale was the New York-based bankâ€™s largest
outside its home market since it raised 230 million euros in
August 2007, the data show.  Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in  London ,
declined to comment on the notes.  Investors in the securities will receive an additional
payment from the fourth year onwards based on the difference
between 10-and two-year swap rates, Bloomberg data show. The
1.61 percentage-point gap between the two rates is the widest
since January 2011, the data show.  A constant maturity swap is a variation of an interest rate
swap where the floating interest portion is reset periodically.  Goldman raised $552.8 million from selling 31 structured
notes outside the U.S. this year, up from $503.4 million in the
same period last year, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
