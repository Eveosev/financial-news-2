The amount of sugar waiting to be
loaded at ports in top producer  Brazil  fell 7.4 percent over the
past week as vessels headed for  Indonesia  and the Black Sea,
data from Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda. showed.  Sugar waiting to be loaded at the ports of Recife, Maceio,
Vitoria, Paranagua and Santos, the country’s biggest, amounted
to 1.64 million metric tons as of yesterday, e-mailed data from
the Recife, Brazil-based shipping agency showed. That’s down
from about 1.77 million tons a week earlier.  Vessels scheduled to go to Indonesia were set to take
129,860 tons of sweetener, while ships bound for the Black Sea
region would take 124,500 tons, the data showed. Another 112,600
tons were bound for  Algeria , where Cevital operates two
refineries. Ships were also headed to countries including
Tunisia, China and  Malaysia , according to Williams Brasil.  China was the world’s biggest raw sugar importer last
season and Indonesia is forecast to be the top buyer this year,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Raw sugar for delivery in October was 0.3 percent higher at
16.43 cents a pound by 5:13 a.m. on the ICE Futures U.S.
exchange in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
