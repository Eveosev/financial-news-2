Rubber futures declined for a second
day as a drop in the Chinese market increased concern demand may
weaken in the world’s largest consumer.  The February contract fell as much as 0.8 percent to 279.3
yen a kilogram ($2,800 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange and traded at 280.9 yen at 11:53 a.m. local time.  China ’s stocks fell the most in two weeks, led by material
producers and port operators. Chinese leaders are extending a
clampdown on credit, prompting analysts from JPMorgan Chase &
Co. to Societe Generale SA to caution that the economy is
vulnerable to weakening after the pickup so far this quarter.  “Futures lost upward steam as concern about  China’s
economy  remains,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  Losses in futures were limited after data showed U.S. car
sales expanded more than analysts estimated last month,
improving the outlook for demand of the commodity used in tires.
Car and light truck sales rose 17 percent to 1.5 million units
in August, the most since May 2007, according to researcher
Autodata Corp.  Thai rubber free-on-board added 0.6 percent to 86.40 baht
($2.68) a kilogram yesterday, according to data from the Rubber
Research Institute of  Thailand . The contract for January
delivery lost 0.5 percent to 20,590  yuan  ($3,364) a ton on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
