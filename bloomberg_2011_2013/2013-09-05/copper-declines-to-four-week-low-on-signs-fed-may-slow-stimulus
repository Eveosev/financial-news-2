Copper futures slumped to a four-week low as signs of an improving U.S. economy increased
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will start slowing stimulus.  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index last month climbed at the fastest pace since at least
January 2008, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The Fed
will probably decide to lower its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases this month, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg Aug. 9-13.  “Tapering is a big concern for  emerging markets  in
particular,”  Bart Melek , the head of commodity strategy at TD
Securities in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. “That’s a
big source of demand for copper.”  Copper futures for delivery in December dropped 0.3 percent
to $3.2315 a pound by 11:41 a.m. on the Comex in New York, after
falling to $3.22, the lowest for a most-active contract since
Aug. 8.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months declined 0.3 percent to $7,104.75 a metric ton ($3.22 a
pound).  To contact the reporter on this story:
