A cross-party panel of lawmakers
urged U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  to pause and revise
legislation to introduce a register of lobbyists.  The bill as drafted would miss “the vast majority” of
lobbyists, Parliament’s Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee said in a report published today. The government
should withdraw it and submit it to a special committee for
redrafting, the panel said.  “‘This bill is an object lesson in how not to produce
legislation,” the committee chairman, opposition Labour
lawmaker Graham Allen, said in an e-mailed statement. “None of
the measures will address the scandals that caused comment by
the prime minister, the coalition parties and above all the
public.”  The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning, and
Trade Union Administration Bill was attacked on Sept. 3 as
inadequate by lawmakers from Cameron’s  Conservative Party , and
as a restriction on free speech from his Labour Party opponents.  Cameron announced the measure in June after a series of
news reports alleged lawmakers were offering parliamentary
services in return for cash. It tied the compulsory registration
of some lobbyists to restrictions on the political activities of
labor unions.  The bill sets a 390,000-pound ($609,000) cap on the amount
any organization that isn’t a political party can spend during
an election. This would restrict trades-union campaigns in
support of Labour. Charities have questioned whether it would
catch them too. Meanwhile, it doesn’t cover in-house lobbyists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
