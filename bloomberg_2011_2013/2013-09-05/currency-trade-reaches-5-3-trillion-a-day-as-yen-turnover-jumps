Foreign-exchange trading surged to
an average $5.3 trillion a day in April 2013, boosted by greater
yen volumes, the  Bank for International Settlements  said.  Trading increased 33 percent since the same period in 2010,
the BIS said, citing a survey of currency traders it runs every
three years. That’s an acceleration from a 20 percent increase
in the three years through 2010. The yen had the biggest jump in
trading activity among major currencies, while the euro’s role
as the second-most traded currency was reduced. Emerging-market
currencies increased their share, with the Mexican peso entering
the top 10 most-actively traded currencies.  Volumes in the global foreign-exchange market are
increasing as traders expand activities in developing nations
and banks focus on the  currency markets  while stricter
regulations after the financial crisis threaten earnings from
other divisions. Transactions jumped this year as diverging
economies stoked increasing swings in exchange rates.  “Post the financial crisis in 2008, foreign exchange has
been a very interesting asset class for banks and investors to
focus on because of the liquidity and diversity,” said Vincent Craignou, the London-based global head of foreign exchange and
precious metals derivatives at HSBC Holdings Plc. “It has also
become extremely competitive because a lot of banks have been
keen to grow market share.”  Dollar Grip  The euro slipped 0.7 percent to $1.3116 as of 2:02 p.m. New
York time, after reaching the weakest level since July 19. The
dollar strengthened 0.4 percent at 100.11 yen after climbing to
the most since July 25. The euro depreciated 0.3 percent to
131.31 yen.  The  U.S. dollar  increased its lead as the most-traded
currency in the three years through April, the BIS said. It was
on one side of 87 percent of all trades, an increase of 2
percentage points since the previous survey.  Yen trading surged 63 percent between 2010 and 2013,
according to the BIS report, with the most notable increase in
activity occurring between October 2012 and April 2013. That
period preceded the announcement from the  Bank of Japan  on April
4 that it would buy an unprecedented 7 trillion yen ($71
billion) of bonds a month in an attempt to achieve a 2 percent
inflation goal within two years. The yen slid more than 15
percent versus the dollar from the end of September 2012 through
end March, and tumbled to the lowest versus the dollar since
October 2008 in May of this year.  Euro Slump  The increases in trading is boosting bank earnings. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., based in  New York , said in July that its
currency-trading operation had “significantly higher” revenue
in the second quarter than in the year-earlier period. Credit
Suisse Group AG,  Switzerland ’s second-biggest lender, said July
25 that increased currency volatility helped boost second-quarter earnings.  The euro’s share of the foreign-exchange market slumped to
33 percent, the smallest share since the introduction of the 17-nation common currency, from 39 percent in April 2010, the
Basel, Switzerland-based BIS said today.  The decline followed the euro-area’s debt crisis, which
left the region’s economy in a record-long recession and pushed
the bond yields of Spain and  Italy  to the highest since the
common currency was introduced in 1999.  Greece, Ireland and  Portugal  all entered financial-assistance programs since the previous BIS survey. The  European
Central Bank  introduced unlimited three-year loans under its
Longer-Term Refinancing Operation to ease a banking crisis, as
well as promising to buy the bonds of highly-indebted nations
that requested assistance.  Chinese Yuan  The BIS was formed in 1930 and acts as a central bank for
the world’s monetary authorities. Its Central Bank Survey of
Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity is based on
data from 53 jurisdictions.  The role of the Chinese  yuan  in foreign-exchange trading
“surged in line with efforts to internationalize the Chinese
currency,” the BIS said. Turnover in the Chinese currency
jumped to $120 billion a day from $34 billion a day in April
2010 as it became the ninth most-actively traded currency with a
2.2 percent share of global volumes.  Trading became increasingly concentrated within the world’s
major financial centers during the survey period, the BIS report
showed. The U.K., U.S.,  Singapore  and  Japan  accounted for 71
percent of foreign-exchange trading, up from a combined share of
66 percent through April 2010. The U.K. increased its role as
the largest center of foreign-exchange activity, with 41 percent
of global turnover, compared with 37 percent in 2010. Singapore
overtook Japan to become the world’s third-largest trading
center.  Hedge Funds  Other financial institutions, which include  hedge funds ,
institutional investors and other non-dealers, added the most
growth to foreign-exchange trading, the survey said. Regional
and smaller banks that are the clients of dealers accounted for
about 24 percent of global currency turnover. Proprietary
trading firms, hedge funds and institutional investors each made
up about 11 percent of trading. Sovereign-wealth funds and
central banks accounted for less than 1 percent, the BIS said.  Interdealer trading increased 34 percent to $2.1 trillion a
day in 2013, compared with $1.5 trillion a day three years
earlier, a share that was “roughly constant,” the BIS said.
Trading by non-financial customers, which includes governments
and corporation, with dealers fell to $465 billion a day this
year from $532 billion a day in 2010.  Currency Swaps  Spot foreign-exchange trading grew 38 percent to $2
trillion each day, which was about 40 percent of the increase in
global currency activity between this year and 2010, the BIS
said. That segment of the market expanded 48 percent in 2010
from three years earlier.  Foreign-exchange swaps grew 27 percent in 2013, with daily
volume of $2.2 trillion, or 42 percent of all currency
transactions. Swaps accounted for 44 percent of transactions in
2010, the survey said. Trading in currency forwards and options
increased “more strongly,” the BIS said. Options trading grew
60 percent as the two segments taken together accounted for
almost 25 percent of global currency-trading growth since 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
