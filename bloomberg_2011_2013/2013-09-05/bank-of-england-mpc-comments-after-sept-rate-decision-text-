The following is the text of the
 Bank of England  Monetary Policy Committee comments following
the September rate decision:  The  Bank of England â€™s Monetary Policy Committee at its meeting
on 4 September voted to maintain the official  Bank Rate  paid on
commercial bank reserves at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted to
maintain the stock of asset purchases financed by the issuance
of central bank reserves at Stg 375 billion.  The Committee reached its decisions in the context of the
monetary policy forward guidance announced alongside the
publication of the August 2013 Inflation Report.  Also in the context of that guidance, the Committee agreed to
reinvest the Stg 1.9 billion of cash flows associated with the
redemption of the September 2013 gilt held in the Asset Purchase
Facility.  The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30am on
Wednesday 18 September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
