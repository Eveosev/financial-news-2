The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
operator of the only oil-export link in  Russia  that has shared
foreign ownership, will cut daily September crude exports from
the  Black Sea  to the lowest in six months, a final loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  CPC will ship 2.57 million metric tons this month, compared
with 2.87 million tons in August, according to the schedule.
That’s equal to 664,724 barrels a day, the least since March and
down 7.6 percent from last month.  The program comprises six cargoes of 134,000 to 135,500
tons each and 20 consignments of 85,000 to 93,500 tons,
according to the document.  The volume in the final program is more than the 2.35
million tons, or 607,744 barrels a day, scheduled in the
preliminary plan released on Aug. 12.  The CPC pipeline, in which  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from Kazakhstan’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s
Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Russia owns 31 percent of
the pipeline and Kazakhstan 21 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO
Lukoil and a joint venture between OAO Rosneft and  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  are among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
