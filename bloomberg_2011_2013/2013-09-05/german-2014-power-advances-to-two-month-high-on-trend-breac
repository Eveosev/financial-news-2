German power for delivery next year
advanced to a two-month high today after breaking through
technical resistance.  Electricity for delivery in 2014 in  Germany ,  Europe ’s
biggest energy market, gained as much 1.5 percent to 38.40 euros
a megawatt-hour, the highest since July 3, according to broker
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract traded at 38.25 euros
at 1:31 p.m. Berlin time. The resistance level was at 36.90
euros, according to Thomas Randel, a trader at  EnBW Energie
Baden-Wuerttemberg AG. (EBK)   “German power is rising after breaking a trend,”
Karlsruhe, Germany, based Randel said in an e-mail today. “The
contract has now room to rise to 40 euros.”  A slump in electricity demand, and increasing output from
solar and wind, helped push the 2014 German power contract down
to a record 36.05 euros a megawatt-hour Aug. 6. The contract, a
European benchmark, lost 22 percent over the past 12 months.  German power traded through brokers slumped 31 percent in
August from a year earlier, according to a report today by the
London Energy Brokers Association. German power demand declined
1.3 percent in the first half of this year, energy lobby group
BDEW said last month.  French electricity for 2014 climbed 0.6 percent to 42.50
euros a megawatt-hour, the most since July 3, according to
broker data on Bloomberg. The contract dropped to a record 41.35
euros a megawatt-hour June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
