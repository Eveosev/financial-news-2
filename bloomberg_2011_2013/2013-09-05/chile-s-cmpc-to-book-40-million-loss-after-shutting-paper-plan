Empresas CMPC SA (CMPC) ,  Chile ’s second-largest forestry company, plans to close a newspaper mill in the
country’s south because of rising power prices and said it will
book a $40 million loss.  Shutting the Rio Vergara plant comes as its electricity
contract is due to expire, which would lead to an increase in
costs, the Santiago-based company said in a filing to Chile’s
securities regulator today.  CMPC, owned by Chile’s billionaire Matte family, is
shedding its worst performing unit as the company ramps up pulp
processing in  Brazil  to meet rising demand from  Asia . CMPC
shares  rose  1.7 percent to 1,500 pesos at 3:17 p.m. in Santiago,
reducing a year-to-date decline to 13 percent.  “We did not want to close the mill, and have searched for
options to keep Papeles Rio Vergara in operation,” Chief
Executive Officer Hernan Rodriguez said in the statement.
“Unfortunately, the economic reality of higher electricity
prices made this impossible.”  The plant will continue to operate until Nov. 30. CMPC will
offer a retirement program to the plant’s 202 workers and offer
them jobs at the company’s other units, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
