France cut its outlook for wine
production for a second time in two months after hail damaged
vineyards in the Bordeaux region and cold and humidity hurt
pollination, leading to fruit losses.  Output may climb 7.5 percent to 44.5 million hectoliters
(1.17 billion gallons) from 41.4 million hectoliters in 2012,
the  Agriculture Ministry  wrote in a  report  today. The forecast
was cut by 1.3 million hectoliters from a month ago, equivalent
to 174 million bottles.  Hailstorms in the Bordeaux region at the start of August
damaged vines in the Libournais area, which includes Pomerol and
Saint-Emilion, as well as the Entre-Deux-Mers area, the ministry
said. That caused losses estimated at about 600,000 hectoliters,
equal to 78 million bottles.  “Many violent storms damaged vines on vast areas,
especially in the Centre region, in Burgundy and above all in
the Bordeaux region,” the ministry wrote.  Vines across the country suffered from failed grape
development due to unpollinated flowers, called  coulure  by
growers and caused by either unusually cold and humid conditions
or excessive warmth.  France ’s average temperature in June was
0.7 degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) lower than normal,
with excess rain in the southwest region that includes Bordeaux.  The ministry had forecast last month the volume of the 2013
vintage would be 45.8 million hectoliters, already down from an
initial outlook in July of 46.6 million hectoliters.  Drought, Frost  Last year’s wine production was the country’s lowest in
four decades after grapes suffered from drought, humidity,
frost, disease and hail, with final output more than 10 percent
below an initial forecast. The outlook has been lowered by 4.7
percent so far this year, equating to 292 million bottles.  France’s wine and champagne exports were valued at 7.84
billion euros ($10.3 billion) in 2012, accounting for 14 percent
of the country’s farm and food shipments, trade  data  show.  Output in the Bordeaux region, typically France’s biggest
producer of designated-origin wines, may fall 19 percent to 4.43
million hectoliters from 5.45 million hectoliters in 2012, the
ministry forecast. Grape picking has been delayed by at least 15
days after a cold spring.  Burgundy  and neighboring Beaujolais are suffering from
small grapes, and the harvest will be the latest in 30 years,
the ministry said. Combined output for the two regions is
predicted to rise 21 percent to 2.18 million hectoliters, down
from an August forecast of 25 percent.  Vineyard Conditions  In the  Champagne  region, production is forecast to jump 51
percent to 2.99 million hectoliters, with vineyards in good
condition for now, the ministry said. Production slumped 35
percent last year.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, based in Paris, is the
world’s largest maker of champagne, with  brands  including Moet &
Chandon and  Dom Perignon .  Vranken-Pommery Monopole SA (VRAP)  ranks
second, followed by Pernod-Ricard SA and Laurent-Perrier.  In Languedoc-Roussillon, France’s biggest wine region by
total volume, production is forecast to rise 10 percent to 13.2
million hectoliters, 1 percentage point less than expected in
August. Output in the Loire valley may jump 41 percent to 2.79
million hectoliters, the ministry said.  Production in Alsace, known for its Riesling wines, is
predicted to slide 11 percent to 1.04 million hectoliters after
a cold spring resulted in fewer grapes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
