Mortgage rates in the U.S. climbed
close to a two-year high, increasing borrowing costs as the
housing recovery cools.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage increased to
4.57 percent this week from 4.51 percent, Freddie Mac said in a
statement today. The average 15-year rate rose to 3.59 percent
from 3.54 percent, according to the McLean, Virginia-based
company.  A jump in the 30-year rate from a near-record low of 3.35
percent in May has cut into affordability and pushed some would-be homebuyers out of the market. Applications for home-purchase
loans plunged 15 percent in the past four months, according to
data from the Mortgage Bankers Association released yesterday.
 Contracts (USPHTMOM)  to buy existing houses and  new-home sales  both
declined in July.  “Higher rates do push buyers to the sidelines,” said
Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a Riverdale, New
Jersey-based mortgage-data firm. “Some borrowers will step out,
some borrowers will change their choices and look for less-costly homes.”  In a survey released yesterday by Redfin, a Seattle-based
brokerage, 63 percent of potential buyers said higher mortgage
rates are making it harder for them to afford a home. While low
 inventory  was the most common concern for buyers, rising
borrowing costs was the second-biggest, according to the poll of
1,722 people shopping for homes, conducted from Aug. 23-26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
