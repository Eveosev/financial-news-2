Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL) ’s
Mariner West natural gas liquids pipeline will have an initial
capacity of about 20,000 barrels a day, the company said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Jeff Shields, a Sunoco spokesman in Philadelphia, is
correcting a Sept. 3 statement indicating the line would start
at 10,000 barrels a day, Shields said. Capacity will increase to
about 50,000 barrels a day by the end of the first quarter of
2014, he said.  The project will transport ethane from the Marcellus shale
formation in western  Pennsylvania  to the Sarnia petrochemical
market in southwestern Ontario. Mariner West will begin
operations in late September or early October, Shields said
Sept. 3.  Gas liquids  prices have declined since 2012 amid ample
supplies from shale formations, prompting processors to leave
ethane mixed in the gas stream rather than separate it,
according to the Energy Department’s Energy Information
Administration.  Natural gas output may rise 1 percent from a year ago to a
record 69.89 billion cubic feet a day this year, the EIA said in
its Short-Term Energy Outlook on Aug. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
