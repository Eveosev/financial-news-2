Federal Reserve Bank of  Dallas 
President Richard Fisher, who has opposed additional stimulus
and votes on policy next year, said the Fed must ensure its bond
buying program doesn’t disrupt financial markets.  “We have to make sure that the actions we take are taking
into consideration financial stability,” Fisher said today in
Dallas. “This is one of the arguments we had: If we go down
this path, what will the cost be?”  Fisher spoke after the yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note climbed to a two-year high of  2.98 percent  partly
on speculation policy makers will decide to begin tapering $85
billion in monthly bond purchases at a Sept. 17-18 meeting.  The key question with asset purchases -- which have pushed
up the Fed’s balance sheet to  $3.64 trillion  -- “is preserving
financial stability,” Fisher said in response to an audience
question after a speech to the Dallas Estate Planning Council.
He said he “lost the argument” last year on whether to push on
with record easing.  “Now the question is, how do we put it to an end?” he
said. “This doesn’t go on forever.”  The Fed has pledged for more than a year to press on with
asset purchases until achieving sustainable gains in the labor
market. The central bank announced a third round of quantitative
easing in September 2012 to reduce longer-term interest rates,
stoke economic growth and combat unemployment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
