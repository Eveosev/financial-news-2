Mexico ’s peso fell to its weakest
level in a year as speculation mounted the  Federal Reserve  this
month will begin to reduce record monetary stimulus that’s
fueled flows into the Latin American country’s debt.  The peso depreciated 0.6 percent to 13.3904 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:39 a.m. in Mexico City, the weakest level on a closing
basis since July 2012. Yields on peso bonds maturing in 2024
increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.54
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s peso securities have been retreating with the rest
of  emerging markets  amid concern an improving U.S. economy will
prompt the Fed to reduce its $85 billion monthly bond purchase
program. U.S. Labor Department data showed today that jobless
claims declined by more than forecast last week. Mexico sends
about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  “Right now it’s all about what the Fed is doing,”  Eduardo Suarez , Latin America currency strategist at Bank of Nova
Scotia, said in a phone interview from Toronto.  Fed officials, set to meet Sept. 17-18, are watching the
job market along with other economic data to evaluate the pace
of asset purchases. The U.S. central bank will reduce its
monthly purchases at its meeting this month, according to 65
percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
