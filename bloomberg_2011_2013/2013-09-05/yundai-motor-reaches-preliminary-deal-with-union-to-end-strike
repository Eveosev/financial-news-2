Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  reached a
preliminary agreement with its South Korean union to raise
wages, paving the way for the end of a strike that’s resulted in
an estimated 1 trillion won ($910 million) in lost output.  Under the agreement, which is subject to a vote by the
Korean carmaker’s 46,000 union members on Sept. 9, the company
will raise the average base salary by 5.1 percent, Seoul-based
Hyundai Motor said in a statement yesterday. The automaker also
agreed to pay a one-time bonus equivalent to 3 1/2 months of
wages plus 5 million won, it said.  Workers have staged partial walkouts since Aug. 20, causing
what Hyundai Motor estimates to be more than 50,000 vehicles in
lost production. South Korea’s largest automaker, which has seen
profit fall for three straight quarters, is grappling with
increased competition as a weaker yen gives Japanese carmakers
an edge in the U.S.  Hyundai Motor rose 2.3 percent to 249,500 won at 11:13 a.m.
in Seoul trading. The benchmark Kospi index increased 0.2
percent.  The union refused extra work for 13 weekends beginning
March 9, demanding higher compensation on those shifts. The
stoppage, although not a legally sanctioned strike, cost Hyundai
1.7 trillion won in lost production, according to the company’s
estimates.  Hyundai estimates that labor disputes have caused missed
production of more than 1.2 million vehicles and lost sales
worth 13.3 trillion won before this year. Workers have gone on
strike in 23 of 27 years since the union’s 1987 formation.  The automaker has sought to reduce the impact of strikes in
South Korea by expanding production in the U.S.,  China ,  India 
and  Turkey  during the last decade.  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , an affiliate of Hyundai, is still
negotiating this year’s wage pact with its union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
