David Ortiz hit two home runs as
seven different Red Sox players recorded homers in  Boston ’s 20-4
rout of the Detroit Tigers.  The Red Sox (84-57) lead the American League East, eight
games ahead of the third-place  New York  Yankees (75-64), who
beat the Chicago White Sox 6-5 last night.  The Yankees begin a four-game Major League Baseball series
tonight against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. The teams are
also scheduled to meet at Fenway Park in Boston for three games
from Sept. 13-15.  Stephen Drew hit a two-run homer in the second inning,
Jacoby Ellsbury added one in the third and Ortiz, who drove in
four runs, blasted his first home run in the fourth last night
to tie the game 4-4 at Fenway Park.  Will Middlebrooks recorded a grand slam in the eight-run
sixth inning, while Daniel Nava recorded a two-run homer. Ryan Lavarnway and Ortiz each hit home runs in the seventh and Mike Napoli had a solo home run in the eighth.  “I’ve never really seen that many happy faces in the
dugout at the same time,” said Ortiz, who earned his 2,000th
hit during the game. “It was like lighting a firework. It’s
like the fireworks just keep on coming.”  Boston pulled away in an eight-run sixth inning when Will  Prince Fielder had a two-run homer off starter Ryan Dempster in the third to give the Tigers a 3-2 lead.  Dempster (8-9) allowed four runs on six hits and struck out
seven in six innings for the Red Sox.  Rick Porcello (11-8) gave up nine runs, including three
homers, on seven hits in five innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
