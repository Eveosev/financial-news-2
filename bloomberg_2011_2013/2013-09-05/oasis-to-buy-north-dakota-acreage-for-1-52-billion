Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS) , the Houston-based oil producer founded in 2007, signed four separate
agreements totaling $1.52 billion to add to its  North Dakota 
acreage and boost output.  The acquisitions encompass about 161,000 net acres,
expanding the company’s holdings by 49 percent to 492,000 acres,
Oasis said in a statement today. Oasis didn’t identify the
sellers and said it expects the deals to close in early October.  “These acquisitions add high quality acreage in the heart
of the Bakken and Three Forks play, providing incremental scale
to our premier position in the Williston Basin,” Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Thomas B. Nusz said in the statement.
“As we enter full development mode, our size and scale will
continue to drive growth, efficiencies and  shareholder value .”  North Dakota’s oil output has more than doubled in the past
three years as producers tap shale formations. The acquisitions
would make Oasis the state’s seventh-largest acreage holder,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  Oasis will increase the number of rigs drilling on the
combined acreage to as many as 16 by the end of next year, from
13 today.  The company paid a “very reasonable” price,  Scott Hanold ,
an RBC Capital Markets LLC analyst based in  Minneapolis , wrote
today in a note to clients. The company probably will sell
shares to finance part of the purchase, he wrote.  Oasis’ revolving credit facility was boosted to $1.5
billion from $1.25 billion based on its reserves, as four
lenders joined the bank group, the company said.  Oasis fell 2.7 percent to $38.54 at 9:50 a.m. in New York.
The shares have gained 21 percent this year. The company was
formed six years ago by Nusz and Chief Operating Officer Taylor
Reid, with funding from private-equity firm EnCap Investments
LP.  (Oasis will hold a conference call on the transactions  at
10 a.m.  New York  time accessible at +1-877-621-0256 or
+1-706-634-0151, passcode 54145452.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
