Defending champion  Andy Murray  was
knocked out of the U.S. Open quarterfinals in straight sets
today by Stanislas Wawrinka.  The ninth-seeded Wawrinka, 28, of  Switzerland , did not face
a break point in the match as he defeated the third-seeded
Murray 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 on a windy Arthur Ashe Stadium court at the
National Tennis Center in New York.  Murray, 26, from the U.K., had reached the final in
his previous four Grand Slam tournaments. Wawrinka advanced to
his first semifinal at one of tennisâ€™ four annual major events.  Wawrinka had 45 winners in the match, while Murray had 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
