UBS AG (UBSN)  Chairman  Axel Weber  said
banks need to reassess their business models in response to
tougher regulation of the financial industry.  Banks need to be “simpler and less capital-intensive,”
Weber said today at the Policy Exchange, a London-based research
group. UBS, the biggest Swiss bank, has overhauled its
businesses to be more “risk-averse,” he said.  The European Union is set to phase in its version of the
Basel III regulations starting in January, and they will fully
apply as of 2019. The rules, from the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, require banks to hold capital equal to at least 7
percent of their risk-weighted assets, while also meeting
indebtedness limits and liquidity requirements.  Weber, 56, who was president of  Germany ’s Bundesbank before
joining Zurich-based UBS in 2012, also said it’s better to have
a single supervisor for banks in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
