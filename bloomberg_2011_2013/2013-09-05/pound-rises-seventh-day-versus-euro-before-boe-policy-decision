The pound gained for a seventh day
versus the euro, approaching the strongest level in more than
three months, before Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee
announces its latest policy decision.  Sterling was little changed against the dollar. The central
bank’s nine-member MPC will maintain its asset-purchase  target 
at 375 billion pounds ($585 billion), according to a Bloomberg
News survey of 38 economists before the announcement at noon
London time. Policy makers will leave the benchmark  interest
rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent, a separate survey shows.  The pound climbed 0.2 percent to 84.40 pence per euro at
7:16 a.m. London time after reaching 84.27 pence yesterday, the
strongest level since May 16. Sterling traded at $1.5606.  Under the Bank of England’s forward guidance, the MPC plans
to keep its key  interest rate  on hold as long as unemployment
exceeds 7 percent. The jobless rate was at 7.8 percent,
according to data released on Aug. 14.  The pound strengthened 6.5 percent over the past six
months, the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 4 percent and the dollar climbed 2.9 percent.  U.K. government bonds lost 4.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
securities dropped 2.6 percent and Treasuries declined 3.8
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
