Inversiones Alsacia SA’s dollar
bonds gained the most in two months as JPMorgan Chase & Co.
raised its recommendation on the debt to the equivalent of hold,
citing the bus company’s new contract terms.  The yield on the bonds due in 2018 fell 1.46 percentage
point to 21.54 percent at 1:44 p.m. in Santiago, the biggest
decline on a closing basis since June 17, according to Trace,
the bond pricing system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Alsacia, which has asked bondholders for waivers of
violations of its debt agreements, said on Aug. 29 that the
government approved a 4 percent increase per passenger on its
bus routes in Santiago. The company controls two of seven
operators in the capital city’s  Transantiago  public transport
system.  While the increased passenger payments will not have a
significant impact on the company’s liquidity, they are
“positive for the story,” JPMorgan analyst Daniel Sensel wrote
in a research note. A meeting scheduled this week with debt
holders also “could be a reflection of the company’s
willingness to negotiate better terms with bondholders including
a shorter term for the waivers and more transparency in terms of
the outlook for the company,” Sensel wrote.  Alsacia said Aug. 5 that its ratio of  cash flow  to total
debt including interest fell below a level that would obligate
it to prepay the 2018 bonds. The yield on the debt surged to a
record high on Aug. 29.  Lower demand for bus transportation and persistent fare
cheating led to the violation of the debt agreements, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
