France  paid the most to borrow for
10 years since President Francois Hollande was elected, on
prospects the economic recovery that began in the second quarter
will strengthen further.  The treasury sold 4.24 billion euros ($5.59 billion) of
2023 debt at an average yield of 2.57 percent, the highest at
any auction since May 2012. It also sold 2.49 billion euros in
2021 securities at an average yield of 2.17 percent -- more than
1.42 percent on May 2 -- and 1.66 billion euros 2045 debt at 3.6
percent.  The higher yields reflect expectations growth is picking up
in the euro area after the region exited its longest recession
in the second quarter. Euro-area services and factory output
expanded for a second month in August, according data published
yesterday by  Markit Economics . The composite purchasing managers
index rose to 51.7, its highest since June 11.  The data suggests that “the euro-zone economy has
continued to expand in the third quarter,” said  Jonathan Loynes , chief economist at Capital Economics in  London .  France auctioned 10-year bonds at a yield of 1.81 percent
on May 2 this year, a record low.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will discuss
his outlook for the European economy and rates starting at 1:30
p.m. in  Frankfurt  today.  French 10-year bonds yielded 2.58 percent as of 11.20 a.m.
in Paris. The spread with comparable German debt was 59.6 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
