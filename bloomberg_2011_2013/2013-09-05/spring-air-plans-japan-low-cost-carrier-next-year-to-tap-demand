Spring Airlines Co.,  China ’s biggest
non-government controlled carrier, applied to offer domestic
services from  Tokyo ’s Narita airport to serve growing demand for
low-cost flights in Asia’s second-biggest economy.  Spring Airlines  Japan  Co. plans to fly Boeing Co. 737
aircraft on three routes in Japan starting in May 2014, the
company said today in a statement. Shanghai-based Spring Air
will own 33 percent of the venture with Japanese investors
holding the remainder.  Spring operates flights from China to Japan’s Ibaraki
prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, and intends to add to low-cost
carrier competition in Japan, where three budget carriers
started services last year. Spring would be competing with  ANA
Holdings Inc. (9202) ’s Vanilla Air, which starts operations before the
end of this year at Narita after the Japanese legacy carrier
bought out  AirAsia (AIRA)  Bhd.’s share of a low-cost carrier venture.  “We will work to cut unnecessary costs to offer low
fares,” Hiroshi Ugai, president of Spring Japan, told reporters
in Tokyo today. He declined to say how much tickets would cost.  AirAsia, the region’s biggest discount carrier, announced
in June that it was exiting the ANA partnership amid disputes
over operating the company.  ANA also holds a 39 percent stake in budget airline Peach
Aviation, which began operations last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
