Catalan President Artur Mas said he
won’t defy  Spain ’s national leader Mariano Rajoy by holding a
referendum on independence for his region if the government
rules it illegal.  “If there is no other way to do this consultation, we’ll
call elections which I want to hold in 2016,” Mas said in an
interview with Catalunya Radio today.  Mas’s retreat will strain the governing coalition in
Catalonia, Spain’s biggest regional economy, which was forged in
December on a pledge to hold an independence referendum next
year. Rajoy has told Mas such a move would be illegal.  “We have to decide our future in 2014,” Mas’s coalition
partner Oriol Junqueras, leader of the Catalan Republican Left,
said in a post on Twitter today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
