Tin rose in  London , heading for the
highest close in more than four months, amid concern supply will
be limited as Indonesian producers restrict exports.  Smelters in  Indonesia , the world’s largest tin shipper,
stopped deliveries this month as the Jakarta Futures Exchange
awaited approval to trade tin contracts. A rule requiring ingots
to be traded locally before export hampered transactions with
customers. PT Timah, the third-biggest tin producer, declared
force majeure on deliveries since Aug. 30.  “People are worried about where the tin supply is going to
come from,” Gayle Berry, an analyst at Barclays Plc in London,
said by phone today. “The Indonesian situation has a potential
to seriously tighten the market.”  Tin for delivery in three months rose 1.7 percent to
$22,250 a metric ton by 10:50 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
A close at that level would be the highest since April 11.
Prices climbed above the 200-day moving average at about
$22,042, an indication to analysts who study technical charts of
potential further gains.  Tin for immediate delivery settled yesterday at a $125-a-ton premium to the contract for delivery in three months, the
largest backwardation since Aug. 17, 2010, and a signal of
limited supply. Demand will exceed production by 3,000 tons next
year, a fifth straight deficit, according to BNP Paribas SA.  Copper for delivery in three months rose 0.2 percent to
$7,135 a ton on the LME. The metal for delivery in December
gained 0.1 percent to $3.2455 a pound on the Comex in New York.  A government report tomorrow will show employers in the
U.S., the world’s second-biggest copper consumer after  China ,
hired more workers last month than in July, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Copper stockpiles tracked by the LME fell 0.1 percent to
603,275 tons, daily exchange data showed. Orders to remove the
metal from warehouses declined 0.1 percent to 288,675 tons.  Aluminum and zinc rose in London. Nickel and lead slid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
