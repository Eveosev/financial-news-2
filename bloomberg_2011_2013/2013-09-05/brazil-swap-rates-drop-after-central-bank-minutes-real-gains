Brazil ’s shorter-term swap rates
declined to a one-week low after the central bank refrained from
signaling that it will step up the pace of increases in
borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 dropped four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 10.49 percent at
10:02 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real appreciated 0.5 percent to
2.3477 per U.S. dollar, erasing an earlier loss.  The central bank said in minutes of its August meeting
published today that it’s appropriate to proceed with increases
of a half-percentage point to ensure that inflation spurred by a
weakening real won’t hurt demand and investments.  “The minutes were neutral,” Luis Otavio de Souza Leal,
the chief economist at Banco ABC Brasil SA in Sao Paulo, said in
a telephone interview. “They don’t bring any signal that the
central bank will quicken or slow the pace of rate increases.”  Policy makers voted unanimously last week to raise the
target lending rate to 9 percent from 8.50 percent, marking the
third straight increase of 50 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
