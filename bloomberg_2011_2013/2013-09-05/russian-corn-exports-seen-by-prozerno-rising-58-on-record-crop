Russia  will boost corn exports in
the season that began July 1 as it reaps a record harvest after
dry weather in early summer and showers in July and August
helped crops, according to OOO ProZerno.  Corn shipments will rise to 3 million metric tons in
2013-14 from 1.9 million tons a season earlier, said Vladimir Petrichenko, director general of the Moscow-based agricultural
consultancy, at a grain conference in Russia’s capital today.
That would be an all-time high, according to U.S. Department of
Agriculture data.  Petrichenko raised his estimate for the corn harvest to 9.8
million to 10 million tons, from a forecast of at least 9.7
million tons last month. The global harvest may climb to 938
million tons in 2013-14, from 875 million tons, according to an
estimate by the Agricultural Market Information System.  Expectations for record global output helped send corn
prices 34 percent lower this year, making the grain the worst
performing commodity in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
raw materials. Corn for December delivery dropped 2.3 percent to
$4.585 a bushel at 10:21 a.m. in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
