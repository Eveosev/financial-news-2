Euro-area policy makers are set to
support Greece until it regains full  market access  as they
prepare more aid to follow a pair of bailouts, said Dutch
Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem.  “It’s realistic to assume that additional support will be
needed,” Dijsselbloem, who heads the group of euro finance
chiefs, told lawmakers in Brussels today. “In this context, the
eurogroup has indicated clearly that it is committed to
providing adequate support to Greece during the current program
and beyond until it has regained market access.”  The so-called troika that oversees Greece’s bailout is
planning to return to  Athens  in the coming weeks to assess the
progress of Greece’s 240 billion-euro ($317 billion) rescue.  “We stand ready to do more on the condition that  Greece 
complies to all the conditions of the program,” Dijsselbloem
said today. “We will evaluate where we stand in the program,
also in terms of debt sustainability, in April next year.” He
said it was too soon to discuss specifics.  To contact the reporters on this story:
