Enrique Peña Nieto isn't just good looks. The young President of Mexico is taking on hunger, poverty, and corruption in his country—and using tourism to help on all fronts. That's why we  named him one of this year's Visionaries , a group of eight remarkable global citizens who are using their celebrity and power to improve conditions around the world. Why is the crusade against hunger your most important priority instead of security?  My government has set many goals; not just one. One is to create a peaceful and tranquil Mexico. Another is to make an all-inclusive Mexico: to eliminate the poverty and inequality, to ensure better quality education, and to create sustainable economic growth. One is to make Mexico a responsible global actor. We launched a national crusade against hunger focused on the 400 poorest communities. If we want to provide equality and growth for the entire country, we have to pay attention to those who suffer from hunger. This does not only mean providing them with something to eat, but also changing their surroundings so that they can experience development. We are already taking the first steps in bringing them schools, building roads and highways in order to bring them communication. We are founding health clinics, creating social programs, and productive projects in order to create jobs. You have talked about the incredible economic disparities in Mexico. Was there a point in your life where you said, "Enough! This is just not acceptable, we have to do something?  Politics can transform society and improve social conditions of the nation. I think it is fundamental to understand that the ethics of politics indicate that you should concentrate your efforts on those marginalized people who live in poverty with few opportunities to develop individually. You're taking on the vested interests of so-called old Mexico. And yet you have been able to make opposing parties work together. How has this been possible?  Mexico is a diverse and pluralistic country, and we have to demonstrate that democracy has the capacity to deliver results. In our differences, we were not making it possible for Mexico to become more productive and economically sustainable. So we have now proposed to include all visions of the political forces that want Mexico to have more credit, more competition, and reforms. . How will tourism play a role in your effort to fight poverty?  Tourism is a promoter of regional development, a generator of employment, and without a doubt, a projection of our country in the world. We propose to diversify our tourism offerings to include cultural, sports, and high-end tourism, and to improve conditions in existing destinations. For example, we have to revive traditional Acapulco. Lots of foreigners think that Acapulco has been destroyed.  That's unfortunate. I love to go to Acapulco with my family. In recent months, Acapulco has attracted large numbers of visitors, and more foreign establishments. At the end of the year, in Holy Week and in summertime, Acapulco is always packed. We have to revive the traditional part, which is now very deteriorated. We have to celebrate the unique beauty that Acapulco Bay has. Many Americans are afraid to visit. Is Mexico safe?  Security is a major priority and we have concentrated on reducing violence, because violence unfortunately swung out of control due to criminal gangs, disputes over land, and drug selling. If our strategy does not lead to a reduction of violence within a reasonable time, then it will lose social support. Unfortunately, events in some parts of the country have damaged the image of Mexico as a whole. This has inhibited more visitors from coming. I can confirm that there are places that are very safe and others that are unfortunately unsafe. Some local communities have started opposing big box resorts like those of Cancun. Is the government interested in smaller scale tourism development?  In tourism we must provide better surroundings for both visitors and those who live and work in destinations.  And that goes together with your crusade against poverty?  Exactly. For example, we are improving lives by building accommodations for workers in the Maya Riviera, being aware that it takes them a long time to get to work. This is a dynamic that we want; I believe that Mexico is rich in culture and we want to exploit this, but with absolute respect to its surroundings and natural environment, and the people. What's one thing that you wish Americans knew about Mexico?  That there is no other place as beautiful as Mexico. You have to experience Mexico, and those who have lived the experience have seen it. Mexico is a mosaic of different realities and beauties. One single visit is not enough to be able to say that you know Mexico. More From  Conde Nast Traveler :
