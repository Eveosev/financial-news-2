Crude options volatility fell when
underlying futures advanced after a report that inventories at a
key U.S. delivery hub slid to the lowest level this year.  At-the-money volatility for October options, a measure of
expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was 24.84
percent at 3:35 p.m., down from 27.8 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery rose
$1.14, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $108.37 a barrel on the
Nymex. Futures advanced as the Energy Information Administration
reported that inventories in Cushing,  Oklahoma , delivery point
for the Nymex contract fell 1.83 million barrels last week to
34.8 million, the lowest level since February 2012.  Volatility for calls protecting against a 10 percent rise
in October futures dropped to 31.42 percent from 32.85 percent.
Volatility for puts covering a 10 percent drop declined to 29.33
percent from 30.66 percent yesterday.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
November $140 calls, which rose 1 cent to 12 cents a barrel with
3,272 lots trading as of 3:43 p.m. December 2014 $110 calls were
the second-most active, rising 6 cents to $2.36 a barrel on
volume of 2,597 contracts.  Calls and puts were almost evenly split in electronic
trading at 4:34 p.m. In the previous session, calls made up 55
percent of the 91,659 lots traded.  March $85 puts were the most-active options yesterday with
4,601 contracts changing hands as they rose 2 cents to $1.60 a
barrel. November $140 calls, the next-most active, declined 1
cent to 11 cents on 4,576 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
40,597 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 37,043 lots
and December $105 calls with 34,815.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
