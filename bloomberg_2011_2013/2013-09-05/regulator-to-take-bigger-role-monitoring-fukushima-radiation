Japan ’s nuclear regulator will take
a bigger role in overseeing  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s radiation
monitoring at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant after
criticizing the utility’s reporting of its data.  The Nuclear Regulation Authority will instruct the utility,
Japan’s biggest, on how to measure radiation rates and create a
map of contaminated areas, according to a statement from the
watchdog today.  The regulator is stepping in two days after Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe presented a new policy allowing for government
intervention to deal with leaks of contaminated water at the
site 220 kilometers (137 miles) northeast of Tokyo.  Tepco, as the plant operator is known, said on Aug. 31 that
a beta-ray radiation reading of 230 millisieverts per hour had
been found on a section of pipe at a tank used to store
contaminated water.  That’s an incorrect measure to convey surface area
contamination, Shunichi Tanaka, the NRA’s chairman, said at a
meeting in  Tokyo  today.  “Tepco should have used becquerels per unit area,” he
said. “The wrongdoing led to concern that there was a lot of
contamination but basically this is just surface contamination
affecting a 20 square-centimeter area.”  The highest radiation reading around Tepco’s storage tanks
was 2,200 millisieverts per hour recorded by the company on Sept
3. Tepco has boosted its number of tank inspectors to 96,
according to a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
