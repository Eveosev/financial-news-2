Pacific Basin Shipping Ltd. (2343) , Hong
Kong’s biggest dry-bulk carrier, led a rally of shipping stocks
in the city today as it surged the most in more than four years
on higher freight rates.  The  stock  jumped 9.5 percent, the biggest gain since July
15, 2009, to close at HK$5.17 in Hong Kong trading today. The
city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index increased 1.2 percent.  The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , the benchmark freight rate for
hauling commodities, jumped 4 percent to 1,215, the highest in
21 months in  London  yesterday on higher demand for iron ore and
grains. Carriers and ship owners also slowed speeding and
scrapped more vessels to reduce excess capacity to shore up
rates, according to a Macquarie Group Ltd. note by analysts led
by Bonnie Chan yesterday.  “We believe Pacific Basin is a long-term winner in the
sector as it takes advantage of the current slump in asset
prices to acquire vessels and enhance its long-term
profitability,” Chan said in the note, rating the stock
“outperform” with a target price of HK$6.00  China Shipping Development Co Ltd. (1138) , the commodity-carrying
arm of the nation’s No.2 shipping group, advanced 6.7 percent to
close at HK$4.33 in Hong Kong trading today.  China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the nation’s biggest shipping
firm that moves containers and commodities, jumped 7 percent to
close at HK$3.86.  To contact the reporters on this story:
