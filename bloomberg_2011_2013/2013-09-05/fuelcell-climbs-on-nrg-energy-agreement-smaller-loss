FuelCell Energy Inc., (FCEL)  the biggest
publicly traded U.S. fuel-cell manufacturer, rose the most in
three months after its backlog doubled and it announced a co-marketing agreement with  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)   FuelCell rose 11 percent to $1.36 at the close in New York,
the most since June 3. The shares have gained 48 percent this
year.  NRG, the largest U.S. independent power supplier, agreed to
market fuel cells to end users including hospitals, universities
and other large electricity users, according to a statement
released after the close of regular trading yesterday.  Electricity consumers may purchase the systems from Fuel
Cell, or they may opt to buy only the power from fuel cells that
NRG will own. FuelCell will build and operate the systems, which
convert convert natural gas into electricity through a chemical
process.  FuelCell’s net loss in its third fiscal quarter narrowed to
$5.6 million, or 3 cents a share, from $9.9 million, or 6 cents,
a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter ended July 31 rose to
$53.7 million from $29.7 million, the Danbury, Connecticut-based
company said in a statement after the close of trading
yesterday. The company’s backlog doubled to $380.8 million.  FuelCell Chief Executive Officer Chip Bottone said the
agreement with NRG will “lead to meaningful order flow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
