Brazilian authorities have canceled
a trip to  Washington  that was designed to prepare for President
Dilma Rousseff’s state visit next month in response to charges
the U.S. spied on the South American nation.  Brazilian officials originally scheduled the trip for Sept.
7 to 11 to organize the details of Rousseff’s state visit,
according to a government official who is close to the president
and asked not to be named because the information isn’t
official. He didn’t know whether Rousseff would cancel her trip
in October.  Brazil ’s government want the U.S. to respond this week to a
report the National Security Agency used software to probe
Rousseff’s communications with several aides, Foreign Minister
Luiz Alberto Figueiredo told reporters in Brasilia Sept. 2. The
spying, if true, would be “inadmissible and unacceptable,” he
said.  “It’s a warning shot,”  David Fleischer , a Brasilia-based
political scientist, said in a phone interview. “If the U.S.
doesn’t provide adequate answers they may cancel the visit
altogether.”  The spying allegations were made Sept. 1 by American
journalist Glenn Greenwald, who obtained secret documents from
fugitive security analyst Edward Snowden in May, on Brazil’s
most-watched TV news magazine, Fantastico.  The U.S. government will address Brazil’s request through
diplomatic channels, a U.S. official with knowledge of the
matter who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly said Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
