Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose to
a 15-month high on signs inflation quickened last month as
protests by farmers and truckers in the Andean nation pushed
food prices higher.  Yields on the nation’s benchmark bonds due 2024 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.18 percent at 10:15
a.m. in Bogota, the highest level on a closing basis since May
2012, according to the central bank. The bond’s price fell 0.341
centavo to 120.771 centavos per peso.  Prices of potatoes, onions and other staples in wholesale
markets jumped last month, according to daily reports from the
national statistics agency. The reports added to declines in
Colombian bonds triggered by speculation that the U.S. Federal
Reserve as soon as this month may begin curtailing monetary
stimulus that has fueled demand for emerging-market assets.  Investors are betting on “inflation surprising on the
upside because of the farmers’ protests,” said John Jairo Ramirez, an analyst at BTG Pactual’s Colombia unit.  Annual inflation quickened to 2.34 percent last month from
2.22 percent in July, according to the median estimate of 23
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The national statistics
agency is slated to release the consumer price index report at 7
p.m. in Bogota.  Farmers and other groups last month began protesting and
blocking roads for greater government support while truckers
asked for lower fuel prices.  Central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe said in a Caracol
Radio interview Sept. 3 that the protests and roadblocks will
have a “light” impact on August consumer prices and that
inflation will end this year at 2.4 percent or 2.5 percent. The
central bank’s mid-point target is 3 percent, plus or minus 1
percentage point.  The peso lost 0.6 percent to 1,954.62 per  U.S. dollar , its
weakest on a closing basis since Nov. 2011.  Colombia’s Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas , who has
repeatedly said the peso’s “equilibrium” level is 1,900 to
1,950, said on Todelar Radio Sept. 3 that there is an “optimum
point after which a weaker  exchange rate  starts to become a
problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
