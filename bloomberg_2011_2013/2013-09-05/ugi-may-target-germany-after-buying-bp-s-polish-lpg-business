UGI Corp. (UGI) , the largest U.S.
distributor of liquefied petroleum gas, will seek takeover
targets in  Germany  after buying BP Plc’s Polish LPG business, a
company official said.  “We’re looking for more acquisitions in Poland and in
 Europe ,” Donald Groth, UGI’s director for corporate
development, told a news briefing in Warsaw today. “Over time
there will be opportunities for us to expand in Germany too.”  UGI’s European subsidiary Flaga GmbH yesterday completed
the acquisition of BP’s business, which sold 150 million gallons
of LPG last year and became one of Poland’s three largest
distributors of the fuel used to power cars and heat homes. With
Flaga, the Pennsylvania-based company operates in 16 European
countries but not Germany, the continent’s biggest economy.  UGI expects its sales in  Poland  will rise to 1.2 billion
zloty ($369 million) in 2014, double the 2012 level. Poland is
Europe’s second-largest consumer of LPG after Italy and uses 2.2
million metric tons of the fuel a year, of which 73 percent
powers cars compared with a European average of 8 percent,
according to the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
