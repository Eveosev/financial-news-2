BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
asset manager, hired Pavan Wadhwa, former head of U.S. dollar
interest rate strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co., to lead a team
focused on global interest rate analysis.  Wadhwa will join BlackRock’s Americas fixed-income group
later this month in New York and report to Bob Miller, head of
the multisector retail and rates team and a portfolio manager on
 BlackRock’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BASIX) , Jessica Greaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based BlackRock, said today
in an e-mail. Prior to joining BlackRock, Wadhwa worked at
JPMorgan for 15 years, including five as head of European and
global interest rate strategy in  London .  BlackRock, which manages $3.86 trillion in assets, has
worked to improve the performance of its actively managed bond
funds as deposits trailed those of index-based investments last
year. The firm reorganized its bond division in 2012, giving
unit heads such as Rick Rieder and Kevin Holt greater autonomy
and accountability. Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink has
said BlackRock is seeing a rotation in fixed income to more
flexible, non-traditional bond products with shorter durations.  Wadhwa, who will be a managing director and the unit’s head
of rates strategy, started his career at BlackRock in 1995,
where he was an associate in the financial modeling group. He
has an MBA and a Ph.D. in finance from the University of Texas
at Austin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
