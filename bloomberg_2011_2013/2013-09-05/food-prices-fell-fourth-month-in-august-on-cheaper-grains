World  food prices  fell for a fourth
month in August to the lowest level in more than a year after
grain prices declined on an outlook for bigger corn and wheat
crops, the UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization reported.  An index of 55 food items tracked by the FAO fell to 201.8
points from a revised 205.6 in July, the Rome-based United
Nations agency wrote in an online report today. The gauge is
down from a record 237.9 points in February 2011 and at the
lowest level since June last year.  World prices for corn fell 14 percent last month, the FAO
said. Global production of the grain will jump 11 percent to
957.1 million metric tons in 2013-14 as U.S. output surges 28
percent, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast last month.  The drop in grain prices “is consistent with expectations
for strong growth in world cereal production this year and
especially, a sharp recovery in maize supplies,” the FAO said,
using another name for corn.  The FAO’s grain price index fell 7.2 percent to 210.9
points last month from 227.3 in July, the lowest level since
September 2010.  “The fall reached 14 percent in the case of maize in spite
of some late-month gains on concerns over drought and heat-stress conditions in the U.S.,” the FAO wrote.  In a separate report, the FAO lifted its outlook for 2013
world grain production by 13.6 million tons to 2.49 billion tons
on an increased outlook for production of wheat and coarse
grains such as corn and sorghum.  Oils, Fats  The FAO’s gauge for cooking oils and fats dropped 3 percent
to 185.5 points. The dairy price index gained 1.2 percent last
month to 239.1. It reached a five-year high in April as drought
cut supplies in New Zealand, the world’s biggest exporter of
milk products.  The FAO’s meat price index advanced 1.3 percent to 175
points, while the sugar index rose 1.1 percent to 241.7 points
on estimates indicating  Brazil  is using more sugarcane for
ethanol production rather than sweetener.  The global food-import bill will probably be stable this
year at $1.094 trillion as cheaper sugar and cooking oil make up
for rising prices of dairy, fish and meat, the FAO predicted in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
