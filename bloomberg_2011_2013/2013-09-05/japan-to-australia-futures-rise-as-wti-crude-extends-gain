Treasury yields slid, the dollar
sank and gold rose as slower-than-forecast jobs growth eased
concern the  Federal Reserve  will cut stimulus. Oil jumped to the
highest since May 2011 and U.S. stocks erased gains amid tension
between American and  Russia  over  Syria ’s civil war.  U.S. 10-year  yields  fell six basis points to 2.93 percent
at 4 p.m. in  New York  after sliding 13 points earlier and
jumping to a two-year high of 3.005 percent before the jobs
report. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index decreased 0.7 percent,
with the yen appreciating 1 percent to 99.07 per dollar. Oil
advanced 2 percent to $110.53 a barrel and gold increased 1
percent to $1,386.50 an ounce. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
ended little changed at 1,655.17 after retreating as much as 0.9
percent and gaining 0.6 percent, its biggest swing since June.  U.S. payrolls rose by 169,000 last month, less than the
180,000 estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists and easing
concern about the size of potential cuts to Fed bond purchases
when policy makers meet Sept. 17-18. Fed Bank of Chicago
President  Charles Evans  said before the report that the central
bank shouldn’t taper its $85 billion in monthly stimulus until
inflation and economic growth pick up. U.S. stocks reversed
gains toward the end of the session as Al-Arabiya TV reported
that Syrian government forces shelled a Damascus neighborhood
with gas, citing unidentified activists.  The payroll data “are surprisingly soft compared to where
expectations have been trending -- it’s still a soft recovery,”
said Kathy Jones, a New York-based fixed-income strategist at
Charles Schwab & Co., which has $2.12 trillion in client assets.
“This has to give them a bit of pause. Coming into this, I
thought tapering was a done deal.”  Jobs, Yields  The gain of 169,000 workers last month followed a revised
104,000 rise in July that was smaller than initially estimated,
Labor Department figures showed. Unemployment dropped to 7.3
percent, the lowest since December 2008, as more workers left
the  labor force .  The jobs data hasn’t derailed economists’ expectations that
the Fed will taper its bond buying by $10 billion a month at its
September meeting. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his colleagues
will reduce Treasury purchases to $35 billion from $45 billion
while maintaining mortgage-bond buying at $40 billion, according
to the median of 34 responses today in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists. That was unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 poll, as was
a projection that the program will end in June.  U.S. five-year yields sank nine basis points to 1.76
percent, while 30-year rates decreased 1.7 basis points to 3.87
percent.  U.S. government debt  has lost investors 4.3 percent
this year, which would be the biggest annual decline since data
going back to 1978, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. Ten-year yields were at a two-year high today before
the jobs report after increasing about 1.25 percentage points
from 1.76 percent at the end of last year.  Putin, Obama  The  S&P 500  started the session higher before sinking to
its lowest level of the day as Russian President  Vladimir Putin 
said at a Group of 20 summit that last month’s chemical attack
in Syria was “provocation” by rebels and Russia will continue
to assist the nation if it’s attacked. U.S. President  Barack
Obama  has said the chemical assault was the work of Syria’s
government and has pressed for U.S. airstrikes. It recovered
losses by 11 a.m. before turning lower in the final hour of
trading and the report of shelling in Damascus.  The benchmark gauge of U.S. equities capped weekly gain of
1.4 percent.  Lennar Corp. and D.R. Horton Inc. jumped at least 1.9
percent to pace gains among homebuilders as bond yields plunged.
American Tower Corp. climbed 4.6 percent after agreeing to
acquire the parent company of rival Global Tower Partners for
about $3.3 Billion. Timken Co. advanced 2.1 percent on plans to
spin off its steel unit. Mattress Firm Holding Corp. dropped 15
percent after cutting its forecast.  Yen Rebounds  The yen rebounded today from its weakest close against the
dollar since July 24. Today’s decline in the Bloomberg U.S.
Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers,
turned it 0.3 percent lower for the week.  German 10-year bund yields fell nine basis points to 1.95
percent after rising above 2 percent for the first time in 17
months yesterday. U.K. 10-year gilt yields lost seven basis
points to 2.94 percent as the securities pared a seventh weekly
decline, the longest run since February 2007.  Stocks Rebound  Almost two stocks gained for every one that declined in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, sending the gauge up 0.5 percent and
extending its weekly advance to almost 3 percent.  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG lost more than 1 percent as
Telegraaf Media Groep NV sold its 6 percent stake in the German
broadcaster. Deutz AG plunged 9.3 percent after an investor sold
an 8.4 percent holding in the maker of  diesel engines . Air
France-KLM Group added 4 percent as the airline said that its
passenger traffic rose 4.9 percent in August.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index increased 0.9 percent,
rising for a third day in its biggest weekly advance in almost
two months.  India ’s S&P BSE Sensex index jumped 1.5 percent and
the rupee gained 1.3 percent, capping its first weekly gain in
four weeks.  Brazil Bull  Brazil’s  Ibovespa (IBOV)  approached a  bull market  amid eased
concern that growth will slow in  China  and as a plunge in the
real boosted the outlook for exports.  The gauge touched 54,112.60 in Sao Paulo trading, rising 20
percent from its July 3 low of 45,044.03, before paring gains.
 Eike Batista ’s OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA and state-run
oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA also were among the biggest
contributors to the Ibovespa’s climb today.  The real has dropped 7.7 percent in the past three months,
the most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, lifting
exporters as it drives up the local-currency receipts on their
overseas sales. The S&P GSCI index of 24 raw materials has
increased more than 5 percent in the same period as
manufacturing strengthened and imports increased in China,
Brazil’s biggest trading partner.  China Trade  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
listed in  Hong Kong  decreased less than 0.1 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.8 percent before the release
of August trade data on Sept. 8. Overseas shipments are expected
to have gained 5.5 percent from a year ago, compared with a 5.1
percent advance in July, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  Tin jumped 4 percent to $22,940 a metric ton, the most
since April, on the London Metal Exchange, the world’s largest
metals bourse.  Indonesia  imposed rules on exporters to trade the
metal on the Indonesia Commodity and Derivatives Exchange.
Indonesia accounts for 40 percent of global tin exports. Tin
producer PT Timah declared force majeure on shipments. Its
shares jumped 5.8 percent in Jakarta.  Silver, oil, nickel and sugar jumped at least 1.7 percent
to lead gains in 21 of 24 commodities in the S&P GSCI Index,
sending the gauge up more than 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
