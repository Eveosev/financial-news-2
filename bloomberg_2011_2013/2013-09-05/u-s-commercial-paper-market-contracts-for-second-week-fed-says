The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  contracted for a second week, led by a
decline in issuance from financial companies.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
dropped $5.1 billion to $1.015 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
Thatâ€™s the lowest level since the period ended Aug. 14.  Commercial paper sold by non-U.S. financial institutions 
declined $700 million to $260 billion, the second straight
decrease, while the  amount issued by U.S.-based banks  dropped
for a third week, falling $5.4 billion to $264.5 billion,
according to the Fed.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
