Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc. (KW) , a real
estate investment company, and Varde bought eight shopping
centers in the U.K. out of administration for 250 million pounds
($390 million), adding to its European assets.  The portfolio totals 2.3 million square feet (214,000
square meters) and 85 percent of the gross income comes from
retailers such as Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Asda,
Kennedy-Wilson said in a statement today. The  Beverly Hills ,
California-based company plans to renovate the properties and
increase occupancy.  “In addition to asset management upside, there is the
opportunity to benefit from improving economic and market
conditions,” Mary Ricks, chief executive officer of Kennedy
Wilson Europe, said in the statement.  Kennedy-Wilson’s other investments in  Europe  include debt
secured by real estate in the U.K., according to an earnings
statement Aug. 6. In the second quarter, the company and an
equity partner foreclosed on an office building and adjacent
3.5-acre site in Dublin.  Kennedy-Wilson had risen 32 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
