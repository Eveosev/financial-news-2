Go-Ahead Group Plc (GOG)  said a push to
win acceptance of “smart ticketing” among U.K. bus customers
outside London has been more effective than expected, lifting
earnings at the business more than 10 percent above its target.  Operating profit from the bus unit reached 78.2 million
pounds ($122 million) in the year to June 29, 8 million pounds
higher than anticipated, as Go-Ahead targets divisional earnings
of 100 million pounds by fiscal 2016, the company said today.  Go-Ahead has issued more than 400,000 of its swipe-to-enter
smartcards and built a database of 600,000 users as it seeks to
widen the appeal of a technology already engrained in London in
a push to lure people who commute by the car. The Newcastle upon
Tyne-based company also generated more than 1 million pounds in
12 months from 65,000 “m-ticketing” downloads via mobile phone.  “Oyster cards transformed travel in London when they were
introduced 10 years ago and we’re now seeing a similar shift in
other British cities,” Chief Executive Officer  David Brown  said
in an interview. Price differentials between smartcards and
traditional tickets have been kept smaller than in the capital
in order to avoid alienating the existing client base, he said.  Shares of Go-Ahead, which spent 45.3 million pounds buying
251 new buses in the fiscal year, rose as much as 5.2 percent,
the biggest gain since Oct. 18, 2012, and were trading 3.1
percent higher at 1,521 pence as of 10:07 a.m. in London.  U.S. Bus Concern  Brown said expansion plans for the company’s U.S. school
bus business, established in 2010 to compete with bigger
operations run by U.K. rivals  FirstGroup Plc (FGP)  and  National
Express Group Plc (NEX) , has been frustrated by a lack of value in
available contracts and acquisitions.  The venture, run in conjunction with U.S. partner Cook-Illinois, operates about 120 yellow buses in  St. Louis ,
 Missouri , and Go-Ahead had said the fleet might grow to 300
vehicles. The continuation of the relationship will now be
reviewed when it comes up for renewal, Brown said.  “It’s moving slowly,” he said. “Unless you’re actually
putting buses into St. Louis or have a huge fleet, the synergies
are not really there.”  Go-Ahead, Britain’s No. 1 train operator by passenger
numbers, posted an operating profit of 102.5 pounds for the 12
months, which while 7 percent lower than a year earlier was
“slightly ahead” of company expectations, Brown said.  Rail earnings have fallen off as franchises near the end of
their terms, limiting returns, and the company said it’s focused
on winning the expanded Thameslink contract and another to run
the new Crossrail line spanning  London  from east to west.  To contact the reporter on this story:
