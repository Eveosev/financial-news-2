Bigger harvests of corn, rice, wheat
and soybeans are forecast to boost world stockpiles of the crops
in the 2013-14 season, according to the Agricultural Market
Information System set up by Group of 20 countries.  Corn inventories will jump the most among the four
agricultural commodities tracked by AMIS as bigger crops more
than make up for a gain in usage of almost 6 percent on higher
feed and industrial demand, according to a  report  published
online today.  Corn is the worst performer in the S&P GSCI gauge of 24 raw
materials in the past 12 months, sliding 41 percent amid an
outlook for rising production of the grain. Wheat and soybeans
are the fourth- and fifth-worst performers.  “In spite of weather conditions causing sharp price
movements in August, global harvests for all AMIS crops are
expected to be historically large, with overall production
exceeding utilization and resulting in much higher world
inventories,” AMIS wrote.  World corn production is forecast to climb to 983 million
metric tons from 875 million tons, lifting ending stocks to 176
million tons from 135 million tons. That compared with last
month’s forecast by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  for
output of 957 million tons and stocks of 150 million tons.  The corn production outlook was raised by 11 million tons
from July on a larger officially reported crop in  Argentina  and
an improved outlook for the European Union and Ukraine, the
report showed.  Wheat, Rice  Farmers around the world will harvest 710 million tons of
wheat in 2013-14, from 660 million tons the previous season,
according to the AMIS report, up 6 million tons from a prior
outlook. That will lift stocks to 170 million tons from 157
million tons.  Rice output is seen climbing to 497 million tons from 491
million tons in 2012-13, with stocks advancing to 181 million
tons from 174 million tons.  World production of soybeans is predicted to rise to a
record 284 million tons from 266 million tons, bolstering ending
stocks to 31 million tons from 25 million tons, according to the
AMIS report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
