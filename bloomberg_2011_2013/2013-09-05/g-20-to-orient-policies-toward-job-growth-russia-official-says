Group of 20 nations are planning to
commit to orienting their financial and monetary policies toward
job creation, Russian Deputy Labor Minister Alexey Vovchenko
said in  St. Petersburg  today.  In a communique to be issued at the end of a two-day summit
tomorrow, the group will agree that financial and fiscal
commitments need to avoid harming the labor market as job growth
is one of the main drivers of economic growth, Vovchenko said in
an interview.  Emerging markets , which helped pull the world out of a
recession after the global financial crisis, now face an exodus
of cash and sliding currencies in anticipation of the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s eventual tapering of its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases. Developed economies are turning into
global growth engines as some emerging-market counterparts
decelerate, the  International Monetary Fund  said in a report for
G-20 leaders.  “It’s through the prism of  job creation  that these
policies should be adopted,” Vovchenko said. “Job creation is
seen as on of the engines of the locomotives economic growth,
which stimulates demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
