Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC) , a Calgary-based
oil producer with operations in Colombia, rose to its highest in
two months on speculation it is moving closer to a deal to sell
its stake in a pipeline to raise cash.  The shares increased 2.6 percent to 12,500 pesos at 12:43
p.m. in Bogota, the highest level on a closing basis since June
18. The company was the best performer on the Colcap index,
which rose 0.3 percent.  Petrominerales said last month that it was joining three
other  oil companies  to sell their combined 27 percent stake in
the country’s Ocensa pipeline, with a closing projected for the
fourth quarter. Petrominerales has said the proceeds are needed
to help make debt payments.  “We should hear news soon on the pipeline disposition, and
maybe people in  Colombia  are buying for that reason,” Darren Engels, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary, said
in a telephone interview.  The sales processes are “well-advanced,” Petrominerales
said in an August presentation on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
