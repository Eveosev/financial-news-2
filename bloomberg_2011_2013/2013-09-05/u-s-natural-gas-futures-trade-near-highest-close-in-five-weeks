Natural gas futures rose to a five-week high for a second day in  New York  on speculation that
government data will show a smaller-than-normal gain in
inventories of the power-plant fuel.  Gas climbed as much as 1 percent. An Energy Information
Administration report scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
Washington may show stockpiles increased by 54 billion cubic
feet in the week ended Aug. 30, according to the median of 25
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average
gain for the period is 60 billion.  “It was hot in the Midwest last week and that’s why some
people are looking for numbers between 45 and 50,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford , Connecticut. “Prices are stabilizing and moving
higher. The rally has a little bit more ahead of it.”  Natural gas for October delivery rose 2.8 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.711 per million British thermal units at 9:09
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 34
percent below the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices
are up 11 percent this year. The futures touched $3.719, the
highest level since July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
