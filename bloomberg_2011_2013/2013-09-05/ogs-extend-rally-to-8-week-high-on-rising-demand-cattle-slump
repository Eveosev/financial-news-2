Hog futures extended gains to an
eight-week high on signs that demand for U.S. pork is
increasing. Cattle prices dropped.  About 443,000 hogs were processed in the week ending Aug.
31, up 7 percent from a week earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Wholesale-pork  prices  are up 1 percent
this week, USDA data show, after the Labor Day holiday on Sept.
2, which is the third most-popular day for outdoor barbecues,
according to an industry group.  “Product prices improved after Labor Day,” Lawrence Kane,
a senior market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group, said in a
telephone interview from  Yates City ,  Illinois . “That’s a signal
to me there was good clearance over the holiday.”  Hog futures for October settlement climbed 0.7 percent to
