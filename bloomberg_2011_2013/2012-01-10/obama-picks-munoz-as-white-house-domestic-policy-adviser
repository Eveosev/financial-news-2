President  Barack Obama  has named an
administration liaison to the nation’s Hispanic community as the
director of his Domestic Policy Council, the White House
announced.  Cecilia Munoz has been serving as director of
intergovernmental affairs for the White House, coordinating with
state and local governments. She succeeds  Melody Barnes , who
stepped down last year. The director of the Domestic Policy
Council coordinates policy making and supervises the execution
of domestic policy, the White House said in a statement.  Obama said in the statement that Munoz “has done an
extraordinary job working on behalf of middle class families.”  Before joining the administration, Munoz was an executive
at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights
advocacy group. Obama is counting on turnout and support from
Hispanics in his re-election bid this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
