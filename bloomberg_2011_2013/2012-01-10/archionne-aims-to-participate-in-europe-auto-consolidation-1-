Sergio Marchionne, who runs  Fiat SpA (F) 
and Chrysler Group LLC, said he’s willing to participate in
industry consolidation in Europe and would consider adding a
third partner before a planned merger between Chrysler and Fiat.  Marchionne said he’s not closing the door on any potential
partners when asked if he’d consider linking up with  General
Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel unit in Europe. The CEO said he’s not
currently talking to anyone about a combination.  “I was at dinner with him Sunday night,” GM Vice Chairman
Stephen Girsky said today of Marchionne, adding that Opel was
not up for sale. “He didn’t say a word about” partnering Fiat
with Opel.  Fiat and Chrysler may seek a third partner to increase
efficiencies and cut development costs as the European debt
crisis eats into the Italian carmaker’s sales, Marchionne said
yesterday in Detroit. Fiat owns 58.5 percent of the U.S.
automaker.  Marchionne also said he’s not in discussion with PSA
Peugeot Citroen for a combination. Europe’s second-largest
carmaker after  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  is ready to discuss a possible
alliance with Fiat, Corriere Della Sera reported earlier today,
citing “authoritative” sources. Cecile Damide, a Peugeot
spokeswoman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
