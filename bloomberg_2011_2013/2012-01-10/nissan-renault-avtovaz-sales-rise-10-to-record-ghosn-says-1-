Carlos Ghosn , chief executive
officer of  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  and  Renault SA (RNO) , said the two
carmakers and Russian partner OAO  AvtoVAZ (AVAZ)  increased their
combined vehicle sales by 10 percent last year to a record.  Sales reached 4.67 million at Yokohama-based Nissan, 2.72
million at Renault and 638,000 at AvtoVAZ, Ghosn said today at
the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit. That helped
combined sales climb to 8.03 million last year from 7.28 million
in 2010, he said.  “Partnerships are key to regional growth and a key reason
the alliance achieved a new sales record,” he said. “Our
industry has high fixed costs. Quickly meeting demands of new
customers around the world is easier when you share investment
costs through strategic alliances.”  Nissan’s growth in the U.S. and China helped the company
outperform  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co., which saw
sales decline last year after natural disasters in Japan and
Thailand disrupted production. The company is planning to
increase its reliance on those markets this year amid a
projected drop in European demand.  In the U.S., Nissan boosted sales 15 percent last year,
following an 18 percent increase in deliveries in 2010. Ghosn
said separately yesterday that his goal is to raise Nissan sales
sufficiently to give the company a 10 percent global market
share.  AvtoVAZ Deal  Nissan and Renault are in talks to own a majority of
AvtoVAZ, with Ghosn saying this week a deal may be completed
within weeks. Renault bought 25 percent of Russia’s largest
carmaker in 2008 for $1 billion.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest carmaker, said this month
it saw group sales climb 14 percent to 8.16 million in 2011.
that’s similar to the growth reported by South Korea’s  Hyundai
Motor Co. (005380)  and partner  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)   Ghosn said today the alliance will help them boost sales of
electric vehicles to a cumulative 1.5 million units by 2016.
Nissan, which sold 21,000 Leaf electric cars in 2011, plans to
double deliveries of those automobiles this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
