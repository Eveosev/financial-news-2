Airbus (EAD)  SAS, the worldâ€™s largest
passenger-jet maker, will transfer work to produce wing panels
for the A320 single-aisle aircraft to Korean Aerospace
Industries from Broughton in the U.K. after production gained.  The decision will allow Airbus to focus resources on areas
such as wing assembly at its Broughton facility that add more
value, the Toulouse, France-based company said in an e-mailed
statement. Resources freed up through the transfer will help
support the increase in production rates at Broughton, the
company said. As part of the relocation, Airbus will shift about
200 employees within Broughton, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
