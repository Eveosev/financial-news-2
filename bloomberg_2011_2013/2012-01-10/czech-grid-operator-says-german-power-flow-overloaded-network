The Czech  power grid  in 2011 was
repeatedly and “more frequently” overloaded with unscheduled
flows of electricity caused by renewable energy from  Germany ,
jeopardizing the security of the network, grid operator CEPS
 said .  The most critical situation occurred in the period between
Nov. 25 and Dec. 16 when unscheduled power flows amounted to
3,500 megawatts while the usual value is about 1,000 megawatts,
the Czech operator said in a statement today on its website.  The near-emergency situation in the network was mainly
caused by excessive power output from German wind farms on windy
days. The shutdown of German nuclear plants, the rise of
installed capacity in photovoltaic power plants in Germany and
intensive power trading on spot markets also played a part in
the network overloads,  CEPS (PCZPBL01)  said.  CEPS has implemented measures to identify and predict such
situations and said the risk of the recurrence of such
situations in the future still persists and the transmission
networks in the region must be reinforced as quickly as
possible, it said.  The country may have to install transformers at the borders
to protect the grid at a cost of 2 billion koruna ($99 million),
CEPS chief Vladimir Tosovsky told reporters at a press
conference in  Prague  today, newswire CTK reported. CEPS already
plans to invest 3.5 billion koruna in the network in 2012, the
newswire reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
