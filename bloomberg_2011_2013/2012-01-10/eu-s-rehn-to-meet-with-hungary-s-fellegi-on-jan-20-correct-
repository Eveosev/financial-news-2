European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  will discuss Hungary’s request
financial assistance and its new central-bank law with the
nation’s chief aid negotiator next week, the EU said.  “There is a wide range of issues” on the agenda for the
Jan. 20 meeting between Rehn and Hungary’s Tamas Fellegi, the
official in charge of securing international aid for the
country, Rehn’s spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, told reporters today
in Brussels. The officials also will discuss Hungary’s efforts
to rein in its  budget deficit , he said.  The EU and the International Monetary Fund last month
suspended aid talks with Hungary after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  pressed ahead with legislation that the nation’s central
bank said violates its independence. The law came into effect on
Jan. 1.  Fellegi started preparatory talks with IMF representatives
in  Washington  yesterday and is scheduled to meet with IMF
Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Jan. 12, state newswire
MTI reported. Orban said on Jan. 8 that Hungary is open to
bailout talks without any preconditions and would accept “any
kind” of credit line that strengthens market financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
