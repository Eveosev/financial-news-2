Belarus’s inflation soared in
December to the highest since at least 2000 after the national
currency’s devaluation fanned price growth.  Consumer prices rose 108.7 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 106 percent in November, the state statistics
committee, based in the capital, Minsk,  said  on its website.
Year-end inflation was 9.9 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
