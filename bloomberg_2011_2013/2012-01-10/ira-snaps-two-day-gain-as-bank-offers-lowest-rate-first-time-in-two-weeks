The lira weakened after two days of
gains prompted the central bank to offer funding at its lowest
one-week repo rate for the first time in almost two weeks.  The Turkish currency depreciated 0.2 percent against the
dollar at 1.8723 at 10:49 a.m. in Istanbul, reversing earlier
gains, after the central bank offered to lend 7 billion liras at
5.75 annual  interest rate  in a repo auction today. The bank last
provided funding at this level on Dec. 28.  “This signals that the Turkish central bank is now more
comfortable at the exchange rate level given aggressive
intervention over the past week,” Timothy Ash, chief emerging
markets economist at the Royal Bank of  Scotland  in  London , said
in a client note.  The lira has gained 1 percent this year, making it the
best-performing among emerging-market currencies in  Europe , the
Middle East and Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
after losing 18 percent last year, the biggest decline among
emerging markets. The bank has spent at least $15 billion of its
reserves since August to support the lira and rein in inflation
which at 10.5 percent in December was the highest in three years
and at twice the official target for 2011.  Yields (BENCH)  on two-year Turkish bonds climbed 10 basis points,
or 0.1 percentage point, to 11.37 percent, a Turk Ekonomi
Bankasi index of the securities showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
