The  European Central Bank  said
overnight deposits from commercial banks rose to a new record.  Euro-area banks parked 481.9 billion euros ($614.5 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based ECB on Jan. 9, up from the previous
record of 463.6 billion euros set a day earlier. That’s the most
since the euro was introduced in 1999.  The ECB last month loaned 523 banks a record 489 billion
euros for three years to keep credit flowing to the 17-nation
euro economy during the sovereign debt crisis. It loaned the
money at its benchmark rate of 1 percent. The surge in deposits
suggests banks are placing excess cash back with the ECB at the
overnight rate of 0.25 percent, incurring a loss rather than
lending it for more elsewhere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
