German bunds fell for the first time
in four days before  Chancellor Angela Merkel  meets International
Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  amid optimism
leaders are taking steps to resolve the region’s debt crisis.  Ten-year German securities underperformed their euro-area
peers as European stocks rose, reducing demand for the safest
fixed-income assets. Merkel said yesterday euro-area nations are
considering accelerating capital contributions to the region’s
bailout fund. French bonds rose for a second day after  Fitch
Ratings  said the nation will probably retain its AAA credit
grade. Greek notes climbed after the government sold bills.  “The markets are giving the European leaders a little bit
of time,” said Elwin de Groot, a market economist at Rabobank
Nederland in Utrecht, the Netherlands. “It’s smart they’ve
started their meetings earlier in the year. It gives the
impression that they are on the ball, and that’s giving a bit of
a positive impulse to the market.”  The German 10-year yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.88 percent at 4:21 p.m. London time. The
2 percent bond due January 2022 dropped 0.32, or 3.2 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,280) face amount, to 101.075. The two-year yield
rose three basis points to 0.17 percent.  Merkel will meet Lagarde at 8 p.m. in Berlin today, while
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  will hold talks with Lagarde
tomorrow in Paris. Merkel and Sarkozy yesterday outlined the
increased pace of their response as the financial crisis that
began in  Greece  in 2009 entered its third year.  The  Stoxx Europe 600  Index of shares climbed 1.8 percent,
and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.1 percent.  French Bonds  French 10-year bonds gained after  David Riley , head of
Fitch’s sovereign-debt unit, said the country is likely to keep
its  credit rating  unless the European debt crisis worsens.  “We’re unlikely to downgrade France in 2012 unless there
is a serious intensification of the euro-zone crisis,” he said
at a conference today in London. Fitch cut  France ’s credit
outlook to negative on Dec. 16, citing the “heightened risk of
contingent liabilities” from the euro-region crisis.  The French 10-year yield fell six basis points to 3.25
percent. The extra yield that investors demand to hold the
securities instead of German bunds shrank 10 basis points to 137
basis points.  The spread between 10-year Italian and German yields
contracted seven basis points to 524 basis points, and the
Spanish yield gap shrank 11 basis points to 360 basis points.  Default Risk  The cost of insuring against default on European sovereign
and corporate debt fell as investors pared bets the debt crisis
will worsen. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
credit-default swaps on 15 governments dropped 12 basis points
to 378.5. A decline signals an improvement in perceptions of
 credit quality .  Volatility on Portuguese sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by Austrian securities,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield
spreads and credit-default swaps. The change in spread for
Portuguese debt was 4.6 times the 90-day average, the Bloomberg
gauge showed.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield dropped 10 basis points to 12.96
percent. The two-year yield slid 165 basis points to 13.10
percent after falling as much as 188 basis points, the biggest
intraday decline since July 22.  Greek Notes  Greek notes climbed after the government sold 1.625 billion
euros of 182-day bills. The two-year yield fell 27 basis points
to 175.89 percent, and the price rose to 21.06 percent of face
value. The yield earlier reached a record high 184.56 percent.  The Netherlands auctioned 3.105 billion euros of notes
maturing in April 2015, less than its original target of as much
as 3.5 billion euros. The securities were sold at a yield of
0.853 percent.  The Dutch two-year yield advanced two basis points to 0.24
percent, and the 10-year yield climbed three basis points to
2.26 percent.  German two-year  note yields  earlier dropped to match a
record low after an auction of six-month bills yesterday drew a
yield of minus 0.01 percent, the first time it sold the
securities with a negative yield.  Short-maturity yields are “clearly a signal that investors
are still concerned, and don’t mind not getting a lot of return
on their fixed-income investments because they’d rather preserve
capital,” said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank
A/S in Copenhagen. “I don’t expect anything big to come out of
that meeting. There are a lot of good intentions, but when it
comes to implementation there’s still a lot of skepticism.”  German bonds gained 9.7 percent last year, the most since
2008, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Investors bought the
securities as the debt crisis threatened to spread to the euro
area’s bigger economies. They are little changed this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
