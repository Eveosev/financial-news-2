European cocoa usage may have
climbed to the highest since at least 1999 in the fourth quarter
as bean processors took advantage of lower prices.  The so-called grind was probably up 7.5 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to the median of
nine traders, brokers and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.
That would take the total to 368,109 metric tons, the most since
at least 1999, according to data from the European Cocoa
Association. The grindings report is set for release Jan. 13.  Cocoa fell 32 percent in  London  last year on signs of
plentiful supplies in West Africa. Global production was 341,000
tons higher than consumption in the 2010-11 season that ended in
September, according to the International Cocoa Organization.  “Traders are expecting higher grindings as processors are
taking advantage of the current low price to stock up,” Edward
George, a soft commodities specialist at Lome, Togo-based lender
Ecobank Transnational Inc., said by phone yesterday.  Global bean grindings will climb 3 percent in 2011-12,
down from a 4.5 percent increase a year earlier, Gerry Manley, managing director and global head for cocoa at
Singapore-based Olam International Ltd., said on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
