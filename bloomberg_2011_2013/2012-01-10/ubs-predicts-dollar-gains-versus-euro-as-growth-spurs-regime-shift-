The dollar will climb to its
strongest since July 2010 versus the euro as the U.S. reduces
its dependence on oil imports and faster growth draws investors
to the nation’s assets, UBS AG said.  The U.S. currency has gained 2.4 percent over the past
three months against nine developed-nation peers tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes amid prospects an
expansion in the world’s largest economy will outpace growth in
the euro area and  Japan . The greenback will also benefit as U.S.
firms tap the nation’s shale gas, lowering its current account
deficit, UBS said.  “Foreign exchange participants should maintain a bullish
stance on the greenback in 2012,” Mansoor Mohi-uddin,
Singapore-based head of currency strategy at UBS, wrote in a
note to clients today. “The current account deficit is likely
to improve as U.S. firms exploit large shale gas reserves,
reducing dependence on energy imports, while the capital account
should benefit as dollar-based investors slow foreign asset
purchases.”  The dollar traded at $1.2791 per euro as of 6:18 a.m. in
 London  from $1.2765 in  New York  yesterday, when it rose to a 16-
month high of $1.2666. The U.S. currency will strengthen to
$1.25 in 12 months, UBS forecasts, compared with the median
prediction for it to decline to $1.30 by Dec. 31 in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts. The dollar last traded at $1.25 in July
2010.  Producing natural gas from shale will support 870,000 U.S.
jobs and add $118 billion to economic growth in the next four
years, a report from HIS  Global Insight  said Dec. 6.  Investors Flows  UBS predicts a narrowing in the U.S.’s current account
deficit may be accompanied by an end to a decade-long
diversification away from dollar assets by the nation’s fund
managers, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds.  “Dollar-based investors remaining in U.S. markets would be
highly beneficial for the greenback,” Mohi-uddin wrote. “It
would also result in a regime shift so that the currency rises
rather than falls when investors seek risk, just as it did in
the 1990s.”  Gross domestic product for the U.S. will increase 2.1
percent this year compared with a 0.2 percent contraction in the
euro area and 1.7 percent expansion in Japan, economists polled
by Bloomberg News predict.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed in 2011
while the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 5.5 percent. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 11 percent and the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index plunged 17 percent in 2011.  The U.S. dollar’s share of global foreign-exchange reserves
climbed in the third quarter to the highest since late 2010,
while holdings of euros declined to a three-year low,
International Monetary Fund data showed last month. The U.S.
currency’s portion rose to 61.7 percent in the period ended
Sept. 30 from 60.3 percent in the prior quarter, according to
the IMF.  To contact the reporters on this story:
