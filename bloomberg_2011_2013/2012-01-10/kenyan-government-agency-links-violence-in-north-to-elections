Clashes in northern  Kenya  that the
 United Nations  says have killed at least 46 people are linked to
general elections scheduled to take place in the East African
nation later this year, a government agency said.  “The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has been
to Isiolo and Moyale and has established that the ongoing
violent conflicts are politically motivated in anticipation of
the 2012 elections,” the commission said in an e-mailed
statement today from Nairobi, the capital. It didn’t provide
further details.  Intercommunal fighting between the Borana and Gabra
livestock-herding communities around Moyale, about 590
kilometers (367 miles) northeast of Nairobi, has also  displaced 
thousands of people, the UN humanitarian agency said last week.
The violence is being fuelled by competition for land for
grazing and livestock, it said.  Two months of violence following a disputed presidential
election in December 2007 left 1,500 people dead and forced
another 300,000 to flee their homes. The ethnic clashes were
triggered after the election returned President Mwai Kibaki to
office, and which his political rival  Raila Odinga  said was
rigged.  The Kenyan commission called on communities in the affected
areas to immediately cease hostilities and begin talks to end
the conflict.  “We appeal to the political and local leadership,
particularly the members of parliament to refrain from any acts
that will exacerbate the already volatile situation,” Chairman
Mzalendo Kibunja said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
