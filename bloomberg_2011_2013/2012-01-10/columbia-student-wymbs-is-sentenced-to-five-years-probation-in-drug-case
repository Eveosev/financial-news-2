Michael Wymbs, one of five Columbia
University students arrested in December 2010 and charged with
selling drugs on the  New York  school’s campus, was sentenced to
five years’ probation.  Wymbs, 23, of New York, who was accused of selling LSD and
Ecstasy, pleaded guilty in November to third-degree attempted
criminal possession of a controlled substance. Three of the five
students who were arrested in the case have pleaded guilty.  Wymbs has remained drug free for 13 months, has a “great
job” working in the math and statistics field and is studying
math at the  City University  of New York, where he’s maintaining
a grade-point average of 3.92, his attorney, Michael Bachner,
told reporters outside court.  “One day I think we’ll be reading about Mr. Wymbs
accepting a  Nobel Prize  and not about his time in court,”
Bachner said. “He is truly a really brilliant guy.”  Prosecutors said undercover officers, in a five-month
investigation nicknamed “Operation Ivy League,” spent $11,000
buying drugs including cocaine, marijuana, Ecstasy and LSD-laced
candy, with most sales taking place in common areas and bedrooms
of three fraternities at the university.  The case is People v. David, 00038N/2011, New York state
 Supreme Court , New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
