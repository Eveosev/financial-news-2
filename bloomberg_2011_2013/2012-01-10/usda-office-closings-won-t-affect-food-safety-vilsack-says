A  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
plan to close 259 domestic offices because of budget cuts will
have “no impact whatsoever” on  food safety , Agriculture
Secretary Tom Vilsack said.  Agency inspectors who work at every meat-processing plant
in the country will not be affected, Vilsack said today on a
conference call with reporters. The USDA announced the closings
yesterday, saying they were part of a plan to save $150 million
annually.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
