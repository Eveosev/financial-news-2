Manhattan  office leasing climbed 16
percent last year as tenants agreed to occupy the most space in
more than a decade,  Cushman & Wakefield  Inc. said.  A total of 30.1 million square feet (2.8 million square
meters) of new leases were signed in 2011, the New York-based
brokerage said in a statement today. That was the most since the
31.5 million square feet of deals reached in 2000, according to
Cushman. The vacancy rate fell to 9.1 percent from 10.5 percent
at the end of 2010.  “You had pent-up demand coming out of the recession,”
said Joe Harbert, Cushman’s chief operating officer for the  New
York  metropolitan area. “Corporations realized that, relative
to the past market, this was a market in which a company go
could go out and, for a reasonable price, see a lot of
alternatives and find high-quality space.”  Financial companies’ demand for office space has held up in
the face of job reductions and the slowdown in the  U.S. economy ,
executives from Boston Properties Inc. and Brookfield Office
Properties Inc. said in September. Last year, financial services
firms worldwide disclosed plans to eliminate more than 200,000
jobs as they grapple with market turmoil and fallout from
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  ‘Very Cautious’  The industry that accounts for about a third of office
space leased in Manhattan is in “very cautious mode,” and the
cutbacks will probably curb leasing deals, according to Ken McCarthy, Cushman’s senior economist and senior managing
director for research.  “This year is going to be the year that New York doesn’t
outperform, but matches what’s going on elsewhere,” McCarthy
said at a briefing today.  In 2011, there were 51 lease agreements for more than
100,000 square feet, the most since 2004, when Cushman began
tracking the data, Harbert said. Of those deals, 22 were
renewals.  For Class A  office space  in Midtown, the average asking
rent rose 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier
to $71.22 a square foot. The rate is up 9.5 percent from the
bottom reached in the first three months of 2010, Harbert said.  Net effective rents, or what tenants actually paid,
averaged $56.47 per square foot, up 12 percent from a year
earlier, according to the report.  Asking rents borough-wide climbed 5.3 percent from a year
earlier, to $57.23 a square foot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
