Klaus Liebscher, a member of the
European Central Bank’s Governing Council when the euro was
introduced, said European politicians were too generous in
allowing who could join the common currency at its inception.  “The selection of the first 11 member states, and of the
12th,  Greece , were purely political decisions which were handled
too generously,” Liebscher said in Vienna in a speech marking
the 10th anniversary of the introduction of euro coins and
bills. “I personally preferred a currency union in the order of
seven or eight countries, but I was told emphatically that this
wasn’t realistic politically.”  Liebscher was a member of the ECB’s policy-making body as
the Austrian central bank’s Governor until 2008, when he was
succeeded by  Ewald Nowotny .  To contact the reporter on this story:
