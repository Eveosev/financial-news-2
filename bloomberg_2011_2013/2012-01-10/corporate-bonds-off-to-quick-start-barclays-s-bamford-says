Corporate bond issuance is
accelerating around the world as the European Central Bank’s
emergency lending program eases funding concerns, according to
Barclays Capital’s  Mark Bamford .  “We’re off to a really quick start here both in the U.S.
and in Europe,” Bamford, the London-based bank’s head of global
fixed-income syndicate, said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.”  Bond issuers are rushing to take advantage of positive
sentiment by raising money on days when markets are rising,
Bamford said.  SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-biggest brewer
by volume,  Macy’s Inc. (M)  and Valspar Corp. are among companies
marketing bonds today, according to people with knowledge of the
transactions.  “This risk-on, risk-off situation that we see in a lot of
different asset classes, we see in the new-issue markets as
well,” Bamford said.  The  European Central Bank  last month loaned 523 banks a
record 489 billion euros ($625 billion) for three years to keep
credit flowing to the 17-nation euro economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
