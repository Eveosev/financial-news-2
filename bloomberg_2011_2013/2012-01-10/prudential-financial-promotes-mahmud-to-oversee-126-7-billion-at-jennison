Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, promoted Mehdi Mahmud to chief
executive officer of Jennison Associates LLC, the investment
unit with about $126.7 billion in assets under management.  Mahmud, 39, who was chief operating officer of the unit, is
taking the CEO post from Dennis Kass, 61, who is remaining
chairman, according to a statement today from the Jennison
business of  Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential. Ken Moore, 41,
previously the chief administrative officer, was named COO.  Prudential is promoting executives after hiring  David Hunt ,
who joined the insurer in November as head of investments. Hunt,
a former senior partner at McKinsey & Co., is in charge of an
operation that oversees more than $580 billion as CEO of
Prudential Investment Management.  “Mehdi’s experience as chief operating officer at Jennison
and Dennis’ ongoing active role will ensure continuity and
stability,” Hunt said in the statement.  The promotions have “no impact” on Jennison’s investment
teams, the company said. Jennison, which began managing money in
1969, sells mutual funds and other investment services to a
customer base that include institutions and private clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
