Ukraineâ€™s winter wheat harvest may
decline to 13 million to 14 million metric tons this year from
22.4 million tons in 2011, according to agriculture researcher
UkrAgroConsult.  The country will probably export 6.3 million tons of wheat
in the marketing year that started July 1, the Kiev-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
