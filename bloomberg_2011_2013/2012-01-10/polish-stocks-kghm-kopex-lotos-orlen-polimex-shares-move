Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  gained 25.89,
or 1.2 percent, to 2,152.60 at 1:40 p.m. in Warsaw, climbing
from a three-week low.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper and
silver producer, jumped 2.8 percent to 114.2 zloty, rising for
the first time in five days. Copper rose the most in a week in
London as imports of the metal into China, the world’s biggest
consumer, advanced for a seventh month to a record.  Kopex SA (KPX)   rose 3.5 percent to 20.5 zloty, snapping
a three-day decline. The supervisory board of Poland’s biggest
producer of mining machinery dismissed Chief Executive Officer
Marian Kostempski without giving any reason. The board will
appoint Krzysztof Jedrzejewski, who owns a majority stake in the
company, as CEO, according to a regulatory statement today.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s biggest oil company, added
2.9 percent to 34.54 zloty, snapping a two-day drop.  Grupa Lotos
SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, increased 2.1 percent
to 21.89 zloty. Oil rose on growing concern the dispute between
Iran and western governments may lead to a disruption in Middle
East crude exports.  Polimex-Mostostal SA (PXM)  , which won a 9.4 billion-
zloty ($2.7 billion) order to build a generating unit for
utility PGE SA in November, jumped 6 percent to 1.77 zloty,
heading for the highest close in four months. The Polish Appeal
Chamber will either annul the case brought by rival Alstom SA
against PGE for rejecting its bid for the contract or rule
against the appeal tomorrow, Malgorzata Streciwilk, a
spokeswoman for the Chamber, said by phone yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
