Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the offshore oil
driller facing a possible downgrade to junk-credit status, will
pay interim Chief Financial Officer Greg Cauthen $576,000 in
salary and bonus to stay with the company for six months.  Cauthen replaces former CFO Ricardo Rosa, who is stepping
down after the Vernier, Switzerland-based rig operator was
warned by Moody’s Investors Service that it may lose its
investment-grade debt rating because of rising costs. Transocean
disclosed Cauthen’s pay package in a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
