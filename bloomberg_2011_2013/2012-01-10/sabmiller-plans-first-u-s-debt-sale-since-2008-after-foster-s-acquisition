SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-
biggest brewer by volume, issued $7 billion of debt in the
largest U.S. bond sale since 2010 as it seeks to pay back debt
tied to last year’s acquisition of Foster’s Group Ltd.  The company sold $1 billion of three-year notes, $2 billion
of five-year notes, $2.5 billion of 10-year notes and $1.5
billion of 30-year bonds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. London-based SABMiller last tapped the U.S. bond
market in July 2008, when it issued $1.25 billion of bonds. At
least $12.4 billion of corporate debt was sold or set to be
offered today in dollars, the data show.  SABMiller’s purchase of the Australian Foster’s, valued at
A$12.4 billion ($12.8 billion) and completed last month, is the
biggest takeover of a brewer since InBev NV purchased Anheuser-
Busch Cos. for $52 billion in 2008 to create No. 1 brewer
Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. SABMiller had to  sell bonds  to
refinance an $8 billion bridge loan used for the acquisition,
CreditSights Inc. said in a Dec. 19 report. The purchase
included $1.93 billion of net debt, Bloomberg data show.  SABMiller’s 1.85 percent, three-year notes yield 150 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the 2.45 percent,
five-year debt paid a spread of 165 basis points, the 3.75
percent, 10-year notes yield 185 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and the 4.95 percent, 30-year bonds pay 200
basis points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The 1.85
percent coupon was the lowest on record for the company, the
data show.  Macy’s Rating  SABMiller sold $700 million of 6.5 percent, 10-year notes
in its July 2008 sale at a 270 basis point spread, Bloomberg
data show, showing that borrowing costs for the company have
tumbled since then.  Macy’s Inc. (M) , the Cincinnati-based department-store chain,
also marketed bonds today for the first time since 2008 after
regaining an investment-grade  credit rating  from Moody’s
Investors Service yesterday, said a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The company sold $550 million of 10-year bonds at a spread
of 200 basis points more than Treasuries and $250 million of 30-
year debt with a 212.5-basis-point spread, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms haven’t been
published.  Moody’s stripped Macy’s of its investment-grade credit
ranking in April 2009, citing a slowdown in  consumer spending 
and a “sizeable” debt load.  Performance ‘Sustainable’  The ratings company raised Macy’s to Baa3 from Ba1
yesterday, saying the chain’s “solid operating performance is
sustainable, as is our expectation for higher earnings going
forward,” according to a note from analysts Margaret Taylor and
Kendra Smith.  SABMiller’s sale is the largest since Feb. 4, 2010, when
Kraft Foods Inc. sold $9.5 billion of debt and  Warren Buffett ’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. issued $8 billion of bonds, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Valspar Corp. (VAL) , the producer of industrial paint, and the
Hong Kong-based conglomerate  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  also
marketed debt today as yields on investment-grade corporate debt
fell to 3.85 percent today, the lowest since Nov. 17, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  Corporate bond sales in the U.S. climbed to $7.45 billion
yesterday following $30.9 billion of issuance last week,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
