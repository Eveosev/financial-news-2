Yuan forwards advanced for a second
day as the central bank raised the currency’s daily reference
rate before U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  meets
Chinese officials.  Geithner arrives in Beijing today, seeking to narrow
differences on currency and trade disputes. The People’s Bank of
 China  lifted the fixing 0.1 percent to 6.3171 per dollar, the
first rise in four days.  Export growth  slowed to 13.4 percent in
December, from 13.8 percent in November, according to official
data released today. The  trade surplus  widened to $16.5 billion
in December, compared with $14.5 billion in November and the
median estimate of $8.8 billion in a Bloomberg survey, a
separate report showed today.  “China tends to allow a stronger  exchange rate  whenever
U.S. high-ranking officials visit, as a gesture that it’s
pushing for more flexibility,” said  Daniel Chan , an economist
at BWC Capital Markets in  Hong Kong . “However, a slowdown in
export growth will hurt China’s economy, making yuan
appreciation a less convincing story for investors.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.18 percent
to 6.3240 per dollar as of 4:54 p.m. in Hong Kong, at 0.1
percent discount to the spot rate in Shanghai.  The yuan closed at 6.3150 in Shanghai, little changed from
yesterday’s 6.3146, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent on
either side of the daily fixing. In Hong Kong’s offshore market,
the yuan slipped 0.03 percent to 6.3159.  Yuan in 2012  The yuan will strengthen this year at the slowest pace
since 2009 as shrinking growth curbs demand for the nation’s
assets and  Europe ’s debt crisis hurts exports, according to the
most-accurate forecasters.  The currency will gain 2.7 percent to 6.15 per dollar,
according to Andy Ji, a Singapore-based strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , whose estimates topped the
analysis of the last six quarters by Bloomberg Rankings. Second-
placed Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. forecasts a 3.5 percent
advance to 6.1. The onshore yuan rose 4.7 percent against the
dollar last year, the best performance among the 10 most-traded
Asian currencies excluding yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
