Former soccer star Eric Cantona is
writing to the mayors of  France  to collect the 500 signatures he
needs to present himself as a candidate in the French
Presidential elections, Le Figaro reported, citing Liberation.  He says in his letter that he wants to “carry a simple but
clear message,” one of “ truth and respect,” and of
“solidarity and strength,” according to Le Figaro.  Cantona, who has given his support to the Fondation Abbe
Pierre, wishes to “speak more seriously than usual, but also
with a keen sense of responsibility, at a time when our country
is facing difficult choices and deciding its future,” Le Figaro
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
