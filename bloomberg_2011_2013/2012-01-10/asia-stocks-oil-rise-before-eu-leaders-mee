Stocks (MXWD)  surged, sending the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level in five months, and
commodities rose for a third day amid speculation  China  may act
to spur growth. Treasuries fell and the dollar weakened.  The S&P 500 added 0.9 percent to close at 1,292.08 at 4
p.m. in New York, its highest level since July 29, and the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  increased 69.78 points, or 0.6 percent,
to 12,462.47. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  jumped 2.7 percent to
extend its biggest three-day advance in 15 months. The dollar
weakened against 15 of 16 major peers. Ten-year Treasury note
yields climbed one basis point to 1.97 percent. The S&P  GSCI (SPGSCI) 
gauge of 24 materials rose 0.9 percent as cocoa, silver and
copper rallied more than 3 percent to lead gains.  China’s  import  growth slowed to a two-year low in December,
government trade data showed today, fueling bets on monetary
easing. Laszlo Birinyi, whose prediction the  bull market  would
weather a five-month retreat came true in October, said U.S.
 stocks (MXWD)  will keep climbing in 2012 and Steve Leuthold, chief
executive officer and founder of the Leuthold Global Fund, said
he is bullish on U.S. stocks in the near future.  “China is likely to ease monetary and fiscal policies in
the first half of this year,” David Kelly, who helps oversee
$394 billion as chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in
New York, said in a telephone interview. “Their economy is
growing more slowly than it did. The  U.S. economy  seems to have
momentum. Most companies will surprise on the upside and markets
will react positively to that provided that there’s not any
further negative news coming from the rest of the world.”  Earnings Season  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum producer and first
company in the Dow to report results the latest period, had a
fourth-quarter loss excluding restructuring costs of 3 cents a
share, matching the average projection from 18 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 6 percent to $5.99 billion,
topping the $5.7 billion estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The
company reported results yesterday after financial markets
closed. Its shares rallied as much as 4.5 percent today before
paring gains and closing up 0.2 percent at $9.44.  The  S&P 500  has finished the earnings season higher 75
percent of the time when Alcoa rises in the session after
reporting its results, according to a Bespoke Investment Group
study of 34 quarters going back to 2003. Companies in the  S&P
500  may report earnings grew 6 percent in the quarter from a
year earlier, the smallest quarterly gain since September 2009,
according to projections compiled by Bloomberg.  “The sentiment in the markets improved as the earnings
season kicked off,” said Anita Paluch, a senior sales trader at
Gekko Global Markets Ltd. in  London . That’s “shifting the
attention from the European troubles for a while.”  8% Gain Predicted  Commodity producers, industrial companies and financial
shares led gains in all 10 of the main  industries  in the S&P
500, climbing at least 1.3 percent. Caterpillar Inc., Bank of
America Corp. and United Technologies Corp gained at least 2.6
percent to lead the Dow higher. Tiffany & Co. tumbled 10 percent
after the second-largest luxury jewelry retailer reduced its
annual earnings forecast.  U.S. equities will advance at least 8 percent as improving
corporate profits force bears to capitulate, according to
Birinyi, who manages $400 million in Westport,  Connecticut .
Leuthold, who like Birinyi advised buying stocks as the S&P 500
approached a 12-year low in March 2009 before rebounding more
than 100 percent, said an improvement in momentum made him more
optimistic and he favors health-care and biotechnology stocks.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  added 1.8 percent as Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG paced gains in automakers.
Debenhams Plc, the U.K.’s second-largest department-store chain,
rallied 9 percent after reporting holiday sales that beat
analyst estimates. Larger rival Marks & Spencer Group Plc
climbed 3 percent as revenue increased.  Philips Slumps  Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA)  sank 4.7 percent. The world’s
biggest maker of light bulbs said fourth-quarter profit dropped
by about 45 percent, held back by sluggish demand for health-
care equipment in  Europe . Software AG,  Germany ’s second-largest
software maker, plunged 20 percent for the biggest drop in
almost a decade after earnings and sales missed analysts’
estimates.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  advanced 2 percent. The
Shanghai Composite Index climbed 6.4 percent in three days.
Benchmark gauges in  Brazil ,  Russia ,  India , Turkey,  South Korea 
and Taiwan climbed at least 1.2 percent today.  “Policy makers in Beijing are very much focused on
downside risks,” said Andrew Pease, a Sydney-based senior
investment strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell
Investment Group, which oversees $137.6 billion of assets. “It
would be a reasonable expectation that there’s a lot of monetary
easing to come in the first half of the year.”  Oil, Orange Juice  Oil in  New York  jumped 0.9 percent to $102.24 a barrel, the
first increase in four days, on renewed concern that Middle East
tensions will disrupt supplies. Copper advanced 2.8 percent.
Imports of the metal by China, the world’s biggest buyer of
copper, surged to a record. Aluminum climbed as much as 2.7
percent to $2,165 a metric ton in London.  Orange-juice futures rose the most in five years, jumping
the 20-cent exchange limit, or 11 percent, to $2.0775 a pound,
on speculation that citrus groves in Florida suffered more frost
damage than expected last week, with some forecasters predicting
more cold weather.  Cocoa Surges  Cocoa futures jumped 7.5 percent and rose 15 percent in two
days, the biggest two-day gain in almost 11 years, after a
nationwide strike spurred concerns that supplies will be
disrupted in  Nigeria , the world’s fourth-largest producer.  The euro appreciated 0.1 percent versus the yen. The dollar
weakened at least 0.7 percent versus the Australian dollar, New
Zealand dollar and Brazilian real.  Treasury three-year notes were little changed, yielding
0.36 percent, after the U.S. sold $32 billion of the securities
in the first of three auctions of notes and bonds this week
totaling $66 billion.  Among European bonds, Spanish 10-year yields retreated
eight basis points to 5.49 percent and rates on 10-year Italian
notes lost four basis points to 7.12 percent. German 10-year
yields rouse four basis points to 1.88 percent.  The yield on the Dutch 10-year bond rose three basis points
to 2.25 percent. The Netherlands sold 3.105 billion euros of
0.75 percent debt due April 2015 at an average yield of 0.853
percent in an auction today.  Austrian (GAGB10YR)  10-year yields declined seven basis points as the
government issued 1.32 billion euros of securities maturing in
September 2016 and April 2022, with the average yield on the
2022 debt at 3.322 percent, down from 3.528 percent in July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
