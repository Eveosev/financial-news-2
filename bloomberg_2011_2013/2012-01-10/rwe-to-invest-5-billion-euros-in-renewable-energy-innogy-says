RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-largest
utility, plans to invest about 5 billion euros ($6.4 billion) in
renewable-energy ventures in four years as the country exits
nuclear-power generation.  Projects include a 1 billion-euro offshore wind park in the
German North Sea, as well as biomass plants and wind farms in
the U.K. and Poland, Fritz Vahrenholt, chief executive officer
of RWE’s Innogy renewables unit, said today at RWE’s
headquarters in Essen. RWE plans to almost triple its wind-power
capacity in Poland to 300 megawatts by 2015, he said.  Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, is seeking to install
10,000 megawatts of sea-based  wind turbines  this decade as it
raises the share of renewables in the energy mix. EON AG, the
country’s largest utility, said last month it will invest 7
billion euros in  renewable-energy  projects in five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
