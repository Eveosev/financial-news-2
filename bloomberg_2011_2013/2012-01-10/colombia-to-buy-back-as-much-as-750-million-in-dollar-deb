(Corrects third paragraph to show size of sale hasn’t been
determined.)  Colombia  will use part of the funds
from today’s international bond sale to buy back as much as $750
million in external debt, according to an e-mailed statement
from the  Finance Ministry .  Colombia offered to buy back dollar debt maturing between
2013 and 2027 beginning tomorrow, according to the statement.  The country is selling bonds due in 2041 today, according
to a U.S. regulatory filing. The size of the offering hasn’t yet
been determined, according to a person familiar with the
transaction who declined to be identified because terms aren’t
set.  To contact the reporters on this story:
