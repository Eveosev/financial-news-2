     Jan. 10 (Bloomberg) --BorgWarner Inc., a maker of
turbochargers, rose the most in more than two years after
forecasting annual profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  BorgWarner advanced 7.9 percent to $72.25 at the close in
 New York , the biggest gain since April 2009.  BorgWarner, whose products help automakers improve fuel
economy by powering smaller engines, said in a statement today
that profit this year will be $5.35 to $5.65 a share. That tops
the $5.17 average estimate of 19 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  “Demand for our product technologies that improve fuel
economy, emissions and performance, continues to accelerate
around the globe,” Tim Manganello, BorgWarner’s chief executive
officer, said in the statement.  Profit last year was $4.35 to $4.45 a share, the company
said in the statement. BorgWarner, based in  Auburn Hills ,
 Michigan , hasn’t released full 2011 financial results.  Dana Holding Corp. (DAN) , a Maumee, Ohio-based maker of truck
axles and frames, rose the most in more than three months after
saying in a statement today that adjusted profit for 2012 will
be $1.95 to $2.05 a share. The average estimate of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.88.  Dana climbed 8 percent to $14.19, the biggest gain since
Oct. 4.  “These targets are aggressive but achievable, and backed
by aggressive but disciplined operating plans,” Roger Wood,
Dana’s CEO, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
