Chief executive officers in the U.S.
turned less pessimistic in the final three months of 2011 as
views on the economy and business outlook brightened, a survey
found.  The Conference Board’s measure of sentiment among company
chiefs rose to 49 in the fourth quarter from a reading of 42 in
the previous three months, the New York-based group said today
in a statement. Readings above 50 indicate more positive than
negative responses.  The executives’ expectations for the economy six months
from now rose to 51 from 45, and their outlooks for their own
industries increased to 50 from 48, the survey showed. Prices
will increase by an average of 1.8 percent in 2012, compared
with projections of 3.3 percent last year.  “CEO confidence remains rather subdued,”  Lynn Franco ,
director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, said
in a statement. “The bounce back in CEO Confidence in the final
months of 2011 was due primarily to an improved short-term
outlook.”  The survey was conducted from mid-November to mid-December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
