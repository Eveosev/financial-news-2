At a time when shipping companies
hauling commodities are still contending with the industry’s
worst-ever slump, Precious Shipping Pcl plans to almost triple
its fleet in a bet the crash in vessel prices is bottoming.  The company, the only one of 14 members of the Bloomberg
Dry Bulk Shipping Pureplay Index forecasted by analysts to report
higher profits in 2011 and 2012, will buy 21 new and 20
secondhand vessels, said Bangkok-based Managing Director Khalid Hashim. Precious Shipping has 25 carriers, mostly handysizes
holding up to 35,000 metric tons of cargo. Investors may profit
because its  shares (PSL)  will rise 12 percent to 18.44 baht (58 U.S.
cents) in 12 months, the average of 15 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Precious Shipping is increasing earnings because of its
contrarian strategy. When rivals  ordered (VESLHSOO)  a record number of new
handysizes in 2007 after rates almost doubled, the company sold
10 carriers. Prices of secondhand vessels plunged as much as 63
percent since then as capacity exceeded demand. While rates may
take at least another two years to rebound, ship prices are now
low enough for acquisitions, Hashim said.  “Once the market turns around, we’ll have a huge fleet
bought at very low prices,” said the 58-year-old executive, who
has worked in shipping for more than three decades. “We buy
ships at what we think is the right time at the right price.”  Handysize rates averaged $10,552 a day in 2011, 36 percent
less than a year earlier, according to the London-based  Baltic
Exchange , which publishes freight costs for more than 50
maritime routes. That was better than the 44 percent decline in
the average level of the Baltic Dry Index, a composite of
returns on handysizes and three other classes of vessels hauling
coal, iron ore and grain.  Operating Costs  Nineteen of Precious Shipping’s vessels are owned outright,
reducing their break-even rate, Hashim said. Its carriers have
an average daily operating cost of $4,650, with 74 percent of
capacity trading in the  spot market  and the remainder on longer-
term charters, he said. Forward freight agreements, handled by
brokers and used to bet on future transport costs, anticipate
average earnings of $7,967 this year and $8,388 in 2013, Baltic
Exchange data show.  The cost of a five-year-old handysize fell 25 percent to
$19 million in the first 11 months of 2011, according to the
latest data from London-based Simpson, Spence & Young Ltd., the
world’s second-largest shipbroker. Values averaged $39.6 million
in 2007, the data show. Each ship is about 650 feet long and as
much as 100 feet wide.  New Vessels  Precious Shipping sold another 25 vessels from 2009 through
2010, bringing a total profit from asset sales of about $80
million, Hashim said. It bought four secondhand carriers last
year and sold four of its 18 contracts for new vessels for an
average profit of $4 million each, he said. The contracts were
agreed on with a shipyard in 2007 and 2008.  The company will report a 37 percent gain in  net income (PSL)  to
1.50 billion baht for this year, according to the median of 15
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  STX Pan Ocean Co. (028670) , the
biggest member of the Bloomberg Dry Bulk Shipping Pureplay
Index, will report a net loss of $3.07 million and profit at D/S
Norden A/S, second-largest in the gauge, will drop 42 percent to
$57.6 million, the median of estimates shows.  There are no signs of a rebound yet. Handysize  rates (BHSATCR) 
dropped 3.1 percent to $8,062 so far this year on mounting
concern that growth is slowing. Global trade in goods and
services will expand 5.8 percent this year, down from 7.5
percent in 2011, the International Monetary Fund estimates.
About 90 percent of world trade moves by sea, the Round Table of
Shipping Associations estimates.  Iron Ore  Total demand for dry-bulk cargoes, which include  iron ore 
and grain, will advance 3 percent in 2012, slowing from 5
percent last year, according to London-based Clarkson Plc, the
world’s biggest shipbroker. Iron ore is the second-biggest
commodity cargo after crude oil.  Handysizes are missing out on strengthening demand for ore
from  China , the biggest  buyer (CIRIIQTL) , as importers favor larger
vessels. Rates for capesizes, hauling about 160,000 tons of
cargo, rallied 56 percent since the start of August as
handysizes declined 18 percent, Baltic Exchange data show.  Ten percent of handysizes are bound for China in the next
month, compared with 21 percent of capesizes, ship-tracking data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The country’s economy will grow 8.5
percent this year, more than four times the anticipated 2.1
percent expansion in the U.S., according to the median of as
many as 70 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Fleet Capacity  While capesizes may have beaten handysizes since August,
they’ve done  worse (BCAVRT)  so far in 2012, tumbling 47 percent to
$14,535 on the Baltic Exchange. Shipping rates are volatile,
with capesize costs moving 16 percent or more in each of the
past 22 months and doubling in three of them in terms of the
difference between monthly high and low levels.  Weaker fleet-capacity growth was one reason the smaller
vessels were less volatile. The number of handysizes rose 11
percent to 2,640 since the end of 2007 as the capesize fleet
expanded 58 percent to 1,186 ships, according to data from
Redhill, England-based IHS Fairplay.  The Bloomberg  Tanker Index (TANKER)  of the six largest U.S.-listed
owners plunged 55 percent in the past year, compared with an 8.7
percent decline in the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities.
The Lloyd’s List/Bloomberg Index of the 50 largest container
lines dropped 36 percent as the Bloomberg Dry Bulk Shipping
Pureplay Index fell 44 percent.  Shares (PSL)  of Precious Shipping beat all the vessel indexes,
retreating 11 percent. They will have a  dividend (PSL)  yield of almost
4.1 percent this year, compared with 3.2 percent for the
Bloomberg Dry Bulk Shipping Pureplay Index, analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The reason they were able to maintain their strength and
cash flow is they didn’t diversify and expand like crazy,” said
Youssef Abboud, a senior shipping analyst at Thanachart
Securities Pcl in Bangkok. “This is when you want to buy, when
you’re buying new vessels at secondhand prices. When things turn
around, the return on invested capital will skyrocket.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
