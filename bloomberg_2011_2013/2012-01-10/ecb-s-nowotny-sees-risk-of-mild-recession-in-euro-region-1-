European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said he sees the risk of a “mild
recession” in the  euro zone .  “This is a phase of insufficient growth,” Nowotny, who
heads  Austria ’s central bank, said in Vienna today at an event
marking the 10th anniversary of the introduction of euro notes
and coins. “For the total euro zone in 2012 it will be zero, if
we are lucky.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB has cut its  benchmark rate  to 1
percent, matching a record low, and flooded the banking system
with cash in an effort to keep credit flowing to the 17-nation
economy during the sovereign debt crisis. Policy makers next
convene on Jan. 12. All but six of 53 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey expect them to leave rates on hold.  The ECB on Dec. 8 cut its 2012 growth forecast to 0.3
percent from 1.3 percent.  “‘Mild recession’ is the buzzword,” Nowotny said, adding
that “recessions are never all that mild -- growth of minus 1
percent is an economic problem.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
