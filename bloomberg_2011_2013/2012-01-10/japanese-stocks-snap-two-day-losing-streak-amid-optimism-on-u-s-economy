     Jan. 10 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  rose, snapping a
two-day loss, after U.S. jobs data buoyed optimism the world’s
largest economy is weathering Europe’s debt crisis.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets 44 percent of its
sales in  North America , rose 1.4 percent.  Tokyo Electric  Co.
jumped 24 percent after a newspaper reported the government will
buy its stock, lifting optimism the utility will avoid delisting.
 Olympus Corp. (7733)  surged 20 percent after a report the scandal-hit
camera maker is likely to remain on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. led shipping lines downward after cargo
rates slid.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  added 0.4 percent to 8,422.26
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix Index gained 0.3
percent to 731.93, with about two stocks rising for each that
fell.  Japan ’s markets were closed yesterday for a public holiday.  “ Asia  and the U.S. are being hit less by  Europe  than
expected, which is positive for Japan’s stocks,” said Shintaro Takeuchi, portfolio investment group manager at Tokio Marine &
Nichido Fire Insurance Co., which oversees $113 billion in
assets. “U.S. economic data continue to be firm.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.5 percent
today. The gauge added 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday as
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas
Sarkozy  said they may complete euro-zone budgetary rules as
early as this month to help stem the debt crisis.  U.S. Economy  Japanese exporters rose as U.S. consumer credit in November
had its biggest rise since 2001 and unemployment fell to the
lowest in almost three years in December, government data showed.
Economists expect a report due on Jan. 12 to show retail sales
rose 0.3 percent last month, according to median estimates.  Honda rose 1.4 percent to 2,487 yen. Funai Electric Co., a
television maker that gets half it sales in the U.S., rose 3
percent to 1,922 yen.  Tokyo Electric (9501) , also known as Tepco, jumped after the
Nikkei newspaper said Japan’s government may buy the firm’s
common stock. The state-run Nuclear Damage Liability
Facilitation Fund aims to hold more than two-thirds of  voting
rights  in the utility as part of a planned 1 trillion yen ($13
billion) cash injection, the report said without saying where it
got the information. The stock soared 24 percent to 215 yen
after sliding as much as 12 percent.  The possible government purchase of the utility’s equity
will reassure investors, said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a strategist
at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  “It means it will avoid being delisted,” Nakanishi said.
“That’s creating a sense of safety and causing the stock to be
bought back. Tepco will go bankrupt without government’s
supervision.”  Olympus Jumps  Olympus soared 20 percent to 1,263 yen after the Nikkei
reported the company is likely to remain listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. The bourse is expected to make a final decision
this month, the report said, without citing anyone. The stock
earlier surged as much as 28 percent, the biggest advance since
at least September 1974.  Shipping companies fell the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of
shipping costs for commodities, fell 2.9 percent to its lowest
since Aug. 15. The gauge has lost a third of its value since Dec.
12.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , Japan’s second-biggest shipping
line by sales, dropped 7.5 percent to 261 yen.  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) ,
the sector leader, lost 4.7 percent to 183 yen.  Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  slid 3.8 percent to 128 yen.  China  Exports Slow  Stocks maintained gains even after data showed today that
China’s export growth slowed and imports rose less than
economists had expected. Gains were also limited after the euro
touched 97.28 yen yesterday, the lowest level since December
2000. A stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters because it erodes
the value of their overseas income.  Japanese stocks tumbled last year amid a surge in the yen,
natural disasters and nuclear meltdowns at Tokyo Electric’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi power plant. The Topix dropped 19 percent in
2011, the biggest yearly decline since 2008, exceeding an 11
percent decline on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, ground zero for
the region’s debt crisis.  The price of shares on the Topix is  valued  at 0.88 times
estimated book value, near the lowest since March 2009. A number
below one means investors can buy companies for less than the
value of their assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
