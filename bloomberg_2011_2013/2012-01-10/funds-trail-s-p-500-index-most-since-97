Equity mutual funds had their worst
year since 1997 relative to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as
record-high correlation and price swings made it harder for
money managers to pick stocks.  Among about 4,100 funds that invest in large-cap stocks, 17
percent beat the benchmark index for U.S. equities last year,
the least since the 12 percent recorded in 1997, based on data
from Chicago-based Morningstar Inc.  While the  S&P 500  finished 2011 virtually unchanged, the
year was marked by record high correlation and volatility amid
concern over surging sovereign debt in the U.S. and  Europe .
Funds performed worse than their benchmark gauges as stocks
moved in almost lockstep and managers failed to anticipate a
rally in utilities and household-product makers, according to
Bank of America Corp.  “The best way to keep pace with the S&P last year would
have been a strategy that rotated between sectors based on the
macro headlines,” David Spika, who helps oversee $12 billion as
an investment strategist at Westwood Holdings Group Inc. in
 Dallas , wrote in an e-mail today. “However, that’s historically
been a very difficult way to manage stock portfolios and flies
in the face of those of us who believe in bottom-up, fundamental
security selection.”  The S&P 500 rose 8.4 percent in 2011 through April to reach
a three-year high, then fell as much as 19 percent through Oct.
3 as Congress and President  Barack Obama  struggled over deficit
cuts and Europe was forced to bail out  Greece . The gauge then
trimmed the decline as U.S. manufacturing rebounded and the
 unemployment rate  dropped.  Stock Correlation  The 50-day correlation of S&P 500 stocks to gains or losses
in the full index increased to a record 0.86 in October,
according to data compiled by Westport, Connecticut-based
Birinyi Associates Inc. since 1980. A level of 1 would mean all
500 stocks moved together.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  alternated between gains
and losses of more than 400 points on four days for the first
time ever in August. Daily share swings in the S&P 500 averaged
2.2 percent that month, the most for any August since 1932,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The big challenge for stock pickers was the fact that
macro-economic events were the big drivers of stock prices,”
Spika said. “Company fundamentals, including earnings growth,
remained very solid, but were largely ignored because so much
fear was generated by the negative macro headlines.”  S&P 500 earnings have beaten analysts’ estimates for the
past 11 quarters and are  forecast  to climb above $100 a share in
2012, according to analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg.  While  utilities  and consumer staples were the only
industries with gains from the S&P 500’s peak in April through
yesterday, they were the groups most underweighted by fund
managers as of the third quarter, according to Bank of America.  “Fund managers were stymied in the second half by a
failure of stocks to differentiate from one another,” Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at
Bank of America, wrote in a note yesterday. “Sector positioning
likely also hurt active managers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
