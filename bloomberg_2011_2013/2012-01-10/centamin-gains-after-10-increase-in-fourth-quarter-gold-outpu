Centamin Plc (CEY) , a gold producer in
 Egypt , was the best-performing stock in London’s benchmark
mining index after fourth-quarter output at its Sukari project
rose 10 percent.  Centamin climbed 8.5 percent and to 87.75 pence by the
close in London, the biggest gain among the 24 members of the
 FTSE 350  Mining Index. Production in the three months ended Dec.
31 was 58,965 ounces and 202,968 ounces for the full year,
Centamin said in a statement today. The company targeted 2011
production of 200,000 ounces to 210,000 ounces.  Centamin plunged 53 percent last year as political
instability in Egypt deterred investors and supply interruptions
and blasting restrictions led the company to cut its initial
output target of 250,000 ounces to 290,000 ounces.  “The final quarter of 2011 saw Centamin deliver record
performance on all operating fronts, which was a credit to our
operating team who remained focused and committed to
successfully delivering on our targets during a challenging
year,” Chairman Josef El-Raghy said in the statement  To contact the reporter on this story:
