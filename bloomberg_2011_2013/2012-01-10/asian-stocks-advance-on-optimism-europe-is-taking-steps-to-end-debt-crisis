Asian  stocks  rose, with a regional
benchmark index climbing the most in a week, on stronger U.S.
and Australian economic reports and speculation that slowing
 China  trade boosts the case for easier monetary policy.  China Merchants Bank Co. led mainland lenders higher on
speculation the government will take action to stimulate the
economy amid slower exports.  James Hardie (JHX)  Industries SE, an
Australian supplier of building materials, climbed 3.1 percent

manufacturing growth from China to the U.S. bolstered confidence
in the global economy.  “There’s a sense of optimism that the  U.S. economy  has
turned the corner,” said Andrew Pease, Sydney-based senior
investment strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell
Investment Group, which oversees $137.6 billion. “Policy makers
in Beijing are very much focused on downside risks. It would be
a reasonable expectation that there’s a lot of monetary easing
to come in the first half of the year.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.9
percent. The gauge gained 0.2 percent in  New York  overnight as
investors awaited the start of the quarterly earnings season and

markets are going to move in the next few months.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 0.4 percent, resuming

percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index added 0.7 percent.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  jumped 2.7 percent,
positing its biggest three-day advance since October 2010, amid
speculation the People’s Bank of China will ease lending curbs
as Europe’s debt crisis cuts demand for exports. Overseas
 shipments  grew in December at the slowest pace in 10 months, the
government said today.  China, Australia  Chinese lenders and developers advanced. China Merchants

second-biggest maker of mobile phones by sales, added 1 percent

struggled to resolve its debt crisis. The S&P 500 Index broke
even for the year and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 11
percent. Stocks in the Asian gauge were valued at 12.1 times

meltdowns at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant.  Tepco Rebounds  Tepco, as the utility is known, surged 24 percent to 215
yen today, reversing earlier losses of as much as 12 percent,
after the Nikkei newspaper reported Japan’s government may take
a controlling stake in the company. The report may have
reassured investors, said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a strategist at
Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  “It means it will avoid being delisted,” he said.
“That’s creating a sense of safety and causing the stock to be
bought back. Tepco will go bankrupt without government
supervision.”  Olympus Corp. (7733)  surged 20 percent to 1,263 yen after the
Nikkei reported the scandal-hit camera maker will likely retain
its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and as the company took
legal action against executives over a $1.7 billion accounting
fraud.  “It’s looking much more likely Olympus will keep its
listing now,” said  Mitsuo Shimizu , an equity analyst at Cosmo
Securities Co. “By suing, the company is making it clear who
was responsible for hiding losses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
