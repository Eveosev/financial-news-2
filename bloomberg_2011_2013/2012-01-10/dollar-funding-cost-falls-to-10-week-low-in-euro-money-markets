The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined for a third day to the lowest in 10
weeks, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, fell to 95
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:21 a.m.
in  London , compared with minus 99 yesterday. That’s the lowest
cost since Oct. 31.  The one-year basis swap was at 84 basis points less than
Euribor, compared with minus 87 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  rose. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, rose to 93 basis
points from 92 yesterday. It widened to 101 basis points on Dec.
1, 2011, the biggest gap since January 2009.  Overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank  rose to a
record, as lenders parked 482 billion euros ($615 billion) with
the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, exceeding the previous high
of 464 billion euros on Jan 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
