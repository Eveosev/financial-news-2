Ghana ’s cedi weakened to the lowest
in almost 18 years against the dollar as traders bought the U.S.
currency to import goods and foreign investors sought to sell
their local investments.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.8 percent to 1.674 per dollar as of 2:10 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the lowest since at least May 1994, when Bloomberg began
compiling the data.  “Demand for dollars today came mostly from offshore
investors and buyers from the commerce industry,” Chris Nettey,
a currency trader at the local unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
said in a telephone interview. “The offshore investors sold
their investments in bonds and other instruments on the
secondary market, citing the possibility of a weaker cedi in an
election year.”  Ghana will hold presidential and parliamentary elections in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
