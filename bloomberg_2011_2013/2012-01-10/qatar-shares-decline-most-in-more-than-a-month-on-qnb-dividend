Qatar’s benchmark stock index
dropped the most in more than a month as investors were
disappointed with  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) ’s dividend plan.  Qatar National, the Gulf country’s biggest bank by assets,
headed for the biggest decline in almost a year.  Commercial Bank
of Qatar QSC (CBQK) , the nation’s second-biggest lender, decreased 1.2
percent. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  slumped 1.5 percent, the most since
Nov. 21, to 8,679.63, at 10:18 a.m. in Doha. The  Bloomberg GCC
200 Index (BGCC200)  slipped 0.2 percent.  “Apparently the dividend disappointed some investors,
which tells you how high expectations are in Qatar with regard
to dividend payouts, which have been historically very high,”
said Ahmed Talhaoui, the Abu Dhabi-based head of investment and
asset management at Royal Capital PJSC. The results were
otherwise “strong,” he said.  Qatar National yesterday said it would distribute a 40
percent cash dividend and bonus shares of 10 percent. Its  full-
year profit  rose 32 percent to 7.5 billion riyals ($2 billion)
as loans and advances increased, beating the mean  7.37 billion-
riyal estimate  of eight analysts, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The shares tumbled 4.2 percent, the most since Nov. 20, to
146.5 riyals. They are poised for the biggest decline since
February 2011.  Qatari lenders are benefiting from a pickup in lending as
the Persian Gulf country, host to the 2022 soccer World Cup,
invests in infrastructure and industrial projects. Qatar’s
economy may expand 19 percent in 2011, making it the fastest-
growing economy in the world, the Washington-based International
Monetary Fund said in a report in October.  Commercial Bank of Qatar, which may report results on Jan.
23, fell the most since Dec. 29 to 83.8 riyals.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 0.3 percent and Abu
Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  increased 0.2 percent. Oman’s  MSM 30
Index  rose 0.1 percent and Kuwait’s  gauge  advanced 0.2 percent.
Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  was unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
