What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after excessive heat and
dry weather during the past week caused irreversible damage to
crops in  Argentina , Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc., said in a telephone interview.
Rain forecast over the next three days may provide temporary
relieve to half the crop, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1 cent
higher on the CBOT on speculation that adverse weather in
Argentina is being offset by rain aiding crops in  Brazil , Grow
said. Slow Chinese demand for U.S. supplies also may pressure
soybeans. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open steady to 0.1
cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open steady to
50 cents lower per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that rain in the southern U.S.
Great Plains will aid crop development and boost yield potential
when the harvest starts in May, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
