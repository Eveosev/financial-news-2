Laszlo Birinyi, whose prediction the
 bull market  would weather a five-month retreat came true in
October when the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 11 percent,
says stocks will keep climbing in 2012.  Equities will gain at least 8 percent as improving
corporate profits force bears to capitulate, according to
Birinyi, who manages $400 million in Westport,  Connecticut .
Forecasts for declines from economists Gary Shilling and  Nouriel
Roubini  were repudiated in 2011 as the benchmark gauge for
American equities erased a 13 percent drop.  Birinyi, who advised holding stocks in August as the U.S.
government was stripped of its AAA credit rating and strategists
cut forecasts faster than any time since the credit crisis, said
shares will climb for years to come if history is any guide.
Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling & Co., predicts equity
investors will lose money in 2012 as  consumer spending  drops.  “Many concerns are opinions, but not necessarily facts,”
Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates Inc., said in a
telephone interview on Jan. 4. “Later in the year, things will
get a little bit better and sentiment will change, and we end up
at the last leg where we’ve got the last-guy-in-the-pool
scenario.”  Annual 28% Returns  The S&P 500 has  risen  89 percent since March 2009,
returning 28 percent a year to investors including dividends as
U.S. gross domestic product expanded at an average rate of 2.4
percent over nine quarters. After  ending 2011  virtually
unchanged, the index gained 1.6 percent to 1,277.81 last week,
the biggest rally to start a year since 2006. The  S&P 500 
advanced 0.9 percent to 1,292.08 today.  While U.S. stocks avoided a  bear market  in 2011, they
posted their biggest decline since 2008, falling 19.4 percent
between April and October. Investors outside the U.S. suffered
bigger losses, with the  Stoxx Europe 600  plunging 26 percent and
 China ’s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index tumbling about
30 percent. About $6 trillion was erased from global equity
values last year, the second annual decline since 2002.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a
gauge of investor concern derived from equity derivatives,
averaged  24.2 in 2011 , the third-highest level in the last nine
years behind 2008 and 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It
reached a 29-month high of 48 on Aug. 8. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  swung 400 points for four straight days for
the first time ever in August.  Strategists Cut  The average S&P 500 estimate from 13 Wall Street
strategists tracked by Bloomberg fell more than 9 percent from
May through November, the most since 2009. Their forecast for a
6.4 percent increase in 2012 at the start of this year was the
most conservative since 2005, Bloomberg data show.  “Even though we were basically flat, this was a really
volatile year,”  Peter Sorrentino , a senior  fund manager  at
Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, who helps oversee $14.5
billion, said in a Jan. 5 phone interview. “Negative sentiment
is what trapped the U.S. market and then we got range bound
because the fear that if Europe slips into a major recession, it
takes us with them.”  Birinyi, an equity trader at Salomon Brothers Inc. in the
1980s, was one of the first investors to recommend buying when
stocks bottomed in 2009. He stayed  bullish  through the S&P 500’s
decline of 16 percent in 2010 and last year’s tumble to 1,099.23
on Oct. 3 from 1,363.61 on April 29.  ‘We Were Uncomfortable’  “Quite frankly, when the market got down 19 percent, we
were uncomfortable,” he said in a Jan. 4 phone interview. “But
we were uncomfortable in 2010 when the market went down 15
percent, and it ended up recovering.”  U.S.  equities (SPX)  are in the third of four bull market stages,
in which investors accept the rally that gathered momentum in
the first two, according to Birinyi’s analysis. He said this
phase, which  started around July , should end in 2012 with a gain
of at least 8 percent. The bull market’s final phase of
“exuberance” has lifted the S&P 500 an average of 39 percent
in the five advances since 1962, he said.  S&P 500  earnings  have beaten estimates for the past 11
quarters and are  forecast  to climb above $100 a share in 2012,
according to analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg. A ratio
of  debt to assets  for S&P 500 companies reached its lowest point
since at least 2002 in the third quarter, Bloomberg data show.  Bulls Under Pressure  Bulls such as Birinyi came under pressure in the second
half of 2011 as the S&P 500 tumbled 5.7 percent in August and
7.2 percent in September. It lost 4.5 percent on Aug. 18 when
the  Federal Reserve  said factory production in the Philadelphia
region reached a 29-month low. The index lost more than 5
percent over two days twice before bottoming on Oct. 3, the
first time after the Fed cited risks to the economy on Sept. 21,
the second after consumer spending slowed on Sept. 30.  Stock swings increased as economists cut their forecast for
2012 GDP growth from 3.3 percent in February to 2 percent in
October. Roubini, the co-founder and chairman of Roubini Global
Economics LLC in  New York , put chances of a contraction in
developed economies at 60 percent and said investment gains
would prove temporary. The S&P 500 is up 4.5 percent since he
spoke Oct. 18 at an Asset Allocation Summit in  London . Roubini
declined to comment on his outlook.  Shilling said in September that equities were likely to
drop and that earnings would fall short of estimates. He
predicted in August that the U.S. would enter a recession this
year. While he missed the 17 percent rally that began Oct. 3,
he’s betting on a retreat as consumers save, the economy shrinks
and profits fall.  ‘Tough-Going’  “It’s probably tough-going for the equity markets this
year because the expectations are that economy is going to be
strong and corporate profits are going up,” Shilling, who
contributes to Bloomberg View, said in a Jan. 4 phone interview.
“I don’t think that’s realistic. I think we’ll probably have a
decline in earnings, which feeds off the forecast of a moderate
recession.”  Michael Shaoul  told clients of Marketfield Asset Management
on Sept. 14 and Sept. 23 to hold stocks because the decline
wouldn’t last. While investors were right to be wary of  Europe ’s
debt crisis, calls for a U.S. recession were unwarranted,
according to Shaoul, who helps oversee $1 billion in New York.  ‘Violent Market’  “This was a particularly violent market,” Shaoul said in
a Jan. 5 phone interview. “At some point in time those negative
things are going to matter a great deal, but not at this point
in the cycle. It still looks to me that the U.S. equity market
should be able to surpass that 2011 high.”  The S&P 500 has risen about 7.1 percent during the third
year of a bull market and the  price-earnings ratio  increases 6.3
percent, according to Bloomberg data dating back to 1960. The
index is trading at 13.5 times reported earnings, compared with
15.8 in February and about 18 percent below the 16.4 average
since 1954, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Alcoa Inc. was the first Dow company to report earnings for
the  last three months  of 2011 yesterday when the largest U.S.
aluminum producer posted its first quarterly loss in more than
two years. Fastenal Co. and eBay Inc. are among the companies
scheduled to report in the next 10 days that analysts forecast
will see an increase in earnings, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “What we can see is that companies are still in business,
balance sheets are good, earnings are still there and the
negative case continues to be somewhat sketchy,” Birinyi said.
“The potential for surprise does exist.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
