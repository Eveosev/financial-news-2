Canadian natural gas fell as warmer-
than-normal weather in the U.S. cut furnace use and demand for
imported fuels.  Alberta gas fell 1.7 percent. Weather Derivatives predicted
heating demand in  New York  will trail normal by 21 percent
through Jan. 17. Chicago’s high temperature tomorrow may be 47
degrees Fahrenheit (8 Celsius), 16 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc.  “We usually expect to see a little bit more cold weather
by now,” said Eric Bickel, a natural gas analyst with Summit
Energy Services in Louisville,  Kentucky . “We may see a build in
the storage surplus with all the above-normal temperatures.”  Alberta gas for February delivery fell 4.5 cents to C$2.665
a gigajoule ($2.49 per million British thermal units) at 3:30
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s  Alberta  system.  Natural gas for February delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  fell 7 cents to settle at $2.941 per million
Btu.  Gas for prompt delivery rose as forecasters predicted
Arctic air will descend on western Canada and the northern U.S.
Great Plains states next week. Temperatures as much as 15
degrees Fahrenheit below normal will sweep across Alberta,
Saskatchewan, Montana and North Dakota, according to Commodity
Weather Group LLC and MDA EarthSat Weather.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
11.41 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $3.1321 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can carry
1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas gained 6.75 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $3.0459,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was up 9.09 cents, or 3 percent, to
$3.1117.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 187 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.79 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 984 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.67 billion cubic feet today, or 63 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.92
billion cubic feet at 2:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
