Game Group Plc (GMG) , a U.K. electronic
games retailer, said Christmas-period sales fell below forecasts
because of challenging market conditions and promotional
activities by rivals.  The company recorded a 12.9 percent decline in like-for-
like sales in the eight weeks to Jan. 7. Full-year sales are now
expected to show a 10.3 percent drop, missing the Nov. 16
estimate of a 7 percent decline, Hampshire, England-based Game
Group said in a Regulatory News Service statement.  Full-year gross margins will be down 190 basis points,
rather than 150 basis points previously predicted, because of
supermarket promotional activity. Lenders remain supportive, the
company said. It will meet its loan covenants but may not meet
its Ebitda covenants when they are tested next month.  “Our industry had an incredibly tough 2011, and so did
we,” Ian Shepherd, chief executive officer, said in the
statement. “We remain the market leader and have a clear
strategy which will return the business to growth,” he said.
“We are adapting to the changing market and are well prepared
for the next hardware cycle.”  The shares have fallen 10 percent this year and fell 89.3
percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
