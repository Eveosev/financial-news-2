Even Construtora e Incorporadora SA 
gained after the Brazilian builder’s fourth-quarter sales rose 9
percent from a year ago.  Even climbed 2.2 percent to 6.52 reais in  Sao Paulo  after
earlier advancing as much as 4.2 percent. The benchmark Bovespa
index gained 1.2 percent.  The Sao Paulo-based company’s fourth-quarter sales totaled
447 million reais ($248 million), according to a regulatory
filing after the close of trading yesterday. That was 9 percent
more than the same period in 2010 and a 27 percent gain from the
prior quarter, Banco J. Safra SA analysts Paulo Renelli Neto and
Matheus Corradi wrote in a note to clients today.  The results “corroborate our positive view” on Even, said
the Safra analysts, who have an “outperform”  recommendation  on
the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
