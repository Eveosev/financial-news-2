Russiaâ€™s inflation rate fell last
year to the lowest annual total since the government lifted
price caps following the collapse of the  Soviet Union  two
decades ago.  Inflation was 6.1 percent in December from a year earlier,
down from 8.8 percent in 2010, the Federal Statistics Service in
Moscow said in an e-mailed statement today. That matched a
preliminary estimate the service provided on Dec. 30 and was
less than the 6.3 percent median forecast of nine economists in
a Bloomberg survey.  Consumer prices advanced 0.4 percent in December from a
month earlier, the service said.  Core inflation , which excludes
volatile costs such as energy, slowed to 0.4 percent from
November, bringing the full-year increase to 6.6 percent,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
