Colombia  sold $1.5 billion bonds due
2041, the Andean country’s first overseas offering since July,
to help finance the budget and fund a debt buyback.  The government sold the bonds to yield 4.96 percent, or
1.95 percentage points above U.S. Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The sale is a re-opening of securities
that Colombia first issued in October 2009. Today’s sale brings
the amount outstanding to $2.5 billion.  The sale will help finance the 2012 budget, Maria Catalina Escobar, the deputy director of the Finance Ministry’s Public
Credit department, said in a telephone interview. Colombia will
also use part of the proceeds to buy back as much as $750
million of foreign bonds, according to an e-mailed statement
from the  Finance Ministry . The government will repurchase debt
maturing between 2013 and 2027, according to the statement.  HSBC Holdings Plc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the
offering.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporters on this story:
