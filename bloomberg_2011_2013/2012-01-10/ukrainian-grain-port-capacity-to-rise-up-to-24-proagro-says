Ukraine is set to increase capacity
at its grain ports by as much as 24 percent after private
companies finish building terminals, ProAgro said.  Port capacity, now at 33 million metric tons a year, will
swell by 5 million to 8 million tons, the Kiev-based
agricultural researcher said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday.  The increase will take place over five to seven years,
according to ProAgro. Ukrainian ports will be able to store no
less than 2.5 million tons of grain at any time, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
