Ukraine’s refined sugar output was
2.3 million metric tons for this season through Dec. 29, 51
percent higher than a year earlier, according to
Ukrtsukor, the country’s association of sugar producers.  Refiners processed 17.3 million tons of sugar beet,
compared with 13 million a year earlier, Ukrtsukor said in an e-
mailed statement today. The season started Sept. 1. An estimated
75 plants refined sugar beet into sugar in 2011, the association
said. Three refiners are still operating, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
