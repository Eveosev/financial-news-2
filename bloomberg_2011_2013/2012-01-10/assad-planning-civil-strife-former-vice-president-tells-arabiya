Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is
preparing a “sectarian war” if the domestic situation develops
against him and international pressure increases, former Vice
President Abdel Halim Khaddam told Dubai-based news channel Al-
Arabiya.  Assad informed an unidentified Lebanese government minister
that he won’t make “any concessions” and if “the pressure on
him mounts, he will resort to igniting a sectarian war” in
 Syria , Al-Arabiya cited Khaddam, who broke with Assad in 2005,
as saying.  -- Editors: Jennifer M. Freedman, Karl Maier  To contact the reporter on this story:
