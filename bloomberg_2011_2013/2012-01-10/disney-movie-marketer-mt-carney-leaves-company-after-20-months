MT Carney, the advertising executive
hired to run  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s movie marketing, left the company
after 20 months to return to  New York .  “It is terribly hard to leave, but I have been constantly
torn between my kids and my job, and like all good Hollywood
movies, the kids have to win,” Carney said in a memo to staff
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Carney joined Disney as president of movie marketing in
April 2010 as part of a management shuffle by film-unit Chairman
Rich Ross. She oversaw marketing of hits including “The Help,”
“Cars 2” and “Pirates of the Caribbean,” and also
disappointments like “Secretariat” and “Mars Needs Moms.”  Before joining Disney, Carney founded a New York-based
advertising company, Naked NY, in 2006.  Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 0.4 percent to
$39.75 in New York. The shares were little changed last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
