Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  is looking
at “a range of options” for its unit in the  United Arab
Emirates  and declined to say whether it planned to sell it.  “We are considering a range of options for Lloyds TSB
 Middle East  and have engaged a number of external parties and
advisers to assist us in that process,” Lloyds said in an e-
mailed statement today. “We will not comment on market
speculation around this process or the options available to us
and will not comment further until it is concluded.”  Reuters reported on Jan. 9 that Lloyds is in talks to sell
its U.A.E. operations and that  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) 
would most probably be the buyer.  An official at ADCB, who didn’t want to be identified due
to company policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
