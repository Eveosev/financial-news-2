Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , a unit of  Societe
Generale SA (GLE) , and Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  led a rebound for
the Czech equity index from a three-week low after Fitch Ratings
said it’s unlikely to cut the credit rating for France in 2012.  The  PX (PX)  gauge rose 1.4 percent to 897.9 as of its 4:28 p.m.
close in Prague, snapping a 5.2 percent retreat in the previous
four sessions. Komercni jumped 3 percent, the most in a month,
to 3,245 koruna, while Erste added 2.5 percent to 320.6 koruna.
The two securities comprise 33 percent of the index.  Fitch will probably keep its AAA bond rating for France
through 2012,  David Riley , head of the company’s sovereign-debt
unit, said today. European shares increased after Alcoa Inc.’s
revenue beat analysts’ estimates while commodities gained on
speculation that China may act to spur economic growth.  “Komercni Banka is today being helped by Fitch’s statement
about a low probability of a rating downgrade for France” and
an “overall positive sentiment in European markets,” said
Marek Hatlapatka, an analyst at Cyrrus AS in Brno,  Czech
Republic , in response to e-mailed questions from Bloomberg News.  New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest coking-coal producer
in the Czech Republic, advanced 2.9 percent to 143.5 koruna, its
highest close in two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
