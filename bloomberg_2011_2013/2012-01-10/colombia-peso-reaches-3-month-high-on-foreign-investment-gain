Colombia’s peso rose to a three-
month high after a central bank report showed that foreign
investment surged to a record $14.8 billion last year, topping
President  Juan Manuel Santos ’s $13 billion estimate.  The peso jumped 1.1 percent to 1,860.9 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close of trade in Bogota, from 1,880.5 yesterday. The
currency reached 1,860.65 earlier, the strongest level since
Sept. 20. The peso has advanced 4.2 percent this year, the most
among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Foreign direct investment last year through Dec. 23, 2011,
reached $14.8 billion, with 82 percent destined for the oil and
mining industries, according to preliminary data on the central
bank website dated Jan. 6. Colombian markets were closed
yesterday for a holiday.  “Foreign investment last year was higher than expected and
much more than in 2010,” said Juan Camilo Santana, an analyst
at Bogota-based brokerage Profesionales de Bolsa. “It is
expected to continue growing this year, driven by the oil and
mining sectors.”  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.48
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.287 centavo to 119.941 centavos per peso.  Colombia plans to sell today about $1.5 billion of bonds
due 2041 in its first overseas offering since July, said Maria
Catalina Escobar, deputy director of the  Finance Ministry ’s
foreign financing department.  Colombia will use part of the funds from the sale to buy
back as much as $750 million in external debt, according to an
e-mailed statement from the Finance Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
