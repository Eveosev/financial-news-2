Steve Leuthold, chief executive
officer and founder of  Leuthold Global Fund (GLBLX) , said he is bullish
on U.S. stocks in the near future, and sees emerging and Asian
countries as “attractive” places to invest.  The investor said an improvement in momentum made him more
optimistic, and that he favors health-care and biotechnology
stocks. He said equities comprise 58 percent of his asset-
allocation fund holdings, and he may cut that level to 30
percent if he sees signs of market deterioration.  “On a shorter-term basis, we’ve become a little more
positive” on American equities, Leuthold said today in an
interview with Betty Liu on “In the Loop” on Bloomberg
Television. Still, he said, “valuations are about neutral.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has closed above its
average level over the past 200 days every session this year.
It’s trading at 13.6 times the past 12 months’ earnings, a 17
percent rise from its level at the gauge’s October lows, while
still below the 16.4 average since 1954, Bloomberg data show.
The benchmark measure for U.S. stocks advanced 0.9 percent today
to 1,292.08 today, the highest level since July 29.  Global stocks rallied today as  China ’s import growth fell
to a two-year low in December, bolstering forecasts for monetary
easing. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued at 10.9 times
the past year’s earnings, about 17 percent below the level for
the MSCI World Index of developed-market shares.  “The emerging countries and most of  Asia  is a very
attractive place to be,” Leuthold said.  The Leuthold Global Fund beat 33 percent of its rivals last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Leuthold, who bet on stocks before the  S&P 500  reached a
12-year low in March 2009, said in August that political
uncertainty had pushed U.S. stocks into a  bear market  and
estimated that the gauge may fall to 950 to 1,000. The measure
fell as low as 1,074.77 intraday on Oct. 4 before recovering to
end the year at 1,257.60.  To contact the reporters on this story:
