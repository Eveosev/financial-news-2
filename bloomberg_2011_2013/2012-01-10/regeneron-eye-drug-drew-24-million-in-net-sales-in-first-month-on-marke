Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN) 
increased as much as 16 percent after net sales for the
company’s Eylea drug used to treat a blindness-causing eye
disorder were more than four times what analysts estimated.  Regeneron rose 11 percent to $72.45 at 10:05 a.m. in  New
York , after climbing to $75.83 in the biggest intraday increase
since September. The drug, used to treat wet age-related macular
degeneration, produced $24 million to $25 million in sales from
Nov. 21 to Dec. 31, the Tarrytown, New York-based company said
yesterday. Regeneron said that 2012 sales from the medicine
would reach $140 million to $160 million.  Eylea competes with  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s Lucentis, the Basel,
Switzerland-based drugmaker’s fifth biggest-selling medicine at
1.46 billion Swiss francs ($1.4 billion) in 2010. More than
10,000 Eylea doses have been distributed to doctors, Len Schleifer, Regeneron’s chief executive officer, said in an
interview. The company said that included pent-up demand from
difficult-to-treat patients, Christopher J. Raymond, an analyst
at  Robert W. Baird  in Chicago, wrote in a note to investors.  “Backing out stocking, it’s still a big number,” Raymond
wrote. Raymond raised his rating on Regeneron to “outperform”
and increased his target price for the shares to $81.  Baird had estimated $2 million in Eylea sales, according to
the note.  Phil Nadeau , an analyst with Cowen & Co., had
estimated the drug would generate $5 million in the fourth
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
