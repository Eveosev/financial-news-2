Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the biggest maker
of Swiss watches, said this year will be a “major” challenge
after revenue reached a record in 2011.  Gross sales rose 22 percent on a constant-currency basis to
7.14 billion Swiss francs ($7.5 billion) last year, the Biel,
Switzerland-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Swatch saw a “positive start” to January and expects
“good results” for operating profit and net income in 2012,
according to the release. The maker of Omega and Breguet
timepieces is tapping growth in the Greater China region where
rising incomes are boosting demand for  luxury goods .  “The figure came in better than expected, although the
outlook appears cautious,” said Jon Cox, head of Swiss research
at Kepler Capital Markets in Zurich.  Growth last year was tempered by the strength of the franc,
which reduces the value of sales generated in other currencies.
The movement stripped 696 million francs, or about 11 percent,
from revenue.  Gross sales of watches and jewelry climbed 26 percent 6.31
billion francs, while revenue from the unit that makes
components and watch mechanisms rose 33 percent to 2.02 billion
francs. “Major production bottlenecks” remain even though the
company has expanded its production capacity, Swatch said.  Sales at the Swiss company’s electronics systems business
declined 16 percent to 336 million francs, hurt by the
currency’s strength, according to Swatch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
