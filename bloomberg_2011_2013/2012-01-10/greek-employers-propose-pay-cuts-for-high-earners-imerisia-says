Greek employers associations
proposed wage cuts for “highly paid” employees to bring down
labor costs,  Imerisia  reported.  Representatives of four associations, meeting in  Athens ,
proposed cutting high earners’ Christmas and Easter bonuses, as
well as a salary freeze until 2015, the Athens-based newspaper
reported, without saying how it got the information.  -- Editor: Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
