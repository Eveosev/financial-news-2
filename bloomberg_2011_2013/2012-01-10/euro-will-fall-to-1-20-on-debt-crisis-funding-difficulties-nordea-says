Investors should bet the euro will
weaken against the dollar as European governments struggle to
raise funds and leaders race to implement new budget rules,
according to Nordea Bank AB.  Strategists including Jonas Thulin in  Stockholm  advised
selling the 17-nation currency at $1.2779, and buying it back
after it has depreciated to $1.20. Investors should exit the
trade if the euro strengthens to $1.3820, they wrote.  “The question is not if you are bearish on the single
currency, but rather, are you bearish enough?” the strategist
wrote in a note sent to clients today.  The euro was little changed at $1.2769 at 7:03 a.m. in  New
York  after declining to $1.2666 yesterday, the weakest level
since September 2010. The shared currency last traded at $1.20
on June 10, 2010.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and International Monetary
Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  meet in Berlin today as
the region’s leaders endeavor to end the sovereign debt turmoil
now in its third year.  Merkel said yesterday euro-area officials may complete a
new budget rulebook by Jan. 30 and are considering accelerating
capital contributions to the region’s bailout fund.  The “most difficult part” of the recent deal to bolster
budget rules is implementation, the Nordea analysts wrote. Banks
face short-term funding difficulties and euro-region nations
have “vast redemption needs throughout the spring with
borrowing costs staying elevated,” they said.  The euro will strengthen to $1.30 by year-end, according to
a Bloomberg survey of financial analysts with the most recent
forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
