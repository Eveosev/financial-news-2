Peru  posted its first  trade  deficit
in 34 months as the U.S. and  Canada  cut purchases of the South
American country’s metal exports.  Peru had a $13 million trade deficit in November, compared
with surpluses of $611 million a year earlier and $680 million
in October, the country’s National Statistics Institute said
today in an e-mailed report.  Exports totaled $3.14 billion, 3.1 percent less than
November 2010. The country shipped less copper and gold, its top
exports, and gasoline sales declined, the agency said. Imports
rose 20 percent to $3.15 billion, led by cars, crude oil, mobile
phones and televisions.  The U.S. and Canada reduced demand for Peru’s gold while
purchases by China and  Switzerland  increased, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
