The New Republic’s owners are
weighing a sale of the money-losing magazine, according to a
person with knowledge of the situation.  The investors, which include TheStreet Inc. co-founder
Martin Peretz, Rothschild banker Laurence Grafstein and Pershing
Square Capital Management LP head  William Ackman , have hired
Blackstone Group LP to explore a sale, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the matter is private.  The New Republic, based in Washington, is published 20
times a year, and a possible sale would bring in less than $20
million, according to the person. The magazine, founded in 1914
to cover U.S. politics, foreign policy and culture, was once
home to journalists Michael Kinsley and Hendrik Hertzberg and is
currently edited by Richard Just.  The owners plan to reach out to companies such as News
Corp. and Bloomberg LP, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier
today. Bloomberg isn’t interested in buying the magazine, said
 Ty Trippet , a spokesman for the company. Mike Rancilio, the New
Republic’s publisher, and  Jack Horner , a spokesman for  News
Corp. (NWSA) , didn’t immediately respond to calls for comment.  Bloomberg LP is the parent of Bloomberg News and competes
with News Corp. units in providing financial news and
information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
