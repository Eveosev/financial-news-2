Portugal ’s economy will contract
more than previously forecast in 2012 as the government cuts
investment and consumer spending drops, the central bank said.  Gross domestic product  will fall 3.1 percent this year
after declining an estimated 1.6 percent in 2011, the Bank of
Portugal said today in its winter economic bulletin. In October,
the bank forecast GDP would fall 1.9 percent in 2011 and 2.2
percent in 2012. The economy will expand 0.3 percent in 2013,
when Portugal will post a current and capital account surplus,
the bank predicts.  “There is great uncertainty around these projections,
associated to the future evolution of financial tensions on a
global scale and in particular to the institutional response to
the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area,” the central bank
said in a statement in Lisbon.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and
raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($100
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal
followed Greece and Ireland in April in seeking a bailout and
now plans to return to bond markets in 2013.  The austerity measures are hurting an economy with  growth 
that has averaged less than 1 percent a year in the past decade,
one of  Europe ’s weakest rates.  The Portuguese economy will shrink 3 percent in 2012 and
may expand 1.1 percent in 2013, the European Commission forecast
on Nov. 10. It would be one of only two countries with declines
in GDP in 2012, the other being  Greece  with a 2.8 percent drop,
the commission said. The euro area is forecast to expand 0.5
percent in 2012.  ‘Downside’ Risks  The Bank of Portugal said today the risks to its economic
projections are “clearly on the downside,” citing the
possibility of slower global growth hurting exports and the
government adopting additional budget measures that may have an
impact on household incomes.  Portugal’s 2012 budget includes a plan to eliminate the
summer and Christmas salary payments for state workers earning
more than 1,100 euros a month.  Tax deductions  are being reduced
and the government increased the value-added  tax rate  on some
goods. Spending cuts in 2012 represent 4.4 percent of GDP,
including reductions on health-care spending, while revenue
increases represent 1.7 percent of GDP.  Budget Targets  The government aims to trim the  budget deficit  from 9.8
percent of GDP in 2010 to the EU ceiling of 3 percent in 2013.
Debt is forecast to peak at 106.8 percent of GDP in 2013 before
starting to decline, the government said on Aug. 31. Debt was
93.3 percent of GDP in 2010.  The central bank forecasts investment will drop 12.8
percent in 2012 and 1.8 percent next year, while private
consumption will decline 6 percent and 1.8 percent,
respectively. It projects inflation of 3.2 percent for this
year, after an increase in the value-added tax rates of some
goods, and of 1 percent in 2013.  Exports (PTTBEUEX)  will grow 4.1 percent in 2012 and 5.8 percent in
2013. Portugal’s current and capital account deficit will narrow
to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2012 from an estimated 6.8 percent in
2011. It’s forecast to post a current and capital account
surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2013, the Bank of Portugal
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
