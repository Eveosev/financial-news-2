Siguler Guff & Co. , a U.S. private-
equity firm that manages about $10 billion, raised $630 million
for a new fund that will invest in distressed real estate
assets, said James Corl, a managing director at the company.  The Siguler Guff Distressed Real Estate Opportunities Fund
will invest the capital with other fund managers and make direct
investments through joint ventures with real estate owners and
operators, Corl said in a telephone interview today.  The New York-based company plans to buy equity interests in
financially troubled real estate and acquire delinquent and
defaulted commercial-property loans at discounts as borrowers
face difficulty reworking debt coming due in the next few years.  An estimated $400 billion of real estate loans is scheduled
to mature this year and next, including debt bundled into
commercial mortgage-backed securities, unsecuritized mortgages,
bank loans and construction loans, Corl said.  “A majority of those loans are probably underwater,” Corl
said, referring to debt larger than the value of the real estate
backing it. “There’s going to be a significant need for equity
capital to come in and recapitalize those assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
