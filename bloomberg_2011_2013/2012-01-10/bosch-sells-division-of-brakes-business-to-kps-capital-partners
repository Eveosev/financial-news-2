Robert Bosch GmbH (RBOS) , the world’s
biggest car-parts supplier, agreed to sell its foundation brakes
unit to private equity fund KPS Capital Partners LP as the
German manufacturer seeks to concentrate on brakes electronics.  The deal should be completed early this year, subject to
antitrust approval, the companies said in an e-mailed statement
today. Stuttgart-based Bosch will keep its power brakes and
braking control systems units and  expand  its aftermarket
business, including production of brake pads and discs.  “It is a business which is based on hardware, and we will
concentrate on the brakes electronics units,” Achim Schneider,
a Bosch spokesman, said by telephone, declining to specify the
value of the deal. “Carmakers now prefer to integrate complete
brakes systems into vehicles themselves. This doesn’t mean they
don’t work with parts makers, but that the unit can now work
with providers of other components too.”  Bosch Foundation Brakes, based in Drancy,  France , had sales
of 850 million euros ($1.09 billion) in 2010 and has 5,200
employees. The unit’s North American operations were sold to
Tokyo-based Akebono Brake Industry in 2009. The Japanese company
started due diligence of the rest of the unit in 2010 as it
considered a further takeover bid.  KPS Capital Partners, which is based in  New York , has an
investment in bus-maker  Motor Coach Industries Inc.  as part of
its $2.7 billion of assets, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
