(Corrects GDP forecast in second paragraph.)  Europe needs a more “decisive”
move toward fiscal union and the European Central Bank’s balance
sheet should be expanded, said  Stephen King , chief economist at
HSBC Holdings Plc.  Gross domestic product in the euro zone will probably
contract 1 percent this year, King told reporters in Singapore
today. The fiscal positions in the developed world are poor, he
said. Growth in  China  and India will hold up “reasonably
well,” King said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
