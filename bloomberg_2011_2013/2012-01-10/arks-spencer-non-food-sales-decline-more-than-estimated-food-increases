Marks & Spencer Group Plc , the
U.K.’s largest clothing retailer, said non-food sales slumped
more than analysts estimated over Christmas and warned
profitability would be lower at the unit as it promoted more.  Revenue at U.K. stores open more than a year fell 1.8
percent excluding value-added tax in the general merchandise
division in the 13 weeks ended Dec. 31, the London-based company
said today in a  statement . That was more than the median
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a 0.5 percent
decline. U.K. food sales on the same basis rose 3 percent,
beating the 2 percent median estimate.  Marks & Spencer, with more than 700 stores in the U.K. and
21 million weekly shoppers, increased discounting over the
holiday with offers like 25 percent off knitwear. Gross margins
will be “lower” compared to earlier guidance, but will be off-
set by extra cost savings, the retailer said.  “Marks & Spencer performed well in a challenging trading
environment,” Chief Executive Officer  Marc Bolland  said in
today’s statement.  On Jan. 4,  Next Plc (NXT) , the U.K.’s second-largest clothing
retailer, said November and December sales had been
“disappointing” and warned of slack profit growth next year as
the euro-debt crisis and a credit squeeze restrict  consumer
spending .  M&S shares fell 0.7 percent to 308.5 pence in London
trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
