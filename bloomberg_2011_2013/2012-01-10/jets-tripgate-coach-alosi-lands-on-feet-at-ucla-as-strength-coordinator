Sal Alosi, who quit as a  New York 
Jets’ assistant after tripping an opposing player during a game
last season, was hired by UCLA to join new coach Jim Mora’s
staff.  Alosi was hired by the Bruins yesterday to be their
coordinator of strength and conditioning, the school said in a
statement on its  website .  He held the same position with the Jets before resigning in
January 2011, seven weeks after the so-called Tripgate episode
in which Alosi knocked down the Miami Dolphins’ Nolan Carroll as
the rookie cornerback ran along the New York sideline on punt
coverage. Alosi was fined $25,000 and indefinitely suspended.  After playing linebacker at Hofstra University from 1996 to
2000 and then joining the school’s coaching staff, Alosi became
the Jets’ strength and conditioning coach from 2002 to 2005 and
2007 to 2010. He was on Mora’s coaching staff with the  Atlanta
Falcons  in 2006.  Mora was hired on Dec. 10, replacing Rick Neuheisel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
