General Motors Co. (GM)  said it expects
to return to 50 percent ownership of its joint venture with
 Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIZ) . by buying an additional 1
percent in the “coming months.”  GM owns 49 percent of the partnership and has been
negotiating to boost the stake to get to 50 percent.  “We hope that will be resolved in the coming months,”
Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson told reporters at the
Detroit auto show. “I know it’s been to their board.”  The Detroit-based automaker, which transferred the 1
percent interest in 2009, holds a call option, said Tim Lee,
president of GM’s international operations, which include  China .
He spoke to reporters yesterday at the show.  “We intend to exercise that call option,” Lee said.
“We’re working on that with our partner. There have been
several steps in the approval process to get it done.”  “This is a non-issue,” he added.  GM shares rose 1.7 percent to $23.23 at 1:32 p.m. in New
York time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
