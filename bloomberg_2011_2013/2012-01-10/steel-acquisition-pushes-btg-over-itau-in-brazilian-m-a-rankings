Banco BTG Pactual SA’s advisory work
on a $2.5 billion steel-industry acquisition in the final weeks
of 2011 pushed the lender over Banco Itau BBA SA and into the
No. 1 spot among merger advisers in Brazil for the year.  BTG Pactual, based in Sao Paulo, advised on deals totaling
$39.1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Itau, which led
the rankings through early December, fell to second for the year
with $36.7 billion of transactions, while Rothschild, the top
adviser in 2010, dropped to sixth with $23.4 billion.  BTG Pactual, owned by billionaire  Andre Esteves , handled 47
M&A deals during 2011, including the purchase of a stake in
steel-producer  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA (USIM5)  by Ternium
SA and Confab Industrial SA. The transaction was announced at
the end of November and included in the rankings last month. The
bank also advised on the $648.3 million takeover of Brazilian
Finance & Real Estate SA by BTG Pactual and its Banco
Panamericano SA business, announced in December.  “We do have a robust pipeline,” said Guilherme Paes, the
head of  investment banking  at BTG Pactual. He said deal volume
could grow 20 percent to 30 percent this year if there are no
disruptions caused by  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Competition between BTG Pactual, Itau and international
financial institutions may intensify this year, as the number of
transactions increases and the size of individual deals
continues to decline. Brazilian M&A deals grew to 710 in 2011
from 555 in 2010 and volume fell to $99.9 billion from $161
billion. The average size declined to $237.9 million from $470.9
million, the data show.  ‘Quite Active’  “The M&A market was quite active in 2011, and despite the
current global macro uncertainties we expect activity to remain
sustained in 2012,” Jean-Marc Etlin, chief executive officer of
Itau BBA’s investment bank, said in an interview.  BTG was the seventh-largest M&A adviser in 2009 and fourth
in 2010 after the bank hired some of the most experienced
executives in the industry from Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group
AG, including head of M&A Marco Goncalves.  “Today we have the biggest execution team for M&A in
 Brazil , with six senior executives,” Goncalves said in an
interview, adding that he expects direct investments in Brazil
to continue from  Asia , especially  China ,  Japan  and Korea.  BTG Pactual advised the controlling shareholders of
Schincariol Participacoes e Representacoes SA, which in August
sold their 50.45 percent stake in the company to Japanese brewer
Kirin Holdings Co. for 3.95 billion reais, or about $2.5 billion
at the  exchange rate  when the deal was announced.  The price was about 21 times the company’s Ebita, or
earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, according to
BTG Pactual’s Paes.  “The clients are happy with our service, with the
valuation they get from us,” Paes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
