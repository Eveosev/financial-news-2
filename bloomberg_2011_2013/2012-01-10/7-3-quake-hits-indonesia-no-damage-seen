A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck
west of Sumatra,  Indonesia  shortly after midnight, causing
residents to flee their homes and prompting a brief tsunami
warning. No damage or injuries were immediately reported.  The temblor struck at 12:37 a.m. local time about 420
kilometers (260 miles) southwest of Banda Aceh at a depth of 29
kilometers, the  U.S. Geological Survey  said on its website.  “People panicked and ran out of their houses, and some
headed for the hills,” Satrio Happrobo, an operational staff
member at the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency’s
Banda Aceh office, said by phone. The provincial capital
sustained no damage to buildings and there were no reports of
injuries, he said. A local tsunami warning was lifted at 3 a.m.  Indonesia, a country of more than 17,000 islands, is prone
to earthquakes as it forms part the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of
volcanoes and fault lines surrounding the Pacific Basin.  A 7.5-magnitude temblor and resulting tsunami struck the
Kepulauan Mentawai region of Indonesia, about 240 kilometers
from Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra, on Oct. 25,
2010, leaving least 113 people dead and 150 others missing  A 7.6-magnitude earthquake in the same area in October 2009
left more than 1,000 people dead in Padang, many of whom were
buried in mudslides and the rubble of collapses buildings. Less
than a month earlier, a magnitude-7 temblor south of Java on
Sept. 2 left 82 people dead.  A tsunami generated by a magnitude-9.1 earthquake off
northern Sumatra in December 2004 left about 220,000 people dead
or missing in 12 countries around the  Indian Ocean .  A magnitude 7 earthquake carries about as much as energy as
199,000 tons of TNT, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
