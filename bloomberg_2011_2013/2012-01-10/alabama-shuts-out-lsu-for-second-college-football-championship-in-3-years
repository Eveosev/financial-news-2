The  University of Alabama  beat
 Louisiana State  21-0 in the Bowl Championship Series title game
to win college football’s national championship for the second
time in three years.  The BCS championship was the last of 35 postseason bowl
games and was played at the Superdome in New Orleans, about 80
miles southeast of LSU’s campus in  Baton Rouge , Louisiana. It
marked the first time in the 14-year history of the BCS that two
teams that faced each other during the regular season met in the
national title game.  The Crimson Tide got revenge for their lone loss of the
season, a 9-6 overtime defeat against their  Southeastern
Conference  rivals on Nov. 5 in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama .  It was also the first time the BCS title game was contested
by teams from the same league, guaranteeing the SEC a sixth
straight national champion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
