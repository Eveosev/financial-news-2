Symantec Corp. (SYMC) , a computer security
software maker, uses free diagnostic programs to fraudulently
induce customers to buy its products with claims their computers
are in danger, a consumer alleged in a lawsuit.  Washington state consumer James Gross said in his suit that
Symantec’s programs’ diagnosis invariably results in consumers
being told they need to purchase the company’s products to
address identified risks to their machines.  “The truth, however, is that the scareware does not
actually perform any meaningful evaluation of the user’s
computer system,” and the remedial software doesn’t function as
advertised, Gross alleged in a complaint filed today in  San
Jose , California by Chicago lawyer Jay Edelson.  The case, which seeks group, or class action, status on
behalf of all consumers who have bought Symantec’s PC Tools
Registry Mechanic, PC Tools Performance Toolkit and Norton
Utilities.  Accusing the company of fraudulent inducement, breach of
contract and violation of  California ’s unfair competition law,
Gross is also seeking unspecified money damages.  Symantec is based in  Mountain View , California. Lori Cross
and Cris Paden, spokesmen for the company, didn’t immediately
reply to voice mail messages seeking comment on the complaint.  The case is Gross v. Symantec Corp., 12-cv-154, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
