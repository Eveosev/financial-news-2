The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries can’t get involved in the dispute over
Western sanctions against  Iran , Venezuela’s oil minister Rafael Ramirez said.  The Middle East country, OPEC’s second biggest producer,
has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz in response to U.S.
and European sanctions aimed at reducing Iranian oil revenues.
The waterway carries 17 million barrels of crude a day,
according to the U.S. Energy Department, almost 20 percent of
global consumption.  “Any Iranian action in defense of their sovereignty is
Iran’s issue,” Ramirez told reporters in Caracas yesterday,
where Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  met his Venezuelan
counterpart,  Hugo Chavez . “OPEC can’t get involved in this
issue.”  The U.S. tightened economic sanctions against Iran over its
nuclear program on Dec. 31, and the European Union is weighing a
ban this month on purchases of Iranian crude.  An Iranian newspaper this week cited a senior commander of
the Revolutionary Guard Corps, Ali Ashraf Nouri, as saying the
country’s leadership has decided to prevent shipping through the
Strait if Iran’s “enemies block the export of our oil,”
according to the  Associated Press .  Venezuela (OPCRVENZ) , one of OPEC’s 12 member countries, pumped about
2.3 million barrels a day of oil in December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Iran produced 3.6 million barrels a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
