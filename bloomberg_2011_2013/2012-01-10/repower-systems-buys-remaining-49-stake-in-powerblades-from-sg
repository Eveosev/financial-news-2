Repower Systems SE has bought the
remaining 49 percent stake that it didnâ€™t own in joint venture
PowerBlades from its partner SGL Carbon Group.  The transaction, which is effective as of Dec. 31, 2011, is
subject to antitrust approval, SGL said today in a statement on
its website. PowerBlades, based in Bremerhaven,  Germany , was
founded as a joint venture for the production of rotor blades
for wind turbines, SGL said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
