Mark Carney , chairman of the
Financial Stability Board, said the institution may not appoint
a new vice chairman to replace Philipp Hildebrand, who resigned
yesterday.  Hildebrand’s appointment reflected the “unique set of
skills” that he possessed and “it does not immediately follow
there would be a replacement for that position,” Carney said in
Basel today. “That’s a decision that will be taken in the
fullness of time and in consultation with the G-20.”  Asked about a future appointment, he said his answer
“implies I might not have a new vice chairman.”  He also thanked Hildebrand for his “immense contribution
to management of the crisis and development of a suite of
financial reforms.”   “We respect” Hildebrand’s decision “and will move
forward from here,” Carney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
