MetLife Inc. (MET) , the insurer seeking to
limit federal oversight, will exit the business of originating
residential mortgages.  The insurer will have $90 million to $100 million in costs
tied to the departure in the next year, New York-based MetLife
said today in a statement.  MetLife said in October it was seeking a buyer for its
mortgage unit after announcing plans to sell deposit-gathering
operations. The company reached a deal last month to sell about
$7.5 billion of its bank’s deposits to General Electric Co. The
 Federal Reserve , which oversees MetLife because of its size and
banking operations, rejected the company’s proposal last year to
raise its dividend and resume share buybacks.  “We continue to move forward with our plans to cease being
a  bank holding company ,” Chief Executive Officer Steve
Kandarian said last month. “This is essential to ensure that
MetLife operates on a level playing field with other insurance
companies.”  MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, will continue to
service current home-loan clients and to offer reverse
mortgages, the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
