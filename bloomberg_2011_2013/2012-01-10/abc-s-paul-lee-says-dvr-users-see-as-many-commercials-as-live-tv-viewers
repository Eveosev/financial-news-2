Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC said people
watching television shows on video recorders sit through a
similar number of commercials as those watching live.  “Not as many people fast forward through the ads,” Paul Lee, president of ABC Entertainment, said today at a conference
for TV critics in Pasadena, California. “And people who watch
live get up to make a cup of coffee and miss some.”  ABC and other broadcast networks are paid for commercials
seen on DVRs for as many as three days after they first air, Lee
said. Nielsen Co. is able to measure how many people see a
commercial during the broadcast and how many view the ad on a
video recorder, he said.  The network is seeking to be paid for commercials seen as
many as seven days after they air, Lee said.  Disney, based in Burbank, California,  fell  0.3 percent to
$39.63 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
