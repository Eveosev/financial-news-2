Touradji Capital Management LP has
hired Peter Borish to replace Paul Touradji as the commodity
fund’s chief executive officer, according to a letter to
investors obtained by Bloomberg News.  The move will allow Touradji to focus on his role as chief
investment officer, he said in the letter, which was dated
today. Borish is a former head of research at Tudor Investment
Corp., the hedge fund founded by  Paul Tudor Jones .  Mark Friedman, the founder of hedge fund AM Investment
Partners, will join Touradji as director of trading and
operations, according to the letter.  Touradji said in a September letter to investors that he
planned to focus on trading, delegating much of the fund’s day-
to-day operations to others. Touradji Capital Management is
based in  New York .  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Touradji in New York, said he
had no immediate comment.  Editors: Dan Stets, Charlotte Porter  To contact the reporter on this story:
