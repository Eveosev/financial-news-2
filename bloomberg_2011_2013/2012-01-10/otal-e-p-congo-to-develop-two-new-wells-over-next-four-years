Total SA (FP) ’s Republic of Congo unit
plans to develop two new projects at the offshore Moho-Bilondo
block within four years to replace ageing wells, said Jacques
Azibert, managing director of Total E&P Congo.  The two projects may produce a combined 120,000 barrels of
crude per day and are expected to be in full production by 2016,
Azibert said in an e-mailed statement yesterday in Brazzaville,
the capital.  “They will replace some projects that are in decline,”
Azibert said.  Congo Republic is sub-Saharan  Africa ’s fourth biggest oil
producer, pumping 292,000 barrels per day of crude in 2010,
according to the  BP Statistical Review of World Energy . Total
E&P has a 53.5 percent interest in the Mobo-Bilondo license,
while  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Congolese unit holds 31.5 percent and the
Central African nation’s government 15 percent, according to
Total’s website.  Last year, Total E&P Congo produced about 183,000 barrels
of oil per day and output this year is expected to be at a
similar level, Azibert said.  Republic of Congo’s economy is recovering from a civil war
between 1997 and 1999 in which at least 10,000 people died and
800,000 civilians were displaced. The country earns more than
half its income from oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
