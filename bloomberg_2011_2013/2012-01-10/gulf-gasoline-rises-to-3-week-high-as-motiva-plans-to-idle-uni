Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened to
the highest level in more than three weeks as Motiva Enterprises
LLC plans to idle a crude unit Jan. 17 for work at its Port
Arthur refinery in Texas.  The 300,000-barrel-a-day plant has already shut a diesel
hydrotreater for repairs, according to two people with knowledge
of the operations.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  also shut a catalytic cracker and alkylation
unit at the Alliance refinery in Louisiana, Andy Lipow,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said in an e-
mail yesterday.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  narrowed 0.25 cent to 3.88 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:03
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Itâ€™s the smallest
gap since Dec. 16. Prompt delivery rose 1.99 cents to $2.7377 a
gallon.  Houston-based Motiva is a joint venture of Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and Saudi Arabian Oil Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
