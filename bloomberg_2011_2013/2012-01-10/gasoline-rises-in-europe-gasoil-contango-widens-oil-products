BP Plc bought  jet fuel  barges at
higher premiums in northwest  Europe . Diesel spreads were little
changed even as Litasco, OAO Lukoil’s trading arm, sold.  Gasoil on the ICE Futures Europe exchange surged as  Brent
crude  rose. Contracts of the front-month and second-month gasoil
were at parity after trading in contango yesterday.  Light Products  Gasoline (MOGEEURB)  for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded at $967 to $974 a metric ton, according to a
survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board and Platts pricing window. That’s the most since Oct. 17
and compares with deals yesterday at $957 to $968. The trades
are for Eurobob grade to which ethanol is added to make the
finished blend.  The fuel’s  premium  to Brent widened to $3.57 a barrel from
$3.38 yesterday, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
a crude and refined products broker in London.  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent widened 6 cents to $6.44 a
barrel, PVM data show.  Kuwait Petroleum International Ltd., a unit of Kuwait
Petroleum Corp., sold three naphtha cargoes of 26,000 tons each,
from its Milazzo plant in  Italy  for loading Jan. 8 to Jan. 10,
Jan. 15 to Jan. 17 and Jan. 23 to Jan. 25, a company official
said, declining to be identified because he’s not authorized to
speak on the matter. Two of the cargoes will be shipped to  Asia ,
while one will remain in the Mediterranean, he said.  Middle Distillates  BP purchased the jet fuel from Statoil ASA and Koch
Industries Inc. at premiums of $59 and $60 a ton to February
gasoil, according to the survey of the so-called Platts window,
which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. That compares with
yesterday’s deals at a $58 premium to January gasoil.  Diesel barges  traded at premiums of $20 and $21 a ton to
February gasoil, the survey showed. That compares with deals
yesterday at premiums of $21 to January futures. ConocoPhillips
was the biggest buyer.  Gasoil for January climbed 1.8 percent to $976.25 a ton at
4:57 p.m.  London  time on the ICE exchange. The more actively
traded contract for February increased 1.7 percent to $976.25,
moving the contracts to parity. Earlier today, the contango was
at $1.75, the most since the end of July.  Contango is a price structure to describe a situation where
later-dated deliveries are more expensive than nearer supplies.
The reverse is known as backwardation.  Gasoil’s  crack  rose to $17.19 a barrel from $16.83 at 4:30
p.m. yesterday, according to ICE data. That’s the highest spread
since Dec. 8. Front-month Brent advanced 1.2 percent to $113.77
a barrel on the ICE exchange.  Barges (HEATAAAA)  of heating oil traded at a premium of $1 a ton to
January futures, according to the survey of Platts. That
