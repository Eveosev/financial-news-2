Apax Partners LLP hired six banks to
arrange more than 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) of
leveraged financing for its buyout of  France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s Orange
Switzerland mobile-phone unit, according to two people with
knowledge of the deal.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG are arranging
the funding, which will be made up of loans and bonds, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the deal is
private.  Ben Harding , a spokesman for Apax in  London , wouldn’t
comment on the arrangements.  Apax agreed to buy Orange Switzerland for 1.6 billion euros
($2 billion), France Telecom said in a statement on Dec. 23.  The deal values Orange Switzerland, which had revenue of
1.3 billion Swiss francs last year, at 6.5 times its estimated
2011 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, according to  France Telecom . That compares with a
median Ebitda multiple of 5.6 paid for Western European
telecommunications assets in the last three years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
