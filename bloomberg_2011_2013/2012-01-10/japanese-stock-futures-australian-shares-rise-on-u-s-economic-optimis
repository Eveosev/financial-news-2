Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities rose as optimism about the  U.S. economy 
overshadowed  Fitch Ratings ’ warning it may downgrade Italy’s
credit rating.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s biggest carmaker by market value, rose 0.5 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , a
Japanese trading company, gained 0.7 percent after oil and
commodity prices advanced. BHP Billiton Ltd., the largest global
miner, advanced 1.8 percent in Sydney.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 8,440 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,420 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,450 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200  Index (CRY)  added 0.5
percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.3 percent in
Wellington.  “There are more positive signs particularly on employment
and consumer” spending in the U.S., saidStephen Halmarick,
Sydney-based head of investment markets research at Colonial
First State Global Asset Management, which oversees about $150
billion. “The outlook in the U.S. is for modest growth this
year, and that’s better than Europe. Expectations are Europe
will be in a recession.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.1 percent
today. The index rose 0.9 percent in New York yesterday to the
highest level since July 29, a week before the U.S. was stripped
of its AAA  credit rating  by S&P.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. employers took on 4.15 million workers in November,
107,000 more than in the prior month, the Labor Department said
yesterday. The number of jobs filled in the three months to
November was the highest since the period from March to May
2010. Economists expect a report due tomorrow will show retail
sales rose 0.3 percent last month, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Italy faces a “significant chance” of a credit-rating
downgrade by Fitch Ratings, which is reviewing all European
sovereign ratings and will make a decision by the end of the
month.  “Taking out the crisis premium means a credible
firewall,”  David Riley , head of the sovereign-debt unit at
Fitch, said at a conference yesterday in London. “At the
moment, we don’t have that, and that’s a serious concern with
respect to Italy,” he said. Speaking on the sidelines of the
conference, Riley also said France will probably retain its
credit rating unless the European debt crisis worsens.  Chinese Stocks  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 2.7 percent increase by the
 S&P 500  and a 2.6 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. rose for a second day,
led by Internet companies, on prospects the Asian nation will
take further measures to spur expansion after import growth fell
to a two-year low.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index advanced 1.1 percent to a
one-month high of 100.81 as trading closed in New York.  Crude for February delivery climbed 93 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $102.24 a barrel on the  New York
