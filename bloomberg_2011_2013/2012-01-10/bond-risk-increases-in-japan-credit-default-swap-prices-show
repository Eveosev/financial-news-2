The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment increased in  Japan , according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan (ITRXAJE)  index advanced 1 basis point to 196
basis points as of 9.15 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG. The gauge is on track for its highest close since Dec.
1, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia (ITRXAAE)  index fell 0.5 basis points to
183.25 as of 11:15 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. At those levels the index has risen 2.75 basis points this
year, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia (ITRXAGE)  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 209 basis points
as of 8:47 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Deutsche Bank prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
