Colombia’s peso rose to a two-month
high after a central bank report showed that foreign investment
surged to a record $14.8 billion last year, topping President
 Juan Manuel Santos ’s $13 billion estimate.  The peso jumped 0.9 percent to 1,864 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:24 a.m. in Bogota, from 1,880.5 yesterday. It earlier touched
1,862.50, the strongest level since Oct. 28. The currency has
strengthened 4 percent so far this year.  Foreign direct investment through Dec. 23, 2011 reached
$14.8 billion, with 82 percent in oil and mining, according to
preliminary statistics on the central bank website dated Jan. 6.
Colombian markets were closed yesterday for a holiday. Santos
said last month he expected investment to hit $13 billion in
2011.  “Foreign investment last year was higher than expected and
much more than in 2010,” said Juan Camilo Santana, analyst at
Bogota-based brokerage Profesionales de Bolsa. “It is expected
to continue growing this year driven by the oil and mining
sectors.”  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.495
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.260 centavo to 119.823 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
