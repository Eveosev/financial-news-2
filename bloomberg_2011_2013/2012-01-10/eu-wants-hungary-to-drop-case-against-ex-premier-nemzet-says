The European Union wants  Hungary  to
drop a legal case against former Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany and to modify the new constitutionâ€™s clause on
marriage in exchange for financial aid,  Magyar Nemzet  said,
citing unidentified people in Brussels.  Gyurcsany is facing charges for abuse of power related to a
real estate transaction to set up a casino, the Budapest-based
daily said.  The EU also wants the government to change a passage in the
constitution, which came into effect on Jan. 1, which describes
marriage as a union between a man and a woman, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
