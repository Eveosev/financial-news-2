The  Federal Reserve  will pay $76.9
billion to the  U.S. Treasury  as part of an annual dividend it
remits after covering its own expenses from interest on its
ballooning bond portfolio and other gains.  Total assets on the Fed’s  balance sheet  stood at a near-
record $2.92 trillion on Jan. 4. The central bank expanded its
portfolio by purchasing $2.3 trillion in U.S. Treasury debt,
mortgage-backed securities and housing agency debt to push down
longer-term  interest rates  once its benchmark lending rate hit
zero in December 2008. The Fed expanded its portfolio in two
rounds of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing.  Because the Fed funds itself by emitting currency on which
it pays no interest, or by paying 0.25 percent on the deposits
banks keep at the Fed, the central bank enjoys positive interest
income. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 1.97 percent
at 11:27 a.m. today in  New York .  The bigger the Fed’s balance sheet, the more interest
income it generates. This year’s dividend to the Treasury will
be the second largest after 2010’s $79.3 billion. By comparison,
the Fed paid $29.1 billion to the Treasury in 2006, when total
assets on its balance sheet stood at $874 billion at the end of
that year. The Fed’s balance sheet rose to a record $2.928
trillion on Dec. 28.  Last year, Federal Reserve’s 12 regional banks had $83.6
billion in interest income on securities held in their
portfolios. An additional $2.3 billion was earned on sales of
U.S. Treasury securities; the Fed reported $152 million in gains
from foreign currency and income for services of $479 million.
The reserve banks paid $3.8 billion in interest expenses on
deposits held at the Fed.  Operating Expenses  The Fed said the reserve banks had operating expenses of
$3.4 billion last year. The Fed was also assessed $1.1 billion
for the cost of new currency and the expenses of the Federal
Reserve Board in  Washington , which does not generate interest
income because it doesn’t operate as a reserve bank. Board
expenses totaled about $470 million, according to a Fed official
who spoke on a conference call with reporters.  Some $242 million of the income was also used to fund the
operations of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and
$40 million funded the Office of Financial Research, two new
units created by the Dodd-Frank legislation overhauling
financial regulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
