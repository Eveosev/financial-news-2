Manroland AG (MRDCF)  will receive 24 million
euros ($31 million) from owners  Allianz SE (ALV)  and  MAN SE (MAN)  to finance
job cuts,  Handelsblatt  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The insolvent printing-press maker’s offset unit in
Offenbach,  Germany , won three orders from China valued at a
“low two-digit-million amount,” the German newspaper also
said, citing the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
