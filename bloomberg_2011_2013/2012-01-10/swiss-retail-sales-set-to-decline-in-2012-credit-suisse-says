Swiss retail sales  will probably
decline this year as a strengthening of the franc spurs
consumers to shop in other countries and as retail prices fall,
according to  Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   Nominal sales will show a “slight decline” in 2012,
though high levels of immigration should continue to lend some
support, the bank’s economists said today in an e-mailed
statement. Stripping out the effect of inflation, retail sales
should show “moderate” growth, the bank said.  “As long as uncertainty about the outcome of the euro
crisis persists and unemployment climbs, retail sales
performance will be held back by poor consumer sentiment,”
Credit Suisse said.  Swiss shoppers spent 4 billion francs ($4.2 billion) to
5 billion francs in other countries last year, according to the
bank. A survey conducted by researcher Fuhrer & Hotz found that
 Switzerland ’s retailers are less optimistic than a year ago,
with 38 percent of 200 participants expecting sales to stagnate
or fall in 2012, Credit Suisse said. Half of the companies think
the  Swiss National Bank ’s exchange-rate ceiling of 1.20 francs
versus the euro is too low.  Nominal retail sales in the country declined 1.8 percent in
November from a year earlier, the Swiss Statistics Office said
yesterday. Adjusted for inflation, sales rose 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
