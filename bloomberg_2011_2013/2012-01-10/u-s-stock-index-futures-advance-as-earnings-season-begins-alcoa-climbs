U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its highest level since July,
amid bets that China may act to spur economic growth.  All 10 groups in the S&P 500 advanced as financial,
commodity and industrial shares had the  biggest gains .  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  rallied at least 2.9 percent.
 Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the first company in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average (INDU)  to report quarterly results, pared a rally of as much as
4.5 percent.  Tiffany (TIF)  & Co. tumbled 10 percent after the luxury
jewelry retailer reduced its annual earnings forecast.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.9 percent to 1,292.08 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time. The index rose to the highest level since July 29, a
week before the U.S. was stripped of its AAA credit rating by
S&P. The Dow gained 69.78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,462.47.
The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  of small companies jumped 1.5 percent,
rallying above its average price of the last  200 days .  “Earnings don’t have to knock the ball out of the park to
push equities higher,”  Jack Ablin , who helps oversee $55
billion as chief investment officer for Chicago-based Harris
Private Bank, said in a telephone interview. “Expectations are
low.” On the international front, “there’s a growing sense
that  China  will ease policy and, to the extent that  Europe  can
muddle, it’s probably net positive news.”  Stocks rose as a drop in China’s import growth bolstered
forecasts for monetary easing. Equities pared gains as Alcoa,
the largest U.S. aluminum producer, tumbled from today’s peak.
The S&P 500 has ended the earnings season higher 75 percent of
the time when Alcoa rises in the session after reporting its
results, according to a Bespoke Investment Group study of 34
quarters going back to 2003.  Alcoa’s Results  Alcoa added 0.2 percent to $9.44. Sales rose 6 percent to
$5.99 billion, beating estimates by 5.1 percent. It had a loss
excluding restructuring costs of 3 cents a share, matching the
average projection from 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Aluminum jumped, pacing gains in commodities, after the company
also forecast a global production deficit.  The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)  of companies most-
dependent on economic growth gained 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones
Transportation Average added 1.4 percent. The KBW Bank Index
rallied 1.9 percent. Bank of America climbed 5.7 percent, the
biggest gain in the Dow, to $6.63. Caterpillar, the world’s
largest construction and mining-equipment maker, increased 3
percent to $99.96.  BorgWarner Inc. (BWA)  rose the most in the S&P 500, soaring 12
percent to $72.25. The maker of turbochargers  forecast  annual
profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  ‘Momentum’  “Most companies will surprise on the upside and markets
will react positively to that provided that there’s not any
further negative news coming from the rest of the world,” David Kelly, who helps oversee $394 billion as chief market strategist
for JPMorgan Funds in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“The  U.S. economy  seems to have momentum.”  The S&P 500 has jumped 18 percent from its 2011 low amid
better-than-expected economic data. The rally has brought the
index to the top of the trading range it has be stuck in since
August.  Eastman Kodak Co. (EK)  gained the most in the  Russell 2000 ,
advancing 50 percent to 60 cents. The unprofitable 131-year-old
imaging company simplified its management structure and created
a chief operating office to reduce costs.  Tiffany slumped 10 percent to $59.94. The company, which
generates almost half of its sales outside of the U.S., is
selling fewer $65,000 diamond necklaces as volatile stock
markets prompt European consumers to curb spending. Asian
shoppers also are restraining purchases of luxury goods.  Soft Demand  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  tumbled 8.3 percent to $14.01.
The largest U.S. tiremaker said it’s experiencing softness in
global demand. Sales of replacement tires in  North America ,
where Goodyear got 44 percent of its revenue in 2010, fell about
3 percent in last year’s final quarter, Chief Financial Officer
Darren Wells said at an investor conference today in Detroit.  Liz Claiborne Inc. (LIZ)  tumbled 13 percent, the biggest drop
since Aug. 8, to $8.64. The apparel maker cut its profit
forecast for the coming year and said its chief financial
officer is departing.  Rallying  stocks  have done little to entice professional
money managers back to U.S. equities. A gauge of hedge-fund
bullishness measuring the proportion of bets that shares will
rise climbed to 44.5 last week from 43.9 at the end of 2011,
holding close to the lowest level since 2009, according to
International Strategy & Investment Group. Compared with the
price of the S&P 500, managers’ so-called net exposure is close
to the lowest since June 2008, the data show.  Cutting Equities  Speculators have been cutting equities since the index
peaked in February 2011 at 54.2, concerned Europe’s credit
crisis will spread and curb global economic growth. They stayed
bearish after October when the  S&P 500  began a 17 percent rally
that has restored $2 trillion to the value of American equities.  Investors have struggled to profit amid record stock market
volatility. Hedge funds, largely unregulated investment vehicles
that aim to make money whether markets rise or fall, lost 4.9
percent last year as fear that the European sovereign-debt
crisis would spread deterred them from buying risky assets
including stocks, according to the Bloomberg aggregate hedge-
fund  index .  “Hedge funds have made massive mistakes,”  George Feiger ,
chief executive officer of Contango Capital Advisors Inc., the
San Francisco-based wealth management arm of Zions
Bancorporation, said in a telephone interview on Jan. 6. He
manages $3.3 billion at Contango and Western National Trust Co.

the least.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
