South  Korea ’s unemployment rate held
at a three-year low last month as jobs in the health and welfare
service sectors added to hiring by wholesale and retail
companies.  The  jobless rate  was at 3.1 percent in December, unchanged
from November, Statistics Korea said today in Gwacheon, south of
Seoul. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 12
economists was for a rate of 3.2 percent. The number of employed
people increased by 441,000 to 24.1 million last month from a
year earlier after adding 479,000 in November.  South Korea ’s service industries have hired workers,
helping to offset the effect of slowing export growth on the job
market. Concern over the global economy and cooling domestic
output may compel the  Bank of Korea  to refrain from raising
 interest rates  this week, according to all 14 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “We expect the labor market slowed marginally in
December,” Oh Suk Tae, an economist at SC First Bank Korea Ltd.
in Seoul, said before the release. “The deteriorating global
economic outlook and the continuing slowdown in activity lower
the chance of a rate hike.”  The won rose 0.6 percent to close 1,156.69 per dollar in
Seoul yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
benchmark Kospi stock index gained 1.5 percent.  South Korea’s inflation exceeded the central bank’s target,
with consumer prices rising 4.2 percent from a year earlier,
Statistics Korea said in a Dec. 30 report. Industrial production
unexpectedly fell in November for a second straight month,
according to a separate government report.  “A rate cut also looks unlikely at this junction, given
still-elevated inflation,” Oh said.  New Year Hiring  South Korean conglomerate  SK Group  said on Jan. 5 it would
more than double investment to 19 trillion won ($16.5 billion)
this year from 2011 and hire 7,000 more workers. Retailer
Shinsegae group announced this week a plan to recruit 8,000
workers in 2012, up 21 percent from a year ago.  The central bank projected last month that new jobs will
decline to 280,000 this year from 400,000 last year, with
jobless rate at 3.4 percent. The bank cut its growth forecast
for this year to 3.7 percent from 4.6 percent estimated in July,
compared with a 3.8 percent gain last year.  The seasonally unadjusted jobless rate was at 3.0 percent
in December, compared with 2.9 percent in November, today’s
report showed.  Employment in manufacturing fell 2.1 percent from a year
earlier, while the number of people self-employed or working in
the public-service sector increased 2.8 percent.  The number employed in the electricity, transportation,
telecommunication and finance sectors rose 5.1 percent, while
jobs in construction gained 6.1 percent.  Wholesalers and retailers added 109,000 jobs while the
health and welfare service sector added 90,000 jobs in December
from a year ago, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
