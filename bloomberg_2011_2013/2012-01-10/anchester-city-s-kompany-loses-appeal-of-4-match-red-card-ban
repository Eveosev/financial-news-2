Manchester City defenderVincent Kompany will serve a four-match ban after losing an appeal of a
red card received in a F.A. Cup game two days ago.  Kompany was dismissed after 12 minutes of City’s 3-2 home
loss to Manchester United for a two-footed challenge on Nani. He
protested that he won the ball.  Kompany received a three-match ban for a straight red card,
plus an extra game because it was his second dismissal of the
season,  England ’s  Football Association  said in a statement on
its website.  City’s captain will now miss both legs of the Carling Cup
semifinal against Liverpool, along with Premier League matches
against Wigan and Tottenham.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
