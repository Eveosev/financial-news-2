A general strike by the two main
trade unions in  Nigeria , the largest African oil producer, has
had no effect on vessels waiting at local ports, GAC Nigeria
said.  “There’s no impact on the ports at the moment,” Richard
Mallen, general manager, liner, at the provider of shipping
services, said by phone today. “Queues at the container and the
break-bulk terminals are normal.”  Break-bulk cargoes are loaded onto ships one piece at a
time, rather than handled in containers or pumped on board
vessels.  The unions began the strike yesterday seeking the
restoration of fuel subsidies scrapped on Jan. 1 by the West
African country’s government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
