Palm oil  production declines in
 Malaysia , the world’s second-biggest grower, outpaced the drop
in exports in December, indicating inventories may have fallen
for the third month in a row, Oil World said.  Exports of palm, the world’s most-used cooking oil, from
Malaysia fell by about 3 percent while production dropped as
much as 10 percent, the Hamburg-based researcher said today in a
report. Palm oil futures gained 9.3 percent in the last quarter
of 2011 on speculation that inventories would decline and
unusually high volumes of rain may hurt yields in Malaysia.  Declining stockpiles “supported palm oil prices in recent
weeks, coinciding with fears that excessive rainfall may magnify
the seasonal decline of palm oil production in Malaysia in the
near term,” Oil World said.  Malaysia exported 1.49 million metric tons of palm oil in
December versus 1.66 million tons in November and 1.29 million
tons in December 2010, Oil World said, citing cargo surveyor
SGS. China was the leading destination last month, importing
337,000 tons, Oil World data show. The European Union imported
296,000 tons and  Pakistan  took in 167,000 tons, the researcher
said.  Rainfall in November was about 15 percent above normal for
the country, Oil World said. Perak, the fourth-biggest palm oil
growing region in the country, received about 134 percent of
normal precipitation in November, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
