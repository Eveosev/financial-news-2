Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Jankovic,
whose party won Slovenia’s snap election last month, may fail to
form a new government after smaller party said it won’t take
part in a coalition, TV Slovenija  reported , citing Gregor
Virant, the head of the smaller party.  The Citizens’ List, which holds eight seats in the 90-
member assembly, said “differences in programs” led the party
to decide against joining a coalition with Jankovic’s Positive
Slovenia, Virant said in an interview with the Slovenian public
broadcaster late yesterday.  If Jankovic fails to gather the support of 46 lawmakers in
a vote tomorrow,  Janez Jansa , whose group came second in the
early vote last month, may be nominated as premier-designate,
according to TV Slovenija.  President Danilo Turk on Jan. 5 named Jankovic to form a
cabinet as the euro region nation struggles with mounting debt
and a threat of a credit rating cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
