Former  Swiss central bank  President
Philipp Hildebrand paid the consequences of making a “serious
error” of judgment, his predecessor Jean-Pierre Roth told  Le
Temps  in an interview.  “He knew that several days later there would be a change
in monetary policy, which would affect the franc exchange
rate,” Roth told the Swiss newspaper, after questioning why
Hildebrand didn’t reverse his wife’s currency trade when he
first learned about it.  “In a very difficult economic and monetary environment,
the credibility of the SNB has been hurt, the bank is
weakened,” Roth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
