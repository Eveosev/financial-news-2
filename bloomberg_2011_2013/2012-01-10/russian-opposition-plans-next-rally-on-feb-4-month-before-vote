Russian opposition groups plan their
next protest on Feb. 4, exactly a month before presidential
elections, said Olga Shorina, a spokeswoman for the Solidarity
movement thatâ€™s organizing the rally.  The opposition umbrella group will apply for official
permission for the protest, Shorina said today by phone.
Authorities approved demonstrations on Dec. 10 and Dec. 24 in
central Moscow.  More than 17,000 people have said they may attend the Feb.
4 event, which will include a rally and march through Moscow,
according to a Facebook Inc.  page  set up by the organizers.  Opponents of Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  held two major
protests last month after alleged voter fraud in Dec. 4
parliamentary elections, each time gathering tens of thousands
of people in the Russian capital and other cities. Putin, 59, is
running for election on March 4 and may remain in power for
almost a quarter-century if wins that vote and contests the
presidency again in 2018. He served as president from 2000 to
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
