Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC network will
promote its new series “The River” by showing two full
episodes in movie theaters in a bid to lift ratings for the
second-place network.  “We love the idea and we think that the benefits of making
the show available to more viewers outweigh the impact it might
have on ratings for the show,” Paul Lee, president of ABC
Entertainment, said in an interview at a conference of TV
critics today in Pasadena,  California .  ABC, which lags behind CBS in prime-time ratings,
previously showed full episodes of “Modern Family” and “Last
Man Standing” on the ABC.com website, Lee said. Initial viewer
numbers for those shows grew beyond the network’s projections,
he said.  The theatrical release will start in  Los Angeles  on Jan.
18, according to ABC. Later this month the episodes will appear
in cinemas in  New York , Philadelphia and Austin,  Texas .  “The River” is a one-hour drama that follows the story of
a wildlife expert who mysteriously goes missing while filming a
television show in the Amazon. His family and friends search for
him.  The show, from ABC Studios and Steven Spielberg’s
DreamWorks Television, is scheduled to begin airing on the
network starting Feb. 7.  Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 0.3 percent to
$39.63 at the close in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
