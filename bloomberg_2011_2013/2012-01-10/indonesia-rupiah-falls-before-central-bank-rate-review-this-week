Indonesia ’s rupiah fell toward a
six-week low on speculation the central bank will cut its
benchmark  interest rate  this week as inflation slows. Bonds were
little changed.  Bank Indonesia sees room to reduce borrowing costs, Deputy
Governor Hartadi Sarwono said last week after official data
showed consumer prices rose the least in 21 months in December.
Policy makers, who review borrowing costs on Jan. 12, will keep
the  reference rate  unchanged at 6 percent, according to 13 of 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Five predicted a 25-basis
point reduction. The currency has lost 2.3 percent since Nov.
10, when the monetary authority cut the rate by 50 basis points.  “There are rumors that  Bank Indonesia  may surprise with a
25 percent interest-rate cut,” said Mika Martumpal, a senior
market analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “The rupiah
was already under pressure after the rate-cut in November.”  The rupiah slipped 0.5 percent to 9,198 per dollar as of
3:25 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 9,233 yesterday, the weakest
level since Nov. 29.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
was 6.24 percent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Indonesia attracted $3.6 billion of bids for $1.75 billion
of 30-year dollar-denominated bonds it offered for sale, the
 finance ministry  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
