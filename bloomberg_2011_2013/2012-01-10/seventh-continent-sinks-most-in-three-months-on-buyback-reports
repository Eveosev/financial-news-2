OAO Seventh Continent (SCON) , a Russian
food retailer, dropped the most in almost three years after
Kommersant reported the company may offer to buy out minority
shareholders at a price below market levels.  The shares lost 14 percent to 129.85 rubles at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest daily decline since May 2009.
Owner  Alexander Zanadvorov  may offer as little as 100 rubles per
share today as he seeks to delist the company, the Russian
newspaper said before markets opened this morning, citing
unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
