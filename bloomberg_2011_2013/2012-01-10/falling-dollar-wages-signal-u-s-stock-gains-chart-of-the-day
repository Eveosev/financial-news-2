U.S. manufacturers are heading for a
revival as a lower dollar, falling wages and rising productivity
make them more competitive, according to  Sean Darby , Jefferies
Group Inc.’s chief global equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY captures the criteria, cited in a
report yesterday. A trade-weighted dollar index, compiled by the
 Federal Reserve , appears along with a Labor Department indicator
of unit labor costs for manufacturing. The latter gauge reflects
compensation as well as output, or productivity.  “Investors forget that it is the unit labor cost that
matters,” Darby wrote. Manufacturers are benefiting not only
from cost reductions but also from a “currency subsidy” that
stems from the Fed’s quantitative easing, or bond buying, the
report said.  Technology companies and automakers are in recoveries, in
his view. The Hong Kong-based strategist added that agriculture,
coal and mining, oil and aerospace companies have expanded at a
relatively fast pace since 2005.  “The return of U.S. competitiveness” bodes well for
stocks, Darby wrote. He prefers them to  Treasury securities ,
precious metals and commodities, in addition to other equity
markets worldwide in dollar terms.  Share prices are most likely to climb as funds flow out of
bonds and commodities, the report said. Last year was the fifth
consecutive year in which investors withdrew money from equity
funds, according to preliminary figures from the  Investment
Company Institute . They pulled an estimated $132 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
