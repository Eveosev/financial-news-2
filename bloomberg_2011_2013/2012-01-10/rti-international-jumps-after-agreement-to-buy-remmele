RTI International Metals Inc. (RTI)  jumped
the most in more than five weeks after announcing it will buy
manufacturing and machining company Remmele Engineering Inc. for
$164.5 million in cash.  RTI rose 11 percent to $25.91 in  New York , the biggest
increase since Nov. 30. RTI will buy Remmele, owned by
Minneapolis-based private-equity firm Goldner Hawn Johnson &
Morrison Inc., and will take on $18 million of debt for the
deal, which will close in the first quarter, Pittsburgh-based
RTI said in a statement today.  Remmele, based in Minneapolis, provides engineering and
machining services to aerospace, defense and medical-device
customers, RTI said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
