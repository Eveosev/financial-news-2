California (STOCA1)  tax collections since the
fiscal year began in July have fallen short of the budget
estimate by $2.5 billion, the state controller’s office said.  Revenue fell $1.4 billion below expectations in December
alone, Controller John Chiang said in a  statement  today. The
revenue shortfall since the start of the fiscal year had
declined to $1 billion by the end of November. Chiang also said
that revenue in December came in $165 million below what
Governor  Jerry Brown  projected in his latest spending plan,
unveiled Jan. 5.  “While we saw positive numbers in November, December’s
totals failed to meet even the latest revenue projections,”
Chiang said in a statement. “Coupled with higher spending tied
to unrealized cost savings, these latest revenue figures create
growing concern that legislative action may be needed in the
near future to ensure that the state can meet its payment
obligations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
