U.S. gasoline demand fell 1.4

of records, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 8.04 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Jan. 6, down from 8.16 million the week before,
according to MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report. MasterCard’s
data goes back to July 2004.  Fuel demand, which has sunk 15 percent in two weeks,
slipped below year-earlier levels for the 19th consecutive time
last week, declining 4.1 percent from 2010. Gasoline use over
the previous four weeks was 3.3 percent below a year earlier,
the 42nd consecutive decline in that measure.  Gasoline consumption in 2011 fell 1.6 percent from 2010,
