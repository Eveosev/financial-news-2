The European Union extended to
 Malaysia  a tariff on automotive-industry wire from  China , saying
Chinese exporters used the country to evade the levy meant to
curb competition for  Austria ’s Plansee Metall GmbH.  The EU said Chinese exporters of molybdenum wire shipped it
to the 27-nation bloc via Malaysia to dodge the 64.3 percent
duty. Automotive companies, particularly truckmakers, use
molybdenum wire for coating parts.  The import tax “was circumvented by trans-shipment via
Malaysia,” the EU said in a decision yesterday in Brussels. The
extension will take effect after publication in the bloc’s
 Official Journal  due on Jan. 12.  The EU imposed the trade protection in June 2010 for five
years to protect molybdenum-wire maker Plansee Metall from
below-cost, or “dumped,” imports from China. The targeted
Chinese exporters include  Jinduicheng Molybdenum Co. (601958)   The decision to extend the anti-dumping duty to Malaysia
ends an eight-month  circumvention investigation  that also
covered  Switzerland . The probe found no circumvention had taken
place via Switzerland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
