(Corrects scope of decline in first paragraph.)  British American Investment Co. (BRIT) , a
Kenyan financial services group that began trading its shares on
Sept. 8, warned full-year profit may fall at least 25 percent
because of the  “poor performance” of its equity portfolio.  The company, based in Nairobi, commented in a statement e-
mailed by the city’s stock exchange today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
