Billionaire  Mark Cuban , who will be
featured in an advertisement for  Skechers USA Inc. (SKX)  shoes during
the Super Bowl, said he isn’t an investor in the company.  “I just really like mid-foot strike technology and
Skechers is the best,” Cuban said today in an e-mail. “I have
been wearing their shoes since they came out 3 or 4 years ago.”  Skechers, based in Manhattan Beach, California, announced
earlier today that Cuban would be featured in an advertisement
via a press release headlined, “Mark Cuban ‘Buys Into’
Skechers” that prompted a rise in the share price.  The Super Bowl ad highlighting Skechers’  GOrun  shoe will be
part of a campaign that also includes Cuban in print and online
marketing, the company said. Skechers has been working to
increase its appeal as an athletic brand with endorsement deals
with former professional sports stars such as  Joe Montana  and
 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar .  Skechers  advanced  8.4 percent to $12.42 at the close in New
York. The shares fell 39 percent last year.  Cuban is owner of the National Basketball Association’s
Dallas Mavericks, the HDNet high-definition television channel
and the Landmark Theater chain.  The ad will mark the third-straight year Skechers has
bought air time during the National Football League championship
game. Last year’s commercial featured reality-television star
 Kim Kardashian . The game airs Feb. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
