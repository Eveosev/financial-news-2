HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank by market value, named Jean Beunardeau as chief executive
officer of HSBC France.  Beunardeau, the deputy CEO since 2010, replaces Christophe de Backer, who leaves after 21 years at the bank to join Edmond
de Rothschild Group, London-based HSBC said in a statement
today.  HSBC said in July it planned to cut 672 jobs at its French
division over the next three years to reduce costs and boost
profitability. Posts in  information technology  and at its Paris
head office will be cut, the bank said at the time.  Beunardeau, 49, retains responsibility for HSBC’s
investment bank in France, the company said. Gilles Denoyel has
been appointed deputy CEO in addition to his duties as chief
risk officer, the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
