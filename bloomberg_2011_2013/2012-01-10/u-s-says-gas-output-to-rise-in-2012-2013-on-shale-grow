Natural gas production in the U.S.
will rise to record levels this year and in 2013 on increased
output from shale formations, the government said.  Marketed gas production will average 67.34 billion cubic
feet a day this year, up from 65.92 billion last year, the
Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook ,
released today in  Washington . The department had pegged 2012
output at 67.72 billion in its December report. Production in
2013 was estimated at 68.04 billion cubic feet a day.  Gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, will
average $3.53 per million British thermal units this year, down
from the previous estimate of $3.70, according to the report
from the department’s Energy Information Administration..  “We are definitely seeing record production this year,”
said Howard Gruenspecht, acting administrator for the Energy
Department, said today on a conference call. “We see it rising a
little bit more next year but not as fast a rate as it
rose from 2010 to 2011.”  U.S. stockpiles may climb to a record 3.96 trillion cubic
feet at the end of October 2012 and 3.99 trillion a year later,
according to the report.  “Unusually warm winters or mild summers could potentially
strain available storage capacity over the next two years,
leading to temporary shut-in production and lower prices for
natural gas,” the department said.  Natural gas for February delivery fell 9 cents, or 3
percent, to $2.921 per million Btu at 1:28 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
