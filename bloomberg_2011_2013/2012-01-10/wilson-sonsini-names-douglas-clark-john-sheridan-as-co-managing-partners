Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati  the
 law firm  specializing in technology clients, named Douglas Clark
and John T. Sheridan as co-managing partners, succeeding Steven E. Bochner.  Bochner, who has served as chief executive officer since
August 2009, will return full time to his corporate law
practice, the firm said today in a statement.  “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to have served as
CEO,” Bochner said in the statement. “But working with clients
always has been my passion and I felt that the time was right to
return to full-time practice.”  Clark, who joined the  Palo Alto , California-based firm in
1993, served as head of the litigation department for six years.
Sheridan has been head of the firm’s business law department for
five years. He joined  Wilson Sonsini  in 1986.  “Both Doug and Jack have superb strategic and operational
expertise that makes them uniquely qualified to pick up the
mantle from Steve,” Chairman Larry Sonsini said in the
statement. “They know the firm, its people and operations and
the legal business inside out.”  Under Bochner’s leadership, the firm has expanded with new
offices in  China , Delaware and Brussels and in strategic
practices such as antitrust, global  capital markets  and
corporate governance, Sonsini said.  The management transition will take place over the next
month, the firm said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
