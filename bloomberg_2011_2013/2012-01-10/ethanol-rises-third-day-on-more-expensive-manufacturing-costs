Ethanol futures gained for a third
day in  Chicago  amid higher production costs.  Prices rose to a five-week high on concern that corn costs
will be higher if dry, hot weather hurts crops in  South America 
and boosts demand for U.S. supplies. Corn has climbed 7.4
percent from a year ago.  “It hung in there, relative to corn,” said  Chris Wilson ,
an analyst at First Capitol Risk Management in Galena, Illinois.
“The rain everyone expected over the weekend wasn’t there, but
the market priced it in yesterday. Today it is taking a break.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 0.5 cent to
settle at $2.263 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since Dec. 5. Futures have fallen 1 percent in the
past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  increased 3.5
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.35 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive climbed 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.35,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf advanced 1 cent, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.305 a gallon and in Chicago, the fuel gained 1 cent, or
0.5 percent, to $2.215.  Corn futures for March delivery settled at $6.52 a bushel.
One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
