North Dakota  oil production surged
42 percent to 510,000 barrels a day in November, exceeding the
output of OPEC member Ecuador, as energy explorers accelerated
 drilling  in the Bakken Shale formation.  The state’s daily crude output topped a half-million
barrels for the first time during the month, North Dakota’s Oil
and Gas Division said today in a  statement . North Dakota’s 6,300
wells produced enough oil to displace imports from foreign
suppliers such as Iraq or  Colombia , Lynn Helms, division
director, said in the release.  Oil producers including  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)  and  Continental
Resources Inc (CLR) . have spurred a five-fold increase in North
Dakota’s oil output by using intensive drilling practices to tap
the Bakken, a geologic formation that stretches from southern
Alberta to the northern U.S. Great Plains. It’s estimated to
hold as much as 4.3 billion barrels of tecnically recoverable
oil in North Dakota and  Montana , according to a 2008  report  by
the  U.S. Geological Survey .  “This is big news for the state and the country,” Helms
said. “Oil production in the state has increased anywhere from
8,000 to 40,000 barrels a day every month since June.”  Production will continue to increase as drillers hone their
techniques, Andrew Steinhubl, co-leader of consulting firm Bain
& Co.’s North American oil and gas practice, said in a Jan. 6
interview from Houston.  Rising Crude Production  In the Bakken formation alone, crude production rose 56
percent in November to 443,425 barrels a day from a year
earlier, state figures showed. Bakken oil accounted for 87
percent of the state’s total November output.  Continental, the Enid, Oklahoma-based oil company
 controlled  by billionaire Harold Hamm, is the largest
leaseholder in the Bakken shale region, with 901,000 acres,
based on third-quarter 2011 data compiled by Bloomberg
Industries. Hess Corp. of  New York  and Denver-based Whiting
Petroleum Corp. are second and third with 900,000 acres and
680,000 acres, respectively.  Bakken crude is a low-sulfur variety preferred by refiners
not equipped to handle heavier, more corrosive types of oil.
Bakken crude rose 1.5 percent to $97.97 a barrel today at the
Clearbrook, Minnesota, hub, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price has  increased  15 percent in the past year.  Ecuador, with 500,000 barrels of daily output in November,
was the smallest member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, according to data from the  International
Energy Agency  in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
