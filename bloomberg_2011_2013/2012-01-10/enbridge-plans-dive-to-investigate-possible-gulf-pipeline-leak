Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  is planning a dive to
investigate a possible leak on its Stingray natural-gas pipeline
in the  Gulf of Mexico .  A helicopter inspection found a three-foot (0.91 meter)
patch of bubbles near the line, the Calgary-based pipeline
operator said in a statement. The dive will take place as soon
as weather permits.  “The Stingray pipeline continues to operate under normal
operating parameters,” Terrance McGill, an Enbridge vice
president, said in the statement. “We are in contact with
regulatory authorities.”  If a leak is confirmed, the company will begin repairs
immediately, according to the statement. Enbridge doesn’t expect
any material interruptions.  Stingray is a 36-inch diameter, 325-mile line that can
carry as much as 560 million cubic feet of gas daily.  To contact the reporters on this story:
