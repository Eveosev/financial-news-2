Spanish home sales declined in
November for a ninth month as the economy contracted and
unemployment surged.  The number of  transactions  fell 14.4 percent from a year
earlier, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , the People’s Party leader
whose government took over from the Socialists on Dec. 22, has
said he will restore a tax rebate for the purchase of homes to
spur the market as a 23 percent  unemployment  rate weighs on
demand.  Spain  is struggling to work through an excess of 700,000
new homes after the collapse of a building boom saddled banks
with 176 billion euros ($225 billion) of what the Bank of Spain
calls “troubled” assets linked to real estate.  Spain’s economy contracted in the final months of 2011 as
tourism and exports, the drivers of a recovery in the first-half
from a three-year slump, weakened, the Bank of Spain said on
Dec. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
