Joseph Cheng , a political science
professor at the  City University  of Hong Kong comments on the
outlook for Taiwan presidential elections on Jan. 14.  Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou is seeking a second four-year
team against main opponent Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the
 Democratic Progressive Party .  On the election outcome:  “People seem to think the incumbent Ma Ying-jeou has an
edge, but this edge is very, very thin at the moment.”  On the candidates:  Ma “is seen to be a very clean politician, which is
important in Taiwan politics, but he is not believed to be very
competent. Then you have the factors of the divisions over China
policy; divisions between the north and south, as well as the
widening of the gap between rich and poor.”  Tsai “lacks experience in actual campaigning.”  On the DPP’s stance on  China  relations:  “The party worries about being too close to China and
wants to maintain a maximum degree of autonomy for Taiwan.  The DPP ‘‘understands that they can’t afford to provoke
Beijing because the two economies are very integrated. They are
all part of the international production chain, producing for
the developed countries’ markets. The green camp would like to
make the distinction it is keen to maintain a certain distance
from the mainland.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
