Taiwan ’s dollar rallied by the most
in five weeks and government bonds fell on optimism European
policy makers will be able to resolve their debt crisis.  The  Taiex index  of shares rose the most in a week after
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said they “want Greece to stay in the euro” at a joint
press conference yesterday. Foreign funds bought $334 million
more of the island’s stocks than they sold today, according to
exchange data. Taiwan reported toward the end of  currency
trading  yesterday that  exports  gained 0.6 percent from a year
earlier in December, the least in 26 months.  “The export numbers were bad, but the positive sentiment
across Asian markets today overrode that,” said  James Wang , a
fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “Market
moves are going to be limited before the presidential election”
on Jan. 14, he said.  The island’s dollar strengthened 0.5 percent to NT$30.051
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
That’s the biggest gain since Dec. 1. The yield on the 1 percent
notes due January 2017 gained one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.986 percent, prices from Gretai
Securities Market show.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was unchanged at 0.40 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
