Dubai (PGCRDUBA)  crude rose for a third day to
the highest price since Nov. 14, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  No partial deals were completed in the pricing window, with
buyers and sellers separated by 1 cent, according to a poll of
traders who monitor the Platts market. Arcadia Petroleum Ltd.
bid for 25,000 barrels of Dubai crude at $110.79.  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc. (RDSA)  and  South Korea ’s  SK Innovation Co. (096770)  offered partial
cargoes at $110.80.  Gazprom OAO (OGZD)  tried to buy Minas for a fourth
day, bidding $121.75 a barrel. There were no offers.  PV Oil Co.,  Vietnam ’s state-owned oil marketing company,
offered to sell two 250,000-barrel cargoes of its Ruby crude for
loading March 5-11 and March 18-24. Bids are due Jan. 13.  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) , the nation’s largest refiner, bought 4
million barrels of Nigerian crude and 650,000 barrels from  Libya 
for loading in March via a tender. The company purchased EA and
Erha grades from  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , and Es Sider from  Total
SA. (FP)  Indian Oil also bought Escravos and Forcados from Mercuria
Energy Trading SA.  Dubai crude’s 51 cent increase to $111.19 comes as  China ,
the world’s second-largest oil consumer, slowed imports last
year as the economy cooled and crude prices rose. Purchases from
overseas gained 6 percent to 253.78 million metric tons last
year, the General Administration of Customs said in a statement
on its website today. Imports rose 18 percent in 2010 and 14
percent in 2009.  Iran Concerns  Halk Bankasi AS told Indian oil refiners it may no
longer be able to act as an intermediary for their purchases of
Iranian crude, four people with knowledge of the matter said.  Executives from the crude-processing companies met with
Indian oil ministry officials yesterday to discuss alternatives,
including routing remittances through  Russia . Other options
include stopping purchases from  Iran  altogether and importing
from other countries, they said. Indian officials are scheduled
to visit Tehran for trade talks starting Jan. 16, two of the
people said.  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , the
nation’s biggest oil trader, is still negotiating a 2012 crude
supply contract with National Iranian Oil Co., according to two
people with knowledge of the talks.  The contract between China International, known as Unipec,
and NIOC was supposed to have been completed by the end of
December, according to the people, who declined to be identified
because the information is confidential. The trader purchases
more than 200,000 barrels a day, according to a Dec. 19 report
by Facts Global Energy, a Singapore-based consultancy. China
imported 556,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil from January to
November last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
accounting for 11 percent of the country’s total imports.  Full Saudi Allocations  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s largest state-owned
exporter, will provide full contracted crude supplies to Asian
buyers in February.  The Dubai swaps backwardation, a market situation where the
cost of prompt shipments is greater than that for later
deliveries, widened today. Dubai for February rose 10 cents to
$1.12 a barrel more than April shipments, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd. The spread was $3.45 on Nov. 14.  The Singapore refining margin for processing a barrel of
Dubai crude into fuels such as gasoline and diesel was $6.24
this week, compared with an average of $3.83 for the last three
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The February Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European benchmark contract’s premium over the Middle East
grade, fell 28 cents to $3.17 a barrel, according to PVM data at
1:52 p.m. Singapore time. The exchange for swaps for  March (PVMMDBS2)  fell
25 cents to $3.34.  Oman futures for March delivery rose $1.17 to $111.67 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 4:39 p.m. Singapore
time with 1,817 contracts traded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
