Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) , Turkey’s
biggest phone company, is in talks with banks for a loan to
finance capital.  Turk Telekom hasn’t hired a bank to arrange the loan, the
company said in a filing with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  Turk Telekom is seeking $600 million in loans to
refinance existing debt, a person with direct knowledge of the
deal told Bloomberg by telephone last night.  To contact the reporters on this story:
