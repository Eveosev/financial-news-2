Coffee output in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, will likely rise to a record this year as
trees enter the higher-yielding half of a two-year cycle and
rains boost yields, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Production will rise to between 49 million and 52.3 million
bags, from 43.5 million last year, the ministry’s Conab crop-
forecasting agency said today by e-mail in its first estimate
for the coming harvest. That would exceed a record 48.5 million
bags in 2002.  Coffee trees in the Brazilian states of  Minas Gerais  and
Espirito Santo, which produce about three-quarters of the
country’s output, have escaped flooding that has left almost
22,000 people homeless since November. Rainfall will continue to
benefit crops through January, weather forecaster Somar
Meteorologia said yesterday.  Output of the mild-tasting arabica variety will increase to
as much as 39 million bags this year, from 32.2 million bags
last year, Conab said. Output of the robusta variety, used to
make instant coffee, will jump to as much as 13.3 million bags,
from 11.3 million.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilos (132 pounds). Most coffee
harvesting in Brazil starts in May. A new estimate of the crop
will be released on May 10, according to Conab’s website.  Coffee growers expanded planting by 3 percent this year in
Brazil after prices jumped 54 percent in the past two years.
