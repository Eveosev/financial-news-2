Brazil ’s Bovespa index fell for the
first time in six days as mining company  Vale SA  followed metals
lower amid renewed concern that  Greece ’s struggle to secure a
second bailout will hurt global growth.  Vale contributed the most to the gauge’s drop, while
 Bradespar SA , which is part of the group that controls Vale,
fell the most in one week. Card-payment processor  Redecard SA 
surged after  Itau Unibanco Holding SA  offered to buy all
outstanding shares in its unit.  The Bovespa fell 0.1 percent to 65,144.56 at 1:27 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo . Thirty-seven stocks sank on the index, while 33
climbed. The real strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.7225 per  U.S.
dollar . The  Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index 
slid 0.4 percent.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  is convening the
nation’s political leaders to seek consensus on the cuts
required for another European Union-led bailout. Officials are
working on the final draft of the document listing the budget
and structural measures required to receive international
funding, a government official said.  “The more the days go by with no solution for Greece, the
more cautious investors become,” Joao Pedro Brugger, who helps
manage 80 million reais ($46.5 million) at Leme Investimentos,
said by phone from Florianopolis, Brazil. “Stocks linked to
commodities suffer the most when the external outlook seems more
uncertain, but to some extent higher  risk aversion  ends up
affecting all stocks.”  Vale fell 1.1 percent to 43.43 reais. Bradespar dropped 1.4
percent to 35.59 reais.  Redecard Advances  Redecard jumped 8.9 percent to 34.90 reais. Itau plans to
buy 336.4 million common shares of the card-payment processor
for as much as 35 reais each, according to a regulatory filing.  Itau dropped 1.5 percent to 35.51 reais.  Latin America ’s
biggest bank by market value also reported fourth-quarter
adjusted net income of 3.75 billion reais, a 10 percent increase
from a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing. That
matched the mean estimate for adjusted earnings of 3.75 billion
reais in a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.  The Bovespa has advanced 15 percent this year, after
slumping 18 percent in 2011, buoyed by Brazil’s interest-rate
cuts, signs of growth in the U.S. and renewed optimism  Europe 
may be closer to solving its debt crisis. The gauge trades at
10.4 times analysts’ earnings estimates, in line with the ratio
for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21 developing nations’ equities,
weekly data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Traders moved 5.14 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 6.53 billion reais this year through Feb. 3,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
