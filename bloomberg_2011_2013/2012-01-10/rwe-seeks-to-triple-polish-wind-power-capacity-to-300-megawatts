RWE AG (RWE) , Germanyâ€™s second-largest
utility, said it plans to almost triple its wind power capacity
in Poland to 300 megawatts.  RWE is targeting annual growth of 50 megawatts in Poland by
developing its own farms and purchasing external projects, Fritz Vahrenholt, chief executive officer of its Innogy renewable
energy unit, said today in Essen, Germany.  The Taciewo and Krzecin wind farms, with a combined
capacity of 44 megawatts, are due to start operating in the
first and second quarter, he said. RWE Innogy had about 2,480
megawatts of renewable capacity in operation at the end of last
year, including 108 megawatts of  wind turbines  in Poland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
