(Corrects spelling of lawmaker’s name in both paragraphs.)  Greek lawmaker Gerasimos Giakoumatos
of the conservative New Democracy party proposed renting out the
Acropolis in  Athens  and other archeological sites to shore up
the country’s finances,  Bild Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview with the politician.  Giakoumatos said it’s better to rent archeological sites
than to cut wages and pensions further, according to the German
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
