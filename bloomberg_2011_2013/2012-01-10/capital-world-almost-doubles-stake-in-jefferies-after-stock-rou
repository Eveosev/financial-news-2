Capital World Investors, a Los
Angeles-based investment-management company, almost doubled its
stake in  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  as the investment bank’s stock
dropped 48 percent last year.  Capital World acquired 11.1 million shares, bringing its
 total holdings  to 24.1 million shares as of Dec. 30, according
to a regulatory filing today. The firm now owns a 12 percent
stake in Jefferies.  Leucadia National Corp. (LUK) , which holds 29
percent, is the biggest investor, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Jefferies, run by Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler,
 plunged last year  as Wall Street banks struggled to maintain
trading revenue and as  MF Global Holdings Ltd (MFGLQ) .’s Oct. 31
bankruptcy fueled what New York-based Jefferies called unfounded
speculation it may be toppled by Europe’s debt crisis. Leucadia
boosted its holdings by 1.5 million shares in November.  Richard Khaleel, a spokesman for Jefferies, declined to
comment, as did  Chuck Freadhoff  at Capital World.  To contact the reporter on this story:
