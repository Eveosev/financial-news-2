Rubber plantations from Indonesia to
 Ivory Coast  will tap a global crop this year that will create
the biggest glut since at least 2004, cutting costs for
 Bridgestone Corp. (5108) ,  Michelin & Cie . and other tiremakers.  The market will switch to a 413,000-metric-ton surplus,
from an 87,000-ton shortage in 2011 that helped drive rubber to
a record in February,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  estimates. Prices
fell since then on prospects for more supply and slower growth
in China, the largest consumer. Futures will drop as much as 12
percent to 240 yen ($3.12) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) in Tokyo this
year, the lowest since November 2009, the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts and traders shows.  Commodities posted their first annual loss in three years
in 2011 as  China , the biggest user of everything from coal to
cotton to copper, slowed growth to cool inflation that reached a
three-year high in July. Auto sales in the nation rose 2.6
percent in the first 11 months of last year, down from 32
percent in 2010, industry data show. That’s adding to pressure
on raw-material prices, already weakening as economists surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast the slowest global growth since 2009.  “The outlook for rubber prices is linked to global and
Chinese economic growth,” said Chris Pardey, chief executive
officer of Singapore-based RCMA Commodities Asia Group, which
trades natural and synthetic rubber. “My view is negative on
the global economy and therefore negative on rubber.”  Tsunami in  Japan   Prices slumped 49 percent to 273 yen since reaching an
all-time high of 535.7 yen on Feb. 18 on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange. Global car production was disrupted by the earthquake
and tsunami in Japan in March and then by flooding in  Thailand 
in the fourth quarter.  Rubber is the fifth worst-performing commodity among 80
tracked by Bloomberg in the past 12 months, behind two carbon
contracts, rhodium and ruthenium. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI of
24 raw materials rose 6.7 percent as the MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities dropped 8.1 percent. Treasuries returned 9.5
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  World supply will increase 7 percent to 11.8 million tons
this year as demand rises 3 percent to 11.4 million tons,
Goldman analysts led by Yuichiro Isayama in  Tokyo  estimate.
Inventories among members of the Kuala Lumpur-based Association
of Natural Rubber Producing Countries, representing about 92
percent of global  production , will expand 12 percent to 1.45
million tons this year, the group said.  Global Demand  Stockpiles (SHFNRUB)  held by processors and traders in China reached
365,600 tons by the end of December, compared with 46,100 tons
at the end of July, the ANRPC said in a report Jan. 4. The
country accounted for 34 percent of global consumption in 2010,
according to the Singapore-based International Rubber Study
Group. Chinese demand may gain 5 percent to 3.77 million tons
after dropping 1.3 percent last year, the first decline since at
least 2004, Goldman Sachs estimates.  China, now the world’s largest car market, will expand 8.5
percent this year, compared with 9.2 percent in 2011, the median
of 14 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. That would
be slowest since 2001. The economy is experiencing “downside
pressure” and “elevated inflation,” Premier  Wen Jiabao  said
in a statement Jan. 4.  The projected growth in China would still be more than four
times the anticipated 2.1 percent gain in the U.S., forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg show. Auto sales that probably rose about
5 percent last year should accelerate to 10 percent in 2012, the
Beijing-based China Association of Automobile Manufacturers
estimates. The group cut its forecasts twice last year.  Inflation Eases  Inflation (CNCPIYOY)  eased to 4.2 percent in November from a year
earlier, the slowest pace in 14 months, giving the government
greater scope to shore up growth. The central bank will probably
cut lenders’ reserve requirements before a weeklong holiday
starts Jan. 23 to stimulate loans, economists at  Barclays
Capital  and Bank of America said in reports on Dec. 19 and 29.
It already did so last month for the first time since 2008.  The nation  imported  240,000 tons of natural rubber in
November, matching volumes in September that were the highest
since August 2006, customs data show. The gains indicate that
manufacturers anticipate a rebound in demand, said Makiko
Tsugata, an analyst at Market Risk Advisory, a research company
in Tokyo.  Demand for tires may also be bolstered by expanding global
sales of cars and light commercial vehicles, which will advance
6.7 percent to a record 77.7 million units this year, according
to R.L. Polk & Co., a research company in Southfield,  Michigan .
Chinese consumers may buy 16 percent more, it estimates.  Synthetic Rubber  That may still not be enough to diminish the anticipated
glut of natural rubber, which also faces more competition from
synthetics. The material, derived from crude oil, fell 38
percent to $2,750 a ton in the four months through the end of
November, according to data from Sutton, Surrey-based ICIS, a
petrochemical research company.  Output in Thailand may rise 8 percent to 3.7 million tons
in 2012, according to Goldman Sachs.  Indonesia  will harvest 5.1
percent more at 3.1 million tons as supply in  Malaysia  remains
little changed at 1 million tons, the bank said. The three
countries account for 70 percent of production.  The 10-month slump in rubber prices is cutting costs for
tiremakers, which account for about 60 percent of consumption.
Bridgestone, the biggest manufacturer, will report a 35 percent
jump in net income to 160.31 billion yen this year, according to
the mean of 14 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Shares
of the Tokyo-based company rallied 11 percent to 1,762 yen since
the end of August and will reach 2,313 yen in 12 months, the
average of 10 estimates shows.  Rubber Costs  Bridgestone is still facing “relatively high” costs for
synthetic rubber and was unable to recoup all of the gain in
raw-material prices last year, said Kaoru Tomizawa, a spokesman
for the company in Tokyo.  Michelin, the second-largest tiremaker, will report a 3.9
percent decline in profit this year to 1.29 billion euros ($1.65
billion), still its second-highest earnings ever, according to
the mean of 10  estimates . Shares of the Clermont Ferrand,
France-based company fell 12 percent to 47.015 euros in the past
year and will rebound to 66.36 euros in the next 12 months, the
average of 14 projections shows. Fabrice Lenica, a spokesman,
declined to comment on prices.  Debt Crisis  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA) , Thailand’s biggest publicly
traded rubber maker, may report a 1.9 percent rise in sales to
127.3 billion baht ($4 billion) this year, compared with a gain
of almost 50 percent in 2011, according to the mean of 10
estimates. Shares of the Songkhla, Thailand-based company
dropped 51 percent in the past year and will advance 9 percent
to 20.05 baht in the next 12 months, analyst estimates show.
Shares fell along with rubber prices after flood waters
disrupted car production in Thailand, damping the demand
outlook.  Growing demand for rubber may not be reflected by higher
prices because of concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing
growth in China, said Kitichai Sincharoenkul, executive director
of Sri Trang. Sales may gain 15 percent to 1.15 million tons, he
said, declining to comment on the outlook for profit.  “The period of high growth in natural rubber demand has
ended,” said Zhao Cheng, a commodities analyst at Zhongcai
Futures Co. in Chongqing, China. “The whole manufacturing
sector is in contraction and natural rubber demand will
certainly grow at a slower pace.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
