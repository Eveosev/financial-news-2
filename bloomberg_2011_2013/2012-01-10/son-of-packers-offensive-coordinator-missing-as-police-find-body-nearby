Police in Oshkosh,  Wisconsin ,
recovered the body of a man who fell through the ice and drowned
in a river near where the 21-year-old son of Green Bay Packers
offensive coordinator Joe Philbin went missing.  The body has been formally identified as Michael Philbin,
ESPN said, citing a person close to the family. Police plan to
disclose the deceased’s name today after notifying his family,
Oshkosh Police Department spokesman Joe Nichols said at a news
conference yesterday.  Michael Philbin was last seen early Jan. 8 after visiting
friends at the  University of Wisconsin  at Oshkosh. Police began
searching the Fox River after a report that a person fell
through the ice at about 2:30 a.m. local time.  Divers found a body in the river yesterday afternoon,
Nichols said. Foul play isn’t suspected and the matter is under
investigation, he said.  The Packers, who are preparing to face the  New York Giants 
in the second round of the National Football League playoffs,
canceled player interviews yesterday after learning that
Philbin’s son was missing.  Philbin, the team’s offensive coordinator since 2007,
traveled to Oshkosh yesterday, Packers coach  Mike McCarthy  said
at a news conference.  “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Philbin family
during this difficult time,” Packers General Manager Ted Thompson said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
