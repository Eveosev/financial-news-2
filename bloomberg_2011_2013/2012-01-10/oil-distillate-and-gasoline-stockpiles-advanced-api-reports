Crude oil inventories rose 397,000
barrels to 334.9 million last week, the  American Petroleum
Institute  said.  Distillate fuel inventories  rose 846,000 barrels to 146.2
million, the APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Gasoline stockpiles 
rose 1.89 million barrels to 221 million.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, declined
173,000 barrels to 29.1 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil rose
1 million barrels last week, according to the median of 12
responses in a  Bloomberg News (DOEASCRD)  survey of analysts. Gasoline
inventories probably gained 2.25 million barrels, the survey
showed. Distillates were also expected to grow by 2.25 million.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for February delivery rose 88 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $102.19 a barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading
