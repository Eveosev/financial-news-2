The  Sports Authority (27542MF)  of Nashville
and Davidson County, which owns the stadium used by the  National
Football League ’s Tennessee Titans, is selling $35 million of
taxable revenue bonds with yields near the lowest since 1994.  The authority will use $11 million to refund existing debt,
saving more than $1 million, and the rest for improvements
including high-definition scoreboards and an improved sound
system, said  Richard Riebeling , director of finance for the
Nashville metropolitan government, of which the authority is
part. It will be the first bond sale by the nonprofit authority
since construction  began  on the stadium in 1997.  “The idea was to sell the bonds as soon as the season was
over so the improvements could be made in time for next football
season,” Riebeling said. “As the stadium enters into its 14th
or 15th year, we felt there was a need to do a more intensive
capital program.”  The new bonds mature from 2013 to 2033, according to the
preliminary official statement. Similarly rated taxable debt due
in 10 years yielded 3.79 percent yesterday, according to a
Bloomberg Fair Value  index . On Oct. 5, the yield touched 3.7
percent, the lowest since at least 1994.  The authority, which plans to issue as soon as today, is
selling taxable debt because of the amount of private use and
revenue coming into the stadium, Riebeling said, which might
have jeopardized the interest-tax exemption granted to public
debt. Taxable muni bonds returned 21 percent in 2011, almost
twice that of tax-exempt debt, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes tracking prices and interest payments.  Backed by Fees  A $2 fee on each ticket for the 68,798-seat stadium will
back the refunding bonds, Riebeling said. The city has paid the
team $1 million yearly for upkeep, he said.  The Titans have sold out every game at LP Field since the
team  began playing there  in 1999, Riebeling said. They moved
from Houston in 1997, retaining the Oilers name, and played
their games at the Liberty Bowl in  Memphis  the first year. They
played the 1998 season at Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville before
inaugurating LP Field as the Titans.  Moody’s Investors Service rates the bonds Aa2, its third-
highest grade. It cited the “added security” from the
government’s pledge to use all available non-tax revenue if
ticket surcharges, parking income and rent payments aren’t
sufficient for debt service.  Moody’s has a negative outlook on $464.59 million of
outstanding authority bonds. It said pledged revenue has been
insufficient to pay debt service several times in the past 10
years.  The stadium improvements also include elevators to the
upper concourses and fan zones, according to the offering
document.  Tennessee State University (50985MF)  rents the stadium for its
games.  The  Tennessee Titans  finished the 2011 NFL season at 9-7,
missing the playoffs. The Titans averaged an actual attendance
of 69,143 per home game, which ranks 14th among the 32 NFL
teams, according to ESPN  data .  To contact the reporter on this story:
