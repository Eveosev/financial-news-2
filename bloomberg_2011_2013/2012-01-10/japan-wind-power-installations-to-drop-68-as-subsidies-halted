Japan ’s wind power installations for
the year ending in March will decline 68 percent after the
government halted a program that provided subsidies for clean
energy projects, an industry association said.  The country will add 33 turbines generating 82 megawatts of
wind power for the year ending March, according to an estimate
by the Japan Wind Power Association  released  today. For the year
ended March 2011, Japan installed 256 megawatts.  Japan stopped direct subsidies in 2010 that paid for a
third of the cost of renewable energy projects as the country
planned a shift to an incentive payment program, Takao Hanaoka,
a spokesman for the association, said by phone today. The
preferential tariffs, due to start in July, have yet to be set
and that may have contributed to the decline, Hanaoka said.  Japan is targeting an increase in renewable energy
generation as most of the country’s atomic reactors are shut
for checks following the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl
last March. Before the accident, atomic power provided about 30
percent of Japan’s electricity supply.  The country’s cumulative wind power capacity may reach
2,600 megawatts by March 2014 from the current 2,522 megawatts,
the association said, urging the government to make an early
decision on the tariffs and wind power generation targets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
