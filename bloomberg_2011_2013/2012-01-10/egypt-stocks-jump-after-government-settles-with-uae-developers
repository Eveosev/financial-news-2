Egyptian shares climbed the most in
six weeks, led by real-estate companies, after the government
settled land disputes with United Arab Emirates developers.  The benchmark  EGX 30 Index  climbed 2.4 percent to 3,735.64
at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the biggest daily advance since
Nov. 29.  Talaat Moustafa Group Holding (TMGH) , the country’s largest
publicly traded developer, surged 6.1 percent.  Six of October
Development & Investment Co ., also known as Sodic, rose for the
first time in five days.  An Egyptian government commission approved the settlement
of disputes with Dubai’s Damac Properties Co. and Al-Futtaim
Group, Fayza Aboulnaga, minister of planning and international
cooperation, said Jan. 7. Governments serving under former
President  Hosni Mubarak  sold the two companies land without
holding a public auction as required by law, which prompted
courts to annul the sales after his ouster in February.  “Progress made by the government in resolving disputes
with UAE developers is acting as a catalyst for the real estate
sector,” said Tamer Nigm, head of sales and trading at Cairo-
based Watheeqa Securities Brokerage. “It shows the government
is willing to work with local businesses to encourage
investment.”  Talaat Moustafa increased the most since Nov. 29 to 2.98
Egyptian pounds. Sodic, a luxury real-estate developer, soared
6.3 percent to 7.91 pounds.  Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC) , rose
3.7 percent to 1.11 pounds, the highest in more than a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
