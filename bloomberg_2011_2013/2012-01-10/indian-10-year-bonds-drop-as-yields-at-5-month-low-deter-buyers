India ’s 10-year bonds declined on
speculation yields near a five-month low will deter investors.  Benchmark yields have declined 34 basis points this month
on speculation the central bank will ease its monetary policy
stance when it meets on Jan. 24 to support economic  growth . The
 finance ministry  will sell 140 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) of
government notes on Jan. 13, part of a record 5.1 trillion rupee
borrowing program for the fiscal year ending March.  “The fall in debt yields in the past few days has been
drastic and unexpected, and investors are probably paring their
holdings,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager of treasury at
Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Large debt supplies are also
damping sentiment.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.23 percent as
of 9:45 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate touched 8.20 percent yesterday, the lowest
level for benchmark 10-year securities since Aug. 10.  Asia ’s third-largest economy will grow about 7 percent in
the year ending March, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said on
Jan. 8, less than a prediction of 7.5 percent he made in
December. Industrial  production  shrank 5.1 percent in October
from a year earlier, the first contraction since June 2009,
official data showed last month.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose five basis points to 7.79 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
