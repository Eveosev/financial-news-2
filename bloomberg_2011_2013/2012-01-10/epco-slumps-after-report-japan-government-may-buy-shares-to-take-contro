Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  shares fell
as much as 12 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said the
government may buy common shares to take control of the utility.  The stock fell as much as 12 percent to 153 yen, the lowest
intra-day price since June 9 last year. It traded at 170 yen at
10:52 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Tepco has dropped 92
percent since the day before the March 11 quake and tsunami
wrecked its Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, causing radiation
leaks and mass evacuations.  The government-backed Nuclear Damage Liability Facilitation
Fund plans to acquire common stock as early as this summer, as
part of a 1 trillion yen ($13 billion) capital injection into
the company, the Nikkei newspaper  reported  on Jan. 7.  “The issue of a capital injection is an option, yet no
conclusions to discussions have been reached,” said Chie
Hosoda, a spokeswoman for Tepco. She declined to comment on
negotiations with banks cited in a Nikkei report today.  Without the capital, the utility faces insolvency by the
end of March 2013 because of dismantling and decommissioning
costs for the reactors at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant as well
as rising fuel costs to run thermal plants, the newspaper said.  Separately, the utility and banks will start talks this
week for lending an additional 1 trillion yen as early as April,
the Nikkei  reported  today, without saying who provided the
information. Tepco received 2 trillion yen in emergency loans
last year related to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
