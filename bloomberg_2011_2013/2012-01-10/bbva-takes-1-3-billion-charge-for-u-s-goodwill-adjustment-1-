Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
 Spain ’s second-biggest lender, plans to take a charge of about 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion) to 2011 earnings after adjusting
for goodwill at its U.S. business.  The adjustment won’t affect the bank’s generation of  cash
flow  or its liquidity position and dividend payments, the
Bilbao, Spain-based lender said in  a filing  to regulators today.
It will boost core capital by 400 million euros because of the
tax treatment of goodwill, the bank said.  BBVA, which made a 704 million-euro writedown for U.S.
goodwill against 2009 earnings, said the new charge reflected
the growth outlook and banking regulatory environment in the
country. It follows moves by other lenders including Italy’s
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , which announced an 8.7 billion-euro impairment in
November after acquisitions at home and in eastern  Europe .  “It doesn’t look good when you do it for a second time,”
said  Andrea Williams , who helps manage about $1 billion,
including BBVA shares, as head of European equities at Royal
 London  Asset Management. The “big picture” for all Spanish
banks is the need to recognize losses on real estate, she said.  BBVA shares rose 3.7 percent to 6.20 euros as of 1:24 p.m.
in Madrid trading, paring the stock’s decline over the past 12
months to 10 percent.  Second Impairment  BBVA has built a 745-branch business in the southern U.S.
through acquisitions, including its $9 billion purchase of
Compass Bancshares Inc. in 2007.  “They did pay an awful lot for it and it’s the second time
they’ve impaired it,” said  John Raymond , an analyst at
CreditSights Inc. in London.  The bank may report 2011 net income of 4.18 billion euros,
according to the average estimate out of 22 analyst forecasts
 compiled  by Bloomberg. BBVA’s 2010 profit was 4.61 billion
euros.  “Even though during 2011 there has been a positive
evolution of profits and activity in this unit, compared to the
previous year, the latest forecasted economic growth for the
U.S. and the impact of the new regulatory framework in the
financial industry have slowed down the forecasted growth in
future profits,” the bank said in its filing.  The U.S. business posted a 218 million-euro profit in the
first nine months of 2011, down from 223 million euros in the
year-earlier period. Goodwill is the amount exceeding fair net
book value paid at the time of an acquisition.  To contact the reporter for this story:
