Hedge fund billionaire  Philip Falcone  urged U.S. regulators to help resolve interference
issues that have delayed government approval of his LightSquared
Inc. wireless service.  Falcone and two LightSquared representatives met Jan. 4
with Federal Communications Commission staff and “emphasized
the significant investment that has already been made in the
LightSquared network,” according to a filing posted yesterday
on the agency’s website.  LightSquared is seeking U.S. clearance after tests found
its service may interfere with global-positioning system
devices.  LightSquared (SKYT)  has developed technology that has
“narrowed considerably” the scope of technical issues, Falcone
and his associates told regulators during the meeting, according
to the filing.  Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners hedge fund is backing
Reston, Virginia-based LightSquared with a $3 billion
investment. Harbinger peaked at $26 billion in 2008 after a
successful bet on the housing market and has slipped to $5.7
billion in assets.  Makers of navigation gear said the service’s powerful
signals from 40,000 base stations would overwhelm faint
emissions from satellites that feed GPS devices. U.S. officials
said last month that LightSquared disrupts safety equipment that
uses GPS to help keep airliners from crashing into the ground.  Sprint Nextel Corp. on Jan. 5 said it put its investment in
a partnership with LightSquared on hold as the company seeks
government clearance.  ‘Technical Solutions’  LightSquared says GPS devices improperly gather signals
from its swath of airwaves. The company has proposed initially
operating at reduced power levels, according to the filing.  “We discussed various alternative technical solutions that
will effectively and economically allow GPS devices to work as
intended, and still allow the deployment of the LightSquared
network,” according to LightSquared’s filing, which was signed
by Jeffrey Carlisle, the company’s executive vice president.  Present at last week’s meeting were FCC Chief of Staff
 Edward Lazarus , Amy Levine, a special counsel and Paul de Sa,
chief of the agency’s Office of Strategic Planning and Policy
Analysis, according to the filing.  Terry Neal, a LightSquared spokesman, declined in an e-mail
to elaborate on the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
