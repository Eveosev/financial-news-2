M.H. Alshaya Co., a Kuwaiti retail
franchise operator, said it plans to invest 100 million pounds
($155 million) in the U.K. retail industry over the next two
years through its acquisition of La Senza U.K.  Alshaya “has today reached agreement to take control of
the ongoing La Senza business in the U.K.,” it said in an e-
mailed statement today. Plans for the business include new
product collections and store redesigns.  KPMG, the administrators of La Senza, a lingerie chain,
said yesterday they had agreed to sell 60 stores to Alshaya U.K.
Ltd. La Senza closed 84 stores and 18 concessions after
announcing at the end of last month that it was seeking
administration.  “This is a strategic investment for us and a positive
addition to our extensive international retail portfolio,”
Executive Chairman Mohammed Alshaya said in the statement.  Closely held M.H. Alshaya operates more than 55
international brands in 19 countries, including the  Persian Gulf
states , Jordan, Lebanon,  Russia ,  Egypt , Turkey, and central and
eastern  Europe . It employs over 22,000 people in more than 2,000
stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
