Makhteshim-Agan Industries Ltd. (MAIN) , the
world’s largest maker of generic agrochemicals, said it won a
lawsuit brought by  BASF SE (BAS)  that had accused the company of
infringing insecticide patents.  Makhteshim’s insecticides using the chemical fipronil don’t
infringe two BASF patents, U.S. District Judge William Osteen in
Greensboro,  North Carolina , ruled yesterday, according to a
statement by Makhteshim. Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF, the
world’s biggest chemical company, had claimed Makhteshim
violated patents that cover the Termidor insecticide.  Termidor , which has been sold for more than 10 years, is
the top-selling termite product in the U.S. Makhteshim, based in
 Israel , said it introduced the first generic version of fipronil
in June with its Taurus and Prefurred pest-control products.
BASF said in a statement it would appeal the ruling, and the
decision doesn’t affect the validity or enforceability of its
manufacturing patents for fipronil.  BASF also had sued  Cheminova A/S  over the same technology.
The companies agreed to settle that case, BASF said, and
Cheminova won’t make or sell its fipronil product until the
patents expire. Further terms weren’t disclosed, BASF said.  China National Chemical Corp. bought a 60 percent stake in
Makhteshim in an agreement that valued the agrochemical company
at $2.4 billion.  The cases are BASF Agro B.V. Arnhem Wadenswil Branch v.
Cheminova Inc., 10-cv-00274, and BASF Agro B.V. Arnhem v.
Makhteshim Agan of  North America , 10-cv-00276, U.S. District
Court, Middle District of North Carolina.  To contact the reporters on this story:
