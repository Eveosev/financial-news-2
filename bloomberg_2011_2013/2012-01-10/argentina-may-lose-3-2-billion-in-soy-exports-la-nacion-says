Argentina  may lose as much as $3.2
billion-worth of soy exports as dry weather hurts crops,
newspaper La Nacion  reported , citing the Acsoja soybean group.  Production will probably drop by as much as seven million
tons and fail to reach expected output of about 52 million tons
this year, according to the newspaper.  Agriculture Minister Norberto Yahuar said the agriculture
industry will not receive aid from the government and that it
should “be less dramatic” about the drought, the Buenos Aires-
based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
