Egypt ’s central bank will offer 18
billion Egyptian pounds ($3 billion) of seven-day  repurchase
agreements  today, 29 percent more than last week, after the
government increased short-term borrowings.  The repo offering comes a day after the  Finance Ministry 
exceeded its goal in the sale of three-month treasury bills by
36 percent as it sought to stem yield gains on longer-term
securities.  Three-month notes  yielded 13.83 percent, down 12
basis points from the previous auction. That compares with an
average yield of 15.386 percent on  nine-month bills , the highest
since Bloomberg started tracking data in 2006.  The repo agreements allow holders of  government securities 
to sell them back to the central bank to access funds for a week
at 9.75 percent. The political instability that followed the
ouster of former President  Hosni Mubarak  almost a year ago
prompted foreign investors to retreat and drove up Egypt’s local
borrowing costs more than 40 percent in 2011 as the state turned
to domestic banks to meet its funding needs.  The central bank started offering repurchase contracts last
March to help ease funding pressure on banks, whose holdings of
government securities rose 31 percent in the first nine months
of the year. Last week, the central bank offered 14 billion
pounds of repos.  The yield on the government’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar
bonds due April 2020 rose for a second day, gaining 15 basis
points, or 0.15 of a percentage point, to a record 8.52 percent
at 11:25 a.m. in Cairo.  The pound  was little changed at 6.0396 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
