Russia said it regrets the start of
 uranium enrichment  by Iran and urged negotiations on the
nation’s nuclear program.  “Iran continues to ignore requests by the international
community to remove concerns about its nuclear program,
including the suspension of its enrichment facility near the
city of Qom,” the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said today in a
 statement  on its website.  Russia called for the start of “serious talks” on  Iran’s
nuclear program , urging all parties to avoid “ill-considered
and abrupt moves,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
