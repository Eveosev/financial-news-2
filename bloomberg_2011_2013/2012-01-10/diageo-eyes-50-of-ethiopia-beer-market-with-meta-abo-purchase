Diageo Plc (DGE) , the world’s biggest
liquor maker, wants to boost its share of Ethiopia’s beer market
to 50 percent from the current 15 percent as it completes the
acquisition of a state-owned brewery in the Horn of Africa
nation.  The purchase of Meta Abo Brewery, which produces Meta and
Meta Premium beers, for $225 million was first announced by the
Ethiopian privatization agency in October.  “We would like to grow this business massively and beat
the competition,” Ekwunife Okoli, Diageo’s head of African
regional markets, told reporters at the brewery in Sebeta, 30
kilometers (19 miles) from the capital,  Addis Ababa .  The U.K.-based company, which produces Guinness beer,
Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whisky, will invest “to build
capacity to meet demand,” said Diageo’s Africa president, Nick
Blazquez. Diageo may introduce its other products to the
Ethiopian market, he said.  Ethiopia ’s beer market may grow by more than 10 percent
each year to 2015 amid the country’s rising economic growth, the
company said in a statement. The economy of Africa’s second-most
populous nation will expand between 6 percent and 8 percent over
the same period, according to the  International Monetary Fund   Meta’s former huge popularity and Ethiopia’s “growing
middle class” means Diageo may double sales in three years,
said Francis Agbonlahor, managing director for the country. He
declined to provide specific figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
