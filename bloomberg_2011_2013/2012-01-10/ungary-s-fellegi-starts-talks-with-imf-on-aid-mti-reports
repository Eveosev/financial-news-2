Tamas Fellegi, Hungary’s chief
negotiator for a financial bailout, started talks with the
 International Monetary Fund  in Washington yesterday, state news

embassy there.  Fellegi is scheduled to meet IMF Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  on Jan. 12 and will hold consultations with
the lender’s representatives several times this week, MTI said.  It’s the Hungarian government’s “firm intention to reach a
swift agreement to restore market confidence,” according to the
statement, MTI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
