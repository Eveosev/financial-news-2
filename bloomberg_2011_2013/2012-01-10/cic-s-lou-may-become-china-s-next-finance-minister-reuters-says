The chairman of Chinese sovereign
wealth fund  China Investment Corp. (CHIVCZ)  is the leading candidate to
become the next finance minister as the Communist Party begins a
leadership transition this year, Reuters reported today.  Lou Jiwei  will replace Xie Xuren, Reuters said, citing two
people it did not identify. The timing for Lou’s possible move
to the finance ministry was unknown, it said.  The Communist Party begins its transition to new leadership
this year, with top leaders including President Hu Jintao and
Premier Wen Jiabao making way for the younger generation.  China 
replaced its banking and securities regulators in October, the
biggest reshuffle of financial officials in a decade.  Calls to the Ministry of Finance’s press department and
CIC’s press office today seeking comment weren’t immediately
answered.  CIC’s Lou deployed almost all the fund’s cash in 2010 as an
improving world economy prompted a 10 percent gain in the MSCI
World Index. Net income rose 24 percent while the Beijing-based
fund posted an 11.7 percent return on its overseas investments,
according to its July annual report.  CIC was set up in 2007 with an initial $200 billion of
capital from the  finance ministry .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
