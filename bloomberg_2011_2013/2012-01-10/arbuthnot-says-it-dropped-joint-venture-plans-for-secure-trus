Arbuthnot Banking Group (ARBB)  Plc, the
U.K. bank founded in 1833, won’t proceed with a planned joint
venture for consumer unit  Secure Trust Bank (STB)  Plc after failing to
find a structure that met regulatory requirements.  “We are cautious bankers and took the longer-term view
that there are better deals out there,” Chief Operating Officer
Andrew Salmon said in a telephone interview. “There are still a
very large number of other opportunities to consider.”  Arbuthnot owns 75.5 percent of Secure Trust Bank after
listing the unit in November. The firm said in its pre-listing
document that it was in discussions to establish a consumer
financing joint venture with an unnamed third party targeting
people with low incomes. The bank also announced in November the
sale of its investment-banking arm Arbuthnot Securities Ltd. to
U.K. stockbroker  Westhouse Securities (WHL)  Ltd. The deal has not yet
received regulatory approval, Arbuthnot said.  The firm, based in  London , will record a loss of about 1
million pounds ($1.6 million) on the sale of Arbuthnot
Securities, the company said in a statement today. Pretax profit
for 2011 will be about 5 million pounds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
