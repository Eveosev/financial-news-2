Codelco,  Chile ’s state-owned copper
company, filed a lawsuit in a Santiago court today to force
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  to sell it a 49 percent stake in the Sur
mining unit.  Codelco is also seeking damages for non-compliance of a
2002 option agreement that gives it the right to buy the stake,
the Santiago-based company said in a statement sent by e-mail.  Anglo is seeking to protect its ownership of Los Bronces
copper mine, the world’s fifth largest, and two additional
deposits that it has yet to exploit. Anglo isn’t obliged to sell
the stake to Codelco after the Chilean state company breached
the terms of the option by trying to exercise it, the London-
based company said Jan. 3.  Codelco’s lawsuit is “the only possible route when the
counterpart acts in an erratic manner and violates contracts,”
Chief Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  said in the statement.  Anglo is still open to selling Codelco 24.5 percent of the
unit after it sold another 24.5 percent to  Japan ’s Mitsubishi
Corp., it said Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
