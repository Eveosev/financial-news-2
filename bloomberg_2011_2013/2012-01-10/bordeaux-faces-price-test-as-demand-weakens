Prices of top Bordeaux such as
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and  Chateau Petrus  may drop further at
Hong Kong sales this month as demand declines on concern about
economic weakness and financial-market volatility.  Auctions by Acker, Merrall & Condit,  Sotheby’s (BID)  and Zachys
leading up to Chinese New Year celebrations could fetch more
than $23 million, based on the auction houses’ top estimates.
Still, this is about 33 percent below the combined $34.59
million total fetched by the same three events in January 2011.  The  Liv-ex Fine Wine 100 Index  fell 15 percent last year,
as first-half price gains for Bordeaux were followed by declines
in the latter part of 2011. Demand from Chinese buyers also
started to move away from Bordeaux first growths to rarer
Burgundies and second-growth Medocs.  “It used to be that top-end first growths would fly out
the door at any price point,” said Rufus Beazley, head
representative for Berry Brothers & Rudd’s Shanghai office. “We
are seeing a lot of diversification into second growths and
other grands crus wines that are being bought for drinking
instead and less speculative punting on first growths.”  Acker’s  sale on Jan. 13 and Jan. 14 features two cases of
1985 Romanee-Conti Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, Burgundy’s
premier wine made from a vineyard measuring just 4.3 acres (1.75
hectares). Each case carries an upper estimate of HK$1.6 million
($200,000), as well as a case of DRC 1990 with a similar price.
Six bottles of the 2005 are estimated at as much as HK$800,000.  Haut-Brion  Bordeaux on sale includes six-magnum lots of 1989 and 1990
Petrus, each estimated to fetch as much as HK$480,000, as well
as a case of Chateau Haut-Brion 1961 at as much as HK$280,000
and six magnums of  Chateau Lafite-Rothschild  2000 at HK$240,000.  The oldest bottle in the  Acker  sale is a double magnum of
1870 Lafite, harvested during the Franco-Prussian war and kept
at the Chateau until sold in 2003 and shipped to the U.S. While
Acker makes no price prediction for the lot,  Fine & Rare Wines 
in London has a single bottle of Lafite 1870 listed at 10,500
pounds ($16,200), implying a value for the double magnum of
about $65,000 plus any rarity premium.  Hong Kong  has established itself as global auction leader
since abolishing wine duties in 2008. Last year, $198 million of
wine was sold by the four biggest auctioneers in the city, more
than double the $92 million they sold in  New York , the second-
largest center, according to Bloomberg News calculations.  Sophisticated Buyers  Robert Sleigh, senior director and head of wine for  Asia  at
Sotheby’s in Hong Kong, says Asian buyers have become more
sophisticated.  “In 2009 and 2010 there was a very frenzied asset grab
situation,” Sleigh said. “Now people are more choosy about
what they buy and how much they will pay.”  After last year’s price declines, there is evidence of a
revival in demand for marquee Bordeaux wines.  “Early signs are that it’s looking a little bit healthier
this month than at the end of last year,” said Jack Hibberd, of
the London-based Liv-ex wine market. “We’ve seen a bit more
first-growth trade.”  The  Sotheby’s  sale on Jan. 14 starts with offerings of
multiple Bordeaux vintages from the past 15 years, including
flagship years from producers such as Lafite,  Chateau Latour ,
Chateau Mouton-Rothschild,  Chateau Margaux  and Haut-Brion. Of
those, the Lafite 1996 and 2005 carry the top estimates at as
much as HK$140,000 a case.  The auction also includes single bottles of Romanee-Conti
1965 and 1978 with top estimates of HK$50,000 and HK$65,000
respectively.  Upper Estimates  Zachys  held its first Hong Kong sale of the year on Jan. 7,
with wine sold totaling HK$34.62 million including a buyer’s
premium. While 97 percent of lots sold and about 250 buyers
attended the event, the top 10 lots fetched less than their
upper estimates, according to results published on its website.  Two lots of 24 half-bottles of Lafite 1982 sold for
HK$207,400 each, while a case of Chateau Ausone 2000 from Saint-
Emilion fetched HK$79,300, all below their estimated range.
Eight bottles of Chateau Lafleur 1982 fetched HK$219,600 and a
case of Petrus 1995 sold for HK$146,400, both within estimates.  Jeannie Cho Lee, a Hong Kong-based Master of Wine, says the
global slowdown will lead to more price cuts. “Given the
uncertain financial markets and news of large bonus cuts and
layoffs, I assume this will continue for the first half,” she
said. “The first quarter of 2012 will be a time to buy wines at
more sensible prices, i.e. at 2010 prices.”  Still, prices for top Burgundies such as DRC and Leroy will
hold strong, she says. “The interest in this category began
just last year and given the scarce supply, this is likely to
continue.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
