Banco Santander SA (SAN)  Chairman  Emilio Botin  lost a bid at Spain’s National Court to block three
groups’ ability to file complaints against him over accusations
he broke national tax laws by hiding funds in  Switzerland .  Appeals by Botin, his brother Jaime Botin and other people
contesting a November decision to allow the complaints by the
three groups were rejected, the Madrid-based court said today in
a ruling sent by e-mail. In Spain, any citizen can make a so-
called popular accusation in legal proceedings even if they are
not directly involved in the matter.  The court said in June it would investigate Botin and 11
family members after tax officials received information on
clients at  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s Swiss private bank from French
authorities. The Botin family, in a statement distributed by
Santander at the time, said it has put its tax affairs in order
“voluntarily,” has met all its tax obligations and hopes the
case will be cleared up in court.  A spokesman for Spain’s largest bank, who asked not to be
identified in line with company policy, declined to comment
today in a phone interview.  The complaints were made by three groups called Ciudadania
Anticorrupcion, Asociacion Contra La Corrupcion Sistemica Y En
Defensa Del Libre Ejercicio De La Acusacion Popular and Manos
Limpias, the court said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
