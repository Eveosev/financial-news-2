U.S. Bank N.A., a  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  unit 
in the role of trustee, filed a lawsuit in  New York  seeking to 
stop a sale related to a mortgage loan on a Honolulu hotel.  The $70 million senior loan is secured by a leasehold
mortgage covering the  Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel  in Honolulu,
which is part of a $1.05 billion pool of commercial real estate
loans that were securitized and sold to investors as bonds,
according to court papers filed today in New York State Supreme
Court in  Manhattan .  The defendant, Petra CRE CDO 2007-1, which is incorporated
in George Town, Grand Cayman, holds a $34.9 million mezzanine
loan that is secured by the membership interests in the borrower
under the $70 million senior loan, according to the lawsuit.  The mezzanine loan is in default and Petra is scheduled to
sell the membership interests on Feb. 15, according to the suit,
which is seeking an injunction preventing the sale.  U.S. Bank
National Association  holds the title to the senior loan and is
represented in the suit by Wells Fargo Bank NA.  Petra CRE CDO 2007-1 is overseen by Petra Capital
Management LLC, the New York-based investment firm led by
commercial-mortgage-bond pioneer Andrew Stone.  Stone declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The suit seeks damages to be determined at trial.  The case is U.S. Bank National Association v. Petra CRE CDO
2007-1, Ltd., 650077/2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
