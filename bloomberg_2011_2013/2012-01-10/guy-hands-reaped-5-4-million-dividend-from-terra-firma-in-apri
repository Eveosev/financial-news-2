Guy Hands reaped a 3.5 million-pound
($5.4 million) dividend from Terra Firma  Capital Partners  Ltd.
two months after the private-equity firm he founded lost control
of record label EMI Group Ltd.  The firm made the payment last April, according to a Jan. 4
filing at the U.K.’s Companies House. That’s down from a 12
million-pound dividend for the year ended March 2010 and none
for the year ended last March, filings show.  Terra Firma, which manages a 5.4 billion-euro ($6.9
billion) leveraged buyout fund, ceded control of EMI to New
York-based  Citigroup Inc. (C)  last February as the record label
struggled to meet the terms of 3.4 billion pounds in loans the
private-equity investor used to fund its takeover in 2007.
Citigroup has since agreed to sell the 114-year-old British
music company in pieces to Vivendi SA and Sony Corp.  Terra Firma Capital Partners posted 2.25 million pounds in
profit on ordinary activities after tax for the year ended March
31, a 3 percent decline compared with the year before. It posted
an 8.7 percent slump in revenue to 29.9 million pounds, the
filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
