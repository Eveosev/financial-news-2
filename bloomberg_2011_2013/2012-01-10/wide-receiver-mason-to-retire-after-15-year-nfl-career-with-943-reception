Derrick Mason is retiring after a
15-year career in which he totaled 943 receptions, the 11th-most
in National Football League history.  Mason, 37, was cut by the  Baltimore Ravens  before this
season to save salary cap space. He joined the  New York Jets  for
five games before being traded to the Houston Texans, who cut
Mason last month after he caught three passes in six games.  “I’m done,” Mason told  profootball.scout.com  in a
telephone interview. “I knew one way to play football, going
all-out and having fun out there.”  Mason said he wants to pursue a broadcasting career and
made appearances on the NFL Network after being cut by Houston.  A two-time Pro Bowl selection, Mason finishes his career
with 12,061 receiving yards and 66 touchdowns. He also totaled
5,086 yards and three touchdowns returning kicks and punts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
