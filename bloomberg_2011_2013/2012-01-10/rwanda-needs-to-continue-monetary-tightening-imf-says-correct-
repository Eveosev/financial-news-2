(Corrects to attribute to International Monetary Fund.)  Rwanda may need to continue monetary
tightening this year “to prevent the erosion of recent gains in
macroeconomic stability,” the International Monetary Fund said.  Economic growth in the East African nation is expected to
slow in 2012 after the country experienced “high growth” in
2011, the fund said. Rwanda will need to enact “structural
reforms” this year to help boost the outlook for economic
growth, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
