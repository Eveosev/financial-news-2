Home-video spending by U.S.
consumers stalled in the final three months of 2011, leading to
the seventh straight annual decline in spending on products such
as DVDs and movie rentals.  Total spending rose 0.6 percent in the second half of the
year, the industry-backed  Digital Entertainment Group  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That included a 5 percent gain in the
third quarter, suggesting a slower holiday season.  Spending for the year fell 2.1 percent to $18 billion, the
DEG said. The decline was led by shrinking rentals from stores,
where revenue fell 29 percent and fewer DVD sales, the group
said. Blu-ray disc sales rose 20 percent to $2 billion, the DEG
said. Total spending on packaged videos fell 13 percent for
2011, suggesting DVDs purchases shrank by about 20 percent.  The DEG didn’t break down the packaged goods category and
didn’t supply fourth-quarter industry data. Joanna Sulakhyan,
the group’s manager, didn’t immediately respond to phone calls
seeking comment.  Subscription disc and kiosk rentals, such as those provided
by  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  and  Coinstar Inc. (CSTR) ’s Redbox, were bright spots,
rising 4.1 percent and 31 percent last year, respectively.
Electronic sell-through rose 9 percent for the year and video on
demand increased 6.7 percent, the DEG said.  Subscription streaming, which Netflix also provides,
generated $993.6 million in 2011 revenue, the DEG said. A year-
earlier figure wasn’t available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
