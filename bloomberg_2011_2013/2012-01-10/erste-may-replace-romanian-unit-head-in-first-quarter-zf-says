Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  may replace
Dominic Bruynseels, the chief executive officer of its Romanian
unit Banca Comerciala Romana SA, by the end of the first
quarter, Ziarul Financiar reported today, citing unidentified
bank industry people.  Bruynseels, whose four-year chief executive term ends in
August, will probably be replaced with another international
banker, the newspaper said, quoting the unnamed people.  Banca Comerciala Romana doesnâ€™t comment on rumors, said
Ionut Stanimir, a spokesman for the Bucharest-based bank, when
contacted by Bloomberg News by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
