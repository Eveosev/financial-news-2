Affichage Holding SA (AFFN)  sold its 85
percent stake in Bozen, Italy-based First Avenue GmbH to the
existing minority shareholder, the Swiss company said.  “As planned, therefore, it is withdrawing from this
region,” Affichage said in an e-mailed statement today. The
Zurich-based billboard-advertising company said the sale is part
of its plan to scale back its international portfolio and focus
on its core Swiss business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
