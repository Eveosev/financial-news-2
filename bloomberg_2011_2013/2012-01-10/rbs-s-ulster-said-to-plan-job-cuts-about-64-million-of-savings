Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s
Irish unit is preparing its second round of job cuts in four
years as part of an effort to save about 50 million euros ($63.9
million), according to two people with knowledge of the plan.  Dublin-based  Ulster Bank Ltd. , which eliminated 1,000 jobs
in 2009, or about one-seventh of its workforce, plans to make an
announcement tomorrow as its Edinburgh-based parent also unveils
restructuring measures, said the people, who declined to be
identified as the talks aren’t yet complete. Not all of the
savings will come from eliminating jobs, one of the people said.  “The likely announcement from Ulster highlights the
difficult income trends facing the Irish banks in the coming
years,”  Eamonn Hughes , an analyst at Dublin-based  Goodbody
Stockbrokers , said in a note today. A 50 million-euro savings
figure equates to about 8 percent of the Irish lender’s
estimated 2011 costs, he said.  Ulster Bank , where assets doubled to 55 billion pounds
($85.1 billion) in the four years through the 2007 peak of the
Irish real-estate market, took a cumulative 7.5 percent
impairment charge against its loans between 2008 and 2010,
according to a  report  published last month by the U.K. Financial
Services Authority. RBS, controlled by the British government,
has injected about 6.7 billion euros into Ulster Bank since 2008
amid mounting losses, according to filings and press reports.  Announcement Tomorrow  An RBS official in  London  declined to comment. Tomorrow,
the bank will announce plans to close its equities and corporate
finance units globally, cutting as many as 5,000 jobs, two
people familiar with the situation have previously said.  Ulster Bank Chief Executive  Jim Brown , who took over in
April from Cormac McCarthy, said in an interview with the Irish
Times in October that he “wouldn’t rule out job losses, but it
is not something we have formed a view on.”  RBS acquired Ulster Bank in 2000 as part of its purchase of
National Westminster Bank Plc and expanded three years later
through the acquisition of First Active Plc, Ireland’s oldest
building society. Ulster Bank’s operating loss widened to 761
million pounds in 2010 from 368 million pounds in 2009.  RBS pumped about 2.7 billion euros of capital into Ulster
Bank up to the end of 2009, according to records in Dublin’s
Company Registration Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
