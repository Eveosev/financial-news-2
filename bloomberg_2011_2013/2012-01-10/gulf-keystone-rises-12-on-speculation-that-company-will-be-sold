Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP) , an oil
and natural-gas explorer in the Kurdistan region of northern
Iraq, rose to a record after the company said the regional
government there has the right to buy some of its acreage.  Shares climbed 21 percent to close at 266.75 pence in
London, the highest since listing in 2004.  Gulf Keystone said today that the Kurdistan regional
government has the right to buy into the Shaikan and Akri-Bijeel
blocks. The Daily Mail newspaper reported speculation the
Bermuda-based company will be taken over had been revived. Gulf
Keystone denied last month it was in talks with  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)   “Gulf Keystone will sell up, that’s the consensus,” said
Alex Ogbechie, an oil analyst at Fox-Davies Capital Ltd. in
 London . “It’s just a matter of time. The agreement on
provisions of the contracts makes investors a bit more
comfortable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
