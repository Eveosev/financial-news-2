Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s biggest oil
and natural-gas producer, will raise research and development
spending 27 percent to 2.8 billion kroner ($468 million) this
year to help the company meet a 2020 target for output gains.  The investment will allow Statoil to cut the time taken to
build wells by 30 percent and costs by 15 percent by 2020, the
Stavanger, Norway-based company said in a statement. It will
also improve so-called reservoir characterization or modeling,
adding about 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves.  Statoil plans to expand production to 2.5 million barrels
of oil equivalent a day in 2020, compared with 1.9 million in
2010. Its ambitions were bolstered with the announcement of a
find yesterday that may hold 200 million to 300 million barrels
at the Havis prospect in the  Barents Sea , about 7 kilometers
(4.4 miles) southwest of Skrugard, a find discovered in April.  The company will focus on increasing rates of discovery and
recovery, lowering well construction costs and improving the
capability of subsea compression, said Magareth Oevrum, head of
Technology, Projects and Drilling, in an interview in Oslo.
Subsea compression is used to maintain pressure and output.  “We will find the resources of the future at great oceanic
depths, in Arctic areas where the conditions are extreme,”
Oevrum said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
