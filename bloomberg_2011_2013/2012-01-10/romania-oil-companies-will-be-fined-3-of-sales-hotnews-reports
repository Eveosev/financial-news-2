Romania â€™s competition council will
fine  oil companies  including  OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  and Rompetrol Group
NV sums equivalent to 3 percent of their total sales for
breaching antitrust rules,  Hotnews  reported, citing unidentified
people familiar with the matter.  The regulator will apply the same formula in fining the
Romanian units of  Lukoil OAO (LKOD) ,  MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas Plc  and
 ENI SpA (ENI) , the online news service reported. The regulator is
likely to announce the results of an investigation of the fuel
market today.  The companies are being probed in connection with the
withdrawal from the market of Eco-Premium, an unleaded gasoline
pre-mixed with lead substitute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
