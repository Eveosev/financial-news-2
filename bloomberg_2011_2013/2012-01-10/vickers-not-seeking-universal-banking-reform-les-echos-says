John Vickers , head of the U.K.’s
independent banking commission which drafted proposals for banks
to separate investment and consumer businesses, is not urging
other countries to take similar measures, he told  Les Echos  in
an interview.  Vickers, who is meeting French bankers in Paris this week,
told the newspaper he was not seeking a “universal
prescription” for bank reform. His panel’s recommendations led
the U.K. government to say it will make banks build firewalls
between their consumer and investment banks and boost the amount
of loss-absorbing equity and debt they hold.  Vickers told  Les Echos  those recommendations responded to
“the specifics of the British banking system” and might not be
suitable for banks in other countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
