Iceland has hired lawyer Tim Ward of
Monckton Chambers to defend it in a lawsuit by a European agency
for failing to compensate the U.K. and Dutch governments for
depositor losses stemming from the collapse of  Landsbanki
Islands hf .  The European Free Trade Association’s Surveillance
Authority announced on Dec. 14 that it was taking Iceland to the
 EFTA Court  in Luxembourg for its failure to comply with
obligations under the European Economic Area Agreement.  U.K. and Dutch depositors were compensated by their
governments after Landsbanki’s 2008 failure left their savings
in limbo. Iceland said in September that proceeds from the
estate of Landsbanki will reach about $11 billion, enough to
cover all depositor losses, and about twice the amount owed
under the depositor guarantee directive. Landsbanki’s winding-up
committee said Dec. 7 it made a first payment of 432 billion
kronur ($3.5 billion) toward reducing its obligations.  Iceland is obligated under European rules to guarantee
minimum compensation of 20,000 euros ($25,560) to Dutch and
British holders of Landsbanki’s high-yielding Icesave accounts,
according to the free-trade authority, which monitors the extent
to which Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein follow European
rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
