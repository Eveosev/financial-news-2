Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  is
close to settling some claims by U.S. prosecutors in a lawsuit
accusing the bank of overcharging customers for foreign-exchange
trading, according to a court filing.  U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in  Manhattan  requested a one-
week extension for BNY Mellon to respond to the complaint
because the two sides “are presently close to reaching an
agreement that would resolve certain claims,” according to a
letter filed yesterday with U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan.
The judge granted the request, according to the court docket.  Bharara sued New York-based BNY Mellon on Oct. 4, the same
day the bank was sued by  New York  Attorney General  Eric Schneiderman  for allegedly defrauding public pension funds of $2
billion over 10 years. Attorneys general in Virginia and Florida
and some California counties filed similar complaints.  The cases center on the pricing of small foreign-exchange
transactions handled automatically by the custody banks on
behalf of pension funds, a service known as standing
instruction. In some of the cases the banks have said they acted
as a principal, selling one currency for another in arms-length
transactions at a set price that customers were free to accept
or reject.  Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, declined to
comment on the government’s court filing.  The case is U.S. v. The  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) ,
11-6969, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
