Sony Corp. (SNE) ’s Kazuo Hirai said the
PlayStation 3 console will have a 10-year lifespan, suggesting
the 5-year-old video-game player won’t be replaced soon.  Networks can’t deliver the full amount of data contained on
game disks, Hirai, Sony’s executive deputy president, said at
the  Consumer Electronics Show  in  Las Vegas .  “It’s very important that we continue to have a dedicated
home-based console,” Hirai said. “Relying solely on networks
to deliver content is unfortunately just not possible. It’s
still very difficult to have consumers download 50 gigabytes of
data or more.”  The PlayStation 3 was introduced in November 2006. Some
press reports suggested a new version would be unveiled at this
year’s E3 video-game conference.  Hirai also told CNBC that turning around Sony’s money-
losing TV manufacturing operation is crucial to company
profitability. In December, Tokyo-based Sony sold its stake in a
liquid-crystal-display venture with Samsung Electronics Co.  Sony is considering developing exclusive shows for its
devices, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Howard Stringer 
said today in a separate interview.  “It’s coming,”  Stringer said. “It’s natural.”  U.S. traded Sony shares gained 1.3 percent to $17.70 at the
close. The stock  fell  49 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
