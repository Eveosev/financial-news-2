Zimbabwe  planted 247,000 hectares
(610,350 acres) of corn from November to January, down from
379,993 hectares in same period a year earlier as a result of
late rains, Agricultural Extension Services said.  The country’s farmers planted 130,944 hectares of sorghum
and other small grains, compared with 136,131 hectares, the
government organization, known as Agritex, said in a crop report
handed out in Harare, the capital.  “It looks like this year is going to be a bad year, in
terms of crop output,” Seiso Moyo, the deputy agriculture
minister, said in a phone interview from his office in Harare.
“We will inform government at the end of this month or early
next month on what needs to be done, but indications are that it
will not be a good year.”  The  United Nations   said  Dec. 9 it was seeking $268 million
to help feed as many as 1.45 million people in the country this
year.  Cotton planting also decreased from last season. A total of
45,000 hectares were planted, compared with 107,727 hectares
last season. Farmers planted soybeans on 5,079 hectares compared
with 13,674 hectares, and tobacco on 39,393 hectares compared
with 43,545 hectares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
