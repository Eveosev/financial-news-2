Vietnam ’s bonds gained, pushing
yields to a three-week low, on speculation large banks have
surplus funds to purchase government debt. The dong was steady.  The central bank continued to increase liquidity in the
banking system by injecting a net 10.3 trillion dong ($490
million) into the market via open-market operations since the
beginning of the month, Viet Capital Securities Joint-Stock Co.
wrote in a research note yesterday.  “Big banks still have a lot of surplus cash, so they are
buying bonds,” said Nguyen Tuan Phong, the Hanoi-based fixed-
income manager at Bao Viet Fund Management Co., a unit of
Vietnam’s biggest insurer.  The  yield  on the benchmark five-year note declined seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 12.47 percent, the
lowest level since Dec. 20, according to a daily fixing from
banks compiled by Bloomberg. The dong was little changed at
21,035 per dollar as of 4:11 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
