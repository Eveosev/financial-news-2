Honda Motor Co. (7267) , seeking to revive
U.S. sales after production delays and unfavorable reviews for
some new products, plans to boost Accord sales by more than 27
percent this year with a revamped version of the midsize model.  “The plan is to do at least 300,000 this year,” John Mendel, executive vice president of Tokyo-based Honda’s U.S.
sales unit, told reporters today at the Detroit auto show.  The 2013 Accord will be the first U.S. model to be equipped
with the company’s newest generation of engines, U.S. sales
chief John Mendel said at the Detroit auto show today. This year
“Honda is back at full power, firing on all cylinders.”  Honda, along with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , lost sales last year
to  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and Kia Motors Corp., as well as to
revitalized U.S.-based  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
Deliveries of the midsize Accord, Honda’s top-selling U.S.
model, fell 17 percent last year to 235,625.  The company, Japan’s third-largest automaker, today showed
a concept version of the new Accord coupe that goes on sale in
the second half of the year. Accord will be the first U.S. model
to receive Honda’s new four- and six-cylinder engines.  Mendel said the new engines will give Honda the best fuel
efficiency in every model category.  Yesterday, Mendel said more than half of the 700,000
Accords to be sold worldwide this year would probably be in the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
