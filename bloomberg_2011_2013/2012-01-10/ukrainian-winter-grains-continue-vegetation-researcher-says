Ukrainian winter grains continued
vegetation after warm weather and an absence of snow in
December, making them more vulnerable to possible frosts,
UkrAgroConsult said.  Plants are wasting nutrients accumulated earlier, curbing
their resistance to low temperatures, the Kiev-based
agricultural researcher said today in an e-mailed statement.
Crops will survive the winter successfully in the absence of
severe frosts or the formation of an ice crust, it said.  Winter grains, comprised mostly of wheat, sprouted on 83
percent of planted areas, or 6.9 million hectares (17 million
acres), as of Jan. 5, the  Agriculture Ministry  said in a 
statement  on its website. Plants were in good condition on 1.8
million hectares and classified as weak on 2.3 million hectares
and satisfactory elsewhere, the statement showed.  Ukrainian 2012 winter-grain plantings rose 3.8 percent to
8.39 million hectares, according to the state statistics office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
