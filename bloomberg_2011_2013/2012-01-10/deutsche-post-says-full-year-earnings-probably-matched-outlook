Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ,  Europe ’s largest
postal service, probably met its earnings forecast for 2011 as
mail volume stabilized and parcel and freight shipments
increased, according to an online presentation.  The company reiterated that earnings before interest and
taxes last year would exceed 2.4 billion euros ($3.06 billion),
according to the  presentation  by Chief Financial Officer Larry
Rosen to investors in  New York . The company’s DHL express and
cargo division expects growth through 2015 as it serves growing
markets in Asia, Rosen said.  The company, which is based in Bonn, raised its forecast in
November as deliveries increased, partly because of growth in
online retail sales.  Germany ’s parcel market will probably rise
by an average 5 percent through 2020 as consumers order more
retail items over the Internet, Rosen said in the presentation.
About 50 percent of DHL’s shipments involve  Asia , a region with
“double-digit volume growth,” he said.  Deutsche Post  rose  as much as 2.8 percent to 12.44 euros,
the biggest intraday jump since Dec. 20, and was up 2.4 percent
at 9:17 a.m. in Frankfurt. That pared the stock’s decline in the
past 12 months to 3.7 percent.  The company is scheduled to release full 2011 figures on
March 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
