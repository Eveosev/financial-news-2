More than 38 million U.S. adults, or
17.1 percent of the population, indulged in binge drinking four
times a month or more in 2010, led by members of households with
incomes of $75,000 or more, federal health officials said.  Wisconsin had both the highest percentage of binge
drinkers, with 25.6 percent of the population reporting they
engaged, and the most-intense sessions, with an average of nine
drinks, according to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The nation’s capital reported 21.9
percent of its population was binge-drinkers, tying it with
 North Dakota  for third highest in a survey covering the  District
of Columbia  and 48 of the 50 states.  Binge drinking, defined as four or more drinks for women
and five or more drinks for men in a period of  about 2 hours , is
the third-most-common cause of preventable death in the U.S.,
with 80,000 annual fatalities,  according to the CDC . Alcohol
intoxication increases the risk of traffic accidents, falls,
drownings and burns, as well as domestic violence and risky
sexual behavior.  “We’re talking about a risk behavior that’s quite
widespread in the population,” said Robert Brewer, an
epidemiologist at the CDC, in a conference call with reporters.
“And where people have the impression it’s not such a bad thing
to do.”  Those who binged most often were at least 65 years old,
with 5.5 events a month, the Atlanta-based agency reported.
Twenty-eight percent of people ages 18 to 24 binged, consuming
about 9.3 drinks an episode.  Government Recommendations  The CDC recommends women have no more than one drink a day
and men no more than two. One drink is the equivalent of 12
ounces of beer, 8 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or
1.5 ounces of liquor, according to the  CDC’s website.  Most
people who binge drink aren’t alcoholics, the agency said.  About 20 percent of those whose households made more than
$75,000 were binge drinkers, the highest overall prevalence.
People from households making less than $25,000 who did binge
imbibed more often, with about five episodes a month and 8.5
drinks on each occasion.  Today’s data came from self-reported incidents within the
last 30 days for 458,000 U.S. adults. It was part of the
Atlanta-based agency’s 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System.  People binged most often in  Kentucky , reporting engaging in
the behavior an average of 5.9 times a month.  Data weren’t available from  South Dakota  and  Tennessee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
