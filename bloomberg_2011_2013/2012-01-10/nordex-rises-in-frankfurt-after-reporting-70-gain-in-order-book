Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind-turbine
maker, rose the most since October in Frankfurt trading after
reporting a 70 percent increase in the value of its order book
as U.S. deals jumped at the end of 2011.  The  stock  climbed 7.4 percent, the biggest one-day gain
since Oct. 24, to close at 4.22 euros. Orders totaled about 700
million euros ($895 million) at the start of 2012, up from 411
million euros a year earlier, Nordex said today in a statement.  The Hamburg-based turbine maker has benefited from wind-
power investment in the U.S., where it won a contract from BayWa
AG to supply a 30-megawatt project in  Texas  in December. Growth
in  North America  will help boost revenue at Nordex, which cut
2011 sales and earnings forecasts in November as the European
debt crisis restricted  project financing  and delayed orders.  Contracts in the U.S., where project developers raced to
secure cash grants from the government before they ran out at
the end of 2011, accounted for almost half of Nordex’s orders in
the fourth quarter, Ralf Peters, a company spokesman, said today
by telephone.  The order intake grew to 1.1 billion euros last year from
836 million euros in 2010, ahead of Nordex’s forecast for 1
billion euros. European markets accounted for 77 percent of the
intake, with U.S. sales making up 21 percent, or 191 million
euros, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
