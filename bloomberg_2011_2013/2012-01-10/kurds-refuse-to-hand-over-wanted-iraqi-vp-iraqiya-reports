The government of Iraq’s semi-
autonomous Kurdistan region declined to detain Iraqi Vice
President Tariq al-Hashimi in line with an arrest warrant from
central authorities, Iraqiya reported.  Kurdistan is “not bound” by the arrest warrant issued by
the federal government, said Fayeq Tawfiq, the Kurdish
administration’s deputy interior minister. Iraq’s government had
officially asked the Kurdistan authorities two days ago to hand
over al-Hashimi and 14 aides to face trial on terrorism charges
in  Baghdad , according to state-run Iraqiya.  Hashimi left Baghdad for Erbil in the Kurdistan region
after an arrest warrant was issued against him. Iraqiya aired
alleged confessions by his bodyguards saying that they committed
murder at his request in return for money. Hashimi said the
confessions were fabricated and asked to be tried in Kurdistan.  The arrest warrants mark an escalation of tensions between
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s Shiite Muslim-led allies and
Sunni Muslim politicians, such as al-Hashimi, who have been at
odds for more than a year over the formation of a unity
government. The infighting comes as the U.S. pulled out its
troops at the end of last month from  Iraq  which is seeking
investments to develop the world’s fifth-largest crude reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
