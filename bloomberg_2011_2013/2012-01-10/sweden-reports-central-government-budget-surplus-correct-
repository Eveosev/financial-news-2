Sweden posted a surplus last year
because of higher tax receipts, lower  unemployment  benefit
payouts and asset sales, the  Swedish National Debt Office  said.  The country posted a 68 billion kronor ($9.8 billion)
surplus, in line with the debt office’s 69 billion kronor
forecast, the Stockholm-based agency said in a statement today.
This reduced total central government debt to 32 percent of
gross domestic product, the agency said.  “Despite increased concerns about the debt situation in
the world and an expected slowdown in the economy during the
second half, Swedish government finances developed strongly in
2011,” the debt office said.  Sweden’s economy  expanded faster than most analysts
estimated in the third quarter as exports picked up and
companies continued investing. Finance Minister Anders Borg has
said the government stands ready to add stimulus to help growth.  The government sold shares in state assets for 23 billion
kronor last year, the debt office said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
