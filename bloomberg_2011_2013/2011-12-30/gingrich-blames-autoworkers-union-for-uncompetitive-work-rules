Former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , at a campaign stop today in Des Moines, Iowa, blamed
the United Auto Workers union for hindering U.S. manufacturing.  In response to a question about jobs leaving the U.S.,
Gingrich, who faces his first test as a candidate for the
Republican presidential nomination in the Iowa caucuses Jan. 3,
touched on the automotive industry.  “We have a very vibrant auto industry in places like BMW,
which now manufactures in the U.S. and exports worldwide,” he
said, before naming some other automakers with nonunion plants
assembling vehicles in the U.S. “Mercedes, Honda, Nissan.
Where it’s a real problem is the UAW.”  The UAW represents hourly workers at  General Motors Co. (GM) ,
 Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S. automaker
majority-owned by  Fiat SpA. (F)   Michele Martin , a spokeswoman for
the Detroit-based union, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking a comment.  “It’s a work-rules problem; it’s not an hourly cost
problem,” he told a Rotary Club breakfast meeting. “You can’t
have continuous improvement if you’re not allowed to constantly
modify and improve.”  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , based in Munich, makes cars
and sport-utility vehicles in  South Carolina , and Stuttgart,
Germany-based  Daimler AG (DAI)  assembles Mercedes-Benz vehicles in
Alabama. Tokyo-based Honda Motor Co. has vehicle plants in Ohio,
Indiana and Alabama, while Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan Motor
Co. has assembly plants in the Tennessee and Mississippi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
