Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
biggest wind turbine maker, received 259 megawatts of orders in
six countries, according to statements on the company website.  Arise Windpower AB (AWP)  and Platina Partners LLP made the
biggest order announced today, for 23 turbines totaling 69
megawatts in Jadraas,  Sweden . Electricite de  France  SA made two
orders totaling 62 megawatts for projects in Italy and  Germany ,
and Vestas also won a 50-megawatt contract from Zorlu Energy
Group in  Pakistan , its first deal in the Asian nation.  “This milestone puts Vestas in an advantageous position to
encourage and support the development of wind power in this
country going forward,” Sean Sutton, president of Vestas Asia
Pacific, said in the statement, referring to the Pakistani deal.  Today’s projects bring Vestas’s orders for 2011 to 6,194
megawatts, excluding unannounced deals from the fourth quarter.
Short-selling of shares in Vestas rose to the highest in more
than five years this week on speculation the Aarhus, Denmark-
based company won’t meet its 2011 guidance for 7,000 megawatts
to 8,000 megawatts of orders.  Vestas has now published details of more than 500 megawatts
of orders in the last two working days of 2011, after saying
yesterday it got a 254-megawatt deal with  CPFL Energia SA (CPFE3)  in
 Brazil .  Orderbooks Due  Vestas is due to announce full-year orders data, including
unannounced contracts from the final quarter, on Feb. 8. It
needs at least 806 megawatts to meet guidance. Spokesman Peter Kruse said two days ago in a phone interview that Vestas expects
to make the target.  The other deals announced today by Vestas are a 54-megawatt
order from an unnamed client in the U.K., and a 24-megawatt
order from VSB Energies Nouvelles in France.  Short sellers borrow stocks and sell them in the
anticipation of profiting by repurchasing the securities later
at a lower price.  Short positions (VWS)  in Vestas reached 17.3 percent
as of Dec. 27, the highest in more than five years according to
figures on Bloomberg compiled by Data Explorers Inc.  Vestas today closed up 4.9 percent at 62 kroner in
Copenhagen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
