Bolton has agreed on a transfer fee
with Chelsea for  Gary Cahill , Wanderers manager Owen Coyle said.  Cahill’s contract expires after this season and the England
defender was linked with a move from Bolton during the summer.
His agent must now work out a contract with the Blues.  “Bolton Wanderers and Chelsea, have at this moment in time
agreed a fee for Gary,” Coyle said on Bolton’s website. “Now
it is up to Gary’s representatives to speak to Chelsea.”  The  Daily Telegraph  reported the teams agreed on a 7
million-pound ($10.9 million) fee for the 26-year-old.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
