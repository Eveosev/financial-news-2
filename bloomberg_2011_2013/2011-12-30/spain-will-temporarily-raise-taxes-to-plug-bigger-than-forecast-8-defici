Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy ’s government plans to temporarily raise tax on income,
savings and high-value homes after the euro-region’s third-
biggest budget deficit topped forecasts for this year.  The government will raise the levies for two years in a bid
to move the deficit toward the euro-region limit of 3 percent of
gross domestic product. The deficit this year will reach 8
percent, more than the 6 percent forecast by the outgoing
government that Rajoy unseated in Nov. 20 general elections,
said government spokeswoman Soraya Saenz de Santamaria at a
press conference in  Madrid .  To contact the reporter on this story:
