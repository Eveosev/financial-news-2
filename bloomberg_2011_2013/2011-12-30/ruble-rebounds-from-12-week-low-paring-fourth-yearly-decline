 The ruble appreciated for the first
day in four, rising from its weakest level against the dollar in
12 weeks and trimming its fourth consecutive yearly drop, as oil
headed for a third yearly increase.  The Russian currency strengthened 0.3 percent to 32.1475
against the dollar at end of trading in Moscow, rebounding from
its weakest closing level since Oct. 6 and trimming the weekly
drop to 2.9 percent. The ruble depreciated 0.4 percent to
41.7375 versus the euro, bringing the week’s drop to 2.6
percent.  Crude headed for a third annual increase amid speculation
escalating tension in the  Middle East  may disrupt supplies. Oil
for February delivery slipped 1 cent to $99.64 a barrel at 10:16
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It has advanced 9
percent this year.  The ruble weakened in the final week of each year since
2008 as traders are closing their positions ahead of the
country’s New Year and Christmas national holidays that run
between Jan. 1 and Jan. 9. The ruble and stocks trading in
Moscow resumes Jan. 3.  Russia’s dollar-denominated Eurobonds due in 2020 fell,
pushing the yield four basis points, or 0.04 percentage points,
higher to 4.562 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
