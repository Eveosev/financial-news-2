The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
declined for a third day, extending its first annual fall since
2008.  The index dropped 10.20, or less than 0.1 percent, to
31,985.67 at the noon close in Johannesburg, a decline of 0.4
percent this year.  The following are among the active equities in the South
African market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, gained for the first time in three days, adding
1.6 percent to 343.40 rand. Gold, poised for an 11th year of
advance, rebounded from the lowest level in six months as a
slump that threatened to tip the metal into a bear market
spurred purchases, tempering the effect of a stronger dollar.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd. (HAR)  , South Africa’s
third-largest gold producer, climbed 0.3 percent to 95.00 rand.
 DRDGold Ltd. (DRD)  advanced 2 percent to 4.60 rand.  Beige Holdings Ltd. (BEG)  , a cosmetics maker, had its
biggest gain since June 30 after saying Lion Match Co. (Pty)
Ltd. had acquired a controlling stake and would make a mandatory
offer to other shareholders. Beige stock jumped 29 percent to 9
cents.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , which provides 40 percent of South
Africa’s motor fuel, increased for a second day, rising 1.2
percent to 385.50 rand. Oil rose for a second day, heading for a
third annual increase, on speculation escalating tension in the
Middle East may disrupt supplies as a recovery in the  U.S.
economy  bolsters demand.  -- Editors: Ash Kumar, Hilton Shone  To contact the reporter on this story:
