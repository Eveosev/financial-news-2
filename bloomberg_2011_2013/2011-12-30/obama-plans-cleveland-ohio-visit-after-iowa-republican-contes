President  Barack Obama  plans to
visit  Cleveland ,  Ohio , on Jan. 4, the day after Iowa Republicans
hold the country’s first contest for their party’s 2012
presidential nomination.  Obama will make the economy the focus of his remarks,
according to White House spokesman  Josh Earnest . Democrat Obama
won Ohio in the 2008 election. It is the home state of
Republican House Speaker  John Boehner  and no Republican has ever
won the White House without winning Ohio.  Ohio has picked the winner in every election since 1960,
when Republican  Richard Nixon  won Ohio and lost the national
election to Democrat  John F. Kennedy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
