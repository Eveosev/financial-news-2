Kenya ’s shilling weakened against
the dollar for a fourth day, increasing its year-to-date decline
to 5.6 percent, on limited trading.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.3 percent to 85.25 shillings as of 2:04 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, the lowest since Dec. 14 on an intraday basis,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The euro weakened for a
second day against the  U.S. dollar , declining 0.02 percent to
1.2942.  “The market has weakened on thin trading because most
players are out,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi-based
 NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , said by phone today. “The euro has also
weakened, dragging the shilling along”.  Kenya’s shilling has appreciated 20.4 percent since
weakening to a record intra-day low of 106.75 on Oct. 11. The
central bank has taken steps to stabilize the currency,
including raising the key lending rate to 18 percent.  The Tanzanian shilling snapped three days of gains and
weakened 0.3 percent to 1,583 per dollar as of 1:03 p.m.,
heading for its biggest decline in four days and a 6.7 percent
fall this year.  “The shilling depreciated as commercial banks purchased
dollars in the  interbank market ,” Fred Siwale, a dealer with
CRDB Bank Plc, said by phone from Dar-es-Salaam, the commercial
capital.  The Ugandan shilling snapped two days of decline, gaining
0.1 percent against the dollar to 2,483 as of 1:11 p.m. A close
at this level would be the biggest gain since Dec. 27, pairing
its fall this year to 7.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
