Turkey ’s  trade defici (TUTBALBN) t narrowed from
a year earlier to $7.5 billion in November, the first annual
contraction in two years, as export growth outpaced imports.  The deficit compared with a revised $7.8 billion in
November 2010, the statistics office in Ankara said on its
website today. The last time the gap narrowed was in October
2009. The figure was less than the median estimate of $7.9
billion from four analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Turkey’s central bank and government are seeking to slow
imports through curbs on loan growth and boost exports to tackle
a  current account deficit (TUCALNEW)  that widened to a record 10 percent of
economic output. Concern about the deficit brought losses of 19
percent for the lira this year, the worst performance among
emerging market currencies.  Exports rose 19 percent to $11.1 billion, outpacing an 8.8
percent expansion in imports to $18.6 billion, the office said.  The lira rose less than 0.1 percent to 1.9162 per dollar at
10:11 a.m. in Istanbul. The main  ISE National 100 (XU100)  share index
gained 0.3 percent to 52,204.96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
