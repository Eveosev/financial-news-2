Brazil’s oil regulator fined  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  for the third time for not properly managing an offshore
oil field that leaked last month.  Chevron didn’t comply with the development plan for the
Frade oil field off the coast of Brazil, the Agencia Nacional do
Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis, known as ANP, said on
its website today. The company didn’t have the proper measures
in place to protect the reservoir at a well that leaked about
3,000 barrels of oil, the ANP said.  Chevron will analyze the allegations cited in the ANP’s
notification,  Scott Walker , a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said in an e-mail. Chevron followed
the oil industry’s best practices and acted “within the plan of
development approved by ANP,” Walker said.  The ANP didn’t specify the amount of the fine. The
regulator took action against Chevron in November for not
complying with a plan to close down the well and not providing
complete videos of the  oil spill . Each of the first two fines
may be as much as 50 million reais ($26 million,) Magda Chambriard, a director at the ANP, said Nov 22.  ANP officials weren’t available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
