U.S. stocks fell, leaving the
Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (MXEF)  virtually unchanged in 2011 after
one of the most volatile years in the market’s history, as
concern about Europe’s debt crisis halted a two-year rally in
equities. The euro weakened and Treasuries gained.  The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent today to close at 1,257.60 at
4 p.m. in New York, compared with its 2010 closing level of
1,257.64 and marking the smallest annual change since 1947. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 69.48 points, or 0.6 percent,
to 12,217.56 to trim its yearly gain to 5.5 percent. The euro
slipped 0.1 percent to $1.2944 and slid below 100 yen for the
first time in a decade. Ten-year Treasury yields lost two basis
points to 1.88 percent. The S&P GSCI  Index (SHCOMP)  of raw materials
retreated 0.1 percent.  Indexes of stocks and commodities had the worst yearly
returns since the U.S. financial crisis in 2008, while
Treasuries capped their biggest gains since then. The euro had
its first back-to-back annual losses versus the dollar in a
decade.  Spain  said today it will cut spending and raise taxes to
slash a  budget deficit  that will exceed its target, highlighting
the risks to growth from measures meant to tame Europe’s debt
crisis.  “Spain’s numbers show that it’s very difficult to have
strong economic performance while you’re trying to deleverage,”
 Kevin Shacknofsky , who helps manage about $5 billion for Alpine
 Mutual Funds  in New York, said in a telephone interview. “The
U.S. economic data has been experiencing some bounce in the last
quarter. The negative is still Europe.”  Global equity markets lost $6.3 trillion in value this year
as the debt crisis and slowing global economic expansion weighed
on demand for riskier assets.  Volatile Year  The  S&P 500  started the year with a rally, rising as much
as 8.4 percent to a three-year high by the end of April and
extending its rebound from a March 2009 bear-market low to 102
percent. The index tumbled throughout the summer as Congress and
President  Barack Obama  struggled over U.S. deficit cuts, and
sank further amid concern that Europe’s debt crisis was
threatening the global economic recovery. The S&P 500 fell as
much as 19 percent from April to its low for the year on Oct. 3.  Data signaling that the world’s largest economy was
weathering Europe’s crisis helped the market rebound. The U.S.
unemployment rate fell to 8.6 percent in November, the lowest
since March 2009, after lingering at 9 percent or above for
seven straight months.  The  Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (CESIUSD)  for the U.S., which
measures the rate at which data is beating or missing
economists’ estimates, reached a record 97.5 in March before
slumping to a two-year low of minus 117.2 in June. The index has
since rebounded and rose as high as 85.7 this month.  Top 10 Returns  The S&P 500 had fluctuated above and below its 2010 closing
level since the end of October. The S&P 500 and Dow were still
both among the 10 best yearly returns among 91 national equity
indexes tracked by Bloomberg. Benchmark indexes advanced in only
one of 24 developed markets this year, with the 0.6 percent
advance in Ireland’s ISEQ Overall Index the only gauge topping
the S&P 500.  The Dow alternated between gains and losses of more than
400 points on four days for the first time ever in August. Daily
share swings in the S&P 500 averaged 2.2 percent that month, the
most for any August since 1932, Bloomberg data show. The index
moved an average 1.9 percent a day from May through the end of
the year, more than triple the 50-year average of 0.6 percent
before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.  Yearly Losses  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose 0.9 percent today to trim
its 2011 loss to 11 percent. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index slid 17
percent this year and the MSCI All-Country World Index fell 9.4
percent. Each gauge dropped on a yearly basis for the first time
since 2008.  The European benchmark index’s retreat in 2011 was led by a
32 percent drop in banks, the worst performance among 19
industry groups. Financials also were the worst performers in
the S&P 500 this year, down 18 percent as a group, with Bank of
America Corp. losing 59 percent to lead declines.  “I think the key to 2012 is what happens with the
financials,”  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage $23.5 billion at
Security Global Investors in Irvington,  New York , said in a
phone interview. “They’ve been underperforming for so long,
does this group finally start to participate in the market, or
does it continue to underperform? That’s going to go a long way
to determining what kind of year we have because it’s a big
sector.”  Treasury Rally  Two-year Treasury yields fell three basis point today to
0.24 percent and 30-year yields decreased one basis point to
2.90 percent. Treasuries rose this year as investors sought the
relative safety of U.S. government bonds on concern the euro-
region debt crisis will worsen.  U.S. debt  has returned 9.6 percent in 2011, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch data, even after S&P cut the
nation’s AAA rating on Aug. 5. German bunds also gained 9.6
percent, Japanese bonds advanced 2.1 percent and U.S. corporate
debt rallied 7.3 percent. Treasuries beat stocks, commodities
and the dollar for the year, even as reports indicate the  U.S.
economy  is recovering.  Italian 10-year bond yields added eight basis points to
7.11 percent today, holding above the 7 percent level that
foreshadowed bailouts of  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal . The debt
had its worst year since at least 1992. French 10-year rates
climbed six basis points to 3.15 percent, after the nation said
it will sell bonds maturing between 2021 and 2041 on Jan. 5.  ‘Dire’ Sentiment  “The risks in Europe will get worse before it gets
better,” said Matt Brady, an  executive director  for foreign
exchange at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney. “Risk sentiment is
going to be dire as we head into 2012.”  U.K. ten-year gilt yields rose one basis point to 1.98
percent after earlier touching a record low of 1.932 percent.
Gilts returned 17 percent on average in 2011, including
reinvested interest, the most among 26 government markets
tracked by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.  The  S&P GSCI Total Return Index  (SPGSCITR) of commodities slipped 0.1
percent today and fell 1.2 percent for the year. Cocoa in New
York plunged 31 percent in 2011 on signs of expanding supplies
from  Ivory Coast , the biggest producer. Cotton lost 37 percent
this year amid increasing output and dwindling demand. Copper,
often seen as an indicator of economic activity as it is used in
construction and automobiles, had its first loss since 2008.  Gold Rebounds  Gold futures rose 1.7 percent to $1,566.80 an ounce today,
the first gain in seven days. While bullion gained 10 percent
this year, an 11th straight yearly advance, prices have plunged
as much as 21 percent since touching a record $1,923.70 on Sept.
6.  Copper climbed 2 percent to $3.436 a pound. Oil today pared
a third annual increase, slipping 0.8 percent to settle at
$98.83 a barrel, after a second straight month of contraction in
Chinese manufacturing spurred concern that demand may slow in
the second-largest crude-consuming country.  About two shares advanced for every one that fell in the
MSCI Asia Pacific index, which rose 0.5 percent.  Japan ’s Nikkei
225 Stock Average added 0.7 percent and  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index gained 0.2 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.2 percent, its
biggest gain in two weeks. The gauge tumbled 22 percent this
year, the most since 2008, and extended last year’s 14 percent
drop, on concern increases in borrowing costs and Europe’s debt
crisis will derail economic growth in the world’s second-largest
economy. The index’s 33 percent drop since 2009 makes it the
worst performer among the world’s 15 biggest markets.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index  rose 0.1 percent, leaving
it down 20 percent for the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
