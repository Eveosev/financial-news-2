Chilean officials closed the  Torres
del Paine  national park as a  fire  that has razed thousands of
hectares of forest and grasslands in Patagonia entered a fourth
day.  More than 300 government and military personnel from  Chile 
and neighboring  Argentina  and several aircraft have been
deployed to bring the blaze under control, according to the
Chilean emergency service’s website.  The fire has consumed an estimated 8,500 hectares (21,000
acres), President Sebastian Pinera said today in comments
broadcast on national television. The 180,000-hectare park in
Chile’s far south is famous for its vertical  granite peaks  and
is  home to Andean condors , pumas and  endangered huemul  deer.
Winds of 90 kilometers (56 miles) an hour forecast for today are
fanning the flames, the emergency agency, known as Onemi, said.  “The government has taken and will continue to take all
the measures necessary to confront this real catastrophe,”
Pinera said.  Chile has sought help from the U.S. Federal Emergency
Management Agency as well as authorities in  Australia , the
president said. All 400 visitors have been evacuated from the
park, one of Chile’s top tourist destinations, he said.  “We are facing a highly complex situation, with extreme
conditions mainly due to the topography, strong winds and highly
combustible vegetation,” Onemi Director Vicente Nunez said
today in comments published on the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
