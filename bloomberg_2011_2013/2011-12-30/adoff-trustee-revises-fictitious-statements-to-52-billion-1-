The liquidator of  Bernard Madoff ’s
brokerage revised the con man’s fictitious customer statements
to $52 billion from about $65 billion as claims were withdrawn
from the liquidation proceeding.  The new number appears on the website of trustee Irving Picard. Picard so far has paid $325.5 million to investors who
lost money in the Ponzi scheme holding approved claims of $7.3
billion, according to madofftrustee.com. The Securities Investor
Protection Corp. has committed $797.8 million to Madoff
investors, it said. The $65 billion was calculated on Nov. 30,
2008, before Madoff’s arrest.  In the three years since his appointment, Picard has raised
about $8.7 billion to pay claims, mostly through settlements
with investors whom he sued, accusing them of participating in
the fraud. About $6 billion of that amount is tied up in court
challenges, including $5 billion from Jeffry Picower’s estate
and $1 billion from Tremont Group Holdings Inc., according to
the website.  Picard spent $434 million liquidating the estate through
September, including fees for himself and his law firm of more
than $200 million.  Picard, who has filed 1,000 lawsuits seeking $100 billion
from banks such as  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
has seen more than $28 billion of his claims tossed by district
judges. He is currently appealing the rulings. His $59 billion
suit against  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and Bank Medici AG founder Sonja Kohn
is being reviewed by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff.  Madoff, 73, who pleaded guilty to charges of masterminding
the biggest Ponzi scheme in history, is serving a 150-year term
in a federal prison in North Carolina.  The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
