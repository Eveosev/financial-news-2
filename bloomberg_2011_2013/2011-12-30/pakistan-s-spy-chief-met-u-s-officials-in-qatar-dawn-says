The head of  Pakistan ’s military spy
agency, Lieutenant General Ahmed Shuja Pasha, met U.S. officials
during a visit this week to Qatar in what may have been a bid to
repair strained relations, the Dawn newspaper said, citing a
western diplomat it didn’t name.  Pasha’s trip followed the release of a preliminary U.S.
report into an American airstrike on Pakistan border posts that
killed 24 soldiers, the latest incident to shake ties between
the two nations, the paper said.  Pakistan and the U.S. are “on speaking terms,” the paper
quoted foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit as saying at a
weekly briefing. “We want to have a good relationship with the
U.S., a relationship that is based on mutual trust and mutual
respect,” Dawn cited Basit as saying.  To contact the reporter for this story:
