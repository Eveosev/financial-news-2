The developer of One57, slated to
become  New York City ’s tallest residential building, raised the
asking price for the six-bedroom penthouse overlooking Central
Park by 12 percent, to $110 million.  The previous price for the 11,000-square-foot (1,020-
square-meter) unit, which will take up the tower’s 89th and 90th
floors, was $98.5 million, according to Gary Barnett, president
of the Extell Development Co. Prices have gone up an average of
3.9 percent for the building’s 95 condominiums since sales began
about a month ago, he said.  “We’re reflecting the sales in the marketplace,” Barnett
said today in a telephone interview. “Given where the market
is, we’re being very conservative on pricing.”  A sale at that price would make it the most expensive deal
for a single residence ever in  Manhattan , according to  Jonathan
Miller , president of New York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. The
full-floor penthouse at 15 Central Park West owned by Sanford Weill, former chairman of Citigroup Inc. is being purchased for
the daughter of Russian billionaire  Dmitry Rybolovlev , according
to Alan Basiev, a spokesman for Rybolovlev. The 6,744-square-
foot condo was listed for $88 million.  The prior record for a Manhattan residence was the $53
million sale of a townhouse to private-equity investor J.  Christopher Flowers  in 2006, Miller said.  The asking price for the One57 penthouse was reported
earlier today by the Wall Street Journal.  Apartments in the tower across West 57th Street from
 Carnegie Hall , scheduled for completion in 2013, begin at about
$6.5 million for a two-bedroom unit, according to Barnett.  Extell also increased the price for a 13,500-square-foot
condo on the 75th and 76th floors from $98.5 million to $105
million, Barnett said. That unit, known as the “winter garden
duplex,” has room for either a 2,500-square-foot, glass-
enclosed garden or a swimming pool, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
