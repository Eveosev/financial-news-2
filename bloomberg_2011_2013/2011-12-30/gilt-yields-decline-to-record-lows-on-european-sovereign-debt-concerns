U.K. gilt yields dropped to record
lows as investors sought the securities as a haven from turmoil
in euro-region debt markets and slowing economic growth.  Yields on two- and 10-year debt declined to the least since
Bloomberg started tracking the securities in 1989 after an
industry  report (UKNBAAMM)  showed U.K. house prices fell for the first time
in four months. The Debt Management Office sold 2.5 billion
pounds ($3.88 billion) of 27-, 90- and 181-day bills today after
Italy raised less than its maximum target at an auction
yesterday. Gilts were the best-performers this year among 26
government markets tracked by Bloomberg. The pound rose.  “The theme of the U.K.’s safe-haven status is always
relevant when you’ve got concerns about  Europe ,” said  Sam Hill ,
a fixed-income strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in  London .
“When we look at yesterday’s Italian auction, when you
extrapolate that into 2012, it still points to a very uncertain
outlook. The level of primary issuance in Italy next year is
something for the markets to be concerned about and a natural
consequence of that is for gilts to remain firm.”  The 10-year yield was little changed at 1.98 percent at
3:20 p.m. London time after falling to a record 1.932 percent.
The 3.75 percent bond due September 2021 traded at 115.535. The
two-year yield rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 0.33 percent after declining to 0.271 percent. Trading
of gilts shut early today due to the end-of-year holidays.  Annual Return  Italy  sold 7.02 billion euros ($9.11 billion) of debt
yesterday, less than its maximum target of 8.5 billion euros.
The Rome-based Treasury agreed to pay a yield of 6.98 percent on
securities maturing in 2022, close to the 7 percent level that
prompted other euro-area nations to seek bailouts.  Gilts have returned 17 percent on average in 2011,
including reinvested interest, the most among 26 government
markets tracked by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. They beat German debt, considered
the euro area’s safest securities, by more than 7 percentage
points, the most since 1998. Treasuries made 9.8 percent.  Ten-year gilts completed a fourth weekly gain as  Nationwide
Building Society  said the average cost of a U.K. home fell 0.2
percent in December from the previous month. From a year
earlier, values rose 1 percent.  The pound strengthened 0.6 percent to 83.54 pence per euro,
extending this year’s advance to 2.6 percent. Sterling rose 0.8
percent to $1.5532.  Sterling has appreciated 3 percent in the past six months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The yen was the best performer,
rising 11 percent, and the dollar gained 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
