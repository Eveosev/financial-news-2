Corn traders are bullish for a fifth
consecutive week on speculation that dry weather in  South
America  is damaging crops, boosting demand for U.S. supplies at
a time when stockpiles are predicted to shrink to a 16-year low.  Nineteen of 25 traders surveyed by Bloomberg expect corn to
advance next week. Lower-than-average humidity and dry soil will
curb crop development in Argentina and southern Brazil through
at least Jan. 7, according to T-Storm Weather LLC, a forecaster
in Chicago. Argentina is the world’s biggest corn shipper after
the U.S. and typically starts reaping its grain in March.  While prices doubled in the past two years as record demand
eroded inventories, corn fell as much as 27 percent since the
end of August as the U.S. forecast the biggest-ever global
harvest. The grain rallied 11 percent in the past two weeks on
mounting concern that South American weather will undermine that
prediction.  Argentina  and Brazil are expected to produce 90
million metric tons, enough to supply the 27-nation European
Union for 17 months, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “We have already caused irreversible damage to the corn
crop,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing adviser at Toay
Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois . “The dry
weather trend of the past five weeks probably already lowered
production 5 to 7 million tons below the USDA forecasts.”  Annual Advance  Corn climbed 2.8 percent this year, the third consecutive
annual advance. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
commodities gained 2.1 percent, and the MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities retreated 9.4 percent. Treasuries returned 9.7
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Even as corn and soybean prices gain on concern that
supplies will fall short of estimates, other commodities are
expected to drop because slower economic growth will curb demand
for raw materials. Traders expect gold, copper and raw sugar to
decline next week, separate Bloomberg surveys showed.  Almost every growing area of Argentina, southern  Brazil  and
 Paraguay  received less than 50 percent of average rainfall since
Dec. 1, T-Storm said in a report yesterday. Rainfall in
Argentina’s corn and  soybean (US38PRWR)  region was 75 percent below normal,
the forecaster said. Some areas of central and northern Brazil
may get as much as 1.3 inches of rain from Dec. 30 to 31, easing
the stress on crops, T-Storm said.  Growing Season  The weather is similar to the 2008-2009 growing season,
when La Nina conditions associated with drought in South America
strengthened in December, according to T-Storm. Combined  corn (US09PRWR) 
output in Argentina and Brazil fell almost 18 percent in 2009,
according to USDA estimates. The La Nina phenomenon typically
brings heavier rainfall in  Asia  and drier weather in South
America.  Corn may also advance because of growing demand for meat.
Global production of beef, veal, pork, chicken and turkey will
reach 248.6 million tons next year, 21 percent more than a
decade ago and 62 percent more than in 1992, the USDA estimates.
It takes about 2.6 pounds of corn to produce a pound of beef,
compared with 3.6 pounds for pork and 2 pounds for chicken,
according to industry estimates.  Ethanol refiners may also use more grain. About 30 percent
of U.S. corn went into producing the fuel in 2008, compared with
11 percent in 2002, according to the Journal of Applied Poultry
Research. Output increased 0.5 percent to 943,000 barrels a day
in the week ended Dec. 16, the second-highest weekly total on
record, according to the Energy Department. That may further
diminish U.S. corn  stockpiles (CUSEENDS)  that the USDA predicts will drop
to the lowest since 1996 by Aug. 31.  Money Managers  Hedge funds  and other money managers  are (.MMCANET)  bullish corn. They
are holding a net-long position, or bets on higher prices, of
148,653 futures and options, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. While speculators trimmed their bets by 64
percent from this year’s high in January, they have held a net-
long position since April 20, 2010.  Traders are the most bearish on gold since July 29, with 13
of 24 surveyed expecting the metal to decline next week. Futures
on the Comex in  New York  climbed 10 percent this year to
$1,566.80 an ounce, an 11th consecutive annual gain.  Holdings in gold-backed  exchange-traded products (.GLDTONS)  fell about
34 tons since Dec. 14, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At 2,327
tons, the total is still within 1.5 percent of the record set
that day and valued at $114.9 billion.  Worst Performance  Nine of 24 traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expect copper to decline next week. Copper for three-month
delivery fell 21 percent to $7,600 a ton this year, its worst
performance since 2008.  Three of seven surveyed expect raw-sugar to decline next
week, and one was bullish. The commodity fell 27 percent this
year to 23.3 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Eighteen of 26 people surveyed expect soybeans to rise next
week. Prices have dropped 14 percent this year to $12.0775 a
bushel in  Chicago .  Economies in the euro region will contract 0.2 percent next
year from 1.6 percent growth this year, according to the median
of 21 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Expansion in
 China , the biggest consumer of everything from copper to energy,
will slow to 8.5 percent from 9.2 percent, the median of 14
estimates shows.  “Commodity markets look vulnerable to economic weakness,”
said Jeffrey Sherman, who helps manage more than $21 billion of
assets at DoubleLine Capital LP in  Los Angeles . “We are seeing
a slowdown in  Europe , weaker economic data in China, and all of
this suggests that there are going to be some strong headwinds
for commodities in 2012.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
