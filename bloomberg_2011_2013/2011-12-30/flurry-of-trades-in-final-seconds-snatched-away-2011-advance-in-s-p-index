A two-point  decline (SPX)  completed in the
last seconds of trading sent the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to
a 2011 loss of 4/100ths of a point, ending a two-year streak of
gains for the benchmark gauge of American equities.  The measure traded at an  average price (SPX)  of 1,261.18 during
the day and stood at 1,260 with 10 minutes left, up about 2
points from its Dec. 31, 2010, close of 1,257.64. It remained
positive for the year with 15 seconds to go at 1,257.91 before
slipping to 1,257.60 on the session’s last trades.  “There was a frenzy,” said Stephen Guilfoyle, who works
on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as U.S. economist
for Meridian Equity Partners in  New York . “You saw people
breaking into a run, the old-school nervousness, some shouting.
You see that nervousness when orders are coming in the last
minute.”  The  volatility (SPX)  was characteristic of a year in which stocks
swung at a daily rate of twice the 50-year average after the  S&P
500  reached a three-year high in April. From its peak of
1,263.61, the index plunged 19 percent through Oct. 3 and then
climbed back to where it began the year.  This year’s move was the  smallest (SPX)  since 1947 when the index
closed exactly unchanged. Individual stocks were more volatile
than in 2009 and 2010, with 55 losing more than 30 percent this
year compared with a total of 13 in the prior two.  ‘On a Rollercoaster’  “It’s almost like you’re getting on a  rollercoaster (SPX) , where
you get on and it’s a wild ride, and you get off at the exact
same point,” Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee about $209
billion as chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage
Funds in  Menomonee Falls ,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone
interview.  About 4.1 billion  shares (MVOLUSE)  changed hands on all U.S.
exchanges today, the third-slowest full-day session of the year
and 45 percent below the three-month average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, as trading slowed before the New Year
holiday.  The 2.6-point  retreat (SPX)  between 3:50 p.m. and 4 p.m. was
almost twice as big as the next largest decline for any 10-
minute period during the day, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
 Volume (MVOLUSE)  during the period was at least 126 percent greater than
in any other comparable interval before the close.  “It looks notable on a chart because the rest of the day
was so lame and without any movement whatsoever,” Manoj Narang,
founder and chief executive officer of Tradeworx Inc., an
automated trading firm in  Red Bank ,  New Jersey , said in a phone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
