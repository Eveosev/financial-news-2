The euro dropped below 100 yen for
the first time since June 2001 in a sixth straight day of
decline on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will weigh on the
region’s economic growth.  The 17-nation currency had its first back-to-back annual
decreases versus the dollar in a decade. The Australian and New
Zealand dollars rose as stocks rallied before reports next week
forecast to show the  U.S. economy  is recovering, increasing
demand for higher-yielding assets. China’s yuan climbed to a 17-
year high on signs the central bank favors the currency’s
appreciation to prevent capital outflows.  “You have the dismal growth outlook for the euro zone,
that only adds another weight around the single currency,” said
 Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in  Washington  at Travelex Global
Business Payments, a currency-exchange network. “Taking out
that 100 level against the yen, that doesn’t bode too well for
the euro going into next year.”  The euro fell 1 percent to 99.66 yen at 5 p.m. in  New York 
after dropping to 99.51 yen, the lowest level since December
2000. The shared currency was little changed at $1.2961. The yen
gained 0.9 percent to 76.91 per dollar after reaching 76.89, the
strongest since Nov. 22.  Euro Numbers  The shared European currency was the worst performer among
10 developed-nation currencies this year, declining 2 percent,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.
The dollar advanced 1.1 percent and the yen gained 5.5 percent.  South Africa’s rand declined 18 percent against the dollar
in 2011, the most of the U.S. currency’s major peers, according
to Bloomberg data, followed by Mexico’s peso, with an 11.5
percent loss. The yen has advanced 5.5 percent for the largest
gain against the greenback.  The Australian dollar appreciated 0.7 percent to $1.0209
and the New Zealand currency advanced 0.8 percent to 77.72 U.S.
cents as U.S. economic prospects encouraged risk.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of shares climbed 0.4 percent, and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent.  Europe’s shared currency may weaken to 99 yen in the first
quarter of 2012, according to the median forecasts of 35
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. The shared currency will
weaken to $1.28 in the second quarter of next year, according to
a separate survey of 41 analysts.  Summit Failures  Two years of summits have failed to contain a European debt
crisis that has led to bailouts of  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal 
and now threatens Italy and Spain.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  will go to Berlin on Jan.
9 to resume talks with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to end
the turmoil, according to an official familiar with the matter.
The leaders aim to complete revisions to Europe’s fiscal
rulebook by March, following decisions made at a Dec. 9 summit,
and are reassessing plans to cap the overall lending of their
permanent rescue facility at 500 billion euros ($649 billion).  “There’s fatigue in the sense that the  euro-zone  problems
-- we thought they’d be fixed partially by now, but obviously
they’re not,” said Brian Kim, a currency strategist in
Stamford,  Connecticut , at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Futures traders (.ECLRG)  increased their bets that the euro will
drop against the dollar to a record high, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  Futures Positions  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 127,879 in the
week ended Dec. 27, compared with net shorts of 113,697 a week
earlier. That’s the largest amount since the common currency’s
inception in 1999.  A gauge of euro-region manufacturing was 46.9 in December
from 46.4 the previous month, according to economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News before Markit Economics releases the data Jan.
2. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Spain’s budget deficit will reach 8 percent of gross
domestic product this year, more than the previous government’s
forecast of 6 percent, government spokeswoman Soraya Saenz de
Santamaria said at a press conference in  Madrid .  Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government will cut spending
by 8.9 billion euros in the first quarter and raise taxes. The
 yield (GSPG10YR)  on Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond fell eight basis points
to 5.094 percent.  The U.S. dollar’s share of global foreign-exchange reserves
climbed in the third quarter to the highest since late 2010,
while holdings of euros declined to a three-year low,
International Monetary Fund data show.  Reserve Holdings  The U.S. currency’s portion rose to 61.7 percent in the
period ended Sept. 30, the highest since the last three months
of 2010, from 60.3 percent in the prior quarter, according to
data from the Washington-based IMF quarterly data. The share of
euros fell to 25.7 percent, the lowest since July through
September in 2008.  The Institute for Supply Management’s U.S.  factory index (NAPMPMI) 
rose to 53.2 in December from 52.7 in the previous month,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
before a Jan. 3 report. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.
U.S. growth will quicken to 2.1 percent in 2012 from 1.8 percent
this year, according to a separate Bloomberg News survey.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, fell 0.3 percent to 80.204. The measure rose
1.6 percent this year after appreciating 1.3 percent last year,
the first time it’s gained two years in a row since 2001.  Riskier assets will rise “if we can confirm that the U.S.
economy is on a recovery path from the economic data next
week,” said  Marito Ueda , senior managing director in  Tokyo  at
FX Prime Corp., a currency margin company.  China Currency  The yuan advanced for a third day as the central bank set
its  reference rate (CNYMUSD)  0.2 percent stronger at 6.3009 against the
greenback, the highest level since a dollar peg ended in 2005.  Hong Lei, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said on
Dec. 28 that  China  will continue to push for exchange-rate
flexibility. Chinese manufacturing shrank less this month than
in November, data showed today.  “The fixing may break through the key 6.3 level on the
first trading day after the holiday,” following the spot rate,
said  Liu Dongliang , a senior analyst in Shenzhen at China
Merchants Bank Co. “The yuan may appreciate about 3 percent at
most next year.”  The yuan gained as much as 0.4 percent to 6.2940 per
dollar, the strongest since the country unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The  Turkish lira (TRY)  strengthened the most since March 2009
against the dollar after the nation’s central bank said it’s
selling dollars for liras in the market due to “unhealthy
pricing in foreign exchange rates.” It made the comments in an
e-mailed statement.  The lira surged as much as 3.1 percent to 1.8575 per dollar
before gaining 1.4 percent to 1.8909.  To contact the reporter on this story:
