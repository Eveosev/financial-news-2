India ’s rupee completed its first
annual loss since 2008 as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened to
derail global economic growth and hurt demand for financial
assets in developing nations.  The currency weakened the most in Asia this year, touching
a record low of 54.305 per dollar on Dec. 15, as foreign funds
cut holdings of Indian stocks by $380 million, exchange data
show. The $1.7 trillion economy may miss the central bank’s
growth estimate of 7.6 percent for the 12 months ending March
31, Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said Dec. 22. Sovereign bonds
completed a third annual decline on speculation the government
will boost its debt-sale plan from a record.  “It was a bad year for the rupee and the first half of
2012 could be tough as well,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general
manager of treasury at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “The
problems in Europe are likely to persist.”  The rupee slid 15.8 percent in 2011 and 0.2 percent this
week to 53.0650 per dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It was little changed today. The currency may
slide to 60 per dollar next year, CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets and
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB predicted this month.  India’s currency also underperformed those of the largest
 emerging markets  this year.  Brazil ’s real lost 11 percent to
1.8657 per dollar and the Russian ruble fell 5.4 percent to
32.2669. The Chinese yuan appreciated 4.7 percent to 6.2940.  Central Bank Intervention  The  Reserve Bank  of India intervened in the foreign-
exchange market yesterday and sold dollars after the rupee fell
to 53.50, according to three traders at state-owned banks, who
declined to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak to the media on central bank action. The central bank
“doesn’t comment on day-to-day market movements,” spokeswoman
Alpana Killawala said.  The monetary authority announced measures this quarter to
curb speculation and volatility in the rupee market. Local
companies can’t enter into multiple forward contracts to cover a
single overseas transaction, it said this month. The bank eased
rules in November for firms to borrow offshore and sell foreign
currencies through swaps, and allowed lenders to offer higher
deposit rates for Indians living outside the country.  “These are not the only measures we have,” RBI Deputy
Governor  Subir Gokarn  told reporters in Mumbai last week.
“There are other measures we can undertake to bring stability
to this market.”  Three-month offshore forwards were at 54.53 to the dollar,
compared with 54.81 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or
sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts
are settled in dollars. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares
lost 25 percent in 2011.  Bonds Decline  Benchmark sovereign bonds fell on speculation the economic
slowdown will cut the government’s revenue and force it to sell
more debt than planned. Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee 
expanded the annual borrowing program by 13 percent in September
to a record 4.7 trillion rupees ($88.4 billion).  India may raise that target again, a finance ministry
official, who declined to be identified ahead of a public
announcement, said yesterday.  “I would expect additional borrowing of about 400 billion
rupees,” said N.S. Venkatesh, head of treasury at Mumbai-based
IDBI Bank Ltd. “The government cannot afford to cut spending as
this would stall economic growth.”  The yield on  10-year sovereign bonds (GIND10YR)  rose 65 basis points,
or 0.65 percentage point, this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest increase in such rates after
 Vietnam  in  Asia . The rate on the 8.79 percent note due November
2021 climbed two basis points today and 20 this week to 8.57
percent, according to the central bank’s trading system.  Wider Spreads  The  extra yield (USGG10YR)  sought on the notes over similar maturity
 U.S. Treasuries  surged 205 basis points in 2011 to 667 basis
points. The spread reached a 12-year high of 697 basis points in
November.  Rupee-denominated notes returned 5.9 percent this year
compared with the region’s best performance of 22 percent for
Indonesian securities, HSBC Holdings Plc indexes show. Overseas
investors raised  holdings (FIINDEBT)  of Indian debt by $8.5 billion this
year to a record $26.3 billion on Dec. 23, exchange data show.  “Government borrowing is pressuring the yields upward,”
Federal Bank’s Paul said. “But the slowing economy will force
an interest-rate cut next year and so yields should move
downward in 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
