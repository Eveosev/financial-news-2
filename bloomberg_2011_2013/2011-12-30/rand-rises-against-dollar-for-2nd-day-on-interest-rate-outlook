The rand strengthened for a second
day, paring its first annual decline since 2008, after credit
growth in November exceeded analysts’ estimates and fueled
speculation interest rates will rise next year.  South Africa ’s currency, the worst performer this year out
of 12 major currencies on Bloomberg, appreciated 1.1 percent to
8.0987 per dollar as of 2:18 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand has
retreated 18 percent in 2011, its first year of decline since
depreciating 27 percent in 2008.  Borrowing by households and businesses rose 6.22 percent,
compared with 5.5 percent in October. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of five economists was 5.9 percent. The  Reserve
Bank  has kept the benchmark rate at 5.5 percent this year to
support  consumer spending  as  Europe ’s debt crisis sapped demand
for exports.  “The data is rand-positive,” Thabi Leoka, a Johannesburg-
based analyst at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in e-mailed
comments. “The rand remains at the mercy of global risk
sentiment, specifically the extent to which investors look to
take advantage of the low interest rate environment to invest in
risky, high-yielding assets.”  South Africa’s 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 gained for a
third day, cutting the yield two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 6.74 percent. The yield has declined 62
basis points this year, a second year of gains for bondholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
