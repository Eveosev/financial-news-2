The euro area’s economy probably
shrank for a third month in December amid falling consumer
demand, the  Eurocoin index  showed.  The gauge measuring economic activity in the 17-nation
region was stable at minus 0.2 percent, the London-based  Centre
for Economic Policy Research  and the  Bank of Italy , which co-
produce the index, said today in an e-mailed report.  The reading reflects “the worsening in the indicators of
demand,” according to the report. Still, “the outcome reflects
the improvement in some qualitative surveys of industrial and
service firms which offset” the other indicators.  In October, the Eurocoin showed a negative reading for the
first time since September 2009.  The index, which includes price figures and stock-market
performances, industrial production and business and consumer
confidence readings, aims to provide a real-time estimate of
economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
