Limak Holding AS  of  Turkey  purchased
the port of Iskenderun from the government for $372 million
after obtaining a $425 million loan.  The Ankara-based company, which has construction, energy
and airport interests, got the 13 1/2-year loan from six banks
and made the payment to the government’s asset sales agency
today, it said in an e-mailed statement.  Limak said it will use the rest of the loan to build
container capacity of 1.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units,
or TEUs, at the port, on Turkey’s eastern Mediterranean coast.  The country’s antitrust regulator has approved the sale of
operating rights at Iskenderun to Limak for a period of 36
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
