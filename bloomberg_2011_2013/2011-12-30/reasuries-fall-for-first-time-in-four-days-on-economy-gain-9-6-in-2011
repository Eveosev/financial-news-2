Treasuries advanced for a fourth
day, capping their biggest annual return since 2008, as
investors sought the refuge of U.S. government securities on
concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen.  Bonds extended gains as Spain’s new government moved to
increase taxes and reduce spending to tackle a larger-than-
forecast budget deficit that’s twice the fiscal shortfall in
 Italy . Treasuries are set to beat stocks, commodities and the
dollar for the year, even as reports signal the  U.S. economy  is
recovering.  “On its own, rates would be significantly higher in the
U.S., but we are not an island unto ourselves,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of government and agency
debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and
dealer for institutional investors. “The exogenous impact from
Europe is clearly keeping our rates much lower than they would
be otherwise.”  The 10-year note  yield (USGG10YR)  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.88 percent as of 2:43 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It declined 15 basis
points this week and lost 19 basis points in December. The 2
percent securities due in November 2021 rose 6/32 today, or
$1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 3/32. Their last four-day
winning streak ended Nov. 17.  Thirty-year bond (USGG30YR)  yields decreased one basis point to 2.89
percent today, and five-year note yields dropped five basis
points to 0.83 percent.  Lower Volumes  Treasury market volumes have slid amid the Christmas and
New Year’s holiday season. About $103 billion of Treasuries
 changed hands (ICPTVOL)  today as of 2:01 p.m. through ICAP Plc, the
world’s largest interdealer broker. About $109 billion changed
hands yesterday. The 2011 daily average is $285 billion.  The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
recommended that trading in Treasuries  close  at 2 p.m. in New
York and remain shut on Jan. 2 in observance of New Year’s Eve
and New Year’s Day.  The  Federal Reserve  said today it will  purchase  about $45
billion of Treasuries in January and sell about $44 billion in
its program to lower borrowing costs by replacing $400 billion
of shorter-term assets in its holdings with longer-term debt.  U.S. government debt  returned 9.6 percent in 2011,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data, even after
Standard & Poor’s cut the nation’s AAA rating on Aug. 5. German
bunds also gained 9.6 percent, while Japanese bonds advanced 2.1
percent and U.S. corporate debt rallied 7.3 percent.  Record Low  Benchmark 10-year yields dropped to a record 1.67 percent
on Sept. 23 amid the European debt turmoil. Two years of summits
have failed to contain a crisis that has led to bailouts of
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  and now threatens  Spain  and Italy.  Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of
euro-area finance ministers, said economic growth in the 17-
nation region “isn’t good.” He spoke on RTL Luxembourg radio.  Spain’s deficit this year will reach 8 percent of gross
domestic product, requiring tax boosts of 6 billion euros and
spending cuts of 8.9 billion euros, spokeswoman Soraya Saenz de
Santamaria said at a press conference in  Madrid .  “A year ago there was probably a greater expectation that
rates would start to creep higher,” said Adam Brown, director
of Treasury trading at Barclays Plc in New York, one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “The economy, although
it seems better and we’ve had some decent growth, is not growing
strong enough that there’s no fear that it dips back down,
especially with something like the European issue affecting
it.”  A four-week bill sale on Dec. 20 drew  bids (USB4WBC)  for a record
9.07 times the amount offered even though rates on the
securities were below zero in New York trading.  Foreign Central Banks  U.S. government securities rose in December even as
Treasuries held in custody at the Fed for foreign central banks
and other official investors fell by $68.9 billion, the biggest
four-week drop on record, according to Fed data. The reduction
came as the dollar strengthened, with the Dollar  Index (DXY) 
increasing 2.3 percent in December.  “It’s not unlikely they are repatriating assets to shore
up their own economies,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond
strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  S&P Downgrade  S&P downgraded the U.S. rating this year for the first
time, criticizing lawmakers for failing to cut spending enough
to reduce  budget deficits (FDEBTY)  that exceed $1 trillion a year.  Treasuries still were some of the best assets to own in
2011. U.S. 30-year bonds returned 35 percent, the most since
2008, and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities gained 14
percent, the most since 2002, the Bank of America indexes show.  The  difference (USGGBE10)  between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was 1.95
percentage points today. The average over the past decade is
2.13 percentage points.  Stocks have lost 6.8 percent this year after accounting for
reinvested dividends, based on the  MSCI All Country World Index (MXWD) .
The Dollar Index tracking the U.S. currency against six major
counterparts rose 1.5 percent in 2011. The  Standard & Poor’s 
GSCI Total Return  Index (SPGSCITR)  of commodities slipped 1 percent.  Growth in the world’s biggest economy will quicken to 2.1
percent in 2012 from 1.8 percent in 2011, a Bloomberg survey of
banks and securities companies shows. U.S. jobless-benefit
applications over the past month fell to a three-year low, data
showed yesterday. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago
Inc. said its business barometer was at 62.5 this month,
compared with a Bloomberg poll forecast of 61. Readings above 50
signal growth.  U.S. payrolls added 150,000 workers in December, after
gaining 120,000 in November, according to another Bloomberg
survey before the government reports the data on Jan. 6.  Treasury 10-year yields will advance to 2.66 percent by the
end of 2012, according to a Bloomberg survey with the most
recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
