Stocks (MXAP)  and commodities rose, paring
the first annual loss in three years, as signs the U.S. economic
recovery is strengthening countered concern Europe’s debt crisis
will worsen. The euro was near a decade-low against the yen.  The MSCI All Country World Index added 0.3 percent as of
8:02 a.m. in London, set for a 9.5 percent decline this year.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures were little changed and
Treasury 10-year yields rose one basis point to 1.91 percent.
The S&P GSCI Total Return Index of raw materials gained 0.3
percent as copper jumped 1.4 percent and gold snapped three days
of losses. The euro slid 0.2 percent versus the yen and weakened
0.2 percent against the dollar.  Global equity markets have lost $6.3 trillion in value this
year as  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing economic expansion
worldwide weighed on investor demand for riskier assets. Italy
yesterday raised less than its maximum target at a debt auction.
Data yesterday showed U.S. home sales rose more than economists
forecast and jobless claims dropped over the past month to a
three-year low.  “This year, the world was swayed by the European debt
crisis,” said Takashi Aoki, who helps manage 120 billion yen
($1.5 billion) at Tokyo-based Mizuho Asset Management Co. “More
investors think the U.S. economy is firmer and growing slowly,
and this will last for a while. Europe has entered a recession
but it’s unlikely to deteriorate badly. Emerging countries are
transitioning from economic slowdown to faster growth again.”  Europe’s Declines  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.4 percent, paring its
2011 loss to 12 percent. An index of bank shares on the gauge
has dropped 33 percent this year, the worst performance among 19
industry groups. The Stoxx 600’s decline this year  compares (MXAP)  with
an 18 percent drop in the MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index and a 0.4
percent increase in the S&P 500.  About two shares advanced for every one that fell on MSCI’s
Asia Pacific index, which rose 0.4 percent.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225
Stock Average added 0.7 percent and  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index
gained 0.2 percent. South Korean and Philippine financial
markets are closed today.  Gree Inc. (3632) , a social-network operator, has rallied 157
percent this year, the best performer on MSCI’s Asia Pacific
index.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , whose Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear station was wrecked by the March 11 earthquake, is the
worst performer, losing 91 percent this year.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.2 percent even after
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said a purchasing
managers’ index was at 48.7 in December. That compares with a
preliminary result of 49 reported on Dec. 15 and a final reading
of 47.7 for November.  ‘Firmer’ U.S. Economy  The  S&P 500  erased  losses (SPX)  for the year after data yesterday
showed the National Association of Realtors’ index of pending
home sales increased 7.3 percent to the highest level since
April 2010. Economists forecast a 1.5 percent gain, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Other figures showed business activity in the U.S. expanded
more than forecast in December, while the four-week moving
average for jobless claims, a less volatile measure than the
weekly figures, dropped to 375,000 last week, the lowest level
since June 2008, Labor Department data showed. Applications rose
for the first time in a month in the week ended Dec. 24,
climbing by a more-than-forecast 15,000 to 381,000.  “Investors increasingly feel the  U.S. economy  is firmer
than they had expected,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market
analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “The economic data is looking
good and that will boost stock markets, especially when concern
about Europe’s debt issues aren’t in the forefront.”  Yearly Gain  Treasuries fell for the first time in four days amid
speculation the rally that pushed U.S. government securities to
their best yearly gain since 2008 will give way to losses in
2012 as the economy improves. American debt returned 9.6 percent
in 2011 as of yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data, even after S&P cut the U.S.’s AAA credit rating on
Aug. 5.  The cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds against
non-payment fell in Asia, with the Markit iTraxx Asia index of
40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan decreasing two basis
points to 204.5, according to BNP Paribas SA prices. At those
levels, the gauge will have climbed 101.5 basis points this year,
the biggest gain since 2008 when it advanced 275 basis points,
according to data provider CMA.  Europe’s shared currency fell yesterday to 100.06 yen, the
weakest level since June 2001, after Italy auctioned 7 billion
euros ($9 billion) of debt. That fell short of the 8.5 billion-
euro target even as borrowing costs declined from last month.
Italian 10-year yields rose three basis points to 7.03 percent
after the sale.  ‘Dire’ Sentiment  The 17-nation euro has dropped against the dollar and yen
this year amid concern the debt crisis will weigh on the
region’s economy growth. Data next week may confirm European
manufacturing contracted for a fifth straight month.  “The risks in Europe will get worse before it gets
better,” said Matt Brady, an  executive director  for foreign
exchange at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney. “Risk sentiment is
going to be dire as we head into 2012 and I’m not a believer in
being long any risk currencies.”  The Australian dollar rose 0.1 percent to $1.0148, while
 New Zealand ’s currency gained 0.1 percent to 77.24 U.S. cents.
The currencies are poised to end the year lower against their
U.S. counterpart.  China ’s yuan climbed to a 17-year high of
6.3070 per dollar. It gained 4.4 percent this year, beating the
3.6 percent advance in 2010.  Copper, Gold  S&P’s  GSCI Total Return Index (SPGSCITR)  of raw materials has slipped
0.8 percent this year. Three-month copper rallied 1.3 percent to
$7,522.75 a metric ton in  London , paring a 22 percent annual
fall. Oil for February delivery was little changed at $99.66 a
barrel in  New York  after having gained 9.1 percent this year.
Crude is headed for a third yearly increase on speculation that
escalating tension in the  Middle East  may disrupt supplies.  Gold rebounded from a drop to the lowest level in six
months, as the slump that threatened to tip the metal into a
 bear market  spurred purchases. Immediate-delivery gold climbed 1
percent to $1,561.18 an ounce, up 9.9 percent in 2011. Bullion
reached a record $1,921.15 on Sept. 6, and would need to close
below $1,536.92 to enter a bear market, typically defined as a
drop of more than 20 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
