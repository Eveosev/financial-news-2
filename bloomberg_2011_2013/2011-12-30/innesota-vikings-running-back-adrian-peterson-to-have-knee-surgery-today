Minnesota Vikings  running back
 Adrian Peterson  will have surgery today to repair two torn
ligaments in his left knee, six days after he was injured in a
win against the Washington Redskins.  Peterson, 26, who is in his fifth season with the Vikings,
was selected for the Pro Bowl in each of his first four National
Football League seasons. He finished this season with 970 yards
rushing, after running for at least 1,298 yards in each
preceding season.  Peterson was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 26, two days
after tearing the anterior cruciate and medial collateral
ligaments in his left knee. Vikings trainer Eric Sugarman had
said the surgery would take place early in 2012.  “In this case, everything was in place to have the
surgery,” Vikings coach  Leslie Frazier  told reporters
yesterday. “He’s anxious to get his surgery done and get
started on his rehab.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
