The lira strengthened the most in
almost three years and bond yields jumped after Turkey’s central
bank sold dollars for liras in the  currency market  and through
an auction.  The lira surged as much as 3.1 percent to 1.8575 per
dollar, the biggest increase since March 2009, and gained 1.5
percent to 1.8882 at 5:30 p.m. in Istanbul, the highest level
since Dec. 1. The bank may have sold between $700 million and
$1.5 billion in the direct sale, according to two traders who
spoke by telephone on the condition of anonymity because they
aren’t allowed to speak to the media on such matters.  “The rate of the lira against the dollar had fallen to as
much as 1.92 very rapidly and the central bank sees that as a
risk for inflation and said that it doesn’t like that kind of
volatility,” Hakan Aklar, an economist for Ak Invest in
Istanbul, said by telephone. “It’s year-end, the market is not
deep, and it may have spotted some speculative action.”  The bank acted to sell dollars after seeing “unhealthy
price formations” in the foreign exchanges markets, it said in
an e-mailed statement.  The lira reached 1.9224 per dollar on Dec. 28, a historic
low. In the year it lost 18.3 percent, the worst performer among
emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The weaker
currency will add as much as 4 percentage points to inflation
this year, driving the rate to almost double the bank’s year-end
goal of 5.5 percent, governor Erdem Basci said on Dec. 27.  Auction  The central bank also sold $750 million in a daily auction
of dollars for liras today, getting $920 million of bids, the
bank said. The central bank will announce the size of any direct
sale of dollars for liras in the currency markets within 15
days, according to a policy announced this week.  Turkey ’s foreign-exchange reserves declined to $82.8
billion as of Dec. 23, equivalent to about five months of
imports. The reserves fell from a peak of $93.9 billion on July
7, according to data from the central bank published yesterday.  Yields (TRABNBM)  on two-year lira bonds jumped 50 basis points, or
half a percentage point, to 11.48 percent, according to a Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc index of the securities. Yields rose
437 basis points, or 4.37 percentage points in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
