Swiss stocks (SMI)  rose to a five-month
high, paring the benchmark index’s decline in 2011, after the
country’s central bank said foreign-currency reserves gained and
 Germany ’s Finance Minister ruled out a euro-area breakup.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  climbed 1.5 percent, following gains in
European construction shares. Petroplus Holdings AG added 6.1
percent after reports the refiner reached a financing agreement.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, increased 0.7 percent to 5,936.23 at
the close in Zurich. That’s the highest since July 26. The gauge
has still dropped 7.8 percent in 2011, its worst annual
performance since 2008. Banks led losses in 2011, with UBS AG
and Credit Suisse Group AG retreating more than 27 percent. The
broader Swiss Performance Index gained 0.6 percent today.  The Swiss central bank’s foreign currency holdings
increased to 261.9 billion Swiss francs ($278 billion) at the
end of November from 261.8 billion francs in the previous month,
it said in a statement today.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  ruled out a
euro-area breakup and said the region is doing everything to
maintain confidence in the single currency, according to an
interview with Germany’s Handelsblatt.  Low Volume  Post-Christmas trading has been low, with average daily
 volume (SXXPVOLC)  in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index this week dipping to 33
percent of this year’s average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Exchanges in the U.K., Ireland and Germany closed
early today for the New Year’s holiday.  “Volumes are relatively quiet,” Ken Polcari, a managing
director at ICAP Plc’s equities unit in  New York , said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “Next week, we’ve got the new
year. The focus will once again turn to the bigger European
problem.”  China’s economic growth is expected to be more than 9
percent this year, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a New
Year’s editorial today. Even so, the economy may face downside
pressure next year, Xinhua says.  Holcim advanced 1.5 percent to 50.25 francs after four days
of losses.  Petroplus rose 6.1 percent to 1.74 francs, rebounding from
a record low. The oil refiner reached a provisional financing
agreement with lenders after a credit freeze, Reuters reported,
citing a person it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
