Jordanian officials will visit Qatar
next week to discuss importing liquefied natural gas to replace
supplies from  Egypt  that have been disrupted by pipeline
bombings, the International Oil Daily said.  Oil and gas officials from  Jordan  will be in Doha from Jan.
2 to Jan. 4, Jordanian Energy Minister Qutaiba Abu Qura told the
Oil Daily.  The talks with Qatar are at an early stage and the amount
will be discussed later, Marwan Bakain, the director of the
natural gas department in Jordanâ€™s energy ministry, was cited as
saying. Any supplies will be part of a temporary solution, he
told the newsletter.  Jordan, which imports nearly all of its energy supplies, is
aiming to produce enough gas to be self sufficient through a
project with  BP Plc (BP/) , Bakain said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
