fell 0.6 percent to 3.47 liras. Its parent Park Holding AS
requested extra time to make a payment for a  power grid  on
Istanbul’s European side, for which it offered $2.5 billion, a

of its 25 percent stake in Socar & Turcas Enerji AS to the State
Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, known as Socar, for $44 million. Turcas
also bought 18.5 percent of Socar & Turcas Rafineri AS from
