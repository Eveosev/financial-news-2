Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., one of the nation’s so-called four pillar lenders,
is planning to issue its first covered bonds in euros after a
change in the law allowed the sale of the asset-backed notes.  ANZ (ANZ)  hired Barclays Capital, Natixis, UBS AG and  UniCredit
SpA (UCG)  to manage the sale, which will take place early in 2012
subject to market conditions, according to a banker involved.
The Melbourne-based bank raised $1.25 billion from an issue of
2.4 percent dollar covered bonds due 2016 on Nov. 15, its first
public sale of the notes in any currency, Bloomberg data show.  The new euro issue, as well as last month’s U.S. dollar
sale, follow an amendment to Australia’s Banking Act in October
that allows the country’s banks to sell covered bonds.
Traditionally issued by European lenders, the securities are
backed by mortgages or other assets as well as the issuer’s
guarantee and typically carry top credit ratings.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s biggest
lender, was also said in November to be planning its first
covered bond sale after the legislation change.  National
Australia Bank (NAB)  sold 2.5 billion Norwegian krone ($416 million)
of 5 percent covered notes maturing in 2021 earlier this month,
while Westpac issued $1 billion of 2.45 percent bonds due 2016
on Nov. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ANZ’s new deal is due to be rated Aaa by Moody’s Investor’s
Service and AAA by Fitch Ratings, said the banker involved in
the deal, who declined to be identified before it’s completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
