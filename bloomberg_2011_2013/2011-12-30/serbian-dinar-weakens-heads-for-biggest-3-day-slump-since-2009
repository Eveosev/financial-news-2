Serbia’s dinar weakened against the
euro in the world’s biggest currency slump today, headed for its
steepest three-day depreciation in almost three years.  The dinar slid 1.8 percent to 106.4847 per euro as of 2:05
p.m. in Belgrade, making it the worst performer among more than
170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It was poised for a 3.9
percent three-day decline, the biggest in the period since
January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
