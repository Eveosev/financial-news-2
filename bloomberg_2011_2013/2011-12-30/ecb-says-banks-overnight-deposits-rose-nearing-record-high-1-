The  European Central Bank  said
overnight deposits from financial institutions rose, approaching
an all-time high.  Euro-area banks parked 445.7 billion euros ($576.8 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 436.6 billion
euros a day earlier. Deposits reached 452 billion euros on Dec.
27, the most since the euro’s introduction in 1999.  The ECB last week lent 523 banks a record 489 billion euros
for three years to keep credit flowing to the 17-nation euro
economy during the sovereign debt crisis. It lent the money at
its  benchmark rate (EURR002W)  of 1 percent. Banks are depositing excess
cash back with the ECB at the overnight rate of 0.25 percent,
incurring a loss rather than lending it for more elsewhere.  Analysts including Aline Schuiling, a senior economist at
ABN Amro NV in Amsterdam, have warned not to read too much into
the rush of deposits as some financial institutions are closed
in the final week of the year and market activity is muted.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
