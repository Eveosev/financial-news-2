Natural-gas futures in New York
dropped below $3 per British thermal units for the first time in
more than two years as mild weather and rising production
contribute to a growing U.S. stockpile surplus.  Gas fell as much as 1.2 percent in electronic trading after
an Energy Department report yesterday showed a smaller-than-
forecast stockpile decline in the week ended Dec. 23. Supplies
fell 81 billion cubic feet to 3.548 trillion, compared with the
five-year average drop for the week of 122 billion cubic feet.
Inventories were 13.7 percent above the weekly average.  “We’ve seen that gas has been depressed for a while,”
said Kevin Cabla, an analyst with  Raymond James  in Houston.
“Three dollars is less of a technical support, it’s more
psychological.”  Natural gas for February delivery fell 3.6 cents to $2.991
per million British thermal units, the lowest intraday price
since the fuel traded at $2.911 on Sept. 14, 2009.  About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas has been falling as production at U.S. shale formations
gained. The department said in a separate report yesterday that
gas output in the lower 48 states rose 1.4 percent to 71.28
billion cubic feet a day in October.  Drilling has slowed as gas prices weakened. The number of
rigs drilling for gas has dropped 12 percent this year,
according to data from Baker Hughes Inc. in Houston. The total
rose 7 to 809 this week, a Baker Hughes report yesterday showed.  “You aren’t going to see any material change in gas prices
until you drop at least another hundred rigs,” Cabla said.
“The crux of our argument is that at least 800 U.S. rigs is
still growing natural-gas supply and there is no incremental
demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
