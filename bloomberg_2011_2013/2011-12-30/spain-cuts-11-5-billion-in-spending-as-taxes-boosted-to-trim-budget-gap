Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
announced 14.9 billion euros ($19.3 billion) of deficit cuts,
with the government’s finances in worse shape than expected and
the budget shortfall exceeding European Union forecasts.  The deficit this year will reach 8 percent of gross
domestic product, requiring tax increases of 6 billion euros and
spending reductions of 8.9 billion euros, spokeswoman Soraya
Saenz de Santamaria said at a press conference in Madrid.  Spain 
will finish the year with a budget gap twice that forecast for
 Italy  and more than four times  Germany ’s shortfall.  The stepped up austerity to avoid a bailout may derail
Rajoy’s aim of trimming the country’s rising debt while spurring
a shrinking economy that’s being choked by  Europe ’s highest
unemployment rate. Joblessness of 22 percent helped drive former
Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero ’s Socialist Party
from power in the Nov. 20 elections, when Rajoy won the biggest
parliamentary majority in three decades.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond fell 7 basis
points to 5.097 percent at 4 p.m. in Madrid. Spanish bonds have
been Europe’s best performers since the election, gaining 8
percent since the Nov. 20 vote and providing Rajoy with
breathing space in his task of funding more than 36 billion
euros of maturing debt in the first quarter. Spain is scheduled
to hold its first bond auction of 2012 on Jan. 12.  Higher Taxes  The government plans to raise tax on income, interest on
savings and on high-value homes and maintain a freeze on civil
servant wages. Pensioners will receive a 1 percent increase, a
move that will cost 1.4 billion euros, and the government will
also maintain a special 400-euro a month unemployment benefit, a
popular measures in a country where almost one in four people is
jobless.  The 2011 deficit will exceed the former government’s 6
percent target and top the European Commission forecast of 6.6
and the 6.9 percent median prediction by economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  The measures announced today are to carry the nation
through until a 2012 budget is presented and approved before
March, 31. Rajoy will need to find additional savings to meet
the goal of trimming the deficit to 4.4 percent of GDP next year
and 3 percent in 2013.  The government missed its deficit target due mostly to
bigger shortfalls in Spain’s 17 autonomous regions, Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro said. The PP now rules in the
majority of those region’s and will have to figure out how to
cut those budget gaps amid a shrinking tax base to be able to
meet its future deficit targets. The PP has a chance to gain
control of Andalusia, the country’s most populous region and a
Socialist stronghold, in regional elections in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
