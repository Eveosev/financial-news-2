The Canadian dollar fell against all
of its most-traded counterparts as declines in stocks and crude
oil, the nation’s biggest export, dimmed the appeal of
currencies tied to growth.  Canada ’s currency, dubbed the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, posted declines for the month and
the year. It traded on average above parity with its U.S
counterpart for the first time in more than three decades. The
greenback also weakened against most major peers.  “Typically when the U.S. dollar is offered, the Canadian
dollar loses on the crosses,” said  Marc Chandler , global head
of currency strategy in  New York  at Brown Brothers Harriman &
Co. “There is no liquidity,” he said, referring to market
volumes being lighter than usual.  The loonie was little changed at C$1.0213 per U.S. dollar
at 5 p.m. Toronto time. It touched C$1.0126 two days ago, the
strongest since Dec. 8. One Canadian dollar buys 97.89 U.S.
cents. Canada’s dollar was little changed against the euro at
C$1.3237 after yesterday reaching its highest since January.  Canada’s dollar maintained an average of 98.92 Canadian
cents per  U.S. dollar  in 2011, according to daily closing
prices, the highest annual value since 1976, when it traded at
98.63 Canadian cents, according to Bloomberg data.  The loonie is the second-worst performer this year among
the 10 major currencies monitored by Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Indexes after the euro, down 1.8 percent. The shared
currency lost 2 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.4 percent.
Futures on crude oil declined 0.8 percent to $99.06 a barrel in
New York after earlier falling 1.2 percent. Futures are up 8.4
percent on the year.  Euro Falls  Europe ’s 17-nation currency dropped below 100 yen for the
first time since June 2001 after  Spain  said its  budget deficit 
will reach 8 percent of gross domestic product this year, more
than the previous forecast of 6 percent. Luxembourg’s Jean-
Claude Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance
ministers, said economic growth in the euro region “isn’t
good” and the world economy is growing only in some Asian and
African countries.  Implied volatility for one-month options on the Canadian
dollar versus the greenback rose for a sixth day to as high as
11.1 percent, the most since Dec. 16. Implied volatility, which
traders quote and use to set option prices, signals the expected
pace of swings in the underlying currency. The measure has
averaged 10 percent this year.  Government Bonds  Canada’s benchmark five-year  note (GCAN5YR)  was little changed, with
the yield ending the day at 1.28 percent as the price of the
2.75 percent security due in September 2016 held steady at
C$106.68. Canadian five-year bonds yielded 44 basis points above
equivalent-maturity U.S. securities, from 41 at the end of last
year. The so-called spread hit 33 basis points on Dec. 27, the
narrowest this year. It was as wide as 77 basis points in July.  The nation’s government bonds have returned 9.6 percent
this year, the most since 2008, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data.  Canada’s currency has fallen 0.4 percent this month and 2.3
percent this year against its U.S. counterpart. It strengthened
to 94.07 cents per U.S. dollar, a more than three-year high, on
July 26 and weakened to C$1.0658 on Oct. 4.  The loonie will depreciate to C$1.04 by the end of the
first quarter before rebounding to parity by year-end, according
to median forecasts of 33 analysts and economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Those forecasts compared with C$1.02 and 98 Canadian
cents at the end of November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
