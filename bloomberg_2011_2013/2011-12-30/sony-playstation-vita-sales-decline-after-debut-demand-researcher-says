Sales of  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s PlayStation
Vita, the company’s latest handheld game machine, declined last
week after initial demand at the product’s debut, according to a
researcher Media Create Co.  Sales totaled 72,479 units during the week ended Dec. 25,
down from 324,859 units sold during the two days after the Dec.
17 introduction of the product, the Tokyo-based researcher said
on its  website , without citing anyone.  The device, with a 5-inch display using OLED, or organic
light-emitting diode, technology and touch pads, had sold out in
pre-ordering in  Japan , Andrew House, chief executive of Sony’s
game unit, said earlier this month. Sony introduced Vita, the
first major overhaul of the handheld since the PlayStation
Portable went on sale in 2004, after its bigger rival  Nintendo
Co. (7974)  cut the price for its flagship 3DS model.  Satoshi Fukuoka, a spokesman for Sony’s game unit in  Tokyo ,
declined to comment on the research report.  3DS was the best-selling game device in Japan during the
week with 482,200 units sold, a 31 percent gain from a week
earlier, according to Media Create.  To contact the reporter on this story:
