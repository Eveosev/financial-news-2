Asian  stocks (MXAP)  edged higher, lifted by
signs of U.S. economic recovery, as the region’s benchmark index
ended 2011 with its first annual decline in three years.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, gained 2 percent today in Tokyo. Techtronic
Industries Company Ltd., a maker of industrial products that
gets about 73 percent of its revenue in  North America , added 0.9
percent in Hong Kong.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s No. 1 energy
explorer, advanced 0.4 percent after oil prices gained. Power
Finance Corp. gained 5.1 percent in Mumbai after announcing a
bond sale.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  added 0.4 percent to 113.25 as
of 7:11 p.m. in Tokyo, with all but one of the 10 industry
groups advancing. The measure lost 18 percent this year as  China 
took steps to cool its property market and Europe struggled to
resolve its debt crisis.  “Markets will continue to be unstable for the first
quarter of next year,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , Tokyo-based chief
strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of $24 billion. “European nations will need to unite
as they debate how to rehabilitate the region’s finances. The
leadership will be tested.”  The Asia Pacific gauge has lost about $1.78 trillion this
year amid concern Europe’s three-year debt crisis will drag the
global economy into recession. Stocks on Asia’s benchmark are
valued at 12.6 times estimated earnings on average, compared
with 12.6 times for  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 10.5 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Fukushima Dai-Ichi  Utilities have fallen 26 percent this year, dropping the
most among the 10 industry groups on the Asian gauge. Japanese
power producers tumbled amid a nuclear crisis at Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant. The utility has lost 91
percent this year, the biggest drop on the  MSCI All Country
World Index (MXWD) .  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 0.7 percent today.
Trading volume was 53 percent below the 100-day average ahead of
a four-day weekend. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.2
percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.4 percent. South Korea’s
market was closed today for a holiday.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  slipped less than 0.1 percent.
The gauge advanced 1.1 percent yesterday in  New York  after a
report showed a jump in pending sales of existing homes that
exceeded economist estimates by almost five times.  ‘Data’s Looking Good’  “Investors increasingly feel the  U.S. economy  is firmer
than they had expected,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market
analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “The economic data is looking
good and that will boost stock markets, especially when concern
about Europe’s debt issues aren’t in the forefront.”  Exporters to the U.S rose. Sony added 2 percent to 1,382
yen in Tokyo, while Techtronic Industries rose 0.9 percent to
HK$7.99.  Gains in stocks were limited after Italy yesterday fell
short of its target in a debt auction. Prime Minister Mario
Monti said his government won’t “rule out” more aggressive
efforts to reduce debt.  Inpex advanced 0.4 percent to 485,000 yen after West Texas
Intermediate crude for February delivery gained as much as 0.5
percent to $100.16 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Power Finance (POWF)  rose the most on the Asia Pacific index after
R. Nagarajan, executive director for finance, said the New
Delhi-based company plans to sell at least 1.5 billion rupees
($28 million) of bonds next week. The stock gained 5.1 percent
to 138.75 rupees.  Among other stocks that advanced, Japanese engineering
company  Chiyoda Corp. (6366)  gained 2.1 percent to 783 yen. The Nikkei
newspaper reported the company will likely beat its forecast for
operating profit by up to 3 billion yen ($39 million) in the
year ending March due to lower-than-expected costs on a
liquefied natural gas project in Qatar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
