Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  and  Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. (NDAQ)  agreed to go to arbitration to resolve a fraud
lawsuit filed by Jefferies over interest-rate swap futures
contracts.  Jefferies sued Nasdaq and its International Derivatives
Clearing Group LLC in September in New York state court accusing
them of fraud and breach of contract. Nasdaq had asked the court
to dismiss the complaint or order arbitration.  The two sides “have agreed in principle that this case
shall be resolved through arbitration,” lawyers for the
companies said in a court filing dated yesterday.  Jefferies claimed IDCG and its International Derivatives
unit induced it to enter into the contracts by saying the
investment would be “economically equivalent” to transactions
in similar instruments in the over-the-counter market.  The case is Jefferies & Co. v. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.,
652560-2011,  New York  State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
