Wall Street  lacks influence on
 Capitol Hill  and regulators have the “opportunity to move an
agenda the way they want it,” according to Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  “How powerful is Wall Street on Capitol Hill right now
during an election year?” Hintz said today on Bloomberg
Television. “I don’t think it’s very powerful at all.”  Regulators are crafting language to implement the so-called
Volcker rule included in the Dodd-Frank legislation passed last
year to prohibit deposit-taking banks from making speculative
bets with their own money. Financial firms have lobbied to
weaken regulations created in the aftermath of the 2008
financial crisis, and have asked for a 90-day extension in the
comment period for the Volcker rule.  “For regulators, this is an opportunity for them to move
an agenda the way they want it,” Hintz said. “Unfortunately,
it is not a good picture for the industry going forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
