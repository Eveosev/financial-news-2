The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars traded within 0.7 percent of the lowest in more than a
week against the yen amid concern Europe’s debt crisis is
spreading, sapping demand for riskier assets.  Australian  government bonds  gained, pushing the 10-year
yield to a record low, after  Italy  sold less than its maximum
target at debt auctions yesterday even as borrowing costs fell.
Losses in the so-called Aussie and kiwi dollars were limited on
prospects Asian stocks will extend a global rally in equities.  “I think the risks in Europe will get worse before it gets
better,” said Matt Brady,  executive director  for foreign
exchange at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney. “Risk sentiment is
going to be dire as we head into 2012 and I’m not a believer in
being long any risk currencies.”  The Australian dollar traded at 78.69 yen as of 10:48 a.m.
in Sydney from 78.69 yen yesterday in  New York  when it fell as
low as 78.18, the weakest since Dec. 20. The Aussie fetched
$1.0133 from $1.0137 yesterday, when it touched $1.0044, also
the lowest since Dec. 20.  New Zealand’s dollar bought 59.92 yen from 59.88 yesterday,
when it slipped to a low of 59.57, the least since Dec. 20. It
was at 77.15 U.S. cents from 77.13.  The yield on  Australia ’s 10-year notes fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.67 percent. It earlier
dropped to 3.648 percent, the lowest on record.  The MSCI World Index advanced 0.8 percent yesterday, while
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.1 percent.  Italy yesterday sold 7 billion euros ($9.1 billion) of
debt, falling short of the Treasury’s 8.5 billion-euro target,
bringing the total raised this week to almost 20 billion euros.
Borrowing costs were lower than at previous auctions of similar-
maturity issues. Benchmark 10-year bonds stayed lower after the
auction, with 10-year yields at 7.03 percent at the close.  “I think the bond auction was received OK, but they didn’t
get away the allotment that they wanted,” said JPMorgan’s
Brady. “Certainly with the concerns around  Europe , I have no
reason to believe the world’s a better place at the moment.”  The Australian dollar is poised to end the year 1 percent
lower versus the greenback and 5.2 percent lower versus the yen.
New Zealand’s currency is set to lose 5.2 percent against its
Japanese counterpart and 1.1 percent against the dollar.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
