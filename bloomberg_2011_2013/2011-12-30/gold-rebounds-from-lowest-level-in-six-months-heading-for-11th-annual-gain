Gold rose the most this month,
capping an 11th straight annual advance, on speculation that
demand will climb from jewelers and investors.  Gold fell 4.7 percent in the previous six sessions to the
lowest since July 7 as the dollar gained against the euro,
curbing demand for the metal as an alternative investment. That
may boost seasonal purchases, said Marc Ground, a commodities
strategist at Standard Bank Plc. In the first quarter of 2011,
jewelry demand jumped 12 percent from a year earlier in  India ,
the world’s biggest buyer, according to World Gold Council data.  “While we haven’t seen physical demand pick up yet, maybe
people are anticipating it for next year,” Ground said in a
telephone interview from Johannesburg. “January and February
are usually good months in India, and a lower gold price might
attract some buyers.”  Gold futures for February delivery climbed 1.7 percent to
settle at $1,566.80 an ounce at 1:35 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, ending a six-session slump that was the longest since
March 2009.  While bullion gained 10 percent this year, prices have
plunged as much as 21 percent since touching a record $1,923.70
on Sept. 6.  Dennis Gartman , the economist and editor of the Gartman
Letter, said he is “about to become bullish” after being
neutral since mid-November.  “We did not expect to see gold hold as well as it has or
did in the past 24 hours,” Gartman wrote in his letter e-mailed
today.  Holdings Rise  Holdings (.GLDTONS)  in exchange-traded products backed by bullion are
climbing for the first time in three weeks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Assets rose 0.3 percent this week after
falling 1.5 percent the previous two weeks.  “We are seeing some buyers come in as the market looks
oversold at current levels,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview.  Silver futures for March delivery jumped 2.2 percent to
$27.915 an ounce on the Comex, paring its decline for 2011 to
9.8 percent, the first annual drop since 2008.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
March delivery climbed 5.2 percent to $656.15 an ounce, rising
the most since Oct. 21. The metal still dropped 18 percent in
2011. Platinum futures for April delivery advanced 2.8 percent
to $1,404.90 an ounce. It’s declined 21 percent this year.  Comex floor trading will be closed on Jan. 2 in observance
of the New Year’s holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
