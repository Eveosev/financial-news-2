Dong Energy  A/S, the world’s largest
developer of offshore wind parks, got approval for a project in
Germany’s North Sea with 97 turbines, more than usually allowed.  Construction of Borkum Riffgrund 2, about 37 kilometers (23
miles) northwest of Borkum island, must begin at the latest by
2015, the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency said in an e-
mailed statement today. It will be allowed to exceed the normal
80-turbine limit to help use the area more efficiently.  Germany,  Europe ’s largest electricity market, is pushing
plans for growth of renewable power after deciding to abandon
nuclear energy following the disaster in  Japan ’s Fukushima this
year. The regulator is evaluating applications for 84 parks in
the German North and Baltic Seas and said its approval process
must reflect environmental protection and energy concerns.  “We are satisfied with the approval but we haven’t made an
 investment decision  yet and we don’t have a scheduled time for
this decision,” Ulrik Froehlke, a spokesman for Fredericia,
Denmark-based Dong Energy, said today in a telephone interview.
The utility said in February it would develop the 349-megawatt
project as a second phase of Borkum Riffgrund.  To contact the reporters on this story:
