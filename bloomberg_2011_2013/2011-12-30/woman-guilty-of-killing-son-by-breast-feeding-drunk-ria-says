A Russian woman was sentenced to 3
1/2 years in a prison colony after pleading guilty to nursing
her two-week-old son while drunk, which poisoned him,  RIA
Novosti  reported.  Investigators in the Novgorod region said the woman drank
about a liter of port wine before breast-feeding her son twice,
the state-run news service reported, citing an unidentified aide
to the local prosecutor. The infant died soon after.  To contact the reporter on this story:
