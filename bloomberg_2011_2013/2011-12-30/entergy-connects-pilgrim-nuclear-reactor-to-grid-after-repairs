Entergy Corp. (ETR)  connected the  Pilgrim
1 (NRC1PIL1)  nuclear reactor in Massachusetts to the electric grid after
completing repairs, a company spokesman said.  The 685-megawatt reactor, 4 miles east of Plymouth, started
supplying power to the grid after it was connected at 1:08 p.m.
New York time, Rob Williams, a spokesman for Entergy in
Brattleboro, Vermont, said in an e-mail.  “The plant output is presently about 20 percent power and
is being gradually raised back to full power over the weekend,”
said Williams. The unit was operating at 1 percent capacity
early today, according to a daily update released by the  Nuclear
Regulatory Commission .  Pilgrim 1 was taken offline Dec. 27 to repair one of four
safety-relief valves at the plant. A “minor leak” was found
and the reactor had to be shut down to repair it, according to a
report Entergy submitted to the NRC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
