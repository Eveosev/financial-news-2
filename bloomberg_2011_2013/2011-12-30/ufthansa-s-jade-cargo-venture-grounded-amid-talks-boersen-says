Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s Jade Cargo
joint venture with  Shenzhen Airlines  has grounded its six-plane
fleet as partners discuss its future,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported,
citing a letter the freight carrier sent to employees.  Flights were halted because of a combination of lack of
demand and “extended discussions” with Jade Cargo’s other
owners, the German newspaper said, citing the letter. Jade’s six
 Boeing Co. (BA)  747 freighters also lack fuel, Boersen-Zeitung
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Andreas Otto, sales chief at the German airline’s Lufthansa
Cargo unit, said in November that the carrier had set a deadline
of the end of 2011 to reach an agreement with Shenzhen Airlines
on providing Jade Cargo with more cash. The venture is also
part-owned by  Germany ’s state-owned development bank KfW Group.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
