Chinese equities (CH55BN)  traded in the U.S.
posted the first annual decline in three years as the world’s 
second-largest economy slowed amid  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. slid 8.3 percent this year to 95.85 yesterday
in  New York . The gauge gained 34 percent in 2010 and 35 percent
in 2009.  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  was the worst performer
on the measure with an 84 percent decline this year, while solar
stocks sank at least 58 percent as the industry struggles with
falling prices. Macau casino operator  Melco Crown Entertainment
Ltd. (MPEL)  led gains with a 51 percent jump.  China’s economy  expanded at the slowest pace in two years,
prompting policy makers to cut the amount of cash lenders must
set aside as reserves Nov. 25 in a bid to stoke growth. The debt
crisis in Europe,  China ’s biggest overseas market, crimped
demand for  exports (CNFREXPY) , which also rose the least in two years.  “2011 was clearly fear dominated,” Jeff Papp, a Lisle,
Illinois-based senior analyst at Oberweis Asset Management Inc.,
which helps invest $700 million in China, said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television. The government’s multiple tightening
measures since 2010 to tackle inflation “led investors to
believe Chinese growth would fall off the cliff.”  The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 22 percent for the year,
the biggest slide since 2008 and the worst performance after
 India  among benchmarks in the so-called BRIC nations. The
Shanghai measure is trading at an estimated price-earnings ratio
of 10.6 times. That compares with 13.5 for Indian stocks, 10 for
Brazilian shares and 5 for Russian equities.  Dangdang  Dangdang, as the online retailer and China’s biggest
Internet bookseller is known, posted losses in the past two
quarters as increasing competition cut profit margins.  The adjusted third-quarter net loss was 71.1 million yuan
($11.3 million), compared with a loss of 25.8 million yuan in
the previous three months and net income of 37.2 million a year
ago. Dangdang’s American depositary receipts, each of which
represents five common shares, have dropped 73 percent to $4.29
since its initial public offering Dec. 7, 2010.  Dangdang’s “book business is slowing down and it would
lose a lot of money to sell things other than books due to high
costs of logistics,” Muzhi Li, an analyst at Mizuho Securities
Asia Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed response to questions. “The
best hope for it is to get acquired and consolidated into a big
media platform.”  Yuan Strengthens  The ishares FTSE China 25  Index (BLGS)  Fund, the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., retreated 19 percent in 2011
to $34.87, after a 2 percent increase the prior year. The
Chinese yuan climbed 0.4 percent to 6.2940 a dollar on Dec. 30,
rising beyond 6.3 per dollar for the first time in 18 years. It
has appreciated 4.7 percent for the year, the best performance
among the 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Suntech Power Holdings Co., the world’s largest maker of
solar panels, sank 72 percent in New York trading this year to
$2.21, losing the most among the four solar companies in the
Bloomberg measure of U.S.-traded Chinese stocks. The Bloomberg
Global Leaders Solar Index fell 59 percent in 2011, following a
22 percent decline in 2010.  China’s solar-panel supply glut will force consolidation
and likely slash the number of domestic manufacturers to 15
within half a decade, Li Junfeng, deputy director general of the
Beijing-based Energy Research Institute at the nation’s top
economic planning agency, said in an interview Nov. 29. There
were 330 panel makers in 2008, according to the Chinese
Renewable Energy Society.  Growing Competition  The 10 largest makers of traditional silicon panels,
including Suntech and LDK Solar Co., together doubled capacity
in 2010, data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance show.  Trina
Solar Ltd. (TSL) , the fifth-largest solar-panel supplier, will raise
module and cell capacity more than 26 percent next year, it said
in a Dec. 28 statement.  The Chinese government said this week it will discourage
foreign investment in polysilicon, the raw material used in
solar panels, curbing supply in the industry. India may initiate
an anti-dumping probe in a month focused on imports of Chinese
solar products, China’s Commerce Ministry said Dec. 19, as U.S.-
China trade fight over solar energy escalated.  Average prices for solar modules have declined 47 percent
this year to $0.94 a watt, according to Bloomberg New Energy.  Trina’s ADRs fell 1.9 percent on Dec. 30 to $6.68 in New
York, bringing its loss this year to 71 percent.  Yingli Green
Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  slid 1 percent Dec. 30 and 62 percent in 2011
to $3.80. LDK sank 59 percent for the year to $4.19.  Economic Growth  China’s economy expanded 9.1 percent in the third quarter
from a year earlier, down from 9.5 percent growth in the second
quarter. Consumer prices rose 4.2 percent in November from a
year ago, the slowest pace in 14 months.  The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing will
report on Jan. 1 an official manufacturing index for December.
The gauge will be little changed at 49.1, according to the
median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
measure contracted to 49 in November from 50.4 a month earlier.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Melco Crown’s ADRs advanced 2.8 percent on Dec. 30 in New
York to $9.62. The shares surged 51 percent for the year, the
biggest jump among companies in the Bloomberg measure.  NetEase.com (NTES)  Inc., China’s second-largest online game
provider, surged 24 percent, the best performer among Internet
companies in 2011, followed by a 21 percent increase in Baidu
Inc., the country’s largest online search engine.  Baidu’s dominance won’t be challenged anytime soon,
Mizuho’s Li said in the e-mail. “Baidu is the safest stock to
put money on in China’s Internet space,” he said, adding
NetEase may see a challenging 2012 because the online game
market is maturing and as it tries to expand into the e-commerce
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
