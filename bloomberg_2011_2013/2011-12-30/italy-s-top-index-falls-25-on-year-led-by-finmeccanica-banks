Italy ’s benchmark FTSE MIB Index
closed with a 25 percent yearly decline, the worse performance
out of Europe’s top five national indices, dragged down by
defense company  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  and banking stocks.  The FTSE MIB fared worse than France’s  CAC 40 (CAC) , which had a
17 percent slump in the same period, and Germany’s DAX, which
dropped 15 percent. Spain’s  IBEX 35 (IBEX)  had a 13 percent decline and
the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  fell 5.6 percent.  Finmeccanica, Italy’s biggest defense company, was the
worst performer, losing 66 percent in Milan trading after a
record 790 million-euro third-quarter loss and the resignation
of Chief Executive Officer Pier Francesco Guarguaglini amid a
corruption probe involving company executives.  Italian banks also penalized the index with  Banca Monte dei
Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  falling 65 percent and 59
percent respectively on the year. Both lenders have had to raise
capital to strengthen finances. The European Banking authority
said earlier this month that UniCredit needs to raise 8 billion
euros of additional capital, the second-highest amount among the
region’s banks after Spain’s Banco Santander SA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
