Fortune Real Estate Investment Trust (778) 
hired Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., DBS Bank
Ltd. and  Standard Chartered  Plc to arrange and underwrite a
HK$1.4 billion ($180 million) three-year loan, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  The three banks will begin marketing the facility to other
lenders in January, said the person who asked not to be
identified because the details are private.  The loan comprises a HK$1.1 billion  term loan  and a HK$300
million revolving credit facility and pays a margin of 200 basis
points over the Hong Kong interbank offered rate, according to a
filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Proceeds of the term loan are for Fortune REITâ€™s intended
acquisition of two retail properties in  Hong Kong , Belvedere
Garden Property and Provident Centre Property, purchased for
HK$1.25 billion and HK$650 million respectively, according to
the statement. The loan is secured by rentals, deposits, and
proceeds from properties.  Fortune will also use an existing revolving credit facility
of HK$970 million due 2016 to fund the acquisitions. That
facility pays a margin of 91 basis points more than Hibor,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ANZ, DBS and Standard
Chartered were bookrunners on the existing HK$970 million
facility, said the person today.  Singapore-based Fortune has the equivalent of $489 million
in loans  maturing (778)  before the end of 2016, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
