Ford Motor Co. (F)  said its namesake
brand exceeded 2 million U.S. sales for the first year since
2007, led by gains for models such as the Fiesta small car and
revamped Explorer sport-utility vehicle.  Smaller cars such as the Fiesta and Focus are on pace for a
sales increase of more than 20 percent this year while light
trucks that include the Explorer, Escape SUV and F-150 pickup
may rise at least 30 percent, the Dearborn, Michigan-based
company said today in a statement.  Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, is benefiting from
an auto market that rose 10 percent through November from a year
earlier. The company’s sales also got a boost from vehicles such
as the Fiesta, which debuted in the U.S. in June 2010 and has
more than tripled this year through last month, and the
Explorer, which has more than doubled.  “The industry sales rate has exceeded 13 million in each
of the last three months,”  Ken Czubay , Ford’s vice president
for U.S. sales and marketing, said in the statement. “This
suggests the current momentum is not an aberration.”  Ford-brand sales gained 18 percent to 1.86 million through
November, compared with 1.76 million for all of 2010. Ford’s
total U.S. sales through November increased 11 percent.  The automaker reported  net income (F)  of $6.6 billion in this
year’s first nine months. Ford gained consumer consideration as
it managed to avoid the bankruptcies that befell its U.S. rivals
in 2009. The company borrowed $23.4 billion in late 2006 before
credit markets froze, giving it the cash to weather the
recession and invest in new models.  Ford rose 0.7 percent to $10.76 at the close in  New York .
The  shares (F)  fell 36 percent this year, the first  annual (F)  drop
since 2008, when they ended the year at $2.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
