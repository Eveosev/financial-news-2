Commercial-mortgage bond holdings
probably will not suffer from Sears Holdings Corp.’s closing of
as many as 120 stores, according to  Fitch Ratings .  Kmart or Sears is listed as the tenant on 255 loans
packaged into the securities, Fitch said in a statement
yesterday. The value of these loans is $7.74 billion, according
to a statement from the rating company in  New York .  Fitch “sees little risk of a negative impact on CMBS,”
according to the statement.  The largest U.S. department store chain reported that it
would close as many as 120 locations after same-store sales fell
5.2 percent in the eight weeks ended Dec. 25. Sears is the
second-largest tenant in the $600 billion commercial-mortgage
backed  securities market , with stores found in 197 deals,
 Standard & Poor’s  said in note to clients yesterday.  Fitch said 27 loans, totaling $156.8 million, are single-
tenant buildings secured by a Sears or Kmart store. The majority
of these mortgages are contained in transactions sold between
2005 and 2008, according to Fitch.  The highest single-tenant concentration is a $5.26 million
loan secured by a stand-alone Kmart in Maui,  Hawaii . The store
was not on a  partial list  of stores to be closed released by
Sears yesterday.  Top-ranked bonds tied to shopping malls, office buildings
and hotels are yielding 259 basis points more than Treasuries
through yesterday, unchanged from a week earlier, according to
the Barclays Capital CMBS AAA Super Duper index. The spread has
narrowed after soaring to a 20-month high of 323 basis points on
Oct. 4 amid the European debt crisis. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
