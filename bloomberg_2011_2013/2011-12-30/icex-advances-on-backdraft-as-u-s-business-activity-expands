Russia ’s benchmark stock index
gained for a second day after better-than-forecast U.S.
manufacturing data indicated the world’s largest economy is
weathering  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  increased 1.1 percent to 1,402.23
at the end of trading in Moscow, narrowing the yearly loss to 17
percent. The dollar-measured  RTS Index (RTSI$)  rose 1.2 percent to
1,381.87, trimming the annual decrease to 22 percent.  U.S. business activity expanded in December, prompting
companies to boost employment. The Institute for Supply
Management-Chicago Inc. reported its business barometer at 62.5
this month, higher than the median forecast of 61 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. A recovery in U.S. manufacturing may help
bolster the price of oil and gas, Russia’s largest export
earners.  “Very few investors are active today so what we are seeing
is the backdraft from yesterday’s gain on  Wall Street ,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Troika Dialog, Russia’s oldest
investment bank, said in an e-mail comment.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index advanced 1.1 percent to
1,263.02 yesterday as U.S. jobless claims dropped to a three-
year low and pending sales of existing homes jumped in November
for a second month, pointing to a pickup in the country’s
economic growth.  OAO Aeroflot (AFLT) , Russia’s biggest airline, gained 5.5 percent
to 50.54 rubles. The airline said it carried more than 14
million passengers this year, a record. Including its units, the
group carried more than 20 million people.  OAO Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest producer of coal for
steelmakers, climbed 6.5 percent to 270.60 rubles, the steepest
jump since Nov. 30.  United Co. Rusal (RUALR) , the world’s biggest
aluminum producer, gained 1.5 percent to 196.01 rubles.  Russian services-industry growth slowed in December for the
first time in four months, HSBC Holdings Plc said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
