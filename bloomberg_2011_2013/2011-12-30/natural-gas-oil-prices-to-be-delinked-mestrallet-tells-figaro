The price of natural gas in the
future wonâ€™t automatically track the price of crude because of
growing demand,  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet told  Le Figaro  in an interview.  Natural gas will gain more importance in the energy mix of
countries and will help compensate for the slowdown in nuclear
power, Mestrallet also told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
