London  will be the center of world
attention in 2012 -- and from the very first hours of the New
Year.  As the city prepares to host the Olympic and Paralympic
Games, a spectacular fireworks display is set to light up the
southern banks of the Thames. The aim is to start 2012 “not
with a timid whimper, but a colorful bang,” says  Mayor   Boris Johnson . The pyrotechnics are produced by  Jack Morton Worldwide ,
with a special soundtrack by Radio 1’s DJ  Nihal .  If you decide to head over tomorrow, you’ll be one in an
estimated 200,000 people. Get there early -- designated  viewing
areas  close down as soon as they reach capacity. Information:

overlooking the Thames, offers fabulous views. On New Year’s
Eve, gala dinner guests can watch the fireworks from a private
room on the sixth floor of the Royal Festival Hall, then head
back to their table for live music and dancing. Tickets,
including a five-course meal, are 240 pounds ($370) a pop.

Galvin at Windows, on the 28th floor of the London Hilton. The
five-course New Year’s Eve dinner, with Champagne and canapes as
well as live music, is 395 pounds. Information: +44-20-7208-4021
or  http://bit.ly/tDDdjf .  Saturday Night Ritz  For deeper pockets, the Ritz Restaurant -- London’s most
spectacular dining room -- is serving dinner at 1,150 pounds a
head. That ticket (approximately $1,800) buys you a six-course
meal, a live-music dance floor, a regimental marching band, a
lone piper, and fireworks in the garden. If you have kids with
you, they pay a mere 750 pounds each. Just take it out of their
allowance. Information: +44-7493-8181 or  http://bit.ly/qypgR9 .  By comparison, dinner at  Alain Ducasse  at the Dorchester is
a steal -- at 495 pounds (including wine) for grownups. The
restaurant doesn’t welcome children, so it’s savings all around.
Information: +44-20-7629-8866 or  http://bit.ly/vD8clU .  You can spend less and still be fashionable at Nobu
Berkeley Street, which has a special menu at 90 pounds, or 150
pounds with matching wines. At trendy Momo’s, the 90 pound menu
includes a glass of Pommery and mains such as white truffle
risotto and lobster tagine with new potatoes and lobster bisque.  For those who prefer loud music to a sit-down dinner or
“Auld Lang Syne,” Kasabian will be taking over the  O2 . The
British quartet is avoiding charges that they’re Oasis copycats
by offering more ambitious rock on the album “Velociraptor!”  Double Nutcrackers  Ballet aficionados have two versions of “Nutcracker” to
pick from. The Royal Ballet’s stays close to tradition, casting
principals Alina Cojocaru (at 12:30 p.m.) and Lauren Cuthbertson
(at 5:30 p.m.) in the story of a little girl who sneaks down to
peek at her Christmas presents and watches all of her toys come
alive. Information:  http://www.roh.org.uk  or +44-20-7304-4000.  Choreographer Matthew Bourne presents his alternative
version at Sadler’s Wells, with polka dots and pajamas in place
of tutus and tiaras. Information:   http://www.sadlerswells.com .  Sunday Morning  If you’re not too bleary-eyed the morning after, there’s a
New Year’s Day parade weaving its way through London, starting
on Piccadilly at 11:45 a.m. and heading for Trafalgar Square,
Whitehall and Parliament Street. More than 10,000 performers
from 20 countries around the world will take part. The parade
ends at 3 p.m. Information:  http://www.londonparade.co.uk/ .  (Farah Nayeri and Richard Vines write for Muse, the arts
