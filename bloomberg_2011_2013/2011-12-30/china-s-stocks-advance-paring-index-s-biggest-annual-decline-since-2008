China’s stocks (SHCOMP)  advanced, trimming
the benchmark index’s biggest annual loss since 2008, as
increasing U.S. home sales bolstered confidence in the world’s
largest economy.  FAW Car Co. (000800) , which makes passenger cars in China with
Volkswagen AG, climbed 4.7 percent after the company received
regulatory approve to buy an affiliate’s stake. Jiangxi Copper
Co. and zinc producer Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co. paced gains by
commodity producers after copper prices increased. Stocks rose
even after manufacturing contracted for a second month.  “We have high inflation, an economic slowdown and very
tight  money supply  this year and that’s a picture of stagflation
that is pretty negative for equities,” said Wei Wei, an analyst
at West China Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “The stock market may
find a bottom next year given cheap valuations. But in terms of
economic fundamentals, we haven’t seen an end to the slowdown.”  The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 25.86 points, or 1.2
percent, to 2,199.42 at the close, its biggest gain in two
weeks. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 1.5 percent to 2,345.74. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, added 0.8 percent yesterday in  New York . China’s
markets will be shut until Jan. 4 for holidays.  World’s Worst  The Shanghai Composite tumbled 22 percent this year, the
most since 2008 and extending last year’s 14 percent plunge, on
concern increases in borrowing costs and  Europe ’s debt crisis
will derail economic growth. The index’s 33 percent drop since
2009 makes it the worst performer among the world’s 15 biggest
markets.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said a purchasing
managers’ index was at 48.7 in December. That compares with a
preliminary result of 49 reported on Dec. 15 and a final reading
of 47.7 for November. China’s economic growth will slow to 8.5
percent in 2012, the least in 11 years, according to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Stock declines have pushed the Shanghai gauge to trade at a
record low of 10.6 times estimated earnings, according to weekly
 data (SHCOMP)  compiled by Bloomberg. The value of stocks traded in
Shanghai slumped yesterday to the weakest level in three years.  The first announced cut in reserve requirement ratios by
the central bank since 2008 on Nov. 30 failed to boost stocks,
with the Shanghai Composite down 5.7 percent in December. The
People’s Bank of China raised  interest rates  three times and
reserve requirement ratios six times this year to cool inflation
that accelerated to its fastest pace in three years in July.  Group Movers  All 10  industry groups (SHSZ300)  in the CSI 300 lost more than 9
percent this year, with gauges of industrial companies,
materials producers and technology firms sliding more than 35
percent. A measure tracking consumer-staples companies dropped
9.9 percent, the least among the 10 groups.  Commodity producers gained today as better-than-expected
U.S. data boosted confidence that a recovery in the second-
largest consumer will support demand.  Jiangxi Copper (600362) , China’s biggest producer of the metal,
added 2.2 percent to 21.93 yuan, paring its loss this year to 51
percent. Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co., the second
largest, climbed 4.9 percent to 16.81 yuan. Zhuzhou Smelter,
China’s biggest producer of refined zinc, rose 3 percent to 9.21
yuan.  Copper for delivery in three months gained as much as 1.4
percent to $7,526.75 a metric ton, paring the first annual
decline since 2008. The contract has retreated 22 percent this
year, after climbing to a record $10,190 a ton on Feb. 15.  U.S. Boost  The number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits
dropped to 375,000 on average over the past four weeks, the
fewest since June 2008, while the U.S. Chicago Purchasing
Managers Index and pending sales of existing homes both
surpassed the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  FAW Car gained 4.7 percent to 8.85 yuan. The automaker
received approval from  China ’s state-owned assets regulator to
acquire a stake in Tianjin FAW Xiali Automobile Co. from its
parent China FAW Group Corp., Xiali said in an exchange
statement.  December  inflation (CNCPIYOY)  may have rebounded to 4.4 percent this
month as gains in food prices accelerated ahead of the Chinese
new year in January,  Li Huiyong  and Meng Xiangjuan, analysts at
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., wrote in a report today. The
current slowdown in economic growth isn’t weak enough to prompt
the government to increase investment to boost the economy, the
report said.  Overseas Funds  The China Securities Regulatory Commission accelerated the
pace of approving qualified foreign institutional investors in
December, the Shanghai Securities News said today, without
saying where it got the information. About 10 overseas
institutional investors received approval this month, compared
with two in November, and 13 in the first 10 months of the year,
according to the newspaper.  Zhejiang King Refrigeration Industry Co., which
manufactures air-conditioning equipment, is the best-performing
stock in the Shanghai Composite this year with a 195 percent
jump, while  IRICO Display Devices Co. (600707) , a producer of television
picture tubes, dropped the most with a 66 percent slump.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
