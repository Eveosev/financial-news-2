Telekom Srbija  and  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA (HTO) , or OTE, signed an agreement
today in Athens for the Greek company to sell a 20 percent stake
in the Serb national fixed-line and mobile-service provider back
to Telekom Srbija.  The value of the transaction is 380 million euros ($491.8
million), Telekom Srbija said in an e-mailed statement. The
transaction will be completed by the end of the first quarter in
2012 and result in the Serbian company being completely state-
owned again.  Hellenic Telecom will receive a minimum dividend of 17
million euros for 2011 from the deal, the Athens-based company
said in a separate e-mailed statement today.  The deal “will have a positive impact on our  cash flow  and
is part of our strategy to reduce OTE’s net debt,” Hellenic
Telecom’s Chief Executive Officer Michael Tsamaz said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
