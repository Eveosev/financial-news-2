Miami Dolphins  running back Reggie Bush will miss his team’s regular-season finale against the  New
York Jets  due to a knee injury.  Bush suffered the right knee injury late in the Dolphins’
Dec. 24 loss to the New England Patriots. He was held out of
practice this week and the team has ruled out playing him,
Harvey Greene, a Dolphins spokesman, said in an e-mail
confirming interim coach Todd Bowles’s comments to reporters
today.  “He hasn’t been responding so we’re just going to sit him
down,” Bowles said, according to the Miami Herald.  Bush, a six-year National Football League veteran, broke
the 1,000-yard mark for the first time in his career before
suffering the injury. He has 1,086 rushing yards this season,
averaging five yards a carry.  The Dolphins (5-10) have been eliminated from playoff
contention while the Jets (8-7) must win the game in Miami and
rely on losses by the  Cincinnati Bengals , Tennessee Titans and
either the Oakland Raiders or Denver Broncos to claim one of two
wild-card playoff berths.  To contact the reporter on this story:
