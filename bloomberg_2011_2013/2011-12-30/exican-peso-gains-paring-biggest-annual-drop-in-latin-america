Mexico ’s peso posted the biggest
currency drop in  Latin America  in 2011 amid concern that
Europe’s debt crisis will erode appetite for the Latin American
country’s exports.  The peso strengthened 0.4 percent to 13.9357 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Mexico City, from 13.9966 yesterday. The
currency fell 11.5 percent this year. It touched a four-week low
of 14.0424 on Dec. 27.  The peso held near 14 per U.S. dollar amid low liquidity,
said  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Base Internacional Casa
de Bolsa in Monterrey, Mexico. Emerging-market assets have
slumped in 2011 as Europe’s debt crisis has damped expectations
for global growth. Mexico’s currency fell 2.2 percent this month
as euro-region leaders failed to ease investor concerns.  “It’s just overall concern,”  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-
based economist for Latin America at 4Cast Inc, said by phone.
“If the solution to the European crisis is disorderly, that is
probably going to affect the U.S. If the U.S. is affected,
Mexico is also going to be.”  Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  The yield on the peso-denominated bonds due in 2024 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.67 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.21
centavo to 128.85 centavos per peso. The yield on security
declined 53 basis points in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
