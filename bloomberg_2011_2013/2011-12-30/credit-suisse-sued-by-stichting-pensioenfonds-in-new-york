Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-
biggest Swiss bank, was sued in New York state court by Dutch
pension fund  Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP (ADPZ)  over losses on
investments in mortgage securities.  Credit Suisse sold securities that were backed by low-
quality loans and turned out to be “far riskier” than
promised, ABP said in a complaint filed yesterday in  Manhattan .  The pension fund said Zurich-based Credit Suisse knew of
“the wholesale and systematic abandonment” of underwriting
guidelines by loan originators, leading to high default and
delinquency rates by borrowers.  ABP said it has suffered “substantial losses” on the
securities and that it’s increasingly probable that it would not
obtain the full payments it expected. A lawyer for ABP couldn’t
be reached for comment about the amount of securities at issue
in the lawsuit.  Steven Vames, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to
immediately comment.  The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v.  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CS) , 653665-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
