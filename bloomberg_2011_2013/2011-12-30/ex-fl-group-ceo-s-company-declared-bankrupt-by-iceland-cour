FI Investments ehf, a company
created by former FL Group hf Chief Executive Officer Hannes Smarason, was declared bankrupt by the Reykjavik District Court.  The company, formerly known as Primus Investments ehf, was
declared bankrupt on Dec. 16, according to a  journal  containing
legal decisions published today by the government.  By the end of 2007, FI Investments took out two loans
totaling 4.7 billion kronur ($38 million) from failed lender
 Glitnir Bank hf (GLB) , a Special Investigative Committee appointed by
the Reykjavik-based parliament found in April last year.  Smarason personally guaranteed 400 million kronur when the
loans were granted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
