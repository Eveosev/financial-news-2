More than twice as many new carbon
credits were supplied to the world’s second-biggest emissions
market this year, damping prospects for a recovery from record-
low prices in 2012.  The UN Clean Development Mechanism will generate a record
of about 320 million Certified Emission Reduction credits in
2011, up from 132 million last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. While a 62 percent drop in UN prices may
discourage new supply, Bloomberg New Energy Finance cut its 2012
price forecast this month as it estimated the glut of so-called
CERs will be bigger than previously estimated.  “The outlook for the CDM is quite gloomy,” said Matteo Mazzoni, an analyst at Nomisma Energia in Bologna,  Italy , who
estimates 275 million tons of CERs will be issued next year.
“We believe there’s going to be a sort of slowdown given
current, unattractive prices,” he said by e-mail.  A surge in CERs from projects that destroy industrial gases
known as hydrofluorocarbon-23 and nitrous oxide has led to a
supply glut this year. The European Union will stop recognizing
most of this category in May 2013, prompting investors to issue
credits to beat that deadline just as Europe’s debt crisis and a
UN climate summit that failed to boost demand before 2015
exacerbate the bearish outlook for global carbon markets.  CERs fell to a record low of 3.80 euros ($4.92) on Dec. 14,
a 60 percent decline in 2011 for the contract that expired
earlier this month on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London.
CERs for delivery in December 2012 rose 3.2 percent to 4.20
euros as of 12:15 p.m. after reaching a low of 3.84 euros on
Dec. 14.  EU Market  Allowances in the EU, which lets 11,000 power stations and
manufacturers in the world’s biggest emissions-trading system
use as many as 1.7 million UN offsets through 2020, are poised
for a 50 percent drop this year on ICE. They rose 0.3 percent
today to 7.28 euros.  Created in 2005, the CDM is the UN’s main market tool for
encouraging investment in pollution-cutting projects, such as
using waste to make electricity and eliminating flaring of
natural gas. The program allows richer nations to “offset”
their emissions produced at home by paying for cleaner
technology in  emerging markets .  Investors in these projects get CERs they can sell to
companies and governments that are bound by pollution caps.
While the EU is the largest market for UN offsets, Australia
will allow emitters to use CERs for as much as half their
emissions starting in 2015.  Falling Prices  New supply of CERs may drop 13 percent to about 280 million
tons next year as falling prices prompt developers to delay
seeking credits from the CDM Executive Board based in Bonn, the
regulator, according to Orbeo, the Paris-based joint venture of
 Societe Generale SA (GLE)  and  Rhodia SA (SOLB)  that trades emission credits.  “For 2012, we expect CER issuances to be below the amount
of 2011,” said Carine Hemery, a strategist with Orbeo. “CER
price levels should limit the interest in requesting for
issuance.”  Even if the  supply of CERs (CERSTOTL)  grows more slowly, the market is
in danger of having more credits than emitters will demand
through 2020, New Energy Finance analysts led by  Guy Turner  and
Matthew Cowie said in a Dec. 22 report. The analysts cut their
2012 price forecast to 5.70 euros a ton this month from last
month’s estimate of 7.90 euros, as demand for credits declined
at a time when supply is still increasing.  “If supply keeps rising due to projects entering the CDM
pipeline, we expect to be approaching the tipping point on an
oversupplied market where existing supply will be more than
enough to satisfy global demand,” according to the New Energy
report.  Durban Talks  Officials from almost 200 nations agreed on Dec. 11 at UN
climate talks in Durban,  South Africa , to seek a global climate-
protection deal by 2015, with the participation for the first
time of the U.S.,  China  and  India . Until that agreement is
reached, it’s not clear whether there will be much demand for
emission offsets outside Europe,  Australia  and  New Zealand .  The average price for CERs was 12.11 euros in the first
half of 2011, making investment in cutting emissions more
profitable than now. It usually takes at least six months for
credits to be issued once projects are submitted, UN data show.
Each CER credit corresponds to the equivalent of one ton of
carbon dioxide avoided.  Issuance of credits linked to the reduction of industrial
gases hydrofluorocarbon-23 and nitrous oxide are set to rise
before the EU ban, even as the overall new supply falls next
year. This sub-category of offset projects, known as HFC-23 and
N2O, accounted for 64 percent of all CERs issued through the end
of 2011, according to Bloomberg calculations using UN data. They
also represent 81 percent of all CDM credits used for compliance
in the EU carbon market from 2008 through 2010.  EU Ban  The 27-nation EU decided last year to prohibit the use of
HFC-23 offsets and N2O credits linked to adipic acid as of May
2013. The European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm in
Brussels, has said the credits offer “exorbitant” return
rates, can create a “perverse incentive” for investors and
undermine the market’s environmental integrity.  Total supply of offset credits in the nine years through
2020, including those from the smaller Joint Implementation
program, will be 4.7 billion tons, according to a Nov. 14
forecast by Barclays Capital analyst  Trevor Sikorski . Demand,
including that from the EU carbon market, will be 3.2 billion
tons, leaving an oversupply of 1.5 billion tons, he said.  Credit supply may surge to a record next year, said Per
Lekander, an analyst for UBS AG in Paris. “CERs will not go
back to the 2012 level for a long time, if ever,” he said by e-
mail. “I have an estimate of 360 million tons total CERs for
2012. I think it is credible, possibly on the low side.”  Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast Dec. 22 that CER
prices will be 6.34 euros a ton in 2020, compared with 51.93
euros a ton for EU permits.  To contact the reporters on this story:
