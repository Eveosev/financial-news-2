Irish consumer lenders’ reliance on
European Central Bank funding increased by 1.6 billion euros
($2.1 billion) to 73.1 billion euros in November, according to
the country’s central bank.  Irish resident private-sector deposits fell by an
underlying 1.3 billion euros during November, driven by a 1.2
billion-euro decline in household deposits, the Dublin-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Irish private-sector
deposits stood at 162.1 billion euros, it said.  Total deposits from other euro-area residents increased by
1.6 billion euros in the month, it said. Private-sector deposits
from non-euro-area residents fell by 2.5 billion euros, with all
the outflows in this category relating to lenders based in the
International Financial Services Centre in Dublin, the central
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
