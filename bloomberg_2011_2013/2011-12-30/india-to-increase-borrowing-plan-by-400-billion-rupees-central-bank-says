India  increased its record borrowing
program for the year by 8.5 percent to narrow a budget shortfall
as a slowing economy damps tax collections.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government will sell an
additional 400 billion rupees ($7.5 billion) of bonds in the
year ending March 31 raising an unprecedented total of 5.1
trillion rupees, the central bank said in a statement today.  Indian 10-year benchmark bond  yields (GIND10YR)  have jumped the most
in  Asia  after  Vietnam , as the government sold more debt to meet
its target of keeping the budget gap to 4.6 percent of gross
domestic product. The rate on the 8.79 percent note due November
2021 climbed two basis points today and 20 this week to 8.57
percent, according to the central bank’s trading system.  “The market is already burdened by supplies,” Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at  Development Credit Bank
Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “However this increase was expected, and so
while we could see yields rising in early trades on Monday, they
will settle down soon.”  The 10-year bond yield could rise as high as 8.70 percent,
according to Development Credit Bank and  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI) 
following the increase in the bond-sale plan.  The  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  has said the government must rein
in borrowings to help check price gains and boost economic
growth. The $1.7 trillion economy may miss the central bank’s
growth estimate of 7.6 percent for the 12 months ending March
31, Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said Dec. 22.  The government increased its borrowing plan by 528.7
billion rupees in September.  Wider Spread  The nation’s indirect tax revenue rose 16.9 percent in the
eight months through November from a year earlier, S.K. Goel,
chairman of the Central Board of Excise and Customs, said Dec.
9. That compares with a target for a 17.3 percent increase this
fiscal year.  The  extra yield (GIND10YR)  sought on the notes over similar maturity
 U.S. Treasuries  surged 205 basis points in 2011 to 667 basis
points. The spread reached a 12-year high of 697 basis points in
November.  Rupee-denominated notes returned 5.9 percent this year
compared with the region’s best performance of 22 percent for
Indonesian securities, HSBC Holdings Plc indexes show. Overseas
investors raised  holdings (FIINDEBT)  of Indian debt by $8.5 billion this
year to a record $26.3 billion on Dec. 23, exchange data show.  “Government borrowing is pressuring the yields upward,”
said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager of treasury at  Federal
Bank Ltd. (FB)  in Mumbai. “But the slowing economy will force an
interest-rate cut next year and so yields should move downward
in 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
