The number of people saving in
private-pension plans in Britain has fallen to the lowest level
in the past 10 years, the government said.  Only 38 percent of working-age people -- 11.6 million out
of 30.4 million -- are putting money into retirement plans, the
 Department for Work and Pensions  in London said in an e-mailed
statement today. That’s down from 46 percent in 2000.  “With fewer people saving into a pension, lower annuity
rates and an average of 23 years in retirement, many people
could face a poorer future in their later lives,” Pensions
Minister Steve Webb said in the statement. “We simply must put
a stop to this trend and get people saving.”  The government has introduced changes to pension rules
under which companies will have to enroll employees
automatically in a  pension plan  starting in 2012. At the same
time, it’s curbing the more generous pension entitlements for
public-sector workers, a step that prompted a one-day strike
last month.  The decline in private pension saving is biggest among men
and people below age 40, the DWP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
