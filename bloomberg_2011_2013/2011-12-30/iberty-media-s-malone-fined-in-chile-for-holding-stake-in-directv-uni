Chile’s antitrust tribunal fined
John C. Malone, the billionaire owner of  Liberty Media Corp. (LINTA) ,
$3.6 million for failing to abide by conditions imposed on the
merger of his cable-television company with a competitor.  The tribunal, known as TDLC, said Malone would face
additional sanctions if he doesn’t sell within six months his
direct and indirect stakes in satellite-television provider
DirecTV Chile SA, a rival of Liberty’s VTR Globalcom SA,
according to a statement posted on the tribunal’s website.  Chile’s National Economic Prosecutor sued Malone in 2008,
arguing that when VTR received approval to merge with cable TV
operator Metropolis Intercom SA in 2004, it had agreed not to
own stakes in other paid TV operators in the country.  Liberty acquired an interest in  DirecTV (DTV)  in 2008 from Rupert
Murdoch’s News Corp.  “Mr. Malone was aware of the conditions imposed on the
merger, and still maintains a stake in DirecTV Chile even after
being warned by the National Economic Prosecutor,” the TDLC
wrote in its ruling.  Courtnee Ulrich, a spokeswoman for Englewood, Colorado-
based Liberty, didn’t respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
