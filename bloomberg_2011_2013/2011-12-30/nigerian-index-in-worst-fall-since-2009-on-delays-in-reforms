Nigerian stocks (NGSEINDX)  fell the most this
year since 2009 on delays in implementing banking reforms,
increased instability, and Europe’s debt crisis combined to sap
demand for emerging-market assets.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index fell as much as
0.9 percent before paring its losses to 0.3 percent at 20,729.42
by the end of trading in Lagos.  Nigeria ’s benchmark measure gained 19 percent in 2010,
making it the best performer in sub-Saharan Africa after Kenya’s
gauge, which rallied 34 percent. Since then, there have been
several bombing attacks in the country, including one on
Christmas Day that killed at least 43 people near the capital,
Abuja.  Increasing security issues in Nigeria, delays in the
conclusion of banking reforms begun in 2009 and the prolonged
sovereign-debt crises in  Europe  whittled investors’ appetite for
the country’s assets, leading to the decline this year, Abiola
Razaq, an analyst with Lagos-based Vetiva, said by phone today.  The decline “is contrary to our expectations for the
year,” he said. Vetiva expected a passage of the Petroleum
Industry Bill, which seeks to reform the country’s oil and gas
industry and attract foreign investment into the nation, but
this is yet to happen, he said.  Vetiva expects “a positive 2012,” driven by low
valuations, Razaq said. The  Bloomberg Banking Index (NGSEB10) , which
tracks the performance of the 10 most capitalized banks, fell 32
percent this year. “Foreign investors will appreciate that the
risks in emerging markets are not as bad as is being thought,”
he said. In 2012, there will be a repricing of risks in  emerging
markets , including Nigeria, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
