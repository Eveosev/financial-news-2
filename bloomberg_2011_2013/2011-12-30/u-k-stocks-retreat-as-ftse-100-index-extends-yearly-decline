U.K. stocks (SXXP)  were little changed,
with the benchmark FTSE 100 Index posting a 5.6 percent drop
this year, amid concern the euro-area debt crisis will hamper
equity-market gains into 2012.  Man Group Plc and  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  declined 1.9 percent and
1.7 percent, respectively, for the biggest losses on the
benchmark gauge. J Sainsbury Plc climbed 2.3 percent.  The FTSE 100 advanced 5.51, or 0.1 percent, to 5,572.28 at
the close in  London . The FTSE-All Share Index added 0.2 percent,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 2 percent.  “ Europe  is going to face a deep recession in the first
half of next year,” said  Gerard Lyons , the chief economist at
Standard Chartered Plc in London. “It’s in terrible shape.
Fundamentals are not good, policy stance is terrible and
confidence has been shot to pieces.” He spoke in a Bloomberg
Television interview with Linda Yueh.  Volumes on the FTSE 100 this week were more than 50 percent
below this year’s average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Trading in London will close early today for the New
Year’s holiday.  Banks, along with metals and mining companies, accounted
for the biggest annual declines among Britain’s biggest 350
companies amid concern that the fiscal crisis is spreading to
the region’s larger economies. The FTSE 350 Banks and the FTSE
350 Mining Index slumped about 30 percent.  Alternative-energy (F3ALNRG) 
and  tobacco companies  posted the largest gains as investors
sought stocks with profits less tied to economic growth.  The 5.6 percent decline in the FTSE 100 this year compares
with an 18 percent tumble in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index and for the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S.
shares rose 0.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
