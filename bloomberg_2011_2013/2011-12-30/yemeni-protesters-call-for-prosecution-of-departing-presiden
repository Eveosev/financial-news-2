Tens of thousands of people
protested today across Yemen, demanding the prosecution of
outgoing President Ali Abdullah Saleh in a challenge to a Saudi-
brokered plan to resolve months of unrest.  Thousands of protesters in Sana’a shouted “you will not
escape punishment” and demanded that Saleh and his relatives be
tried for the killings of more than 1,140 people since the
uprising in January.  Saleh agreed last month to surrender power in return for
immunity. Neighboring  Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf Cooperation
Council states, with backing from the U.S., mediated the
agreement. Saleh said Dec. 24 he plans to leave soon for the
U.S. as the Arab country prepares for a Feb. 21 election to
replace him.  Thousands of Saleh supporters protested elsewhere in Sana’a
in a counter-demonstration calling for commitment to the
transition agreement. State-owned television stations didn’t
broadcast a pro-Saleh demonstration for the first time since
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
