Friendly Ice Cream Corp. (FRND) , the 76-
year-old restaurant chain, won court approval to sell the
business, allowing it to be retained by its current owner,
private-equity firm Sun Capital Partners Inc.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross approved the sale at a
hearing today in Wilmington,  Delaware , according to court
documents. Friendly canceled its proposed Dec. 22 bankruptcy
auction after it didn’t receive any qualified bids to compete
with Sun Capital.  Sun Capital, based in  Boca Raton , Florida, will pay about
$75 million and retain ownership through a unit while allowing
the Friendly’s chain to shed debt.  Friendly, which opened in 1935 with one shop in
Springfield, Massachusetts, sought bankruptcy protection in
October citing the struggling economy and rising commodity
costs. Debt was listed at about $297 million and assets were
valued at more than $100 million, according to court documents.  The Wilbraham, Massachusetts-based company, known as
“Friendly’s,” closed 63 sites as part of the bankruptcy
filing. Another 424 locations will stay open, Friendly said.  The case is In re Friendly Ice Cream Corp., 11-13167,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
