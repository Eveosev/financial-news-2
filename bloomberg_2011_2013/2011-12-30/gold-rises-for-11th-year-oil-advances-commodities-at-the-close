The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge (SPGSCI)  of
24 commodities fell to close at 644.91 at 3:50 p.m.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index (CMCIPI)  of 26 raw materials rose to
1,520.804 at 4:11 p.m.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rose the most this month, capping an 11th straight
annual advance, on speculation that demand will climb from
jewelers and investors.  Gold fell 4.7 percent in the previous six sessions to the
lowest level since July 7 as the dollar gained against the euro,
curbing demand for the metal as an alternative investment. That
may boost seasonal purchases, said Marc Ground, a commodities
strategist at Standard Bank Plc. In the first quarter of 2011,
jewelry demand jumped 12 percent from a year earlier in  India ,
the world’s biggest buyer, according to World Gold Council data.  Gold futures for February delivery climbed 1.7 percent to
settle at $1,566.80 an ounce at 1:35 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , ending the longest slump since March 2009.  Silver futures for March delivery jumped 2.2 percent to
$27.915 an ounce on the Comex, paring its decline for 2011 to
9.8 percent, the first annual drop since 2008.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, palladium futures for
March delivery climbed 5.2 percent to $656.15 an ounce, rising
the most since Oct. 21. The metal dropped 18 percent in 2011.
Platinum futures for April delivery advanced 2.8 percent to
$1,404.90 an ounce and declined 21 percent this year.  BASE METALS  Copper rose the most in two weeks, paring the first annual
decline since 2008, on bets that U.S. growth will buoy metals
demand as the economy slows in  China .  The U.S. expanded at a rate of 1.8 percent this year and
will probably increase 2.1 percent in 2012, according to the
median of 70 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. A
private report yesterday showed more Americans than forecast
signed contracts to buy previously owned homes in November. The
average house uses about 400 pounds (181 kilograms) of copper in
the U.S., the world’s second-biggest consumer.  Copper futures for March delivery climbed 2 percent to
close at $3.436 a pound at 1:18 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Dec. 16. The
rally capped a quarterly increase of 9 percent, the first in a
year.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 2.4 percent to $7,600 a metric ton ($3.45 a pound).
Tin, aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc also gained in London.  The  LME Index (LMEX)  of the six main metals traded on the U.K.
exchange has tumbled 22 percent in 2011 after more than doubling
in the previous two years. Tin led declines, dropping 29
percent. Aluminum had the smallest loss, falling 18 percent.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil pared a third annual increase as Chinese
manufacturing contracted for a second month in December,
spurring concern that demand from the world’s second-largest
crude-consuming country may slow.  Futures dropped 0.8 percent after the report by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics also showed China’s exports
fell for the first time in three months as Europe’s debt crisis
reduced orders. Oil advanced 8.2 percent in 2011 as a collapse
in Libyan exports cut supply, U.S. stimulus measures revived the
economy and  Iran  threatened to close the  Strait of Hormuz .  Crude for February delivery slid 82 cents to settle at
$98.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices
slipped 1.5 percent this month and 0.9 percent this week. Oil
surged 25 percent in the three months ended today, the biggest
quarterly gain since June 2009.  Brent oil for February settlement dropped 63 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $107.38 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  Exchange, up 13 percent this year.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil rose, widening its third consecutive yearly
gain, on speculation demand for U.S. diesel exports will
increase after three refineries in Europe began shutting down.  Futures rose as Petroplus Holdings AG, Europe’s largest
independent refiner by capacity, said it will suspend operations
at three plants in the region after banks froze $1 billion of
the company’s loans, cutting crude supplies. The sites have a
combined processing capacity of 337,300 barrels of crude a day,
and the closures may reduce European supplies of diesel.  January-delivery heating oil rose 1.75 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.935 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices rose 15 percent in 2011, after gaining 20
percent in 2010.  Gasoline futures for January rose 0.62 cent to $2.6863 a
gallon. Prices gained 9.5 percent this year, after rising 20
percent last year and doubling in 2009. Gasoline is down 22
percent from the 2011 peak of $3.4648 on April 29.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures fell below $3 for the first time in
more than two years as mild weather and record production
contribute to a growing stockpile surplus.  Gas capped a 32 percent annual drop, the biggest decline
since 2006, as forecasts for above-normal temperatures in
January spurred speculation that inventories of the heating fuel
will stay above average levels during the winter months, when
demand is strongest.  Natural gas for February delivery fell 3.8 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.989 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since Sept. 11,
2009. The futures fell for the fourth straight year.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn rose, capping a third straight annual gain, and
soybeans climbed on concern that bad weather will cause
irreversible damage to  Argentina ’s crops.  Argentina will be dry during the next 10 days with
temperatures averaging above-normal, increasing stress on
reproducing corn, Global Weather Monitoring said in a report
today. At least 19 percent of the crops have yet to be planted,
the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said yesterday. Reduced South
American output may boost demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s top producer.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 1.3 percent to close
at $6.465 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
The price touched $6.485, the highest level since Nov. 17.  Soybean futures for March delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
$12.0775 a bushel on the CBOT, the first gain in three sessions.
The oilseed slumped 14 percent in 2011, the first annual decline
since 2008.  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 1.2 percent to settle
at $6.5275 a bushel on the CBOT. The price is up 13 percent
since mid-December. Futures fell 18 percent this year, capping
the biggest annual slump since 2008, on increasing world output.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee rose, paring its first annual drop since 2008, on
signs that supplies remain tight. Sugar fell while cocoa rose.  In the season started Oct. 1, global coffee output will
fall 3.4 percent from a year earlier to 128.6 million bags as
bad weather hurts crops in Central America and  Colombia , the
 International Coffee Organization  said Dec. 13. Demand has
climbed 2.5 percent annually in the past decade, according to
the ICO. A bag weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  Arabica coffee futures for March delivery climbed 1.2
percent to settle at $2.2685 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. The commodity retreated 5.7 percent in 2011,
after advancing 77 percent last year and 21 percent in 2009.  Raw sugar for March delivery dropped 0.9 percent to close
at 23.3 cents a pound on ICE. This year, the sweetener tumbled
27 percent, the first annual decline since 2007, as expanding
production in  Asia  and Europe more than offset a drop in output
in  Brazil , the world’s leading cane grower.  Cocoa for March delivery gained 1.2 percent to $2,109 a
metric ton in New York, halting a five-session slump. The
commodity plunged 31 percent this year, the biggest annual loss
since 1999. Output is rising in western  Africa , the largest
producing region, amid concern that the European debt crisis
will curb demand for the chocolate ingredient.  In  London  futures trading, robusta coffee advanced, refined
sugar declined and cocoa rose on NYSE Liffe.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures fell, capping the longest slump since
October, on speculation that demand for beef may slow after U.S.
prices climbed to the highest in a month. Hogs gained.  Wholesale choice beef fell (BOXBBC9V)  at midday for the first time in
three days, after rallying 19 percent in a year and yesterday
reaching $1.9468 a pound, the highest level since Nov. 29, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Export sales of beef fell
6.7 percent to 13,693 metric tons in the week ended Dec. 22,
from a week earlier, the government said today.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.7 percent to
settle at $1.2145 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after dropping to $1.214, the lowest level since Dec.
22. Prices slipped for a fourth day, the longest slump since
Oct. 31. The commodity was up 12 percent this year, the third
straight advance, on the outlook for decreasing production.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement dropped 0.7
percent to $1.488 a pound on the CME. The price reached a record
$1.508 on Dec. 28. Futures rallied 20 percent in 2011.  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.4 percent to
close at 84.3 cents a pound in Chicago, capping a 5.7 percent
gain for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
