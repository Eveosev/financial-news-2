Jets running back LaDainian Tomlinson said the team’s Jan. 1 regular-season finale against
the  Miami Dolphins  may be his last game if  New York  doesn’t make
the National Football League playoffs.  “There is definitely a thought that this could be, because
you never know how things shake out,” he told reporters
yesterday. “I would love to keep playing, but if the situation
is not right, then I won’t. This possibly could be my last
game.”  The Jets need a win against the Dolphins and losses by
three other teams to claim the American Football Conference’s
final wild-card berth and reach the playoffs.  Tomlinson, 32, needs 35 yards rushing to pass Jerome Bettis
for fifth place on the NFL’s career list. He has 224 yards
rushing this season and 13,628 overall.  “If this is my last game, I’ve enjoyed 11 years of playing
football, playing a kid’s game (with) two great organizations,”
Tomlinson said. “There is nothing I could complain about.”  Tomlinson, a five-time Pro Bowl selection, had nine seasons
with the  San Diego Chargers  before he signed a two-year contract
with the Jets in 2010.  He set an NFL record for single-season touchdowns with 31
and single-season rushing touchdowns with 28 in 2006. He also
holds the record for most points scored in a single season with
186, also in 2006.  Tomlinson has scored three touchdowns this season with the
Jets, pushing his career total to 162 and joining Emmitt Smith
and Jerry Rice as the only players with 160 or more touchdowns.
He is second behind Smith in rushing touchdowns with 145.  He is fifth in career yards from scrimmage with 18,377 and,
with 620 catches, is one of four running backs to have 600 or
more career receptions -- joining Larry Centers,  Marshall Faulk 
and Keith Byars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
