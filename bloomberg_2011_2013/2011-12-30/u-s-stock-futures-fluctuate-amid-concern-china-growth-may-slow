U.S. stock-index futures advanced,
with the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index poised to close
2011 with a gain, as German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
ruled out a euro-area breakup.  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the world’s largest home-improvement
retailer, rose 0.5 percent in German trading.  Hecla Mining Co. (HL) 
jumped 1.3 percent as precious metals advanced.  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring in March added 0.2 percent
to 1,259.8 at 12:38 p.m. in  London . The benchmark equity gauge
is heading for a 0.4 percent gain this year, its third straight
year of advances. Dow Jones futures gained 12 points, or 0.1
percent, to 12,229 today.  “Volumes are low and shares won’t move much today,” said
Didier Abbato, a vice president and senior trading adviser at
Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. “So the S&P 500 will finish in
positive territory.”  Schaeuble ruled out a euro-area breakup and said the region
is doing everything to maintain confidence in the euro,
according to an interview with  Germany ’s Handelsblatt.  The S&P 500  rose 1.1 percent yesterday as data signaled the
world’s largest economy is weathering the euro-area debt crisis.
The measure has rallied 12 percent in the fourth quarter as
investors turned attention from the crisis to better-than-
estimated U.S. economic data.  The Year Gone By  Financial shares have  fallen the most  among the 10 main
industries in the S&P 500 this year, losing 18 percent as a
group, followed by losses of 12 percent in raw-material
producers. Utilities, consumer-staples providers and health-care
companies, among stocks considered the least sensitive to
economic prospects, rose at least 10 percent for the top gains.  The S&P 500 started the year with a rally, rising as much
as 8.4 percent to a three-year high by the end of April and
extending its rebound from a March 2009 bear-market low to 102
percent.  The index tumbled throughout the summer as Congress and
President  Barack Obama  struggled over U.S. deficit cuts, and
sank further amid concern that the euro-area’s debt crisis was
threatening the global economic recovery. The S&P 500 fell as
much as 19 percent from April to its low for the year on Oct. 3.  Data signaling that the world’s largest economy was
weathering  Europe ’s crisis helped the market rebound. The U.S.
unemployment rate fell to 8.6 percent in November, the lowest
since March 2009, after lingering at 9 percent or above for
seven straight months.  ‘Downside Pressure’  China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported the world’s
second-largest economy may face “downside pressure” next year,
even though growth will be more than 9 percent in 2011.  Home Depot rose 0.5 percent to $42.23 in German trading.
 Fitch Ratings  downgraded Sears Holding Corp.’s long-term default
ratings to CCC from B after the retailer this week said it will
close as many as 120 stores.  Hecla, the precious metals miner, advanced 1.3 percent to
$5.30 in early trading in  New York , tracking an advance in
silver and gold on the London Metals Exchange.  Yamana Gold Inc (YRI) 
advanced 1.5 percent to $14.84 and  Barrick Gold Corp (ABX)  rose 1.4
percent to $45.82.  Boeing Co. (BA) , the Chicago-based planemaker, fell 0.4 percent
in  Frankfurt  to $73.82. Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney
told the Australian newspaper the global aviation industry is
undergoing a restructuring that will lead to increasingly larger
combinations of carriers sharing the market with smaller niche
players.  To contact the reporter on this story:
