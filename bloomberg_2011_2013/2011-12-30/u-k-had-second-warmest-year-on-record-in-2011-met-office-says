This year is poised to be the second
warmest on record for the U.K., the  Met Office  said.  The average temperature nationwide through Dec. 28 has been
9.62 degrees Celsius (49.3 degrees Fahrenheit), second only to
9.73 degrees in 2006, the Met Office, the government forecaster,
said in an e-mailed  statement . Last year at 7.97 degrees was the
12th coldest in a series that began in 1910.  “This year marks a return to a trend of warmer than
average annual temperatures,” the Met Office said today. “All
the U.K.’s top seven warmest years happened in the last
decade.”  Before 2011, the second warmest year in the nationwide
temperature series was 2007, with an average of 9.59 degrees.
Countrywide data started in 1910, while temperature data for
central  England  dates to 1659.  U.K. records set in 2011 include the warmest logged April
and spring, and the hottest recorded October temperature at 29.9
degrees in Gravesend, southeast England on Oct. 1. Gravesend
also had the country’s highest recorded temperature of the year
at 33.1 degrees on June 27.  Scotland  posted its wettest year in the data series, with
1,859.5 millimeters (73.2 inches) beating the previous record
from 1990.  To contact the reporter on this story:
