Heating oil rose, heading for its
third consecutive yearly gain on speculation demand for U.S.
diesel exports will increase after three refineries in  Europe 
began shutting down.  Futures advanced after  Petroplus Holdings AG (PPHN) , Europe’s
largest independent refiner by capacity, began shutting plants
in the region after banks froze $1 billion of its loans, cutting
oil supplies.  “The story on Petroplus is the perfect example of why
Europe matters when it comes to  oil prices ,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “These guys
can’t get credit and they’re shutting down refineries.”  January-delivery heating oil rose 1.18 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.9293 a gallon at 10:22 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 15 percent in 2011, the third
consecutive yearly gain.  The more actively traded February contract gained 0.3
percent to $2.9285.  January gasoline and heating oil contracts will expire at
the close of floor trading today.  The 3-2-1  crack spread (ACK321A) , a measure of profit from turning
three barrels of Brent crude into two barrels of gasoline and
one of heating oil, based on February contracts, increased 29
cents to $7.91 a barrel. That’s the highest level since Oct. 7.  “I’m expecting in the near term to see support for the
cracks on the back of the Petroplus shutdowns,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  The U.S. exported a record 1.07 million barrels a day of
heating oil and  diesel fuel  in October, the Energy Department
reported yesterday. About 18 percent, or 196,000 barrels a day,
went to the Netherlands, the top destination for U.S. diesel and
heating oil cargoes, Energy Department data show.  Gasoline for January delivery fell 0.11 cent to $2.679 a
gallon on the exchange. Prices are up 9.2 percent this year,
after rising 20 percent last year and doubling in 2009.  The February contract sank 0.5 percent to $2.657 a gallon
on the exchange.  Regular gasoline (3AGSREG)  at the pump, averaged nationwide, climbed
1.5 cents to $3.269 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.
Prices were 6.4 percent above a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
