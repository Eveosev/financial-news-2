BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4)  plan to expand production at their Guara oilfield off Brazil
in 2013 after declaring the deposit commercially viable.  The partners, together with  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  and China
Petrochemical Corp., will start the field production phase after
their development plan receives approval from the Brazilian
authorities, BG said today in a statement. The companies have
proposed renaming the field as Sapinhoa.  The deposit is “comprising excellent reservoirs with good
quality” light oil, BG said. The partners drilled four wells to
appraise the field and produced about 2.8 million barrels of oil
equivalent during tests, according to BG’s October  presentation .  Petrobras, which filed a declaration at the National
Petroleum Agency of  Brazil  on the field’s viability, yesterday
 said  the Guara area holds an estimated 2.1 billion barrels of
recoverable crude reserves. The partners plan to deploy at least
two floating production, storage and offloading vessels, or
FPSOs, to develop the field, according to BG.  Each FPSO will have the capacity to pump 150,000 barrels of
crude and 8 million cubic meters (283 million cubic feet) of
natural gas a day, according to Petrobras. The partners expect
to recover about 750 million barrels of oil equivalent per unit,
according to BG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
