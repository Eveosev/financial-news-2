President  Viktor Yanukovych  canceled
the state’s official commemoration of the Orange Revolution on
Nov. 22 to mark the day in 2004 when mass protests broke out in
central Kiev and led to the overturning of Yanukovych’s victory
in a disputed presidential vote.  Yanukovych, who won presidential elections in 2010 over
Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko , signed the decree today, his
office said in a statement.  Tymoshenko helped lead the Orange Revolution which brought
Viktor Yushchenko to victory over Yanukovych in the repeated
presidential elections in 2004.  To contact the reporters on this story:
