Copper rose the most in two weeks,
paring the first annual decline since 2008, on bets that U.S.
growth will buoy metals demand as the economy slows in  China .  The U.S. expanded at a rate of 1.8 percent this year and
will probably increase 2.1 percent in 2012, according to the
median of 70 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. A
private report yesterday showed more Americans than forecast
signed contracts to buy previously owned homes in November. The
average house uses about 400 pounds (181 kilograms) of copper in
the U.S., the world’s second-biggest consumer.  If the strength of the housing market is “real and just
not another head-fake, we could have a potential game-changer on
our hands for the  U.S. economy  going into 2012,”  Edward Meir ,
an analyst at INTL FCStone Inc. in New York, said in a report.  Copper futures for March delivery climbed 2 percent to
close at $3.436 a pound at 1:18 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Dec. 16. The
rally capped a quarterly increase of 9 percent since, the first
in a year.  Prices still tumbled 23 percent this year as  Europe ’s
fiscal woes threatened global growth and demand waned in China,
the top metals buyer. After reaching a record $4.6575 in
February, copper slumped to a 14-month low of $2.994 on Oct. 3.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said today a
purchasing managers’ index for China was at 48.7 in December.
Readings below 50 signal contraction. The euro is headed for its
first back-to-back annual decreases versus the dollar in a
decade as the region’s debt crisis worsened.  ‘Euro-Zone Situation’  “The euro-zone situation will probably deteriorate and
continue to weigh on things,”  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at
Kingsview Financial in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 2.4 percent to $7,600 a metric ton ($3.45 a pound).
Tin, aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc also gained in London.  The  LME Index (LMEX)  of the six main metals traded on the U.K.
exchange has tumbled 22 percent in 2011 after more than doubling
in the previous two years. Tin led declines, dropping 29
percent. Aluminum had the smallest loss, falling 18 percent.  Comex floor trading will be closed on Jan. 2 in observance
of the New Year’s holiday. The LME also will be shut.  To contact the reporters on this story:
