Australia included fast bowler  Ryan
Harris  in a 12-man squad for the second cricket Test against
India starting Jan. 3 in Sydney.  Paceman Mitchell Starc and all-rounder Daniel Christian
drop out of the squad on duty for the series opener, which
Australia won by 122 runs yesterday to go 1-0 up in the best-of-
four series. Harris, who has taken 35 wickets in eight Tests,
missed Australia’s past four matches because of a hip injury.  “Ryan has had carefully monitored preparation, which has
gone to plan,” head selector John Inverarity said in a
statement. “We’ll go into the game with confidence and
momentum.”  All-rounder Shane Watson wasn’t considered for selection as
he continues his recovery from a calf injury.  AUSTRALIA:  Michael Clarke  (captain), Brad Haddin, Ed Cowan,
Ryan Harris, Ben Hilfenhaus, Mike Hussey, Nathan Lyon, Shaun
Marsh, James Pattinson,  Ricky Ponting , Peter Siddle, David
Warner.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
