Egypt ’s long-term foreign currency
debt was downgraded by  Fitch Ratings , which pointed to a decline
in central bank reserves and uncertainty over possible
International Monetary Fund support.  Fitch lowered the rating to BB-from BB with a negative
outlook. The long-term local currency rating was cut to BB from
BB+, it said in an e-mailed report today.  Egyptian central bank reserves fell 44 percent in 2011 as
the central bank sought to keep the local currency stable with
investment and tourism falling. Reserves fell to about $20
billion in November, from $36 billion at the end of 2010, Fitch
said today.  Policy makers in the north African country are trying to
manage unrest even as borrowing costs rise after the popular
revolt that ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  in February.  “Although reserves remain above three months of current
external payments, the pace of decline is a concern,” Fitch
analyst Richard Fox wrote in the report. Alternative sources of
funding such as an IMF program have “been promised but await
definitive decisions by the government.”  Egyptian public finances have also weakened, Fitch said.
Government debt is likely to rise to 80 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012 and this year’s budget deficit will
exceed the goal of 8.6 percent of GDP, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
