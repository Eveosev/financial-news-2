Diesel in New York Harbor widened
yearly gains after three European refineries began closing,
indicating greater demand for U.S. exports.  The fuel strengthened as  Petroplus Holdings AG (PPHN) ,  Europe ’s
largest independent refiner by capacity, will suspend operations
at three plants in the region after banks froze $1 billion of
the company’s loans. The sites have a combined processing
capacity of 337,300 barrels of crude a day, and the closures may
reduce European supplies of diesel.  The U.S. exported a record 1.07 million barrels a day of
heating oil and  diesel fuel  in October, the Energy Department
reported yesterday. About 18 percent, or 196,000 barrels a day,
went to the Netherlands, the top destination for U.S. diesel and
heating oil cargoes, Energy Department data show.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  New York Harbor (DIESNULP)  gained 0.63 cent
to a 3.88-cent premium to heating oil futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the first gain in three days. The gap at
the end of 2010 was 0.55 cent.  Prompt delivery diesel in the Harbor rose 2.38 cents to
$2.9738 a gallon. The price advanced 17 percent this year.  Chicago ultra-low-sulfur diesel’s (CHCGUTLS)  discount to futures was
unchanged at 25 cents a gallon, the biggest gap since at least
July 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread
has widened 16.87 cents this year.  Prompt delivery for the fuel in  Chicago , which rose 8.6
percent this year, fell 0.59 cent to $2.6642 today.  Midcontinent Weaker  The same fuel in the  Midcontinent (GRP3UTLS) , or Group 3 market,
weakened 0.63 cent to a 6.88-cent discount, 4.38 cents wider
than a year earlier. The immediate-delivery price increased 1.13
cents to $2.8663 a gallon, and was up 14 percent this year.  In the  Gulf Coast (DIESGULP) , diesel weakened 0.96 cent to an 0.08-
cent discount from a premium yesterday, compared with a 3.7-cent
discount at end-2010. Prompt delivery of the fuel fell 0.58 cent
to $2.9231 a gallon today, and was up 17 percent this year.  January-delivery heating oil rose 1.75 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.935 a gallon on the Nymex, while the
February contract slipped 0.59 cent to $2.9142. Futures rose 15
percent this year, after gaining 20 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
