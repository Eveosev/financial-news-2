Japanese  stocks (TPX)  rose on 2011’s last
day of trading, lifted by signs of U.S. economic recovery, with
the  Topix (TPX)  Index posting its steepest annual decline since 2008
in a year marred by natural disasters, nuclear meltdowns and a
crisis in Europe.  Japan ’s record earthquake and tsunami on March 11 largely
decided the year’s biggest winners and losers.  Tokyo Electric
Power Co. (9501) , owner of the Fukushima power plant wrecked in the
disaster, dropped 91 percent.  SxL Corp. (1919) , a builder that has
benefited from reconstruction work, surged 262 percent.  The  Topix (TPX)  plunged 16 percent in the two trading days
following the disaster, which left almost 20,000 people dead or
missing and disrupted factory production at companies from
Toyota Motor Corp. to Sony Corp. The market plummeted 16 percent
in the two days after the quake, its biggest drop since the week
of Black Monday in October 1987.  “Japan’s markets suffered from multiple negative factors
that other countries didn’t face, such as the earthquake and the
yen’s strength,” said Takashi Aoki, who helps manage 120
billion yen at Tokyo-based Mizuho Asset Management Co. “Next
year, the markets are likely to rebound.”  Topix Drops  For the year, Japan’s broadest benchmark of equities fell
19 percent, eclipsing a 12 percent decline on the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, ground zero for the debt crisis.  The Topix added 0.9 percent to 728.61 today. The  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  rose for the first time in four days, climbing 0.7
percent to 8,455.35. Trading volume was about half the 100-day
average ahead of a four-day weekend, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.1 percent
today. The gauge advanced 1.1 percent yesterday in  New York  as
the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits dropped to
the lowest since June 2008. Stocks also advanced as pending
sales of existing homes jumped 7.3 percent in November, beating
economists’ estimates by almost five times.  “Investors increasingly feel the  U.S. economy  is firmer
than they had expected,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market
analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “The economic data is looking
good and that will boost stock markets, especially when concern
about  Europe ’s debt issues aren’t in the forefront.”  2012 Market Projection  Japanese stocks may rise next year for the first time since
2009, with analysts projecting a 20 percent gain on the  Topix
Index (TPX) , as the lowest valuations in almost three years lure
investors.  The Topix may reach 873 by the end of 2012 after closing
this year at 728.61, according to the median estimate of 21
strategists and investors surveyed by Bloomberg News. The gain
would be the biggest since 2005 on the Topix, the worst-
performing major benchmark since the depths of the financial
crisis in March 2009.  Analysts at banks from Morgan Stanley to Credit Suisse
Group AG a year ago predicted Japan’s broadest equities index
would gain more than 10 percent in 2011. Instead, the March
earthquake and ensuing nuclear crisis, floods in  Thailand  and a
surge in the yen sent the gauge plunging.  The following are among the most active shares in the
Japanese  market (NKY)  today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  Chiyoda Corp. (6366)  (6366 JT), an engineering company, gained 2.1
percent to 783 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported operating
profit will likely beat its outlook by as much as 3 billion yen
($39 million) in the fiscal year ending March due to less-than-
expected costs for a liquefied natural gas project in Qatar.  Himaraya Co. (7514)  (7514 JT), a sporting-goods retailer, slumped
6.4 percent to 524 yen, the biggest drop since June 30, after
saying it had a net loss of 267 million yen in the nine months
ended Nov. 30, citing lower sales of golf gear.  Start Today Co. (3092 JT), an operator of websites that
sell clothing, jumped 5.3 percent to 1,801 yen. Bank of America
Merrill Lynch initiated coverage on the company with a “buy”
rating.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto and Satoshi Kawano in
