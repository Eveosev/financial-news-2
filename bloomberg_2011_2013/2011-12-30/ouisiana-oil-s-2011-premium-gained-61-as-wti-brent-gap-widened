The premium for Light Louisiana
Sweet oil in the U.S. Gulf Coast gained  61 (USCSLLSS)  percent this year
above West Texas Intermediate as the gap between the U.S.
benchmark and Brent more than doubled.  The  spread (CLCO1)  between the two benchmark crude widened 19 cents
to settle at $8.55 a barrel today.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI gained 15 cents to

barrel.  The discount for  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS)  narrowed 19 percent
this year and was unchanged today at $16.15 a barrel at 2:07

a discount of $3 at the end of 2010. The grade was unchanged at
$3.05 a barrel today. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic
