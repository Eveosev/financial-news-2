Latvia ’s  Finance Ministry  and
central bank nominated Kristaps Zakulis as head of the country’s
bank regulator, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  Zakulis was head of security for state-owned
telecommunications company SIA Lattelecom, according to the
statement. Zakulis’s nomination needs parliamentary approval.  Irena Krumane, the former director of the regulator,
resigned on Nov. 28 following the suspension of Latvijas
Krajbanka AS, the country’s sixth-biggest deposit bank and
accusations of missing money at the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
