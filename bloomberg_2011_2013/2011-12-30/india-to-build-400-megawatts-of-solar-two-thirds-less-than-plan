India  will complete 400 megawatts of
solar power connected to the grid this fiscal year, two-thirds
less than previously forecast by state and central governments.  India has so far built 180 megawatts during the year ending
March 31, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Gujarat had planned to build more than 900 megawatts during
the fiscal year as part of a regional solar program, according
to documents obtained from the state government. In addition,
the central government’s Solar Mission had a forecast of 302
megawatts, according to a list of plans from the ministry.  The mission involved 150 megawatts of operations awarded by
auction, 98 megawatts of rooftop developments and 54 megawatts
of capacity under a program to consolidate state-level projects.  India’s  renewable energy  capacity has grown 20 percent in
2011 to 22,447 megawatts, according to the statement. Wind farms
made up most of the increase, adding a total of 2,827 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
