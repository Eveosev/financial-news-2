Workers at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper &
Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Indonesian unit will gradually return to the
Grasberg mine in Papua starting next week and are expected to
resume full work by Jan. 20, Virgo Solossa, head of
organizational affairs at the labor union that represents the
employees, said by telephone from Timika today.  More than 8,000 workers went on strike Sept. 15, demanding
higher wages. PT Freeport  Indonesia  and the union agreed this
month to a 37 percent pay rise over two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
