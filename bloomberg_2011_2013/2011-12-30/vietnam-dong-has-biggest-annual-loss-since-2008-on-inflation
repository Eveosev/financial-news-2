Vietnam ’s dong had its biggest
yearly decline since 2008 and bond yields surged as policy
makers confront the fastest inflation rate in Asia.  Consumer prices rose 18.1 percent in December from a year
earlier after increasing 19.8 percent in November, official data
showed last week. Vietnam can reduce inflation to below 10
percent in 2012 so long as money-supply growth doesn’t exceed 16
percent, Do Thuc, general director of the General Statistics
Office, said yesterday.  “The government is still determined to reduce the
inflation rate in 2012,” said Nguyen Hong Quang, a Hanoi-based
fixed-income dealer at the Bank for Agriculture & Rural
Development, the country’s biggest lender.  The dong slid 7.4 percent this year, the worst performance
among  Asia ’s most-traded currencies after  India ’s rupee. The
currency weakened 0.1 percent today to 21,049 per dollar as of 4
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the  reference rate (SBVNUSD)  at 20,828,
unchanged for a fourth day, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  Policy makers devalued the dong on Feb. 11 by about 7
percent, the most since at least 1993, to help curb the nation’s
trade deficit and narrow the gap between the official and black-
market rates.  The  yield (GGVN3YR)  on three-year  government bonds  surged 1.5
percentage points in 2011. It fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 12.48 percent today, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
