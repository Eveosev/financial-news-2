The weakest growth in demand in at
least a decade for shipments of  iron ore , the second-biggest
commodity cargo after crude oil, means rates for the largest
vessels will plunge to the lowest level since 2002.  Capesizes, each hauling about 160,000 metric tons of ore,
will earn an average of $15,000 a day next year, about 4 percent
less than in 2011, the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
10 analysts shows. While that implies losses for ship owners and
investors in their companies, speculators can profit because
forward freight agreements, handled by brokers and used to bet
on transport costs, are anticipating an average of $16,367,
according to data from the London-based Baltic Exchange.  Owners are contending with the biggest fleet in history as
vessels ordered when rates reached $233,988 in 2008 continue to
leave ship yards. The glut may widen because trade in iron ore
will expand 2.5 percent next year as the number of capesizes
rises 9.8 percent, according to Clarkson Plc, the world’s
biggest shipbroker. Economic growth in  China , whose steel mills
consume 65 percent of all seaborne ore, will slow to the weakest
since 2001, economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The question for ship owners now is how are you going to
hang on, how long are you going to hang on, and when is the
light at the end of the tunnel?” said Andreas Vergottis, the
Hong Kong-based research director at Tufton Oceanic Ltd., whose
$1.45 billion shipping hedge fund is the world’s largest.
“There is definitely no light in the 2012 tunnel.”  Freight Costs  Rates (BCAVRT)  for capesizes averaged $15,639 this year, down from
$33,298 in 2010, according to the exchange, which publishes
freight costs for more than 50 maritime routes. The 1,000-foot-
long ships need about $20,000 a day to break even, Oslo-based
Arctic Securities ASA estimates.  The combined earnings of the 14-company Bloomberg Pure Play
Dry Bulk Shipping  Index (BPG4DBS)  will drop 82 percent this year, analyst
predictions compiled by Bloomberg show. Eight of the companies
will report even lower profit or losses for 2012.  Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd. (9107) , based in Tokyo and the top capesize operator, will
lose money this fiscal year and next.  Chinese growth will drop to 8.5 percent next year, compared
with 9.2 percent in 2011, the median of 14 economist estimates
compiled by Bloomberg shows. Steel production in the country,
which accounts for about 44 percent of the world total, fell in
each of the six months through November, according to the
Brussels-based World Steel Association. China will import 5.8
percent more iron ore next year, against 10 percent in 2011,
Clarkson estimates.  Container Shipping  A rally in capesize rates that began in August and lifted
charter costs to $32,889 on Dec. 12 is already fading, declining
16 percent to $27,512 since then, according to the exchange.
FFAs anticipate a further drop to $15,096 in the first quarter,
bourse data show. The market for the contracts, which also
covers oil tankers and container shipping, was valued at $24
billion in 2010, according to the exchange.  Rates may rebound should Chinese growth exceed economists’
expectations. Clarkson, based in  London , raised its estimate for
2011 Chinese iron-ore imports three times this year, increasing
the forecast by 4.8 percentage points overall. The nation’s
economy expanded 10.4 percent in 2010, more than the 9.5 percent
anticipated by economists surveyed by Bloomberg in January.  Slumping rates and values for  secondhand (BESPCAPE)  ships may also
spur owners to scrap older vessels. The difference between the
price of a 20-year-old capesize and its demolition value
declined 47 percent to $3.1 million this year, Clarkson data
show. Eleven percent of the fleet is at least 20 years old.  Biggest Cost  Owners may also seek to boost earnings by slowing ships
down to burn less fuel, their biggest cost. Capesize speeds
averaged 9.6 knots this year, compared with almost 10.7 knots in
2010, ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. Speed cuts
mean vessels take longer to complete voyages and seek new
business, effectively reducing the fleet’s capacity.  The  number (VESLCPIS)  of capesizes has risen 58 percent to 1,186 since
the end of 2007 and outstanding orders at yards equate to 27
percent of existing capacity, according to data from Redhill,
England-based IHS Fairplay.  There are also gluts beyond so-called dry-bulk commodity
shipping. Returns from hauling Saudi Arabian crude to  Japan , the
industry’s benchmark route, fell 53 percent to $12,445 a day
this year, according to the exchange. That’s less than the
$30,200 that Hamilton, Bermuda-based  Frontline Ltd. (FRO) , the biggest
operator of supertankers, says it needs to break even.  Trading Route  An  index (CTEXIDEX)  reflecting charges for six types of containers
slid 43 percent since the start of April, according to the
Hamburg Shipbrokers’ Association. Volumes of steel boxes
carrying everything from televisions to furniture to the U.S.
from  Asia , the biggest inter-regional trading route, dropped for
the first time in almost two years in the third quarter,
according to  Newark , New Jersey-based PIERS, which operates a
database of U.S. waterborne trade activity.  It’s not just capesize owners suffering within dry-bulk
shipping.  Panamaxes (BPRATCR) , which carry about half as much cargo, will
earn $13,250 a day in 2012, compared with an average of $14,000
this year, the Bloomberg survey of analysts shows.  The Bloomberg Dry Bulk Pure Play Index, which also includes
shipping companies that operate panamaxes, plunged 45 percent
this year, compared with a 10 percent decline by the MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities. Treasuries returned 9.7
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Kawasaki Kisen, which has 82 capesizes, will report a net
loss of 33.2 billion yen ($427 million) for the fiscal year
ending in March, compared with  net income (9107)  of 30.6 billion yen in
the prior period, the mean of 17 analysts’ estimates shows. The
loss will shrink to 11.6 billion yen in the following year.
Shares of the company, which also operates other vessel types,
fell 61 percent this year in  Tokyo  trading.  “Dry bulk has a massive demand driver in China,” said
Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic Securities in Oslo
whose recommendations on shipping companies returned 12 percent
in the past year. “But as vessels keep being built, you
basically need another China to mop up all the ships.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
