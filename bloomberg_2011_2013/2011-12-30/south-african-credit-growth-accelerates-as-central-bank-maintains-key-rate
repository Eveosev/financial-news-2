South African credit increased 6.22
percent last month, the most since April 2009, as the central
bank kept its key lending rate at a 30-year low to support
growth in  Africa ’s largest economy.  Borrowing (SACEIYY)  by households and businesses accelerated from a
5.5 percent gain in October, the Pretoria-based Reserve Bank
said on its website today. The median  estimate (SACEIYY)  in a Bloomberg
survey of five economists was 5.9 percent.  The Reserve Bank has kept the benchmark rate at 5.5 percent
this year to support  consumer spending  as  Europe ’s debt crisis
sapped demand for exports. The economy grew an annualized 1.4
percent in the third quarter, little changed from an almost two-
year low in the previous three months, the statistics office
said on Nov. 29.  Credit extension is “still very modest,” and the increase
is “roughly in line with inflation,” Dennis Dykes, chief
economist at Nedbank Group Ltd., South Africa’s fourth largest
bank, said by telephone from Johannesburg. “That won’t cause
the  Reserve Bank  any particular concern.”  Nedbank now expects the central bank to raise its key rate
by 0.5 percentage points in November and by the same margin in
January 2013, Dykes said. The lender had previously forecast 0.5
percentage-point rate increases in June and September.  The rand traded at 8.1507 per dollar at 9:53 a.m. in
Johannesburg, from 8.1772 before the release of the credit data
and 8.1852 late yesterday.  The broad  M3 (SAMYM3Y)  measure of  money supply  rose 7.23 percent in
November from a year earlier, down from 7.26 percent in October,
the central bank said. The median  estimate (SAMYM3Y)  in a Bloomberg survey
was for M3 to expand 7.45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
