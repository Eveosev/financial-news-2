Nickel traders probably closed bets
that prices will rise as the number of both outstanding
contracts and prices declined.  Open interest (LMFUNIMT)  in London Metal Exchange nickel futures fell
by 4,516 lots to 153,455 lots in the week ended Dec. 28, with
one lot equal to 6 metric tons, according to bourse data. Nickel
for delivery in three months, the benchmark, declined 5.6
percent. Market open interest in nickel futures, which includes
outstanding contracts of both LME members and their clients,
climbed to 170,374 lots on Dec. 16, the highest since at least
September 2005.  When both open interest and prices are falling, it suggests
“long liquidation,” according to Macquarie Group Ltd. Long
positions are bets on higher prices.  Following are changes to the market open interest of both
LME members and their clients, and compiled by the exchange, for
the six biggest industrial metals futures traded on the bourse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
