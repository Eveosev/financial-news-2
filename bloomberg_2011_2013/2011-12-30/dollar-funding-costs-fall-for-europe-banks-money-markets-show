The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined to the lowest in three weeks,
according to a money markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, declined to
114 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 1:26
p.m. in  London . That’s the lowest since Dec. 7 and compares with
minus 118 basis points yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The measure ended 2010 at 60 basis points under the
benchmark.  The one-year basis swap was minus 98 basis points, compared
with minus 101 basis points yesterday. The cost has increased
from 49 basis points under Euribor at the end of last year. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps, was at 97 basis points from 98 yesterday. It was at 101
basis points on Dec. 1, the biggest gap since January 2009.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits (ECBLDEPO)  at the  European
Central Bank , placing 446 billion euros ($578 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based bank yesterday, near a record 452 billion euros
reached on Dec. 27 and up from 437 billion euros yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
