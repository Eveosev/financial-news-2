A Virginia lawyer sued the state’s
Board of Elections and the  Republican Party  seeking to put
former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich ’s name on the March 6
primary ballot after the presidential candidate failed to
collect enough signatures.  The Republican Party of Virginia said Dec. 24 that  Texas 
Governor Rick Perry and Gingrich failed to get signatures from
10,000 registered voters as required to be placed on the ballot.
Many of the signatures collected for Gingrich were improperly
excluded because of a “missing or illegible address,” attorney
 Jonathon Moseley  said in the complaint filed yesterday in state
court in Richmond County.  Gingrich said this week that someone hired to collect
signatures provided false ones. Two other Republicans, former
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas, qualified for the primary scheduled for so-called
Super Tuesday.  Yesterday, Perry lost a bid to stop Virginia election
officials from printing or distributing ballots without his name
on them. A federal judge in Richmond said he wouldn’t stop the
printing before the next hearing in the case, scheduled for Jan.
13. He didn’t rule on the merits of Perry’s challenge.  The case is Jonathon A. Moseley v. Virginia State Board of
Elections, Circuit Court of Richmond County.  To contact the reporter on this story:
