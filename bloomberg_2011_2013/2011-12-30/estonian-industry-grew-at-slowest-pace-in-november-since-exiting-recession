     Dec. 30 (Bloomberg) --Estonian industrial production grew
last month at the slowest pace since it returned to expansion in
January 2010 as  Europe ’s debt crisis damped export demand.  Output advanced 1.1 percent from a year earlier, from a 2.4
percent rise in October, the statistics office in the capital,
Tallinn, said today on its  website . It fell 0.3 percent from the
previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared with a
record 11 percent drop in September.  Industrial production last shrank in December 2009, when
the Baltic nation’s $19 billion economy exited the second-
deepest recession in the European Union behind  Latvia . Gross
domestic product expanded at the fastest pace in the 27-member
EU in the third quarter, growing 8.5 percent from a year earlier
on increased demand for exports from Sweden and  Finland .  Electronics production, led by the Estonian unit of
Ericsson AB, which makes mobile network stations, expanded 19.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
