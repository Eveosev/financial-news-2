Hong Kong  stocks (HSI)  rose for the first
time this week as U.S. home sales grew faster than estimated and
jobless claims fell to the lowest in three years, boosting the
outlook for the world’s largest economy.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , a bank that gets about 20 percent of
revenue from the U.S., climbed 1 percent.  Techtronic Industries
Co. (669) , which makes Ryobi power tools, gained 0.9 percent.  Noble
House China Holdings Ltd. (8246) , an operator of restaurants in the
mainland, surged 40 percent on its first day of trading.  The Hang Seng Index climbed 0.2 percent to 18,434.39 at the
close, snapping two days of losses and paring the gauge’s first
annual decline since 2008. Twenty-two stocks gained while 20
fell in the 48-member benchmark amid volume that was less than
half the 100-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Investors increasingly feel the  U.S. economy  is firmer
than they had expected,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market
analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “The economic data is looking
good and that will boost stock markets, especially when concern
about  Europe ’s debt issues aren’t in the forefront.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
listed in Hong Kong slid 0.1 percent to 9,936.48 after the
country’s manufacturing contracted for a second month amid a
crackdown on property-market speculation and as Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis dented global demand.  Biggest Decliners  The Hang Seng Index fell 20 percent this year as banks and
developers dropped on  China ’s measures to curb inflation and
property prices.  Esprit (330)  Holdings Ltd., a clothier that counts
Europe as its biggest market, led 2011’s declines on the gauge,
falling 73 percent on concern Europe’s failure to contain its
debt crisis will further undermine the brand in its biggest
market.  Measures of industrial goods, raw material and property and
construction companies  fell the most (HSCI)  in the broader Hang Seng
Composite Index this year, tumbling more than 25 percent.
Utilities and telecommunications were the only industries of 11
in the gauge to advance, each rising less than 3 percent.  Companies in the  Hang Seng Index (HSI) , which climbed 1.9 percent
last week, traded at 10 times  forecast earnings (HSI) , down from 14.4
times at the end of last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  traded at 12.8 times.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The benchmark for U.S. stocks rose 1.1 percent
yesterday, restoring the gauge’s 2011 gain, as data signaled the
world’s largest economy is weathering Europe’s debt crisis.  U.S. Reports  HSBC gained 1 percent to HK$59, and Techtronic advanced 0.9
percent to HK$7.99.  Stocks advanced as companies cranked out more goods in
December and pending sales of existing homes jumped in November
for a second month, pointing to a pickup in U.S. economic growth
as 2011 comes to a close. The number of Americans filing claims
for jobless benefits dropped to 375,000 on average over the past
four weeks, the fewest since June 2008, Labor Department figures
showed.  Noble House China (8246)  surged 40 percent to HK$1.01 in its
market debut. Guodian Technology & Environment Group Corp., a
maker of environmental protection equipment, was unchanged from
its initial public offering price of HK$2.16 on its first day of
trading.  Among stocks that fell, China Mengniu Dairy Co., which this
week said excessive levels of a toxin were found in its milk,
slid 1.9 percent to HK$18.16, extending its drop.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.8 percent to 18,456.
The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  retreated 1.4 percent to 24.62,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 7.1 percent in the
benchmark over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
