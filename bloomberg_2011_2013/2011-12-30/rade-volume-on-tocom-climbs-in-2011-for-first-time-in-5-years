Trade volume on the  Tokyo Commodity
Exchange  Inc., which operates  Japan ’s largest raw materials
futures bourse, climbed 14.6 percent this year from a year
earlier, the first annual increase in five years.  Volume totaled 31,670,031 contracts in 2011 from 27,636,367
contracts in 2010, the bourse said in a statement today. Still,
the volume in 2011 was 64 percent lower than the exchange’s
record of 87,252,219 contracts in 2003, the bourse said.  “The increase was because of active bullion trade in
August and September,” Taiki Obuchi, the bourse’s spokesman
said. Gold reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6.  Immediate-delivery gold climbed as much as 1.1 percent to
$1,563.57 an ounce and was at $1,561.20 by 5:08 p.m. in  Tokyo .
The price rose 9.9 percent in 2011, heading for an 11th annual
gain. Spot gold is on track of the longest bull run since at
least 1920 as investors seek to hedge against weakening
currencies, declining equities and rising inflation.  The bourse trades gold, silver, platinum, palladium,
rubber, kerosene, gasoline and crude oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
