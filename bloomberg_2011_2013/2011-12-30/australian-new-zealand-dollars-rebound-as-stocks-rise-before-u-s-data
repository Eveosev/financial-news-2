The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose against most of their 16 major peers as Asian
stocks extended a global rally in equities, indicating added
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie and kiwi, as the currencies are nicknamed,
rebounded from one-week lows before a report next week forecast
to show manufacturing in the U.S. grew, adding to signs the
world’s largest economy is building momentum. Gains in the South
Pacific nations’ currencies were limited amid concern Europe’s
debt crisis is spreading after Italy sold less than its maximum
target at bond auctions yesterday.  Riskier assets will rise “if we can confirm that the  U.S.
economy  is on a recovery path from the economic data next
week,” said  Marito Ueda , senior managing director in  Tokyo  at
FX Prime Corp., a currency-margin company.  The Australian dollar advanced 1.3 percent to $1.0264 at
11:36 a.m. in  New York  from yesterday, when it dropped as low as
$1.0044, the weakest since Dec. 20. The Aussie was at 78.93 yen
from 78.69.  New Zealand’s dollar rose 1.2 percent to 78.04 U.S. cents
from yesterday, when it touched 76.54, the lowest since Dec. 21.
The kiwi fetched 60.02 yen from 59.88.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks rose 0.3 percent and
the Thomson Reuters /Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
advanced 0.6 percent.  In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s factory
 index (MXAP)  probably increased to 53.2 in December from 52.7 in
November, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before the Tempe, Arizona-based group
releases its figures on Jan. 3.  The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent versus the greenback
this year and fell 4.9 percent against the yen. New Zealand’s
currency gained 0.1 percent against the dollar and lost 5
against its Japanese counterpart.  To contact the reporter on this story:
