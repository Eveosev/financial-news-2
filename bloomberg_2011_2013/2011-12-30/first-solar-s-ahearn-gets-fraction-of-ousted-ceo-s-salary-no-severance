First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  interim Chief
Executive Officer Michael Ahearn, who stepped in after former
CEO Rob Gillette was ousted, agreed to a $500,000 annual salary
with no stock awards or options and no severance payment.  Ahearn, 54, will get a base salary that’s 41 percent less
than Gillette and may be eligible for an annual bonus to be
determined by the board, the Tempe, Arizona-based company said
in a  filing (FSLR)  yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Ahearn, who helped found the company in 1999, also
serves as chairman.  The world’s biggest maker of thin-film solar panels lured
Gillette from Honeywell Corp.’s aerospace division more than two
years ago with a $5 million signing bonus, stock awards and a
total compensation package worth as much as $29.9 million for
his first 15 months on the job. First Solar  dropped (FSLR)  61 percent
during his tenure from October 2009 to Oct. 24, the day before
his departure.  First Solar named Ahearn interim CEO on Oct. 25 and the
next day slashed the company’s sales and profit forecasts for
2011. He helped found the company with funding from the Walton
family, heirs of the Wal-Mart Stores Inc. fortune.  To contact the reporter on this story:
