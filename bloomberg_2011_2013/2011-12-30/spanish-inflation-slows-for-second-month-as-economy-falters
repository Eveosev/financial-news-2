Spanish inflation eased for a second
month in December as the euro area’s fourth-largest economy
showed signs of contraction in the final quarter.  Consumer prices (SPCPEUYY) , based on European Union calculations, rose
2.3 percent from a year earlier, slowing from 2.9 percent in
November, the  National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said
today, a day after it reported retail sales fell 7.2 percent in
November from a year earlier, the most since June.  The Bank of  Spain  yesterday confirmed earlier forecasts
that the economy is contracting in the last quarter as tourism
and exports, the drivers of its fragile recovery in the first
half, weakened while household spending and investment worsened.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , whose People’s Party beat the
Socialists in the Nov. 20 election, will announce his first
spending cuts today as he seeks to tackle the euro area’s  third-
largest budget deficit (EUBDEURO)  and the European Union’s highest  jobless
rate (UMRTEMU) .  To contact the reporter on this story:
