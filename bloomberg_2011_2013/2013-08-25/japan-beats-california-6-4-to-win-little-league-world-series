Japan  won baseball’s  Little League 
World Series title for the third time in four years after
rallying to beat a team from Chula Vista,  California , 6-4 in the
championship game.  Shunpei Takagi hit two solo home runs and Ryusei Hirooka
had a two-run double during a three-run fifth inning to help
Musashi Fuchu Little League erase a 4-3 deficit yesterday in
South Williamsport, Pennsylvania.  It was the second Little League World Series victory for
Musashi Fuchu, which also won the championship for 11- and 12-year-olds in 2003.  “We talked about going back to basics, which is what got
us here,” Japan’s manager Masumi Omae was quoted as saying on
the  Little League website  after winning his second title. “The
winning factor in this game and all our games has been trust in
our pitchers to go to the mound and finish innings.”  Eastlake Little League left 11 runners on base in falling
short of becoming the second team from Chula Vista to win the
title in a five-year span. In 2009, Chula Vista’s Park View
Little League defeated a team from  Taiwan  to win the
international championship.  Chula Vista yesterday put two runners on base with one out
in the top of the sixth inning before Japan recorded a double
play to end the game.  Japan has now won nine Little League World Series titles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
