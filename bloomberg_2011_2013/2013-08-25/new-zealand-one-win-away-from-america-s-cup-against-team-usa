Emirates Team New Zealand is one win
away from facing defending champion Oracle Team USA in the
America’s Cup match.  In yesterday’s only race, New Zealand defeated  Italy ’s Luna
Rossa in the Louis Vuitton Cup finals to take a 6-1 lead in the
best-of-13 series. The second race was postponed because of high
winds.  The Kiwis set a race record of more than 54 miles per hour
(47 knots) with their 72-foot (22-meter) catamaran on San
Francisco Bay.  “You can’t help but get a buzz from it,” Team New Zealand
skipper Dean Barker said after the race. “You definitely know
when it’s really ripping because the thing feels like it’s going
to shake itself to pieces.”  Luna Rossa also set a personal speed record of 43.46 knots
(50 mph), helmsman Chris Draper said. The Italian team trailed
the winner by one minute, 58 seconds.  “Ten years ago, we’d have set the world-speed record
today,” Draper said. “Our performance records show we’ve
gotten a lot better, but so have the Kiwis, and they’re
continuing to improve. It’s very, very impressive.”  Two races are scheduled today, and Team New Zealand can
take the series with victory in the first. The America’s Cup
match will begin Sept. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
