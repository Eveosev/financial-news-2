Adam Scott  won the Barclays, the
first playoff event on golf’s U.S. PGA Tour.  Masters Tournament champion Scott, from Australia, shot a
5-under-par 66 in the final round at Liberty National Golf Club
in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey , today, to win the $1.44 million
first prize with a four-round total of 11-under-par 273.  Justin Rose  missed a putt for par at the 18th hole to
finish a shot behind Scott after a 3-under-par 68. Rose, the
U.S. Open champion from England, tied for second place at 10-under with Tiger Woods, Graham DeLaet of Canada and Gary
Woodland of the U.S.  Woods, who has struggled with a back injury during the
tournament, birdied No. 17 to move to 10-under. The world’s top-ranked player then failed to force a playoff as his putt for
birdie at the last hole stopped just before reaching the cup.
Woodland, in the last group, then missed a birdie attempt from
about 10 feet on the 18th green to join Scott at 11-under.  The top 100 players in the FedExCup points list following
the Barclays advance to the second of four playoff tournaments,
the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston from Aug. 30 to
Sept. 2. After that, the top 70 move on to the BMW Championship
outside  Chicago  from Sept. 12 to 15.  The top 30 in the standings then compete for the FedExCup
title and the $10 million bonus at the Tour Championship in
Atlanta from Sept. 19 to 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
