The Pentagon is seeking a 50 percent
increase in funds to support foreign militaries and training in
the Southeast  Asia  region, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
said in  Kuala Lumpur  today.  “Our most recent budget includes $90 million for Foreign
Military Financing and International Military Education and
Training programs in Southeast Asia,” Hagel said in prepared
remarks to be delivered at Malaysia’s Ministry of Defense. The
budget request represents a 50 percent increase compared with
four years ago, he said.  The Foreign Military Financing  program  provides grants or
loans to help other countries buy U.S. weapons. The military
education program pays for foreign officers to study and train
with U.S. forces.  As part of the U.S. strategy to rebalance forces toward the
Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon also is stepping up weapons
sales and transfers of technology, Hagel said.  “We are also increasing commercial defense trade, and
ultimately envision moving towards co-production and co-development of new platforms with our closest partners in the
region,” Hagel said. “This will allow us to share American
technology and expertise which will further deepen our security
partnerships.”  Hagel is on a week-long visit to Asia and plans to visit
 Indonesia , Brunei and the Philippines. In Brunei he will attend
the Asean Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus, a gathering of the 10
defense ministers from the region as well as eight other nations
with interests in  Southeast Asia , including the U.S., China and
 Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
