English Premier League soccer team
Chelsea agreed to buy Brazilian forward Willian from Russian
club Anzhi Makhachkala.  “Chelsea Football Club can confirm an agreement has been
reached with both Willian and his club,” the team said  on its
website . “The transfer is subject to a work permit hearing on
Wednesday.”  Chelsea didn’t reveal financial terms. The  Daily Mail  said
the transfer fee for the Brazilian national team player is 30
million pounds ($46.7 million).  Willian, whose full name is Willian Borges da Silva, was
poised to join Chelsea’s London rival Tottenham Hotspur after
having a medical examination there last week before Chelsea came
in with its own offer.  The 25-year-old began his professional career with Brazil’s
Corinthians and moved to Ukraine’s Shakhtar Donetsk in 2007. He
switched to Anzhi in January this year.  Chelsea manager  Jose Mourinho  has had two bids for
Manchester United striker  Wayne Rooney  rejected, and the Blues
are now in talks to sign Anzhi’s Samuel Eto’o, Sky Sports
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
