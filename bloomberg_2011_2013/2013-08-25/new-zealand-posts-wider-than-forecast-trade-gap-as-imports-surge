New Zealand  posted its widest trade
deficit since September as imports neared a five-year high on
purchases of helicopters, machinery and crude oil. The Kiwi
dollar declined.  Imports exceeded exports by NZ$774 million ($604 million)
in July,  Statistics New Zealand  said in Wellington today. That
compares with the median forecast of a NZ$16 million deficit in
a Bloomberg News survey of 10 economists.  New Zealand’s currency fell as exports also declined from a
year ago.  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler
last week said the nation’s currency was over-valued and
continued to pose a headwind to exports.  Imports rose 17 percent from a year earlier to NZ$4.62
billion. Economists expected imports of NZ$3.9 billion  Purchases of aircraft and parts rose to NZ$276 million,
comprising mainly helicopters, the statistics agency said. The
government has been upgrading the air force helicopter fleet.
Excluding aircraft, imports rose 11 percent to NZ$4.3 billion --
the highest since November. Crude oil imports increased by
NZ$200 million from July last year.  Exports fell 4.8 percent from a year earlier, led by dairy
products. The volume of milk powder, butter and cheese dropped
37 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
