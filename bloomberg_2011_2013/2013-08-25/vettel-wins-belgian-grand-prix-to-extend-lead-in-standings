Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull won
today’s Belgian Grand Prix to extend his lead in the Formula One
drivers’ standings.  Fernando Alonso  of Ferrari was second, 16.9 seconds behind,
and Mercedes’s Lewis Hamilton came third after the 44-lap race
at Spa-Francorchamps.  It was Vettel’s fifth victory this season and the 31st of
his career. He also won the Belgian race two years ago.  Germany’s Vettel, 26, who’s seeking a fourth straight
drivers’ title, overtook pole-sitter Hamilton on the first lap
and never lost command of the race.  “It was a fantastic race, from start to finish really.
Once I got past Lewis we had incredible pace and could control
the race,” Vettel said at the post-race ceremony. “I really
enjoyed that a lot.”  Nico Rosberg of Mercedes was fourth, ahead of Red
Bull’s Mark Webber, McLaren’s  Jenson Button ,  Felipe Massa  of
Ferrari and Romain Grosjean of Lotus. Force India’s  Adrian Sutil 
and Toro Rosso’s Daniel Ricciardo rounded out the scoring
positions.  Vettel extended his lead to 46 points. Alonso overtook
Lotus’s  Kimi Raikkonen  to go second in the standings. Raikkonen
dropped out of today’s race with a mechanical problem.  Vettel has 197 points, followed by Alonso (151), Hamilton
(139), Raikkonen (134) and Webber (115).  Today’s race was the first after the mid-season break. The
next event, the 12th on the 19-race calendar, is the Italian
Grand Prix at Monza on Sept. 8.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
