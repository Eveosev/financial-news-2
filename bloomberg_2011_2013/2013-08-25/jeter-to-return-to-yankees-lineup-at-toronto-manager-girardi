Shortstop  Derek Jeter  is expected to
be in the lineup for the New York Yankees tomorrow in a game
against the  Toronto Blue Jays , manager  Joe Girardi  said.  “That’s the plan,” Girardi said on the team’s website.  Jeter grounded out twice and singled in the sixth inning
for the Triple A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Railriders in his third
and final rehabilitation game yesterday. The Railriders lost 5-4
in 10 innings to the Pawtucket Red Sox.  Jeter returned to the 15-day disabled list with a strained
right calf muscle Aug. 5 after playing his fifth game this
season.  Jeter, 39, missed the first 91 games of the Major League
Baseball season while recovering from a fractured left ankle. He
strained a thigh muscle while running the bases in his season
debut on July 11, forcing him to miss 12 more games.  Jeter is hitting .211 with one home run and two runs batted
in this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
