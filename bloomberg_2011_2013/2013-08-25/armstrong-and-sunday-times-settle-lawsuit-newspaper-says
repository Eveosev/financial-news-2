The Sunday Times newspaper said it 
reached an undisclosed settlement with  Lance Armstrong , the 
cyclist who admitted to cheating with drugs, after it sued him for 
more than 1 million pounds ($1.56 million).   Armstrong had sued the London-based newspaper for libel in 
2004 after it published an article that suggested he may have 
used performance-enhancing drugs. The American denied doing so 
and was paid 300,000 pounds by the newspaper in 2006 after it
settled that lawsuit, The Sunday Times said.  Armstrong cheated in all seven of his Tour de  France  wins,
he said in an interview with  Oprah Winfrey  that was televised in
January. The newspaper then sued him alleging deceit and that
case has now been settled, the Sunday Times said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
