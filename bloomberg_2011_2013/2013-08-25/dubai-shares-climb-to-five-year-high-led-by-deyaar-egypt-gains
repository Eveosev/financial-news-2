Dubai stocks  rose to the highest
since November 2008 as  Deyaar Development PJSC (DEYAAR)  and  Union
Properties (UPP)  PJSC surged on bets the shares are cheap amid a
recovery in property prices in the Persian Gulf tourist hub.  Deyaar, which today said it was holding a press conference
Sept. 1 to announce a new project, soared the most since March
2012 as trading volumes climbed to more than 10 times the three-month daily average. Union Properties jumped 15 percent to the
highest since January 2010. Dubai’s DFM General Index advanced
1.8 percent to 2,748.27 at the close in the emirate.  Today’s gains brought this year’s advance for Deyaar to 63
percent and for Union Properties to 58 percent. That compares
with a surge of 67 percent for  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the
developer of the world’s tallest tower, and 69 percent for
Dubai’s benchmark index. The emirate is benefiting from an
economic and real-estate recovery, with apartment prices in
Dubai rising 17 percent in June from a year ago and those of
villas increasing 12 percent, according to data from Jones Lang
LaSalle.  House prices  had dropped more than 65 percent from a
peak in 2008 as the global credit crisis crimped lending.  “These two companies were the laggards of the Dubai market
and this is a kind of catch up trade,” Sebastien Henin, a
portfolio manager at The National Investor, said by phone from
Abu Dhabi today. The shares, which are penny stocks and “highly
speculative,” also broke a “major resistance,” which spurred
buying by retail investors, he said.  Rate Decision  Deyaar and Union Properties trade at about 0.8 times book
value, compared with a multiple of almost 1.2 for Emaar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Deyaar soared 15
percent to 57.2 fils, while Union Properties closed at 62.4
fils. There are 100 fils to the dirham.  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , Dubai’s biggest bank and the largest
shareholder in Union Properties, rose 2.7 percent to 5.75
dirhams, the highest since May 20.  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) , the Middle
East’s biggest low-cost carrier, advanced 4.3 percent to 1.45
dirhams, the highest since September 2008.  Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark index advanced for a fifth day,
gaining 0.3 percent, while Oman’s measure added 0.2 percent and
Egypt’s EGX30 increased 0.9 percent.  Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index lost 0.8 percent,
led by Riyadh-based  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , which declined 1.3 percent.
Kuwait’s measure fell 0.4 percent, Qatar’s 0.3 percent and
Bahrain’s 0.2 percent.  In Israel, the TA-25 Index retreated 0.2 percent as the
yield on the benchmark government bond due March 2023 declined
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.98 percent.
The  Bank of Israel  will hold rates at 1.25 percent tomorrow,
according to 20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
