U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
said the U.S. is still weighing evidence that the Syrian
government used chemical weapons against rebels, and is
consulting allies on possible action against the regime led by
President Bashar al-Assad.  Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur at the start of a
week-long visit to the region, Hagel said no decisions had been
reached after he participated in a conference call with
President  Barack Obama ’s national security team yesterday.  “There are risks and consequences for any option that
would be used or not used, and for any action or inaction,”
Hagel said. Those consequences are being weighed, he said when
asked how the U.S., should it take military action, is preparing
for any potential chemical-weapons use by the Assad regime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
