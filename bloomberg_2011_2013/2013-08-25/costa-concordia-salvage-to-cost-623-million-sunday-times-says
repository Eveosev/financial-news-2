Costa Concordia, the luxury cruiser
that capsized off the Italian coast last year, will be put back
on its keel next month in a complex maneuver that will cost 400
million pounds ($623 million), the Sunday Times reported.  The operation to lift the 952-foot (290-meter), 114,500-ton
ship will be undertaken in one day. The liner will rest on
underwater platforms built under the hull using 18,000 tons of
cement, the newspaper reported, citing Nick Sloane, the South
African engineer heading the team of 500 salvage workers.  The Costa Concordia struck a rock off the western coast of
 Italy  in January 2012, leaving 32 dead. Captain Francesco Schettino was indicted in May on charges of manslaughter and
abandoning the ship while many of the 4,200 passengers and crew
were still on board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
