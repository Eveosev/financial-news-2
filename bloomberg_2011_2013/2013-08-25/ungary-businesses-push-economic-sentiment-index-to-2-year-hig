Hungary ’s economic-sentiment index
jumped to its strongest level in more than two years in August
as increased optimism among businesses outweighed a drop in
 consumer confidence .  The index rose to minus 14.3, the best reading since June
2011, from minus 15.5 in July, the GKI research institute in
Budapest said in an e-mailed statement. Business confidence
increased to minus 6.3, also a 26-month high, from minus 8.6 in
July, while the consumer-confidence gauge fell to minus 36.9
from minus 35.3.  Services led the improvement in business confidence, while
the sub-indexes for industrial and construction companies also
grew slightly, GKI said. Households became more pessimistic
about the economy’s outlook, it said.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who leads polls before
elections next year, is struggling to revive Hungary’s economy.
Gross domestic product advanced 0.1 percent from the previous
three months in the second quarter and the government predicts
it will rise 0.7 percent this year.  GKI’s indexes are calculated as a balance of positive and
negative answers to questions about the outlook for the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
