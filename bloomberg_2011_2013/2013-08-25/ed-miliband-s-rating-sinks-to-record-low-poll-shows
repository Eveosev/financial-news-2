Ed Miliband  is losing ground against
Prime Minister  David Cameron , with only one in five voters
satisfied with the Labour leader’s performance, an ICM poll for
the Sunday Telegraph showed.  The percentage of respondents saying Miliband is doing a
good job plunged to 21 percent, from 34 percent in September
2011, the newspaper reported. With 51 percent describing his
track record as bad, his personal rating has fallen to a record
low, the Sunday Telegraph said.  Thirty-two percent say they are happy with the Conservative
leaders’ track record, according to the poll. At the party
level, it gave Labour 32 percent of the vote and the Tories 30
percent.  “It’s difficult to imagine that things could be any worse
for him, or indeed how he can succeed in turning the public
around,” ICM Director Martin Boon said about Miliband’s rating
in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph.  The Labour leader has been criticized for his communication
style and has yet to clarify his position on the referendum on
European Union membership at his party’s conference in Brighton
next month.  The poll of 2,013 people was conducted online between Aug.
21 and Aug. 23. The Liberal Democrats attracted 16 percent of
the votes, while the U.K. Independence Party garnered 12
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
