The  Buffalo Bills  added a pair of
quarterbacks following preseason injuries to  Kevin Kolb  and E.J. Manuel, signing  Matt Leinart  as a free agent and acquiring
Thaddeus Lewis in a trade with the Detroit Lions.  Kolb left the Bills’ preseason loss against the Washington
Redskins two days ago because of concussion-like symptoms.
Manuel, a first-round draft pick this year, will miss the rest
of the preseason with a left knee injury.  Leinart, 30, has played with the Oakland Raiders, Houston
Texans and Arizona Cardinals over the past four National
Football League seasons. A first-round draft pick of the
Cardinals in 2006, Leinart won college football’s Heisman Trophy
at the University of Southern California in 2004.  Lewis, 25, spent the past two seasons with the Cleveland
Browns -- mostly as a member of their practice squad -- before
starting the team’s 2012 regular-season finale. The Bills sent
linebacker Chris White to the Lions for Lewis, who entered the
NFL in 2010 as an undrafted free agent from Duke University.  The Bills host the  New England Patriots  in their regular-season opener on Sept. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
