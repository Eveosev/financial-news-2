The number of working Britons over
65 has tripled in 15 years, the Observer reported today, citing
the results of a survey commissioned by the Trades Union
Congress.  The survey found 258,000 women and 338,000 men are still
working past the state retirement age, compared with 93,000 and
112,000 respectively in 1998. Thatâ€™s still fewer people than in
other developed countries, the Observer cited Giselle Cory, a
research and policy analyst at London-based think-tank
Resolution Foundation, as saying.  If Britain matched the employment rates of the leading
countries in this field, a further 1.5 million over the age of
50 would be in work, Cory said.  London  and the South-East have the highest percentages of
people aged 65 or more in employment, while the North East has
the lowest, according to the Office for National Statistics.
While a third take on full-time jobs, most of them work part-time, the ONS says on its website.  The retirement age in the U.K. is currently 65 for men and
60 for women. By 2020, it will be raised to 66 for both men and
women, and again to 67 by 2028.  To contact the reporter on this story:
