Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  placed four
senior technology specialists on administrative leave after a
programming error caused the investment bank to send faulty
stock-options orders last week, the Financial Times reported.  The newspaper cited a person familiar with the events and
didn’t disclose the names of the four employees.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the FT report yesterday.  An internal system that Goldman Sachs uses to help prepare
to meet market demand for equity options inadvertently produced
orders with inaccurate price limits and sent them to exchanges,
a person familiar with the situation told Bloomberg News after
the Aug. 20 mishap.  The malfunction caused unintended options orders to flood
U.S. exchanges, roiling markets and shaking confidence in
electronic-trading infrastructure. Two days later, Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. halted trading for three hours after an unrelated
failure left some investors without stock quotes. Last year,
Knight Capital Group Inc. almost went out of business after the
firm flooded U.S. equity markets with erroneous orders.  Most of last week’s faulty options trades have been
canceled, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told
 Bloomberg News , a decision that will limit losses for Goldman
Sachs. The bank, the fifth-biggest in the U.S. by assets, stands
to lose tens of millions of dollars, the FT reported, without
disclosing how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
