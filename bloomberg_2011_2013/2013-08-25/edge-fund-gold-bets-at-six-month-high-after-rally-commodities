Hedge funds  and other speculators
raised bets on higher  gold prices  to the most in six months as
signs of slowing U.S. growth drove bullion above $1,400 an ounce
for the first time since June.  The net-long position increased 29 percent to 73,216
 futures and options  by Aug. 20, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Short contracts fell for a second week and
to the lowest since Feb. 12. Net-bullish  holdings  across 18
U.S.-traded commodities jumped 34 percent, the most since July
2010, as wagers on copper and soybeans more than doubled.  Gold, down 28 percent from its record high, has rallied 18
percent from a 34-month low in June. Asian demand for jewelry
surged as prices tumbled into a  bear market . Sales of new  homes 
in the U.S. declined more than 13 percent in July and consumer
 confidence  fell in the week ended Aug. 18, increasing
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will look for more signs of
growth before easing stimulus that debases the dollar.  “Physical demand is very strong, and that is lending
support to prices, and we think it’s time to increase our
holdings,” said Michael Mullaney, the Boston-based chief
investment officer for Fiduciary Trust Co., which manages about
$10 billion of assets. “The economy is improving, but there are
some misses, which intensify the debate on tapering and
increases demand for gold as a safe-haven investment.”  Gold Rally  Futures fell 0.2 percent to settle at $1,393.10 on the
Comex in  New York , after gaining 1.8 percent last week to
$1,395.80. Spot prices topped $1,400 on Aug. 23. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities slid 0.1 percent last
week, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities dropped
0.3 percent. The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a gauge against 10
major trading partners, rose 0.4 percent.  Policy makers are weighing when to begin curbing $85
billion of monthly bond purchases that they pledged to maintain
until the job market improves. Gold rose 70 percent from
December 2008 to June 2011 as the U.S. central bank pumped more
than $2 trillion into the financial system by purchasing debt,
increasing investors’ concern about currency debasement and
accelerating inflation.  Fed Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard , who has
supported record Fed stimulus, said on Aug. 23 the central bank
should pledge not to raise record-low  interest rates  as long as
inflation is below 1.5 percent. The metal may rally to $1,482 as
soon as October if Fed tapering is delayed to December, Barclays
Plc said Aug. 23.  Waning Faith  Gold’s rally probably will fade by the end of the year as
the dollar strengthens, bond yields rise and investor faith in
the metal as a store of value wanes, Morgan Stanley said in a
report dated Aug. 22. Prices fell 17 percent this year, heading
for the first annual decline since 2000.  “It’s hard to be bullish on gold when there is no
inflation and the global economy is healing,” said  John Stephenson , who helps oversee about C$2.7 billion ($2.6 billion)
at First Asset Investment Management Inc. in Toronto.  The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee policy
meeting in July, released Aug. 21, said central bankers were
“broadly comfortable” with Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to
start reducing bond buying later this year if the economy
improves. The officials are scheduled to meet next in September.  Twelve analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect gold to fall
this week, eight were bullish and two neutral. That’s the
highest proportion of bears since June 21, a week before prices
plunged to $1,179.40, the lowest since August 2010.  ETP Holdings  Investors sold 684.64 metric tons of gold held in  exchange-traded products  this year, erasing $54.3 billion from the
combined value of the funds. The  decline  may reach 700 tons in
2013, Barclays estimates.  As gold dropped into a bear market during the second
quarter, billionaires  George Soros  and  Daniel Loeb  sold their
entire  investments  in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest ETP,
filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed
Aug. 14. Paulson & Co., the largest  investor  in the fund, cut
its stake by 53 percent, the data show.  The slump in prices forced mining companies to announce at
least $26 billion of writedowns in the past two months, and
Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp., the biggest producer, said
Aug. 1 it may sell, close or curb output at 12 mines from  Peru 
to  Papua New Guinea .  Physical Demand  The drop in prices spurred a surge in demand for gold in
 Asia , helping bullion to rally for a second month. Sales of
jewelry, coins and bars will reach as much as 1,000 tons in both
India and  China  in 2013, valued at a combined $87.6 billion, the
World Gold Council estimates. That would beat China’s 2011
record of 778.6 tons and be near India’s all-time high of
1,006.5 tons in 2010.  Bank of America Corp. predicts a fourth-quarter average of
$1,495 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. anticipates rising averages in
every quarter through the end of next year.  Money managers added $421 million to precious-metal funds
in the week ended Aug. 21, the most in 33 weeks, according to
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which tracks money
flows. Commodity funds had inflows of $583 million.  Commodity Holdings  Net-long positions in  copper  jumped 104 percent to 14,356
contracts, CFTC data show. Money managers turned bullish a week
earlier, after betting on lower prices for 24 consecutive weeks,
the longest bearish stretch since July 2009. Prices are heading
for the biggest monthly gain since September amid speculation
that China’s growth is gaining traction.  A preliminary purchasing managers index for China by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics rose to 50.1 from 47.7 in
July, exceeding all 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Bullish bets on crude oil slipped for the fourth straight
week, to 302,762 contracts, CFTC data show. Prices are heading
for the third straight monthly gain amid concern that violence
in the  Middle East  may disrupt supply.  A measure of net-long positions across 11 agricultural
products more than doubled to 215,958 futures and options,
government data show. The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index of eight
commodities rose for the second straight week.  Soybean  holdings  jumped 112 percent to 99,988 contracts,
while the net-short position in corn shrank to 91,778 contracts,
from a record 123,221 a week earlier.  Billion Bushels  The U.S. corn harvest will be 13.46 billion bushels, less
than the 13.763 billion estimated this month by the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture ,  Cedar Falls , Iowa-based Professional
Farmers of America said in a report Aug. 23. That followed a
four-day tour last week of 2,600 fields in seven Midwest states.
Soybean output will be 3.158 billion bushels, below the USDA
forecast of 3.255 billion. The U.S. is the world’s largest
grower of both crops.  “We have seen renewed interest in commodities,” said
Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion of assets
at B&T Wealth Management in Birmingham,  Alabama . “News out of
China coupled with expectations of continued easing from the Fed
will keep the commodities pack stronger.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
