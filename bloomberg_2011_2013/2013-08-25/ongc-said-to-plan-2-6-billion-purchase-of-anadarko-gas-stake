Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , India’s
biggest energy explorer, plans to pay about $2.6 billion to buy
 Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) ’s stake in a Mozambique gas field, two
people with direct knowledge of the matter said.  ONGC may announce the purchase of Anadarko’s 10 percent
holding in the offshore block as soon as today, the people said,
asking not to be identified before a formal announcement.  The New Delhi-based company plans to spend 11 trillion
rupees ($172 billion) by 2030 to add reserves in India and
overseas and reverse a decline in output from aging fields at
home. In June, ONGC and  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  said they would pay $2.5
billion to buy a stake in the Rovuma-1 Mozambique natural gas
field from Videocon Industries Ltd.  ONGC  rose  2.6 percent to close at 276.70 rupees in Mumbai
on Aug. 23, bringing gains this year to 3.3 percent. Anadarko
shares have advanced 21 percent in 2013.  ONGC Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva declined to comment. A call
made to Anadarko spokesman  John Christiansen ’s mobile phone
outside of regular business hours went unanswered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
