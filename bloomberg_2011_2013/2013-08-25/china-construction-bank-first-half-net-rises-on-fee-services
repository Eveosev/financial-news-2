China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the
nationâ€™s second-largest lender, said first-half profit rose 13
percent to a record as income from lending and fee-based
services gained.  Net income climbed to 119.7 billion  yuan  ($19.6 billion),
or 0.48 yuan a share, from 106.3 billion yuan, or 0.43 yuan, a
year earlier, the Beijing-based lender said in a statement to
the Shanghai stock exchange today. That exceeded the 117.8
billion yuan median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
