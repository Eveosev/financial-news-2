Partner Communications Co. (PTNR) , Israel’s
second-largest mobile phone provider, is beating analysts’
average share price estimate by the most since 2010 on prospects
the company will report record sales growth this week.  American depositary receipts of Partner gained 1.4 percent
in  New York  to $8.11, the highest since February 2012, to trade
at a premium to the shares in  Tel Aviv  for the first time in
eight days. The Israel shares today widened the gap, slipping
1.3 percent to 28.66 shekels, or $7.98, at the close in Tel
Aviv.  Partner’s share premium versus the average analyst target
price reached 6.28 shekels ($1.75) last week, the highest level
since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap was
the third-biggest among telecommunication companies in the
 Middle East  and  Africa , the data show. The Rosh Ha’Ayin, Israel-based company is scheduled to report earnings on Aug. 28, less
than two weeks after  Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)  said average revenue
per user increased for the first time in three years.  “The market expectation is that Partner’s second-quarter
earnings report is going to be as strong as Cellcom’s,” Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at Ramat-Gan, Israel-based Excellence
Nessuah Brokerage Ltd., said by phone Aug. 23. “There is a
sentiment change in the market because the industry is getting
ready to improve.”  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Israeli stocks in New York fell 0.1 percent to 97.47, trimming
its gain for the week to 0.1 percent. The gauge rose for the
first time in three weeks, led by Prolor Biotech Inc., which
advanced 7.3 percent, while  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  fell 5.9
percent. The benchmark TA-25 Index of equities today slipped 0.2
percent.  Price Estimate  The ADRs have outperformed analysts expectations for a
third month in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
consensus target price on Partner’s stock is 22.86 shekels,
according to the mean estimate of 11 analysts, a 21 percent
discount to the Aug. 22 closing price of 29.03 shekels.  “This means the analysts will probably upgrade the stock
and the gap will close,” Bloomberg Industries analyst Erhan Gurses said by phone from London Aug. 23. “Investors have been
more optimistic about the stock than the analysts.”  The company is  expected  to say that second-quarter net
income before special items was 43.4 million shekels ($12.4
million), a 64 percent drop from the year-ago period, according
to the mean of three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue increased 42 percent to 2.02 billion shekels, according
to the survey.  Cellcom’s Gain  Cellcom’s average revenue per user increased 3.8 shekels in
the three months through June compared with the previous
quarter, the first advance in three years, it said in a
statement Aug. 19. Net income slumped 45 percent to 66 million
shekels. The company, the second-best performer on the TA-25
index this year with a gain of 36 percent, advanced 5.3 percent
to a 15-month high of $11.72 in New York last week.  Prolor Biotech Inc. (PBTH) , which is developing a long-acting
version of human growth hormone that’s in the final stage of
clinical trials, rose 1.3 percent to $7.98 in New York Aug. 23,
expanding its gain last week to 7.3 percent. The Tel Aviv shares
today advanced 2.1 percent to 28.91 shekels, or $8.05.  Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc. (PLX)  gained 3.4 percent last week
to $5.20, settling at a 1.6 percent premium to the company’s
shares in Tel Aviv. The Israel shares today advanced 0.4 percent
to 18.42 shekels, or $5.13.  Alon Blue Square Israel Ltd. (BSI)  settled at a 2.8 percent
discount to the company’s shares in Tel Aviv after losing 3
percent in New York last week to $3.51. The  Israel  shares today
declined 1 percent to 12.82 shekels, or $3.57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
