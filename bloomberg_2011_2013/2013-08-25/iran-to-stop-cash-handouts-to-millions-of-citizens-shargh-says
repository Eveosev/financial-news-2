Iran  will stop paying monthly cash
handouts to citizens who don’t need the aid,  Shargh  reported
today, citing a member of parliament.  The change will be implemented in the new Iranian year
staring March 21 and will appear in the budget draft that
President Hassan Rohani’s government plans to submit by Dec. 21,
said Ali Mohammad Ahmadi, a member of the assembly’s planning
and budgetary committee, according to the Tehran-based
newspaper.  The decision to cut monthly handouts to several million
Iranians will still fulfill the initial goal of the subsidy
reform plan and better safeguard the nation’s resources, Shargh
said. Rohani, who started his term earlier this month, has
pledged to revive an economy battered by international sanctions
and marked by a weakened national currency and an inflation
nearing 38 percent.  Iran started a five-year plan in 2010 under former
president  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s government, phasing out energy
and food subsidies and replacing them with cash payments to make
up for rising costs. While the plan aimed to target Iranians in
need of aid, all those who enrolled became eligible and some 75
million people are receiving payments, Shargh said.  Iran’s population is 76.8 million according to the data
today on the website of  Iran’s Statistics Center . The government
makes monthly payment of 455,000 rials ($18) to each eligible
Iranian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
