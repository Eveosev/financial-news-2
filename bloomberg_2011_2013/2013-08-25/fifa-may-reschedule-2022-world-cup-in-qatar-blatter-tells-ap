FIFA President Sepp Blatter expects
the executive committee of soccer’s ruling body to switch the
2022  World Cup  in Qatar from summer, the  Associated Press 
reported, citing an interview.  Blatter told AP an Oct. 3-4 committee meeting in Zurich
should approve the change and begin talks on deciding the best
time for Qatar to host the tournament. He said he’d be “more
than surprised if the ExCo will not accept the principle you
cannot play in summer in Qatar.”  There’s concern that Qatar’s summer temperatures of 50
degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) would be unsafe for
players, although  England ’s Premier League and other national
soccer bodies are opposed to switching the tournament to the
European winter, saying this would cause scheduling problems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
