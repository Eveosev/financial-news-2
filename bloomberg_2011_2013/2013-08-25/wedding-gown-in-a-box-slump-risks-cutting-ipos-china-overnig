The 48 percent slump in
 LightInTheBox Holding Co. (LITB) , the Chinese online discount retailer
that sold shares in the U.S. this year, risks reducing the price
for the nation’s companies seeking to go public, IPOX Schuster
LLC said.  American depositary receipts of LightInTheBox plunged below
their June 6 debut level last week, after the Beijing-based
company said sales will decline. The ADRs posted the biggest
slump on the Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks. The measure added 0.7 percent last week, led by
 NetEase Inc. (NTES)  and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  China Telecom Corp. traded at
the biggest premium to the Hong Kong shares in two weeks.  LightInTheBox, whose $80 wedding gowns and $2 iPhone
gadgets are manufactured in  China  and sold in the U.S. and
 Europe , reported on Aug. 19 second-quarter sales that failed to
surpass analysts’ estimates and said revenue will decline in the
following three months. The earnings miss could reduce future
IPO prices at a time Baidu Inc.’s travel unit Qunar.com and
operator of literary websites Cloudary Corp. plan to sell shares
in the U.S., according to IPOX.  “It’s definitely going to affect perceptions about Chinese
IPOs in the U.S.,” Josef Schuster, the founder of IPOX, an
investment firm based in  Chicago  with about $2.5 billion under
management, said by phone Aug. 23. “If you don’t meet your
revenues promise, you get your multiples slashed, that’s what
happened with LightInTheBox. I am 100 percent sure it’s going to
affect all the IPO pricing going forward.”  ‘Different Animal’  Bill Zima, LightInTheBox’s external investor relations
manager at ICR Inc., wasn’t available by telephone or e-mail Aug.
23.  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) , an online fashion retailer based in
Guangzhou that listed in the U.S. in March last year, has
multiplied its IPO price sixfold to $40.47 as of last week.  YY
Inc. (YY) , a social media website also based in Guangzhou, has more
than tripled since its IPO in November.  LightInTheBox’s ADRs plunged to $9.87 last week following a
four-day slide. After pricing at $9.5 per ADR, it jumped as much
as 134 percent to $22.21 on Aug. 14.  LightInTheBox probably surged initially “because Vipshop
has done so well as it met revenue targets and is very
successful in the secondary market,” according to Schuster.
“LightInTheBox is a different animal.”  Second-quarter revenue at LightInTheBox was $72.2 million,
 4.7 percent short  of the average estimate of four analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. It forecast in an Aug. 19 statement sales
for July-September that also missed average projections by as
much as 14 percent. Credit Suisse Group AG downgraded the
company’s rating to the equivalent of sell last week.  Hang Seng  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.4 percent to 2,086.49
at 12:02 p.m. local time after benchmark gauges fell last week.
The  Hang Seng  China Enterprises index of Hong Kong-listed
Chinese companies climbed 1.8 percent.  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., slipped 1.4 percent last week
to $35.66, losing the most in seven weeks. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index added 0.5 percent in its the first weekly gain in
three weeks, as investors watched Federal Reserve officials for
signals on stimulus cuts after data showed home sales plunged.  NetEase, owner of a Chinese news portal, soared 19 percent
in the five days to a record high of $75.42, the biggest weekly
gain since February 2006.  The Beijing-based company started Yichat, a social instant
messaging application last week, through a joint venture with
China Telecom, the nation’s third-largest wireless network
carrier. Downloads surpassed 1 million in the 24 hours after the
application was introduced, China Telecom said.  China Telecom  China Telecom climbed 3.5 percent last week to a three-month high of $52.90. Its ADRs, each representing 100 underlying
shares in Beijing-based China Telecom, traded 0.8 percent above
its Hong Kong stock, the widest  premium  since Aug. 8.  Trina Solar , China’s third-largest panel maker, jumped 32
percent last week to $9.44, the steepest weekly advance this
year. Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. rallied 13 percent for the
week while LDK Solar Co. gained 10 percent.  Trina raised its annual shipment forecast Aug. 20 after
sales climbed to a record in the second quarter thanks to Asian
demand. Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James &
Associates Inc. upgraded Trina to a hold equivalent Aug. 23,
saying China is “on the cusp” of becoming the top driver of
global photovoltaic demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
