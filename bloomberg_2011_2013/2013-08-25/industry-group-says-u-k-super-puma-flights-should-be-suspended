All Super Puma helicopter flights to
and from offshore U.K. oil and gas installations should be
suspended, an industry safety lobby  said .  Flights should only resume when there is “sufficient
factual information to support the decision,” Step Change in
Safety said in a statement yesterday. Oil & Gas U.K., a lobby
group, has arranged a meeting of industry contractors tomorrow
to discuss the implications of the suspension and how to
minimize its impact.  Four people died when a helicopter carrying 18 people for
 Total SA (FP)  crashed into the sea off the Shetland Islands on Aug.
23. The aircraft was operated by CHC Helicopter Corp., which
transports oil and gas platform workers in the area. CHC has
suspended all flights from Aberdeen as a mark of respect
following the crash, the company said in a statement yesterday.  The Sea Puma is made by the Eurocopter unit of European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
