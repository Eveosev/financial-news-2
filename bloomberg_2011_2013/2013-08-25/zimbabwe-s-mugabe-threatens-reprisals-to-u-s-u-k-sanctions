Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
threatened to target Western firms in a response to continued
U.S. and U.K. sanctions against his country.  “They should not continue to harass us,” Mugabe told
mourners attending the burial of a liberation war veteran in
Harare today. “Time will come when we will say well, tit for
tat, you hit me and I hit you.”  Mugabe last month extended his 33-year rule of the southern
African country as his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front secured a two-thirds parliamentary majority in elections
that his rival Morgan Tsvangirai said were rigged. Mugabe has
promised to persist with policy whereby miners such as
Johannesburg-listed  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  and banks,
including a unit of London-based  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , will be
forced to accede majority stakes to locals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
