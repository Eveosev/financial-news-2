Doosan Heavy Industries &
Construction Co., a South Korea maker of power equipment, said
today it signed a $103 million contract to build a desalination
plant in  Chile .  The facility will have capacity to produce 220,000 tons of
water per day from mid-2016, for supply to the  Escondida  copper
mine, the world’s largest source of copper, the company said in
an e-mailed statement.  Water produced at the plant near Chile’s coastal city of
Antofagasta will be piped 180 kilometers (112 miles) to the
copper mine situated 3,000 meters above sea level, according to
the statement.  Doosan won the contract in competition with water facility
builders including France’s Degremont SA and Spain’s  Acciona SA (ANA) ,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
