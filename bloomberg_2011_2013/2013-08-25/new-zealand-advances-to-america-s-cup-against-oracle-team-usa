Team  New Zealand  won the Louis
Vuitton Cup to earn the right to challenge Oracle Team USA for
the America’s Cup, sailing’s most prestigious trophy.  The Kiwis beat  Italy ’s Luna Rossa in the first of two
scheduled races yesterday on a fog-bound  San Francisco Bay  to
take an unbeatable 7-1 lead in the best-of-13 challenger series.  It’s the fifth time in the past six editions of the
America’s Cup that two-time champion Team New Zealand will vie
for the trophy. Oracle’s 2010 victory returned the cup to the
U.S. for the first time in 15 years. The  best-of-17  title series
on San Francisco Bay is scheduled to begin Sept. 7.  “We’ve come here to win the America’s Cup, so winning the
Louis Vuitton Cup is all part of the preparation,” Team New
Zealand skipper Dean Barker said on the series website. “The
guys are extremely focused. We came short in Valencia in 2007
and we’ll give it our all now in the next few weeks to make sure
we’re as ready as can be.”  Team New Zealand led by about 200 meters (650 feet) after
the first mark and by 700 meters as it headed through gate two
yesterday. By the time the Italian team reached the third gate,
near the Golden Gate Bridge, it trailed by 2 kilometers and
almost three minutes.  The Kiwis passed gate four and zipped downwind to complete
the 10.3 nautical mile course in 33 minutes, 49 seconds, 3:20
faster than Luna Rossa. Team New Zealand averaged 21.3 knots (24
mph) and reached a top speed of 41.2 knots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
