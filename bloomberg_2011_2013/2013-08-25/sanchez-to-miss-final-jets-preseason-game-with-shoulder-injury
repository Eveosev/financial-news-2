Quarterback  Mark Sanchez  will miss
the New York Jets’ final preseason game after injuring his right
shoulder in a 24-21 overtime win over the New York Giants
yesterday.  Sanchez is listed as day to day and will be sidelined for
the visit of the Philadelphia Eagles on Aug. 29, Jets spokesman
 Bruce Speight  said in an e-mail. Speight declined to reveal the
results of a scan on Sanchez’s shoulder.  Sanchez, who completed five of six passing attempts for 72
yards against the Giants, was hit by Marvin Austin with just
over five minutes left in the game at MetLife Stadium in East
Rutherford, New Jersey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
