A United Nations team of inspectors
will begin an on-site fact-finding mission tomorrow in the area
of Ghouta,  Syria , where allegations emerged last week of a mass
chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21 that killed more than 1,300
people, the UN said.  The top priority for the team of experts, led by Swedish
scientist Ake Sellstrom, will be “ascertaining the facts of
last week’s incident,” the UN press office said today in an e-mailed statement.  The UN statement reported on the outcome of UN disarmament
chief Angela Kane’s Aug. 24-25 meeting with President Bashar al-Assad’s government in Damascus on seeking Syria’s cooperation in
an “expeditious” investigation of the incident.  Assad’s government agreed to provide “necessary
cooperation,” including a
cessation of hostilities in the area to grant the team safe
passage, the UN
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
