Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding
Co. Ltd. (7003)  will form a joint venture with PensionDanmark to build
and operate power plants in northwest Europe and  North America .  Mitsui’s Danish subsidiary Burmeister & Wain Scandinavian
Contractor A/S and Denmark’s second-largest private pension fund
will invest 160 million pounds ($247 million), they said today
in a joint statement. The two plan to build a 40-megawatt
biomass plant in Lincolnshire by 2016, the companies said.  The fund expects returns that “top bond yields while at a
considerably lower risk compared to equities,” PensionDanmark
Chief Executive Officer Torben Moger Pedersen said by phone.  BWSC will build the plant and operate it for 15 years on a
fixed-price contract with the U.K. government guaranteeing
prices through its renewable obligation certificates program.
The pension fund, which manages $26 billion, bought stakes in
wind farms in the U.S. and  Denmark  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
