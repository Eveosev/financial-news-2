Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) ,  Switzerland â€™s
biggest life insurer, may say first-half profit climbed 2.2
percent after premium income increased.  Net income probably rose to 367.9 million francs ($396
million), from 360 million francs a year earlier, according to
the average  estimate  of seven  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.
The company will report earnings tomorrow at 7 a.m. local time.  Swiss Life, led by Chief Executive Officer Bruno Pfister,
announced cost cuts of much as 160 million francs in November
and plans to eliminate as many as 400 jobs in Germany and
Switzerland. The insurer also cut its targeted return on equity
to between 8 percent and 10 percent over the next three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
