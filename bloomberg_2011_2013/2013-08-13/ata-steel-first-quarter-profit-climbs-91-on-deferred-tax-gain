Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , India’s biggest
producer, was set to climb the most in more than four years in
Mumbai trading after its first-quarter profit almost doubled,
aided by a one-time deferred tax gain at its European unit.  The  shares  soared as much as 9 percent to 263 rupees, the
most since May 20, 2009, and traded at 256.65 rupees as of 9:23
a.m. local time. The surge helped pare the stock’s  decline  this
year to 40 percent, compared with a 0.8 percent drop in the
benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.  Group net income, including that of unit Tata Steel Europe
Ltd., climbed to 11.4 billion rupees ($186 million) in the three
months ended June 30 from 5.98 billion rupees a year ago, the
Mumbai-based company said yesterday in a filing. The median
profit of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 3.05
billion rupees. Sales fell 3 percent to 325.5 billion rupees.
The company had a deferred tax gain of 4.15 billion rupees,
compared with a 1.88 billion rupee expense a year ago.  “Tata Steel’s performance in  Europe  was a positive
surprise,” said Bhavesh Chauhan, a Mumbai-based analyst at
Angel broking Ltd., who has a buy rating for the stock. “The
company has said it would be able to maintain the performance
with its internal cost-saving measures.”  Higher production in Europe and India helped Tata Steel
increase sales volumes, while cost-cutting measures boosted
profitability. Tata Steel sold 3.14 million tons of the alloy in
the last quarter in Europe, which accounts for two-thirds of its
output, compared with 3.21 million tons a year earlier. Group
shipments rose 7 percent to 6.1 million tons.  ‘Encouraging Signs’  “There have recently been encouraging signs of improving
economic conditions in some European economies, the U.K. in
particular,” Karl-Ulrich Koehler, chief executive officer of
the Tata Steel Europe said in the statement. “We are poised to
capitalize should these translate more strongly into increased
demand from steel-intensive sectors.”  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, a measure of operational profitability, rose 4.9
percent to 37.6 billion rupees. That was 11.4 percent of revenue,
compared with 10.6 percent a year ago, according to the
statement. The company saved 3.8 billion rupees in costs last
quarter, Koushik Chatterjee, chief financial officer, said in an
conference call with analysts yesterday. The tax gain came from
the company’s operations in the Netherlands, he said.  Total expenses fell 3.8 percent to 305.2 billion rupees in
the quarter, while raw material expenses dropped 9.9 percent to
104.4 billion rupees, the company said.  Net debt at the steelmaker, part of  India ’s biggest
business group, was 612.9 billion rupees as of June 30, the
company said in a statement. The company had 101.8 billion
rupees of cash as of that date, it said.  Tata Steel has expressed interest in Stemcor Holdings
Ltd.’s India assets, which comprise a 5 million-ton-a-year iron
ore pellet plant and a mine with reserves of 100 million tons of
the steelmaking raw material in Odisha, Chatterjee said. The
assets are “next door” to a 6 million ton-a-year factory Tata
Steel is building in the state, he said. Other suitors for the
assets are rivals  JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL)  and Jindal Steel Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
