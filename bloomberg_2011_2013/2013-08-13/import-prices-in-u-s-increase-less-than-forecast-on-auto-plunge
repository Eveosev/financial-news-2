The  cost of goods  imported into the
U.S. rose less than forecast in July, reflecting the biggest
drop in automobile import prices in more than 20 years.  The 0.2 percent increase in the import-price index followed
a revised 0.4 percent drop the prior month that was more than
initially reported, according to Labor Department figures
released today in Washington.  Companies held back by sluggish global demand may be forced
to refrain from raising prices absent a stronger pickup in
inflation. Federal Reserve policy makers project the U.S.
expansion will continue to accelerate, even as price increases
remain below the central bank’s 2 percent goal.  The median estimate in a survey of 41 economists called for
a gain of 0.8 percent in July from the previous month.
Projections ranged from a decrease of 0.1 percent to a jump of
1.5 percent.  The value of imported automobiles, parts and engines fell
0.5 percent from the prior month, the most since a 1.1 percent
decline in December 1992.  Import prices rose 1 percent in July from the same month in
2012.  The cost of imported petroleum rose 3.2 percent in July
from the prior month. Excluding fuels, import prices dropped 0.4
percent last month from June, and were down 1 percent from July
2012.  The price of U.S. exports fell 0.1 percent in July,
matching the previous month’s decline.  The import-price index is the first of three monthly price
gauges from the Labor Department. Producer prices are due
tomorrow and the consumer-price index on Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
