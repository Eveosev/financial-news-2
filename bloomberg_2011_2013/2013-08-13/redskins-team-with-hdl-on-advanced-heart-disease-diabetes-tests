The  Washington Redskins  have become
the first National Football League team to provide advanced
testing for players and coaches to determine if they have a
genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease or diabetes.  The Redskins have partnered with  Health Diagnostic
Laboratory, Inc. , giving their players and staff access to the
Richmond, Virginia-based company’s advanced cardiometabolic
testing and clinical health consulting.  As part of the one-year agreement, HDL will have branding
elements such as signs or banners within the Redskins’ stadium,
FedEx Field in Landover,  Maryland , as well as at the team’s
training camp in Richmond. HDL will be a presenting sponsor of
Diabetes Awareness Day during a Nov. 3 game at FedEx Field
between the Redskins and San Diego Chargers. The Redskins and
HDL didn’t disclose financial terms of the agreement.  “We’re able to let our players and coaches know what risks
they might be facing in the future,” Redskins General Manager
Bruce Allen said yesterday in a telephone interview. “If we can
educate and motivate people for a healthier lifestyle today,
we’re going to ensure a better tomorrow for them.”  HDL this summer performed a comprehensive blood panel on
the team’s players and staff that looked at biomarkers beyond
cholesterol, such as lipid particle size, inflammation, stress,
diabetes risk and genetics.  “What we’ve been doing in the past, we looked at
cholesterol and tried to find risks for  heart disease , and we
looked at blood sugar for risks for diabetes,” HDL Chief
Medical Officer Tara Dall said by phone. “Those markers
commonly don’t pick up on those who are at greatest risk. There
are so much better technologies to understand what somebody’s
future is for heart disease and diabetes.”  Not Immune  Dall said it’s critical for professional athletes to
realize that, even though they’re in top physical shape, they’re
not immune to the risks of diabetes and heart disease due to
genes and lifestyle.  “If we can understand that and intervene with a healthy
lifestyle and addressing genetic risks, it will make a big
difference,” Dall added.  Redskins team doctor Tony Casolaro said the screenings by
HDL simply “add another level of investigation” to the NFL’s
comprehensive medical plan. He said the results are kept private
between the players and the team’s medical staff.  “The goal is to sit down with the players, particularly
those with some additional risk and say, ‘Hey it looks like you
may have some genetic predisposition to diabetes and
cardiovascular disease,”’ Casolaro said. “‘While you may be 25
years old, let’s talk about what we can do now so that in 20
years we’re not looking backwards and saying we should have done
something. It does resonate with them when you talk about
looking down the road.”  ‘Greater Jeopardy’  Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins, a fourth-round draft
pick in 2012, said the opportunity for players to receive
increased levels of medical testing off the football field is as
important as getting extra coaching on it.  “If anything I want to be informed,” Cousins said in a
telephone interview. “If I’m doing something wrong, I’m going
to continue to do it wrong. For me, I want HDL testing to tell
me that my lifestyle or something I’m doing is setting me back.
While that information could put you in jeopardy, you’re in
greater jeopardy if you’re never told.”  The Redskins have had a dietitian and a nutritionist on
their staff and Allen said the partnership with HDL is a natural
extension for players focused on staying healthy.  “Today’s players are looking for better ways for a healthy
lifestyle in order to extend their playing career or after their
career is over,” Allen said. “Today’s athlete is more educated
than ever before and it’s thanks to advances in medical
science.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
