Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon expressed concern over the security situation in Sinai
after a rocket fired last night from the Egyptian territory was
intercepted over the southern resort city of Eilat.  “We certainly respect  Egypt ’s sovereignty and are
monitoring the activities of the Egyptian army and security
forces trying to remove the nests of terrorists there,” Ya’alon
said today, according to an e-mailed statement from the
ministry. “But as you can see, last night one of these groups
was able to fire a rocket to Eilat, and I hope we can restore
calm to the south as soon as possible.”  The rocket was intercepted in flight by  Israel ’s Iron Dome
missile defense system, the army said. An Iron Dome battery was
moved down to Eilat last month due to the deteriorating security
situation in Sinai, Ya’alon said.  An Islamic group called Shura Council of al-Mujahidin in
 Jerusalem  claimed credit on its website for firing the rocket.
Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, another Jihadist group that last week said
four of its members were killed by an Israeli drone strike on
Sinai, also claimed credit for last night’s attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
