The Chicago Park District, which
owns more than 8,100 acres of green space, plans to sell $163
million of tax-exempt debt as soon as Aug. 15 in the first
general-obligation bond sale from an issuer in the city since
its rating was cut last month.  Moody’s Investors Service on July 17 cut Chicago’s rating
three levels to A3 from Aa3. A week later, the park district had
its rank dropped two levels to A1 from Aa2, with Moody’s citing
the district’s ties to the city and its debt and pension
obligations. A1 is the fifth-highest grade.  Chicago’s downgrade occurred the day before  Detroit  filed
the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy, causing investors to draw
comparisons between the two localities. Chicago trailed only
Detroit in the rate of population decline from 2000 to 2010
among the 20 largest U.S. cities. The Illinois city, third-most-populous in the nation, also faces an annual pension obligation
that would jump from $467 million in 2014 to $1.2 billion a year
later if lawmakers don’t restructure the system.  “Chicago’s pension deficit is undoubtedly a cause for
concern,” Citigroup Inc. municipal strategists including  George Friedlander  wrote in a report last week. “However, we believe
there are some bright spots on the horizon,” such as its
sizable tax base and flexibility to raise taxes.  The district’s bonds are backed by its unlimited and
limited taxing powers. About $50 million will finance building
and improving parks. The remaining $113 million will refund
outstanding securities, according to offering documents.  The district, established in 1934, has 580 parks. Its
properties also include  Soldier Field , home to the  National
Football League ’s Bears, and Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens,
though they are privately managed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
