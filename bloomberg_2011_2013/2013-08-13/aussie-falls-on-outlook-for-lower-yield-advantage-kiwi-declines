Australia ’s dollar fell for a second
day before U.S. data that may show retail sales climbed, adding
to the case for the Federal Reserve to taper monetary stimulus
that tends to weaken the greenback.  The Aussie slid against 14 of its 16 major peers ahead of a
private report on domestic business confidence that may affect
the outlook for the Reserve Bank of Australia’s monetary policy.
New Zealand’s dollar declined for a second day after completing
its biggest weekly climb since 2011.  “The interest-rate differential of Australia and the rest
of the world is narrowing as the RBA eases rates and as rates
move higher in economies such as the United States,” said
Andrew Salter, a currency strategist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Sydney. “We think it’s going to
depreciate” in the medium term, he said of the Aussie.  Australia’s currency lost 0.4 percent to 91.14 U.S. cents
as of 10:07 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday. The kiwi dollar
dropped 0.5 percent to 79.76 U.S. cents. It posted a 2.6 percent
weekly gain on Aug. 9, the most since December 2011.  “The New Zealand dollar has been outperforming for so long
that it’s just probably giving back a bit of that,” ANZ’s
Salter said.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate reached 3.43 percent, the
highest level since August 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
