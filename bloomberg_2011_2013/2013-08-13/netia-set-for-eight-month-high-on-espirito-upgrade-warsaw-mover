Netia SA, Poland’s second-largest
fixed-line phone company, climbed to an eight-month high as
Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento SA raised its price-estimate on the outlook for earnings.  The  stock  advanced 1 percent to 5.01 zloty, the highest
since Dec. 20, by the close in Warsaw. Netia has jumped 17
percent  this year  compared with a 27 percent drop in the WIG
Telecom Index. Espirito increased its price target to 5.8 zloty
from 5.4 zloty while maintaining a buy recommendation.  The Warsaw-based company lifted its 2013 forecast for
adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, to 550 million zloty ($175 million)
from 525 million zloty on “fixed cost savings and an average
revenue per user ahead of plan,” it said in a filing on Aug. 8.  “Netia’s strategy of focusing on the quality and not
quantity of its client base has started to pay off,” Konrad Ksiezopolski, an analyst at Espirito in Warsaw, wrote in a
report yesterday.  The company’s dividend yield for 2014 will probably be a
“robust” 8.4 percent, compared with 5.3 percent for European
Union peers, according to Espirito.  “Netia should be treated as an attractive dividend play in
the European Union telecommunications space,” Ksiezopolski said
in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
