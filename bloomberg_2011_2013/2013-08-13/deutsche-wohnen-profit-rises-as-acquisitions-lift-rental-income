Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI) ,  Germany ’s
second-largest residential landlord by market value, said first-half profit gained 85 percent as acquisitions lifted rental
income. The company raised its 2013 earnings forecast.  Funds from operations excluding divestments, a measure of a
property company’s ability to generate cash, rose to 60.6
million euros ($80.6 million) from 32.8 million euros a year
earlier, Deutsche Wohnen said in a statement today. The Berlin-based company said it expects FFO of 110 million euros this
year, up from an earlier forecast of 100 million euros.  Deutsche Wohnen bought about 32,000 apartments in 2012, the
most in its history, and in the first half of this year added
10,700, according to the statement. The company now owns 91,000
homes in German cities including Berlin and  Frankfurt .  “With these acquisitions we have strengthened our core and
growth regions and can generate economies of scale through our
operational platform,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Zahn
said in the statement.  Deutsche Wohnen rose as much as 4.5 percent in Frankfurt
trading, the biggest gain since May 14, and was up 2.4 percent
at 14.17 euros at 12:08 p.m. The shares have climbed about 1.4
percent this year, extending last year’s 38 percent advance and
increasing the company’s market value to 2.4 billion euros.  Net income increased to 50.2 million euros, or 31 cents a
share, from 36.9 million euros, or 35 cents, a year earlier.
Profit from Deutsche Wohnen’s main business of renting
apartments rose to 139.3 million euros from 86.6 million euros.  Higher Rents  Deutsche Wohnen has been buying apartments to take
advantage of rising German rents and its ability to raise
capital on the stock market at favorable terms. The company
raised its average rent to 5.81 euros per square meter from 5.67
euros a year ago, according to the statement.  Average rents for homes in Berlin, Deutsche Wohnen’s
biggest market, rose 6.3 percent in the past two years, the
city’s government said in a May report.  To finance its acquisitions, Deutsche Wohnen issued about
195 million euros of new shares in the first half.  Acquisition Pace  The company has as much as 150 million euros available to
make further acquisitions, Chief Financial Officer Lars Wittan
said on a conference call with analysts and reporters.  “We are quite optimistic we can achieve another 1,000”
apartment acquisitions in 2013, CEO Zahn said on the call.  Zahn wouldn’t say whether Deutsche Wohnen plans to bid for
 GSW Immobilien AG (GIB) , a German competitor that owns about 60,000
apartments in Berlin and which lost its chairman and its CEO in
June following investor complaints.  “There has been a lot of talk about consolidation,” Zahn
said. “We are selective on acquisitions and we have to be
focused on integration, but indeed we closely monitor the
market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
