Japanese  government bonds  advanced,
pushing benchmark 10-year yields to a three-month low, after an
auction of five-year notes drew the highest demand on record.  Lead bond futures rallied to the highest since May as the
 bid-to-cover  ratio at today’s sale rose to 5.514 times,
exceeding the level of 5.506 reached in October that was the
highest since government began issuing the debt in 2000. Data
showed machine orders fell in June, a day after a report
revealed the economy grew less than economists forecast. Minutes
of the Bank of  Japan ’s July meeting released today showed policy
makers expected the economy to recover moderately.  “I’m surprised how strong the five-year auction was,”
said  Tetsuya Miura , the chief bond strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co., one of the 23 primary dealers obliged to bid at
Japan’s debt auctions. “Five-year notes were underperforming
other maturities. The demand-supply picture may change.”  Japan’s 10-year yields slid 1 1/2 basis points, or 0.015
percentage point, to 0.73 percent, at 2:20 p.m. in Tokyo,
according to Japan Bond Trading Co. That was the  least  since May
13. The price of the 0.8 percent note due June 2023 added 0.139
yen to 100.643 yen. The five-year yield fell one basis point to
0.275 percent, matching the lowest since July 24.  Ten-year bond futures for September delivery reached 144.24
in  Tokyo , the most since May 10, before trading at 144.16.  Machine orders  declined 2.7 percent in June from the
previous month, when they climbed 10.5 percent, data released
today by the Cabinet Office showed. It said yesterday  gross
domestic product  expanded an annualized 2.6 percent in the
second quarter, compared with forecasts for 3.6 percent growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
