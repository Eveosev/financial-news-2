Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver
Plaxico Burress will miss the National Football League season
after injuring his shoulder in a preseason practice.  Burress was placed on the team’s injured/reserve list
today, a day after having shoulder surgery on his 36th birthday.  Burress played three games last season with the Steelers,
who lost leading receiver  Mike Wallace  as a free agent this
offseason. Burress, who spent the 2011 NFL season with the  New
York  Jets, was out of football in 2009 and 2010, when he served
20 months in jail on a weapons charge after shooting himself in
the leg while a member of the  New York Giants .  Having played his first five seasons in Pittsburgh before a
four-year stint with the Giants, the 6-foot-5 Burress has 553
receptions for 8,499 yards and 64 touchdowns for his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
