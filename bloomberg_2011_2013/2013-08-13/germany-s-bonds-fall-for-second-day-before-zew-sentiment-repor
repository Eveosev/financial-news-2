Germany ’s  government bonds  fell,
underperforming all their euro-region peers, after a survey
showing investor confidence in the nation increased this month
reduced demand for the region’s safest assets.  German sovereign debt  of all maturities declined, pushing
10-year yields to the highest level in seven weeks before the
government sells 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion) of the
securities tomorrow. French, Dutch, Finnish and Austrian bonds
also slid before a report that economists said will show the
euro area returned to growth last quarter. The extra yield
investors demand to hold Italian and Spanish 10-year debt
instead of German bunds shrank to the narrowest since 2011.  “We are underweight on German bunds as we have a negative
outlook for the asset over the next three to six months,” said
Willem Sels, U.K. head of investment strategy at  HSBC Private
Bank  in London. “The German economy is moving in the right
direction. On the periphery, the news is generally positive.
That tightens credit spreads and possibly puts upward pressure
on bund yields as well.”  The benchmark 10-year bund yield jumped 11 basis points, or
0.11 percentage point, to 1.81 percent at 4:28 p.m. London time,
the  highest  since June 25. The 1.5 percent security due in May
2023 dropped 0.985, or 9.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
97.215.  Germany’s  30-year yields  climbed as much as nine basis
points to 2.60 percent, the most since March 2012, two-year
rates climbed six basis points to 0.23 percent.  ‘Upside Surprise’  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research said its
 index  of German investor and analyst expectations climbed to 42
from 36.3 in July.  Gross domestic product  in the euro area rose
0.2 percent in the three months through June, ending six
quarters of contraction, a Bloomberg News survey showed before
the data is released tomorrow.  “There’s a decent upside surprise on the confidence data,
it’s a strong report and what that means is more pressure on
bunds,” said  Michael Leister , a senior fixed-income strategist
at Commerzbank AG in London. “We’ve had a decent run of macro
data over the past few weeks and sentiment has improved.”  Volatility on German government bonds was the highest in
euro-area markets, followed by those of France and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  France, Finland  French 10-year yields increased 10 basis points to 2.35
percent, while similar-maturity Dutch rates also climbed 10
basis points, to 2.17 percent. Finnish rates also rose 10 basis
points, to 2.05 percent.  Italian and Spanish bonds outperformed as optimism that
growth is returning to the region underpinned demand for higher-yielding assets.  Italy ’s  10-year yield  added six basis points to 4.23
percent, while  Spain ’s rose one basis point to 4.49 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italy’s 10-year
securities instead of German bunds shrank five basis points to
242 basis points after reaching 237, the narrowest since July
2011. The spread widened to a euro-era record of 575 basis
points on Nov. 9, 2011.  Spain’s yield spread over German bunds contracted 10 basis
points to 268 basis points after reaching 265 basis points, the
least since August 2011. The difference surged to 650 in July
2012 amid speculation the country would need to seek a bailout.  “We’ve had pretty good data from  Europe ,” said Owen Callan, an analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Dublin. “Italian and
Spanish GDP was better, the general macro picture has improved.
Periphery government bonds are performing well,” he said,
referring to the securities of Europe’s high debt and deficit
nations.  Germany last sold 10-year bonds on July 17 at an average
yield of 1.57 percent, compared with 1.55 percent at a previous
auction on June 19.  German bonds lost investors 1.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy’s
securities returned 4.4 percent and Spain’s rose 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
