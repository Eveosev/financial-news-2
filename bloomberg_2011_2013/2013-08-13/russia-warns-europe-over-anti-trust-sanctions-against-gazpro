Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that if the European Union imposes anti-trust
sanctions against  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , this will make it hard for the
gas export monopoly to work in the EU.  “If sanctions are adopted against Gazprom, it will be
difficult for the company to operate in markets where it faces
open discrimination,” Lavrov said in an article posted on the
Foreign Ministry’s website. Russia is “concerned” about the
anti-trust inquiry that began last year, he said in the article
published in the annual Journal of Common Market Studies.  Russian President Vladimir Putin in September warned the
EU, which relies on Russia for a quarter of its gas needs, that
there would be “losses on both sides” if the issue isn’t
resolved. He accused the 28-nation bloc of trying to shift
responsibility for subsidizing former communist EU members onto
 Russia  by forcing Gazprom to cut prices for customers in eastern
and central Europe.  Gazprom, the world’s largest gas exporter, faces a
potential $14.5 billion penalty as companies found to violate EU
competition rules can be fined as much as 10 percent of annual
revenue. The European Commission is investigating whether
Gazprom imposed unfair prices by linking gas and oil prices,
preventing gas trading between countries and hindering the
diversification of supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
