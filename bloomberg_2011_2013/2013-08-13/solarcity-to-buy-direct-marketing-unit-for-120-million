SolarCity Corp. (SCTY)  agreed to buy a
solar direct-marketing company majority-owned by Guthy-Renker
LLC for about $120 million in stock and cash to reach more
customers.  Paramount Energy Solutions LLC has about 150 employees in
Sacramento, California, SolarCity Chief Executive Officer  Lyndon Rive  said in a phone interview today. Guthy-Renker CEO Ben Van de Bunt is expected to join SolarCity’s board later this year
and Haynes Barnard, CEO of Paramount Equity, will join SolarCity
as chief revenue officer.  The acquisition will help  San Mateo , California-based
SolarCity reduce costs associated with finding new customers for
its rooftop solar systems and meet a goal of reaching 1 million
customers, or 6,000 megawatts installed, by July 4, 2018, Rive
said. SolarCity increased its 2013 guidance to 278 megawatts to
account for the acquisition.  “We’re highly confident we can meet that goal with this
marketing team,” Rive said. “You need a comprehensive
marketing package and they have some of the lowest costs in the
solar industry.”  The transaction will be paid for using $116.3 million in
SolarCity shares and the remainder in cash. Guthy-Renker is the
company behind the acne treatment Proactiv Solution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
