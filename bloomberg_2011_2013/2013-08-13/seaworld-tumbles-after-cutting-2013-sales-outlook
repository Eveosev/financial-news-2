SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) , the
operator of theme parks featuring killer whales, fell as much as
14 percent after cutting its forecast for 2013 sales as
attendance fell in the second quarter.  The stock dropped as low as $31.40 in extended trading
yesterday after declining 0.4 percent to $36.31 at the close in
 New York . The company went public in April at $27 a share.  SeaWorld, controlled by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , forecast full-year revenue of $1.45 billion to $1.48 billion, according to a
statement yesterday. In May, it projected sales of $1.46 billion
to $1.49 billion. Analysts on average had estimated $1.5 billion
for the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  SeaWorld, which operates 11 parks, said attendance fell 9
percent to about 6.6 million guests in the second quarter, from
a year earlier, in part because it raised ticket prices and the
Easter holiday fell in the previous quarter. The company, which
opened its Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin attraction in
 Orlando  in May, has increased investment under Blackstone,
adding 11 attractions last year.  Visitors in  Florida  and  Virginia  were also discouraged by
heavier than usual rainfall, Chief Executive Officer Jim Atchison said in a conference call with investors.  “We’ve dealt with different weather patterns before,”
Atchison said. “The fundamentals of our business we’re quite
pleased with and are very strong.”  Lower Attendance  Sales for the three months ending in June fell 3.4 percent
to $411.3 million, reflecting the lower park attendance.
Analysts had forecast $436.7 million. Profit of 41 cents a
share, excluding items, exceeded the 39-cent average of nine
analysts’ estimates.  The company, based in Orlando, Florida, said higher ticket
prices and increased spending by guests at parks helped boost
revenue per visitor by 7 percent in the quarter.  SeaWorld is the focus of a critical documentary now in
theaters called  “Blackfish,”  which chronicles the life of a
killer whale. Fred Jacobs, a spokesman for the company, said
visitor attendance and its sales forecast were unaffected by the
film.  The company’s forecast for full-year profit, measured as
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, was unchanged at $430 million to $440 million.  Blackstone, the world’s largest private-equity firm, bought
SeaWorld from  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  in 2009 and has a 63
percent stake in the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
