The rupiah reached a four-year low
on rising speculation the U.S. will pare stimulus at a time when
 Indonesia ’s current-account deficit is worsening.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index climbed for a second day
before a report that may show U.S. retail sales increased for a
fourth month in July, while data on manufacturing and housing
starts later in the week are also forecast to improve. The
nation’s current-account shortfall may be a record $9 billion in
the second quarter, from $5.3 billion in the previous three
months, central bank Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo said Aug. 2.  “There is increased concern that the  Federal Reserve  will
go ahead with its tapering plans,” said Rully Nova, an analyst
at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “The uncertainty
will prompt more outflows from emerging-market currencies,
especially the rupiah with its widening deficit.”  The rupiah fell as much as 0.1 percent to 10,298 per dollar,
the weakest level since July 2009, and was little changed at
10,294 as of 9:51 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from
local banks. The spot traded at a 1.5 percent premium to one-month non-deliverable forwards, which fell 0.3 percent to 10,450,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A  fixing  by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  used to
settle the derivative contracts was set at 10,288 yesterday.
Local markets were closed last week for Eid al-Fitr holidays.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 22 basis points,
or 0.22 percentage point, to 11.58 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on  government bonds  due May 2023 climbed two
basis points to 7.75 percent, the highest level since July 31,
data from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  Four Federal Reserve officials indicated greater
willingness last week to begin tapering the central bank’s bond-buying program that’s driven demand for emerging-market assets.
Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans  said last week he wouldn’t
rule out a decision to start scaling back asset purchases at the
Sept. 17-18 gathering of the  Federal Open Market Committee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
