China Merchants Bank Co. (3968)  may give
terms of a 35 billion-yuan ($5.7 billion) share sale on Aug. 16
when it publishes earnings, Apple Daily reported today, as the
lender prepares this year’s second-largest equity offering.  The bank will offer 1.74 shares for every 10 existing
 shares , for at least 9.29 yuan each in  Shanghai  and HK$11.77 in
Hong Kong, the Chinese-language newspaper reported, citing
unidentified people. Zhang Fan, a Shenzhen-based press officer
at the bank, declined to comment on what she called market
speculation.  China ’s sixth-largest lender by assets, which postponed the
sale twice because of delays in approval, needs to strengthen
its capital buffer after regulators tightened requirements and
as policy makers crack down on banks’ use of short-term
financing. It won approval from the China Securities Regulatory
Commission on July 23 for the Shanghai portion of the offer.  “Investors will be relieved to see Merchants’ capital
overhang finally addressed,” Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., wrote in a note today,
upgrading the shares to neutral from underperform. “This name
could rally over the next few months” if the bank reports
strong second-quarter earnings.  China Merchants shares  rose 7.2 percent to HK$14.24 at 2:49
p.m. in Hong Kong, their biggest intraday gain since December
2011. The stock gained 0.9 percent to 11.15  yuan  in Shanghai.  Merchants Bank’s capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.41
percent as of March 31 under new capital requirements that took
effect at the beginning of this year, with a core Tier 1 ratio
of 8.6 percent. While both measurements are higher than the
minimum regulatory requirement, they are the second-lowest among
nine Hong Kong-listed Chinese lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
