The  Swiss franc  slid to the weakest
in a month against the euro after a report showed the 17-nation
region pulled out of recession last quarter, damping demand for
the safety of the Swiss currency.  The Bloomberg U.S.  Dollar Index  fell from a one-week high
as wholesale prices unexpectedly were little changed in July.
The franc dropped versus most of its 16 major counterparts after
German and French gross domestic product also exceeded analysts
forecasts. The pound advanced for a fourth day against the euro
after a report showed U.K. jobless claims dropped more in July
than economists forecast.  New Zealand ’s dollar strengthened by
the most in a week after retail sales jumped.  “The euro-swiss move is one of modest improvement in the
fundamentals in  Europe ,” said  Mike Moran , a senior currency
strategist at Standard Chartered in  New York . “We’re also
starting to see foreign depositors, which have sought stability
in Swiss-denominated assets, start to pare down some of those
allocations.”  The franc dropped 0.2 percent to 1.23995 per euro as of 5
p.m. in New York after depreciating to 1.24269, the weakest
level since July 11.  Switzerland ’s currency declined for a
fourth day against the dollar, sliding 0.3 percent to 93.55
centimes per dollar.  The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.3255 and to 130.08 yen. The
yen rose 0.1 percent to 98.14 per dollar.  Shekel, Kiwi  The Israeli shekel decreased against most of its major
peers after the  Bank of Israel , which is awaiting the nomination
of a new governor, bought dollars to curb a rally. The currency
depreciated 0.4 percent to 3.5705 per dollar after earlier
falling 0.7 percent, the most since July 30.  New Zealand’s dollar gained versus its 31 most-traded
counterparts after core retail sales in the country jumped in
the second quarter, stoking speculation the central bank will
raise borrowing costs. The kiwi increased 0.8 percent to 80.28
U.S. cents.  Malaysia’s ringgit declined versus the majority of its 31
most-traded counterparts even as palm-oil output in the country
surged by the most in 10 months in July. The currency dropped
0.4 percent to 3.2735 per dollar after declining to 3.2770, the
weakest closing price since June 2010.  Ringgit Interest  Dollar-ringgit was the fifth-most traded pair in the over-the-counter foreign-exchange options market, changing hands at
1,600 percent more than average for the past five Wednesdays at
a similar time in the day.  Options on the dollar-ringgit rate totaled $2.3 billion, or
9 percent of the $25 billion total. That compared with $27
billion traded yesterday, according to data reported by U.S.
banks to the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. and tracked by
Bloomberg.  “Dollar-ringgit has started to attract more interest,”
 Standard Chartered ’s Moran said. “I would relate the options
activity to a building consensus on weakening fundamentals. This
could start to be a breakout trade for a lot of investors
looking for opportunities in  Asia .”  Volume in options on the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted
to $3.7 billion, the largest share of trades at 15 percent,
trading at 45 percent less than average. Euro-dollar trading
amounted to $3.2 billion, a 13 percent share, and down 21
percent on average.  Economic Expansion  GDP in the 17-nation  euro area  expanded 0.3 percent in the
second quarter after a 0.3 percent contraction in the previous
three months, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said. German GDP increased 0.7 percent, more than the
0.6 percent gain forecast by economists, while  France ’s expanded
0.5 percent following two quarters of contraction.  Investors should sell the franc with a target of 1.35 per
euro by the middle of 2014, according to Societe Generale SA.  “We definitely have a bias for a weaker franc,” said
Kasper Kirkegaard, a senior currency strategist at  Danske Bank
A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “If some of the money that has flowed into
the Swiss economy reverses, it should add pressure to the
franc.”  The franc has slumped 1.4 percent in the past week, the
worst performance among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro fell 0.6
percent, while the dollar added 0.4 percent.  Pound Gains  The pound advanced versus 15 of its 16 major counterparts
as a separate report showed Britain’s unemployment rate remained
at 7.8 percent in the second quarter amid signs that the labor
market is improving.  The  Bank of England ’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1
to link the outlook for its benchmark  interest rate  to
unemployment, according to the minutes released today of its
July 31-Aug. 1 meeting.  The pound gained 0.4 percent to 85.51 pence per euro after
appreciating to 85.28 pence, the strongest level since July 4.
The U.K. currency rose 0.3 percent to $1.5500.  The dollar weakened as the steady reading in the U.S.
producer price index followed a 0.8 percent gain in June, a
Labor Department report showed today in  Washington . The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 73 economists projected a 0.3
percent rise. The so-called core measure, which excludes
volatile food and fuel, climbed less than forecast.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index was little changed at 1,025
after climbing to 1,027.29, the highest level since Aug. 6.  Sixty-five percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg said
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will probably reduce the central
bank’s $85 billion in monthly bond purchases in September. The
Federal Open Market Committee’s first step will probably be
small, with monthly purchases tapered by $10 billion to a $75
billion pace, according to the median estimate in a survey of 48
economists conducted Aug. 9-13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
