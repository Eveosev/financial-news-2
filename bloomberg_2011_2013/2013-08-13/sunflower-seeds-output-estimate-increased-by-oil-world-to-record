Global production of sunflower
seeds, the European Union’s most common source of food oil, will
be a record in 2013-14 led by higher than anticipated output in
the EU, Oil World said.  Output will rise 13 percent to 40.2 million metric tons, up
1.5 million from the previous estimate, with the EU forecast
raised to a record 8.6 million tons from 6.9 million tons last
year, the Hamburg-based research company said in a report. The
EU will be the largest exporter in 2013-14 due to bigger crops
in Bulgaria, Hungary and  Romania , it said.  “Given the surplus of available supplies, primarily in
Bulgaria and Romania, sunseed prices will stay under
considerable pressure at the Black Sea locations in the new-crop
seasons,” Oil World said.  Sunflower-seed prices fell to a 45-month low of $375-$385 a
ton as of Aug. 8, or $75 to $90 a ton cheaper than rapeseed and
also below soybean prices, Oil World said. By yesterday,
soybeans dropped 25 percent in one year to $11.9425 a bushel
($438.77 a ton) on the Chicago Board of Trade.  The EU will use 3.3 million tons of sunflower oil for food
in 2013-14, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
 Foreign Agricultural Service . The second most popular is  palm
oil  followed by rapeseed oil.  Russia and Ukraine growers will focus more on domestic
sales of sunflower seeds, leaving their combined exports at
250,000 tons this season compared with 700,000 tons in 2011-12,
it said.  Large crops in importing countries will probably mean
stockpiles are built up, Oil World said. Import demand in  Turkey 
is estimated at 400,000 to 500,000 tons in the new season, down
from 620,000 tons in 2012-13, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
