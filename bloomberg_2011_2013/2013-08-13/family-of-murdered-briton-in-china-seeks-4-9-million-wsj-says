The family of a British businessman
murdered in  China  is seeking at least 30 million yuan ($4.9
million) in compensation for his death, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the discussions.  Representatives of the family of Neil Heywood, who was
found dead in Chongqing in 2011, have raised the issue with
Chinese authorities and the family of Gu Kailai, who was
convicted last year of murdering him, the paper said, citing
people it didn’t identify.  Gu’s husband, former Politburo member  Bo Xilai , is expected
to face trial in the coming weeks on charges of corruption as
well as abuse of power in connection with the Heywood murder
case. Heywood’s death in 2011 touched off a chain of events that
led to Bo’s ouster and sparked the biggest political upheaval in
China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.  The British embassy in Beijing has made the Chinese
authorities aware of the family’s concerns several times since
Gu’s trial, most recently twice last month, an embassy
spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman asked not to be named in
accordance with embassy policy.  Citing a lawyer close to Gu’s family, the Journal said
Heywood’s family was seeking between 30 million and 50 million
 yuan  though the legal maximum in such cases may be only 1
million yuan.  Heywood’s mother Ann said she was disappointed that Chinese
authorities hadn’t responded in a substantive way despite
“repeated approaches,” according to a  statement  given to the
Journal on Aug 11. Heywood’s children, who are 8 and 12 years
old, have no financial provision for their future, she said in
the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
