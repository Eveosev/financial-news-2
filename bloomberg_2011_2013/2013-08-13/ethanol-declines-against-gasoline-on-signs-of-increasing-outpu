Ethanol declined against gasoline as
the futures slid to a 14-month low on speculation that the
September corn harvest will allow companies to boost output of
the biofuel.  The spread between the fuels expanded 5.64 cents to 80.25
cents a gallon a day after the Agriculture Department said
domestic corn output will set a record. Ethanol for September
delivery closed at a 25.6-cent premium to the October contract
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  “The steep carry in September and October has producers
emptying tanks of any material,” said Justin Dirico, manager of
the biofuels desk at Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 1.8 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.14 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since June 22, 2012. Futures have declined 2.3
percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 3.84 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.9425 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for September delivery decreased 16.75 cents, or 3.6
percent, to $4.5525 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively
traded December contract dropped 16.75 cents to $4.4725.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 48 cents, up from 44 cents yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The government uses tracking certificates, known as
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, to determine
compliance with mandates to use the fuel.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  rose 2 cents to 72 cents, the
highest since Aug. 7, while  advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, added 1 cent to 79 cents,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol production rose 2.5 percent to 853,000 barrels a
day in the week ended Aug. 2, data from the Energy Information
Administration show. Stockpiles increased 1.6 percent to 16.7
million barrels, the highest since July 19 and 8.2 percent
higher than the record low of 15.4 million barrels in June,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s research unit.  Imports have averaged 22,000 barrels a day this year
through Aug. 2, up from 12,000 barrels daily during the same
period a year earlier.  The agency is scheduled to release the latest production
and supply figures at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  In cash market trading, ethanol climbed 8 cents to $2.48 a
gallon in New York, 4 cents to $2.49 on the West Coast, 2 cents
to $2.265 in Chicago and 2 cents to $2.365 a gallon on the  Gulf
Coast , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf widened by 2 cents
to 12.5 cents while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
expanded 6 cents to 21.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
