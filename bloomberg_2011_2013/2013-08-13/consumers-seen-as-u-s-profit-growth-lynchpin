Companies will have to depend on
increased U.S. consumer spending to meet analysts’ earnings
estimates through year-end, according to Kristen Scarpa, a
strategist at Barclays Plc’s wealth-management unit.  Profit growth at companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index will accelerate to 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter from
2.9 percent in the third quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from analysts’ projections.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows why companies will be unable to
count on two potential sources of growth -- profit margins and
overseas sales -- to meet the estimates, as Scarpa wrote in an
Aug. 9 report.  Operating profit for the  S&P 500  amounted to 13.4 percent
of sales during the past 12 months, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The margin approached a peak of 13.8 percent in the third
quarter of 2011. Companies based in the U.S. made 21 percent of
profit elsewhere in the first quarter, down from 36 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2008, according to Federal Reserve data.  “We’d bet on the U.S. consumer spurring the next phase of
U.S. corporate growth,” wrote Scarpa, based in  New York . The
strategist cited a decline in unemployment, a reduced debt
burden and rising net worth.  The jobless rate dropped to 7.4 percent in July from a high
of 10 percent in October 2009, according to data from the Labor
Department. Households’ debt declined to 10.5 percent of after-tax income in the first quarter from 14.1 percent in the third
quarter of 2007, according to the Fed, while their net worth
rose to a record $70.3 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
