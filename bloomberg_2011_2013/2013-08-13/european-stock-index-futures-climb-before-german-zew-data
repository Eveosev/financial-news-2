European stocks  gained for a fourth
day, extending a 10-week high, as companies posted better-than-estimated earnings and German investor confidence climbed.  EON SE (EOAN)  rose the most in six weeks after  Germany ’s biggest
utility posted first-half profit that exceeded analysts’
projections.  GAM Holding (GAM)  AG, a Swiss asset manager, surged the
most in four years as earnings more than tripled. Banca Monte
dei Paschi di Siena SpA led Italian banks higher as the nation’s
10-year yield premium over benchmark German bunds shrank to the
lowest in two years.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index climbed 0.6 percent to 307.79 at
the close of trading, the highest level since May 28. The gauge
gained 0.6 percent last week as  China ’s industrial output rose
more than estimated. The index has soared 10 percent in 2013,
led by automobile and financial-services companies, as central
banks around the world maintained stimulus measures.  “There’s been a bias towards companies meeting or beating
expectations,”  James Buckley , a London-based  fund manager  at
Baring Asset Management Ltd., which oversees about $50 billion,
said by telephone. “That coupled with slightly better macro
data coming out of Europe and even a lessening in fears over
Chinese data has all contributed to a bit more confidence. It’s
all produced a positive environment for European equities.”  Investor confidence in Germany, Europe’s largest economy,
rose more than forecast in August. The ZEW Center for European
Economic Research in Mannheim said its  index  of investor and
analyst expectations advanced to 42 from 36.3 in July.  Retail Sales  A report in  Washington  showed U.S.  retail sales  climbed for
a fourth consecutive month in July, increasing 0.2 percent. The
median forecast of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
called for a 0.3 percent advance.  National benchmark indexes advanced in all of the 18
western European markets today, except Greece and Iceland. The
U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  rose 0.6 percent, Germany’s DAX added 0.7
percent and  France ’s CAC 40 increased 0.5 percent.  EON rallied 2.2 percent to 12.50 euros, the biggest gain
since June 26. The company reported first-half underlying net
income of 1.91 billion euros ($2.54 billion), topping the
average analyst estimate of 1.79 billion euros.  RWE AG, the second-largest utility in Germany, increased
4.5 percent to 22.36 euros, the biggest jump in four months.  GAM Holding jumped 9.7 percent to 16.90 Swiss francs, the
largest gain since April 2009. The asset manager that split from
Julius Baer Group Ltd. almost four years ago said first-half
profit more than tripled after fee and commission income
increased.  Italy Spread  Monte Paschi surged 7.7 percent to 22.5 euro cents in
Milan. The bank is the most exposed lender in the country to
 Italy ’s sovereign debt, holding about 29 billion euros of bonds
at the end of June. Banca Popolare dell’Emilia Romagna Scrl
advanced 4 percent to 5.48 euros.  The yield premium investors demand to hold Italian and
Spanish 10-year bonds over benchmark German bunds shrank to the
lowest in two years amid speculation the euro-area economy is
edging back to growth. The Italy-Germany spread narrowed to 240
basis points and  Spain ’s yield gap over Germany slid to 268
basis points today.  Fresnillo Plc rallied 5.6 percent to 1,165 pence, for a
fifth day of gains, as UBS AG initiated coverage of the gold and
silver producer with a buy rating. Analysts led by Daniel Major
cited the company’s low costs and ability to generate free  cash
flow  even as the price of precious metals slips.  Deutsche Wohnen  Deutsche Wohnen AG climbed 1.8 percent to 14.10 euros, the
highest in more than two months. Germany’s second-largest
residential landlord by market value said first-half profit
jumped 85 percent as acquisitions increased rental income. The
company raised its earnings forecast for 2013.  Geberit AG sank 7.3 percent, the most since March 2009, to
236.30 francs. The Swiss maker of toilets and bathroom piping
said there’s been “a clear fall in demand” in most European
markets since the fourth quarter of 2012 and a continued
downturn in public construction in  North America .  “An end to this trend, or a recovery, is not in sight,”
Geberit wrote in a statement today.  Michael Page International Plc (MPI)  lost 4 percent to 450.2
pence. The U.K. recruitment company said the three months
through September will be “another challenging quarter” after
first-half gross profit fell 4.4 percent.  Schindler Holding AG (SCHP)  slid 5.2 percent to 136 francs, the
biggest decline in almost two years, after the Swiss elevator
maker cut its profit forecast.  Schindler projected net income of about 550 million francs
($589 million) to 600 million francs this year, including a 155
million-franc charge on its investment in Hyundai Elevator Co.
That compares with an earlier forecast of as much as 790 million
francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
