Iraq exported 29 percent less Kirkuk
crude than scheduled in shipping plans in the first seven months
of this year, according to data from port agent Boutros Maritime
& Transport SA and loading programs.  The Middle Eastern nation shipped an average of 218,830
barrels a day from the Turkish port of Ceyhan from January to
July, data compiled by Boutros show. This compares with 307,311
barrels a day based on monthly loading plans.  Shipments from Kirkuk to Ceyhan have repeatedly halted this
year because of sabotage and technical faults. Exports of the
blend are near five-year lows in July at about 190,000 barrels a
day, including 14,000 barrels to  Jordan , the  International
Energy Agency  said in its monthly Oil Market Report on Aug. 9.  “Persistent militant attacks on the Kirkuk pipeline
running to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan have undermined
export flows since a 2013 high of 345,000 barrels a day,” the
IEA said. “The suspension of exports from the Kurdistan region
to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan crude pipeline, which is controlled by the
central government in  Baghdad , accounts for around 100,000
barrels a day of the export shortfall.”  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
