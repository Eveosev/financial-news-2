Burlington Northern  Santa Fe  LLC
issued $1.5 billion in a two-part bond sale, its first offering
in five months.  The railroad that  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) 
bought in 2010 sold $800 million of 3.85 percent, 10-year notes
that yield 117 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $700 million of 5.15 percent, 30-year securities
at 140 basis points more than benchmarks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Fort Worth, Texas-based company’s bonds may be rated A3
by Moody’s Investors Service, the data show. Proceeds from the
sale will be used for general corporate purposes, which may
include capital expenditures and debt repayment, the company
said in a regulatory filing today.  BNSF raised $1.5 billion in March with a sale that included
$700 million of 3 percent notes maturing in 2023. Those
debentures traded at 95.2 cents on the dollar to yield 3.6
percent on Aug. 9, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. managed today’s sale, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
