EON SE reported a 42 percent drop in
first-half profit as lower power prices forced  Germany ’s biggest
utility to keep plants idle.  Underlying net income, the measure EON uses to calculate
its dividend, fell to 1.91 billion euros ($2.54 billion) from
3.3 billion euros a year earlier, the Dusseldorf-based company
said today in a statement. That beat the 1.79 billion-euro
average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
dropped 1.2 percent to 64.6 billion euros.  “EON’s power generation business in Europe is suffering
from low capacity utilization and low wholesale prices as a
result of Europe’s economic crisis and interventionist energy
policies and regulations,” the company said in the statement.  German utilities are contending with lower demand, power
prices near record lows and market rules that support wind and
solar power. EON, which last year scrapped profit forecasts for
2013, today kept its revised target for underlying net income of
2.2 billion euros to 2.6 billion euros.  The company, expanding abroad as it considers plant
shutdowns at home, plans to reduce capital spending and is
selling assets to cut costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
