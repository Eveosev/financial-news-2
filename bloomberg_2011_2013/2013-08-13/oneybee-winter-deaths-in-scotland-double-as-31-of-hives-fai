Honeybee winter losses in  Scotland 
almost doubled this year, with 31 percent of managed hives
failing, up from 16 percent the previous winter, according to a
survey of beekeepers run by the University of Strathclyde.  Colony losses in the 2012-13 winter were 156 out of a total
498 colonies managed by beekeepers, according to survey results
 published  online today. The loss rate is the highest since
surveys began in 2006, according to the university.  The losses match those in  England , where a third of
honeybee colonies perished this past winter, double the previous
year, according to data from the British Beekeepers Association.
European beekeepers have been reporting unusual colony losses
for the past 10 to 15 years, according to the European Food
Safety Authority.  “The loss rate in Scotland is amongst the highest in
 Europe  this year, while similarly high losses have been reported
recently from England and  Wales ,” Alison Gray, a lecturer at
the University of Strathclyde, was cited as saying in the
statement.  Of 20 wild honeybee colonies in Scotland known to be alive
in September, 11 died over winter, according to data from the
university. That’s the worst survival rate since monitoring of
feral colonies started five years ago, according to Magnus
Peterson at the university, who’s been collecting the data.  “The difficult weather conditions are a particular problem
in Scotland, with severe winters followed by long wet springs
being a problem, especially if it comes after a poor wet summer
as in this last year,” Gray said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
