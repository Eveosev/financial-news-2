A top ally of Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said European policy makers should “forget about”
another sovereign debt writedown for Greece, warning that other
countries would line up to seek a similar solution.  Volker Kauder , the parliamentary caucus leader of Merkel’s
Christian Democratic-led bloc, reiterated the government’s
position that it opposes a Greek writedown. Indebted euro-area
nations should focus instead on reforms to boost their
competitiveness and overcome the debt crisis.  “I don’t foresee a debt writedown for Greece whatsoever,”
Kauder said in an interview today in Berlin. “Even a discussion
about this paralyzes the reform efforts in these countries.”  Merkel has avoided discussion about further bailout
measures for Greece as she seeks re-election on Sept. 22, saying
that any decision on Greece will be taken next year.  Der Spiegel 
magazine this week cited a Bundesbank document concluding that
international creditors must come up with a new Greek rescue
package by the beginning of 2014 at the latest.  Kauder also took aim at U.S. monetary policy, saying such
measures as quantitative easing shouldn’t be adopted by the 17-nation euro area, where it could spur inflation.  “In  Europe  this would necessarily lead to higher
inflation,” Kauder said. The U.S., in contrast, “has the
advantage that they have  China  as a recipient of their
dollars.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
