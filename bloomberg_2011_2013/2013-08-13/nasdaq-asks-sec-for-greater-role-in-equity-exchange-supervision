Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc. asked federal
regulators to approve a broader oversight role for the second-largest equity-exchange operator, expanding its supervision of
potential market manipulation.  The request to take on some of the policing duties now
handled by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the
brokerage industry watchdog organization, was made in an Aug. 12
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Nasdaq’s request to tweak its responsibilities as a self-regulatory organization comes the same month that Wall Street
firms asked the SEC to consider stripping public exchanges of
their SRO designation. The proposed change would give Nasdaq
greater leeway to look for market manipulation, particularly at
the open and close of the trading day.  “Nasdaq believes that its expertise in its own market
structure coupled with its continued monitoring of these
activities in real-time will enable it to enhance existing
patterns to better detect improper activity on its market,”
wrote the exchange in an  SEC filing .  Nasdaq said it will take on oversight for real-time
monitoring of compliance by market makers who are also part of
any underwriting syndicates. Finra will continue to watch for
activities that take place across U.S. stock markets, said
Nasdaq, and deal with suspected infractions.  “Nasdaq will continue to refer potentially violative
conduct to Finra for further review,” wrote the exchange.
“Moreover, Finra will continue to perform the vast majority of
surveillance activity for Nasdaq’s equities markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
