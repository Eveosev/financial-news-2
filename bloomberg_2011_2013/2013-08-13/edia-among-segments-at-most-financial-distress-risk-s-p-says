Debt issuers in media and
entertainment, technology, and health care accounted for 13 of
this year’s 31 defaults through July, according to a report
today by  Standard & Poor’s  fixed-income research group.  Those industries have had rating reductions that “far
exceeded” increases, the highest risk of distressed issuers and
the most ratings lower than B- with a negative outlook or on
watch for a grade cut, according to a report by S&P’s Global
Fixed Income Research.  “The three sectors’ current negative biases are
significantly lower than their long-term averages,” analysts
led by  Diane Vazza  said in the statement.  Distressed debt, with yields of at least 1,000 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, has returned more than
double the average high-yield bond in the U.S. this year,
gaining 7.3 percent through yesterday, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. An index of U.S. speculative-grade debt, rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
lower than BBB- at S&P, returned 3.2 percent, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
