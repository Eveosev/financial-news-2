Azerbaijan  said its arms trade with
Russia is worth $4 billion as the Caspian Sea nation boosted
military spending in connection with its territorial dispute
with neighboring Armenia.  “As of today, military and technical cooperation with
Russia is measured at $4 billion and it tends to grow further,”
President  Ilham Aliyev  said today after meeting with Russian
President  Vladimir Putin  in Baku, the Azeri capital. It was the
first time Azerbaijan disclosed the price of its arms deals.  Armenia seized Nagorno-Karabakh, a landlocked mountainous
enclave about the size of  Rhode Island  with a population of more
than 140,000, and seven adjacent districts from Azerbaijan in a
conflict after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991 that killed
more than 30,000 people and displaced more than 1 million. While
large-scale hostilities ended with a cease-fire in May 1994, the
sides have yet to sign a peace agreement despite years of talks
mediated by Russia, the U.S. and France. Clashes are common
along the heavily militarized cease-fire line with four Azeris
killed in the first quarter alone, according to a count by the
private APA news service.  Azerbaijan has increased military spending by almost 30
times to $3.7 billion in the past decade and repeatedly
threatened to use force to regain control of the territory if
peace talks fail. A failure of talks would risk renewed war in a
region where  BP Plc (BP/)  and partners have invested more than $35
billion in energy projects since 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
