Cattle futures rose to a five-month
high on increased demand as retailers buy meat for Labor Day,
the last U.S. holiday of the year that is warm enough to
encourage outdoor grilling. Hog prices also climbed.  Wholesale-beef  prices  increased 0.7 percent yesterday to
$1.9028 a pound, the highest in almost four weeks, government
data show. Demand tends to rise before Labor Day, which falls on
Sept. 2 this year, and is the third most popular day for
barbecuing in the U.S., according to the Hearth, Patio and
Barbecue Association.  “Labor Day buying is moving the market higher,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des
Moines,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for October delivery added 0.2 percent to
$1.277 a pound at 9:34 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching $1.2855, the highest for a most-active contract
since March 13.  On Aug. 7,  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the biggest U.S. meat
processor, said it would stop buying cattle fed Zilmax, a feed
supplement made by Merck & Co., after finding lame livestock in
its factories. “There’s still a swirl around this growth
additive that Tyson isn’t going to buy anymore supporting the
market,” Roose said.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement advanced 0.1
percent to $1.572 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement increased 0.1 percent to
86.3 cents a pound on the CME, heading for the second straight
gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
