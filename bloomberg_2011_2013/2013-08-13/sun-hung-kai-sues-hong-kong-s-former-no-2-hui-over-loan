Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) ’s
financial services unit sued Rafael Hui,  Hong Kong ’s former
chief secretary who faces a corruption trial in May, for HK$3.16
million ($407,442) over a loan.  Hui, who has pleaded not guilty to bribery and misconduct
charges related to payments and loans from Sun Hung Kai, is
being asked by Honour Finance Co. for an outstanding guaranteed
sum that was lent to Top Faith Enterprises, according to the
lawsuit filed at Hong Kong’s  High Court  yesterday.  Thomas and  Raymond Kwok , the billionaire co-chairmen of Sun
Hung Kai, have also pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy
to commit misconduct in public office in Hong Kong’s highest
profile corruption case.  One of the charges is that Hui failed to declare a loan
from Honour Finance and another is that his company Top Faith
received HK$4.125 million from Sun Hung Kai to be favorably
disposed to Raymond Kwok.  Sun Hung Kai spokeswoman Brenda Wong couldn’t immediately
comment on the case. Two calls to a phone number listed in the
telephone directory under Rafael Hui and the street of his
residential address weren’t answered.  The cases are Honour Finance Co. and Rafael Hui,
HCA1474/2013 in Hong Kong’s Court of First Instance and Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region v Rafael Hui,  Thomas Kwok ,
Raymond Kwok, Thomas Chan and Francis Kwan, HCCC98/2013 in Hong
Kong’s High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
