Japanese  shares  rose, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbing from an almost seven-week low,
as the weaker yen boosted exporters and amid a report Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe is considering a corporate-tax cut.  Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker, increased 2.3
percent. SoftBank Corp. jumped 6.3 percent, pacing gains among
communications stocks. Sony Financial Holdings Inc. added 2.8
percent after the insurance and financial-services company
boosted its dividend forecast. Komatsu Ltd. climbed 1.9 percent
after  Japan ’s machinery orders fell less than expected.  The  Topix index  added 2 percent to 1,157.15 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, with all 33 industry groups advancing. Volume
was 30 percent lower than the 30-day average. The Nikkei 225
rose 2.6 percent to 13,867 after yesterday closing at its lowest
since June 27. Japan’s currency fell 0.5 percent to 97.38 per
dollar as of 3:45 p.m.  “The yen returning to the 97 level is positive and a
corporate tax cut would be reflected on company earnings
directly so its impact on the market would be huge,” said
 Toshihiko Matsuno , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest lender by
market value. “A reduction would help cover the likely dip in
the economy from raising the sales tax, while also boosting
companies in Japan across the board.”  The prime minister asked for a study of lower rates on
businesses as a counterweight to a sales-levy increase, the
Nikkei newspaper reported, citing unidentified people in the
government. Japan may raise the consumption tax by three
percentage points next year to rein in a national debt of more
than twice gross domestic product.  ‘Verbal Intervention’  “Abe’s calling for a study on cutting corporate taxes is
the classic positive ‘verbal intervention’ he is becoming known
for,” said  Gavin Parry , managing director of Hong Kong-based
brokerage Parry International Trading Ltd. “Being vocal on
potential corporate-tax changes spurs expectations for further
capital expenditure. The yen is also positive for stocks.”  Japan’s currency declined as much as 0.7 percent against
the dollar to touch 97.56 today, compared with a high of 95.93
yesterday. Carmakers and electronics manufacturers provided the
 biggest boost  to the Topix today, on optimism a weaker yen will
boost repatriated earnings.  Toyota gained 2.3 percent to 6,330 yen, while  Honda Motor
Co. (7267) , which gets 46 percent of sales from North America, advanced
1.9 percent to 3,795 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera
maker, climbed 1.9 percent to 3,190 yen.  Machinery Orders  Even after falling for the past three months, the Topix is
still up 35 percent this year, retaining Japan’s position as the
world’s best-performing developed equity market. The measure has
risen amid optimism Abe will push through reforms while the Bank
of Japan provides record stimulus in a bid to ignite a recovery
in Asia’s second-largest economy.  June core machinery orders, an indicator of future capital
spending, fell 2.7 percent on the month, the Cabinet Office said
today in  Tokyo . Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a 7
percent drop.  The Topix Machinery Index climbed 1.6 percent. Komatsu rose
1.9 percent to 2,315 yen. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.
added 2.3 percent to 2,074 yen.  Gross domestic product expanded at an annualized 2.6
percent in the second quarter, from a revised 3.8 percent gain
in the previous three months, the Cabinet Office reported
yesterday. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for 3.6 percent growth.  Tax Debate  The GDP data will be used to decide whether to raise the
sales tax. The figures appear “too low to support a smooth
implementation of the consumption tax hike,”  Naoki Kamiyama,
an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo,
wrote in a note today. Growth continues to be “good,” Economy
Minister Akira Amari told reporters after the release yesterday.  Paper makers  climbed the most among the Topix groups today.
Oji Holdings Corp., the biggest company in the sector by market
value, jumped 3.4 percent to 425 yen. A gauge tracking
information and communications stocks gained 3.1 percent for the
second-biggest advance among the subsectors, as SoftBank jumped
6.3 percent to 6,370 yen.  Sony Financial gained 2.8 percent to 1,703 yen after
announcing a plan to pay a dividend of 30 yen per share,
compared with a previous plan of 25 yen a share.  Just nine companies on the Nikkei 225 declined today.
Endoscope-maker  Olympus Corp. (7733)  led losses on the measure, falling
1.8 percent to 2,759 yen. Comsys Holdings Corp., which
constructs telecommunication and electrical facilities, lost 1.3
percent to 1,186 yen for the second-biggest drop.  Retail Sales  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2
percent. The measure yesterday declined 0.1 percent, its fifth
drop in six sessions, as investors awaited today’s report on
U.S. retail sales for hints on when the Federal Reserve will
curtail stimulus.  The Topix  traded  at 1.21 times book value today, compared
with 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.72 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The gauge’s 30-day  historic volatility  was at
25.88 today, down about 40 percent from a June high of 43.22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
