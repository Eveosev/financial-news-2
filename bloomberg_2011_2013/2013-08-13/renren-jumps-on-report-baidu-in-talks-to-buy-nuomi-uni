Renren Inc. (RENN) , owner of a Chinese
social networking website, jumped to a 13-month high after
Sohu.com Inc.’s technology news outlet said the social media
platform is in talks to sell its group-buying unit to  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)   Renren’s American depositary shares soared 7.1 percent to
$4.25 at 11:55 a.m. in New York, set for the highest level since
July 2012. Trading volume was more than twice the daily average
over the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Baidu, which owns  China ’s most-used web search engine, has
been talking with Renren for two months to buy its Nuomi unit,
according to a  report  on Sohu.com today. Baidu declined to
comment for the report and an unidentified Renren media relation
manager didn’t have knowledge of the deal, the Sohu report said.  “The driver for Renren’s gain should be speculation that
it will sell its Nuomi unit to Baidu, which is positive,” Andy Yeung, an Internet stock analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in  New
York , said by phone. “There is also expectation that Renren
earnings will do better because the second-quarter results of
other Internet companies showed that the overall advertising
market is improving.”  Sam Lawn, Renren’s investors relationship director,
couldn’t be reached by phone after business hours in Beijing. An
e-mail to Renren’s public relations department seeking comment
wasn’t immediately returned. Baidu’s Beijing-based spokesman
Kaiser Kuo declined to comment on the report by phone.  Renren is scheduled to  report  second-quarter earnings after
markets close tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
