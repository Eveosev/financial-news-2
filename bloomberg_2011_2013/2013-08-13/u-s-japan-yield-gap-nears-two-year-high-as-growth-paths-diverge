Treasuries dropped the most in more
than a week as U.S. retail sales increased for a fourth month,
adding to speculation the economy is strengthening enough for
the  Federal Reserve  to reduce its bond-buying program.  The  yield gap  between Treasury five- and 10-year notes
widened to almost the most in two years after the Commerce
Department said retail sales rose 0.2 percent in July. Fed Bank
of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart , who has backed the $85
billion in monthly purchases, said policy makers may start to
slow buying at any of their next three gatherings amid “uneven
performance” by the economy. They next meet Sept. 17-18.  “Retail sales was an OK number that doesn’t stand in the
way of September tapering,” said Carlos Pro, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the central bank. “You probably
have  yields (USGG10YR)  moving higher gradually as people position for
tapering. The 2.55-to-2.75 percent range should hold through the
remainder of August.”  The U.S. 10-year note  yield  climbed 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 2.72 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It rose as much as 11
basis points, the biggest intraday jump since Aug. 1. The price
of the 2.5 percent security maturing in August 2023 dropped
27/32, or $8.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 3/32.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was 81.67. It touched
117.89 on July 5, the highest level since December 2010. The
average for 2013 is 67.5.  ‘Tapering Talk’  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose 64 percent to $309.8
billion, from $188.44 billion yesterday. Volume has averaged
$313.4 billion this year.  The  increase  in retail sales followed a 0.6 percent gain in
June that was larger than previously reported. The median
forecast of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.3
percent advance. The measure of demand that feeds into gross
domestic product climbed by the most this year.  “The retail-sales number was good, and that accelerated
the tapering talk,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist
in New York at broker-dealer BTIG LLC. “It’s a thin trade.”  Yield Curve  The difference between yields on five-year notes and 10-year Treasuries widened to 1.24 percentage points, just below
the 1.25 percentage points reached on Aug. 6, the most since
August 2011. Historically, a steeper so-called yield curve
signals investors are anticipating faster economic growth.  The  difference  between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and
similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a
gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life
of the debt, widened to as much as 2.28 percentage points, the
most since May 29.  Producer prices rose 2.4 percent in July from a year
earlier, compared with 2.5 percent in June, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before the Labor Department reports the
data tomorrow. Consumer prices advanced 2 percent, quickening
from 1.8 percent the previous month, another survey shows. The
department is scheduled to report the figure on Aug. 15.  Investors in Treasuries were long in the week ended
yesterday, betting that the prices of the securities will rise,
according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Net Longs  The  proportion  of net longs was at 6 percentage points,
according to JPMorgan. The survey was net neutral in the week
ending Aug. 5.  The percent of outright longs, or bets the securities will
increase in value, rose to 21 percent, from 15 percent. The
percent of outright shorts remained at 15 percent. Investors cut
neutral bets to 64 percent from 70 percent, the survey reported.  Treasuries have lost 2.6 percent this year through
yesterday, while German securities dropped 1.4 percent and
Japanese bonds returned 1 percent, based on Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes.  The Fed won’t taper because of stronger growth, it will
slow its purchases because of the fear of asset bubbles,  Bill Gross , founder and co-chief investment officer of Pacific
Investment Management Co., wrote in a Twitter post. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index has climbed 23 percent this year, after
rallying 13 percent in 2012.  ‘First Step’  Fed policy makers are studying whether the economy is
improving enough for them to trim the monthly bond purchases
they use to pump money into the economy and put downward
pressure on borrowing costs.  “The first adjustments to asset purchases, when they
occur, should be the beginning of a process with steps that will
be determined as later information arrives and certainty about
the direction of the economy accumulates,” Lockhart, who
doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said today in a
speech in Atlanta. “A decision to proceed -- whether it is in
September, October, or December -- ought to be thought of as a
cautious first step.”  The central bank purchased $1.413 billion today of
inflation-indexed securities maturing between February 2040 and
February 2043.  “The July retail sales are in line with the economists and
the Fed thinking --if economic data comes out less than
horrendous, we’ll probably end up seeing reduced bond
purchases,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which oversees $11
billion in fixed-income assets.  Yields on 10-year notes climbed to 2.75 percent on July 8,
the highest since August 2011, after Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said on May 22 policy makers “could take a step down
in our pace of purchases.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
