India ’s rupee fell to within 0.3
percent of a record low and sovereign bonds declined on concern
measures to attract capital inflows won’t be enough to stem the
currency’s slide as growth slows.  The government plans to curb some imports to rein in a
record current-account deficit, Finance Minister Palaniappan
Chidambaram said in parliament yesterday, adding that financial
companies would be able to issue “quasi-sovereign” bonds to
attract investment. The  Reserve Bank  of India will sell 110
billion rupees ($1.8 billion) of 34-day cash management bills
today as it seeks to tighten cash supply to buoy the rupee.  The rupee weakened 0.5 percent to 61.5875 per dollar as of
9:51 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency, which plunged to a record
61.805 on Aug. 6, touched 61.625 earlier. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, rose 14 basis points to 12.48 percent.  “There were significant expectations in the market on
measures that could be used to raise dollar inflows into the
economy” including bonds sold to Indians living abroad, said
 Indranil Pan , chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. The prospects of such debt being offered is decreasing,
weakening the currency, he said.  Mixed Data  Wholesale prices  probably rose 5 percent last month from a
year earlier, compared with 4.86 percent in June, according to
the median of 34 estimates in a Bloomberg survey before a report

year earlier, versus 9.87 percent, official data showed
yesterday.  Industrial production  contracted 2.2 percent in June,
dropping for a second month, and the goods trade deficit was
$12.3 billion in July, almost the same as in June, as exports
rebounded and imports dipped.  “These numbers were too mixed to provide much relief to
policy makers,” analysts at HSBC Holdings Plc, including
Singapore-based Leif Eskesen, wrote in a research report
yesterday.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government bonds due May 2023
rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.36 percent,
according to prices from the central bank’s trading system.
Global funds have cut holdings of Indian notes by $9.9 billion
since May 22, when Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
first signaled debt purchases may be tapered this year.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.7 percent to
63.14 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts dropped 0.9 percent to 63.08. Forwards are
