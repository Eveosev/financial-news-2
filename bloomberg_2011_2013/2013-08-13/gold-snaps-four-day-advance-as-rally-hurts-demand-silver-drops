Gold fell for the first time in a
week as signs of gains in the  U.S. economy  boosted speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will scale back monetary stimulus,
while the dollar’s rally eroded the appeal of the metal.  U.S. retail sales in July rose for the fourth straight
month, consecutive month, government data showed today, and the
 greenback  climbed to a one-week high against a basket of 10
currencies. Fed Reserve Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis
Lockhart  indicated that policy makers may start to slow bond
purchases as soon as next month.  “The U.S. economy is showing signs of improvement,”
 Michael Haigh , the head of commodity research at Societe
Generale SA in New York, said in a telephone interview. “We
could see a further drop in  gold prices .”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to settle
at $1,320.50 an ounce at 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
price climbed 4 percent in the previous four sessions.
Yesterday, the metal reached $1,343.70, the highest for a most-active contract since July 24.  The commodity has slumped 21 percent this year, erasing
$58.9 billion from the value of exchange-traded products backed
by the metal. Some investors lost faith in gold as a store of
value amid a U.S. equity rally and low inflation.  The metal jumped 70 percent from the end of December 2008
to June 2011 as the Fed bought more than $2 trillion in bonds to
bolster the economy.  Silver futures for September delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $21.343 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price
reached $21.75, the highest since June 19. The metal has slumped
29 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery rose 0.1 percent to $1,499.70 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$738.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
