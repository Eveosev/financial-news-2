Copper futures rose to a nine-week
high amid signs of rebounding economies in  Europe  and the U.S.,
the world’s second-biggest consumer of the metal.  Industrial production in the 17 nations that use the euro
gained in June for the fourth month in five, European Union data
show. The U.S. reported today that retail sales climbed for a
fourth straight month in July. Concern that slowing growth would
curb demand, especially from top user  China , sent copper prices
down 15 percent this year through July. Since then, futures have
rallied 6.4 percent.  “Europe is showing signs that the economy is on the
mend,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision
Financial Markets in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“Copper is trying to find a floor for itself.”  Copper futures for delivery in September rose 0.4 percent
to settle at $3.317 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, after earlier climbing to $3.343, the highest for a most-active contract since June 7. Prices gained 4.2 percent last
week, the most since September.  Futures also advanced as money managers bought the metal to
close out bets on falling prices, according to Newedge Group SA.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months added 0.3 percent to $7,275 a metric ton ($3.30 a pound).
Stockpiles monitored by the LME fell for a 20th session to
589,725 tons, the lowest since April 10. Orders to remove the
metal from warehouses rose 0.8 percent to 314,250 tons.  Nickel rose, while aluminum, zinc, lead and tin fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
