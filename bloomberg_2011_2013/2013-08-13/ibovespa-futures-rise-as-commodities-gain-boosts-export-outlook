Ibovespa  futures  rose as higher
commodities boosted the outlook for Brazil’s raw-material
producers amid signs the global economy is strengthening.  Airline  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL3)  may move after
reporting a loss that was wider than analysts had forecast in
the second quarter. Shopping-mall owner  BR Malls Participacoes
SA (BRML3)  may be active after posting adjusted net income of 127.5
million reais ($55.7 million), exceeding  estimates .  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring tomorrow rose 0.9
percent to 50,770 at 9:09 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real weakened
0.1 percent to 2.2910 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials added 0.5 percent and European stocks
advanced after a report from the ZEW Center for European
Economic Research showed that investor confidence in  Germany 
increased more than forecast in August.  “Tracking the external outlook, Brazilian equities will
probably trade higher today,” Banco Bradesco SA’s economic team
led by Octavio de Barros wrote in a note to clients.  The Ibovespa has gained 12 percent from this year’s low on
July 3 as higher commodities prices boosted raw-material
exporters and oil producer  OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes SA
led a rally by companies owned by  Eike Batista . Brazil’s
benchmark equity gauge trades at 12.9 times analysts’  earnings
estimates  for the next four quarters, compared with 10.6 for the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 8.68 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.58 billion
reais this year through Aug. 6, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
