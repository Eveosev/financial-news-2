Zijin Mining Group Co. (2899) ,  China ’s
biggest gold miner by market value, posted the lowest first-half
profit since 2006 after bullion and copper prices dropped and
production costs increased.  Net income fell 54 percent to 1.1 billion yuan ($179.7
million) for the six months ended June 30, from 2.4 billion yuan
a year earlier, the Shanghang, Fujian province-based company
said in a statement today, citing Chinese accounting standards.
The company last month said interim profit would probably
decrease by between 45 percent and 55 percent. Sales increased
24 percent to 26 billion yuan.  That’s the lowest first-half profit since 2006, when the
company reported interim earnings of 662 million yuan, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gold slumped 20 percent this
year, entering a  bear market  in April, and headed for its first
annual decline since 2000.  “Gold prices are still expected to trend lower after
rebounding from excessive declines,” the company said, citing a
strong dollar and China’s economic slowdown. The company’s
“full-year result may see a relatively large fall from last
year.”  The company recorded 332.1 million yuan in impairment
losses in the first half after declines in gold and other metal
prices trimmed the value of inventories, compared with 375 yuan
a year earlier, according to today’s statement.  Zijin dropped 1.1 percent to close at HK$1.84 in Hong Kong
trading, compared with a 1.2 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang
Seng Index. (HSI)  The stock has declined 40 percent this year. Its
Shanghai-traded shares slid 0.8 percent today.  Gold for immediate delivery declined 0.2 percent to
$1,336.15 an ounce as of 4:13 p.m. Shanghai time. Prices dropped
to $1,200.65 on June 27, the lowest level since Aug. 2010.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
