The  New York Yankees  have won
consecutive games for the first time in a month, after beating
the Los Angeles Angels 2-1 behind eight scoreless innings from
starting pitcher Hiroki Kuroda.  Curtis Granderson  hit a solo home run for the Yankees and
 David Robertson  recorded the final two outs in the ninth inning
last night in New York as Mariano Rivera got the day off after
blowing three straight save opportunities.  It was the first time the Yankees (60-57) had logged back-to-back Major League Baseball wins since July 10-12, when they
won three in a row. Before their current two-game winning streak,
the Yankees had lost 15 of 22 games.  Kuroda allowed three hits over eight innings to improve his
record to 11-7 on the season. The Angels (53-64) lost for the
12th time in 17 games.  Yu Darvish of the Texas Rangers took a no-hitter into the
eighth inning before allowing a solo home run to Carlos Corporan
in yesterdayâ€™s 2-1 win at the Houston Astros. It was the only
hit allowed over eight innings by Darvish, who finished with 15
strikeouts and one walk to improve to 12-5.  Joe Nathan  got three outs for his 35th save of the season
as the Rangers won their eighth straight game and maintained a
one-game lead atop the American League West division over the
Oakland Athletics, who beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-1.  Matt Latos of the Cincinnati Reds threw eight scoreless
innings in a 2-0 win against the  Chicago Cubs  to improve to 12-3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
