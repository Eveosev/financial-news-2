EnQuest Plc (ENQ) , a North Sea oil and gas
producer, fell in London trading after saying output this year
will be in the lower half of its range.  Shares slipped as much as 3.2 percent and traded at 123.2
pence as of 8:20 a.m. local time. The company said production
will be closer to 22,000 barrels a day than to 27,000 barrels a
day in 2013. Profit after tax and finance costs dropped 24
percent to $97.7 million in the first half, while output in the
period rose 6 percent to 21,455 barrels a day.  EnQuest is stepping up investment and said that its
Alma/Galia field will produce first oil in early 2014, adding
13,000 barrels a day. The company predicts the development of
Alma and the Kraken field will help bring the company’s output
to 50,000 barrels a day over the next few years.  “We had a solid first half performance,” Chief Executive
Officer Amjad Bseisu said in a telephone interview. “We’re not
giving production guidance for 2014 yet, but with Alma we should
have significant growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
