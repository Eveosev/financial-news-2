Bonds of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  fell after
billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  said he has built up a stake in
the world’s most valuable technology company.  Apple’s $5.5 billion of 2.4 percent notes due May 2023
decreased 1.5 cents to 90.1 cents on the dollar to yield 3.61
percent as of 3:44 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  “We currently have a large position in Apple. We believe
the company to be extremely undervalued,” Icahn wrote in a
posting on Twitter Inc.’s website. He added that he spoke to
Apple Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  today and discussed his
view that a larger stock buyback should be done now. “We plan
to speak again shortly,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
