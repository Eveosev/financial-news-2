The  International Cricket Council 
provisionally suspended nine people for alleged anti-corruption
breaches during the 2013 Bangladesh Premier League season.  The investigation centers on the Dhaka Gladiators franchise
and involves match-fixing and spot-fixing, where players
manipulate specific actions in a game rather than the result, as
well as the failure of the individuals to report approaches
asking them to take part in the conspiracy, the ICC said.  “The evidence uncovered is a grave reminder of the need
for the sport to remain vigilant against the continuing threat
of corruption, and for players and support personnel to take
personal responsibility for protecting the integrity of the
game,” ICC Chief Executive David Richardson said in a
 statement .  Bangladesh Cricket Board rules prohibit the individuals
involved from being identified until the end of the disciplinary
proceedings, the ICC said.  Seven are accused of match-fixing, and the other two are
charged with failing to report approaches. They’ve been banned
from all cricket activities pending the completion of the
investigation and have 14 days to accept the charges or request
a hearing.  The penalty for match-fixing is a ban of five years to
lifetime, while those sanctioned for failure to report
approaches face a one- to five-year suspension, the ICC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
