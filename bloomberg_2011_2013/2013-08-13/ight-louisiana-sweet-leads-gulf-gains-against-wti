Light Louisiana Sweet strengthened
against West Texas Intermediate more than other oils produced on
the Gulf Coast as the U.S. benchmark lost ground to Brent.  WTIâ€™s discount to its European counterpart widened by 13
cents to $2.99 a barrel, based on settlement prices, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. When the U.S. grade loses to
Brent, it can raise the value of domestic oils that compete at
Gulf Coast refineries with foreign crudes priced against the
international benchmark.  LLS gained 40 cents a barrel against WTI to a premium of
$5.65 as of 2:01 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet rose 35 cents to a premium of $5.20 a
barrel. Mars Blend advanced by 15 cents to a discount of 75
cents to WTI and Poseidon climbed 10 cents to a discount of $1 a
barrel. The premium for Thunder Horse was unchanged at $2.  Bakken crude from North Dakota gained 25 cents to a
discount of $3.50 a barrel below WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
