Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , the owner of China’s
third-largest Web portal, fell the most in two weeks in  New York 
after DoNews said negotiations to sell its search engine to
 Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU)  ended.  American depositary receipts of Sohu slumped 5.4 percent to
$61.05 at 1:58 p.m. in New York, paring a 29 percent rally this
year. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. climbed 1 percent to 96.95.  Prolonged talks between Sohu and Qihoo made it more
difficult for the two companies to reach an agreement on the
sale of the search engine  Sogou , Chinese technology news website
DoNews said, citing unidentified persons. Sohu Chief Executive
Officer Charles Zhang said in May that the company was seeking
investment in its search unit to drive growth.  “The no-deal report is negative to Sohu because its stock
gain over the past few months was mainly driven by speculation
on selling Sogou to Qihoo,” Henry Guo, an analyst at ABR
Investment Strategy LLC, said by phone from  San Francisco .
“People expected Sohu to receive both stock and cash from Qihoo
for the sale.”  Eric  Yuan , Sohu’s media manager, couldn’t be reached by
phone after business hours in Beijing. Lee Roth, Qihoo’s
external public relations manager at The Piacente Group Inc.,
didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
