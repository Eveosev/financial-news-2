The  butterfly chart spread  formed by
five-, 10- and 30-year Treasury yields suggests that 10-year
notes, at the cheapest level in more than two years, will
outperform the other maturities, according to CRT Capital Group
LLC, citing  technical analysis .  The butterfly index spread, which measures how the 10-year
note is performing against the other two securities, is at 19.6
basis points, the cheapest level since July 2011. It is poised
to rally to 14 basis points against the other two securities,
 Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , said in a telephone interview.  A negative reading indicates the market is bullish on the
benchmark  10-year note , while an advance toward positive figures
signals investors are more bearish on the middle of the three
securities, making it relatively cheap versus the others.  “Ten-year notes offer a good buying opportunity at these
levels,” Lyngen said. “The bearish move has been relatively
swift and has brought 10-year yields back to levels that require
more fundamental backing to justify. And, right now, there is no
compelling reason to push higher in yield.”  The U.S. 10-year  note yield  climbed eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 2.70 percent at 1:15 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 2.5
percent note maturing in August 2023 dropped 22/32, or $6.88 per
$1,000 face value, to 98 7/32.  Five-year note yields added eight basis points to 1.46
percent and 30-year bonds yields rose six basis points to 3.74
percent.  Ten-year  U.S. debt  has lost 5.6 percent this year, while
the broader Treasury market has lost 2.7 percent, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
