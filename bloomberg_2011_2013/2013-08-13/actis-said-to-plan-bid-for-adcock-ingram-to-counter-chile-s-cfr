Actis LLP, a London-based private-equity firm, has proposed an offer for  Adcock Ingram Holdings
Ltd. (AIP)  to rival a bid from Chilean drugmaker  CFR Pharmaceuticals
SA (CFR) , two people familiar with the matter said.  Actis made a 70 rand ($7.02) per share offer to Adcock’s
board in late July on condition it gets the same information as
given to CFR Pharmaceuticals, one of the people said. More than
80 percent of the offer would be in cash, the person said.  Adcock, the Johannesburg-based maker of drugs including
Panado painkillers, said on July 3 it had entered exclusive
talks with CFR after receiving a non-binding cash and shares bid
valued at a potential 73.51 rand a share.  Adcock  shares  advanced as much as 4.6 percent and traded
1.9 percent higher at 67.30 rand as of 4:34 p.m. in
Johannesburg, valuing the company at 11.8 billion rand. The
stock has advanced 25 percent this year.  Adcock declined to comment, according to Brunswick, which
handles the communications for the company. John van Wyk, head
of  Africa  for Actis, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
