Natural gas futures declined in  New
York  for the second time in three days on speculation that mild
weather will expand a U.S. stockpile surplus.  Gas dropped 0.8 percent as government data scheduled for
release Aug. 15 may show that inventories rose 71 billion cubic
feet last week, based on the median of 10 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain for the period
is 42 billion. The weather may be normal or cooler than average
in most of the eastern U.S. through Aug. 21, according to
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  “There wasn’t a lot of extreme heat last week, so we may
see a storage number above and beyond what we would usually
see,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “This market is working
on the downside.”  Natural gas for September delivery fell 2.5 cents to settle
at $3.285 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 59 percent above the
100-day average at 2:39 p.m. Prices are up 20 percent from a
year ago.  The discount of September to October futures widened 0.2
cent to 2.7 cents. October gas traded 40.3 cents below the
January contract, compared with 40.1 cents yesterday  September $3.15 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.1 cent lower at 2.9 cents per
million Btu on volume of 812 at 2:458 p.m. Puts accounted for 81
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money
options expiring in September was 32.16 percent at 2:30 p.m.,
compared with 33.15 percent yesterday.  Supply Report  Gas stockpiles totaled 2.941 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Aug. 2, or 0.7 percent above the five-year average,
rising to a  surplus  for the first time since March. Inventories
were 9.2 percent below year-earlier supplies.  The high in New York on Aug. 21 may be 79 degrees
Fahrenheit (26 Celsius), 3 lower than usual, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . Temperatures in
 Boston  may also reach 79, matching the normal reading.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Northeast natural gas prices may drop as supplies rise,
said Stefan Revielle, an analyst at Credit Suisse in New York,
in a note to clients today.  “Breakneck” production growth in the Marcellus formation
has caused Northeast hub prices to decline relative to the
benchmark  Henry Hub  in  Louisiana , Revielle said. Pipeline
capacity to the region may climb 6.6 billion cubic feet a day
through 2014, he said.  Gas Production  Lower-48 state  natural gas output  was little changed in May
as new wells began operating in the Northeast’s Marcellus shale
formation while Wyoming production declined during scheduled
maintenance, government data showed.  Gross gas production in the contiguous states totaled 73.37
billion cubic feet a day, compared with a revised 73.38 billion
in April, the EIA’s monthly  EIA-914  report showed July 31.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first four months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1985, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
