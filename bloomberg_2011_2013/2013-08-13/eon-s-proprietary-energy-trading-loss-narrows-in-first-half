EON SE , Germany’s biggest utility,
said its proprietary energy trading loss narrowed in the first
six months after lower earnings in gas, oil, and eastern
European power markets.  The Dusseldorf-based utility made a loss from trading
energy for its own account of 13 million euros ($17.3 million)
on an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, according to its first-half report published
today. That compares with a loss of 31 million euros in the same
period  last year .  EON’s profit from optimization, or maximizing the value of
its  power plants , fell 50 percent to 641 million euros, the
company said.  EON buys and sells electricity, natural gas, oil, coal,
 carbon emissions  and biomass through its global commodities
unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
