(Corrects conversion in lead to drop extra zeroes.)  National Water Co. plans to build a
reservoir to boost supplies and storage capacity in the Red Sea
coastal city of Jeddah for 2.2 billion Saudi riyals ($590
million), the Arab News reported, citing an announcement from
the state-run utility in the kingdomâ€™s second-biggest city.  The first phase of the water facility, with an eventual
capacity of 6 million cubic meters, would help meet seasonal
needs during Ramadan and shortages in Jeddah, the company said.
 Saudi Arabia , the biggest oil producer, makes more desalinated
water than any other nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
