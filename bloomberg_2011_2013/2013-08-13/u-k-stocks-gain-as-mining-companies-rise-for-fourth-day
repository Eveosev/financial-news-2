U.K. stocks  rose as a gauge of
mining companies posted its biggest four-day gain in 21 months
and a measure of German investor confidence increased.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  completed its longest rally in a year as UBS
AG recommended that investors buy the stock. An index of London-listed life insurers declined the most in two weeks as
 Prudential Plc (PRU)  fell from its highest price since at least 1988.
 Old Mutual Plc (OML)  slipped 2.6 percent after Nomura Holdings Inc.
downgraded the insurer.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 37.6 points, or 0.6 percent, to
6,611.94 at the close of trading in London. The FTSE All-Share
Index advanced 0.5 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed
0.2 percent today.  “You have the basis of a decent rally for the mining
sector,” said Henry Dixon, who oversees 72 million pounds ($111
million) as a London-based  fund manager  at Matterley, a unit of
Charles Stanley Group Plc. “After a severe de-rating where
share prices fell more than earnings, you’re in a situation
where history, valuation and the growth picture is on your side.
Mining and oil and gas stocks are now extremely cheap and will
be drivers for the U.K. stock market.”  A gauge of  oil and gas producers  on the FTSE 350 Index has
gained 3.1 percent so far this year, compared with a 13 percent
advance for the broader index. Energy companies trade at 9.6
times projected earnings on a weekly basis, lower than their 10-year average of 10.1 times.  Mining Shares  A measure of  mining companies  trades at 12.7 times forecast
earnings, less than the 13.1 times for the FTSE 350. An index of
London-listed  commodity producers  rose 1.4 percent to an 11-week
high as Rio Tinto Group gained 2.2 percent to 3,263 pence and
Glencore Xstrata Plc added 2 percent to 307.5 pence. The measure
has rallied 11 percent in the last four trading days, reducing
its year-to-date retreat to 12 percent.  Fresnillo jumped 5.6 percent to 1,165 pence, its highest
price in two months. UBS initiated its coverage of the gold and
silver producer with a buy  rating . Analysts led by Daniel Major
cited the company’s low costs and ability to generate free  cash
flow  even as the price of precious metals slumps.  The FTSE 100 has  surged 9.7 percent  from its low on June 24
as the  Bank of England  and the  European Central Bank  signaled
that  interest rates  will stay low, while the  Federal Reserve 
said it remains flexible on the pace of bond buying. The U.K.
equity benchmark is still 3.3 percent below its May 22 high,
which was the highest level since December 1999.  House Prices  The  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors’  gauge of
property prices  rose to 36 in July, its highest reading since
November 2006, from 21 in June. That exceeded the  median
estimate  for a figure of 24 in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
A positive number means more respondents saw values increase
than decrease. A measure of inquiries from new buyers rose to 53
from 38, the most in four years, RICS said, citing its monthly
poll of property surveyors.  In Germany, a gauge of investor confidence climbed more
than estimated. The ZEW Center for European Economic Research’s
index of investor and analyst expectations rose to 42 in August.
That exceeded the  median economist estimate  of 39.9 in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Resolution Ltd. (RSL)  added 1.8 percent to 329.5 after posting
first-half operating profit that beat analysts’ estimates as the
value of new business in the U.K. jumped. Profit climbed to 191
million pounds in the first six months of this year, exceeding
the 180 million-pound average of analyst estimates provided by
the company.  Life Insurers  An index of life insurers dropped 0.8 percent, wiping the
most  points  off the FTSE 350. Prudential, the U.K.’s largest
insurer, slipped 1.4 percent to 1,215 pence, while  Standard Life
Plc (SL/)  lost 1.2 percent to 365.7 pence.  Old Mutual slipped 2.6 percent to 196.1 pence after Nomura
downgraded the insurer to neutral from buy, saying investors may
regard its  dependence  on South Africa for sales as negative.  Michael Page  International Plc slid 4 percent to 450.2
pence after the recruitment consultancy predicted that its
largest markets will remain difficult.  “With difficult conditions likely to continue in several
markets and as this is the seasonally quieter summer period in
both continental Europe and the U.K., we expect the third
quarter will be another challenging quarter,” Steve Ingham,
Michael Page’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
