Soybeans climbed, extending their
biggest gain in 13 months, after the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  predicted a smaller domestic harvest than forecast
last month. Corn erased early losses and wheat advanced.  The oilseed for November delivery jumped as much as 0.8
percent to $12.3525 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest since July 25, and was at $12.335 by 11:13 a.m. in
 Singapore . Futures rallied 3.6 percent yesterday, the biggest
gain since June 2012.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of eight agricultural
commodities slumped 18 percent this year as corn lost 34 percent
and soybeans dropped 12 percent on expectations that record U.S.
harvests would bolster global inventories eroded by last year’s
drought in the world’s biggest grower. Farmers in the country
will collect 3.255 billion bushels of soybeans, down from 3.42
billion expected last month, the USDA said yesterday.  “We’re seeing some follow-through price action on the back
of the bullish WASDE,” said Graydon Chong, an analyst at
Rabobank International in Sydney, referring to the USDA’s World
Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report. “We’re seeing
a bullish tone come back on to the market.”  U.S. corn production may reach 13.763 billion bushels, less
than the 13.95 billion forecast in July, the USDA said. Even
with reduced yield prospects, domestic output will be a record.  Corn for December delivery was little changed at $4.645 a
bushel after swinging between gains and losses. Prices dropped
to $4.465 yesterday, the lowest since September 2010, before
rallying 2.4 percent to close at $4.64.  Wheat for delivery in December advanced 0.3 percent to
$6.51 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
