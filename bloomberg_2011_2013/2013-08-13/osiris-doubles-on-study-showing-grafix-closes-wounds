Osiris Therapeutics Inc. (OSIR) ’s shares
more than doubled after the regenerative-tissue company said a
trial of its living stem cell treatment closed three times as
many diabetic foot ulcers as standard care.  Osiris rose to $21.75 at 12:53 p.m.  New York  time, after
earlier reaching $24.78 for the biggest intraday gain since the
company first sold shares to public in August 2006.  Interim results from 97 patients in the study found 62
percent of those on Osiris’s Grafix had their wound completely
closed compared with 21 percent who received conventional
treatment, the Columbia, Maryland-based company said today in a
statement. Grafix is a flexible, conforming membrane that is
applied directly to wounds. The trial also found the therapy
also closed wounds faster.  “Osiris has established a new standard in diabetic wound
care and has demonstrated to the world the tremendous impact
stem cell products can have in medicine,” C. Randal Mills,
chief executive officer, said in the statement. “Diabetic foot
ulcers afflict 25 percent of all diabetics and are responsible
for more hospitalizations than any other diabetic
complication.”  The trial is discontinuing the blind phase of the study
where it’s not revealed which patients are receiving which
treatment. Patients who were receiving the standard of care will
be offered treatment with Grafix, Osiris said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
