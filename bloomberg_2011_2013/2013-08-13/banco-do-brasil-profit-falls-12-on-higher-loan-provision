Banco do Brasil SA , Latin America’s
largest lender by assets, said second-quarter profit fell 12
percent, matching analysts’ estimates as the bank set aside more
money to cover bad loans.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time charges,
declined to 2.63 billion reais ($1.14 billion) from 2.99 billion
reais a year earlier, the Brasilia-based bank said today in a
statement. That compared with the  average  estimate of 2.62
billion reais in a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts. Non-adjusted net income, which includes the  BB Seguridade
Participacoes SA (BBSE3)  insurance unit’s initial public offering, was
7.5 billion reais.  Provisions rose 15 percent to 4.2 billion reais in the
second quarter from a year earlier as the loan book expanded 26
percent to 638.6 billion reais. Government-controlled lenders
such as Banco do Brasil, led by Chief Executive Officer Aldemir Bendine, 49, are boosting credit faster than non-state lenders
as President Dilma Rousseff pushes them to help reignite the
economy. Economists cut their 2013 growth estimate 13 times in
the past 14 weeks, a weekly survey by the central bank shows.  “Banco do Brasil is expanding its loan book at a very
sustainable pace,” Bendine told reporters in Sao Paulo today,
adding that the bank doesn’t expect credit quality to
deteriorate because of the lending expansion.  Banco do Brasil’s rate of debt payments overdue more than
90 days was 1.9 percent, down from about 2.2 percent a year
earlier and 2 percent in the previous three months.  Misses Estimate  The provisions were higher than estimates by Banco Bradesco
BBI SA analysts including Carlos Firetti, who predicted 3.84
billion reais.  The company raised its estimates for credit growth this
year to a range of 17 percent to 21 percent, according to the
statement. The previous forecast was 16 percent to 20 percent.
Banco do Brasil reduced its estimates for growth in net interest
income to 4 percent to 7 percent this year from 7 percent to 10
percent, citing increases in “lines of lower risk.”  Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA, the
nation’s two biggest lenders by market value, cut their credit-growth forecasts last month, citing worsening prospects for the
economy. Itau lowered its 2013 credit estimate to as much as 11
percent from 14 percent, while Bradesco reduced its forecast to
as much as 15 percent from 17 percent.  Shares Rise  Banco do Brasil’s shares climbed 0.2 percent to 23 reais at
1:45 p.m. in Sao Paulo. They fell 10 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a decline of 17 percent for  Brazil ’s
Ibovespa benchmark index.  BB Seguridade raised 11.5 billion reais in April with its
share offering, the world’s largest IPO this year.  Banco Votorantim, the auto-loan company in which Banco do
Brasil has about a 50 percent stake, reported a loss of 196
million reais, after a loss of 278 million reais in the three
previous months. Banco do Brasil expects Votorantim to post a
profit by the fourth quarter of this year, Chief Financial
Officer Ivan Monteiro told reporters in Sao Paulo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
