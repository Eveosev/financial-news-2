Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  said Chief
Operating Officer Steve Dixon and three other top executives are
leaving as part of a reorganization of the leadership of the
second largest producer of natural gas in the U.S.  Dixon, who joined Chesapeake in 1991, had served as interim
chief executive officer in April while the Oklahoma City-based
company searched for a permanent replacement for ousted co-founder  Aubrey McClendon . Doug Lawler, who became CEO in May,
informed employees about the departures today in a memo.  Jeff Fisher, executive vice president of production; Steve Miller, senior vice president of drilling; and Martha Burger,
senior vice president of human and corporate resources are also
leaving, according to the memo. Dixon had been COO since 2006.  “This restructuring will position Chesapeake to be more
competitive and focused, and it will further our strategies of
financial discipline and profitable and efficient growth from
captured resources,” Lawler said in the memo.  McClendon stepped down after a shareholder revolt by  Carl Icahn  and Southeastern Asset Management Inc. A board inquiry
into McClendon’s use of personal stakes in company-owned wells
to obtain more than $800 million in private loans cleared him of
any intentional wrongdoing in February.  Chesapeake produces more U.S. gas than any explorer except
