India , the world’s biggest gold
user, raised the tax on imports for a third time this year to
curtail demand and contain a record current-account deficit
that’s weakened the rupee to an all-time low.  The tariffs on gold and platinum imports were increased to
10 percent from 8 percent, while the levy on silver was boosted
to 10 percent from 6 percent, the Ministry of Finance said in a
notification tabled in parliament today. Taxes on shipments of
gold concentrates, ores and dore bars will rise to 8 percent
from 6 percent, while the duty on silver dore bars will climb to
7 percent from 3 percent, the ministry said in a statement.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram plans to curtail
gold imports to 850 metric tons this year to reduce the  current-account deficit  and boost capital inflows by allowing state-run
financial companies to issue “quasi-sovereign” bonds to
finance infrastructure investments. The deficit, mainly fueled
by crude oil and bullion imports, is the biggest risk to the
$1.9 trillion economy, according to the central bank. The rupee
fell to a record low of 61.8050 per dollar Aug. 6.  “An increase in taxes will boost local prices and increase
smuggling,” said Bachhraj Bamalwa, a director at the All India
Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation. “Gold imports may not be
more than 150 tons in the July-December period.”  India imported 478 tons in the six months through December
last year, taking full-year purchases to 860 tons, according to
the World Gold Council. The government also increased the excise
duty on refined gold to 9 percent from 7 percent, and that of
silver to 8 percent from 4 percent, the ministry said.  Imports Halted  Spot gold fell 0.6 percent to $1,330.09 an ounce at 6:59
p.m. in Mumbai. The metal rebounded 13 percent since reaching a
34-month low of $1,180.50 on June 28. Gold for delivery in
October advanced as much as 1.4 percent to 29,333 rupees ($480)
per 10 grams on the  Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. (MCX)  and
was last at 28,990 rupees.  Imports by banks and other traders have come to a
standstill after the Reserve Bank of India on July 22 said
shippers may supply gold only to the jewelry business and
bullion dealers who sell to jewelers. Importers have to retain
20 percent of the gold in bonded warehouses and will be allowed
to make fresh purchases only after at least 75 percent of the
quantity has been exported, according to the bank.  Metal Shortage  “Government’s intention is to ensure that gold imports are
reduced,” said Rajesh Mehta, chairman of  Rajesh Exports Ltd. (RJEX) 
“Once the festival season starts there could be a shortage in
the market. With this duty increase more imports from the
legitimate channels will get into the illegitimate channel.”  Imports surged 87 percent to 383 tons in the four months
through July from 205 tons during the same time a year earlier,
Revenue Secretary Sumit Bose said today. Silver shipments jumped
three fold to 127.9 billion rupees between April and July from
42.8 billion rupees a year earlier, the ministry said.  Consumption in India, which imports almost all the bullion
it needs, accounted for 20 percent of global demand in 2012,
according to data from the gold council. Bullion imports were
845 tons in the 12 months ended March 31, while silver shipments
totaled 1,963 tons, according to the Ministry of Finance.  Hurting Demand  “The combination of limited imports, as local participants
sort through the various regulation changes this year, higher
taxes and rupee weakness make gold considerably more expensive,
which would in turn hurt demand,” Joni Teves, an analyst at UBS
AG in  London , said in an e-mailed statement. The tax increase
will further raise the incentive for unofficial flows and the
government may need to start cracking down, she said.  The  current-account deficit , the broadest measure of trade,
tracking goods, services and investment income, widened to $87.8
billion, or 4.8 percent of the gross domestic product, in the
year ended March 31 from $78.2 billion in 2011-2012, according
to official data.  India may generate about $11 billion of inflows and keep
the current-account gap at $70 billion, or 3.7 percent of gross
domestic product, in the current fiscal year, Chidambaram said
yesterday. The increase in taxes on bullion and other
commodities may help garner 48.3 billion rupees, Bose said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
