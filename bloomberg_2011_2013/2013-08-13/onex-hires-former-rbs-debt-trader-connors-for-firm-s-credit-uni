Onex Corp. (OCX) ,  Canada ’s biggest  buyout
firm , has hired Kevin Connors, a former managing director at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, as a senior trader in its $2.8
billion debt unit.  Connors joined Onex Credit Partners LLC’s Englewood Cliffs,
New Jersey, office at the end of July, according to Michael Gelblat, the unit’s chief executive officer. Before  RBS (RBS) , Connors
was a senior managing director at Bear Stearns Cos., Gelblat
said in an e-mail. Connors has mainly focused on buying and
selling distressed debt.  Onex, founded by Gerald Schwartz, manages about $11 billion
from external clients as well as about $5.4 billion of its own
capital, according to its  website . Its credit unit employs about
20 people and oversees long-short strategies and leveraged loan-focused funds, according to the website.  The lowest-rated high-yield bonds have performed better
than any other tier of corporate debt, gaining 7.5 percent this
year after a 20.3 percent return in 2012, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. Leveraged loans, which have
attracted record volumes of cash from individual investors this
year, have returned 12.7 percent since 2011, according to the
Standard & Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
