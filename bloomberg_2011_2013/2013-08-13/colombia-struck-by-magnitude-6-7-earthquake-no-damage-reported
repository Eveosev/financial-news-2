Colombia was struck by its largest
earthquake in six years today, shaking buildings in Medellin and
felt as far away as Panama City. No damage or casualties have
been reported.  There were “no victims to mourn and nothing to fear,”
President  Juan Manuel Santos  said in a statement on Twitter.  The 6.7-magnitude quake struck 63 miles (101 kilometers)
west of the coastal city of Mutis at a depth of 2.7 miles at
10:43 a.m. local time, the  U.S. Geological Survey  said on its
 website . There is no risk of a tsunami, Carlos Ivan Marquez, the
head of risk management at the country’s disaster agency known
as UNGRD, said in a telephone interview.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-controlled oil producer, has
had no reports of damage, the company said today in an e-mailed
response to questions.  The earthquake was Colombia’s largest since a 6.8-magnitude
temblor hit the Andean nation’s west coast in September 2007,
according to the USGS. Colombia, a coffee, oil and metal
producing country, is located on  South America ’s northwestern
Pacific and Caribbean coasts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
