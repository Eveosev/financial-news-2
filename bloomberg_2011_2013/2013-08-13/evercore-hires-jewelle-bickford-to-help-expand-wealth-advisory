Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) ,  the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Roger Altman, hired Jewelle Bickford as a partner in its wealth-management unit.  Bickford was a senior strategist at GenSpring Family
Offices, New York-based Evercore said today in a statement.
Before joining GenSpring in 2009, she was a global partner at
Rothschild Group, where she was head of debt capital markets for
its broker-dealer unit. She previously merged her investment-banking firm into Rothschild Inc. in 1994.  Evercore, run by Chief Executive Officer Ralph Schlosstein,
has expanded in wealth management through acquisitions and
hiring. In December, it purchased San Francisco-based Mt. Eden
Investment Advisors LLC, which manages about $645 million.
Evercore has hired managing directors for its wealth unit from
Bank of America Corp.  “I’ve known Jewelle for years and am confident that her
professional experience and range of relationships will enable
her to make a significant contribution,” Altman said in the
statement.  Bickford will be based in New York and report to Jeff Maurer, CEO of Evercore Wealth Management, according to the
statement. She’s on the board of  Women for Women International 
and the  Women’s Media Center , the company said. Bickford also is
a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and founded its
task force on the role of women in economic and political
development in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, Evercore
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
