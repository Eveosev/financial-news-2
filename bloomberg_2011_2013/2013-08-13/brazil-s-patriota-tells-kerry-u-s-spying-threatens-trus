The U.S. government hasn’t found the
best path to combat global terrorism, and the lack of
information about its spy program threatens ties with  Brazil ,
the South American country’s foreign minister said today.  “We are now facing a new type of challenge in our
bilateral relations,” Minister Antonio Patriota told reporters
in Brasilia in a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of
State John Kerry. “If those challenges are not resolved in a
satisfactory way, we run the risk of casting a shadow of
distrust over our work.”  Brazil’s government is probing allegations the U.S.
monitored phone calls and e-mail in Latin America’s largest
economy, President Dilma Rousseff said last month. O Globo
newspaper reported July 6 Brazil was a priority target of U.S.
monitoring alongside countries including China and  Iran . The
article was based on documents obtained from former U.S.
security contractor Edward Snowden.  The U.S. government understands news of its intelligence
programs have upset some people and it has engaged directly with
Brazilian authorities to increase transparency, Kerry said. U.S.
anti-terror programs are designed to prevent bombings before
they happen and have protected U.S. and foreign citizens, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
