A new version of a rule requiring
lenders to keep a stake in risky mortgages that they securitize
will be proposed by U.S. regulators in the last week of August,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  The 500-page draft regulation written by a panel of six
agencies will replace a more stringent proposal for the
Qualified Residential Mortgage rule, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because the plan isnâ€™t public. The first
version drew protests from housing industry participants and
consumer groups when it was released in 2011.  The plan will require banks to retain a slice of mortgages
when borrowers are spending more than 43 percent of their
monthly income on all of their debt. The earlier version would
have required banks to keep a stake in loans when borrowers were
spending more than 36 percent of their income on all loan
payments and in loans with a down payment of less than 20
percent. The rule will carve out mortgages backed by  Fannie Mae 
and  Freddie Mac , one of the people said.  The agencies will seek public comment before each holds a
vote on the final rule. The agencies involved in the rulemaking
are the  Federal Reserve , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
Department of Housing and Urban Development,  Federal Housing
Finance Agency , Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and
Securities and Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporters on this story:
