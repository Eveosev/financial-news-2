Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc (DANGSUGA) ,
Nigeria’s biggest producer of the sweetener, plans to almost
double refining capacity to 2.75 million metric tons by 2017 as
it expands its Lagos plant, Chief Executive Officer Abdullahi Sule said.  “We are increasing capacity to enter more African
countries beginning with Mali, Gambia,  Burkina Faso  and Togo
this year and Liberia, Senegal and Mauritania in 2014,” he said
on a conference call from Lagos, the commercial capital.  Dangote Sugar, which has a 70 percent share of the Nigerian
market plans to increase crop production to 250,000 tons a year
by 2017 and achieve 1 million tons output by 2020 as it acquires
sugar plantations across Nigeria, Sule said.  The Nigerian government has removed duties on imported
machinery and spare parts for sugar processing companies from
this year, President Goodluck Jonathan has said. It also granted
a five-year  tax exemption  for “sugarcane to sugar” investors
and imposed import duties of 60 percent on raw sugar, and 80
percent on refined sugar. Africa’s biggest oil producer wants to
revive the agricultural industry to cut imports.  Dangote Sugar shares fell 3.1 percent to 11.04 naira at the
close in Lagos. The stock has risen 84 percent this year,
compared with a 34 percent increase in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
