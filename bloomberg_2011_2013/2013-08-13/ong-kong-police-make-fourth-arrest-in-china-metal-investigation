Hong Kong ’s police arrested a fourth
person related to the investigation into  China Metal Recycling
Holdings Ltd. (773) , the company that the city’s securities regulator
accused of falsifying sales.  A 47 year-old man surnamed Chun was arrested yesterday on
suspected false accounting and detained for further
investigation, the police said in a statement. Alexander Lee, a
lawyer representing China Metal’s Chairman Chun Chi Wai, didn’t
immediately answer calls to his office and mobile phone.  The Securities and Futures Commission won a court order
last month to appoint provisional liquidators to the company
after it found evidence China Metal inflated the size of its
business in its 2009 initial public offering. The liquidator
sued Chun and his wife, Lai Wun Yin, for fraud, according to a
lawsuit filed on July 31 at Hong Kong’s  High Court .  A 37 year-old man surnamed Fung, a 46 year-old man surnamed
Lam and a 42 year-old woman surnamed Lai were arrested last
month relating to the case. All three are on bail, according
police statements.  Shares of China Metal traded in Hong Kong have been
suspended since January. Chun and Lai founded the company in
2000, according to the company’s website.  The liquidator’s case is HCA1412/2013 and the SFC case is
HCCW 210/2013. Both are in Hong Kong’s Court of First Instance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
