Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest
engineering company, broke ground today on a 11.5 megawatt wind
farm at the U.S. Energy Department’s Pantex Plant near Amarillo,
Texas, the main site for the country’s nuclear weapons
stockpile.  Pantex will get about 65 percent of its power from the five
2.3 megawatt Siemens turbines that will be the largest
federally-owned wind farm when completed in July 2014, the
Washington, D.C.-based department said today in a  statement .  The project is expected to generate an average of $2.8
million annually in energy savings that will be used to fund its
cost through an 18-year performance-based  contract , the
department said.  Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure
Capital Inc. (HASI)  is providing upfront financing.  The wind farm is expected to generate about 47 million
kilowatt hours of energy, enough to power about 3,500 homes.  The U.S. federal government aims to get  20 percent  of its
electricity from renewable energy by 2020, up from the current
 7.5 percent .  To contact the reporter on this story:
