China will receive a first spot
cargo of liquefied natural gas from  Angola  LNG delivered by the
Cubal over the weekend, according to ship-tracking data.  The vessel, with a capacity of about 155,000 cubic meters,
is en route to China and scheduled to dock Aug. 18, according to
ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. It
loaded the supercooled gas at Angola LNG’s terminal in Soyo,
northern Angola, July 14, according to a company statement.  China National Offshore Oil Corp., the parent of the
nation’s biggest offshore energy explorer, will take delivery of
the LNG shipment, which was bought by a supplier on its behalf
through a tender last month, a company official said.  The cargo is the second from the Angola natural gas plant,
which started in June, and the first to be tendered, said the
official, who asked not be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak to the media. He declined to say which port
the ship will dock at.  CNOOC has LNG terminals operating in Guangdong, Shanghai,
Fujian, Zhuhai and Ningbo.  China  has no long-term LNG supply
contracts with Angola, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
