Nigeria ’s statistics office said it
plans to release new figures for gross domestic product in
December, after changing the way they are calculated in a move
that will probably boost the reported size of its economy.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, is updating its GDP
base year to 2010 to give a better indication of the size and
composition of its economy. The GDP of Africa’s most populous
nation is currently based on production patterns in 1990.  The data are now slated for publication on  Dec. 10 , the
Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics said today in an e-mailed statement. Yemi Kale, the head of the agency, confirmed
that 2010 will be the new base year, according to an e-mailed
response to questions today. He said in May that the agency was
also considering 2012 as a possible base year, after consulting
experts from inside and outside government.  The schedule for release of the new GDP data has been been
changed several times. While the statistics bureau’s  website 
still mentions a target of Oct. 24, Kale said in May that it may
not happen until next year.  Nigeria’s economy, the second-largest in sub-Saharan
Africa, was estimated at $268.7 billion last year and is
forecast to expand 7.2 percent this year by the  International
Monetary Fund .  The true size and composition of the economy hasn’t been
properly reflected in the annual calculations, which don’t
capture the activities of companies created since 1990,
according to Kale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
