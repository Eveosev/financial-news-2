OMV Petrom SA,  Romania ’s biggest oil
company, said its second-quarter profit rose 65 percent because
of stable production.  Net income advanced to 1.06 billion lei ($319 million) from
643 million lei a year earlier, the Bucharest-based company said
in a  regulatory statement  today. Sales shrank 7 percent to 5.8
billion lei because of lower crude sales volumes and lower
product prices, it said.  “We have further pursued our significant investment
program, which has enabled us to successfully stabilize
production,” Chief Executive Officer Mariana Gheorghe said in
the statement. “We are striving to deliver our ambitious 2013
investment program of more than 1.2 billion euros, while
addressing the challenges in the gas and electricity markets,
and relying on an investment-friendly regulatory and fiscal
framework.”  Petrom’s total hydrocarbon production grew 1 percent in the
second quarter to 184,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from a
year earlier because of higher gas output in Romania, it said.
The crude price environment “remained supportive,” according
to the statement.  Petrom is striving to stabilize its oil and gas production
by redeveloping mature domestic fields and searching for new
offshore resources in the  Black Sea  with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
Spending on exploration totaled 70 million lei in the second
quarter due to the acquisition of seismic data for the Neptun
block in the Black Sea, it said.  Earnings before interest and taxes rose 53 percent to 1.4
billion lei from 909 million lei a year earlier, Petrom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
