Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) ,  India ’s
second-largest aluminum producer, reported a better-than-expected 12 percent increase in first-quarter profit, aided by a
falling rupee and lower raw material costs.  Net income , on a standalone basis and excluding unit
Novelis Inc., rose to 4.74 billion rupees ($77 million), or 2.48
rupees a share, in the three months ended June 30 from 4.25
billion rupees, or 2.22 rupees, a year earlier, the Mumbai-based
company said today in a stock exchange filing. That beat the
3.26 billion rupee median estimate of 27 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Sales at Hindalco, which also produces copper and its
byproducts, fell 3 percent to 57.4 billion rupees, compared with
an estimated 60.2 billion rupees.  Hindalco, which pegs its domestic sales to the dollar-denominated prices of the London Metal Exchange, benefitted as
the rupee sank 8.6 percent against the greenback in the last
quarter. The company’s sales of aluminum gained 7 percent.  Earnings were hampered by lower prices of aluminum and
copper on the London Metal Exchange. Aluminum, the lightweight
metal used to make aircraft and beverage cans, averaged 9
percent lower in the period, while copper fell 8 percent.  “Depressed LME in an otherwise inflationary scenario poses
a significant challenge,” Hindalco said in the exchange filing.
“The focus of the company is now on ramping up of the new
projects already on stream.”  Hindalco  shares  pared losses in Mumbai after the earnings
announcement. They traded at 92.05 rupees as of 2:37 p.m. local
time, down 2.1 percent. The stock has fallen 29 percent this
year, compared with a 1.2 percent drop in the key S&P BSE Sensex.  Total expenses declined 3.5 percent to 55.4 billion rupees,
with raw material costs falling 18 percent to 29.9 billion
rupees.  The company’s Atlanta-based unit Novelis, the world’s
biggest supplier of aluminum to carmakers, posted a 77 percent
drop in net income, excluding tax-affected special items, of $21
million in the quarter ended June 30, compared with $91 million
in the year ago period, according to an investor presentation on
Aug. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
