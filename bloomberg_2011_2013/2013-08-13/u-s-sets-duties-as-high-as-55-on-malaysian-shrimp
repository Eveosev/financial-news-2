Imports of shrimp from  Malaysia  will
be subject to anti-subsidy duties as high as 54.5 percent, the
U.S. Commerce Department said, while lower penalties were set
for similar goods from China, Ecuador,  India  and  Vietnam .  The agency announced final duties today in a statement. It
determined that shrimp imports from Indonesia and Thailand
didn’t receive government support that warranted a tariff to
offset the benefit. A group of U.S. domestic producers, known as
the Coalition of Gulf Shrimp Industries, in December asked the
agency to investigate whether the imports from the seven nations
received unfair support.  The Commerce Department’s decision deals with imports of
“certain frozen warmwater shrimp” from those countries, which
were valued at about $3.5 billion last year, according to the
agency. It doesn’t included breaded, fresh or canned shrimp.  The department set anti-subsidy tariffs on imports of
Chinese shrimp at 18.16 percent. The rates on the goods from
 Ecuador  are as high as 13.51 percent, 11.14 percent for those
from India and 7.88 percent for the shellfish from Vietnam.  While the Commerce Department sets duty rates, the U.S.
International Trade Commission determines whether the imports
have harmed domestic producers. The commission is scheduled to
issue its findings on that issue Sept. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
