by Rita Gunther McGrath and Alex Gourlay  Are you at risk of being trapped in an uncompetitive business? Chances are the strategies that worked well for you even a few years ago no longer deliver the results you need. Dramatic changes in business have unearthed a major gap between traditional approaches to strategy and the way the real world works now. In short, strategy is stuck. Most leaders are using frameworks that were designed for a different era of business and based on a single dominant idea — that the purpose of strategy is to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. This book serves as a new playbook for strategy, one based on updated assumptions about how the world works, and shows how some of the world's most successful companies use this method to compete and win today. How CEOs Can Fix Capitalism 
Edited by Raymond Gilmartin and Steven E. Prokesch  The financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession caused a crisis of public confidence in business and American-style capitalism, with its focus on maximizing shareholder value. Corporate leaders understood that reform was needed and that they needed to commit themselves to the dual goal of producing benefits for society and their firms' bottom lines — to creating "shared value." But the specific actions they could take to bring about this change were less clear. This HBR Single offers some of the freshest thinking today on practical measures that businesses can implement to create shared value.  Work Smarter with LinkedIn

In  Work Smarter with LinkedIn , social media expert Alexandra Samuel demonstrates the most effective ways to actively build and use your network True Story: How to Combine Story and Action to Transform Your Business 
by Ty Montague  Is your company a storyteller — or a storydoer? The old way to market a business was storytelling. But in today's world, simply communicating your brand's story in the hope that customers will listen is no longer enough. Instead, your authentic brand must be evident in every action the organization undertakes. Today's most successful businesses are storydoers. These companies create products and services that, from the very beginning, are manifestations of an authentic and meaningful story — one told primarily through action, not advertising. In  True Story  creative executive Ty Montague argues that any business, regardless of size or industry, can embrace the principles of storydoing. The book is filled with examples of how forward-thinking organizations — including Red Bull, Shaklee, Grind, TOMS Shoes, and News Corporation — are effectively using storydoing to transform their organizations.
