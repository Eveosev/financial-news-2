OAO Rosneft, the world’s biggest
publicly traded crude producer, and State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan
signed an agreement today in Baku on oil supplies.  The accord, which didn’t specify volumes, was signed in the
presence of Russian President  Vladimir Putin  and his Azeri
counterpart Ilham Aliyev. They also signed an agreement on
cooperation.  Rosneft has signed supply deals with companies including
China National Petroleum Corp., Glencore International Plc and
Vitol Group since completing the $55 billion acquisition of
Anglo-Russian TNK-BP in March. Russia has been seeking to expand
its economic influence in former Soviet republics.  Azerbaijan is the third-biggest oil exporter in the former
 Soviet Union , after Russia and Kazakhstan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
