Private-equity firm Kohlberg & Co.
said it waived the right to negotiate with  Steinway Musical
Instruments Inc. (LVB) ’s board after the 160-year-old piano maker
received a superior offer from an unidentified bidder.  Kohlberg has withdrawn “with respect to the new proposal
and any other proposal at the same or higher price than the new
proposal,” according to a company filing today.  The new offer of $38 a share in cash would value the
company at $475 million and is higher than Kohlberg’s $35-a-share bid. It came from an affiliate of an investment firm with
more than $15 billion under management, Waltham, Massachusetts-based Steinway said yesterday in a statement, without naming the
bidder.  Kohlberg’s offer, disclosed last month, would have valued
the maker of grand pianos at about $438 million. The agreement
included a 45-day period where Steinway could solicit
alternative proposals.  Steinway fell 3 percent to $38.41 at 9:42 a.m. in  New York .
The shares had gained 87 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
