Implenia AG (IMPN) ,  Switzerland ’s largest
builder, gained the most in six weeks after announcing almost
120 million Swiss francs ($129 million) of orders for projects
including residential homes for the elderly.  Implenia jumped as much as 5.4 percent to 54.70 francs,
the biggest intraday advance since June 21. The stock was up 4.1
percent at 54.05 francs as of 11:45 a.m. in Zurich, giving the
Dietlikon-based company a market value of 998.4 million francs.  “Today’s news confirms our positive case which is based on
good growth and profitability improvement prospects,” Christian Arnold, an analyst with Bank Vontobel AG in Zurich, said in a
note to investors today. Implenia has “an unwarranted valuation
discount to its European peers,” said Arnold, who recommends
buying the shares.  Implenia received the  orders  for the three separate Swiss
projects in Muttenz, Islikon and Geneva in the last couple of
weeks, spokesman Philipp Bircher said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
