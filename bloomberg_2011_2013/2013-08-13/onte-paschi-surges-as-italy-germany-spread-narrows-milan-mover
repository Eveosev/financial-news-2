Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA ,
the bailed-out Italian bank, rose the most in four months,
leading gainers on the benchmark FTSE MIB Index, after Italy’s
10-year yield premium over benchmark German bunds shrank to the
least in two years.  The country’s third-largest bank rose as much as 9.7
percent, the biggest gain since April 10, and was up 7.5 percent
at 22.5 cents as of 3:55 p.m. in Milan. That gives the Siena,
Italy-based bank a market value of 2.61 billion euros ($3.5
billion). The FTSE MIB rose 0.2 percent.  Monte Paschi is the most exposed lender in the country to
Italy’s sovereign debt, holding about 29 billion euros of bonds
at the end of June, more than three times its tangible capital.
Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Viola is trying to revive
profit after acquisitions, investments in sovereign debt and
derivatives hurt capital. Paschi posted its fifth straight
quarterly loss in the second quarter.  Italy ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 4.16 percent,
while benchmark German rates climbed eight basis points to 1.79
percent, narrowing the difference to 237 basis points, the least
since July 2011.
