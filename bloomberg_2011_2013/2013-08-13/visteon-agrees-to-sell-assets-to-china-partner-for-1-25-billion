Visteon Corp. (VC)  agreed to sell Chinese
assets for $1.25 billion to focus on its automotive climate-control and electronics businesses.  Visteon will sell its 50 percent stake in a venture with
 Huayu Automotive Systems Co. (600741)  and other assets to the Chinese
partner, the Van Buren Township, Michigan-based company said in
a statement today. Visteon will use most of the proceeds to buy
back stock until the end of 2015, Chief Executive Officer Tim Leuliette said in the statement.  Visteon, spun off from Ford Motor Co. in 2000, has tried to
dispose of lower-margin units to focus on faster-growing Asian
operations after exiting bankruptcy in 2010. Leuliette, formerly
part of a bloc of Visteon directors who favored revamping the
company, became CEO last year after the company failed to
generate consistent profits.  Visteon also agreed to pay about $70 million to gain
control of an electronics venture with Huayu called Yanfeng
Visteon Automotive Electronics Co., it said. The deals will
probably be completed by June 2015, Visteon said.  Huayu Automotive is a unit of Shanghai Automotive Industry
Corp.  Last year, Visteon said it would reorganize its climate-control business, sell its interiors unit and consider options
for its electronics business.  Visteon rose 4.3 percent to $71.99 at 9:55 a.m.  New York 
time, after surging as much as 7.1 percent to $73.92, the
biggest intraday gain in more than nine months. The shares
climbed 28 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a
19 percent increase for the Russell 1000 Index.  Rothschild Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP advised Visteon.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
