China’s refiners produced the most
 diesel  in four months even as they face fewer opportunities to
export the fuel because of government curbs.  Production rose to 14.5 million metric tons in July, up 3.9
percent from the previous month, according to data from the
National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing today. That’s
equivalent to 3.52 million barrels a day and is the highest
volume since March.  China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer, may
stockpile more diesel as refiners are barred from increasing
overseas sales. China National Petroleum Corp. and  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)  last month were granted a combined
210,000 tons of diesel-export quotas for the third quarter, less
than the monthly average of 250,000 to 300,000 tons for the
first quarter, according to ICIS-C1 Energy, a Shanghai-based
energy consultant.  “We may see less diesel exported in July as lower quotas
are granted to refiners for the third quarter,” Jean Zou, an
oil analyst at ICIS-C1, said by phone from Guangzhou. “Diesel
stockpiles may rise further from June.”  Diesel inventories increased 2.8 percent in June from the
previous month to an estimated 9.2 million tons, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on data from China Oil, Gas and
Petrochemicals, a newsletter published by the official Xinhua
News Agency. That was the first gain in four months.  China ’s gasoline output in July climbed 1.2 percent from
June to 8.14 million tons, while fuel oil production declined
9.1 percent to 2 million tons, today’s data show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
