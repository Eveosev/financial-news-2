Brian Baker , who is working his way
back from a knee injury sustained at the Australian Open, is one
of eight players to get wild-card entries into the men’s singles
draw for the U.S. Open tennis tournament.  Ryan Harrison , a member of the U.S. team at the 2012 London
Olympics, also received an at-large spot, along with Bradley
Klahn, who was the 2010 college tennis champion as a sophomore
at  Stanford University ; fellow Americans Rhyne Williams, Collin
Altamirano and Rajeev Ram; Australia’s James Duckworth; and
France’s Guillaume Rufin.  Baker, 28, tore the lateral meniscus in his right knee
during a second-round match in Melbourne in January. It was the
latest injury for Baker, who had climbed to 52nd in the world
rankings in 2012 after five major operations, including three
hip procedures, sidelined him from professional tennis for
almost six years.  Baker, No. 185 in the latest world rankings, returned to
competitive play during last week’s U.S. Tennis Association Pro
Circuit Challenger event in Aptos, California, and has reached
the second round of this week’s Western & Southern Open in
Cincinnati.  The  U.S. Open , the last of the sport’s four annual major
championships, is scheduled for Aug. 26 to Sept. 9 at the
National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
