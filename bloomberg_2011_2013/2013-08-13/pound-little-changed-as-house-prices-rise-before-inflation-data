U.K. government bonds fell, pushing
10-year yields to the highest since October 2011, as reports
showing inflation stayed above the central bank’s target and
house prices rose sapped demand for fixed-income assets.  Ten-year yields jumped by the most in seven weeks before
the  Bank of England  releases the minutes of its July 31-Aug. 1
policy meeting tomorrow. A market gauge of  inflation
expectations  over the next five years climbed from the lowest in
a month as investors bet consumer prices will keep rising. U.K.
10-year gilts underperformed all similar-maturity developed-market bonds, according to data from 24 sovereigns compiled by
Bloomberg. The pound rose to a five-week high versus the euro.  “There’s clear evidence that growth is here, looking at
economic surveys, inflation growth and house-price inflation,”
said  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-market debt strategy at
ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “That’s all negative for gilts.”  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield increased 14 basis points,
or 0.14 percentage point, to 2.60 percent at the 5 p.m. close of
trading in London after reaching 2.61 percent, the highest since
Oct. 28, 2011. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in September 2022
fell 1.045, or 10.45 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,546) face
amount, to 93.195.  The annual  inflation  rate fell to 2.8 percent in July from
2.9 percent in June, a government report showed, still above the
central bank’s 2 percent target. An index of U.K. house prices
climbed to 36 from 21 in June, the highest since November 2006,
the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors  said in a report.  Inflation Outlook  The five-year  break-even rate , a gauge of expectations for
inflation derived from the yield difference between regular and
index-linked bonds, widened five basis points to 2.7 percentage
points. It dropped to 2.64 percentage points yesterday, the
lowest since July 2.  Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  said when releasing
the central bank’s quarterly Inflation Report on Aug. 7 that
officials probably won’t raise the benchmark  interest rate  from
a record-low 0.5 percent until unemployment falls to 7 percent.
The plan includes a number of caveats, including two that are
linked to inflation.  “The data has certainly been on a good run and the house-price data does suggest that the market is gaining in
strength,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in London. “The gilt market is certainly
reacting to that but there are plenty more data points to come
in the next few days, which could be equally instructive.”  Jobless Claims  The number of Britons claiming jobless benefits fell for a
ninth month in July, according to a Bloomberg survey before the
 Office for National Statistics  releases the number tomorrow.  U.K. gilts lost investors 3.5 percent this year through
yesterday, Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show. German securities
dropped 1.4 percent and Treasuries declined 2.6 percent.  The pound rose 0.3 percent to 85.73 pence per euro after
appreciating to 85.35, the strongest level since July 4. The
U.K. currency was little changed at $1.5453.  Sterling has gained 1 percent in the past month, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The euro was little changed, while
the dollar weakened 1.5 percent.  The yield on U.K. 10-year bonds increased relative to all
23 of their developed-market peers, Bloomberg data show. The
premium investors demand to hold gilts over German bunds widened
three basis points to 79 basis points, while the spread of
Italian bonds over their U.K. equivalents narrowed seven basis
points to 163 basis points.  Short-sterling futures declined as investors bet the
central bank will have to raise interest rates to counter
inflation. The implied yield on the contract expiring in
September 2016 increased 15 basis points to 1.99 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
