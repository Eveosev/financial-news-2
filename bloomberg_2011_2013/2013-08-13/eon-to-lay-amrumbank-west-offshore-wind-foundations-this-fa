EON SE,  Germany ’s biggest utility,
will start laying wind-turbine foundations for the company’s 1
billion-euro ($1.3 billion)  Amrumbank West  offshore farm this
fall, Chief Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen said.  EON will also “in the coming days” start building an
offshore wind service center on the North Sea island of
Helgoland, Teyssen said today on a call with reporters. The 288-megawatt Amrumbank West farm is scheduled to start producing in
the summer of 2015.  Offshore wind projects by utilities including EON and  RWE
AG (RWE)  have been set back by delays in linking turbines to the
mainland grid. EON said in March it will lower clean-energy
investments to less than 1 billion euros in 2015 from 1.79
billion euros last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
