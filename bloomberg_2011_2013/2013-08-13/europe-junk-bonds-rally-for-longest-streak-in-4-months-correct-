(Corrects borrowing cost decline in first paragraph.)  Junk-rated corporate bonds in Europe
rose for a 12th day, the longest stretch of gains since April
15, pushing borrowing costs down to a 2 1/2-month low.  The average yield investors demand to hold high-yield bonds
in euros fell to 4.6 percent, the lowest since May 31, according
to Bloomberg index  data . The cost of insuring the debt declined,
with the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of default swaps on 50
speculative-grade companies falling 4.9 basis points to 393
basis points at 9:15 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
