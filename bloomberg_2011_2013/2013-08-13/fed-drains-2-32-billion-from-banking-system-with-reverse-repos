The  Federal Reserve  drained $2.32
billion in  reserves  from the banking system with reverse-repurchase agreements as policy makers prepare for the eventual
withdrawal of monetary stimulus.  The one-day Treasury transaction, part of a series of
temporary open-market operations that began in 2009, didn’t
signal any change in monetary policy, according to a  statement 
posted Aug. 5 on the Fed Bank of New York’s website.  The Fed uses repos and reverse repos to help maintain the
level of money in the banking system to keep overnight  interest
rates  close to its target. The central bank has held the target
rate for overnight loans between banks in a range of zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties.  In a tri-party arrangement, a third party functions as the
agent for the transaction and holds the security as collateral.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. are the
only banks that serve in a trade-clearing capacity in the tri-party repo market.  The central bank’s large-scale asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing, have swelled its  balance sheet  to more than
$3.5 trillion, as policy makers have sought to reduce borrowing
costs and stimulate growth. Fed officials have listed tri-party
reverse repos as one tool they will use when they begin to drain
cash in the banking system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
