JVB Financial Group LLC opened a New
York office and hired at least three people to sell and catalog
its structured-note offerings.  Kevin Geiger, formerly of  Citigroup Inc. (C) , and Andy Strauss,
of shuttered SIP America LLC, joined the firm to sell the
securities, said John Tessar, senior vice president at the
brokerage in Boca Raton,  Florida . Tessar said they both report
to him. Geiger and Strauss confirmed the details of their
positions when reached by telephone.  The new office “positions us to more thoroughly cover the
large number of customers we work with in the Northeast,”
Tessar said in an e-mail.  Neil Condon, former head of research at
StructuredRetailProducts.com, an industry database owned by
 Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc (ERM) , was hired to build a
repository of structured note offerings, Tessar said. Condon
declined to comment when reached.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
