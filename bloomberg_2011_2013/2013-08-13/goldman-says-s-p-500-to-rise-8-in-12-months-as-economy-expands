(Corrects percent change in fourth paragraph of story
published yesterday.)  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  will
climb 8 percent to 1,825 in the next 12 months as economic
growth gains momentum, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  David Kostin , the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist,
recommends buying shares of companies that generate most of
their revenue domestically. The S&P 500 increased today as data
showed retail sales increased for a fourth consecutive month, a
sign that American households are boosting spending as
employment climbs.  “The real issue to focus on is that rising interest rates
are a reflection of a better economy,” Kostin said in a
Bloomberg Television interview from New York. “The best
strategy right now would be here, in the U.S., from now until
the end of the year.”  U.S. equity strategists were too cautious on the rally at
the beginning of the year, spurring forecasters from Goldman
Sachs to Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG to
boost year-end targets as the  S&P 500  surged to highs. Current
predictions indicate the index will retreat 1 percent to 1,677
by December, the average from a survey of 17 strategists
compiled by Bloomberg.  Kostin estimates the S&P 500 will finish 2013 at 1,750 and
2014 at 1,900. The gauge rose 0.3 percent to 1,694.16 at 4 p.m.
New York time today, bringing its advance this year to 19
percent.  Federal Open Market Committee policy makers have been
debating the pace and timing of any cuts in the monetary
stimulus that has helped propel the S&P 500 more than 150
percent from its bear-market low in 2009. The central bank has
said economic data will determine any reduction in its $85
billion in monthly asset purchases.  The S&P 500 trades at 16.3 times reported operating
earnings, near the highest level since May 2010. The  valuation 
is still 16 percent below the average since 1998, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
