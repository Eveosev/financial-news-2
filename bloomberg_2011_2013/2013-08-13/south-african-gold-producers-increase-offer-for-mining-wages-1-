South African gold producers raised
their offer for wages at mines by a half a percentage point to
5.5 percent, with additional compensation to resolve a deadlock
in negotiations with workers.  “It is envisaged that each of the companies will develop a
‘gain share’ proposal in line with the company’s objectives and
maturity,” the Chamber of Mines, which represents the
producers, said in a statement. The measure may result in an
additional 1 percent increase in basic wages, it said.  Talks about wages stalled on July 24 after the unions
rejected an offer of 5 percent raises and a housing-related
allowance. The dispute moved to mediation at the country’s
Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. That
process can last as long as 30 days.  In order for a settlement to be reached by Aug. 24, the
expiration date for the facilitation process, all parties must
make “major concessions,” Solidarity General Secretary Gideon
du Plessis said in a statement.  “The employers will have to offer more than what is
budgeted for, and unions will have to get a mandate to demand
less than what our members’ current expectations are, to avoid a
strike,” he said.  The chamber represents companies including  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the world’s third-largest producer,  Gold Fields
Ltd. (GFI) ,  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR)  Ltd. and  Sibanye Gold Ltd. (SGL)   The National Union of Mineworkers have asked for a 60
percent increase in wages for entry-level jobs. The labor group
represents 64 percent of employees in the gold sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
