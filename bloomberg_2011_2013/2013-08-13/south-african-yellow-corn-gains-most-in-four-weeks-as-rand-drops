South African yellow-corn futures
rose the most in four weeks in Johannesburg as the rand slumped
against the dollar, making imports of the grain more expensive.  Yellow corn for delivery in September added 1.3 percent,
the most since July 16, to 2,134 rand ($213) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange. The white variety
for delivery in December gained 1.5 percent to 2,337 rand a ton.  The rand weakened for a second day and South African bond
yields rose to a seven-week high following the death of a worker
at  Lonmin Plc (LON) ’s Marikana mine. That raised concern among
investors because only about a year has passed since at least 44
people died in violence at the site.  “What contributed today was the weaker  exchange rate ,
which gave a rise to the prices,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst
at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn,
also called maize. Yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed ,
while the white variety is used to make one of the nation’s
staple foods.  Wheat for delivery in December rose for a third session in
four, adding 0.3 percent to 3,338 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
