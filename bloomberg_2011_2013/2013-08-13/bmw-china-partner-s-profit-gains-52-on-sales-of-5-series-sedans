Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s
Chinese partner reported first-half profit surged 52 percent on
demand for new models including its 5-series sedan in the
world’s largest auto market.  Net income at  Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (1114) 
rose to 2.03 billion  yuan  ($332 million) from 1.33 billion yuan,
the company said yesterday in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. Sales fell 8.5 percent to 2.57 billion yuan.  BMW has said  China  will probably surpass the U.S. as its
top market this year as the brand enters more communities and
wins buyers with its 3- and 5-series sedans. The automaker,
which trails  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi in China, has grown faster
than its competitor for at least four straight years since 2009.  “BMW Brilliance has taken a vital role in helping China
surpass the  United States  to become BMW’s single largest world
market in 2013 in terms of sale volume,” Brilliance Chairman Wu Xiaoan said in the statement. “The joint venture will continue
to execute its capacity expansion plans.”  Brilliance gained 1.3 percent to close at HK$10.66 in Hong
Kong yesterday before the announcement, extending the company’s
gains this year to 12 percent. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index 
rose 1.2 percent yesterday.  China’s environmental protection ministry last month sent
back an application by BMW Brilliance to expand production
capacity at their assembly plant in Shenyang, citing inadequate
wastewater analysis and the plan’s failure to meet anti-pollution targets.  Brilliance has resubmitted documents to the environment
ministry and doesn’t expect its plan to expand capacity to be
affected, Wu said in an earnings briefing in Hong Kong
yesterday.  Vehicle Recall  Earlier this month, BMW Brilliance issued a recall for
143,215 vehicles in China for power steering faults, according
to the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection
and Quarantine.  Brilliance, which assembles the 3- and 5-series sedans and
X1 SUVs, said deliveries increased 31 percent in the first six
months of the year to 105,692 units. BMW deliveries in China --
including vehicles shipped from  Germany  -- climbed 18 percent to
214,994 vehicles in the first seven months of this year,
according to company data.  The first new-energy model for Zinoro, Brilliance’s joint
venture brand with BMW, will be sold in China by the end of the
year, according to yesterday’s statement.  The company plans to introduce a hybrid version of the 5-series sedan next year, Wu said.  BMW Brilliance is also planning to add more BMW models for
local production to widen its reach in China and expanding its
dealer network, which exceeded 380 outlets as of June 30,
according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
