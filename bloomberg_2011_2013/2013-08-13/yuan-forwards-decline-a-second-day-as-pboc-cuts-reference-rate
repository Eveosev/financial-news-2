Yuan  forwards dropped for a second
day after the central bank lowered the currency’s reference rate
for the first time in more than a week as the dollar extended
gains against some of the world’s major currencies.  The People’s Bank of China cut the  daily fixing  0.06
percent to 6.1705 against the U.S. currency, ending the longest
run of increases since November. The PBOC added funds to the
financial system via an issue of 11 billion yuan ($1.8 billion)
of seven-day reverse-repurchase agreements today, according to a
statement on its website.  “The yuan weakens as onshore liquidity has become less
tight and as the dollar rebounds,” said Stella Lee, president
of Success Wealth Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. “It’s still a
negative on Chinese exports if the yuan is too strong.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.06 percent to
6.2655 against the greenback as of 4:42 p.m. in Hong Kong,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts traded at
a 2.3 percent  discount  to the spot rate in  Shanghai , which
closed at 6.1217 from yesterday’s 6.1223, according to China
Foreign Exchange Trade System prices.  The spot reached 6.1143 on Aug. 8, the strongest level
since the government unified the official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993. The yuan has advanced 1.8 percent
against the dollar this year, the best performance among Asia’s
11 most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks 10 of the
world’s major currencies, has gained 0.7 percent in two days on
speculation a pickup in U.S. data, such as retail sales and
manufacturing due this week, will bolster the case for the
Federal Reserve to scale back asset purchases.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan traded at 6.1197
per dollar, compared with 6.1205 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility in the
onshore yuan, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.18 percent. The gauge touched 1.16
percent, the lowest level since October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
