New Zealand will be without fly-half
 Dan Carter  for the opening matches of its southern hemisphere
rugby championship defense because of a calf injury.  Carter, the leading points scorer in elite Test matches,
has a calf strain that will rule him out for as many as four
weeks, the All Blacks said on their website. New Zealand faces
Australia on Aug. 17 and 24 before hosting Argentina on Sept. 7.  Aaron Cruden, who helped New Zealand’s Chiefs win back-to-back Super Rugby titles on Aug. 3, will start at fly-half
against the Wallabies in Sydney in four days with Beauden
Barrett the back-up, All Blacks coach  Steve Hansen  said.  Carter, 31, said last week that he’ll take a six-month
break from the sport next year in a bid to play at the 2015
 Rugby World Cup . He was ruled out of the final stages of the
2011 edition because of a groin injury and also missed matches
last year because of a calf problem.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
