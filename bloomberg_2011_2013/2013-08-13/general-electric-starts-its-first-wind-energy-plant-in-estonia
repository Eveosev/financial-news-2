General Electric Co. (GE)  today started
its first wind farm in  Estonia .  The company installed 18 turbines totaling 45 megawatts in
northwestern Estonia for Eesti Energia AS and Nelja Energia AS,
it said today in a  statement  on its website. Eesti Energia
currently operates four wind farms with a combined capacity of
111 megawatts.  Estonia in 2011 became the first European Union member  to
exceed  its 2020 renewable energy target. The nation’s share of
renewable energy in final energy consumption reached 25.9
percent in 2011, surpassing its 25 percent target.  Wind energy at the end of last year produced about 5.5
percent of Estonia’s total electricity consumption, according to
the  Estonian Wind Power Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
