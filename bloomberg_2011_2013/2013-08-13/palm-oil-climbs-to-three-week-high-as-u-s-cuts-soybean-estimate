Palm oil  rallied to the highest
level in more than three weeks after the U.S. cut its forecast
for the soybean crop, more than analysts expected, spurring a
rally in the oilseed that can be crushed to produce an
alternative oil.  The contract for October delivery gained as much as 2.3
percent to 2,294 ringgit ($705) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price for most active futures
since July 19, and ended the morning session at 2,282 ringgit.
Palm oil for local physical delivery in August was at 2,310
ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Farmers in the U.S., the world’s biggest soybeans producer
and shipper, will  harvest  3.26 billion bushels this year, down
from 3.42 billion estimated last month and 3.357 billion
forecast by analysts, after excessive rain in May and June
reduced planted acreage and damaged yields, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said yesterday.  “Smaller soybean supplies will probably drive prices
upwards given the correlation between  soybean oil  and palm
oil,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst with Alliance Investment Bank
Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “On the demand side, there could be some
switching if there is insufficient soybean oil supplies as palm
oil is very cheap right now.”  Exports from Malaysia jumped 18 percent to 417,414 tons
during in the first 10 days of this month from the same period
in July, Intertek said yesterday. Palm is $252.54 a ton cheaper
than soybean oil today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Soybean oil for delivery in December advanced 1.2 percent
to 43.27 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans
for November rose 0.7 percent to $12.3375 a bushel, extending a
3.6 percent gain yesterday.  Refined palm oil for January delivery climbed 2.9 percent
to 5,570  yuan  ($910) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil advanced 2.4 percent to 7,144 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
