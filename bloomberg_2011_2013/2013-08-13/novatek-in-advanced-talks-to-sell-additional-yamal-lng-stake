(Corrects Mikhelson’s title in last paragraph of story
published yesterday.)  OAO Novatek is in “advanced” talks
to sell a stake in its Yamal liquefied natural gas development
to a group of companies after earlier agreeing to a preliminary
deal to offer 20 percent to China National Petroleum Corp.  “Hopefully in the near term we will have positive news to
report in terms of additional equity stake,” Chief Financial
Officer Mark Gyetvay told analysts today on a call, without
disclosing the names of the companies or any timeframe.  Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest natural-gas producer after
OAO Gazprom, is building the $20 billion Yamal LNG project in
the Russian Arctic. It agreed to sell the stake to CNPC in June
after previously adding  Total SA (FP)  as a strategic partner, also
with 20 percent. Novatek is ready to cut its holding to as low
as 51 percent if potential partners offer markets for the gas.  The CNPC deal, which also stipulates the sale of at least 3
million metric tons of LNG a year, will be completed by October.  The final  investment decision  on the project is expected in
the third quarter or start of the fourth quarter, and marketing
of the remaining LNG volumes is “well advanced,” Gyetvay said.
“Demand for offtake has been pretty strong,” he said.  Novatek plans to secure agreements to supply LNG to  Asia 
this year after signing the accord with CNPC, Chief Executive
Officer Leonid Mikhelson said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
