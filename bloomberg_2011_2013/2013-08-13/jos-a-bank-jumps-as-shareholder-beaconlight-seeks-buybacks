Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc. (JOSB) , the
century-old retailer of men’s apparel, rose the most in more
than 11 months after shareholder BeaconLight Capital LLC called
the company undervalued and urged share repurchases.  The stock  climbed  12 percent to $45.33 at the close in New
York, for the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 29, 2012. The
Hampstead, Maryland-based company’s shares have gained 6.5
percent this year, compared with a 19 percent gain in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  BeaconLight, which owns about 300,000 shares, or 1.1
percent of the company’s stock and options outstanding, urged
the retailer to end the “hoarding” of cash by repurchasing
shares, in a letter to today. The company should also terminate
a consulting agreement with Robert Wildrick, the company’s non-executive chairman, according to the missive.  “We have received a lot of shareholder response, all of
which is supportive,” Ed Bosek, a managing member of New York-based hedge fund BeaconLight, said in a phone interview. “I
think there’s a lot of frustrated shareholders who are afraid to
own the stock in larger size.”  Jos. A. Bank had about $377 million in cash at the end of
the fiscal year ended January 2013, according to the letter. The
retailer hasn’t yet responded to the letter, Bosek said.  David Ullman, Jos. A. Bank’s chief financial officer,
didn’t  immediately respond to a message requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
