Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) ,  India ’s
largest maker of tractors and sport-utility vehicles, reported
first-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates as rising
demand for  farm equipment  boosted sales.  Net income , excluding units, increased to 9.38 billion
rupees ($153 million) in the three months ended June from 7.26
billion rupees, the Mumbai-based company said today. That
surpassed the 8.5 billion-rupee median of 39  analysts’ estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose to 99 billion rupees from 92.5
billion rupees.  Mahindra, which gets about 30 percent of its revenue from
 farm equipment , is counting on higher agriculture output to spur
demand. The July-September rainy season, the main source of
irrigation for India’s 235 million farmers, had its best start
since 1994, according to the weather office.  Mahindra, up as much as 4.3 percent before earnings, pared
gains after reporting results. The stock traded at 881.90 rupees
at 1:43 p.m. in Mumbai trading, up 2.4 percent. The benchmark
S&P BSE Sensex rose 1.1 percent.  Domestic sales of tractors increased 26 percent to 71,390
units in the quarter, compared with a decline in the year-earlier period, according to company data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
