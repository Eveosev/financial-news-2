A man died at Turner Field in
Atlanta after falling from the upper deck before last night’s
Major League Baseball game between the Braves and Philadelphia
Phillies, police said.  The man was taken to Atlanta Medical Center, where he died
of his injuries after plunging approximately 65 feet (20 meters)
from an upper level platform to a parking lot below,
Atlanta Police Department spokesman John Chafee said.  There’s no indication of foul play and the fall appears
accidental, Chafee said in an e-mail. The victim’s identity
hasn’t been released.  The start of last night’s game was delayed an hour and 48
minutes by rain.  In May 2008, a 25-year-old man died from head injuries
after he fell 150 feet from the upper deck concourse at Turner
Field. Police said alcohol was a factor in that incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
