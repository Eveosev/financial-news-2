Elbit Systems Ltd. (ESLT)  rose the most in
four months as the Israeli defense developer grew its order
backlog and boosted sales, driving second-quarter profit 30
percent higher.  Shares of the Haifa-based company jumped 3.7 percent, the
most since April 10, to 162.80 shekels at the close in Tel Aviv.
They had earlier surged as much as 5.3 percent. The stock was
the biggest gainer in percentage terms on Israel’s benchmark
 TA-25 Index (TA-25) , which rose 0.4 percent.  Profit rose to $50 million as sales climbed 4 percent to
$703 million, Elbit said in a statement today. The order backlog
grew for a fifth consecutive quarter, rising to $5.8 billion,
even as global defense budgets are cut, it said. The company is
seeking to stay competitive by boosting its focus on advanced
defense electronics and optics, Chief Executive Officer Bezhalel Machlis said in a Bloomberg interview today.  “We are seeing now the results of years of preparation in
making the company more efficient, in evaluating where the
market is going and what the needs of our clients will be,”Machlis said in an interview today at Elbit’s  Tel Aviv  office.  Global  defense spending  contracted for the first time in 15
years last year as U.S. and European cuts exceeded rising
outlays in China and  Russia , the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute said in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
