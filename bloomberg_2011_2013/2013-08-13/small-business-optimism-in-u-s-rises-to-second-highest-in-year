Confidence among U.S. small
businesses improved in July to its second-highest level in a
year as managers became less pessimistic about sales.  The  National Federation of Independent Business ’s  optimism
index  increased to 94.1 last month from 93.5 in June. A May
reading of 94.4 matched the highest since April 2012. Six of the
measure’s 10 components contributed to the rise, the Washington-based group said.  The net share of business owners expecting  sales to
increase  rose by 2 percentage points to 7 percent in July. That
was still short of the average during the previous expansion of
21. More companies also said it was a good time to  expand .  At the same time, the number of companies planning to
increase their  inventories  was little changed from the month
prior. There was more pessimism about the  outlook  for the
economy, as a gauge of expectations about business conditions
fell for the first time since November.  “Sales for small businesses, especially at service firms,
continue to languish,”  William Dunkelberg , the group’s chief
economist, said in a statement. Plans to create new jobs
improved “in spite of pessimistic views of future sales growth,
but were still historically low, not typical of periods of
economic growth.”  The NFIB report was based on a survey of 1,615 small-business owners through July 30. Small companies represent more
than 99 percent of all U.S employers, according to the U.S.
Small Business Administration. A small business is defined as an
independent enterprise with no more than 500 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
