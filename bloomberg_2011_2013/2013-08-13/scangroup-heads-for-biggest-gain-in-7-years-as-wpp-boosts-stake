Scangroup Ltd., East Africa’s
biggest marketing agency by sales, made the biggest one-day gain
since 2006 after London-based  WPP Plc (WPP)  made an offer to increase
its stake.  The stock surged 12 percent to 72 shillings by the close in
Nairobi, the capital, the largest advance since September 2006.
Trading volume was 20 percent of the three-month daily average.
WPP, the world’s biggest communications company, will increase
its holding in Scangroup to 50.1 percent from 33.62 percent, the
companies said yesterday.  “There is a lot of attention on the African advertising
segment,” Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan
Capital Ltd., said by phone. Industry “growth right now is on
digital advertising and market research and WPP will benefit
from this.”  Under the transaction, companies including Ogilvy Africa
Ltd. and Hill & Knowlton  East Africa  Ltd. will become wholly
owned units of Scangroup, according to the Kenyan company’s
statement.  Shares in Scangroup have underperformed the FTSE NSE 25
Share Index this year, gaining 5.1 percent, compared with the
gauge’s 30 percent  climb .  To contact the reporter on this story:
