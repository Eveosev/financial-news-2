Algeria issued an international
arrest warrant for former Energy Minister  Chakib Khelil  for his
alleged role in a bribery scandal involving national  oil company 
Sonatrach, according to the state-run APS news agency.  Eight other warrants were issued including for Khelil’s
wife, his two sons and Farid Bedjaoui, nephew of the former
minister of foreign affairs, APS said, citing the general
prosecutor of the Algiers Court, Belkacem Zeghmati.  The group is suspected of corruption, abuse of office,
money laundering and procurement, Zeghmati said. The warrants
came into force two weeks ago, he told APS.  Khelil was oil minister from 1999 to 2010 and president of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008. He
has been working as an independent energy consultant in the
U.S., and says his doctor has said he’s unable to travel for the
next two months, according to Zeghmati.  Algeria , a member of OPEC, pumped 1.12 million barrels of
oil a day in July, making it the ninth-largest producer among
the group’s 12 members, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
