Level 3 Financing Inc. (LVLT) , a unit of
the U.S. telecommunications company with operations in 55
countries, is seeking a $595.5 billion  term loan  due in 2020 to
repay bank debt that comes due in 2016, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley,
Credit Suisse Group AG, Jefferies Group Inc., and JPMorgan Chase
& Co. are arranging the financing and will host a lender meeting
at 10:30 a.m. today in New York, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the information is private.  Level 3, based in Broomfield,  Colorado , yesterday said it
refinanced an $815 million term portion at 3 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate with a 1 percent
minimum on the lending benchmark, down from 3.75 percentage
points more than Libor with a 1.5 percent floor.  The companyâ€™s debt due in 2016 currently pays interest at
3.25 percentage points more than Libor with a 1.5 percent
minimum on the lending benchmark, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Lenders to the new financing will have to let the banks
know by 5 p.m. tomorrow if they will participate in the deal,
the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
