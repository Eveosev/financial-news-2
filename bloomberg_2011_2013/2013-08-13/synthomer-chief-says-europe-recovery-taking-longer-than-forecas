Synthomer Plc (SYNT) , the world’s leading
maker of nitrile rubber used in medical gloves, said there are
very few signs of recovery in Europe, and the company will push
ahead with plans for expansion in  emerging markets .  The current slowdown in construction markets in Europe is
denting demand for polymers and dispersions used in paints and
adhesives, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Whitfield said in an
interview today. “I would expect analysts to reduce their
expectations for European demand” and to cut full-year
estimates for profit as a result, he said.  Synthomer is making savings to buoy results as it
completes the integration of a latex business bought from
TowerBrook Capital in 2011 for almost $600 million. The market
for nitrile latex gloves remains “healthy,” Whitfield said, as
synthetic gloves more resistant to oil and chemicals gain ground
on natural-rubber ones.  First-half underlying pretax profit fell 10 percent to 48.6
million pounds ($75 million), as sales declined 7.5 percent to
558.3 million pounds, the Harlow, England-based company said in
a statement today.  Synthomer’s shares fell 0.9 percent to 204.1 pence as of
9:39 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
