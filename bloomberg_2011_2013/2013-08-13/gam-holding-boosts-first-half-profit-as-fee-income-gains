GAM Holding AG (GAM) , the asset manager
that split from  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  almost four years ago,
said first-half profit more than tripled after fee and
commission income increased.  Net income rose to 117.5 million Swiss francs ($127
million) from 36.6 million francs a year earlier, Zurich-based
GAM Holding said today in a financial report on its website. Net
management fees and commissions climbed 14 percent to 279
million francs.  “Investors are reassessing their portfolio allocations,
preferring alternative fixed income strategies” and “slowly
but steadily” regaining their appetite for equity investments,
Chief Executive Officer David Solo said in a statement.  Earnings were boosted after the sale of GAM Holding’s
minority stake in Artio Global Investors Inc. to  Aberdeen Asset
Management Plc (ADN)  in May resulted in a one-time gain of 13.1
million francs. Assets under management dropped 2 percent to
116.6 billion francs at the end of the period from the end of
March after a “sharp market correction” in June, the firm
said. Clients withdrew 600 million francs in the first half of
the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
