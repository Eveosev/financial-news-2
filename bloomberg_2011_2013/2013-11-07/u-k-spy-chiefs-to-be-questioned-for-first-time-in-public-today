A total of 34 terrorist plots have
been disrupted in the U.K. since the July 2005 bombings in
 London , the head of the domestic security service said.  “There have been persistent attempts of attacks of
terrorism in this country,” Andrew Parker, the director general
of the agency known as  MI5 , told Parliament’s cross-party
Intelligence and Security Committee in London today. “A small
number have failed because they just failed, the plans didn’t
come together, but the vast majority were foiled.”  One or two of the plots that have failed each year were
aimed at causing mass casualties, Parker said, adding that the
“vast majority” emanated from British residents.  Parker and his colleagues from Britain’s two other spy
agencies -- Iain Lobban, the director of the  Government
Communications Headquarters  listening post and the head of  MI6,
the overseas intelligence agency , John Sawers -- were being
questioned by lawmakers for the first time in public today.  The killing of a 25-year-old soldier outside a London
barracks in May was the first attack to be treated as a
terrorist incident in several years. Two men will go on trial
accused of that murder later this month. In 2005, 52 people died
after four Islamist suicide bombers set off explosions on
underground trains and a bus in central London during the
morning rush hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
