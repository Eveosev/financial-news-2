Beazley Plc (BEZ)  climbed to the highest in
more than three months after the Lloyd’s of London insurer
increased premiums and forecast an improvement in underwriting
for the full year.  Gross written premiums increased 5 percent to $1.5 billion
in the nine months to Sept 30, as the company wrote more
business in reinsurance and political risk, the company said in
a statement today. Beazley said it expects its combined ratio
will improve to the “mid-eighties” by year-end.  “With such strong operational performance, the prospects
for a special dividend are high,” wrote  Mark Williamson , a
London-based analyst at Peel Hunt LLP who upgraded the shares to
 buy  in a note to clients today. “We believe that today will act
as the catalyst for an upward re-rating.”  The shares gained 5.2 percent to 239.9 pence at the close
in London, the highest level since the insurer reported a slump
in first-half profit in July. The company at the time reported a
combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a percentage of
premiums, of 89 percent.  “Overall claims have developed favorably during 2013, and
we have only moderate exposure” to floods and hail storms,
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Horton said in the statement.
“Provided that this experience continues until the year-end, we
expect to achieve a strong combined ratio.”  Investment income for the nine-month period was $25.1
million, with an annualized return of 0.8 percent. That compares
to a return of 2.1 percent last year.  The stock is up 36 percent this year, the best-performing
member on the FTSE 350 Nonlife Insurance Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
