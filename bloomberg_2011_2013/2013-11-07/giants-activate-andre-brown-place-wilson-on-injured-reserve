The  New York Giants  activated Andre
Brown to help the National Football League’s 30th-ranked rushing
offense and ended  David Wilson ’s season.  Brown, 26, broke his leg last November and fractured the
bone again during preseason. The team’s leader in rushing
touchdowns last season, he is expected to play Nov. 10 when the
Giants host the  Oakland Raiders .  “It looks like he’s physically running pretty well,”
offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride told reporters yesterday.
“When he’s healthy, he helps us. He can run. He’s big enough to
block. He catches the ball well. He’s an all-around guy.”  Wilson, 22, began the year as New York’s starting running
back before losing two fumbles in a season-opening loss to the
 Dallas Cowboys . New York’s first-round draft pick in 2012, he
rushed 44 times for 146 yards and one touchdown before he
herniated a disk in his neck. He was placed on injured reserve
yesterday, the team said in an e-mailed release.  The Giants have rushed for 69.9 yards per game, third
fewest in the NFL. Last year Brown ran for 385 yards and a team-high eight touchdowns before breaking his leg.  The team also activated defensive tackle Markus Kuhn, who
hasn’t played since tearing a knee ligament last year, and
placed defensive lineman Shaun Rogers on the injured reserve
list, according to the release. A 13-year veteran, Rogers
injured his knee on Oct. 21 and hasn’t played since.  To contact the reporter on this story:
