Repossessed properties in  Spain  were
sold in the first half for about 72 percent less than the value
assigned when mortgages on the homes were originated,  Fitch
Ratings  said today.  The average discount accelerated from 59 percent in 2012
and 42 percent in 2009, Carlos Masip, a Fitch analyst in Madrid,
wrote in the report analyzing 7,406 properties sold since 2009.  “The sharp value declines highlight the dysfunctional
state of the  property market , characterized by a supply and
demand mismatch,” Masip wrote in the report.  Spanish home prices have fallen 40 percent since their 2007
peak, according to Fotocasa.es and the IESE Business School.
Spain’s bad bank, created last year to take real estate assets
off bailed out lenders’ books, has started selling properties.  Fitch found that 44 percent of the repossessed properties
included in mortgage-backed securities that it rates have been
sold, compared with 31 percent in December 2011. That’s a result
of banks’ “willingness to offload” properties and accept
“deeper discounts”, it said.  While some market players are interpreting foreign interest
in residential property as a “sign of market recovery,” Fitch
said foreign appetite is “mainly driven by opportunist bargain
hunting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
