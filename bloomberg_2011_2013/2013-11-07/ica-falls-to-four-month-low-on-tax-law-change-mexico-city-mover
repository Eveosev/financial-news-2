Empresas ICA SA (ICA*) , Mexico’s biggest
construction company, fell to a four-month low on concern
profits will be hurt by rising tax expenses after lawmakers
passed fiscal reforms sought by President Enrique Pena Nieto.  The shares  declined 2.7 percent to 23.05 pesos at 2:36 p.m.
in Mexico City. A close at that level would be the lowest since
June 25. It was the second-worst performance among the 35 stocks
on the country’s benchmark IPC index, which slipped 0.6 percent.  Mexico’s Congress voted Oct. 31 to eliminate some benefits
that allowed companies with money-losing subsidiaries to defer
tax payments. The legislation is part of reform measures Pena
Nieto is pushing to reduce the country’s dependence on oil
revenue and boost growth. ICA needs to see how the changes will
affect its business and determine how to pay the tax, Chief
Executive Officer Alonso Quintana said in an interview with
Milenio published on Nov. 5.  “It can hurt them once they can’t consolidate all of their
subsidiaries” for tax purposes, Jorge Lagunas, who oversees
about $200 million in stocks at Grupo Financiero Interacciones
SA, said in a telephone interview from  Mexico  City.  Ana Paulina Rubio, an investment relations official with
ICA, said the recent declines in the stock were driven by
concern the tax changes will negatively impact the company.  Bank of America Corp. last month lowered its recommendation
on the shares to the equivalent of hold from buy, citing the
possibility of higher taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
