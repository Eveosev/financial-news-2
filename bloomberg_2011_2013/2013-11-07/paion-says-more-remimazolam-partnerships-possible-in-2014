Paion AG (PA8) , a German drugmaker whose
shares have more than doubled this year, may enter further
partnerships to sell its Remimazolam sedative, Chief Executive
Officer Wolfgang Soehngen said.  “We’re in talks, and are increasingly seeing more
interested parties,” Soehngen said in an interview yesterday.
“We don’t expect to reach a deal this year.”  A partnership would expand Remimazolam’s potential reach
beyond the countries in which Paion already has agreements for
the experimental product. The Aachen-based company’s stock has
risen about 75 percent since announced licensing deals last week
with R-Pharm in Russia and Hana Pharm Co. in  South Korea .  The sedative is partnered in China with  Humanwell
Healthcare Group (600079)  Co. “These deals allow us to benchmark the
value of any future agreements,” Soehngen said.  Paion rose 5.6 percent to close at 1.995 euros in
 Frankfurt , giving the company a market value of 50.6 million
euros ($67.8 million).  The stock has risen 139 percent this year. It pared gains
yesterday after Paion said it lost 3.5 million euros in the
first nine months of the year, compared with a 15.8 million euro
profit a year earlier, when the company benefited from the sale
of the Desmotoplase drug to H. Lundbeck A/S for 20.1 million
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
