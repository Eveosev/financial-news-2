World Series Most Valuable Player
 David Ortiz  of the  Boston Red Sox  and New York Yankees second
baseman  Robinson Cano  were among the 18 winners of Major League
Baseball’s annual Silver Slugger awards.  Ortiz, 37, the designated hitter who batted .688 with two
home runs in Boston’s World Series victory against the  St. Louis
Cardinals , is a six-time winner of the award, presented each
year to the best offensive player at each position in the
American League and National League. Voted on by MLB managers
and coaches, the winners were announced yesterday on MLB
Network.  Cano, 31, who is a free agent, led all AL second baseman
with a .314 average, 27 home runs and 107 runs batted in. The
only player from either New York team to win the honor, Cano has
won a Silver Slugger award five times in his career.  Pedro Alvarez of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Paul
Goldschmidt of the  Arizona  Diamondbacks, who tied for the
National League home run crown with 36 each, were among nine
first-time winners.  Three  Baltimore Orioles , including AL home run leader Chris Davis, received the honor, more than from any other team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
