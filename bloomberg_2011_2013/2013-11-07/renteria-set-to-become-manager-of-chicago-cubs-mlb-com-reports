Rick Renteria, the former bench coach
of the San Diego Padres, will be introduced in absentia today as
the 53rd manager of the  Chicago Cubs , MLB.com reported, citing a
person familiar with the transaction.  Renteria, 51, who is recovering from hip surgery, can’t
travel to Chicago,  MLB.com said .  Renteria replaces  Dale Sveum , 49, who was fired Sept. 30
after going 127-197 in two seasons in Chicago and leading the
Cubs to last place in their division last season to miss the
playoffs for the fifth straight year. The Cubs’ playoff absence
extended their championship drought to 105 years, the longest in
 Major League Baseball .  Renteria is the fifth manager to be hired this offseason
and the fourth with no previous big league managing experience,
MLB.com said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
