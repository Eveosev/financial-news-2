Cattle futures fell to the lowest in
almost three weeks on signs of slowing U.S. demand for beef. Hog
prices rose, snapping the longest slump in eight months.  Wholesale  beef  at midday fell 0.2 percent to $2.0408 a
pound, the lowest since Oct. 28, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. The price headed for the third straight decline, the
longest slump since Sept. 27. Demand may be ebbing before the
Nov. 28 Thanksgiving holiday, when people traditionally eat
turkey, according to Northstar Commodity Investment Co.  “Movement has really slowed down on the beef as of late,”
Mark Schultz, the chief analyst at Northstar in  Minneapolis ,
said in a telephone interview. “Demand has probably backed up a
little bit domestically.”  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$1.31675 a pound at 12:46 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price touched $1.3155, the lowest for the
most-active contract since Oct. 18.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.3 percent to
87.65 cents a pound. The price declined in the previous seven
sessions, the longest slump since Feb. 22.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement declined 0.4
percent to $1.6495 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
