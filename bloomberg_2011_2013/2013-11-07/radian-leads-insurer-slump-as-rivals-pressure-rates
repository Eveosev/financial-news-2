Radian Group Inc. (RDN)  led a slump of
mortgage insurers after Chief Executive Officer S.A. Ibrahim
said increased competition pressured rates.  Radian  dropped  $1.02, or 7 percent, to $13.50 at 10:37 a.m.
in  New York .  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)  slipped 6.5 percent.  MGIC and Philadelphia-based Radian more than doubled this
year after selling stock and bonds to bolster capital as
investors bet they will prosper in a  housing rebound . The
recovery has drawn newcomers, like  Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT) , which is
backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and
had an initial public offering last month.  Genworth Financial
Inc. (GNW)  has said it is cutting rates for the coverage.  Executives at Radian “anticipate increased competition in
our industry from new and existing mortgage insurance
companies,” Ibrahim said. “Competitors recently reduced their
borrower-paid mortgage insurance premiums by 5 basis points,
which we promptly matched.”  Radian today posted a net third-quarter loss of $12.7
million. Genworth, which also sells  life insurance , said last
month that its U.S. mortgage unit had its first loss of the year
in the three months ended Sept. 30.  Genworth slumped 4.4 percent while Essent slipped 1.9
percent. Mortgage insurers cover losses when homeowners default
and foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
