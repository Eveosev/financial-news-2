Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  is seeking
approval to double the amount of crude handled by a planned rail
project at the St. Charles, Louisiana, refinery and to add a
unit to a proposed plant expansion.  A  permit application  filed with the state on Oct. 24 shows
plans for an rail car unloading station that could receive as
much as 30,000 barrels a day, up from 15,000. Valero was
authorized to build the project in January.  The company also asked to revise an expansion project first
approved in 2007 so that the refinery can add a catalytic naptha
hydrotreater. Once that’s complete, Valero plans to operate an
aromatics BTX extraction unit, a fourth sulfur recovery unit, a
sixth river dock and a new crude desalter.  “The application was done in anticipation of possible
future projects that have not been approved or budgeted yet,”
 Bill Day , a spokesman at Valero headquarters in  San Antonio ,
said by e-mail today. “All of these are still in the discussion
phase, and so it’s too early for us to talk about them in
detail.”  Valero requested the permits be issued on an expedited
basis by Feb. 28. The revision to the expansion is the final
design change for the project.  The St. Charles refinery has a capacity of 250,000 barrels
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It receives oil
by pipeline from the  Louisiana Offshore Oil Port  and from five
docks along the  Mississippi River , according to  Valero’s
website .  Valero said in a presentation for an energy conference in
September it expected to transport 20,000 barrels a day of
Canadian heavy crude to the plant by the first quarter of 2014
using company-owned rail cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
