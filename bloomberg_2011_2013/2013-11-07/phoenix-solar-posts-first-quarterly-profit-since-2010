Phoenix Solar AG (PS4)  recorded a quarterly
profit for the first time in almost three years as the solar-plant developer focused on growing markets in the U.S. and  Asia .  Phoenix reported net income of 200,000 euros ($270,400) in
the third quarter, compared with a loss of 5.8 million euros a
year earlier, the Sulzemoos, Germany-based company said today in
an e-mailed statement. It forecast a full-year loss before
interest and taxes of 2 million euros to 7 million euros.  “We will most certainly be closer to the ‘better’ Ebit
result of minus 2 million,” Chief Executive Officer Bernd Koehler said in a letter to shareholders. He advised
“caution,” saying Phoenix is increasingly dependent on its
project business and must generate more stable sales while a
recovery in European markets remains elusive.  Phoenix fell as much as 6.9 percent in  Frankfurt , and was
down 6.6 percent at 5.958 euros as of 10:53 a.m. local time.  The company’s non-German units accounted for 83 percent of
sales in the first nine months of the year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
