Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s
government is offering rewards of 500,000 Syrian pounds
($3,600), for the capture of “non-Syrian terrorists,”
according to state-run television.  The government is also offering rewards of 200,000 Syrian
pounds for helping to capture them, al-Ikhbariya TV reported
today. Assad has repeatedly accused foreign powers of
instigating an uprising against him and financing the
opposition.  The reward may tempt some Syrians who are coping with an
economy that shrank 28 percent in 2012 and 37 percent at an
annualized rate in the first half of 2013, according to the
Economist Intelligence Unit. The Syrian pound, which traded at
about 47 pounds to the dollar before the war, is now 139 pounds
per dollar, according to central bank data.  The Syrian civil war has killed more than 100,000 people
since it began in 2011, according to estimates adopted by the
 United Nations . The war has resulted in losses of almost $50
billion to gross domestic product since 2010, the EIU said in a
report this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
