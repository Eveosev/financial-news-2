U.S. mortgage rates rose, increasing
borrowing costs from a four-month low as an expanding recovery
in  home prices  reduces affordability for some would-be buyers.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to
4.16 percent the week ended today from 4.1 percent,  Freddie Mac 
said in a statement today. The average 15-year rate rose to 3.27
percent from 3.2 percent.  A jump in rates since May and home-price gains that are
spreading to more areas of the U.S. have caused some buyers to
hold back. Demand should pick up if rates stay close to current
levels, which are not far from historic lows, said Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. strategist for TD Securities in  New York .  “There’s enough momentum in the housing market for the
recovery to keep going,” Goldberg said yesterday in a telephone
interview. “Slightly higher rates shouldn’t be enough to derail
the housing recovery.”  Prices for single-family homes climbed in 88 percent of
U.S. cities in the third quarter as buyers competed for limited
 inventories , data from the National Association of Realtors
show. The nationwide median price for a previously owned house
rose 12.5 percent from a year earlier to $207,300, the group
reported yesterday.  Contracts (USPHTMOM)  to buy existing residences dropped the most in
more than three years in September, the Realtors association
said last week.  Applications for home-purchase loans slipped last week to
the lowest level since December, data from the  Mortgage Bankers
Association  showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
