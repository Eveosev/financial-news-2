Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) ,
 Colombia ’s largest independent crude producer, fell the most in
seven months after the company reported lower-than-estimated
sales and the price of oil dropped.  The shares dropped 7.5 percent to 36,440 pesos at 2:47 p.m.
in Bogota trading, the biggest decline on a closing basis since
April 3. The company was the worst performer on the benchmark
Colcap index, which decreased 1 percent.  Brent crude  dropped to
a four-month low.  Total volume sold decreased 3 percent to 123,689 barrels
per day from the prior quarter as Pacific Rubiales contributed
output to fill the new Bicentenario pipeline and as it delivered
oil to Ecopetrol SA as part of an arbitration settlement, the
company said today in a statement. Revenue increased to $1.11
billion, compared with an average forecast of $1.19 billion
among nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “It’s a negative day on the market, and actual results
were slightly below consensus,” Darren Engels, an analyst at
FirstEnergy Capital Corp., said in a telephone interview from
Calgary. “Production, sales volume and  cash flow , they were
slightly below though not drastically.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
