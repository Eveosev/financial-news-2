Rubber futures in  Tokyo  rebounded
from a one-month low, snapping a four-day losing streak, as a
recovery in oil eased speculation prices of competing synthetic
products may decline.  The contract for delivery in April on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange added as much as 0.7 percent to 257 yen a kilogram
($2,606 a metric ton) and traded at 256.4 yen at 11:56 a.m in
Tokyo. Futures reached 255.2 yen yesterday, the lowest
settlement since Oct. 4 for a most-active contract.  West Texas Intermediate gained for a second day after
yesterday surging the most in five weeks, as U.S. government
data showed gasoline demand in the largest oil user increased to
the highest level since July. Japan’s currency traded near a
two-week low against the dollar before the release of U.S.
growth and jobs data, raising the appeal of yen-based contracts.  “Rubber drew support from the currency and energy
markets,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company
JSC Corp. in Tokyo. “The focus is on whether U.S. data this
week will add to speculation that the Fed will maintain stimulus
to support an economic recovery.”  The  U.S. economy  probably grew at a 2 percent annualized
rate in the third quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent gain in
the previous period, shows a Bloomberg survey before today’s
report. Economists predict data Nov. 8 will show payrolls
climbed by 120,000 in October and the  unemployment rate 
increased to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent in the previous month.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
added 0.3 percent to 19,480  yuan  ($3,198) a ton. Thai rubber
free-on-board dropped 0.4 percent to 77.55 baht ($2.48) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
