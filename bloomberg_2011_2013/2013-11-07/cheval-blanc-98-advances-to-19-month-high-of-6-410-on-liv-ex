A case of 1998 Chateau Cheval Blanc,
a Saint-Emilion wine estate, sold for 3,985 pounds ($6,410) on
Liv-ex this week, 17 percent above its low for this year in
January, amid signs of some pickup in trading on the exchange.  The sale yesterday, following a seven-month price slide in
top Bordeaux wines, was 1.5 percent above the previous 2013 high
of 3,925 pounds a case reached in February, according to data on
the London-based market’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top claret,
fell 1.5 percent in October, its sixth month of declines in the
past seven and extending a slide which has taken it down about 6
percent since the end of March. Investors deterred by prices of
recent Bordeaux wines have looked to older vintages as well as
growers from outside the region for diversification.  Even with the price slide, “there were some positive
signs” toward the end of last month, Liv-Ex said in its Cellar
Watch market report. On the exchange “the bid-offer ration rose
to 0.35, and active markets hit a record high.”  This week’s price was 20 percent below the 4,996 pound
level which Cheval Blanc ’98 reached on Liv-ex in January 2011,
as Asian demand for top Bordeaux was driving prices, and 26
percent below the level of 5,355 pounds at which it traded in
August 2007 before the onset of the global financial crisis and
the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  It is more than double the 1,900 pounds at which it traded
in October 2002 as the Liv-ex market was still in its early
stages of development.  Cabernet Franc  The 1998 Cheval Blanc ranks as the estate’s fifth-most-expensive wine of the past 15 years, lagging behind the 2010,
2009, 2005 and 2000 vintages, according to merchant prices
collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  The vintage was given a rating of 96+ points on a 100-point
scale by U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , making it the second-highest rated of its decade after the 1990 wine, according to
data on the  eRobertParker.com  website.  Cheval Blanc is rated among the top four growers in Saint-Emilion in the 2012 rankings published in September last year.
It has the status of Premier Grand Cru Classe A alongside
Chateau Ausone, Chateau Pavie and Chateau Angelus in the
classification, which replaced one dating from 1996.  Cheval Blanc has 58 percent of its vineyard planted with
Cabernet Franc and the remaining 42 percent with Merlot,
according to the estate’s  website . The average age of the vines
is more than 40 years.  The estate is one of the top wines marketed by  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the world’s largest luxury goods
company, along with Moet & Chandon,  Dom Perignon , Krug and Veuve
Clicquot Champagnes and Chateau d’Yquem Sauternes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
