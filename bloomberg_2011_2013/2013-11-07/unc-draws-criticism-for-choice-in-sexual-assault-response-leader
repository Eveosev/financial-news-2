The University of  North Carolina  at
Chapel Hill drew criticism for appointing an Education
Department official to head up its response to sexual assault,
the subject of three federal reviews this year.  Howard Kallem, the Education Department’s chief regional
attorney in  Washington  for the  Office for Civil Rights , will
become UNC’s Title IX coordinator in January, the Chapel Hill,
North Carolina-based school said Friday. He will oversee UNC’s
compliance with Title IX, the law that bars gender-based
discrimination in education, including inadequate response to
campus assaults.  The Office for  Civil Rights  is conducting the reviews
focusing on UNC’s own investigations and reporting of sexual
assaults. Choosing Kallem suggests that the school is more
interested in protecting itself from federal sanctions than
supporting assault victims, said Andrea Pino, a UNC student who
helped form a national  network  of college women fighting campus
sexual assaults.  “The university may be putting too much emphasis on
compliance and what looks good, rather than folks who have
experience with survivors,” Pino said in a telephone interview.
“What you need is the help to get you to the rest of your
life.”  Kallem, who will manage campus-wide Title IX outreach
programs, is a “recognized expert in  Title IX  compliance,”
said Brenda Richardson Malone, UNC’s vice chancellor of human
resources.  ‘First Priority’  A “first priority” will be listening to and learning from
people throughout UNC about their concerns, Kallem said in a
statement. His appointment as full-time Title IX coordinator, a
position that many schools don’t have, shows UNC’s commitment to
student safety and support, he said.  “Together, the team will develop strategies to provide
education, student engagement, programming, prevention and
compliance,” he said.  Colleges across the U.S. are under heightened scrutiny for
failures to adequately address sexual violence and harassment.
Women at schools including UNC; Dartmouth College in Hanover,
 New Hampshire ; Occidental College and the  University of Southern
California  in Los Angeles; Swarthmore College in  Pennsylvania ;
and the  University of Connecticut  in Storrs have filed formal
complaints with the Education Department saying they were denied
equal access to education because their schools mishandled or
ignored reports of sexual assault.  Seeking Support  Pino, who visits colleges across the country to connect
sexual-assault survivors with campus resources, said many
universities are too focused on how to comply with federal
regulations when most survivors just want enough support to
graduate.  Schools that fail to comply with Title IX may face fines
and loss of federal student financial aid eligibility.  “Universities are so focused on this compliance
mentality,” Pino said. “Universities are simply trying to
avoid legal complaints.”  Someone with a strong background in Title IX compliance was
needed to fill the position, Susan Hudson, a UNC spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
