Areva SA (AREVA) , the world’s largest
nuclear-reactor builder, signed a 1.25 billion-euro contract
with Brazil’s Electrobras Electronuclear to complete the
construction of the Angra 3 reactor in the Rio de Janeiro state.  The French company will provide engineering services and
the digital control and command system for the nuclear center,
it said in an e-mailed statement.  The contract brings the number of nuclear reactors built
globally by the group to 103. Last month, Areva won a contract
worth more than 2 billion euros to supply two nuclear reactors
and control systems for a new station at Hinkley Point in
southwest  England , showing that a six-year lull in orders may be
coming to an end.  “The completion of Angra 3 confirms  Brazil ’s ambitions for
its nuclear program and illustrates the pertinence of the source
of energy as a solution for sustainable economic development,”
Areva Chief Executive Officer Luc Oursel said in the statement.  The Brazilian plant, which is now more than 50 percent
completed, is due to start operating by mid-2018, Areva Chief
Commercial Officer Tarik Choho said on a conference call today.  Brazil plans to add as much as 5 gigawatts of nuclear power
by 2030, and has started talks with various suppliers including
Areva and rivals from countries such as  Russia , China, the U.S.
and  Japan , he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
