Spanish  industrial output  rose in
September for the first time in 2 1/2 years as the euro region’s
 fourth-largest  economy began its recovery from a recession.  Production at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for
the number of working days increased 1.4 percent from a year
earlier, after declining a revised 2.1 percent in August, the
National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said in a  statement 
today. Economists forecast a 1.4 percent drop, according to the
median of eight estimates.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is counting on exports to  end 
an economic slump triggered in 2008 by the collapse of a real-estate boom. Unemployment has  surged  to 26 percent, while the
nation’s  budget deficit  was the largest in the European Union
last year.  Gross domestic product rose 0.1 percent in the third
quarter after a 0.1 percent drop in the previous three months.
Industrial production accounts for about 16 percent of the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
