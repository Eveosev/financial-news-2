Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s 
credit rating was cut by  Standard & Poor’s , saying the
government decision to set up an internal bad bank will
undermine efforts to return the lender to profit.  “The changes amount to a material extension of RBS’s long-running restructuring, further delaying the bank’s return to
profitability,” the ratings company said in a statement today.
“In addition, considerable uncertainties remain regarding RBS’
exposure to future litigation and conduct risk.”  S&P downgraded RBS’s long-term debt rating by one step to
BBB+ from A-. RBS said last week the bad bank unit would include
38 billion pounds ($61 billion) in toxic assets including 14.8
billion pounds being transferred from the core unit and 23.5
billion pounds from its non-core division.  It also cut the long-term rating of the bank’s Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc unit by one step to A-, four levels above junk,
and maintained a negative outlook.  RBS fell 1.9 percent to 321.80 pence in  London . Britain’s
largest state-owned bank has dropped 0.8 percent this year,
while  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  is up 54 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
