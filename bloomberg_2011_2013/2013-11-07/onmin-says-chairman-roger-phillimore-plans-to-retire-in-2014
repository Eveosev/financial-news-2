Lonmin Plc (LMI) , the world’s third-biggest
platinum producer, said Chairman Roger Phillimore plans to
retire next year.  He will remain in office until a successor has been
appointed, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Phillimore was appointed a director of the company in
1997 and became chairman in 2009.  The company has started the process of finding someone to
succeed him, it said.  Lonmin returned to profit in the first half, and plans to
produce more than 700,000 ounces of platinum metals in
concentrate this year, it said on May 13. Producers in  South
Africa , which has the world’s biggest reserves of the metal, are
negotiating pay increases with workers and are seeking to avoid
a repeat of violent strikes that led to the deaths of miners
last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
