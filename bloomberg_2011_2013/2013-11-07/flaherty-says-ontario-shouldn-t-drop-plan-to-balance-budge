Ontario and the rest of  Canada ’s
provinces shouldn’t give up plans to balance budgets over the
medium term, Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today.  Speaking to reporters in Toronto, where Ontario Finance
Minister Charles Sousa is scheduled to give a budget update
later today, Flaherty said “what I don’t want to hear from the
government of Ontario is that they’re abandoning their plan” to
balance the budget in the fiscal year that begins April 2017.  Flaherty said that while he recognizes the provinces can’t
eliminate deficits “overnight, it can be done in the medium
term.”  Flaherty also said he won’t raise taxes as part of the
effort to bring Canada back to balance in the year beginning
April 2015. The finance department is watching for signs of a
bubble in Canada’s housing market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
