Stocks in Switzerland  advanced for a
second day as company earnings beat forecasts and as investors
awaited the European Central Bank’s interest-rate decision.  Transocean Ltd. rose 3.5 percent, Nobel Biocare Holding AG
climbed 2.7 percent and Swiss Re Ltd. rallied to a five-year
high after reporting third-quarter profits that exceeded analyst
projections. Swisscom AG, the country’s largest phone company,
gained 1.8 percent after naming a new chief executive officer.  The  SMI (SMI)  added 0.3 percent to 8,246.76 at 9:44 a.m. in
Zurich. The gauge rallied 2.6 percent in October as U.S.
lawmakers reached a deal to avoid a sovereign default and end a
partial government shutdown. The broader Swiss Performance Index
also added 0.3 percent today.  The ECB will announce its interest-rate decision at 1:45
p.m. in  Frankfurt  and President Mario Draghi will address a
press conference 45 minutes later. Three of 70 economist
estimates compiled by Bloomberg forecast the central bank will
cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent from 0.5
percent. In a separate survey, eight of 38 economists called for
interest rates to be lowered in December.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington  may show the world’s biggest economy expanded at a 2
percent annualized rate in the third quarter after a 2.5 percent
pace in the previous period, according to the median forecast of
87 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
