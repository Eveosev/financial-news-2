Emirates President  Tim Clark  is
pushing  Boeing Co. (BA)  to ensure its newest twin-aisle aircraft
meets the airline’s demands as it readies an order that stands
to be the biggest in aviation history.  The carrier is still haggling with Boeing over the
specifications for the 777X as well as with engine manufacturer
 General Electric Co. (GE)  on issues including extra thrust to take
off in hot climates, Clark said. The executive said he needs new
wide-body aircraft to replace Emirates’ current 777 fleet, which
will number 170 jets by the end of this month.  “You’re looking at high numbers,” Clark said in an
interview yesterday at the Arab Air Carriers Organization
meeting in Doha, Qatar. “That’s why it’s so important to us
even at this very late stage that we get it absolutely right.”  Emirates, the biggest operator of the 777 and the Airbus
SAS A380 superjumbo, is wielding its clout and urging the
manufacturers to tailor their wide-body aircraft to the
airline’s requirements. Clark said Boeing is “not quite there
yet” and still has “work to do” on the 777X before he commits
to unveil a deal as early as the Dubai Air Show in 10 days.  Airlines are keen to assure a new aircraft’s specifications
meet their demands even before the first metal is cut as the
models typically remain in their fleets for more than a decade
once they enter service. Clark said he is making a commitment
for airliners that will take him “right up to 2030” as he
plots his next generation of long-haul jets.  Major Purchase  Clark has been pressing Boeing publicly for more than two
years to move forward with a successor to the 777-300ER that
would offer greater capacity. The executive declined to specify
the size of a contract he may sign in Dubai, a bi-annual
aviation show that’s grown as the Middle Eastern airlines expand
their role in world travel.  At the last air show two years ago, Clark ordered 50
777-300ERs, and at the previous expo he ordered 70 Airbus A350s.
Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman, declined to comment on customer
conversations.  While Emirates is likely to dominate the first days of the
show, other carriers are also looking to place orders. Boeing is
in talks with Qatar Airways Ltd.,  Etihad Airways  and  Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  about 777X orders worth as much as $87
billion including the Emirates requirement, people familiar with
the matter said previously.  Possible Alternatives  The Emirates president reiterated he would like more A380
superjumbos, beyond the 90 he’s ordered so far, though is
constrained by limited space at the current Dubai airport.  “We know where we want to be with the fleet, we know what
the numbers need to be,” he said.  While Boeing’s updated 777 is the most keenly awaited wide-body program of recent years, given the success of the current
model, the Chicago-based company is not alone in chasing major
orders. Airbus is marketing its largest A350 variant as an
alternative, and the plane -- called the A350-1000 --  is set to
enter service three years before the 777X, which Clark sees
debuting in 2020 at the earliest.  “There are other airplanes in the frame,” Clark said.
“They’re improving the Airbus A350-1000.”  Emirates already has 70 A350s on order, 10 of them the
A350-1000 variant. Clark had said publicly that he wasn’t yet
satisfied with the performance promised on the A350, joining
executives including Akbar  Al Baker , the chief executive officer
of Qatar Airways Ltd. and the first A350 customer.  Desert Heat  Boeing is giving its 777 a radical makeover, designing a
plane that will boast the biggest engines ever and a record
wingspan. Its first variant, the 777-9X, will be able to fly as
far as 8,000 nautical miles (14,800 kilometers) with more than
400 passengers, while burning 20 percent less fuel than the
current 777. A second type, carrying 350, will push past 9,400
nautical miles, enough to go nonstop from  New York  to  Singapore .  Airbus’s A350, powered only by  Rolls-Royce Plc (RR/)  engines,
performed its maiden flight this year and the first variant is
set to enter service in 2014.  Airbus said the A350-1000 model
will offer 25 percent better operating economics than Boeing’s
777-300ER, and the Toulouse, France-based company has said it
might stretch the A350 even beyond the -1000 if airlines show
sufficient interest.  Clark said General Electric has dropped a water injection
system for the 777X engine that Emirates would have found useful
in desert-heat conditions. Instead, the manufacturer will need
to make changes to the maximum thrust coming from the engines to
help the plane take off in hot air, which is less dense than
colder air and therefore provides less lift.  A spokesman at GE said the company continues to evaluate a
water-injection system, and that the engine’s entry into service
is several years away.  “The adjustments to the thrust that have to compensate for
the lack of water injection and cooling elements have got to be
dealt with,” Clark said. “And they are being dealt with.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
