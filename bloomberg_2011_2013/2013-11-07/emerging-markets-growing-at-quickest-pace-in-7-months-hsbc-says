Emerging-market economies grew last
month at the quickest pace since March as global demand for
manufacturing and services improved, HSBC Holdings Plc said,
citing a survey of purchasing managers.  The HSBC  Emerging Markets  Index, which is compiled by
London-based Markit Economics and tracks conditions at more than
5,000 companies, rose to 51.7 in October from 50.7 in September,
HSBC said today in a report. A value of more than 50 indicates
expansion, while less than 50 signals contraction.  While the  International Monetary Fund  cited weakness in
emerging-market economies as it cut its global growth forecast
for this year and next on Oct. 8, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s
decision last month to maintain monetary stimulus has provided a
boost to developing nations.  “With tapering fears in abeyance for now and Europe out of
recession, capital flows and external demand should support
emerging market sentiment and performance through the year
end,” said  Simon Williams , the Dubai-based chief  Middle East 
economist at HSBC Holdings Plc., in the report. “The continued
gains in China data are particularly encouraging, substantiating
our view that fresh stimulus has helped growth find a floor.”  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has fallen 3.8 percent this
year, compared with a 24 percent gain for the  S&P 500 .  The HSBC Emerging Markets Future Output Index, which gauges
company executives’ expectations for output in a year, reached a
seven-month high in October, recovering from a near-record low
the previous month,  HSBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
