The International Monetary Fund
praised the European Central Bank’s move to cut its benchmark
interest rate to a record and said it’s watching deflationary
pressures in the monetary union.  “We strongly welcome the decision by the ECB today, which
we believe can help support the nascent recovery in the euro
area,” IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters in  Washington 
today. “The decision’s fully warranted by the weak inflation
dynamics and substantial slack in the economy.”  ECB President Mario Draghi today warned that the euro area
risks a “prolonged period” of low inflation and pledged to
keep borrowing costs low for an “extended period” as the bank
cut its main refinancing rate by a quarter point to 0.25
percent.  Rice said the the fund is watching deflationary pressures
that have intensified in recent months in some euro-area
countries.  Separately, he said IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde
will submit a report to the board by Nov. 13 on Argentina’s
progress in improving its inflation and gross domestic product
data. The board will then meet to decide whether to take
measures against the country, which it censured earlier this
year.  “Fund staff had constructive discussions with the
authorities on their efforts to improve official data on the
consumer price index and the GDP, including technical exchanges
on the authorities’ development of the new national consumer
price index,” Rice said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
