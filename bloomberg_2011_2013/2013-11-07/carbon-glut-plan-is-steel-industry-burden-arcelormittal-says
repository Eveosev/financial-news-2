ArcelorMittal (MT)  Chief Financial Officer
Aditya Mittal comments on challenges for the steel industry
including the European Union carbon price. He was speaking today
on a call with reporters. The Luxembourg-based company is the
world’s biggest steelmaker.  On challenges facing the industry:  “Clearly there are significant issues in the European
steel industry. Clearly energy remains a big topic of
conversation, flexibility around trying to optimize your
footprint is another, and a third is a discussion around carbon
dioxide.”  On the EU plan to deal with oversupply in the carbon market by
temporarily reducing volumes sold at auction:  “The move to tighten emission standards for the next phase
is another cost burden. There is no steel company in Europe that
can produce at those levels. This is something that the steel
industry is challenging. It is clearly a contrary move to the
steel action plan. I think we’re not seeing enough concrete
action from the steel action plan. The only concrete action we
have seen is a tightening of allowances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
