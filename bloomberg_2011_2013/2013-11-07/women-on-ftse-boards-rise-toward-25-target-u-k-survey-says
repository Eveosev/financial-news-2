Women account for 19 percent of
directors of the 100 largest U.K. companies, up from 17.3
percent in April, a survey by Cranfield University School of
Management found.  In the last six months, 27 percent of appointments to the
boards of companies in the FTSE 100 index have gone to women and
30 percent of those in the FTSE 250, according to the report,
which has charted women’s progress in boardrooms since 1999.  A government-commissioned report in 2011 set a target of 25
percent women on boards by 2015 after the panel, led by  Mervyn Davies , ex-chairman of Standard Chartered Plc, ruled out setting
quotas for companies.  “We are definitely seeing a cultural shift taking place
within U.K. business,” Professor Susan Vinnicombe, director of
the Cranfield International Centre for Women Leaders, said in an
e-mailed statement. “It has been a long and slow journey but it
is encouraging to see the U.K. is making steady progress towards
the 2015 target of 25 percent.”  The survey found that 94 percent of FTSE 100 companies
acknowledge the need for greater boardroom diversity and 65
percent stated a clear policy to achieve it. Women make up 15
percent of members of FTSE 250 boards, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
