  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801) ,  Japan ’s biggest
developer by sales, said profit rose 48 percent in the fiscal
first half after selling some assets.  Net income gained to 39.9 billion yen ($405 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30 from 26.9 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based company said in a statement to the stock
exchange. Sales climbed 3.3 percent to 636.2 billion yen from
the same period a year ago.  Mitsui Fudosan booked a one-time profit of 13.2 billion yen
after selling some properties, which it didn’t name in the
statement. Rental income from leasing, fees from property
management and its hotel business also supported earnings,
according to the statement.  The developer kept its profit forecast unchanged at 65
billion yen for the year ending March 2014, on sales of 1.53
trillion yen, it said.  Operating profit for the company’s leasing business rose to
55.5 billion yen in the six months from 54.7 billion yen in the
same period last year, according to the statement. Operating
profit from its property management division increased 35
percent to 24.2 billion yen, while the residential division
recorded a 66 percent decline, it said.  Mitsui Fudosan’s results contrast with its smaller
competitors that benefited from rising demand for residential
businesses. Mitsubishi Estate Co. said last week net income
surged 76 percent, while Sumitomo Realty & Development Co.
reported a 59 percent increase in profit yesterday, helped by a
boost in apartment sales.  Mitsui Fudosan’s  shares  fell 0.5 percent to 3,210 yen at
the close of trading in  Tokyo . The company announced its results
after the market close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
