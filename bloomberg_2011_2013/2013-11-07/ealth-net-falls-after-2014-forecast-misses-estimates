Health Net Inc. (HNT)  fell the most in 15
months after the insurer’s chief executive officer said earnings
next year are likely to be unchanged, falling short of analysts’
projections.  The shares of the  Woodland Hills , California-based company
declined 6.7 percent to $27.60 at 4 p.m.  New York  time, the
biggest one-day drop since August 2012.  CEO Jay Gellert said 2014 earnings won’t increase from this
year, while analysts had forecast a 26 percent rise to $2.73 a
share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The health
insurer struggled in 2012, twice cutting its profit forecast
that year after having problems with processing claims and
higher-than-expected medical costs. Gellert said he anticipates
changes in the company’s membership makeup as people begin using
the online health marketplaces created under the U.S. Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act.  “We see 2014 as a transition year,” Gellert said today on
a conference call with investors after the company reported
third-quarter earnings.  Health Net hasn’t added as many new members as anticipated
in the second half of this year, Jim Woys, the company’s chief
operating officer, said. “For this reason, we are lowering our
full year 2013 commercial enrollment guidance from a decline of
8 percent to 9 percent to an expected decline of 11 percent to
12 percent,” Woys said in a statement.  The insurer is participating in  California ’s new health
exchange and offered the lowest premiums across  Southern
California  for plans beginning Jan. 1, Scott Fidel, a Deutsche
Bank analyst, said in May. The rates may be a gamble, attracting
sicker customers and driving up medical costs, Fidel said at the
time.  The company also is selling plans through  Oregon ’s state
exchange and the federal website for  Arizona , Gellert said on
the call.  Health Net shares have  gained 6.8 percent  in the last 12
months, compared with a 37 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Managed Health Care Index of major health insurers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
