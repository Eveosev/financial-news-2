Crude options volatility fell with
underlying West Texas Intermediate futures after the  European
Central Bank  unexpectedly cut its benchmark  interest rate .  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
19.62 percent at 4 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
down from 20.76 at settlement yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery dropped
60 cents, to settle at $94.20 a barrel on the Nymex. WTI fell as
 Brent crude  dropped to the lowest level in more than four months
as the euro tumbled against the dollar after the ECBâ€™s move.  Puts accounted for 50.8 percent of electronic trading
volume today. The most-active options were December $90 puts,
which fell 1 cents to 15 cents a barrel with 3,379 lots trading
as of 4:44 p.m. December $92 puts rose 1 cent to 40 cents on
volume of 2,802.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 57 percent of
the 120,741 lots traded. December $90 puts fell 21 cents to 16
cents a barrel with 6,191 contracts trading. December $88 puts
fell 10 cents to 7 cents on volume of 4,914 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for December $80 puts,
with 43,336 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 39,928
lots and December $85 puts with 36,135.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
