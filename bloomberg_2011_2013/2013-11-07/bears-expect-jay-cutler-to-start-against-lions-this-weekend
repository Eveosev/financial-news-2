Chicago Bears quarterback  Jay Cutler 
has been cleared by doctors and is expected to start this
weekend against the  Detroit Lions , coach Marc Trestman said
today in a news conference.  Cutler tore a groin muscle in a 45-41 loss to the
Washington Redskins on Oct. 20 and was projected to miss at
least four weeks. Trestman praised Cutler’s efforts to come back
more quickly, saying he couldn’t recall another National
Football League player rebounding so well from an injury.  The Bears (5-3) won their only game without Cutler and are
in a three-way tie with the Lions and Green Bay Packers atop the
National Football Conference North division.  Backup Josh McCown led the Bears to a 27-20 win over the
Packers on Nov. 4 after the team’s bye week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
