U.S. Senator  Richard Durbin  said
Democrats overwhelmingly support increasing the federal  minimum
wage  to about $10 an hour, higher than the rate proposed by
President  Barack Obama .  Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said legislation
that would raise the wage probably can’t pass in the Republican-controlled House, where Speaker  John Boehner  has vowed to block
such efforts.  “It’s going to that same room, that little dark room,
where Boehner puts all of the bipartisan measures out of the
Senate,” Durbin of Illinois told reporters today after a
meeting of Senate Democrats. In a politically divided Congress,
the House and Senate have refused to take up certain measures
approved in the opposite chamber.  Obama has urged Congress to set the federal minimum wage at
$9 an hour, up from $7.25 in effect since 2009. During a meeting
at the Capitol today, Durbin said it was suggested Obama “would
be very supportive of 10” dollars.  Democrats at the meeting heard from  Jason Furman , Obama’s
economic adviser; Larry Mishel, president of the Economic Policy
Institute; John Arensmeyer, chief executive officer of the Small
Business Majority; and Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, Durbin said.  Raising the minimum wage is “an important economic issue”
that sends “a message to working families struggling paycheck
to paycheck that we can help them,” Durbin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
