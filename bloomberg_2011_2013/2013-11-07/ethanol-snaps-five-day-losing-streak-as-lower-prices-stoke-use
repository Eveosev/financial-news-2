Ethanol rose for the first time in
six days on speculation that prices near the lowest level in
three years will boost consumption of the biofuel.  Futures climbed 1.7 percent, narrowing the discount to
gasoline by 7.29 cents to 86.81 cents a gallon. Ethanol is
blended with gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal
mandates.  “It’s definitely a bargain,” said Jim Damask, a manager
at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida . “Prices are pretty
depressed.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 2.8 cents to
$1.635 a gallon, rebounding from the lowest level since July 26,
2010, and the biggest one-day gain since Oct. 25. Futures
dropped in the previous five sessions, the longest streak of
declines since Aug. 9. Prices have plunged 25 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery fell 4.49 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.5031 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol prices have plummeted 40 percent from this year’s
high of $2.744 a gallon in May as farmers collect what’s
projected to be a record corn crop, helping companies boost
output.  Corn for December delivery slipped 0.75 cent to $4.205 a
bushel in  Chicago  a day after touching a three-year low. One
bushel of the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The December crush spread of corn to ethanol was 11 cents,
up from 8 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Awaiting Report  Damask said ethanol prices are also getting a boost today
from traders who are hesitant to be caught short of supply
before the U.S. Agriculture Department World Corn Supply and
Demand Statistics Estimates report, scheduled to be released at
noon tomorrow in  Washington .  Ethanol  production  last week averaged 902,000 barrels a
day, up 17 percent from the record low in January, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration said in a report yesterday.  That hasn’t been enough to lift stockpiles of the biofuel
from record  seasonal lows,  according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Inventories were at 15.2 million barrels last week, down 16
percent from a year earlier, data from the Energy Department’s
statistical arm show.  The U.S. tracks compliance with the biofuel consumption
standards by using Renewable Identification Numbers, or
certificates attached to each gallon of ethanol, that are
submitted to the government and also traded among refiners.  Corn RINs  Corn-based ethanol RINs  slid 2 cents to 26 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, dropped 3 cents to 34 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  lost 1 cent to
$1.93 a gallon; in Chicago prices slipped 0.5 cent to $1.695; in
the U.S. Gulf the additive dropped 0.5 cent to $1.795; and on
the West Coast the biofuel jumped 10 cents to $1.95 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The West Coast’s premium to the Gulf expanded 10.5 cents to
15.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor narrowed
0.5 cent to 23.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
