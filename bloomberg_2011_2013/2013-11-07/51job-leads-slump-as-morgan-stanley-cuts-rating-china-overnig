Chinese equities fell for a third day
in  New York  as  51job Inc. (JOBS)  tumbled after Morgan Stanley reduced
its recommendation.  RDA Microelectronics Inc. (RDA)  jumped after
receiving a buyout offer.  The Bloomberg China-US Index of the most traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. dropped 2.2 percent to a two-month low of
99.78 yesterday. 51job sank the most in two years, while  Soufun
Holdings Ltd. (SFUN)  slumped 4.1 percent. Suntech Power Holdings Co.
capped a two-day 41 percent drop on concern its restructuring
plan will be derailed. Semiconductor company RDA surged to the
highest since 2010 after Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. proposed to buy
the company.  Morgan Stanley cut its rating on 51job to the equivalent of
sell, saying the online human resources company’s stock is
trading at expensive valuations following better-than-estimated
profit. The shares traded at the highest multiple in two years
last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chinese
social media operators from Sina Corp. to  Renren Inc. (RENN)  slid as
investors bought Twitter Inc.’s stock.  “There are cross-board selloffs of Chinese Internet
companies after their big rallies over the past few months,”
Tian X. Hou, the founder of T. H. Capital LLC, said in a
telephone interview from Beijing. “People had waited for
companies’ results to sell for profit-taking, seeing the stocks’
valuations have priced in the good earnings momentum.”  The  iShares China Large-Cap ETF , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined 1.6 percent to $36.64
in New York, dropping the most in two weeks. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slumped 1.3 percent on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  may scale back stimulus amid faster-than-estimated
economic growth.  ‘Rich Valuation’  American depositary receipts of 51job fell 10 percent to
$69.90, the biggest slump since August 2011. The Shanghai-based
company reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of 75 cents per
ADR, beating the 71-cent average estimate of two analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  Philip Wan, an analyst at Morgan Stanley cut 51job’s rating
from the equivalent of neutral, saying the stock trades at
“rich valuation,” according to an e-mailed note yesterday. The
stock traded at a  record  36 percent premium to the Nasdaq
Composite Index on Oct. 8.  Soufun’s ADRs slid to $51.40, the largest slump since Oct.
25. The Beijing-based company raised its 2014 revenue estimate
by 12 percent to as much as $615 million. The stock reached a
record level on Oct. 18.  Suntech, the largest solar-panel maker in 2011, tumbled 30
percent to 88 cents, the biggest drop since November 2008.  Bankruptcy Petition  The company, whose main unit is reorganizing in the Cayman
Islands, told a Manhattan court that an involuntary bankruptcy
petition against it in the U.S. could derail restructuring
efforts, according to its papers filed Nov. 6 seeking to have
the case dismissed. Trondheim Capital Partners LP, Michael
Meixler and Longball Holdings LLC filed the involuntary petition
under Chapter 7 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code  in New York on Oct.
14. They said they held $578,230.68 in claims against Suntech.  Sina, owner of the Twitter-like Weibo service in China,
slid 3.8 percent to $78.10, the lowest level since August.
Renren, which operates a real-name social networking website,
slumped 3 percent to $3.25, the lowest close since July.  Qihoo 360 Technology Co., a Beijing-based  software
developer  which owns the second-biggest search engine in China,
tumbled 7.6 percent to $77.95, losing the most since May 2012.  ADRs of Shanghai-based RDA surged 11 percent to $17.24, the
highest close since November 2010. Tsinghua Unigroup, which is
funded by China’s  Tsinghua University , proposed to buy the
company for $18 per share, RDA said in a statement yesterday.
The offer was a 16 percent premium over RDA’s closing level on
Nov. 6.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  in  Hong Kong , sank
0.8 percent to 10,474.33, sliding the most since Oct. 25, while
the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slumped 0.5 percent to 2,129.4, the
lowest level since Oct. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
