Rick Renteria was named the  Chicago
Cubs ’ manager, the fourth for the Major League Baseball team in
five seasons.  Renteria’s three-year contract includes club options for
2017 and 2018, the team said today in an e-mailed release.
Financial terms weren’t provided.  It is Renteria’s first job as a major-league manager, after
serving as bench coach for the  San Diego Padres  since 2011. The
51-year-old managed Mexico in this year’s World Baseball
Classic.  The Cubs have finished fifth in their division for four
straight seasons and haven’t reached the playoffs since 2008.  Renteria was among six people to interview for the Chicago
job, according to MLB.com. He inherits a team with a young core,
including 23-year-old shortstop Starlin Castro, an All-Star in
2011 and 2012, and 24-year-old first baseman Anthony Rizzo.  Renteria spent four seasons managing within the Padres
organization at Single-A Lake Elsinore and Triple-A Portland
before being named first base coach with the major-league club
in 2007. He played parts of five major-league seasons from 1986
to 1994 and managed in the Florida Marlins organization for four
seasons at the Single-A and Double-A levels.  Renteria succeeds  Dale Sveum , who was 127-197 in two years.
He is the fifth manager to be hired this offseason and the
fourth with no previous major-league managing experience,
according to MLB.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
