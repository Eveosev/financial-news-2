Sappi Ltd. (SAP) , the world’s largest maker
of glossy paper, swung to a loss in 2013 as demand fell in its
main European markets.  The loss of $161 million for the 12 months through
September compared with a profit of $104 million a year ago, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. Sales fell
7 percent to $5.93 billion, it said.  Sappi plans to shut down part of its European operations
over a three-year period in order to boost margins and cut
costs, resulting in a charge of $190 million during the fourth
quarter. The company said results would improve for 2014, helped
by the restructuring and commissioning of new plants for
specialized cellulose in  North America  and  South Africa .  “Our profitability in the 2014 financial year is expected
to be better than that of 2013 as a result of a larger
specialized cellulose business,” the company said. A gradual
improvement in Europe will be supported by the profitability of
southern African and North American paper businesses, it said.  Sappi shares fell  1.5 percent  to 29.30 rand by 10:15 a.m.
in Johannesburg. The stock has declined 5.1 percent this year,
compared with a 17 percent gain in the  165-member FTSE/JSE
Africa All Share Index. (JALSH)   To contact the reporter on this story:
