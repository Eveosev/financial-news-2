Le Gavroche is London’s top restaurant, Clos Maggiore best for romance and the Wolseley is the first choice for business and breakfast, according to  Harden’s .  The Oxo Tower restaurant is the most overpriced and has the most disappointing cooking, according to the guide’s annual online survey, which was completed by 9,000 diners.  Michel Roux Jr.’s  Le Gavroche in Mayfair holds two Michelin stars and has been open since 1967. For the first time it received the most Harden’s nominations for best meal.  Roux becomes only the seventh chef in the survey’s 23-year history to preside over the finest restaurant. He follows  Pierre Koffmann ,  Joel Antunes ,  Gordon Ramsay ,  Marcus Wareing ,  Brett Graham  and  Heston Blumenthal .  The main top 10 ranking also sees debuts by two new restaurants, Dabbous and Medlar, while Ramsay drops out after a 12-year run (1997-2008) as chef of the top restaurant.  Restaurant Gordon Ramsay was the second most-nominated for having the most pricey food, and in third place for most disappointing cooking. The new London outpost of another Michelin chef, Ametsa with Arzak Instruction, makes the list for cuisine below expectations.  For the ninth straight year, “London’s Favorite Restaurant,” based on the number of survey nominations, is Bruce Poole’s Chez Bruce, whose standards belie its Wandsworth location, according to the guide’s editors.  The average price of dinner for one, including half a bottle of wine, coffee and service, is now 47.68 pounds ($76.65). Prices have risen by 3.5 percent in the past 12 months, at a slightly higher rate than inflation.  Muse highlights include  Catherine Hickley  on German art,  Jason Harper  on cars,  Rich Jaroslovsky  on technology,  Amanda Gordon’s  Scene Last Night and  Katya Kazakina  on art auctions.
