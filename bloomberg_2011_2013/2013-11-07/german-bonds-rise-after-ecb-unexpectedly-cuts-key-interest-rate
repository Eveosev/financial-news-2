Euro-area government bonds surged,
led by Italian and Spanish securities, after the European
Central Bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate to a
record low, boosting demand for fixed-income assets.  Italy ’s  two-year yield  fell to the lowest level in more
than five months, while the rate on Germany’s two-year notes
dropped to the  least  since May. The ECB reduced the  main
refinancing rate  by 25 basis points to 0.25 percent. The
decision was forecast by three out of 70 economists in Bloomberg
News survey, with the remainder predicting no change. ECB
President Mario Draghi, speaking to reporters in  Frankfurt , said
weaker growth is a downside risk to inflation.  “The euro region is likely to get stuck in a low-growth,
low-inflation environment for a while,” said  Harvinder Sian , a
fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
London. “For the ECB’s easing bias to have any meaningful
credibility at all, it has to act. And it did.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  slid 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 4.09 percent at 4:31 p.m. London time after
reaching 4.04 percent, the least since May 28. The 4.5 percent
bond maturing in March 2024 rose 1.025, or 10.25 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,339) face amount, to 103.785. Italian  two-year 
yields fell as much as 18 basis points to 1.24 percent, the
lowest level since May 20.  Spain’s 10-year yield fell 10 basis points to 4.05 percent,
the biggest decline since Oct. 1. The rate on the nation’s two-year notes dropped 11 basis points to 1.42 percent.  Inflation Slows  Data released on Oct. 31 showed the annual  inflation rate 
in the 17-nation currency bloc fell to 0.7 percent, the lowest
since November 2009.  The ECB now has just one more quarter-point cut left before
reaching zero, increasing the likelihood of unconventional tools
such as quantitative easing or a negative deposit rate if prices
slow further or the economic recovery stalls. Euro-area
inflation is less than half the ECB’s 2 percent target and
unemployment is at the highest level since the currency bloc was
formed in 1999.  The ECB kept its  deposit rate  at zero and trimmed the
marginal lending rate to 0.75 percent.  Pledging to keep borrowing costs low for an “extended
period,” Draghi said weakening price pressures justified the
ECB’s surprise decision to cut its main interest rate.  “We may experience a prolonged period of low inflation,”
Draghi told reporters after the central-bank decision.  Spread Tightening  The additional yield, or spread, investors demand for
holding Italian 10-year bonds compared to their German
equivalents narrowed seven basis points to 240 basis points
after dropping to 236, the least since Oct. 24.  Spain (GSPG10YR) ’s 10-year
yield spread over Germany tightened four basis points to 237
basis points.  “The strong gain in peripheral bonds today reflects a
market theme that looser policy and more liquidity will benefit
countries like Italy and Spain more than core countries like
Germany,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “We expect the yield spread
tightening trend to continue.”  Spain sold 1.14 billion euros of 10-year securities today
at the  lowest  auction yield in more than three years. The
Madrid-based Treasury allotted the 2023 bonds at an average
yield of 4.164 percent, compared with 4.269 percent at a
previous sale on Oct. 3. Investors bid for 2.57 times the amount
of debt on offer versus 1.96 times in October.  Unlimited Cash  Draghi said that the central bank will extend its unlimited
offerings of one-month and three-month cash until the middle of
2015.  “We continue to monitor closely money market conditions
and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance,”
Draghi said. “We are ready to consider all available
instruments.”  Germany ’s 10-year  yield  fell five basis points to 1.69
percent. The  two-year  rate dropped five basis points to 0.09
percent after declining to 0.05 percent, the least since May 31.  The German 10-year  break-even rate  dropped four basis
points to 1.52 percentage points, the lowest since June 25,
based on closing prices. The rate, a gauge of inflation
expectations, is derived from the yield difference between bunds
and index-linked securities.  Five-year inflation swap rates, a market gauge of price-growth expectations over that period, declined to 1.34 percent
on Nov. 1. That’s within one basis point of the level reached in
June last year, which was the lowest since December 2008. The
rate slid two basis points to 1.37 percent today.  The implied yield on Euribor contracts expiring in December
2014, a measure of the outlook for three-month money-market
rates, fell seven basis points to 0.34 percent, after dropping
to 0.27 percent.  Italian securities gained 6.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
returned 11 percent, while Germany’s lost 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
