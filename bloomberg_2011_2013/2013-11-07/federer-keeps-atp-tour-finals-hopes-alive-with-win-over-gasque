Six-time champion  Roger Federer  got
his first win at this year’s ATP World Tour Finals, beating
 Richard Gasquet  to keep alive his chances of qualifying for the
knockout stage of the tennis season-ending event.  The Swiss former No. 1 beat the Frenchman 6-4, 6-3 at
 London ’s O2 arena. Federer must now get past Juan Martin Del Potro in his final round-robin match in two days to have a
chance of advancing. He lost his opening Group B match to
tournament favorite Novak Djokovic.  The record 17-time Grand Slam winner broke Gasquet in the
third game and was never behind from that moment. The Frenchman
fought back with a break of his own to tie at 4-4, but Federer
immediately broke him again before serving out the first set.  Federer kept his momentum by winning Gasquet’s initial
service game of the second set. He served out the remainder of
the match, winning 68 percent of the points on his first serve.
He broke Gasquet a fourth time to win the match in an hour and
21 minutes.  Sixth-seeded Federer is making his 12th appearance at the
tournament between the top eight players, and has only once
failed to reach the semifinals.  Gasquet, seeded eight, has now lost two matches and must
beat Djokovic in two days to keep a hope of advancing.  Djokovic and  Del Potro  will play later today in the other
Group B match.  In the doubles, third seeds Ivan Dodig of  Croatia  and
Marcelo Melo of  Brazil  beat Polish pair Mariusz Fyrstenberg and
Marcin Matkowski 6-3, 3-6, 10-2 to top their group with two wins
out of two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
