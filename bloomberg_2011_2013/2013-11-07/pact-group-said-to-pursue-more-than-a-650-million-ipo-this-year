Pact Group Industries Pty, the
Australian packaging maker controlled by Raphael Geminder, is
pursuing an initial public offering that may raise more than
A$650 million ($616 million) this year, a person with knowledge
of the matter said.  Pact and its advisers will begin meeting investors next
week and publish a prospectus for the IPO before the end of the
month, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the
details are private. Geminder plans to keep about a 40 percent
stake in the packaging group, according to the person.  The Melbourne-based company was once part of the closely
held Visy Industries recycling business controlled by late
Australian billionaire Richard Pratt, whose daughter Fiona is
married to Geminder. It was formed in June 2002 and has plants
producing packaging for food, dairy, beverage, chemical and
industrial uses in  Australia , New Zealand and Asia, according to
its website.  The packaging group raised $885 million in senior debt in
May, according to a June 3 statement from Standard & Poor’s.  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Deutsche
Bank AG are advising Pact on the IPO, the person said. Geminder
considered a sale of about 50 percent of the company last year,
people familiar with the matter said in June 2012.  Pact’s IPO plans were reported earlier today by the Wall
Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
