The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
erased gains as telephone and consumer-staples companies led
losses following an early rally triggered by a cut in the
European Central Bank’s benchmark interest rate.  The S&P 500 was little changed at 1,770.12 at 9:55 a.m. in
New York after rising as high as 1,774.54, a record on a closing
basis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
