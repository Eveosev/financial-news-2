Tin shipments from  Indonesia  surged
more than estimated in October as buyers adjusted to a new trade
rule that’s designed to help the country displace the London
Metal Exchange as the venue for setting benchmark prices.
Futures fell to the lowest since Sept. 13.  Exports of ingots and solder rose to 4,070 metric tons from
786 tons in September, Trade Ministry data showed today. That
compares with the median estimate of 2,750 tons in a Bloomberg
survey, and 11,048 tons shipped in October 2012.  The government wants to challenge the LME as the market
that sets the global price of the metal used in smartphones and
packaging, ordering exporters from Aug. 30 to trade on a local
exchange before shipment. The rule forced PT Timah, the
country’s largest producer, to declare force majeure and pushed
futures to a six-month high. While it’s still early, the new
policy probably meets expectations and will be kept, according
to Deputy Trade Minister Bayu Krisnamurthi.  “Exports still need to be managed” from getting too high,
said Wilim Hadiwijaya, an analyst at PT Ciptadana Securities.
Shipments will keep rising as more companies join the Indonesia
Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, he said, estimating sales of
5,000 to 6,000 tons this month and next.  Trading on the  ICDX , the only bourse that’s allowed to
trade the metal before shipment, more than doubled to 3,020 tons
in October from September, exchange data show. Members that can
trade the metal rose to 28 from 12 on Aug. 30, ICDX said Oct.
30. That includes 16 producers and 12 buyers, it said.  Top Performer  “Yes, we are consistent,” Krisnamurthi told reporters in
Jakarta today, when asked if the policy will be kept. “If tin
is mined legally, we will facilitate it. If there are problems
in exchange membership, we will help. All in all, over a year,
the drop in shipments won’t be as much as everyone feared.”  Tin beat the five other main metals on the LME this year
amid forecasts for a global deficit, and after the Indonesian
rule change. Futures, which touched $24,000 a ton on Oct. 4,
fell 0.7 percent to $22,664 at 2:39 p.m. in  London  after earlier
today falling to $22,426 a ton.  The local-trade rule may help prices average $25,000 next
year, according to Stephen Briggs, an analyst at BNP Paribas SA
in London ranked by Bloomberg as the top forecaster over the
past eight quarters. The average so far this year is $22,207.  The exports in October, based on surveyors reports’ before
shipment, comprised of 3,314 tons of ingots and 756 tons of
solder, ministry data showed today. That compares with 400 tons
of ingots and 386 tons of solder in September.  Sales in the first 10 months of the year fell 11 percent to
72,858 tons compared with same period in 2012, according to
Bloomberg calculations. Shipments this quarter may drop 64
percent to 10,000 tons from a year ago, the median of estimates
from seven analysts and producers compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Timah -- based in Pangkalpinang, Bangka Belitung, the
country’s main producing area -- reported a drop in third-quarter net income after declaring force majeure.  Shares (TINS)  rose
1.9 percent to 1,590 rupiah in Jakarta.  To contact the reporters on this story:
