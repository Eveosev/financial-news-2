Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Europe ’s largest
investment bank by revenue, said it hired Kim Hammonds, chief
information officer of  Boeing Co. (BA)   Hammonds will start Nov. 25 and have the same title at
Deutsche Bank in addition to being co-head of its global
technology and operations unit, the Frankfurt-based bank said in
an e-mailed statement today. Hammonds replaces Anthony McCarthy,
who leaves Nov. 15 to pursue other career opportunities, it
said.  Deutsche Bank’s overhaul of its information technology
systems, as well as job cuts, are at the center of its plan to
reduce costs by 4.5 billion euros ($6 billion) annually by 2015.
The appointment of Hammonds may also help the firm reach a goal
of lifting the share of female senior executives to 25 percent
by the end of 2018.  Hammonds will report to Chief Operating Officer Henry Ritchotte and will work with Jim Turley, who remains co-head of
global technology and operations, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
