Global production of grain may be
bigger than estimated a month ago as prospects improved for
crops from Canada to  China  to the European Union, the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said.  Total output of grains, including wheat, rice, corn and
barley, will be 2.498 billion metric tons in the 2013-14 season,
0.3 percent more than forecast in October, the Rome-based FAO
said in a  report  today. The global wheat harvest will be a
record 708.5 million tons, up from 704.6 million tons estimated
a month ago and 7.4 percent more than last year.  Supplies of grain are rebounding globally as growing areas
in the U.S., eastern  Europe  and the former  Soviet Union  recover
from dry weather last year. China, the second-biggest corn
consumer, will reap 222.4 million tons of coarse grains, up 3.6
percent from last year. Wheat output in  Canada , the third
biggest exporter, will be a record 33.2 million tons, according
to the FAO.  The improved outlook is “mostly reflecting upward
adjustments to production estimates in Canada, China, EU, the
 United States  and Ukraine,” the FAO said. “The sharp increase
in 2013 cereal production mostly stems from a recovery of maize
crops in the United States” and wheat output in the former
Soviet Union, it said.  Wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade, the global benchmark,
has tumbled 16 percent this year. Corn futures plunged 40
percent, making the grain the worst-performing commodity so far
in 2013 on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials.
The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is scheduled to update its
estimates for domestic and world grain supplies tomorrow.  Import Bill  Rising supplies of grain mean the world’s food-import  bill 
will drop to $1.15 trillion in 2013, or 3.2 percent less than a
year earlier, the FAO said. The total was higher than the $1.09
trillion estimated in June. In a separate report today, the FAO
said global food prices rose in October for the first time in
six months, led by a jump in sugar costs.  World inventories of all grain may be 563.7 million tons at
the end of the 2013-14 season, including 166.7 million tons of
wheat. Both estimates were higher than forecast a month ago.
Global trade in grains may rise to 314.4 million tons, 1.7
percent more than the previous season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
