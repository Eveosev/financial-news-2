Anyone expecting U.S. stocks to
sustain their bull market has the index of leading economic
indicators on their side, according to  Dan Greenhaus , chief
global strategist at BTIG LLC.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the performance of the
Conference Board Leading Economic Index with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index during the past 20 years, as Greenhaus did
yesterday in a note to clients.  The economic barometer rose 0.7 percent in September to
97.1, the New York-based Conference Board said yesterday. The
gain surpassed economists’ median estimate of 0.6 percent in a
Bloomberg survey, and the latest reading was the highest since
April 2008. The index has fallen only once since September 2012.  “Those calling for a ‘top’ in equities are likely to be
thwarted a bit longer,” Greenhaus wrote, based on September’s
results. Although the leading index is partly based on the S&P
500, which soared 162 percent from its March 2009 low through
yesterday, the New York-based strategist wrote that the gauge
“has been a helpful indicator of stock price performance.”  The record for the economic index was set in March 2006,
and the S&P 500 concluded a five-year bull market the following
year. The previous peak was recorded in April 2000, weeks after
the end of a multiyear surge paced by Internet-related stocks.
Both highs are circled in the chart.  Along with the S&P 500, interest rates, jobless claims,
 consumer confidence  and manufacturing orders are among the 10
components of the Conference Board’s barometer. The index was
set to 100 in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
