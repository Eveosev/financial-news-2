ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest
steelmaker, is increasingly positive about next year’s outlook
after cost cuts and plant closings boosted profit 19 percent.  “The bottom of the cycle is behind us,” Chief Executive
Officer  Lakshmi Mittal  said. “Although operating conditions
remain challenging, as economic indicators are improving we are
cautiously optimistic about the prospects for 2014.”  Third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization rose to $1.71 billion from $1.45 billion a year
earlier, ArcelorMittal said in a statement. That beat the $1.53
billion average of 18 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company will lower costs by $3 billion by end-2015 to
counter excess European capacity. It shut plants at Liege in
Belgium and Florange in  France  and is reviewing sites in eastern
 Europe . Industry cuts are reining in surplus supply in Europe.
German steel trader  Kloeckner & Co SE (KCO)  yesterday reported a
doubling in profit after reducing costs, while  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) 
and  Salzgitter AG (SZG)  plan to lose a total of 2,800 jobs to 2018.  Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal rose 3.9 percent to close at
12.415 euros in Amsterdam, the highest level since Feb. 19.  “It’s a solid set of numbers,” said Luc Pez, an Exane BNP
Paribas analyst in Paris. “We don’t think it moves consensus
materially and neither is there anything overly surprising. But
the outlook commentary focuses on recovery and that’s what the
bulls want to see, so we would expect this share-price strength
to continue.”  Rising Demand  Chief Financial Officer  Aditya Mittal  said today he expects
steel use to rise in 2014 in Europe and the U.S., the company’s
biggest markets. Demand is set to fall by as much as 1 percent
in the U.S. and as much as 2.5 percent in Europe this year.  The steelmaker cut this year’s Ebitda target in August on
weaker steel demand than expected in both regions. ArcelorMittal
today reiterated full-year Ebitda of more than $6.5 billion. It
shipped 21.1 million metric tons of steel in the quarter, up 6
percent, and iron-ore output rose 4.5 percent to 14.9 million
tons. Steel shipments will grow 1 percent to 2 percent in 2013.  Net debt rose to $17.8 billion by end-September and will be
$17 billion next quarter.  ArcelorMittal (MT)  plans to lower borrowing
after its ratings were cut to below investment grade by Moody’s
Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corp. and Fitch Ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
