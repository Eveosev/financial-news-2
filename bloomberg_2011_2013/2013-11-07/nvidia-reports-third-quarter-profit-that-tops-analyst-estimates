Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) , a maker of graphics
processors, reported fiscal third-quarter profit that exceeded
analysts’ estimates as revenue from new businesses helped make
up for declining personal-computer demand.  Profit before certain costs was 26 cents a share in the
period that ended Oct. 27, the company said in a statement
today. That compared with an average analyst projection of 25
cents. Net income fell to $118.7 million, or 20 cents a share,
from $209.1 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier.  Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang is trying to lessen
Nvidia’s dependence on PCs by getting the company’s products
into new markets, such as handheld gaming devices and servers.
Sales of Tegra, a chip for mobile phones and the basis of
Shield, a portable gaming machine Nvidia is building and selling
itself, helped compensate for weaker sales of chips for laptops.  “We did see a nice bounce back in Tegra,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. She has
the equivalent of a buy  rating  on the stock. “Expectations were
pretty low,” for earnings and forecasts, she said.  Sales declined 12 percent to $1.05 billion, in line with
analysts’ estimates.  Nvidia  shares  rose as much as 4.2 percent in extended
trading. The stock declined 2.4 percent to $14.55 at the close
in  New York , leaving it up 19 percent this year.  Fourth-Quarter Outlook  Revenue will be $1.05 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, in
the fiscal fourth quarter ending in January, the  Santa Clara ,
California-based company said in the statement. That indicates
sales of $1.03 billion to $1.07 billion, lower than the  average 
analyst estimate of $1.08 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after
deducting production costs, will be 54.2 percent in the fiscal
fourth quarter, Nvidia said.  The company said it is increasing its quarterly  dividend 
payment to 8.5 cents a share from 7.5 cents, and added $1
billion to its stock repurchase program. It has a total of $1.29
billion available for buying its own shares before January 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
