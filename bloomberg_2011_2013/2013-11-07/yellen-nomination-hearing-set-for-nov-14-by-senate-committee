The Senate Banking Committee plans to
hold a nomination hearing for Federal Reserve Chairman candidate
 Janet Yellen  on Nov. 14.  Yellen, the current vice chairman of the Fed, was nominated
by President Barack Obama last month to succeed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , whose term ends Jan. 31. The hearing is scheduled to
begin at 10 a.m., according to a schedule released today by e-mail by the committee.  Yellen’s nomination must be approved by the committee
before it moves to the Senate floor. Democrats control 12 of the
committee’s 22 votes, enough to advance her nomination without
any Republican support.  Yellen last week began meeting one-on-one with committee
members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
