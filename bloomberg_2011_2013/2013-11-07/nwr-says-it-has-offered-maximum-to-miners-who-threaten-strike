New World Resources NV, the largest
Czech producer of coal for steelmakers, made its best offer
possible in wage negotiations with miners who are threatening to
go on strike.  The workers are voting on whether to walk out and are
scheduled to announce the outcome tomorrow. The company, whose
personnel costs represent 50 percent of its spending, can no
longer guarantee benefits such as year-end bonuses that equal
two months’ pay, Jan Fabian, the Chief Executive Officer of
NWR’s main unit OKD, told financial website Patria.  “We’ve really made a lot of concessions, and at this point
we are at a maximum of what we can offer our employees,” Fabian
said in an interview with Patria. “We cannot maintain all the
benefits that were granted at a time when coal prices were at a
record high.”  The company, which operates four active mines in the  Czech
Republic  and has two projects under development in  Poland ,
reported its fourth loss in a row yesterday as it battles a drop
in coal prices and shrinking demand from steelmakers. It has
pledged to shut down the unprofitable Paskov mine and
renegotiate a collective wage agreement with unions by year-end.  NWR has not given up on the Polish Debiensko project it put
on hold last year, according to the executive. Its future
depends on the development of coking coal prices, which are
unlikely to return to levels seen in previous years, he said.  The company’s shares rose 4.23 percent at 3:45 p.m. in
Prague, extending yesterday’s gain of 5.4 percent. The stock has
lost 71 percent of its value this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
