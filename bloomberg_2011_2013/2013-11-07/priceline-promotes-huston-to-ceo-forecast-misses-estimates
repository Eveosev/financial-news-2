Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the largest U.S.
online travel agent, reported sales that topped analysts’
estimates and promoted Darren Huston to chief executive officer,
ending Jeffery Boyd’s 11-year reign that saw the stock jump 100-fold.  Huston, head of Priceline’s Booking.com unit, will take the
helm and join the board, and Boyd will stay as chairman, the
company said in a statement today. Third-quarter sales rose 33
percent to $2.27 billion, topping  analysts ’ average estimate of
$2.22 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Under Boyd’s leadership, Norwalk, Connecticut-based
Priceline has raced ahead of competitors such as  Expedia Inc. (EXPE) ,
propelled by growth in Europe, where hotels were slower to move
reservations to the Web. Boyd orchestrated the 2005 acquisition
of Amsterdam-based Booking.com, which now accounts for more than
80 percent of Priceline’s bookings.  “We expect Priceline’s share price to increase over the
near term as it continues to experience solid revenue and
earnings growth,” Edward Woo, an analyst at Ascendiant Capital
Markets, wrote in a report last week.  Priceline shares rose as much as 4.8 percent to $1,072 in
extended trading, after falling 3.3 percent to $1,022.89 at the
close in New York. The  stock  has jumped 65 percent this year,
while Expedia has declined 4.1 percent. Following the earnings
report, Priceline shares initially dropped on a fourth-quarter
profit forecast that fell short of analysts’ projections.  Stock Surge  Boyd has been CEO of Priceline since 2002, overseeing a
surge in sales and profit and helping bolster the stock from
about $10 to more than $1,000. He moved the company from a U.S.
site for reserving flights and some other offerings to the
dominant service for booking hotels, the most profitable side of
online travel.  Huston will become CEO and join the board Jan. 1. He moved
to Booking.com in 2011 from  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   Priceline’s third-quarter net income jumped 40 percent to
$833 million, or $15.72 a share, from $596.6 million, or $11.66,
a year earlier.  Profit, excluding some items, will be $7.80 to $8.30 a
share in the current period, trailing the $8.34 average analyst
projection, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
