Mexican  consumer prices  rose in
October by the most in seven months as energy costs increased
and the central bank cut  interest rates .  Prices climbed 0.48 percent from a month earlier, compared
with the 0.46 percent median forecast of 20 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Annual inflation  slowed to 3.36 percent, the
least since January, from 3.39 percent in September.  The central bank yesterday raised its forecast for
inflation next year to 3.5 percent, a week after Governor
Agustin Carstens said policy makers shouldn’t reduce  interest
rates  from the current record low because tax increases will add
to pressure on prices in the short term. The central bank’s
board cut the benchmark interest rate a quarter percentage point
to 3.5 percent on Oct. 25 and signaled that the move will be the
last reduction in borrowing costs.  “Taking into consideration the impact of the fiscal
reform, a rate below 3.5 percent at this time, is not necessary,
adequate for the convergence” of inflation to the central
bank’s 3 percent target, Carstens said in an Oct. 30 interview.  Congress last week approved an 8 percent levy on junk food,
a 1 peso-per-liter duty on sugary drinks, and raised sales taxes
at the border to 16 percent from 11 percent.  Growth Forecast  While the central bank yesterday cut its growth forecast
for this year to between 0.9 percent and 1.4 percent from 2
percent to 3 percent, it raised the inflation estimate for next
year to 3.5 percent from near 3 percent, citing the tax
increases.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 13.1270 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:13 a.m. in Mexico City. Yields on fixed-rate government peso
bonds due in December 2014 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.64 percent.  Retail sales and industrial production unexpectedly fell in
August from the year earlier, adding to signs that economic
weakness from the first half of the year continued in the third
quarter.  “The risks to the downside for growth in the Mexican
economy, while they are less than in the most recent months,
remain elevated,” the central bank said in yesterday’s
quarterly inflation report.  Energy costs increased 4.3 percent in October from the
previous month and fruits and vegetables rose 0.3 percent, while
prices for livestock fell 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
