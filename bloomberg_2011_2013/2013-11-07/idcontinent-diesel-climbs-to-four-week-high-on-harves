U.S. Midcontinent diesel climbed to a
 four-week high  relative to futures as the corn harvest
progressed at the fastest pace since 2008, boosting demand for
fuel that powers farm equipment.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in Group 3, the region spanning
north from Tulsa,  Oklahoma , to Minnesota and  North Dakota , added
2 cents to 2.25 cents a gallon below New York Mercantile
Exchange futures at 3:59 p.m., the strongest level since Oct. 9,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  About  73 percent  of the U.S. corn crop was harvested as of
Nov. 3, up from 59 percent a week earlier, according to the U.S.
Agricultural Department. The increase was the largest for the
period in five years.  Stockpiles of  distillate fuel  in the U.S. Midwest, known as
PADD 2, fell 1.53 million barrels to 26.3 million last week, the
U.S. Energy Information Administration reported yesterday, the
 lowest level  since Dec. 12.  An outage at Citgo Petroleum Corp.â€™s 170,500-barrel-a-day
Lemont, Illinois, refinery may have contributed to the decline
in production. The plant reduced rates significantly after a
fire in October.  Diesel in the Midcontinent traded at a premium of 4.63
cents a gallon to the same fuel on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the
largest spread since Oct. 7. The Gulf Coast price strengthened
0.5 cent to 6.88 cents a gallon below futures.  Marathon Garyville  Gasoline climbed after the U.S. National Response Center
reported that  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  shut a unit at its
522,000-barrel-a-day Garyville, Louisiana, refinery.
Conventional, 87-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in the Gulf climbed
4.25 cents to 21.25 cents below futures after falling to a
three-month low yesterday.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing, Oklahoma, widened 18 cents to $8.72 a barrel. The same
spread in Group 3 slumped 66 cents to $7.90.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in  Los Angeles  and
 San Francisco  were unchanged against futures at premiums of 11.5
and 5.5 cents a gallon, respectively. Gasoline in  Portland ,
 Oregon , a benchmark for the U.S. Pacific Northwest, also held at
9.5 cents a gallon below futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
