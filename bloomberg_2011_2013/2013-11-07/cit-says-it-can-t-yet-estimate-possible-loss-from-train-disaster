CIT Group Inc. (CIT)  said it isn’t yet able
to estimate its possible losses from the fatal July derailment
of a train in Lac-Megantic,  Quebec , that included locomotives
and tank cars owned by the firm and leased to other companies.  Two of five locomotives in the derailment and nine of 72
tank cars belonged to a CIT subsidiary, the New York-based
business lender run by John Thain said yesterday in a filing.  The firm “cannot reasonably estimate the amount or range
of loss that may be incurred in connection with the
derailment,” because regulatory probes and lawsuits are
pending, CIT said. “The company is vigorously defending the
claims that have been asserted, including pursuing its rights
under indemnification agreements and insurance policies.”  Forty-seven people were killed after a runaway oil train
jumped the tracks and burst into flames on July 6. Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd., the train’s operator, said in
August that it was forced to file for bankruptcy because of
potential liability from the crash. CIT said the two locomotives
had been leased to that company.  “The derailment was a tragic event and we extend our
sympathies and condolences to all those impacted by the
incident,” said  Curt Ritter , a spokesman for CIT, in an e-mailed statement. “We do not comment on pending litigation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
