Geron Corp. (GERN)  gained the most in more
than a decade after the biotechnology company’s experimental
drug for myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disorder, helped patients
in a study.  Geron increased 45 percent to $5.21 at the close in New
York, its biggest single-day advance since September 2003. The
shares of the Menlo Park, California-based company have more
than tripled this year.  In the 18-patient study evaluating Geron’s medicine
imetelstat, 44 percent experienced clinical improvement, partial
remission or complete remission, according to  data  posted today.
That included four participants who had reversal of bone marrow
fibrosis, or scarring. The study was run by the Mayo Clinic with
funding from Geron.  “The efficacy data appears compelling and is certainly
sufficient for progression into a Geron-sponsored Phase 2
study,” Charles Duncan, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Co.,
wrote today in a research note. He raised his price target for
the shares to $10 from $6.  After a median follow-up of 3.2 months, 89 percent of
patients remained on Geron’s therapy, according to the data. The
study will be reported next month at the American Society of
Hematology meeting in New Orleans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
