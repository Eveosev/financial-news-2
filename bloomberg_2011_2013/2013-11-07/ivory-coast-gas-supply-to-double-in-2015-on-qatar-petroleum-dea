Qatar Petroleum will provide Ivory
Coast with natural gas starting in 2015, almost doubling the
amount of gas available in the West African nation.  State-run Qatar Petroleum will supply Ivory Coast with 240
million cubic feet of gas starting in 2015 from a floating
liquefied natural gas unit, Eddi Abrogouah, a technical adviser
at state-owned Petroci’s managing director, said yesterday in an
interview in Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s commercial capital. The
offshore terminal will be located 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) off
Grand-Bassam, he said. LNG is natural gas that’s been cooled to
a liquid state to make it easier to ship.  “The terminal will ensure the transition until we find big
natural gas reserves,” Abrogouah said.  Ivory Coast currently produces about 220 million cubic feet
of gas per day, 50 million cubic feet short of demand, Abrogouah
said. The rest of the supply will be used to fuel
ContourGlobal’s proposed 330 megawatt power plant in
Bingerville, near Abidjan. Construction of the plant is
scheduled to begin this year. The facility will eventually
produce as much as 1,000 megawatts, Abrogouah said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
