Windstorm Christian, known as the St.
Jude’s day storm in the U.K., may cost the  insurance industry 
between 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) and 2.3 billion euros,
catastrophe-modeling firm AIR Worldwide said.  The majority of insured losses occurred in  Denmark  and
 Germany , with further losses in the Netherlands,  France , the
U.K. and  Sweden , the Boston-based firm said in an e-mailed
statement today. AIR’s estimate is higher than the 800 million-euro to 1.3 billion-euro range analysts at Willis Re published
on Nov. 4.  The storm hit southern Britain on Oct. 28, knocking down
trees, flooding lowlands and disrupting travel, before moving
north and east, hitting France, the Netherlands, northern
Germany, Denmark, Sweden and  Russia .  “Christian produced record-setting wind speeds at several
meteorological stations, but the total wind damage was less
severe than that from the previously mentioned historical
storms,” Gerhard Zuba, senior principal scientist at the firm,
said in the statement.  Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , Europe’s second-biggest reinsurer, said
today it expects claims from the storm to be about $100 million.
 Aviva Plc (AV/) , Britain’s second-biggest insurer, said separately it
estimates the impact of the storm to be about 10 million pounds
($16 million), within the company’s budget for such events.  To contact the reporter on this story:
