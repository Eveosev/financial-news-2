Corn dropped for a seventh day to a
three-year low on speculation that the U.S. government will
increase its production estimate for the domestic crop tomorrow.  Corn for December delivery lost as much as 0.2 percent to
$4.2025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price
for a most-active contract since Aug. 25, 2010. Futures traded
at $4.205 by 11:10 a.m. Singapore time. A seventh day of
declines would be the worst run since July.  The grain has slumped 40 percent this year as output in the
U.S., the world’s biggest grower, recovers from the country’s
most-severe drought since the 1930s last year. The harvest may
reach a record 14.029 billion bushels, or 1.3 percent more than
the Department of Agriculture’s prediction in September and 30
percent larger than in 2012, according to a Bloomberg survey of
36 analysts.  “Expectations that the USDA will make a sizable upward
revision towards U.S. corn crop estimates has been the primary
factor weighing on that market,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , said by phone from
Sydney. “The market is certainly wanting to sit on its hands
and square off positions and await the USDA report.”  Wheat for December delivery was little changed at $6.53 a
bushel. Soybeans for January delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$12.5675 a bushel, climbing for a second day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
