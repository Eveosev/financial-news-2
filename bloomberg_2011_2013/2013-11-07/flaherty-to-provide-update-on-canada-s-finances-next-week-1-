Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  will release an update next week of his plan to bring
the nation’s budget back to balance by 2015.  Flaherty will deliver the update Nov. 12 at about 2:45 p.m.
 New York  time during an event in  Edmonton , Alberta.  The nation’s budget deficit has narrowed more quickly than
Flaherty forecast in his  2013 budget , delivered on March 21,
primarily because of an unexpected drop in operating and capital
spending.  Canada recorded a shortfall of C$18.9 billion ($18.1
billion) in the fiscal year that ended March 31, the Finance
Department said on Oct. 22. That figure is C$7 billion less than
Flaherty projected in the March budget, which also forecast a
deficit of C$18.7 billion for the current fiscal year before
swinging to a surplus in the 2015 fiscal year.  The government has promised legislation over the next two
years to end budget deficits once it returns to balance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
