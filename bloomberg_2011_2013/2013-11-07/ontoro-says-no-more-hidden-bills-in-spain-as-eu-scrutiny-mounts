Spanish regions and town halls have
no more hidden arrears, Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro said,
defending the integrity of the country’s financial statements
that have drawn scrutiny from the European Union.  “There are no more bills in the drawers,” Montoro said
during a speech in  Madrid  today.  Even so, local administrations continue to hire companies
for jobs, without having the budget, telling suppliers they will
be paid when the administration has the funds, Montoro said. The
government at its weekly meeting today will approve the details
of a third plan to bail out commercial suppliers who have not
been paid by town halls and regions, he added.  Officials from Eurostat, the EU’s statistical agency,
turned up the pressure on  Spain  with an extraordinary visit in
September to assess whether regional officials are complying
with recommendations to ensure their budget statements are
accurate. The mission included meetings with officials from
Valencia and Madrid, regions that failed to report all the
unpaid bills they had accumulated in 2011.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  says reining in spending by
the semi-autonomous regions has been a pillar in Spain’s
recovery as the economy expanded for the first time in more than
two years between July and September. The nation has
consistently missed EU budget targets since its deficit
surpassed 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
