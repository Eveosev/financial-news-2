 The former chief executive officer
of  New York â€™s  Hospital for Special Surgery , John R. Reynolds,
was sentenced to 18 months in prison for taking almost $300,000
in kickbacks from a subordinate and lying about it, federal
prosecutors said.  U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. sentenced Reynolds
today in a hearing in  Manhattan  federal court, the office of
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.  In July, Reynolds pleaded guilty to  wire fraud  and making
false statements, admitting that he took payments from a
hospital employee and lied to investigators about it.  Reynolds was arrested in September 2012 and charged with
taking part in a decade-long kickback scheme. Prosecutors
claimed that from 1996 to 2007, he took money from the hospital
employee and from at least two hospital vendors and an
unidentified health-care organization in the U.K. Reynolds left
the hospital in 2008, according to the government.  The Hospital for Special Surgery was founded in 1863 as the
Hospital for the Relief of the Ruptured and Crippled, according
to its  website .  The institution, which specializes in orthopedics, is known
for treating sports stars including New York Mets third baseman
 David Wright  and New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera.
Players for the  New York Giants , Knicks, Red Bulls and Liberty
are also treated there, according to the website.  The case is U.S. v. Reynolds, 12-cr-00708, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
