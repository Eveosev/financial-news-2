A  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  fund and  Prelios
SpA (PRS)  are in talks to sell about 18,000 homes in northern  Germany 
to  Immofinanz AG (IIA) ’s Buwog unit. The properties are valued at
about 942 million euros ($1.3 billion).  The acquisition would boost Buwog’s assets before an
initial public offering planned for next year, Immofinanz said
in a statement today. A deal may be reached by the end of next
month, the Vienna-based property company said.  Immofinanz has been adding German apartments as it prepares
to sell Buwog. Deutsche Bank and Prelios are seeking to profit
from demand for German homes as investors seek alternatives to
lower yielding fixed-income assets.  Asking prices for existing German apartments have gained
about 10 percent since 2007, according to data compiled by
Berlin-based online broker ImmobilienScout24.  The homes Buwog might buy are managed by DGAG
Wohnimmobilien GmbH. Prelios bought DGAG with 22,000 apartments
in 2007 for about 1.4 billion euros. The Deutsche Bank fund then
invested in the company and became a co-owner.  The valuation of DGAG’s apartments, made at the end of
June, was disclosed in Prelios’s second-half financial report.
They were financed with 683 million euros in debt and had a 2.2
percent vacancy rate. Prelios said the debt was due to mature at
the end of this year.  Prelios in December said it planned to gradually divest its
real estate holdings with the goal of focusing on property
servicing. That month, the company was one of a group of owners
that sold Berlin’s KaDeWe department store as part of a deal
valued at 1.1 billion euros.  Institutions including insurers, pension funds and private-equity firms may buy about 10 billion euros of German
residential buildings in 2013, according to data compiled by
broker  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  In 2012, they bought 11.1 billion
euros of homes, the most since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
