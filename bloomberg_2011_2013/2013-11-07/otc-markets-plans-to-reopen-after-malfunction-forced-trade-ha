OTC Markets Group Inc. plans to
reopen its market at 3 p.m. after a technology malfunction
prompted regulators to stop trading of over-the-counter stocks
for about three-and-a-half hours.  The OTC system was available after a “network provider
issue” was resolved, Chief Executive Officer Cromwell Coulson
said in an e-mail. The market will reopen pending a notice from
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, he said.  The halt affected over-the-counter equities such as Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, not companies listed by NYSE Euronext or
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. The pause began at 11:25 a.m.  New York 
time today, Finra said on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
