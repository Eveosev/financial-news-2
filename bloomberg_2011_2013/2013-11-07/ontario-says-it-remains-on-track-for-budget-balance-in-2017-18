Ontario kept a forecast for
eliminating a  budget deficit  in the 2017-18 fiscal year while
cutting its economic growth projection.  Canadaâ€™s largest provincial economy will grow 1.3 percent
this year and 2.1 percent next year, according to a budget
update presented by Finance Minister Charles Sousa in Toronto
today. Those rates are both 0.2 percentage point less than the
previous forecast. The budget update also kept in place a
forecast for a C$11.7 billion ($11.2 billion) deficit for the
fiscal year that began in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
