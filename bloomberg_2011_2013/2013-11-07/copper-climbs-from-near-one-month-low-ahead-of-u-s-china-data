Copper climbed after from the lowest
level in almost a month before the release of U.S. data that may
help investors gauge when the Federal Reserve will begin
tapering bond purchases and ahead of Chinese trade figures.  The contract for delivery in three months rose as much as
0.4 percent to $7,142 a metric ton and was at $7,138.25 at 10:48
a.m. in  Shanghai . Futures closed at $7,115 yesterday, the lowest
since Oct. 9. The metal has lost 10 percent this year.  The U.S. economy probably grew at a 2 percent annualized
rate in the third quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent increase
in the previous three months, according to a Bloomberg survey
before today’s report. Economists predict data tomorrow will
show payrolls climbed by 120,000 in October and the unemployment
rate increased to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent in the previous
month, according to a separate survey.  China , the world’s largest copper user, is scheduled to
announce its October trade balance tomorrow, followed by
inflation and industrial production data on Nov. 9. Chinese
Communist Party leaders will meet for four days starting Nov. 9
to discuss policies.  Futures for delivery in December increased 0.3 percent to
$3.2450 a pound on the Comex in New York. The metal for delivery
in January on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.4 percent to
51,380  yuan  ($8,432) a ton.  On the LME, zinc and aluminum rose while lead and nickel
were little changed. Tin hadn’t traded.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
