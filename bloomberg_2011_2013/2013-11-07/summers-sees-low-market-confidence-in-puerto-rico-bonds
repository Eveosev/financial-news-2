Former U.S. Treasury Secretary
 Lawrence Summers  said financial markets show a lack of
confidence in Puerto Rico’s economy, with its bonds trading as
the “junkiest of the junk.”  “There are profoundly serious financial issues facing
Puerto Rico right now,” Summers said today at the Continuity
Forum in  Miami Beach , Florida. “How that’s resolved is a very
important question for North America and for the Puerto Rican
community.”  Yields on Puerto Rican bonds maturing in 2041 climbed to as
much as 10.2 percent in September before falling to about 7.7
percent this week. The commonwealth’s bonds are widely held in
the $3.7 trillion municipal  bond market  because of their
exemption from local, state and U.S. federal taxes.  The commonwealth took in $865 million in revenue in
October, about 15 percent more than forecast, on higher
corporate-tax receipts, Treasury Secretary Melba Acosta said in
a Nov. 4 statement.  A default by Puerto Rico, which is rated one level above
junk status, is unlikely since its constitution gives priority
to general obligation bond payments over  government spending ,
Acosta said yesterday at the Bloomberg Link State & Municipal
Finance Conference in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
