The former chief executive officer of
the Bank of the Commonwealth was sentenced to 23 years in prison
and ordered to pay $333.6 million in restitution following his
conviction for bank fraud.  Edward J. Woodard, 70, was sentenced today, according to a
statement from the U.S. attorney’s office in Norfolk,  Virginia .  “Woodard’s felonious conduct, motivated by his own greed,
destroyed a financial institution, left former bank employees
jobless, and defrauded a federal recovery program out of
millions of dollars,” Acting U.S. Attorney Dana J. Boente said
in the statement.  Woodard, who ran the bank for more than three decades, was
found guilty in May after a 10-week  jury trial . The bank failed
in 2011, resulting in $333 million loss to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., according to the statement.  Andrew Sacks, a lawyer for Woodard, didn’t immediately
respond to a phone call after regular business hours seeking
comment on the sentence.  The case is U.S. v. Woodard, 12-cr-00105, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk).  To contact the reporter on this story:
