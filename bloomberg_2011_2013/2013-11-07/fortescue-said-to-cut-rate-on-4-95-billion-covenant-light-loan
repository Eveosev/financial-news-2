Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-biggest iron ore exporter, lowered the rate on
a $4.95 billion loan it’s seeking to refinance debt, according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The company will pay interest at 3.25 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, with a 1 percent
floor on the lending benchmark, compared with 3.75 percentage
points originally proposed, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  Fortescue is refinancing a $5 billion credit pact to cut
interest payments as iron ore prices are forecast to drop.
 Standard & Poor’s  yesterday increased the miner’s credit rating
to BB, or two levels below investment-grade, citing a continued
increase in production scale and cost reduction. S&P said its
outlook is “positive.”  The company’s existing loan was obtained last year and has
an interest rate of 4.25 percentage points more than Libor with
a 1 percent floor on the lending benchmark, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The new financing, being arranged by Credit Suisse Group
AG, is covenant-light, meaning it won’t have financial
maintenance requirements that help protect investors. Lenders
must submit their commitments to participate in the deal by 5
p.m. today, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
