Royal Bank of Scotland  Plc will pay
$153.7 million to resolve U.S. regulatory claims that a
brokerage unit misled investors in a 2007 financial product
linked to subprime mortgages.  RBS told investors that the loans backing the $2.2 billion
security “generally” met the lender’s underwriting guidelines
even though nearly 30 percent fell so short of the standards
that they should have been excluded, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement today.  The company’s  Stamford , Connecticut-based RBS Securities
Inc. unit, then known as Greenwich Capital Markets Inc., was
paid about $4.4 million for underwriting the transaction yet
only quickly reviewed the investment, the SEC said. RBS knew or
should have known that many of the loans did not meet the
lender’s underwriting standards, according to the statement.  “In its rush to meet a deadline set by the seller of these
loans, RBS cut corners and failed to complete adequate due
diligence, with predictable results,” George Canellos, co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement.  RBS said in a statement that it cooperated fully with the
SEC throughout the investigation and that the settlement
payments are covered by provisions the bank has already made. In
resolving the claims, RBS didn’t admit or deny wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
