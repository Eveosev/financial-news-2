Buyout firms will target European
retailers using non-investment grade debt to take advantage of
low funding costs as the region struggles to emerge from an
economic slump, Moody’s Investors Service said.  While retailers are unlikely to make acquisitions because
the economic recovery has yet to positively affect household
spending, about two thirds of funds raised for buyouts are “now
high yield, reflecting an increase in leveraged-buyouts in the
year and a low interest rate environment that supports the
funding of these transactions,” Moody’s European retail
analysts said in a report published today.  New ratings for debt “are likely to be high-yield” and
“we expect this trend to continue while borrowing costs remain
low,” Moody’s said.  Central banks have cut interest rates to record lows as
European companies and consumers struggle with the fallout from
the sovereign debt crisis and record high unemployment. Even so,
retail sales in the euro region and the U.K. will grow by as
much as 1 percent by the second half of 2014,, backed by
“modest GDP growth,” Moody’s said.  The recovery will probably be uneven, with a pick-up in the
U.K.,  Germany  and  France  offset by a lag in Spain, Italy and
Greece, according to Moody’s.  That will “weigh on earnings for companies with operations
in those areas such as” French hypermarket operator  Carrefour
SA (CA)  and electronics retailer  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS) , the ratings
company said.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are
expected to keep interest rates at record lows of 0.5 percent
each when policy makers meet in Frankfurt and  London  tomorrow,
according to two Bloomberg surveys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
