Curtis Green, the administrator of
Silk Road, the online black market for drugs and other
contraband, pleaded guilty to a cocaine conspiracy charge,
according to federal prosecutors in  Maryland .  Green, 47, of  Utah , helped an undercover agent for the U.S.
 Drug Enforcement Administration  arrange the purchase of one
kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cocaine for about $27,000 in the
digital currency Bitcoin from a drug vendor on Silk Road,
prosecutors said in papers unsealed yesterday in federal court
in Baltimore.  “People who believe they can commit crimes anonymously
using the Internet should reconsider,” Rod Rosenstein, U.S.
attorney for the District of Maryland, said in a statement
announcing the guilty plea.  Jacob George IV, 32, of Edgewood, Maryland, pleaded guilty
on Nov. 5 to conspiracy to distribute drugs, including heroin,
via Silk Road. The website was set up by Ross Ulbricht, 29, also
known as Dread Pirate Roberts, U.S. prosecutors say.  Ulbricht, of  San Francisco , has been indicted in Maryland
on multiple charges, including attempted witness murder, and
faces additional charges in  New York .  The case against Green is U.S. v. Green,13-cr-00592, U.S.
District Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore).  To contact the reporter on this story:
