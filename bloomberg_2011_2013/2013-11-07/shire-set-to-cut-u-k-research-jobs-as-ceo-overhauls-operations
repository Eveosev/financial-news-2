Shire Plc (SHP)  plans to cut U.K. research
jobs and will move its Swiss operations as part of a
reorganization at the drugmaker led by Chief Executive Officer
Flemming Ornskov.  About 180 employees at Shire’s U.K. headquarters in
Basingstoke may be affected, a spokesman said by e-mail. The
company also plans to move its Swiss operations from Eysins to
Zug and has begun consultations with workers, the Dublin-based
company said today in a  statement  on its website.  Shire plans to “discontinue a number of programs outside
of rare diseases” and will focus on drug projects that have the
best chance of clinical and commercial success, the company
said. This will result in a significant decrease in the amount
of research and development in Basingstoke,  England , the company
said. A small number of functional roles may also be affected,
the company said.  Shire was little changed at 2,831 pence at 1:35 p.m. in
London trading. The stock rose to a record  this month , helped by
earlier-than-expected positive data on its best-selling Vyvanse
pill to treat binge-eating disorder.  Ornskov, who took over in May, has said his overhaul,
dubbed One Shire, has already streamlined operations and reduced
costs.  “We are making Shire a leaner and more productive
organization with a reset cost base,” he said on Oct. 24 after
reporting third-quarter earnings.  About 520 of Shire’s 5,500 employees are based in the U.K.,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
