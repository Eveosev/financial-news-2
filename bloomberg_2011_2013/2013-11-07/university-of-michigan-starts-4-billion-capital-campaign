The  University of Michigan  aims to
raise $4 billion in a capital campaign, which would represent
the largest effort in history by a public U.S. university.  The school in  Ann Arbor , with more than 43,000 students,
already raised $1.7 billion toward the goal during a two-year
“silent phase,” according to a  statement  today. Priorities for
the funds include student support so that every student accepted
can afford to attend, engaged learning and “bold ideas.”  Real estate developer Stephen Ross, who has donated more
than $313 million to the university including a $200 million
gift in September, is chairman of the campaign. Michigan has
also received donations or pledges this year of $110 million
from Charles Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.;
$50 million from Helen Zell, wife of billionaire investor  Sam
Zell ; and $50 million from Tomay Inc. President Richard Rogel
and his wife Susan.  Among private schools, Harvard University began a $6.5
billion capital campaign in September, the largest in the
history of higher education, public or private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
