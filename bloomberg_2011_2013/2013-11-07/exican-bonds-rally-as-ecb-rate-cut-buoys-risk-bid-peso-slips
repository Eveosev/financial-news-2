Mexico benchmark local-currency bonds
rallied, pushing yields down the most in two weeks, after
Europe’s surprise reduction in borrowing costs spurred demand
for higher-yielding peso assets.  Yields on the securities due in 2024 fell six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.09 percent at 9:51 a.m. in Mexico
City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso dropped
less than 0.1 percent to 13.1805 per U.S. dollar.  Bonds climbed after the European Central Bank cut its main
refinancing rate today by a quarter-percentage point to 0.25
percent, a decision forecast by only three of 70 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Foreign investors increased holdings of
the Mexican bonds known as Mbonos to a record high last month as
the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its $85 billion in monthly
asset purchases to support the economy.  “It’s global liquidity,” Kevin Daly, who helps oversee
about $10 billion in emerging-market debt including Mexican
government bonds at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, said in a
telephone interview from  London . “It’s just all positive for
risk assets, so that explains why Mbonos are rallying with
pretty much everything else today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
