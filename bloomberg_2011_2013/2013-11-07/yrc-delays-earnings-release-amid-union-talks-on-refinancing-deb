YRC Worldwide Inc. (YRCW) , a struggling U.S.
trucker, delayed its earnings release scheduled for tomorrow
amid talks on a new labor agreement that the company says is key
to refinancing debt.  YRC, based in Overland Park,  Kansas , plans to enter formal
negotiation to extend the union labor agreement and “increase
its competitiveness in the market,” the company said in a
statement today. The developments resulted in the company
postponing its earnings release to Nov. 12, YRC said.  Reaching an agreement with the union “will substantially
increase the likelihood of a holistic refinancing solution to
address the debt maturities in 2014 and 2015,” said Chief
Executive Officer James Welch said in the statement.  Welch and Chief Financial Officer Jamie Pierson met with
Teamsters leaders yesterday in  Dallas  to discuss the challenges
for refinancing. An agreement would secure jobs for more than
26,000 union workers, Welch said in today’s statement.  YRC has $1.4 billion in total debt. About $396 million of
debt matures next year and another $548 million is due in 2015,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company has posted
annual losses since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
