Asian  stocks  fell as investors await
economic data from the U.S. and amid concern gains in equities
over the past two months have outpaced prospects for earnings.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, lost 1.3
percent in  Tokyo  after its net-income forecast fell short of
estimates.  Ausdrill (ASL)  Ltd. slumped 29 percent in Sydney after the

as of 4:44 p.m. in Hong Kong, with all 10 industry groups on the
gauge falling. The measure rose 9.3 percent this year through
yesterday amid unprecedented stimulus from the Bank of Japan and
optimism the Federal Reserve will continue its monthly bond
buying into 2014.  “It is hard to see where the global economy can surprise
significantly on the upside to provide a further leg up for
major indexes,” Matthew Sherwood, head of investment markets
research in Sydney at Perpetual Investments, which manages about
$25 billion, said in an e-mail. “The markets have bid prices up
and are likely to ‘side trend’ for a period, so that earnings
can catch up with investor optimism.”  Japan’s  Topix index  declined 0.6 percent.  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.2 percent, dragged lower by lenders as
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and National
Australia Bank Ltd. traded without the right to the current
dividend.  Asian Earnings  New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.4 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi Index and China’s Shanghai Composite Index both fell 0.5
percent. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  declined 0.7 percent.
Taiwan’s Taiex index was little changed, while  Singapore ’s
Straits Times Index fell 0.2 percent.  U.S. growth and jobs data to be released today may help
investors gauge the time line for stimulus cuts after two
Federal Reserve officials said the level of slack in the economy
justifies continuing accommodative policy.  Of the companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that have
reported quarterly results this season and for which Bloomberg
compiles estimates, about half  exceeded  analysts’ projections on
profit, while 53 percent posted better-than-expected revenue.  The Asia-Pacific gauge climbed the past two months, pushing
valuations on the measure to 13.7 times  estimated earnings , up
from a multiple of 12.7 at the end of August, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a current multiple of
16 on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 15 for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, the data show.  China Reforms  China ’s leaders meet in Beijing from Nov. 9-12 to map out a
blueprint for reform. A private survey this week showed services
industries expanded after an official non-manufacturing gauge
rose to the highest this year.  Futures on the S&P 500 slid 0.1 percent. Yesterday, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 percent to a record and the
S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent. Microsoft Corp. climbed 4.2 percent
as Nomura Holdings Inc. said the software company may exit its
money-losing consumer business under a new chief executive
officer.  The U.S. economy probably grew at a 2 percent annualized
rate in the third quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent increase
in the previous three months, according to a Bloomberg survey
before today’s report. Economists predict data will show
payrolls climbed by 120,000 in October and the unemployment rate

million to A$45 million ($33.2 million to $42.7 million) in the
