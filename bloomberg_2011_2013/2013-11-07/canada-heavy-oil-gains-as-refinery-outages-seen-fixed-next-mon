Canadian heavy crude gained for a
second day on the  spot market  as refinery equipment failures
that weakened demand may be partly resolved by next month.  The Federated Co-operative Ltd. refinery in Regina,
Saskatchewan, is expected to complete repairs to equipment that
processes heavy crude “within a few weeks,” Daryl Oshanek, a
spokesman based in Saskatoon, said in an e-mail yesterday. The
refinery, which normally processes as much as 60,000 barrels a
day of heavy oil, shut down equipment after a Nov. 1 fire.  Western Canadian Select heavy crude for December delivery
strengthened by $1 a barrel to a $40 discount to U.S. West Texas
Intermediate oil, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy
Inc. November spot deliveries weakened 10 cents to a $43.10
discount.  WCS, the benchmark grade for production from the Canadian
oil-sands, weakened over the past two weeks due to the Regina
outage and after Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Lemont,  Illinois ,
 refinery  shut a crude unit after a fire on Oct. 23. The 170,500-barrel-a-day refinery is expected to restart the unit at reduced
rates by the end of this week, the company said in an Oct. 28
statement.  WCS has weakened from a $31.90 discount at the end of
September, and has traded at an average of $23.64 a barrel below
West Texas Intermediate this year.  Syncrude Canadian light crude oil gained 15 cents to a
$14.75 discount to WTI, Net Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
