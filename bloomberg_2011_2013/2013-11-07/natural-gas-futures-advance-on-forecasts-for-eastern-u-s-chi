Natural gas futures gained for a
third day in  New York  on forecasts for colder-than-normal
weather that would stoke demand for the heating fuel.  Gas climbed as much as 2.7 percent as MDA Weather Services
in Gaithersburg, Maryland, said temperatures may be below-average in the eastern half of the U.S. through Nov. 16. The low
in New York on Nov. 14 may be 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 Celsius),
10 less than usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State
College , Pennsylvania.  “It seems like there’s going to be more heating demand
coming down the line,” said Victor Zevallos, an energy trader
at FCStone Latin America LLC in Miami. “The forecasts are
looking pretty cold for the next couple of weeks.”  Natural gas for December delivery rose 10.1 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $3.599 per million British thermal units at 9:03
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was
more than double the average for the time of day. Prices have
climbed 7.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
