Truworths International Ltd. (TRU) , South
Africa’s largest listed clothing retailer, fell the most in more
than three months as inflationary pressure curbed consumer
spending and slowed its sales growth.  The stock  slid  as much as 6.3 percent to 86.65 rand and
traded 5.9 percent lower at 12:49 p.m in Johannesburg. About 3
million shares traded, twice the three-month daily average.
Truworths was the worst performer on the 11-member FTSE/JSE
Africa General Retailers Index today.  South African  consumer confidence  reached a 10-year low in
the three months through September as inflationary pressures
curbed spending and demand for credit. Truworths sales for the
18 weeks through Nov. 3 rose 7 percent to 3.5 billion rand ($341
million), compared with a 15.9 percent increase a year earlier,
the Cape Town-based company said today in a statement. Credit
sales accounted for 71 percent of revenue, with like-for-like
store sales rising 2 percent.  “It’s becoming increasingly difficult for credit
retailers,” Roger Tejwani, a retail analyst at NOAH Capital
Markets, who has a sell recommendation on Truworths, said by
phone from  Cape Town . “Their debtor costs have grown and they
are facing increasing competition from international brands.”  Truworths shares have dropped 20 percent this year compared
with a 9.4 percent decline in the retailers’ gauge. The FTSE/JSE
Africa  All-Share Index (JALSH)  has rallied 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
