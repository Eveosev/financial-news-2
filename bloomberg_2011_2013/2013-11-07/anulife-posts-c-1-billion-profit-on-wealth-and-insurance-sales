Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest life insurer by market value, posted third-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as wealth and insurance
product sales increased.  Net income was C$1.03 billion ($993 million), or 54 cents a
share, compared with a loss of C$227 million, or 14 cents, a
year earlier, the Toronto-based firm said today in a statement.
Profit excluding some items was 36 cents a share, compared with
the 35-cent average estimate of 12 analysts  surveyed  by
Bloomberg.  “Insurance sales increased modestly, but most importantly,
were accompanied by much higher margins,” Chief Executive
Officer Donald Guloien, 56, said in the statement. “Wealth
sales were extremely positive across the board. The overall plan
is unfolding extremely well.”  The insurer’s wealth product sales gained 34 percent to
C$11.3 billion from the same period last year, with the
company’s funds under management reaching a record of C$575
billion. Insurance sales were up 4 percent.  Manulife gained 0.2 percent to C$18.71 in Toronto
yesterday. It has  rallied  38 percent this year, beating the 34
percent gain by the 6-company Standard & Poor’s/TSX Life &
Health Insurance Index.  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , Canada’s third-largest insurer,
said yesterday that net income from continuing operations
slipped 27 percent to C$324 million. Operating profit, which
excludes some items, was 69 cents a share, beating the 64-cent
average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Wealth-management and insurance sales rose.  (Manulife is hosting an investor conference call at 2 p.m.
