Novak Djokovic, the second seed from
Serbia, advanced to the semifinals of the season-ending ATP
World Tour Finals with a three-set defeat of Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina.  Djokovic won 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Having beaten six-time champion
 Roger Federer  in the first round of the tournament at the O2
Arena in London, Djokovic joined top-ranked  Rafael Nadal  in the
semifinals with his win. Federer, who defeated France’s Richard Gasquet 6-4, 6-3 in an afternoon match, will play del Potro in
two days for the other semifinal spot from group B.  The tournament brings together the top eight men for a
season finale. Djokovic is the defending champion, while Nadal’s
best finish is a loss to Federer in the 2010 final.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
