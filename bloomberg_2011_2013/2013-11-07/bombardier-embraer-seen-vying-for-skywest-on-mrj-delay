Embraer SA (ERJ)  and  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  may
stand to gain business after  SkyWest Inc. (SKYW) , a commuter partner
for carriers including  United Airlines , voiced frustration with
delays for  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) ’s new regional jet.  The tardy debut for the plane known as the MRJ creates
opportunities for both Bombardier and Embraer, which already
supply aircraft to SkyWest, said  Chris Murray , an analyst at
AltaCorp Capital Inc. in Toronto. Last year, SkyWest ordered 100
Mitsubishi jets, a competitor to Bombardier and Embraer models.  “Both would go out of their way to accommodate” an order
from  St. George , Utah-based SkyWest, Murray said today in a
telephone interview.  SkyWest’s comments yesterday about the second postponement
for the 78- to 92-seat MRJ signal the risk of a cancellation,
said Robert Stallard, an RBC Capital Markets analyst. Mitsubishi
said in August that deliveries would be deferred about 15 months
to 2017’s second quarter, which probably pushes SkyWest’s first
jet into 2018, Stallard wrote in a note to clients.  “The folks at Mitsubishi have to deliver all the airplane
as advertised and they need to do it in a time frame that makes
sense for us,” SkyWest President Bradford Rich told analysts on
a conference call. While SkyWest remains committed to the MRJ,
“if that doesn’t happen, then of course, we have no financial
obligations or commitments to take the type.”  Chief Executive Officer Jerry Atkin, speaking on a call
today, said SkyWest’s MRJ delivery slots would start in 2018
without giving a month.  SkyWest, Planemakers  Jessica Bowers, a SkyWest spokeswoman, said she couldn’t
immediately respond to questions on whether the airline was
considering modifying the MRJ contract, or whether the carrier
was speaking to other planemakers.  Phone messages left for comment about SkyWest with
Bombardier and  Sao Jose dos Campos , Brazil-based Embraer weren’t
immediately returned. Hirofumi Takahashi, a U.S. spokesman for
the aviation unit of Tokyo-based Mitsubishi, said he couldn’t
immediately comment.  The MRJ is Mitsubishi’s effort to challenge the dominance
of regional-jet builders Embraer and Bombardier, which started
producing the planes in the 1990s. In 2012, Mitsubishi said the
first flight was late while it confirmed manufacturing processes
and finished technical studies.  Bombardier had long been SkyWest’s chief aircraft supplier.
Last year, the airline ordered the MRJs, and this year, it
agreed to buy 100 of Embraer’s upgraded E175 jets, with options
for 100 more. SkyWest also flies  Embraer turboprops .  If Skywest were interested in buying a current-generation
plane as an MRJ alternative, Montreal-based Bombardier would be
very interested, said David Tyerman, analyst at Canaccord
Genuity in Toronto who has a buy recommendation on the Canadian
planemaker.  “If they want to go next-gen then I’d believe Embraer
would be in the driver’s seat,” Tyerman said.  Mitsubishi’s jets were attractive to SkyWest because they
use newer engine technology, making them more fuel efficient,
said Tyerman. Bombardier doesn’t have an upgraded jet of the
same size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
