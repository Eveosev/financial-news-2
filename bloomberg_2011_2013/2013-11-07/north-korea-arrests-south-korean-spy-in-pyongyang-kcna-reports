North Korea  said it arrested a South
Korean spy who was trying to foment instability, creating a new
irritant in ties between the two adversaries.  The South Korean intelligence agent was detained in
Pyongyang and at first claimed to be Chinese, the state-run
Korean  Central News Agency  said yesterday, citing an
unidentified spokesman for the Ministry of State Security.  “He entered the DPRK to rally dishonest elements within
the boundary of the DPRK and use them for undermining the
stability of the social system,” KCNA said, referring to the
North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea.  The arrest may further sour ties that hit a low in February
when North  Korea  tested its third atomic device and then
threatened nuclear strikes against the U.S. and  South Korea  over
United Nations sanctions. On Nov. 6, North Korea rejected the
idea of a summit after South Korean President Park Geun Hye said
she was willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if it
led to concrete results.  Two South Korean Unification Ministry officials didn’t
immediately answer calls after working hours yesterday seeking
comment about the KCNA report. Last month, the North repatriated
six detained South Koreans.  The North Korean ministry spokesman said that before
entering Pyongyang, the alleged spy had spent nearly six years
spying on the North from a neighboring country while
“disguising himself as a religionist.”  The two Koreas remain technically in conflict after the
1950-53  Korean War  ended without a formal peace treaty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
