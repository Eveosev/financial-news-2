The income return on  Taiwan ’s
foreign-exchange reserves, the world’s sixth-largest stockpile,
halved since 2008 as more than $3 trillion of debt purchases by
the Federal Reserve drove U.S. Treasury yields to record lows.  The holdings, which totaled a record $415.6 billion at the
end of October, delivered interest returns of 2.8 percent to 3.8
percent in the last five years, down from about 6.7 percent six
years ago, according to Hsueh Ling, co-convener of the
Legislative  Yuan ’s Finance Committee, citing a presentation she
saw during a visit to the central bank this week.  Taiwan  owned  $183.6 billion of Treasuries at the end of
August, making it the third-biggest foreign holder of the
securities, according to U.S. government data.  China  had $1.27
trillion and  Japan  $1.15 trillion. The rate on benchmark 10-year
U.S. Treasuries  fell  167 basis points in the past six years to
2.64 percent, as the Fed bought government bonds to lower
borrowing costs and spur growth.  “Taiwan doesn’t have a sovereign wealth fund and the
central bank can only buy fixed-income assets, so though U.S.
Treasuries aren’t great, at least there’s no default risk,”
said Scott Cheng, a Taipei-based economist at Bank SinoPac.
“The central bank also has to buy back U.S. dollars in the
market to intervene and absorb foreign currency, owing to
Taiwan’s large trade surplus.”  Long-Term Investor  The monetary authority has sold the local dollar on most
days since March 2012, according to traders who asked not to be
identified. Taiwan’s dollar has declined 1.3 percent this year
to NT$29.407 against its U.S. counterpart. The island posted a
trade  surplus  of $2.35 billion in September.  U.S. sovereign bonds are still the best in the world, Perng
Fai-nan, Taiwan’s central bank governor, said Oct. 2. As the
monetary authority is a long-term investor, the data isn’t
marked-to-market and only reflects interest returns, it said in
an emailed statement. The data was provided to lawmakers on Nov.
4, the monetary authority said.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt from December 2008 to
June 2011 and in September 2012 announced open-ended purchases
of $85 billion a month to keep borrowing costs low and support a
recovery in the world’s largest economy. The 10-year Treasury
yield sank to an all-time low of 1.38 percent in July 2012,
having averaged 3.64 percent in 2008.  The Fed will taper its unprecedented stimulus in March,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey conducted Oct. 17-18. The yield on 10-year
Treasuries will climb 32 basis points to 2.96 percent by end-March, a separate survey showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
