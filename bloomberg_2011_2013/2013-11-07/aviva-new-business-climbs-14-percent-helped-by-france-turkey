Aviva Plc (AV/) , the U.K.’s second-biggest
insurer by market value, said the value of new business climbed
14 percent in the first nine months of the year, boosted by
higher sales in Europe and Asia.  New business rose to 571 million pounds ($918 million
pounds) from 503 million pounds in the nine months to Sept. 30.
the London-based company said in a statement today. Business
climbed 33 percent in  France , 40 percent in  Turkey  and by 43
percent in Asia.  “Progress is in line with our expectations and we remain
focused on delivering  cash flow  plus growth,” Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Wilson  said in the statement. “Aviva remains in
the early stages of turnaround.”  Wilson, who succeeded  Andrew Moss  this year, is seeking to
appease investors by selling assets and cutting costs to help
rebuild capital depleted by the financial crisis and shrink a
5.1 billion-pound internal loan. The size of the loan remained
unchanged in the period. The insurer last month sold its U.S.
unit to Apollo Global Management LLC for $2.6 billion, more than
it initially expected.  Total long-term saving sales fell 6 percent to 5.81 billion
pounds from 6.18 billion pounds in the year-earlier period. Net
asset value a share fell to 273 pence at the end of the third
quarter from 281 pence at the end of June.  The company said it’s making “satisfactory progress” on
cost reduction, with operating expenses 10 percent below their
level in 2011.  The combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a percentage
of premiums, for the insurer’s property and casualty business
was little changed at 96.9 percent in the nine-month period.  Aviva has climbed 19 percent in London trading this year,
lagging the FTSE 350 Insurance Index’s 28 percent advance.
Larger competitor  Prudential Plc (PRU)  has climbed 46 percent and
Legal & General Group Plc, which yesterday reported a 20 percent
increase in net cash for the first nine months, has advanced 45
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
