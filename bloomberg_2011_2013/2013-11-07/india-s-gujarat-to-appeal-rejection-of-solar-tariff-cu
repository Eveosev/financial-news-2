Gujarat,  India ’s biggest solar power-producing state, plans to file an appeal with regulators on
their decision to reject a tariff cut for photovoltaic plants.  The Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission will hear the
appeal on Nov. 11, said Hemant Sahai, a lawyer representing
solar developers that are fighting the state’s attempts to
reduce the rate paid for power produced by their plants.  Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd., the state power purchaser,
filed a petition in May seeking to lower the tariff for solar
power by 28 percent, citing the excessive profits earned by
plant owners. The regulatory commission rejected the petition in
August, saying GUVNL cannot alter the terms of the contract
retrospectively.  GUVNL signed 88 contracts for a total of 971.5 megawatts of
solar capacity with developers, including  Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI) ,
 Adani Enterprises Ltd. (ADE) ,  Tata Power Co. (TPWR)  and Welspun Energy Ltd.,
starting 2010.  Raj Gopal, managing director at GUVNL, was unavailable when
called at his office today and didn’t respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
