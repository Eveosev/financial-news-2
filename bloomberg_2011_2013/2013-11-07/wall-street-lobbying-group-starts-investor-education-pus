Wall Street’s largest lobbying group
announced a campaign aimed at encouraging investors to better
educate themselves about their financial decisions.  The “Investor First Initiative,” seeks to strengthen the
the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association’s
relationship with individual investors by helping them to become
better informed, keep their accounts current and use appropriate
resources when investing, Sifma said today in a statement.  “A strong relationship between individual investors and
the financial industry is essential to helping investors achieve
their financial goals,” said Chief Executive Officer Judd Gregg, a former U.S. senator from New Hampshire, said in the
statement.  Sifma’s two-day annual meeting begins next week in New
York. Former President Bill Clinton, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein are
scheduled to speak.  As part of its new program, Sifma published a  document  that
its members can use to better communicate with clients. The
materials includes advice about how investors should provide
accurate information about their goals in order to receive the
best recommendations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
