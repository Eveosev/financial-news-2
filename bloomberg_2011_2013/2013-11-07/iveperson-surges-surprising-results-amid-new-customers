LivePerson Inc. (LPSN) , a maker of software
that allows businesses to track customers on their websites,
climbed 22 percent in New York after reporting a narrower-than-estimated loss amid new customers.  Shares of LivePerson jumped the most since October 2008 to
$11.12 at 1:48 p.m. in New York amid trading volume that was
four times the average of the past 90 days. LivePerson, which is
based in New York and has operations in  Israel , had the second-biggest gain in the Standard & Poor’s SmallCap 600 Index. The
Tel Aviv shares climbed 17 percent to 38.51 shekels, or $10.89.  LivePerson reported third-quarter loss of 1 cent a share,
compared with the 3-cent average estimate of nine analysts
tracked by Bloomberg. The shares sank 36 percent in New York on
May 9 as the company cut its 2013 sales forecast following the
loss of a major customer. LivePerson signed 163 deals in the
quarter and added 55 customers, the New York-based company said
in a statement yesterday.  “They’ve gone through a transition,” Mark Schappel, an
analyst at Benchmark Co., said by phone from  New York . “They
are moving from a single product line company to more of a
broader solution. There is a lot of room left in the stock if
this turnaround is for real.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
