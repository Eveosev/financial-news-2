Palm oil was little changed as
investors weighed speculation that production in  Malaysia  was
lower-than-expected last month, against concern the rally into a
 bull market  will hurt demand.  The contract for January delivery closed at 2,544 ringgit
($799) a metric ton from 2,547 yesterday on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives after swinging between gains and losses of at least
0.6 percent. Futures retreated 3.1 percent this week through
yesterday after rallying into a bull market. Palm for physical
delivery in November was at 2,560 ringgit, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Production in Malaysia, the second-biggest supplier,
probably fell in October from a month earlier, while exports
were little changed and reserves expanded to the highest level
since April, showed a Bloomberg survey published yesterday.
Output is typically highest from July to October. The Malaysian
Palm Oil Board is set to release the data on Nov. 11.  “Investors are cautious and reluctant to take any major
directional call ahead of the MPOB data,” said Isha Trivedi, an
analyst at PhillipCapital India Pvt. in Mumbai.  Production at Wilmar International Ltd., the largest  palm
oil  trader, fell 8 percent to 473,833 tons in the third quarter,
the Singapore-based company said in a statement today. Total
output of fresh fruit bunches was down 10 percent, it said.  Futures, heading for the first annual gain in three years,
advanced to 2,628 ringgit on Nov. 1, the highest close since
September 2012 and 21 percent more than the 2,167 settlement on
July 29, meeting the common definition of a bull market.  Soybean oil  for December delivery lost 0.2 percent to 41.05
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
delivery in January rose 0.3 percent to $12.585 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for May delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
close at 6,260  yuan  ($1,028) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  and soybean oil ended at 7,202 yuan from 7,206 yuan
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
