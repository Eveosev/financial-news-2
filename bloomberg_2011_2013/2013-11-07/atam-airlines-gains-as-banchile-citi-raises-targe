Latam Airlines SA (LFL) ,  Latin America ’s
largest carrier, approached a five-month high as Banchile-Citi
raised its target price, citing an expected recovery in profits.  The shares increased 0.4 percent to 8,600 pesos at 2:07
p.m. in Santiago after climbing on Nov. 5 to 8,806.50 pesos, the
highest level since June 7. The benchmark IPSA stock index
declined 0.3 percent today.  Banchile-Citi, the joint research department of Citigroup
Inc. and  Banco de Chile (CHILE) , increased its price target for Latam to
$20 per American depositary receipt from $16 and reiterated a
buy rating on expectations that cash from a planned equity
offering this quarter will help reduce financial costs and boost
profits next year.  “Most of the bad earnings news is behind us,” the
Banchile-Citi analysts, Stephen Trent, Fernan Gonzalez and
Juliano Navarro, wrote in an e-mailed research note.  They increased their profit forecast for Latam next year to
$0.98 per ADR from $0.96, according to the note. Latam approved
in June plans to sell about $1 billion in shares. Ignacio Cueto,
the chief executive officer of unit Lan Airlines SA and a member
of the controlling family, said last month that the company
plans to complete the share sale this year.  Latam’s shares in  Chile  have increased 44 percent since
reaching a four-year low in August. The ADRs fell 0.8 percent to
$16.66 today in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
