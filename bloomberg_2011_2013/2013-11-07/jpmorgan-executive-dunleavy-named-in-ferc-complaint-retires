Francis Dunleavy, the  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  energy executive who ran the Houston unit that developed
trading strategies deemed illegal by the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, has retired.  The move, ending a career spanning more than three decades,
took effect last month,  Brian Marchiony , a spokesman for the New
York-based bank, said today.  Dunleavy, as head of JPMorgan’s principal investments unit,
oversaw bidding strategies that the FERC said manipulated power
markets. JPMorgan agreed in July to pay $410 million and forgo
collecting on $262 million in disputed payments from
California’s grid operator to settle the charges.  Dunleavy was a Bear Stearns Cos. veteran, joining that firm
in 1982 and becoming one of its senior energy executives,
according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records.
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by  assets , acquired Bear Stearns
in 2008. Andrew Kittell and John Bartholomew, who both reported
to Dunleavy, still work for the bank, Marchiony said.  While the FERC didn’t sanction individuals in the case, the
 Federal Bureau  of Investigation opened a separate probe to see
if anyone committed crimes, a person briefed on the matter said
in August.  Dunleavy resigned from JPMorgan warehouse operator Henry
Bath & Son Ltd., effective Oct. 25, according to a filing
earlier this week.  William Scherman, an attorney for Dunleavy at Gibson Dunn &
Crutcher LLP in  Washington , said his client wasn’t available to
comment. Reuters reported on Dunleavy’s departure from JPMorgan
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
