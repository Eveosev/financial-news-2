Gold held gains after the biggest
advance in almost two weeks as investors await reports that may
show the  U.S. economy  lost momentum last quarter and employers
added fewer workers, boosting the case for sustained stimulus.  Bullion for immediate delivery was at $1,318.78 an ounce at
8:08 a.m. in  Singapore  from $1,317.93 yesterday, when prices
climbed 0.5 percent, the most since Oct. 24. Gold for December
delivery was little changed at $1,317.20 on the Comex.  Gold dropped 21 percent this year, set for its first annual
loss since 2000, amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  would curb
stimulus as economic growth picked up. Gross domestic product
grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter from 2.5
percent in the previous period, according to a Bloomberg survey
before the Commerce Department report today. Employers added
120,000 jobs in October from 148,000 in September, economists
predicted before data on Nov. 8.  “We believe the market will focus on upcoming economic
releases, particularly U.S. monthly non-farm payroll number and
unemployment releases,”  James Steel , an analyst at HSBC
Securities (USA) Inc., wrote in a note. “Certainly expectations
that the Fed will taper eventually are weighing on gold prices.
In the meantime, the Fed may be uncertain about how to manage”
quantitative easing, he said.  Gold fell to $1,305.98 on Nov. 5, the lowest since Oct. 17,
after the  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. non-manufacturing index rose. The central bank won’t reduce stimulus
until March, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey Oct. 17-18.  Fed Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams , who
doesn’t vote on policy this year, said Nov. 5 that economic
growth in recent months has fallen short of his expectations.
“We’re still a long ways from where we want to be,” he said.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at $21.803
an ounce after rising 0.5 percent yesterday. Platinum declined
0.2 percent to $1,462.88 an ounce. Palladium was little changed
at $763.90 an ounce after climbing to $765.04 yesterday, the
highest level since Aug. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
