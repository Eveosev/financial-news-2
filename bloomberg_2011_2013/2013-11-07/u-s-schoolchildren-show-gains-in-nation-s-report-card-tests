U.S. schoolchildren made modest gains
in math and reading on the national test known as the  Nation’s
Report Card , although less than half are performing at a level
deemed proficient.  The biennial test of fourth and eighth graders showed
greater improvement in 2013 over the two decades since it was
first administered. Forty-two percent of fourth graders were
proficient or better in math this year, compared with 13 percent
in 1990, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of
Education, which sponsors the test.  American students have been falling behind those in other
countries, with 15 year olds  ranked  14th in reading and 25th in
math among students in 34 countries tested in 2009. To improve
U.S. results, 45 states and the  District of Columbia  have
 adopted  Common Core standards, which are intended to align and
raise expectations for learning across the country. Some states
have delayed implementation because of concerns about a federal
takeover of education.  “Education drives America’s ability to lead in creativity
and innovation, skills needed in a rapidly changing world,”
William Waidelich, the executive director of the Association for
Middle Level Education, said in the statement. “These results
suggest that America’s educators and leaders are taking the
right steps by strengthening our schools.”  The Nation’s Report Card test in 2011 disappointed
educators because the results showed little improvement.  Math Gains  The 2013 version was taken by 717,000 students in public
and private schools in every U.S. state. States that showed the
biggest gains included  California , where eighth grade reading
improved seven points, and  Tennessee , where fourth grade math
results gained seven points.  Nationally, Hispanic students improved their math scores at
both grade levels, the only racial or ethnic group to do so,
while white, black, Hispanic and Asians all improved in eighth
grade reading, according to the statement.  On a zero-to-500 scale, fourth graders improved one point,
to 242, in math, and one point, to 222, in reading. Eighth
graders improved 1 point, to 285, in math and three points, to
268, in reading.  Among fourth graders, 27 percent are reading at a level
considered proficient, and 8 percent are advanced, while 34 are
doing math that is proficient and eight percent are advanced.  Thirty-two percent of eighth graders are reading at a
proficient level, with just 4 percent advanced, and 27 percent
are doing math at a proficient level, with 9 percent advanced.  “Today’s results give me hope,” said  David Driscoll ,
chairman of the National Assessment of Educational Progress,
which administers the test. “Even though the gains since 2011
are modest, some states have notable improvements, and over time
all of these improvements add up to higher achievement
overall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
