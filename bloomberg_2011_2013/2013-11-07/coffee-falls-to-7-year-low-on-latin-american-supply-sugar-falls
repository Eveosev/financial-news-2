Sugar fell to a five-week low on
speculation that  Brazil  and India, the largest growers, will
increase sales as their currencies weakened against the dollar.
Coffee and orange juice gained, while cocoa and cotton declined.  The real fell 2.2 percent against the dollar through
yesterday this month, while the rupee lost 1.5 percent. About
921,093 metric tons of sugar are waiting to be loaded for export
at ports in Brazil, up from 773,591 tons a week earlier,
Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda. said yesterday in an e-mailed
report. The commodity is headed to China,  Malaysia ,  Africa  and
other countries.  “The recent weakness in the Brazilian real and the rupee
will continue to encourage producer selling,” Jeff Dobrydney, a
vice president at Jenkins Sugar Group in Wilton,  Connecticut ,
said in a telephone interview.  Raw sugar for March delivery lost 0.3 percent to settle at
18.04 cents a pound at 1:49 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after touching 17.93 cents, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Sept. 30. The price may fall to 17 cents,
Dobrydney said, without providing a time frame.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery rebounded 2.4
percent to $1.0395 a pound, after touching $1.0095, the lowest
for a most-active contract since October 2006. Orange-juice
futures for January delivery added 0.1 percent to $1.249 a pound
on ICE.  Cocoa futures for March delivery slipped 1.8 percent to
$2,693 a ton. Cotton futures for December delivery declined 0.4
percent to 76.76 cents a pound in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
