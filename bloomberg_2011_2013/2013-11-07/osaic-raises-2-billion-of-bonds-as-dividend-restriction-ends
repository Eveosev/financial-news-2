Mosaic Co. (MOS)  issued $2 billion of bonds
in three parts as a restriction on when the largest U.S.

percent, 30-year obligations at a spread of 188 basis points,

including  capital expenditures , share buybacks or dividend
increases, the Plymouth, Minnesota-based company said today in a

of Cargill Inc. formed the company in 2004 and as part of the
merger Mosaic has been restricted from share buybacks until Nov.
