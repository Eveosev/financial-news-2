U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said he’ll confront Sri Lanka’s government over alleged  human-rights  abuses when the Commonwealth holds its summit in the
country next week.  In an article for the  Tamil Guardian newspaper , Cameron
said he’d rejected calls to boycott the summit because “the
right thing to do is engage” with the Sri Lankan government
about the allegations of abuses against the Tamil minority
during the country’s 26-year civil war.  “Four years after the conflict no one has been held to
account for grave allegations of  war crimes  and sexual violence,
journalists are routinely intimidated and thousands of people
have yet to find out what has happened to their missing
relatives,” Cameron said in the article. “I want to see that
change. And I do not believe boycotting the Commonwealth meeting
will achieve that.”  Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  will not be
attending the summit of 53 Commonwealth member states, mostly
former British colonies, over the host’s human-rights record.
The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee called on Cameron
last year to follow suit.  “This will not be an easy conversation, but diplomacy is
not about ducking the difficult discussions,” Cameron said in
the article. “It is about talking to those that you may not
agree with precisely because you want to change their
approach.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
