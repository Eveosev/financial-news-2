Gasoline fell for the fifth time in
six days as  consumer confidence  in the U.S. sank for the sixth
week in a row and jobless claims were higher than forecast.  Futures slipped as the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort  Index (COMFCOMF) 
declined to minus 37.9 in the week ended Nov. 3, the worst
reading since October 2012, from minus 37.6 the previous week.
Jobless claims  decreased  by 9,000 to 336,000 in the week ended
Nov. 2. The median forecast of 53 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a drop to 335,000.  “Products are probably feeling the sting of jobless claims
not improving,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks &
Opinions LLC in Houston. “Demand is staying flat. Nobody’s
driving because they have no jobs to go to and no money to spend
to drive somewhere else.”  Gasoline for December delivery declined 3.61 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.5119 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange

higher than the 100-day average.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 80 cents to
$11.42 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  versus Brent decreased 32
cents to $1.46.  U.S.  pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 1 cent to
$3.222 a gallon, the lowest level since Dec. 19, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA said today on its website. Prices are 24 cents
below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for December delivery fell 2.7
cents to $2.8426 a gallon. Volume was 5.5 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  over WTI fell 46 cents to $25.26 a barrel.
