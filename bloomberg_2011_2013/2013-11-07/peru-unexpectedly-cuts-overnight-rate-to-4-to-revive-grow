Peru ’s central bank unexpectedly
reduced borrowing costs for the first time in four years to
bolster the commodity-dependent economy after exports slumped.  The board, led by bank President Julio Velarde, cut the
 overnight rate  by a quarter-point to 4 percent from 4.25
percent, surprising all 15 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg who
forecast no change. Peru last cut rates in August 2009 when the
economy was in recession.  Policy makers stepped up efforts to revive growth as
falling export revenue damps investment in the third largest
copper producer. The central bank reduced  reserve requirements 
Sept. 30 for a third straight month while the government reduces
bureaucracy slowing $27 billion of investment projects.
Inflation will ease to about 2 percent next year, the mid-point
of policy makers’ target range of 1 percent to 3 percent,
Velarde said Sept. 20.  The  economy  expanded 4.3 percent in August, less than the
4.5 percent forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Growth
has lagged behind economists’ estimates in six of the last seven
months. Consumer prices rose 0.04 percent last month while
annual inflation accelerated to 3.04 percent from 2.83 percent
in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
