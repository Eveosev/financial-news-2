Kenya Airways Ltd., sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-largest airline, rose to its highest level in a
year as gains from its fuel hedging strategy will probably boost
first-half profit, according to Old Mutual.  The company’s shares, the third-worst performer in Kenya
this year,  gained  9.3 percent to 12.35 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in the capital, Nairobi, the highest level since November,
2012. About 1.46 million shares traded, or 3.5 times the three-month daily average.  “The company is in a better position compared to last year
when there was a hedging loss,” Eric Munywoki, a research
analyst at Nairobi-based Old Mutual Securities Ltd., said by
phone. “For this year we expect things to be good in terms of
hedging.”  Kenya  Airways posted a loss of 7.86 billion shillings ($92
million) in the 12 months through March, compared with a profit
of 1.66 billion shillings a year earlier, it said on June 14.  The company will announce earnings for the six months
through September on Nov. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
