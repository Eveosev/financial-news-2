Tokyo ’s office vacancy rate fell to
the lowest level in more than four years in October as demand
for space outpaced supply, said broker Miki Shoji Co.  The  rate , a measurement of unoccupied space, fell to 7.56
percent last month from 7.9 percent in September and was at its
lowest since June 2009, according to data released today by the
closely held Tokyo-based company. The 43-member Topix Real
Estate Index fell 0.4 percent at the close of trading in Tokyo.  Tokyo’s office market has been recovering since the vacancy
rate peaked in June last year amid efforts by Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe to revive the world’s third-largest economy. Average
office rents in October rose to 16,237 yen ($165) per tsubo, a
standard measure of property area in  Japan , its first increase
since June 2012, the data showed.  The Tokyo office market will improve as vacancies decline
and rents increase, albeit at a fairly gradual pace, Kayoko
Hirao, head of Japan Research at DTZ, said in a report published
Oct. 17.  A Tankan report measuring business sentiment on Oct. 1
showed that confidence among Japan’s large manufacturers at the
highest since the early stages of global credit crisis in 2007.
The  Bank of Japan  last month maintained its commitment to
unprecedented monetary easing and reiterated its forecast that
inflation will almost match its 2 percent target in the year
starting April 2015.  “The real market recovery will gather more momentum after
the commencement of the new fiscal year when companies are
expected to increase  capital investment  as a reflection of the
recent improvement in corporate performance,” DTZ’s Hirao said
in the report.  About 24,000 tsubo of space was absorbed in October,
according to the Miki Shoji report today. That is 26 percent
more than the 19,000 tsubo of space signed in September. A tsubo
is 3.3 square meters or 35.5 square feet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
