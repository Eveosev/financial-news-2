Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  will issue equity-linked bonds worth up to 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion) as it
reported quarterly profit fell 27 percent, missing analyst
estimates.  The company approved the issuance of mandatory convertible
bonds and reported third-quarter net income of 505 million
euros, according to statements issued following a board meeting
in Milan today. That compared with the 524.6 million-euro
average estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said adjusted net debt totaled 28.2 billion
euros at the end of September, and it sees cutting that to below
27 billion euros by the end of the year.  Chief Executive Officer Marco Patuano met with directors
today to discuss possible alternatives to a 2 billion-euro
capital increase. It was the board’s first meeting since Franco Bernabe stepped down last month after clashing with top
shareholder  Telefonica SA. (TEF)  Telecom Italia lost its investment-grade  rating  from Moody’s Investors Service last month and is
awaiting the results of  Standard & Poor’s  review this month.  The mandatory convertible bonds, due November 2016, will
pay a coupon of 5.75 percent to 6.5 percent, according to the
statement. They’ll be convertible into common and savings
shares. The final terms are to be announced tomorrow.  Telecom Italia revenue should be “substantially stable”
for the year compared with 2012, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
