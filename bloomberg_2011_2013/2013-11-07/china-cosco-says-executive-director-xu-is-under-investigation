China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the
nation’s largest shipping company, said Executive Director Xu Minjie is under investigation by a regulatory body that it
didn’t identify.  The probe won’t have a “material adverse effect” on the
Tianjin, northern China-based company and its operations,
according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday.  China Cosco’s board said it will assess the investigation
from time to time and advise shareholders of any material
developments. The company said it was told about the probe by
parent China Ocean Shipping Group Co.  Xu, 54 at the time of China Cosco’s annual report in April,
is also an executive vice president of China Ocean Shipping,
vice chairman of  China International Marine Containers Group Co. (2039) 
and chairman of Cosco Logistics Co., according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. He’s a graduate of the Qingdao Ocean Shipping
Mariners College and holds business degrees from Shanghai
Maritime University and Maastricht School of Management.  Xu didn’t immediately reply to a voice mail left at his
office number outside of normal business hours today.  China Cosco said last month that third-quarter net loss
narrowed to 1.04 billion  yuan  ($171 million) from 1.53 billion
yuan a year earlier. The company said in August that it was
selling stakes in two real estate units to its parent for 3.73
billion yuan to avoid a third straight annual loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
