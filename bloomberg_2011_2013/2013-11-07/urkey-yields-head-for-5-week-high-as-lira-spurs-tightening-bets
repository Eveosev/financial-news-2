Turkey ’s benchmark  bond yields  headed
for their highest level in five weeks as a weaker currency
fueled speculation the central bank will raise borrowing costs
for the nation’s lenders.  Yields on two-year notes rose 19 basis points, or 0.19
percentage point, to 8.42 percent at 12:01 p.m. in Istanbul, the
highest since Sept. 30 on a closing basis. The lira depreciated
to its lowest level in a month yesterday and traded 0.2 percent
stronger at 2.0323 per dollar today.  The central bank declared Nov. 11 and Nov. 12 as extra-tightening days during which it does not provide daily liquidity
at its lowest funding rate of 4.5 percent, implying a hawkish
monetary stance. The move will increase the average funding rate
to 6.50 percent if it is repeated every week in November, Erkin Isik, a strategist at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  in Istanbul, wrote
in e-mailed comments. Normally, the bank refrains from lending
at the minimum rate to just once a week.  “The risk of further tightening from the central bank is
priced,” Isik wrote. “The short-term bond yields and exchange
rates are moving very much in tandem.”  The 30-day moving average for the commercial banks’  cost of
funding  is 6.30 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
