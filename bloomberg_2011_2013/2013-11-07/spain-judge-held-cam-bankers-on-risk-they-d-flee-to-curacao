A Spanish judge investigating the
management of failed savings bank Caja de Ahorros del
Mediterraneo ordered its former managing director to be held in
custody because of the risk he’d flee to the Caribbean.  Judge Javier Gomez Bermudez ordered the detention of
Roberto Lopez Abad to avoid destruction of evidence and because
he and two other former CAM executives had the financial means
to flee to Curacao, which has no extradition treaty with Spain,
according to a ruling dated yesterday sent by e-mail from the
National Court in  Madrid  today.  The Bank of Spain took over CAM and removed its management
in July 2011 as losses linked to real estate loans wrecked its
business. Banco Sabadell SA then agreed the same year to buy the
lender for one euro. Judge Gomez Bermudez today was due to take
declarations from Lopez Abad and the other former executives as
he probes their links to CAM’s alleged investments in tax
havens.  There were no listings for Lopez Abad in the Valencia
region, according to the online phone directory
www.blancasamarillas.es.  To contact the reporter on this story:
