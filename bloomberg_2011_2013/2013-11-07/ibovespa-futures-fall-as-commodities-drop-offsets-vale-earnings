Ibovespa  futures  declined as lower
commodities prices dimmed the outlook for  Brazil ’s exports,
overshadowing earnings from iron-ore producer  Vale SA (VALE5)  that
exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Fuels and petrochemicals group Ultrapar Participacoes SA
may be active after also posting earnings that topped forecasts.
Bus maker  Marcopolo SA (POMO4)  may move after Deutsche Bank AG raised
its recommendation on the stock to hold from sell.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December dropped 0.4
percent to 53,300 at 9:27 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real was little

of 24 raw materials declined 0.1 percent.  Vale, the heaviest-weighted  stock  on the Ibovespa, posted
third-quarter net income of $3.5 billion, or 68 cents a share,
higher than the average forecast of 60 cents among eight
analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.  Brazil’s main equity index entered a bull market Sept. 9
after rising 20 percent from this year’s low on July 3 through
