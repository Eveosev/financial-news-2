American Water (AWK)  Works Co., the largest
publicly traded water company in the U.S., said profit declined
2 percent in the third quarter as below-normal temperatures
lowered customer usage.  Net income was $150.7 million compared with $153.8 million
in the year-earlier quarter, the Voorhees, New Jersey-based
utility said in a statement. Operating revenue was almost
unchanged at $829.2 million as weather caused a drop in demand.
Usage rises in hotter, drier weather.  American Water narrowed its guidance for 2013 adjusted
earnings per share to $2.17 to $2.22 excluding one-time charges
related to a completed tender offer compared with an EPS range
of $2.15 to $2.25 in August, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sterba
said yesterday in the statement.  Third-quarter EPS was 84 cents versus an 85-cent consensus
from 13 analystsâ€™ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company
provides drinking water and wastewater services to 14 million
people in 30 states and parts of  Canada . It has completed the
purchase of eight water and four wastewater systems in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
