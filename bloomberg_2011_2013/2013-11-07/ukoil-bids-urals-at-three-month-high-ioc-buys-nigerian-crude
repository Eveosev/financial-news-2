Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought North
Sea Forties and Oseberg crude grades. OAO Lukoil failed to buy
Russian Urals in the Mediterranean at the highest level for more
than three months.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, bought five
million barrels of Nigerian crude in its first tender for
January loading fuel, said four traders who participate in the
market, asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  North Sea  Shell bought Forties cargo F1120 for loading Nov. 28 to
Nov. 30 from  BP Plc (BP/)  at 9 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed. The grade was last sold on Nov. 4 at a
discount of 24 cents for loading on Nov. 17 to Nov. 19.  Shell also bought Oseberg cargo 20131102 for Nov. 19 to
Nov. 21 from Vitol Group at a premium of 75 cents to Dated
Brent, 5 cents less than yesterday, the survey showed.  BP failed to sell Ekofisk for Nov. 21 to Nov. 23 at 80
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, or a premium of $1.05 for
Nov. 25 to Nov. 27, according to the survey.  Brent for December settlement traded at $103.75 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $106.11 in the previous session. The January
contract was at $103.93, a premium of 18 cents to December.  Repair works at the  North Sea  Claymore and Piper platforms
will be extended, according to Talisman Sinopec Energy U.K.
Ltd., the operator.  Production at Claymore was shut in the last week of August
in preparation for a new compressor to be lifted onto the
platform on Aug. 30, Gavin Roberts, a company spokesman, said by
e-mail.  The halt was extended because of corrosion issues and
production is expected to resume in the first quarter of next
year, Talisman said yesterday in its results for the third
quarter.  The Piper platform shut in October for planned maintenance
and an issue was identified with the flare tip, which is being
replaced, Roberts said.  North Sea oil producers will ship 2.3 percent less of the
region’s 12 main crudes next month, loading programs obtained by
Bloomberg show.  Cargoes of Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk, Statfjord,
Gullfaks, Alvheim, Aasgard, DUC, Flotta, Grane and Troll blends
will total almost 63.2 million barrels. That’s equal to about
2.037 million barrels a day and compares with a revised 2.085
million a day of loadings this month.  Urals/Mediterranean  Lukoil didn’t manage to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals for
Nov. 17 to Nov. 21 loading at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the survey showed.
That’s the highest bid since July 24 and compares with a
discount of 30 cents yesterday for loading on Nov. 15 to Nov.
19.  Three free slots for Urals for November loading from Baltic
Sea ports were filled, said four traders who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  OAO Rosneft filled two free slots at Ust-Luga for loading
on Nov. 23 to Nov. 24, Nov. 27 to Nov. 28, they said. An extra
cargo for Nov. 24 to Nov. 25 from Primorsk, also owned by
Rosneft, was added to the loading program.  Rosneft put the three cargoes in a tender which closes at 3
p.m. Moscow time on Nov. 8, with offers valid until Nov. 11,
said two traders who received the document.  OAO Surgutneftegas filled the position for Nov. 26 to Nov.
27 from Primorsk. The cargo was sold to Talmay Trading via a
tender, said three traders involved in the region’s oil market.  China  International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., known
as Unipec, booked the Suexmaz Seatriumph to load Urals crude
from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  on Nov. 29 to Ningbo, China,
at a cost of $3.1 million, according to two tanker reports,
including Athens-based Optima Shipbrokers. A Suezmax tanker
typically holds 1 million barrels of crude. Lv Dapeng, a
Beijing-based spokesman for China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.,
parent of Unipec, didn’t reply to two calls to his office.  Libya ’s Mellitah port resumed loading after contacts with
Amazigh community representatives and local officials, according
to the website of state-owned National Oil Corp., citing Deputy
Oil Minister Omar Shakmak.  West Africa  BP failed to sell 600,000 barrels of Nigerian Qua Iboe at
$4.05 a barrel more than Dated Brent for Nov. 12 to Dec. 12
delivery to Rotterdam, or a premium of $3.90 for delivery to
Lavera,  France , during the same period, the survey showed.
Offers were 15 cents less than yesterday.  Indian Oil bought Bonny Light and Bonga crudes from Shell,
Qua Iboe and EA from Total SA, and Escravos from  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
the four traders said. Each grade is of 1 million barrels.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, is
seeking to buy 950,000 barrels of crude in tender for Jan. 7 to
Jan. 9, or Jan. 12 to Jan. 14 delivery to Cilacap refinery, or
Jan. 9 to Jan. 14 to Balikpapan plant, according to a document
obtained by  Bloomberg News . The tender closes at 3 p.m.
Singapore time on Nov. 11, with offers valid until 6 p.m. Nov.
