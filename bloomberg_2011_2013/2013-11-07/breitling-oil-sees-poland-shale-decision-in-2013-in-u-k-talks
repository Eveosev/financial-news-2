Breitling Oil & Gas Corp., seeking
shale investment in  Poland , expects Marathon Petroleum Corp. to
decide this year on its planned sale of assets in the country.  Breitling, which plans to list in New York, then Hong Kong
or  London , is among companies interested in acquiring the assets
and is also in talks with a British company on investing in the
U.K., Chief Executive Officer Chris Faulkner said yesterday in
an interview, declining to name the party.  “The U.K. is on the right track,” he said in London.
“We’d be fools not to exploit this.” Breitling would bid with
a partner if it enters the next licensing round, Faulkner said.  The U.K. is luring drillers with lower taxes as it seeks to
cut reliance on imports amid falling reserves from the North
Sea. The Bowland shale in northern  England  may hold as much as
1,300 trillion cubic feet of gas, enough to meet demand for
about 50 years, according to a government report in June.  Companies with U.K. shale acreage include Cuadrilla
Resources Ltd., IGas Energy Plc, Celtique Energie Ltd., Dart
Energy Ltd., Egdon Resources Plc, Aurora Petroleum Ltd. and
Reach Coal Seam Gas Ltd.  In Poland, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Talisman Energy Inc. have
been exiting after disappointing results. Potentially tighter
European Union regulation on environmental-impact assessments
may be a deterrent to investment, Faulkner said.  The CEO plans to list Irving, Texas-based Breitling in New
York in the “near-term,” declining to estimate how much may be
raised. It has operations in  Texas , North Dakota and  Oklahoma .  To contact the reporter on this story:
