Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL) , the
world’s largest palm oil trader, reported a 2.5 percent increase
in third-quarter profit as volumes from its sugar and consumer-product business gained.  Net income  was $416 million in the three months ended Sept.
30, compared with $405.8 million a year earlier, the Singapore-based company said today in a statement. Sales declined 4.2
percent to $11.8 billion.  Wilmar, with its shares heading for the first annual gain
in four years, said in August cheaper costs for commodities
would benefit the company even as lower palm oil prices add to
challenges. Sales volume at its sugar business jumped 44 percent
in the quarter, while from its consumer-product unit gained 14
percent on stronger demand for edible oils and flour.  “Our investments in recent years in capacity expansion,
new businesses and downstream products have enabled Wilmar to
realize volume growth and to maintain margins amidst low crude
palm oil prices,” Chief Executive Officer Kuok Khoon Hong said
in the statement today.  The  stock  increased 0.9 percent to S$3.45 today at the
close in  Singapore , before the announcement. Wilmar has gained
3.3 percent this year, rebounding after three straight year’s of
declines.  Profit excluding non-operating items in the quarter was
$390.9 million. That compares with the $354.8 million average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Today’s
results include a $24 million gain from selling a stake in
Fortune Gas Investment Holdings Ltd., Wilmar said.  Sugar Sales  Pretax profit at Wilmar’s sugar unit rose 49 percent to
$151.2 million, it said today. The company sold 3.4 million
metric tons of sugar in the quarter as favorable weather in
 Australia  allowed it to crush more cane.  Earnings before tax at its consumer-product division
climbed 20 percent to $58.3 million, while its palm and laurics
unit posted a 17 percent gain in pretax profit to $211.9
million.  Pretax net at its plantations’ unit fell 50 percent to
$57.9 million and palm fruit production declined 10 percent in
the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
