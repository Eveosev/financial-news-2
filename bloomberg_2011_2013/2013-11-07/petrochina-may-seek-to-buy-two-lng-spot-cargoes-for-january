PetroChina Co.,  China ’s biggest oil
and gas producer, may seek to buy as many as two spot cargoes of
liquefied natural gas for January delivery, according to a
company official.  The shipments will help to meet peak power demand in the
winter, said the official, who asked not to be identified
because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media. PetroChina
may buy more spot LNG in February and March depending on heating
needs in China, he said.  The Beijing-based company purchased some cargoes last month
for delivery by December to cope with the country’s cold winter,
completing its imports for the year, according to the official.
He declined to provide details of volumes and prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
