Warburg Pincus LLC said Scott Arenare, who joined the private-equity firm as general counsel
in 1998, is leaving for a new business opportunity.  Robert Knauss, previously a partner at Munger Tolles &
Olson LLP in Los Angeles, will replace Arenare and oversee the
firm’s legal and regulatory matters, according to a statement
today from New York-based Warburg Pincus, which didn’t give
details on Arenare’s new job. Arenare was a member of Warburg
Pincus’s executive-management group, focusing on legal,
regulatory and compliance matters, according to a biography on
the firm’s website.  Arenare’s tenure “spanned both the strong growth of our
firm globally and an era of great change in the private-equity
business,” Chip Kaye, Warburg Pincus’s co-chief executive
officer, said in the statement.  Warburg Pincus, founded in 1966, oversees about $35 billion
in assets and owns stakes in more than 125 companies. Kewsong Lee, a veteran deal maker who had been at Warburg for 21 years,
was hired earlier this week as deputy chief investment officer
at  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , where he will report to co-founder Bill Conway.  To contact the reporter on this story:
