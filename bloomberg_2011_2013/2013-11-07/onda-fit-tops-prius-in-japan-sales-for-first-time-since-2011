Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Fit compact outsold
Toyota Motor Corp.’s Prius and Aqua hybrids in  Japan  last month
to become the nation’s best-selling model for the first time in
more than two years.  Deliveries of the Fit more than doubled from a year earlier
to 23,281 units last month, according to data released today by
the Japan Automobile Dealers Association. That compared with
20,886 for the Prius and 19,984 for the Aqua, the figures show.  Honda recaptured the top monthly sales spot after
introducing a new version of its Fit compact in September, which
the Tokyo-based automaker said gives better mileage and costs
less than the Toyota Aqua, a smaller take on the Prius that’s
known as the Prius c in the U.S. In the first four weeks, sales
and advance orders for the Fit reached four times the
automaker’s forecast.  The last time Honda’s small car topped Japan’s monthly
charts was in May 2011, before the Aqua was introduced, JADA
data show. The two  Toyota (7203)  gasoline-electric models have
alternated as the top-selling car in Japan since then until last
month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
