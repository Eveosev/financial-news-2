Repsol SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil
producer, reported a larger-than-expected drop in third-quarter
profit as production in Libya was disrupted and refining margins
narrowed.  Adjusted net income fell to 354 million euros ($479
million) from 671 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based
company said today in a  statement . That fell short of the 390
million-euro average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The company’s businesses have performed well despite the
negative effect of economic weakness in Europe on refining
margins and the temporary production shutdowns in Libya,” it
said in the statement. “In this context, Repsol has continued
to add production and resources and increasing its exploratory
acreage.”  Production was 344,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in
the third quarter, similar to a year ago and down from 359,000
barrels in the second quarter. Refining margins shrank to $2.60
a barrel from $6.40 a barrel a year earlier.  Repsol is trying to bolster output with new projects after
Argentina seized its YPF SA unit, one of its largest assets,
last year. Repsol shares have recovered 29 percent this year,
though they remain 17 percent lower than they were at the end of
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
