The Atlantic Club Casino’s owner
filed for  bankruptcy court  protection, saying it will consider
reorganizing or selling its assets, which include an 801-room
hotel in Atlantic City,  New Jersey .  RIH Acquisitions NJ LLC, which owns and operates the
Atlantic Club Casino Hotel, listed as much as $50 million in
debts and assets in a Chapter 11 filing in in Camden, New
Jersey, yesterday. The hotel, formerly known as the Atlantic
City Hilton and ACH, has seven restaurants, an event space that
can accommodate 1,600 people, and more than 75,000 square feet
of gaming space including slots and table games.  The closely held company said in court papers that it seeks
to honor casino chips and manage its cash in order to keep
operating. RIH Acquisitions said it intends to preserve its
“going-concern value” while it pursues its options including
an auction of its assets in bankruptcy.  Affiliate RIH Propco listed as much as $50,000 in assets
and debt in its own bankruptcy filing today.  Casinos in  Atlantic City  have struggled with a weak economy
and competition from new gambling venues in nearby Philadelphia.  Atlantic City-based Revel AC Inc. filed bankruptcy in
March, listing $1.1 billion in assets and $1.5 billion in debt,
less than a year after opening the city’s first new casino since
2003. The company emerged from bankruptcy in May under a deal
with creditors that cut debt and gave them ownership of the
resort.  The case is In re RIH Acquisitions NJ LLC; 13-bk-34483;
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of New Jersey (Camden).  To contact the reporter on this story:
