Tony McCoy  today became the first
jockey to ride 4,000 winners over jumps in Britain and Ireland
when he added the one victory he needed.  He came fifth on Church Field in his first race today
before clinching a narrow win on 6-4 favorite Mountain Tunes in
a novice hurdle at Towcester in central  England , overtaking Kris
Spin in the closing strides.  Both McCoy’s mounts today are trained by Jonjo O’Neill and
owned by J.P. McManus.  “What a relief,” McCoy said in a televised interview as
fellow jockeys showered him with champagne. “It’s amazing, the
racing people are fantastic. It couldn’t have gone any better.
I’m so pleased I did it for Jonjo and J.P. because they’ve been
so good to me.”  McCoy rode his first winner 21 years ago at Thurles in the
Republic of Ireland.  The 39-year-old Northern Irishman, widely known by his
initials A.P., has been Britain’s champion jockey over fences
and hurdles for the past 18 seasons, a record tally.  His major race victories have included the Champion Hurdle
and Gold Cup at Cheltenham, and the Grand National at Aintree.  “Full marks to him, he’s a credit to the game,” McManus
said. “I’m so proud and pleased that I know him and his family.
Long may he carry on.”  McCoy’s total of winners is more than 1,400 ahead of his
nearest rival, Richard Johnson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
