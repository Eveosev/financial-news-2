Michael Sherwood , co-head of  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s European business, will oversee operations in
emerging markets as he takes over for J. Michael Evans, who’s
retiring.  Sherwood, a London-based vice chairman, will coordinate the
company’s units in so-called growth markets, Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn said today
in a memo to employees.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for the New
York-based bank, confirmed the memo’s contents.  Sherwood, 48, “will help drive our strategy, identify new
commercial opportunities and allocate resources in countries
experiencing stronger economic growth and rapid business and
capital markets development,” Blankfein and Cohn wrote in the
memo. “Michael will also oversee the performance of our
businesses, including their footprint and pace of growth.”  Sherwood, a Briton, joined Goldman Sachs in 1986 and became
a partner in 1994, according to the memo. He was promoted to
vice chairman in February 2008, at the same time as Evans, and
kept his role as co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International.  Sherwood rose through the ranks of the fixed-income
department like Blankfein, 59, and Cohn, 53. He was co-head of
the trading business from 2003 to 2008. He’s currently chairman
of the partnership committee.  The Wall Street Journal reported the move earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
