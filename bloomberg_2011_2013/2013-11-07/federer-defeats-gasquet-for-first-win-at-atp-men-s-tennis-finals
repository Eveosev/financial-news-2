Six-time champion  Roger Federer 
defeated France’s  Richard Gasquet  in straight sets to keep open
the possibility of making the semifinals of the ATP World Tour
Finals.  The 32-year-old Swiss player won 6-4, 6-3. He’s beaten the
27-year-old Gasquet 11 of the 13 times they’ve played.  The record 17-time tennis Grand Slam winner lost to second-ranked Novak Djokovic earlier this week in their opening group B
match at the year-ending tennis tournament at the O2 Arena in
London. Djokovic plays Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina in a
match this evening. Del Potro beat Gasquet in their first match
at the event.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
