Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , which had
the steepest drop in trading revenue among Wall Street’s largest
banks, posted losses from that business on 15 days during the
third quarter, the most since 2011.  Traders made more than $100 million on four days in the
three months ended Sept. 30, down from seven days in the year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a regulatory
filing today. None of the losses were more than $50 million and
none topped the bank’s so-called value-at-risk, an estimate of
potential trading losses.  Goldman Sachs generated $2.86 billion from its trading
division in the third quarter, a 32 percent decrease from the
year-earlier period. Client activity fell and the firm struggled
to manage inventory amid speculation about whether the  Federal
Reserve  would ease its economic stimulus.  “Concerns about the global economic outlook created a more
difficult operating environment for our clients in the third
quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a
conference call last month. “These challenges were amplified by
the seasonal slowdown traditionally impacting client activity in
July and August.”  The firm’s inventory fell to $244.3 billion, a 25 percent
drop from a year earlier and a 12 percent decline from the end
of the second quarter. The was the biggest decline and the
lowest absolute amount since the bank started disclosing the
figure at the end of 2010.  The number of days with losses was the highest since the
firm had 17 such days in the fourth quarter of 2011. The four
days of gains of more than $100 million were the fewest since
the second quarter of 2012. Goldman Sachs hasn’t had fewer than
four such days in a quarter since 2005.  Bank of America Corp.  posted daily losses twice during the
quarter, including a $21 million misstep. Morgan Stanley posted
losses on seven days, including two that topped $25 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
