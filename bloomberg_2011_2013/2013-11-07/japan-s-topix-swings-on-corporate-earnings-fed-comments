Japan’s  Topix index  fell, paring
yesterday’s gain, as earnings forecasts disappointed investors
ahead of U.S. growth and jobs data that may provide clues as to
when the  Federal Reserve  will start cutting stimulus.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest car manufacturer,
lost 1.3 percent after its net-income forecast missed estimates.
Casio Computer Co., which makes watches and calculators,
declined 2.9 percent after raising its profit outlook less than
analysts expected. Toray Industries Inc., the producer of carbon
fiber used in Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner, jumped 5.7 percent
after profit surged.  The Topix slid 0.6 percent to 1,184.73 at the close in
Tokyo after rising 0.8 percent yesterday. All but four of the 33
industry groups fell, with volume 11 percent below the 30-day
average. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.8 percent to
14,228.44. The U.S. releases gross domestic product data today
and employment figures tomorrow.  “The market is simply falling without any catalysts after
gaining yesterday,” said Kenji Ueno, a senior investment
manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co. “The
market has traded in a tight range recently and it’s hard for it
to make a big move. Individual stocks are moving a lot due to
earnings while the market is directionless as a whole.”  The  Topix (TPX)  trailed 23 other developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg in October, rising less than 0.1 percent. The measure
remains the best performer this year in the group with a 38
percent rally. Shares rose as unprecedented monetary easing by
the  Bank of Japan  weakened the yen, improving the earnings
outlook for exporters.  Earnings Season  Earnings season continues in Japan with more than 300
companies reporting today and tomorrow. Profit per share on the
gauge is expected to  increase  46 percent from the previous
quarter, according to analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Toyota fell 1.3 percent to 6,270 yen after saying yesterday
net income will probably rise to 1.67 trillion yen ($17 billion)
this fiscal year, 13 percent higher than its previous forecast.
The average of 22 analyst estimates was 1.82 trillion yen.  Casio lost 2.9 percent to 925 yen after forecasting annual
net income of 13.5 billion yen, while analysts expected a 14.8
billion yen gain.  Toray jumped 5.7 percent to 647 yen, the biggest rally
since April, after saying second-quarter profit rose 62 percent
as demand for carbon fiber grew. Net income climbed to 16.1
billion yen in the three months ended Sept. 30 from 9.9 billion
yen a year ago, the company said in a statement today. Sales
advanced 16 percent to 451 billion yen.  New Index  Japan  Exchange Group Inc., the main bourse operator in the
world’s second-biggest equity market, and Nikkei Inc. will
create an index that selects members based on return on equity
in a bid to highlight the nation’s best stocks. The measure, set
to start on Jan. 6, will have 400 shares, with 386 Tokyo Stock
Exchange first section companies, one from the second section,
two from the TSE Mothers market and 11 from Jasdaq, the company
said in a statement yesterday.  Companies not included in the Topix that were selected for
the new index gained. CyberAgent Inc., an  Internet company 
listed on the TSE Mothers Index, rose 1.9 percent to 3,415 yen.
GungHo Online Entertainment, a maker of online games that trades
in the Jasdaq market,  added  2.5 percent to 57,900 yen, snapping
a six-day loss.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. The equity measure climbed 0.4 percent and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  closed at a record high yesterday after two
separate papers by members of the Federal Reserve board argued
the need to maintain loose monetary policy to support growth in
the world’s biggest economy.  Fed Outlook  William English , head of the Division of Monetary Affairs,
supported the central bank’s strategy of maintaining low
 interest rates  while unemployment is above 6.5 percent and wrote
that an even lower threshold may be helpful. Another paper by
David Wilcox said the weakness of the  U.S. economy  calls for a
“highly accommodative monetary policy.”  Data today may show U.S. GDP grew at a 2 percent annualized
rate after a 2.5 percent pace in the second quarter, according
to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Payrolls probably rose by 120,000 workers last month after a
148,000 gain in September, while the jobless rate climbed to 7.3
percent, Labor Department figures are expected to show tomorrow.  The Topix  traded  at 1.22 times book value today, compared
to 2.56 for the S&P 500 and 1.81 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
yesterday. The Topix’s 30-day historic volatility was at 16.61
today, down from its five-year median of 19.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
