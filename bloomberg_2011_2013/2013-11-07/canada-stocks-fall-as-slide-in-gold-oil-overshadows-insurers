Canadian  stocks  fell, leaving the
benchmark index at a two-week low, as commodity stocks slumped
on falling oil and gold prices after the  European Central Bank 
unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate.  Dundee Precious Metals Inc. lost 5.8 percent as gold slid
to a three-week low. Penn West Petroleum Ltd. tumbled 8.5
percent for a second day of losses after saying yesterday its
turnaround will extend into 2014.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  rose
2.7 percent as profit advanced on rising wealth and insurance
product sales. Sun Life Financial Inc. gained 2.4 percent as the
insurer’s profit topped estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  lost 86.21
points, or 0.6 percent, to 13,294.20 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
lowest since Oct. 23. The benchmark Canadian equity gauge has
advanced 6.9 percent this year, the third-worst performer in the
world among developed markets, ahead of  Hong Kong  and  Singapore .  “Oil has continued to sell off and Draghi cutting  interest
rates  to stimulate the economy has caught the markets by
surprise,” said Philip Petursson, director of institutional
equities with Manulife Asset Management Ltd., in a phone
interview from Toronto. His firm manages about C$248 billion
($237 billion). “The decline in gold has to do with the ECB,
we’ll see a downward trend for gold as the  U.S. dollar  rises
against the euro.”  Commodity prices dropped as the dollar spiked against the
euro after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  cut the
region’s benchmark interest rate to a record low. The
greenback’s gain put pressure on dollar-denominated products
such as oil.  Better-than-expected U.S. growth in the third-quarter
fueled speculation the  Federal Reserve  would cut monetary
stimulus sooner than anticipated, damping demand for gold.  Materials Stocks  Nine of 10  industries  in the S&P/TSX retreated. Trading
volume was 7.7 percent higher than the 30-day average at this
time of day.  Materials producers dropped 1.9 percent. Dundee Precious
Metals slumped 5.8 percent to C$4.10 and Torex Gold Resources
Inc. sank 11 percent to 92 Canadian cents, the lowest in four
years, as the price of gold dropped to a three-week low.  Energy stocks lost 1.1 percent as a group. Bellatrix
Exploration Ltd. dropped 7.1 percent to C$7.32 and Suncor Energy
Inc. retreated 1.6 percent to C$36.09 as crude declined.  Penn West Petroleum tumbled 8.5 percent to C$8.91,
extending a two-day loss to 23 percent. The Calgary-based
company yesterday slumped the most since 2008 after saying it
will target as much as C$2 billion in asset sales. Penn West has
cut more than 25 percent of its workforce this year.  Insurer Results  Manulife Financial,  Canada ’s largest life insurer by market
value, rose 2.7 percent to C$19.22, for the highest close in
three years. The company posted third-quarter adjusted profit of
36 cents a share, topping the 35-cent average estimate of 12
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sun Life Financial gained 2.4 percent to C$36.27, the
highest level for the stock since August 2009. The insurer
yesterday reported said profit beat estimates as revenue from
wealth-management and insurance sales increased. Company
executives said on a conference call today that expenses will be
lower next year.  TMX Group Ltd. (X) , the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange,
rallied 2.3 percent to C$48.12, the biggest gain since August.  The Toronto-based company reported adjusted third-quarter
 earnings  of 75 Canadian cents a share, ahead of the 74-cent
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  TMX’s operating expenses fell 7 percent compared with the
second quarter, and the company is now on track to achieve C$28
million in annualized savings, ahead of previous projections for
C$20 million, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
