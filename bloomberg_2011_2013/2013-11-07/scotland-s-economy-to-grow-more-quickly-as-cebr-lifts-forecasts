The Scottish economy will expand at a
faster rate this year and next, according to the Centre for
Economics and Business Research.  Gross domestic product will increase by 1.4 percent in
2013, compared with an earlier forecast of 0.8 percent, the CEBR
said today. In 2014, GDP will increase by 2.2 percent compared
with its July forecast of 1.3 percent. The pace of growth next
year will be the quickest since 2007, it said.  Between 2015 and 2018, the Scottish economy will grow an
average 1.6 percent a year compared with a previous prediction
of 1.4 percent, the CEBR said. The pick-up in growth is because
of the business services industry, it said.  The revised forecasts echo a report by the  Fraser of
Allander Institute  at Strathclyde University last week. It said
the economy would expand more quickly than it thought in June,
though warned about the durability of the recovery because it
was driven by households borrowing to spend more.  To contact the reporter on this story:
