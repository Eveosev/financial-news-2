Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) ’s credit
rating outlook was raised by Moody’s Investors Service after
 Japan ’s stock-market rally and cost cuts spurred a profit
recovery at the country’s second-biggest brokerage.  The outlook on Daiwa’s Baa3 long-term  rating  was changed to
stable from negative, Moody’s said in a statement today, two
years after downgrading the Tokyo-based firm to the lowest
investment grade as losses mounted abroad.  “Daiwa has benefited from a sharp recovery in earnings due
to major changes in the environment and sentiment for the
domestic market,” Moody’s said in the statement. “Daiwa’s
success in reducing operating expenses and downsizing its
overseas operations are additional, and equally important,
factors for the recovery.”  Profits at Daiwa and bigger competitor  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) 
soared in the six months ended September as Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe’s economic-stimulus program bolstered investors’
appetite for local stocks. Both companies have been cutting
costs that swelled as they pursued expansions overseas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
