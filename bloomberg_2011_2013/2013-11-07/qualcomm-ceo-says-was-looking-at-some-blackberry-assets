Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , the world’s largest
maker of chips used in mobile phones, looked at some of the
assets of  BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY)  before the struggling smartphone maker
unveiled a turnaround plan after a takeover deal collapsed.  “There were some assets that we were interested in and we
were looking at, but obviously they got a new refinancing,”
Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs said in a telephone
interview today. When asked whether Qualcomm would contribute to
attempts to turn around BlackBerry, he said, “they have their
own strategy. We’re waiting to hear where they are headed.”  BlackBerry ended a review of its strategic options earlier
this week after a $4.7 billion buyout deal with  Fairfax
Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH)  was canceled. The smartphone maker is
now raising $1 billion in convertible debt and will pursue a
fresh turnaround plan under new interim CEO John Chen.  Cerberus Capital Management LP had teamed up with
BlackBerry co-founder Mike Lazaridis to explore a bid for the
company before the new plan was announced, and was in talks with
Qualcomm about having the chipmaker join the coalition, two
people familiar with the talks had said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
