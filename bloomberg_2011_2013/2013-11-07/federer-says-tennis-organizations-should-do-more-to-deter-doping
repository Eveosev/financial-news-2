Record 17-time tennis Grand Slam
champion  Roger Federer  said the sport needs to do more drug
tests to deter cheating.  “We’re not getting maybe tested enough,” the Swiss player
said at a news conference in London. “I think I was tested 25
times in 2003-2004. It’s been clearly going down this season.”  Federer, a former top-ranked player now No. 7, was speaking
after a 6-4, 6-3 victory over  Richard Gasquet  of France in the
season-ending ATP World Tour Finals. He has called before for
more stringent anti-doping measures, as has Wimbledon champion
Andy Murray.  Viktor Troicki  of Serbia was given a 12-month suspension
for missing a blood test and Marin Cilic of Croatia completed a
four-month ban last month after testing positive for the
stimulant nikethamide.  In 2009, Gasquet was cleared of doping by the Court of
Arbitration for Sport, which said he tested positive for cocaine
because he kissed a woman who’d ingested the drug.  Federer said that he wasn’t tested for drugs during a
February-March 2012 run of three straight tournament titles in
Rotterdam, Dubai and Indian Wells.  “For me, that’s not OK,” he said. “You just show up and
test a guy that’s winning everything. That’s sometimes what I
struggle with.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
