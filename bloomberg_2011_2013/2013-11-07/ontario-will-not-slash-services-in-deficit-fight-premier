Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne said
the province won’t miss deficit-reduction targets as it invests
in infrastructure and services.  “It’s not that we’re saying that we are abandoning that,”
Wynne said today at a media conference broadcast on CP24
television. “We are very aware that continuing to keep spending
under control is critical. We need to work with our ministers to
regulate the budget.”  Canada’s biggest province forecasts its budget deficit will
swell to C$11.7 billion ($11.2 billion) this fiscal year from
C$9.8 billion last year. Ontario has pledged to eliminate that
shortfall by the fiscal year starting April 2017.  The province is prepared to miss its targets to avoid deep
program cuts, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported today.  “Cutting programs, slashing across the board is not going
to get us to an aspirational future,” Wynne said. “It’s just
not going to work.”  Finance Minister Charles Sousa is due to give an update on
the province’s finances at about 1:30 p.m. today. The statement
will emphasize spending, particularly on infrastructure, to
increase economic growth, the Globe said.  Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, a former Ontario
finance minister, urged the province to stay on track.  “What I don’t want to hear from the government of Ontario
is that they’re abandoning their plan,” Flaherty told reporters
in Toronto today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
