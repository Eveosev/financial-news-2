Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the No. 2
U.S. life insurer, posted the biggest gain in the 81-company
Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index after reporting its first
profit in five quarters.  The insurer jumped 4 percent to $85.08 at 12:40 p.m. in New
York. Shares advanced 60 percent this year, more than twice the
gain of the  S&P 500 Index .  Prudential’s third-quarter results swung to net income of
$1.04 billion from a $584 million loss a year earlier, the
 Newark , New Jersey-based company said late yesterday in a
statement. Operating profit, which excludes some investments and
the results of policies sold before the firm went public, was
$2.94 a share, beating the $2.11 average estimate of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Results included “solid asset-management earnings, good
international margins, even after one-time adjustments, and
favorable expense control,”  Randy Binner , an analyst with FBR
Capital Markets, said in a note to investors.  Per-share adjusted operating earnings are projected to be
$8.75 to $9.25 per share next year, Prudential said today in a
regulatory filing. That compares with an  average estimate  of
$9.11 in a Bloomberg survey of 21 analysts.  Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld benefited from
results at an insurer he acquired from Hartford Financial
Services Group Inc. and returns on assets he added in pension
deals with General Motors Co. and Verizon Communications Inc.  “Prudential has never performed better,” Strangfeld said
on a conference call with analysts today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
