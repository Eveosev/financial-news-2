For sale: $2.495 million In Los Angeles, real estate often stays in the celebrity family. If one celeb lives in a home, chances are another will follow suit. Such is the case with an English-style home in Hollywood Hills. The charming house has been rented by a number of stars over the years, starting with The Beatles. "It was a rental house for a long time," current owner Mike Clifford said. "When The Beatles played the Hollywood Bowl at the height of their fame, they stayed in the house. David Hockney lived in the home for a couple of years and gave my neighbor a painting." Musician Meat Loaf and author Casey Johnson, daughter of Johnson & Johnson's co-founder, also reportedly leased the home. The former owner was a Hollywood socialite, and through her, stars discovered the 1939-built home for themselves. Of course, most of the home's rental history is hearsay — stories passed from owner to owner and neighbor to neighbor — as rental agreements and lease records aren't kept by the county. The Beatles reportedly stayed in the mid 1960s, followed by artist Hockney in the 1980s. "Hockney was best friends with my neighbor, who told me that he [Hockney] physically painted the bottom of my pool, and then it was subsequently covered over by the owner at the time," Clifford said. "Another story that's kind of funny: The former owner of my house used to sunbathe nude by the pool. The house next door used to be owned by Bert Reynolds, and he used to watch her sunbathe." Clifford bought the 3-bedroom, 2.5-bath home in 2004, saying he loved the light-filled spaces and architecture, unusual for an area dominated by Spanish-style homes. He lived in the home for a year and a half before he, too, rented it out. Now that the market is better and he's spending most of his time in New York, Clifford has decided to sell the home, but he admits that he's sad to let it go. "It's a special place," he said. Listing agent Richard Klug of  Sotheby's International Realty  said an offer has been accepted for the home, but until the deal goes through, it will remain on the  Hollywood Hills real estate market .
