Rudy Kurniawan, who is to be tried
next month on charges of creating more than $1.3 million in
counterfeit wines, may be planning an insanity defense, federal
prosecutors said.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jason Hernandez and Joseph Facciponti yesterday asked the judge overseeing the case to hold
an immediate court conference on a defense request that he allow
Kurniawan to be examined by two hired psychiatric experts.  “The defendant’s request suggests that he may seek to
raise a defense of insanity or claim that he is not competent to
stand trial,” the prosecutors said in a letter to U.S. District
Judge Richard Berman in  Manhattan .  Kurniawan’s lawyer, Vincent Verdiramo, asked in a letter
yesterday that Berman order the federal lockup where his client
is being held to permit the examination by S. Shane Konrad,
M.D., and Virginia Barber-Rioja, Ph.D. The prosecutors said they
are concerned the request is a “last-minute attempt to delay
the trial,” scheduled for Dec. 9.  Verdiramo didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message
seeking comment on the request.  Kurniawan, a  California  wine-seller, was indicted last year
for allegedly consigning at least 84 bottles of counterfeit
Burgundy to a New York auction house. Prosecutors claim
Kurniawan used his Arcadia, California, home as a laboratory for
making phony wines, with thousands of printed labels for many of
the world’s most expensive wines, including Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti and Chateau Petrus.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Kurniawan, 12-cr-00376, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
