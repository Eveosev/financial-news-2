The Pentagon weathered the first year
of automatic  budget cuts  through a “short-term response,”
including delays in modifying and developing weapons that may
cost more later, the Government Accountability Office found.  The Pentagon “was able to protect or minimize disruptions
in certain key areas, such as maintaining support for ongoing
operations and adhering to plans for major weapons systems
acquisitions,” the watchdog agency said in a  report  released
tonight on how Defense Department officials finessed, at least
initially, their own worst-case scenarios on the cuts known as
sequestration.  Among steps taken, the GAO said, the department “made
adjustments to some of its procurement programs, such as
deferring modifications or delaying system development and
testing.” Defense officials said “that some of these decisions
may result in increased costs over the next few years,”
according to the report.  The Pentagon program office for the $391.2 billion F-35
fighter made by  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the costliest weapons
program, absorbed part of the $806 million cut it took “by
delayed research and development work on software.” The plane’s
software has been among its most troubled features, according to
the Pentagon’s testing office.  The Air Force covered reductions for  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s KC-46
tanker by using $143 million “set aside for possible
engineering changes,” according to the draft report.  The Pentagon’s decisions on weapons “generally did not
appear to be arbitrary or overly severe,” and “many programs
reported minor or no impacts.”  Managing Cuts  “As it turned out, they were able to manage sequestration
a lot better than they said they would,”  Todd Harrison , a
defense budget analyst with the Washington-based Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said in an e-mail.  The biggest U.S. contractors have soared this year in  New
York  trading. Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed, the biggest, is
up 48 percent, while  General Dynamics Corp. (GD) , based in  Falls
Church ,  Virginia , has risen 25 percent.  Unless Congress and President  Barack Obama  agree to modify
or repeal sequestration, the Pentagon will have to cut about $52
billion in the current fiscal year. After absorbing $37 billion
in reductions in the year that ended Sept. 30, Defense Secretary
Chuck Hagel and chiefs of the military services are warning that
they’ll have to cut more deeply into procurement and readiness
to deliver on about $500 billion in scheduled reductions over
nine years.  Procurement, Research  “In some cases we will make a shift, for example, by
prioritizing a smaller, modern, and capable military over a
larger force with older equipment,” Hagel said Nov. 5 in a
policy speech in  Washington . He called for preserving funding
for cyberdefense, special operations, space and intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance systems.  Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale said in an interview that
procurement and research accounts may be cut 15 percent this
year, compared with a 6.7 percent reduction in procurement and
an 8.1 percent cut in research in fiscal 2013.  The findings by the GAO, an independent auditing agency
that reports to Congress, also documented the Pentagon’s use of
about $6 billion out of about $63 billion in uncommitted funds
from previous years to cushion the blow of sequestration.  ‘Unobligated Funds’  The “unobligated funds” replaced $4.8 billion of almost
$16 billion in cuts that would have been imposed on procurement
and research accounts, according to the auditors.  The funds made up for 65 percent of the automatic
reductions in vehicle procurement, 51 percent of aircraft
purchases, 51 percent of shipbuilding acquisition and 38 percent
of ammunition purchases.  For the current fiscal year, the Pentagon again plans to
tap into that stash of funds not already under contract.  Hale said “our best estimate” is that program managers
may have access to a pool of as much of $70 billion, part of
which could be used to buffer weapons cuts.  Navy Commander Bill Urban, a spokesman for Hale, said the
GAO report “generally seems technically correct.”  “Sequestration did have serious adverse effects on DoD,”
Urban said. “Coupled with wartime funding shortfalls,” the
cuts “led to significant cutbacks in training funding that
sharply reduced military readiness. These reductions would be
problematic in a major wartime contingency,” Urban said.  In congressional testimony today, General Raymond Odierno,
the Army chief of staff, said the service will be largely
unprepared for war if the budget cuts proceed this year, with 85
percent of brigade combat teams failing to meet readiness
requirements.  South Korea  “If something happens and we’re required to send soldiers,
they might not be prepared,” he said at a Senate Armed Services
Committee hearing, invoking the potential need to defend  South
Korea  or secure chemical weapons in  Syria .  The  Air Force  would have to cut about 25,000 airmen and 550
aircraft over the next five years, while reducing flying hours
for pilots this year by as much as 15 percent, said General Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, in written testimony.  The Marine Corps, which already plans to shrink to 182,100
Marines by fiscal 2016 from a current force of about 194,000,
could afford to keep only 174,000 if the cuts stay in effect,
according to General James Amos, the Marine commandant.  For the Navy, the cuts would require canceling plans to buy
a Virginia-class attack submarine and a Littoral Combat Ship
this year, while delaying by two years the delivery of the USS
Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, said Admiral Jonathan Greenert,
the chief of naval operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
