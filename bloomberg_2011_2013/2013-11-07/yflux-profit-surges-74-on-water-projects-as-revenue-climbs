Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , Singapore’s largest
publicly traded water company, reported a 74 percent rise in
third-quarter earnings, buoyed by municipal projects in  Asia .  Net profit was S$25.3 million ($20.4 million) compared with
S$14.5 million for the year-earlier period, the company said
today in a statement. Third-quarter revenue rose 26 percent to
S$187.7 million.  Completion of projects “markedly lifted growth” while the
China market contributed 4 percent to total revenue in the
quarter, a drop from 14 percent a year earlier. Hyflux also said
it’s “actively pursuing desalination and water-recycling
opportunities in the industrial water sector.”  Hyflux and Singapore’s national water agency PUB opened the
city-state’s largest seawater reverse-osmosis desalination
facility, Tuaspring, in September. Given the Dahej desalination
project in  India  that’s on course for financial close in 2014
and Tuaspring’s completion, Hyflux said it anticipated a slower
fourth quarter. The shares have fallen 8.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
