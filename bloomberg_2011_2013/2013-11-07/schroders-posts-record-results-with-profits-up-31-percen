Schroders Plc (SDR) , the U.K.’s biggest
publicly traded money manager, said profit for the first nine
months of the year rose 31 percent as it completed its
acquisition of Cazenove Capital Holdings Ltd.  Pretax profit before one-time items climbed to 349.6
million pounds ($562 million) from 266 million pounds in the
year-earlier period, the London-based company said in a
statement today.  Assets under management rose 27 percent to 256.7 billion
pounds as the takeover of Cazenove Capital, completed in July,
boosted its private-banking operations. The 424 million-pound
acquisition generated net inflows of about 700 million pounds in
the third quarter, the company said.  “These are strong results,” Chief Executive Officer
Michael Dobson said in the statement. “Schroders is well placed
for further growth as we continue to invest in our business for
the long term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
