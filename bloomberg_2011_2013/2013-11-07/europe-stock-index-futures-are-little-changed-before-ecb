Most stocks in Europe  fell as an
unexpected European Central Bank  interest rate  cut pointed to
prolonged weak growth in the region and stronger U.S. economic
data fueled speculation the  Federal Reserve  may reduce the pace
of its bond buying in the coming meetings.  HeidelbergCement AG dropped 3.8 percent after saying third-quarter profit fell 7 percent. Bureau Veritas SA lost 3.6
percent as quarterly sales missed analysts’ estimates. Siemens
AG rose 3.4 percent after reporting better-than-forecast profit
and saying it plans to buy back shares. Swiss Re Ltd. climbed
1.9 percent after third-quarter net income exceeded predictions.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index lost less than 0.1 percent to
323.23 at the close of trading, paring earlier gains of as much
as 1.5 percent. About three stocks fell for every two that rose.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index surged as much as 1.6 percent to an
intraday level of 3,106.64, the highest since October 2008,
before closing 0.4 percent down today.  “We passed the initial euphoria to begin to think why the
ECB chose to cut rates now when very few of us saw it coming,”
said Michael Woischneck, who helps oversee about $1.6 billion in
equities at Lampe Asset Management in Dusseldorf,  Germany . “A
prolonged period of low interest rates also means a prolonged
period of very weak growth in the euro area. I do think Europe
will recover, but it will take longer than expected.”  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600-listed
companies was 30 percent higher than the 30-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Rate Cut  The ECB lowered its benchmark  interest rate  to 0.25 percent
from 0.5 percent, as  forecast  by three of 70 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The rest predicted no change. The ECB expects
key interest rates to remain at the current level or lower for
an extended period of time, President  Mario Draghi  said at a
press conference after the announcement.  “We may experience a prolonged period of low inflation,”
Draghi told reporters in  Frankfurt . “Accordingly, our monetary
policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as
necessary.”  The  Bank of England  held its key interest rate at 0.5
percent and its asset-purchase target at 375 billion pounds
($603 billion), matching the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes dropped in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. Germany’s DAX gained 0.4 percent,  France ’s CAC
40 slipped 0.1 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.7 percent.  U.S. Growth  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report today showed that
the world’s biggest economy expanded in the third quarter at a
faster pace than forecast. Gross domestic product rose at a 2.8
percent annualized rate after a 2.5 percent gain the prior three
months, beating the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg for a 2 percent advance.  “For the U.S., we’re back to good news is bad news,” said
Woischneck. “A strong GDP number means tapering could happen
sooner than expected. Markets are so afraid that central banks
will cut liquidity.”  HeidelbergCement slipped 3.8 percent to 56.88 euros. The
world’s third-largest maker of cement said quarterly operating
income before depreciation fell to 811 million euros ($1.09
billion) from 872 million euros a year earlier because of weaker
currencies in  emerging markets .  Bureau Veritas  Bureau Veritas (BVI)  fell 3.6 percent to 21.72 euros. The world’s
second-biggest goods-inspection company posted third-quarter
sales of 969.7 million euros late yesterday, trailing the 992
million-euro average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Siemens advanced 3.4 percent to 95.66 euros after saying it
will buy back 4 billion euros of shares over the next two years.
Europe’s biggest engineering company reported fourth-quarter
profit from continuing operations of 1.08 billion euros,
surpassing the 997 million-euro average projection of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Swiss Re rose 1.9 percent to 81.45 Swiss francs after the
world’s second-biggest reinsurer said third-quarter profit fell
to $1.07 billion from $2.18 billion a year earlier. Analysts on
average had predicted profit of $775 million. The sale of a U.S.
unit had boosted earnings in the year-earlier period.  Commerzbank AG jumped 10 percent to 10.26 euros, the
largest gain in almost three months, as Germany’s second-biggest
lender said third-quarter net income rose to 77 million euros.
That beat the average analyst estimate of 32 million euros as
the bank paid fewer taxes and risky-loan provisions climbed less
than expected.  ArcelorMittal Gains  ArcelorMittal added 3.9 percent to 12.42 euros. The world’s
largest steelmaker said Ebitda rose to $1.71 billion in the
third quarter. That surpassed the $1.53 billion average analyst
forecast. Full-year earnings will exceed $6.5 billion, the
company said.  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  gained 2.9 percent to 41.75 euros and
 Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  added 4 percent to 9.16 euros. The French
banks said they are in talks to swap stakes in asset manager
Amundi Group and derivatives broker Newedge Group.  Credit
Agricole  plans to increase its holding in Amundi to 80 percent
from 75 percent, while  Societe Generale  will double its share of
Newedge to 100 percent.  Credit Agricole posted third-quarter profit of 728 million
euros, compared with a 2.85 billion-euro loss a year earlier.
Societe Generale reported third-quarter net income of 534
million euros, missing the average analyst forecast of 635
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
