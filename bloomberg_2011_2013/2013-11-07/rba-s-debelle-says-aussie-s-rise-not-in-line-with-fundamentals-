The Australian currency’s
appreciation hasn’t tracked economic fundamentals, said Guy Debelle, assistant governor for financial markets at the Reserve
Bank of  Australia .  “In Australia’s case, the issue is exchange-rate
appreciation is not in line with fundamentals,” Debelle said
today at an International Monetary Fund conference in
 Washington . The problem for Australia and smaller economies like
it is that “you’ve got an exchange rate moving out of line with
fundamentals because of financial factors,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
