Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose on speculation that efforts to improve air quality
in  China  may crimp production.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, rose as much as 1 percent to 3,677
 yuan  ($603) per metric ton, the biggest gain since Nov. 1.
Futures traded at 3,672 yuan at 11:15 a.m. local time.  The steel industry will face stricter environment
protection rules as the government seeks to improve air quality
this winter, Securities Daily reported today.  “Production is likely to decrease temporarily, which will
help reduce oversupply and support prices,” said  Helen Lau , an
analyst at UOB Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong.  Iron ore  for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
was unchanged at 944 yuan a ton. The steel-making material for
immediate delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel Index
rose 0.2 percent to 137.10 yuan a ton yesterday.  The  spot price  of rebar gained 0.5 percent to 3,550 yuan a
ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
