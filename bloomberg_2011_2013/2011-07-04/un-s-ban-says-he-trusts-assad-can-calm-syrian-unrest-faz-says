United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he believes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is
able to calm domestic social unrest,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported.  “I’m doing my best to appeal to Assad,” Ban told the
newspaper in an interview. “He’s announced a few positive
things, for example a general amnesty and a dialogue with all
groups. I encourage him to implement those announcements and
promises.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
