Vivendi SA (VIV) , the owner of the world’s
largest music and video game companies, raised 1.75 billion
euros ($2.5 billion) from its first bond sale in more than a
year.  The company issued 1 billion euros of four-year bonds and
750 million euros of 10-year securities, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The shorter-dated notes were priced to
yield 95 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate and the
10-year securities were priced at a spread of 145 basis points.  Company bond sales revived last week in  Europe  as relative
yields tumbled from a five month high after Greece approved a
package of austerity measures. Sales of euro- and pound-
denominated debt dropped to 22.5 billion euros in June from 62
billion euros in May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
amid investor concern over the possibility of the region’s first
sovereign default.  The extra yield investors demand to hold investment-grade
European company debt rather than  government securities  fell to
168 basis points from a five-month high of 175 on June 27,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index data.  Vivendi, based in Paris, raised 750 million euros from a
sale of notes due in 2017 on March 24 last year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Those notes were priced at a spread of 125
basis points over swaps.  BNP Paribas SA, Credit Agricole CIB, Deutsche Bank AG and
Societe Generale SA managed the sale of the new notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
