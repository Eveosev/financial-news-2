Eletropaulo Metropolitana SA, the
Brazilian unit of AES Corp., gained the most in more than three
months on speculation BNDES,  Brazil ’s state development bank,
will sell its stake in the utility’s parent company.  Shares rose 4.1 percent to 35.95 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since March
22. The Bovespa index climbed 0.8 percent to 63,891.31.  “It’s hard to predict when this sale could happen, but it
would make sense for BNDES to sell the stake and use the money
to fund its other projects,” Rosangela Ribeiro, an analyst at
SLW Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  BNDES’s subsidiary BNDES Participacoes SA owns a 50 percent
stake in Cia. Brasiliana de Energia, Eletropaulo’s parent
company. The lender is planning the sale and CPFL Energia SA,
Brazil’s largest private-sector power distributor, is a possible
buyer, São Paulo-based Veja magazine reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Eletropaulo denied the sale in an e-mailed statement. A
press official from BNDES, who asked not to be named due to
internal policy, declined to comment when contacted by telephone
by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
