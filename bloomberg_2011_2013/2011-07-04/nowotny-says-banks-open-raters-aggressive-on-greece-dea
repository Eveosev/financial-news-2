European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said policy makers are struggling
with a situation in which banks are willing to help stabilize
 Greece , while rating companies are applying “aggressive”
rules.  Standard & Poor’s  said today a bond-rollover plan drafted
by French banks that serves as the basis for talks between
investors and governments would qualify as a distressed exchange
and prompt a “selective default” grade.  “We have a somewhat strange situation,” Nowotny said in
an  interview  with Austrian state television broadcaster ORF.
“Some of the banks themselves are ready” to contribute to a
new bailout package for Greece “because they are interested in
stabilizing Greece,” he said.  “We are having a difficult discussion with the rating
agencies, which point out and insist that even a partial
restructuring has to be considered a default,” he added. “I
have to say that I and others have noticed that the  ratings
agencies  are in this European issue much stricter and much more
aggressive than they have been in similar cases in, for
instance,  South America ,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
