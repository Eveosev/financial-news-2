Irish  home prices  fell in the second
quarter, extending a housing slump that began in 2007, two
reports published today showed.  House prices fell 5.1 percent from the previous quarter,
the fastest decline in 18 months, property website  Daft.ie  said.
Dublin-based property company  MyHome.ie  said prices fell 4
percent in the second quarter.  “While the worst of the recession is over, serious
challenges remain,” Annette Hughes, director of DKM Economic
Consultants, said in the MyHome.ie report. “Our best hope for
2011 is that some moderation in the rate of decline in asking
prices will begin to emerge over the second half of the year.”  Irish house prices have fallen about 40 percent since
peaking in 2007 as the end of a decade-long property bubble was
compounded by the financial crisis. The economy has shrunk by
around 15 percent since 2007, and the country is seeking a cut
in the interest rate of an 85 billion-euro ($123.5 billion)
European Union aid package it was forced to accept last year.  House prices  in Dublin, the capital, fell by 5.2 percent in
the second quarter, MyHome.ie said. The year-on-year decline in
asking prices in June was 16.5 percent, compared with 14 percent
in November, according to the Daft.ie report. In Dublin, prices
are now 51 percent below their 2007 peak.  The average asking price for a house in Ireland is now
249,000 euros, 40 percent below the peak, according to the
MyHome.ie report. The price of a new home has slipped to 2001
levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
