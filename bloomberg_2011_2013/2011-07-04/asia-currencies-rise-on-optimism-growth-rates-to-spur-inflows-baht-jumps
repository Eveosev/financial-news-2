Asian currencies advanced, led by
 Thailand ’s baht and South Korea’s won, on optimism the world’s
fastest economic growth and rising interest rates will attract
funds to regional assets.  The baht rose to a one-week high after Prime Minister
 Abhisit Vejjajiva  and the defense minister acknowledged an
election victory by allies of exiled former premier Thaksin
Shinawatra, damping concern the result would be disputed and
lead to political instability. South Korea’s government raised
its 2011 inflation estimate last week, fueling speculation
authorities will favor appreciation to combat inflation.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index rose 0.1 percent
to 119.09 as of 5:25 p.m. in Hong Kong, near a 14-year high of
119.26 reached in May. The baht surged 1 percent to 30.49 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  South Korea ’s
won strengthened 0.3 percent to 1,063.50, the  Taiwan dollar 
advanced 0.1 percent to NT$28.752, and Malaysia’s ringgit added
0.2 percent to 3.0040.  “Asia’s strong economic growth continues to drive the
rate-rising trend in the region,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-
based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial
Bank. “That’ll attract more foreign funds to the region and
support regional currencies.”  Growth, Inflows  Developing economies in Asia will expand 8.4 percent in
2011, outpacing growth of 2.5 percent in the U.S. and 2.0
percent in the euro region, according to International Monetary
Fund estimates released last month. Overseas investors bought
$1.1 billion more Indonesian, South Korean and Taiwanese
equities than they sold last week, exchange data show. Net
purchases in  India  totaled $794 million in the three days ended
June 29.  Benchmark  interest rates  of 7.5 percent in India and 6.75
percent in  Indonesia  compare with a maximum 0.25 percent in the
U.S. and  Japan . Taiwan raised its rate to 1.875 percent last
week from 1.75 percent. Data tomorrow will show the island’s
consumer prices gained 1.75 percent in June, the most since
February 2010, while inflation in the  Philippines  accelerated to
a 26-month high of 4.7 percent, Bloomberg surveys show.  The Pheu Thai party, led by Thaksin’s sister Yingluck Shinawatra, won 264 seats in the 500-member parliament and
announced the formation of a five-party, 299-seat coalition.
After Abhisit congratulated Yingluck on “becoming the next
prime minister,” the defense minister said the army accepted
the result.  Thai Election  Global funds slashed their holdings of Thai stocks by $884
million in June and the baht weakened 1.4 percent amid concern
the election would spark violence. The decisive win by Thaksin’s
allies may bring stability to a nation beset by clashes between
his supporters and opponents that claimed more than 100 lives
since the last vote in 2007.  “The majority victory is a very welcome outcome and
foreign investors will come back very quickly,” said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong .
“It cleared a part of the uncertainties and sentiment will
stabilize.”  South Korea’s Inflation  South Korea’s consumer prices rose 4.4 percent from a year
earlier in June, exceeding the central bank’s 4 percent ceiling
for a sixth month and adding to pressure for interest rates to
be raised.  The government raised its 2011 inflation estimate by a
percentage point to 4 percent last week, while trimming its
economic growth forecast to 4.5 percent from 5 percent.  “A mild appreciation in the won is likely to continue,”
Hwang Sun Min, Seoul-based foreign exchange trader with Kookmin
Bank, South Korea’s largest lender. “Policy makers are paying
close attention to high inflation as the economy is relatively
resilient and the stock market is faring quite well.”  Rate Review  The ringgit rose to a four-week high as nine of 14
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast Bank Negara  Malaysia 
will lift its overnight rate by a quarter of a percentage point
to 3.25 percent on July 7. Five predicted the monetary authority
will leave borrowing costs unchanged. Exports rose 11 percent in
May from a year earlier after increasing 11.1 percent the
previous month, the most since July 2010, economists predicted
in a separate survey before government data due tomorrow.  Elsewhere, the Singapore dollar rose 0.1 percent to
S$1.2260 versus the greenback and Indonesia’s rupiah rose 0.2
percent to 8,523.  China ’s yuan was little changed at 6.4629 and
the Philippine peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 43.063. India’s
rupee climbed 0.4 percent to 44.41.  To contact the reporters on this story:
