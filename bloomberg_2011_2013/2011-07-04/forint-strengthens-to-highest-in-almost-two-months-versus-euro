The forint appreciated to a two-month
high after European finance ministers approved an aid payment to
 Greece  to prevent a default.  The Hungarian currency appreciated as much as 0.5 percent
to 263.05, the strongest intraday level since May 11, and traded
up 0.4 percent at 263.43 as of 4:26 p.m. in Budapest. Government
notes maturing in June 2022 rallied, pushing the yield down six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.287 percent.  Euro area finance ministers on July 2 authorized an 8.7
billion-euro ($12.6 billion) loan payout to Greece by the middle
of this month and said they would aim to complete talks with
banks on maintaining their Greek debt holdings within weeks. The
 International Monetary Fund  indicated it would deliver its 3.3
billion-euro share of the payment.  “All this has apparently calmed  currency markets ,”
traders at Commerzbank AG in Budapest including Imre Kerekgyarto
wrote in an e-mailed note today, referring to the Greek aid
payment. The volume of trading in the currency was lower than
average today because of the Independence Day holiday in the
U.S., Kerekgyarto said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
