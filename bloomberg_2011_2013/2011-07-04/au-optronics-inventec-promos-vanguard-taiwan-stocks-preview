Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in  Taiwan  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:30 p.m. in Taipei trading.  The Taiex Index rose 34.90, or 0.4 percent, to 8,774.72.  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT) gained 4.5 percent to NT$1,055 after
the smartphone maker reported June sales that beat analyst
estimates. Growth is expected to continue this quarter, Chief
Financial Officer Winston Jung said.  ProMOS Technologies Inc. (5387)  (5387 TT) surged 6.7 percent to
NT$0.80.  Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp. (5347)  (5347 TT)
offered to buy a ProMOS plant in central Taiwan for NT$10
billion ($349 million), the DigiTimes reported, without saying
where it got the information. Officials at the two companies
said they were unaware of the offer, according to the report.
Vanguard slid 1.6 percent to NT$15.20. Ben Tseng, a spokesman
for ProMOS, didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone. Vanguard
declined to comment in a statement to the Taiwan stock exchange.  Inotera Memories Inc. (3474)  (3474 TT),  Nanya Technology Corp. (2408) 
(2408 TT)’s venture with Micron Technology Inc., surged 7
percent to NT$9.33, the biggest advance since July 2009.
Investors expect Inotera to benefit from new deals by Micron and
after the U.S. chipmaker was upgraded at Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services, said Daniel Tsai, an analyst at Masterlink
Securities Corp.  The stock had also been “oversold,” said Tsai. Inotera
had fallen 33 percent this year, compared with the Taiex index’s
2.1 percent decline. Charles Kau, an Inotera spokesman, didn’t
immediately answer calls to his office. Nanya climbed 6.9
percent to NT$8.52, the largest gain since March 24.  Simplo Technology Co. (6121 TT), a battery pack maker,
climbed 6.9 percent to NT$254.50 on speculation it received
orders for Apple Inc.’s iPhone 5 and iPad3 as well as Hewlett-
Packard Co.’s tablet computer, said Calvin Lu, an analyst at
Mega Securities Co. Huei-min Ting, a spokeswoman for the
company, wasn’t immediately for comment at her office.  Yulon Motor Co. (2201 TT), an automaker, advanced 5.6
percent to a record NT$74 after it was rated “buy” in new
