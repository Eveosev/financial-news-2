The ruble closed at the strongest
level in three weeks as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, rose
in  New York .  The Russian currency appreciated less than 0.1 percent to
27.8275 per dollar by 7 p.m. in Moscow, the fifth day of gains
and the strongest close since June 9. The ruble was steady at
40.3825 per euro, leaving it little changed at 33.4772 versus
the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Crude, Russia’s chief export, has risen about $5 a barrel
in the last week as  Greece  passed new austerity measures and was
authorized to receive an 8.7 billion-euro ($12.6 billion) aid
payment, boosting confidence in the economies of the euro area.
Crude for August delivery traded up 0.4 percent at $95.25 a
barrel at the close of ruble trading.  Russian  government bonds  were also little changed, leaving
the yield on the ruble Eurobond steady at 6.895 percent. Non-
deliverable forwards, which allow companies to hedge against
currency movements, show the ruble at 28.0745 per dollar in
three months, compared with 28.0612 on July 1.  The ruble’s trading hours on the Micex exchange were
extended to close at 7 p.m. on July 1 from 5 p.m. previously.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
