The Hungarian Parliament’s national
security committee will today hold a hearing on the detention of
a former minister in charge of the security agency and two of
the agency’s ex-chiefs.  Gyorgy Szilvasy, who was the minister overseeing the
security apparatus under former Prime Minister  Ferenc Gyurcsany ,
was detained over the weekend along with two former agency
chiefs, Lajos Galambos and Sandor Laborc, state-run news service
MTI said. Laborc was also detained over the weekend and Galambos
last week, MTI said.  The parliamentary committee will hold a hearing on the case
with Interior Minister Sandor Pinter present, Agnes Vadai, an
opposition lawmaker who chairs the parliamentary committee, told
reporters yesterday in Budapest. The three were suspected of
“anti-state crimes,” Vadai said without elaborating.  “I talked to Szilvasy’s family,” Ex-Premier Gyurcsany,
who resigned in 2009, wrote on his Facebook page on July 2.
“What is clear is that Gyuri was detained at dawn, suspected of
an anti-state crime,” Gyurcsany wrote, referring to Szilvasy by
his nickname.  Miklos Horanyi, spokesman at the Prosecution Service,
declined to comment on the case when reached by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
