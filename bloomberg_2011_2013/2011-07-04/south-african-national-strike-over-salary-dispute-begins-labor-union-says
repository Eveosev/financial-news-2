A national strike by the National
Union of Metalworkers of  South Africa  started today following a
pay dispute in the country’s steel and engineering industries,
Numsa spokesman Castro Ngobese said.  The labor union expects “wide support” for the industrial
action, Ngobese said by phone. As many as 320,000 can
participate in the industrial action, the labor union said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday.  The union is demanding wage increases of 13 percent, while
the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa,
which represents employers, is offering 7 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
