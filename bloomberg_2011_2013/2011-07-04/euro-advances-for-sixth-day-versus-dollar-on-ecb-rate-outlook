The euro advanced for a sixth day
versus the dollar amid speculation the  European Central Bank 
will increase interest rates this week.  The 17-member common currency climbed to a three-week high
against the greenback, buoyed after European finance ministers
last week authorized an 8.7 billion-euro ($12.7 billion) loan
payout to  Greece  by mid-July. Gains were limited after  Standard
& Poor’s  said a French rollover plan for the debt-stricken
Mediterranean nation may put it in “selective default.”  The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.4553 as of 7:56 a.m. in
London, after earlier appreciating as much as 0.4 percent. It
was little changed against the Japanese currency at 117.36 yen.
The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 80.65 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
