Swiss Re Ltd., the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, said European property insurers may face
“major” claims from drought-induced soil subsidence.  Climate change  will raise the risk of subsidence in large
parts of  France , the U.K. and  Germany , the Zurich-based
reinsurer said in a study published today. Spain, Italy and
eastern  Europe  may also be affected, Swiss Re said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
