India ’s  Supreme Court  appointed a
panel headed by a former judge to monitor a government
investigation into illegal funds stored in foreign banks and
steps being taken to return the money.  Judges also directed the government to disclose the names
of those who have been issued notices for holding money overseas
to evade tax in India.  India loses about $16 billion a year in tax revenue because
of the use of foreign accounts by wealthy individuals and
companies, the Washington-based  Global Financial Integrity , a
non-government organization campaigning for tighter controls on
tax havens, estimated in a report last year.  “Illicit outflows” from India between 1948 and 2008 may
be worth at least $462 billion at current prices, it said.  The government has said it is discussing steps including
offering amnesty, strengthening laws and signing double-taxation
avoidance agreements with governments to curb tax-evasion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
