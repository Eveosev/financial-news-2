Ushdev International Ltd. (UTF) , a wind-
farm owner and  India ’s third-largest non-state metal trader,
received part of the 70 million rupees ($1.6 million) it’s owed
by  Tamil Nadu  for power sold since last year.  State-run utility Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution
Corp. paid 15 million rupees to Ushdev Power Holdings Pvt. on
July 1 for wind power supplied in September 2010, Arvind Prasad,
managing director of Ushdev’s wind power unit, said by telephone
today from Mumbai. Ushdev supplies 14 megawatts to the state
utility.  Indian state utilities are struggling to pay for the power
they buy because of financial problems. Tamil Nadu state, home
to 40 percent of the nation’s installed wind capacity, owes 12
billion rupees to project owners, according to the Indian Wind
Power Association.  Ushdev shares were down 1.2 percent at 314 rupees at 10:52
a.m. after rising as much as 15 percent earlier in Mumbai
trading. The benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock
Exchange gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
