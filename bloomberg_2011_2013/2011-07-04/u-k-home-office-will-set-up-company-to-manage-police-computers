The U.K. Home Office will set up a
company to manage the different computer systems of the
country’s police forces, in an effort to save officers time and
the government money.  “The way we do things now is confused, fragmented and
expensive,” Home Secretary Theresa May said in a speech to
senior police officers today in Harrogate, northern  England .
“We know, for example, that one supplier now has over 1,500
contracts across all the forces. This would simply never happen
in the commercial world. Across the police service there are
around 5,000 staff, working on over 2,000 ICT systems, across
100 data centers.”  Police spending on computer systems is 1.2 billion pounds
($1.9 billion) a year, May said. She said the new company, to be
set up in the first half of 2012, will be owned by the police,
and the government and private companies may also take stakes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
