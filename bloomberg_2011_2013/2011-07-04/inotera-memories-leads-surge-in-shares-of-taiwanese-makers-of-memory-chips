Inotera Memories Inc. (3474) ,  Nanya
Technology Corp (2408) ’s venture with Micron Technology Inc., surged
the most since 2009 in Taipei trading.  The stock jumped 7 percent to NT$9.33, set for the biggest
advance since July 2, 2009. Investors expect Inotera to benefit
from Micron’s new deals and after Micron’s rating was raised at
Standard & Poor’s, said Daniel Tsai, an analyst at Masterlink
Securities Corp. The stock had also been “oversold,” said
Tsai. Inotera had fallen 33 percent this year, compared with the
Taiex index’s 2.1 percent decline. Charles Kau, an Inotera
spokesman, didn’t immediately answer calls to his office. Nanya
Tech climbed 6.9 percent to NT$8.52.  To contact the reporter on this story:
