Bangladesh will buy 165 tank wagons
and six brake vans from Indian manufacturer  Texmaco Ltd. (TXM)  in a
deal worth $16.5 million as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today
announced he would visit his eastern neighbor in September.  Bangladesh is buying the wagons and vans using part of a $1
billion line of credit from  India  announced last year, according
to a government statement. The wagons and vans will be used to
supply oil to power plants, Bangladesh’s Communications Minister
Syed Abul Hossain said after the contract was signed in Dhaka.  Singh will visit Bangladesh Sept. 6 and Sept. 7, according
to a statement on the website of India’s Ministry of External
Affairs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
