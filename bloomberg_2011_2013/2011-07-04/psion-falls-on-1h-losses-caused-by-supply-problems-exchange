Psion Plc (PON) , a maker of mobile
computing devices, dropped the most since July 2006 in London
trading after announcing a 4 million-pound ($6.4 million) loss
in the first half of 2011 because of supply-chain problems and
sterlingâ€™s weakness against the dollar.  Psion forecast an improvement in the second half of the
year on continued growth in sales of the EP10, a low-cost
personal organizer, and roaming technology. Units shipped this
year have risen by 3 percent over the same period a year ago.  Psion shares fell as much as 22 percent before closing 17
percent lower at 74.25 pence as of 4:30 p.m., giving the London-
based company a market value of 104.5 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
