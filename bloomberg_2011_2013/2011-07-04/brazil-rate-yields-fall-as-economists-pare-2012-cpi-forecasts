Yields on  Brazil ’s interest-rate
futures contracts maturing in April 2012 or later declined as
traders cut bets on how much policy makers will raise borrowing
costs after economists pared estimates for inflation next year.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 dropped three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.64 percent. The
contract due in January 2012 was unchanged at 12.46 percent.  Economists covering the Brazilian economy cut their outlook
for 2012 inflation for a second straight week, projecting
consumer prices will rise 5.10 percent next year, according to
the median forecast in a July 1 central bank survey of about 100
economists published today. They forecast inflation of 5.15
percent the previous week. The yield declined as traders
responded to the reduction in economists’ projections, said
 Newton Rosa , chief economist at Sul America Investimentos.  “There was a lowering of expectations, especially for
2012,” Rosa said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Consumer prices rose 6.55 percent in the year through mid-
June. The central bank aims to slow inflation back to the 4.5-
percent midpoint of its target range in 2012.  Policy makers raised  interest rates  for a fourth
consecutive meeting last month, increasing the benchmark lending
rate a quarter-point to 12.25 percent. Yields on interest-rate
futures contracts indicate traders expect another 25 basis point
increase this month.  The real gained 0.2 percent to 1.5534 per dollar, from
1.5560 on July 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
