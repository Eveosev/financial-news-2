CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, signed an agreement with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance
Corp. for a 12-year loan of 100 million euros ($145 million) to
expand and modernize the Albanian electricity grid.  The loan was signed on July 1, with each institution
providing half of the funds, the Prague-based utility said today
in a regulatory filing.  “Albanian distribution network is very obsolete,” Marek Hatlapatka, an analyst at Cyrrus brokerage, said in a note.
“CEZ incurs very high losses on this market, caused by the bad
condition of the distribution network as well as by high level
of electricity theft.”  The Czech power producer bought the Albanian national
network in 2009 and said it would invest as much as $47 million
this year. The company paid 102 million euros for a 76 percent
stake.  CEZ also said it signed a framework agreement on a domestic
debt program worth as much as 30 billion koruna ($1.8 billion),
arranged by  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) ,  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ’s Czech unit
Ceska Sporitelna and CSOB AS, the Prague-based unit of  KBC Groep
NV (KBC) , according to a statement. The company said it expects to
make the first  bond issue  within the framework by September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
