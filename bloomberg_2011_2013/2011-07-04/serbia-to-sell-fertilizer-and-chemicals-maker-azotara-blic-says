Serbia may begin the sale of chemical
producer  HIP-Azotara  d.o.o. later this year,  Blic  reported,
citing Dusan Bajatovic, the head of  Srbijagas , which controls
Azotara.  State-run Srbijagas, which took over Azotara in 2009 when
it converted its debt for natural gas into equity, expects that
the Pancevo-based plant “will have a strategic partner in no
more than a year” after supervising a restructuring of
operations, the newspaper quoted Bajatovic as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
