John Menzies Plc (MNZS) , which provides
aviation support services and distributes newspapers and
magazines, said it’s “on track” to exceed its board’s
expectations after the “positive start” to the year has
continued.  The Edinburgh-based company’s shares rose as much as 8.9
percent to 550 pence in London trading and ended up 7.9 percent
at the 4:35 p.m. close.  John Menzies has experienced “increased contract win
momentum and generally positive trading at Menzies Aviation,”
while Menzies Distribution still operates in “challenging”
markets, it said in a statement today.  The company’s shares have risen 15 percent in the year to
date, leaving it with a market capitalization of 322.7 million
pounds ($519 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
