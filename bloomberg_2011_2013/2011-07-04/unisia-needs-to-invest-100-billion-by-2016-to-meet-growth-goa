Tunisia  must invest $100 billion in
the next five years to fulfill its pre-revolution plans to grow
6.5 percent and add 100,000 jobs annually, said Abdelhamid
Triki, minister of planning and international cooperation.  The country will raise $15 billion through foreign direct
investments, Triki said in a June 30 interview in  Jeddah , Saudi
Arabia. The funds will be channeled to highly technical
industries such as telecommunications and information
technology, he said.  Economic growth won’t exceed 1 percent this year as tourism
and many economic activities have been affected by a popular
revolt that toppled President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Triki
said. The economy may expand 5.4 percent next year and 7.6
percent in 2016, he said. The  International Monetary Fund 
forecasts 4.9 percent growth next year and 7 percent in 2016.  Foreign direct investment in Tunisia fell 24 percent in the
first five months of 2011 from a year earlier because of the
unrest, Triki said. Still, only 41 of 3,200 foreign-owned
businesses in Tunis stopped operations in that period.  “This is a small number, and most of the 41 companies are
in the  textile industry , which is facing difficulties because of
global conditions,” he said.  Changes within the government are easier to make and
corruption is dropping following the so-called Jasmine
Revolution, Triki said.  “Disclosure and transparency are much better now than
before the revolution,” he said. “A foreign investor can now
get all the information he wants from any government agency
without any reservation.”  Tunisia issued a 20-measure overhaul program following the
fall of Ben Ali’s regime, 17 of which have already been
implemented, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
