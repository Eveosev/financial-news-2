European producer-price inflation
slowed more than economists forecast in May as the economic
recovery faltered and  oil prices  retreated.  Factory-gate prices  in the euro region increased 6.2
percent from a year earlier after rising 6.7 percent in April,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Economists had projected a gain of 6.3 percent, according to the
median of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg news survey. Prices fell
0.2 percent from April, when they rose 0.9 percent.  Crude-oil prices have retreated 13 percent over the past
two months, easing pressure on companies to pass on higher
costs. While the euro-region economy is showing signs of
slowdown after expanding at the fastest pace in almost a year in
the first quarter, the  European Central Bank  has signaled it’s
ready to raise its benchmark rate further to fight price
pressures when policy makers meet on July 7.  Energy prices at the producer level jumped 11.9 percent
from a year earlier after a 13.2 percent gain in April, today’s
report showed. The cost of intermediate goods such as  car
engines  and steel rose 6.6 percent, down from a 7.3 percent
increase in the previous month, while capital goods including
equipment and machinery were 1.2 percent more expensive.  The ECB last month forecast inflation to average 2.6
percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2012. President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said on June 30 the monetary policy stance is “still
accommodative” and policy makers are “in a state of strong
vigilance” to prevent pressures from feeding into wages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
