Angola  is ready to hold talks with
the Democratic Republic of Congo about sharing oil resources
along their common maritime border, Oil Minister Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos said.  Angola signed an agreement with the Republic of Congo last
month that will pave the way for joint oil production to start
by the end of 2013 or early in 2014.  “It’s possible that by the end of 2013, early 2014, we will
start having joint operations,” Vasconcelos said in a July 1
interview in the Angolan capital of Luanda.  Angola is now seeking to sign a similar deal with the DRC.
“On our side we are open and we are ready,” the minister said.
“We expect that the other side also sends us these signals.”  Agencia Angola press cited Vasconcelos as saying on June 30
that negotiations with the DRC were going “very slowly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
