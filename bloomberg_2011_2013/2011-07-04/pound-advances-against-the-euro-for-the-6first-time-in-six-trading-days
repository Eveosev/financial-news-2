The pound strengthened against the
euro for the first time in six sessions, recovering from a 15-
month low reached against the shared European currency at the
end of last week.  The pound appreciated 0.3 percent to 90.13 pence per euro
as of 8:09 a.m. in  London , from a close of 90.39 pence on July 1
when it reached 90.84 pence, the weakest intraday level since
March 2010.  Reports scheduled for release today may show a gauge of
