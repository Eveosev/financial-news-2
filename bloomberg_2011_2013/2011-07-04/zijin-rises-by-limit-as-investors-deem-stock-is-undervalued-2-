Zijin Mining Group Co.,  China ’s
biggest gold producer by market value, jumped by its daily 10
percent limit in Shanghai as investors judged the stock
inexpensive relative to the company’s earnings prospects.  The shares rose 0.5 yuan, the largest gain since Oct. 8, to
close at 5.28 yuan. The stock went ex-dividend today as the
company gave shareholders five bonus shares and a 1-yuan cash
dividend for every 10 shares held.  Zijin Mining spilled 2.4 million gallons of acidic waste
from its Zijinshan mine in  Fujian province  in July last year,
polluting the Ting river and poisoning enough fish to feed
72,000 people for a year. The stock trades at 17 times its
estimated 2011 profit, 32 percent cheaper than the 25 times for
its full-year average last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Zijin shares have traded low after the company’s toxic
spill last year,” said Owen Liang, an analyst with Guotai Junan
Securities Co. in Shenzhen. “Purchases were also triggered as
Chinese investors seek companies that give a high number of
bonus shares.”  A nine-day delay in disclosing the spill prompted the
securities regulator to start an investigation. It was the worst
accident in the Chinese gold mining industry since July 2008,
when runoff from a Zhongjin Gold Corp. site in Dandong poisoned
the water supply of 210,000 people.  Zijin has risen 38 percent in the past year because of
higher gold prices, lagging behind a 45 percent increase in
Shanghai-traded Shandong Gold Mining Co. and Zhongjin Gold
Corp.’s 46 percent gain.  Spot gold prices climbed 0.3 percent to $1,492.35 an ounce
today, taking the gain to 24 percent in the past year.  --Helen Yuan. Editors: Indranil Ghosh, Ryan Woo.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
