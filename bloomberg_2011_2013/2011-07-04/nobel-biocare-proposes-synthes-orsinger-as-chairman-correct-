Nobel Biocare AG proposed  Synthes
Inc. (SYST)  Chief Executive Officer Michel Orsinger as its new
chairman, replacing Heino von Prondzynski.  Orsinger’s appointment takes effect early next year, Nobel
said in a statement on its website today. He will start
attending board meetings immediately as a guest, the Glattbrugg,
Switzerland-based company said.  Nobel in April reported a 67-percent drop in first-quarter
net income to 12.9 million euros ($19 million) and submitted a
non-binding bid for AstraZeneca’s Astra Tech dental-implant
business. Vice Chairman Rolf Watter will head the board on an
ad-interim basis, the company said.  The board is “very pleased” with the work of CEO Richard Laube, Nobel said. Orsinger’s appointment has the unanimous
approval of the company’s board, Nobel Biocare said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
