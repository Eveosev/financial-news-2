Uganda ’s sugar retail prices jumped
as much as 27 percent after traders announced plans to strike on
July 6 and 7, the Uganda Sugar Cane Technologists Association
said.  The sweetener was selling at between 3,500 shillings
($1.40) and 3,800 shillings a kilogram (2.2 pounds) compared
with 3,000 shillings on July 1, Wilberforce Mubiru, the agency’s
secretariat manager said today by phone from the capital,
Kampala. Kampala City Traders Association announced yesterday
their members will go on strike to protest against a weaker
currency.  “It is purely speculation which has driven up prices
because factory prices haven’t changed,” said Mubiru.  The shilling has depreciated 8 percent against the dollar
this year and was trading at 2,505 to the dollar at 10 a.m. in
Kampala. Uganda’s three main sugar plants may boost output 20
percent to 345,570 metric tons this year, from 292,052 tons in
2010, according to the association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
