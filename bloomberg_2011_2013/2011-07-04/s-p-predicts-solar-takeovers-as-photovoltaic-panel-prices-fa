Solar-panel makers in  China  will
increase their market share as overcapacity and falling prices
force weaker foreign competitors to seek takeovers or go out of
business, Standard & Poor’s forecast.  Chinese producers including Yingli Green Energy Holding Co.
and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  that benefit from government support are
driving down the price of photovoltaic panels even as it crimps
their profit margins to pressure European rivals that face
higher costs, credit analyst Swami Venkataraman said in a
research report.  “China has become the dominant producer,” Venkataraman
said. “The exit of high-cost, stand-alone panel manufacturers
will become inevitable in the next few years unless an explosion
in demand allows all producers to thrive.”  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , based in Tempe,  Arizona , is likely to
remain the market leader because its cadmium telluride
generators cost at least 30 percent less to produce than the
polysilicon panels made in China, Venkataraman said.  “Even if poly prices were to fall significantly below the
current spot price of about $50 per kilogram ($22.70 a pound),
First Solar would still have a significant edge over the lowest-
cost Chinese players,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
