Russian local stock valuations will
increase, closing the gap with global depositary receipts, as
President Dmitry Medvedev lifts curbs on domestic share trading,
 Renaissance Capital  said.  The discount on local shares is “likely to disappear by
Sept. 1, the deadline for when the new GDR issuance rules are to
be shaped,”  Ovanes Oganisian , a Moscow-based strategist at
Renaissance Capital, said in a report dated today.  Medvedev is removing restrictions on listings of Russian
securities abroad and letting foreigners open accounts, the
Kremlin said on July 1. The benchmark Micex Index jumped 1.9
percent that day to the highest level since April 29.  The new law may be “developed, rather than implemented”
on Sept. 1, Oganisian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
