The  PGA Tour  of Australasia added an
event in New Caledonia to its schedule through 2015, taking the
golf circuit to the French territory for the first time.  The inaugural South Pacific Golf Open Championship is
scheduled for Sept. 14-17 at Tina Golf Club in Noumea, the
capital of the nation of about 256,000 people. It will be fully
sanctioned and count toward the Order of Merit, the Tour said.  The winner will also gain a berth at the Australasian
tour’s biggest events including the Australian Open, Australian
 PGA Championship , New Zealand Open and Australian Masters.  “The elevation of this event to the PGA Tour of
Australasia means a lot to us,” Tournament Director Patrick
Koch said in an e-mailed statement. “Hopefully this will be the
start of something big.”  The par-72  Tina Golf Club , whose 5,889 meters are laid out
through mangrove plantations, is one of three 18-hole golf
courses in New Caledonia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
