Greek authorities forced back to
shore a Canadian ship that tried to leave the island of Crete to
sail to the  Gaza Strip .  The “ Tahrir ” left the port of Aghios Nikolaos before
being followed, controlled and towed back to shore, the
coastguard said in an e-mailed statement today.  The ship is part of a flotilla aimed at breaking  Israel ’s
blockade of Gaza.  Greece  imposed July 1 a blanket ban on the
vessels from leaving its ports. The country arrested the captain
of the U.S.-flagged “Audacity of Hope” on July 2 after the
vessel attempted to leave Crete for Gaza.  Israel said it won’t allow the flotilla to reach the Hamas-
controlled Palestinian territory. Greece said yesterday it is
willing to transfer any aid on the ships to the Palestinians
rather than having activists try to break the embargo.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
