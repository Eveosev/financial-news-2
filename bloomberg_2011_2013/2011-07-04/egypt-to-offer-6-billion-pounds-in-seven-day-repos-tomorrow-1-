Egypt ’s central bank will offer 6
billion Egyptian pounds ($1 billion) of seven-day repurchase
agreements, or repos, tomorrow.  The contracts allow banks to sell  government securities  to
the central bank to access funds at an interest rate of 9.25
percent, according to Central Bank of Egypt data on Bloomberg.
The central bank accepted 16.7 billion pounds of securities as
collateral last week in the final sale of the fiscal year that
ended in June.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.7 percent at
4:19 p.m. in Cairo. The pound strengthened 0.2 percent, the most
since Feb. 8, to 5.9551 against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
