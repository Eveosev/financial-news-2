European stocks were little changed
after finance ministers approved an aid payment to  Greece , while
 Standard & Poor’s  said plans for banks to roll over the nation’s
debt may lead to a “selective default.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose less than 0.1 percent to
275.11 at 8:02 a.m. in  London  after last week surging the most
in almost a year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
