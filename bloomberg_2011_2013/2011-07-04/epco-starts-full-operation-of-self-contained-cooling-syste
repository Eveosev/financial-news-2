Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s self-
contained cooling system that uses recycled water to douse
smoldering reactors at its crippled nuclear is working for a
third day after repeated stops and starts.  The company known as Tepco started cooling reactors at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant using only decontaminated water at 6
p.m. on July 2 after the suspension of the system for a third
time the day before to install a so-called buffer tank. The
system has been running without any halts, said spokesman
Naoyuki Matsumoto.  The successful operation means Tepco doesn’t have to add
fresh water for cooling, allowing it to reduce the quantity of
highly contaminated water lying in basements and trenches. The
company has been pouring millions of liters of water onto three
melted reactors to keep them cool since the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami knocked out power and cooling at the plant.  Tepco last week began re-using the water that’s been
decontaminated with equipment supplied by Areva SA and Kurion
Inc. and its use means the company has taken a step forward in
achieving its goal of bringing the reactors into a safe state,
known as cold shutdown, by January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
