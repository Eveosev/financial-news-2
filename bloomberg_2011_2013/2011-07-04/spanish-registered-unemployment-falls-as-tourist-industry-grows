Spain ’s registered unemployment
dropped in June for the third month as a recovery in the
country’s tourist industry created jobs.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits fell
by 67,858 or 1.62 percent from May to 4.12 million, the  Labor
Ministry  in  Madrid  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Spain received 7.3 percent more tourists in the five months
through May than a year earlier and the Bank of Spain said on
June 29 that the industry, which accounts for about 10 percent
of the economy, is showing “strong dynamism.” Spain has the
highest unemployment rate in the euro area and about a third of
the region’s jobless are in Spain, according to the European
Union’s statistics office, as the economy struggles to emerge
from a three-year slump.  The doubling of the  unemployment rate  to 21 percent since
the collapse of a decade-long property boom and the deepest
budget cuts in at least three decades have eroded support for
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose Socialist
government suffered its worst local-election defeats in more
than 30 years on May 22.  The opposition  People’s Party  might win 45.9 percent of the
vote if general elections were held now, according to a poll
published by the newspaper El Mundo on June 5, compared with
32.1 percent for the Socialists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
