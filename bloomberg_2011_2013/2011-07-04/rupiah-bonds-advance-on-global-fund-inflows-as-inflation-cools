Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced to a
three-week high as overseas investors boosted holdings of the
nation’s assets after consumer-price increases cooled for a
fifth month in June.  The currency strengthened for a fourth day after global
funds bought $207 million more Indonesian stocks than they sold
last week, exchange data show. Inflation will likely continue to
ease and the rupiah will strengthen in the second half, Bank
Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution told reporters July 1.
Consumer prices rose 5.54 percent last month from a year earlier,
after climbing 5.98 percent in May, data showed last week.  “The fundamentals of the economy are strong and the lower
inflation will mean  interest rates  will be kept unchanged,”
said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth
in Jakarta.  The rupiah gained 0.2 percent to 8,523 per dollar as of
4:16 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 8,517 earlier, the strongest level since
June 13.  Policy makers will meet on July 12 to review the benchmark
lending rate, which has been kept unchanged at 6.75 percent
since February.  Offshore investors  increased  holdings of Indonesia’s
government debt by 4.3 percent to 234.99 trillion rupiah ($27.6
billion) last month, according to data from the  finance ministry .  Gross domestic product will likely increase 6.6 percent in
2011, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said in a
parliamentary hearing in Jakarta today. That’s higher than the 6
percent to 6.5 percent estimated by the central bank last month.  Ten-year benchmark bonds rose for a fourth day. The yield
on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 7.47 percent, according to prices from
the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
