ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  is in negotiations to
sell Blohm+Voss, its civilian shipbuilding business, to one
foreign investor,  Handelsblatt  reported today, citing
unidentified people at the German company.  On July 1, ThyssenKrupp,  Germany ’s largest steelmaker, said
it’s seeking a buyer for Blohm+Voss after failing to reach a
joint-venture agreement with Abu Dhabi MAR after two years of
talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
