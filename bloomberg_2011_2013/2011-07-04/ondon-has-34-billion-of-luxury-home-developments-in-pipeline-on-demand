London has a pipeline of luxury-home
developments valued at about 21 billion pounds ($34 billion) as
a shortage of properties helped push prices to a record and
spurred new projects, according to  EC Harris LLP.   Investors and developers plan to build 9,000 prime
apartments and houses by the end of the decade that they’re
aiming to sell for more than 1,000 pounds a square foot,
according to a study released today by the  London-based
consulting firm . Of this amount, 4,000 units are scheduled to
open in 2014 and 2015, EC Harris estimates.  Prices for prime residential properties in neighborhoods
such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington climbed to a record in
June, real estate broker Knight Frank LLP estimates, as overseas
buyers were attracted to London because of the weak pound and to
find a haven for their wealth. Savills Plc, another broker,
estimates that foreign buyers will spend 3.7 billion pounds
buying prime residences in the British capital this year.  “ London  prime residential developers need to have a robust
and realistic business plan,” said Mark Farmer, head of private
residential consulting at EC Harris. Pitfalls include failing to
ensure properties “will suit the unique requirements of an
increasingly discerning future market.”  Among the new development projects are KOP Properties Pte.
Ltd.’s revamp of  10 Trinity Square , which is opposite the Tower
of London, and Richard Caring’s plans to convert the former U.S.
Navy building on Grosvenor Square to luxury apartments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
