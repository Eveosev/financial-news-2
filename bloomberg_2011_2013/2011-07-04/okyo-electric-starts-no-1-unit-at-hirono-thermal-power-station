Tokyo Electric Power Co. restarted
the No. 1 600-megawatt unit at its Hirono thermal-power plant in
Fukushima prefecture yesterday, Satoshi Watanabe, a
spokesman for the utility, said by telephone.  Tokyo Electric is trying to bring more capacity online to
deal with higher summer demand for electricity after the March
11 earthquake and tsunami damaged its Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
power station and closed down another.  The No. 1 unit at Hirono was idled for maintenance when the
earthquake struck, Watanabe said. Units 2 and 4 were shut in the
disaster.   To contact the reporter on this story:
