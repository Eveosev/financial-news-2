South Korea  said overseas investors’
net holdings of the nation’s bonds reached a record 81.1
trillion won ($76 billion) in June while stock holdings declined.  Net investment in bonds rose by 2.2 trillion won, the fifth
straight month of gains, led by purchases from  Singapore , the
 Financial Supervisory Service  said in an e-mailed statement
today. U.S. investors remained the largest buyers of South
Korean debt, accounting for almost 21 percent of holdings,
according to the FSS.  Overseas investors reduced their holdings of South Korean
stocks last month to 392.9 trillion won amid uncertainty over
Greek debt restructuring and concern that advanced economies may
slowdown, the FSS said.  U.S. investors were the biggest sellers of South Korean
stocks, with a net 504.1 billion won of sales last month. The
U.S. remained as the biggest foreign stock holder, with 154.6
trillion won of shares, according to the FSS.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  declined 2 percent in June, falling for
second straight month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
