(Corrects volume of deals and Citigroup’s ranking in third
paragraph.)  Citigroup Inc. (C)  hired Zheng Jianping
from  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  as head of mergers advisory for
industrial companies in Asia, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  Zheng started working at Citigroup today and will advise
companies in industries ranging from metals and mining to heavy
equipment on acquisitions, and primarily focus on China, the
people said, asking not to be identified because the hiring
hasn’t been made public.  Mergers and acquisitions by companies in the industrial,
metals and mining industries in the Asia-Pacific region jumped
50 percent last year to $200 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Citigroup ranked 11th last year among advisers on
such deals, the data show.  Zheng joined Blackstone in September 2008 from HSBC
Holdings Plc along with a team from Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., as the world’s biggest buyout firm was seeking to expand
its mergers advisory business in Asia.  Johan van Jaarsveld, a managing director at Blackstone’s
mergers advisory unit, left earlier this year to join  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in  Hong Kong .  Peter Rose, a New York-based spokesman at Blackstone,
couldn’t immediately be reached outside of regular business
hours to comment on Zheng’s departure. Citigroup spokesman
Godwin Chellam declined to comment.  Zheng will report to Colin Banfield, Asia-Pacific head of
mergers and acquisitions, and to Michael Borch, head of
industrials investment banking for the region, one of the people
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
