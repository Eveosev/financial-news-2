Tunisia  plans to invest $2 billion in
solar projects to generate power for  Europe , the minister of
planning and international cooperation said.  Tunisia is building 40 solar projects with foreign partners
from  Germany  and other countries, and they will start providing
electricity to Europe by 2016, Tunisia’s Abdelhamid Triki said
in an interview in Jeddah,  Saudi Arabia . The power will be
transferred by a submarine cable to Europe through Italy, he
said. Triki didn’t say how much electricity will be generated in
the project.  About 60 percent of the financing for the solar projects
will come from the private sector, and the rest will come from
the government and other sources, he added. Tunisia is also
planning wind-power projects, Triki said.  Nur Energie Ltd. accepted technical terms for the
projecting to bring Tunisian power onto the Italian grid,
according to a June 1 statement. Under terms of the offer,
Terna, the Italian high-voltage transmission network operator,
agreed to import 2,000 megawatt of solar power produced in the
Tunisian desert, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
