A client of  BNP Paribas (BNP)  Wealth
Management claimed in a  Singapore  court today that the unit of
 Europe ’s largest bank by assets made unauthorized trades that
led to a S$1.1 million ($898,000) shortfall in his account.  Nitine Jantilal, a BNP client since 2002, is asking the
bank to account for the loss in his account, which fell to S$4.2
million in July 2009, said his lawyer,  T. Kulasingam Sureshan .
Jantilal didn’t know about some transactions carried out by the
bank or authorize certain withdrawals, Sureshan said.  “The primary complaint is about the unlawful withdrawals
from the accounts,” Sureshan told Singapore High Court Justice
Choo Han Teck at the start of an eight-day trial.  BNP Paribas denies wrongdoing and was authorized to carry
out the trades in question, K. Muralidharan Pillai, a lawyer for
the bank, said in court.  Wealth-management clients have sued private banks in  Asia 
since the 2008 financial crisis as they suffered investment
losses. UBS AG was sued by a former client who sought to recoup
$12.6 million, claiming the bank breached its duty. BNP Paribas
Wealth Management was also sued by two former private banking
clients in Singapore who alleged they were deceived into buying
high-risk investment products that caused an $11 million loss.  The case is Nitine Jantilal v. BNP Paribas Wealth
Management S1048/2009 in the Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporters on this story:
