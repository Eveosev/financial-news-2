Middle East crude oils for sale to
 Asia  rose against their benchmarks on expectations by refiners
that producers will reduce official prices for lighter grades.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s Murban for August loading
climbed 25 cents to a discount of 33 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Qatar Land increased 27 cents to 41 cents below its official
level, Bloomberg data showed.  Saudi Arabia  may cut the price of its Extra Light and Light
grades of crude in order to increase sales for August, said four
Asian refiners surveyed by Bloomberg. The country pledged to
offer more supplies following a June 8 Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries meeting where no agreement was reached to
raise output quotas. The  International Energy Agency  followed by
agreeing on June 23 to release crude from its emergency
stockpiles.  “At the lighter end of the spectrum we may see the Kingdom
reducing or at least rolling over official prices for Arab Light
and Extra Light, in line with IEA release and ailing regional
refinery margins,” said Vienna-based consultant JBC Energy
GmbH.  Oman futures for September delivery fell 41 cents to
$106.39 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:06 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,041 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $106.27 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  Oman crude for immediate loading rose 75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $106.97 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September climbed 0.7 percent to $106.71. Murban
gained 0.9 percent to $111.35.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker against the Persian Gulf grade, widened 19
cents to $5.42 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., an oil and refined-products broker in  London .
The exchange for swaps for September rose 12 cents to $4.96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
