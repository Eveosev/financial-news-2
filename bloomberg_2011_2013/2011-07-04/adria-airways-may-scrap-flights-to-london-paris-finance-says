Adria Airways d.d. may cancel routes
to London, Paris and Istanbul as the Slovenian national air
carrier seeks to lower costs, Finance newspaper  reported  without
saying where it obtained the information.  Adria, which like other airlines in the Balkans is
struggling to avoid bankruptcy, is set to receive 50 million
euros ($73 million) from the Slovenian government, according to
the Ljubljana-based newspaper. Adria also expects creditor banks
to convert about 38 million euros of debt into equity, according
to Finance.  -- Editors: Alan Crosby, Andrea Dudikova  To contact the reporter on this story:
