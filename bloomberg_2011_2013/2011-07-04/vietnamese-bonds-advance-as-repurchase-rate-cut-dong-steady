Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose,
snapping a two-day drop, as the central bank reduced borrowing
costs for the first time since October. The dong was steady.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam cut the repurchase rate by one
percentage point to 14 percent effective today, according to an
e-mailed statement. The Southeast Asian nation will slash
 interest rates  in line with inflation, Nguyen Xuan Phuc,
chairman of the government office, said on July 1.  “The move signaled that the central bank will loosen its
monetary policy and people expect bond yields to decline
further,” said Ho Chi Minh City-based Nguyen Duy Phong, an
analyst at ACB Securities Inc.  The yield on five-year bonds fell one basis point to 12.46
percent, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The dong was little changed at 20,590 per dollar as of 4:58
p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,613 today,
its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1
percent on either side of the official rate.  Consumer prices rose 20.82 percent in June from a year
earlier, the most since November 2008, according to official
data.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Ven Ram, Andrew Janes  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
