Copper prices will stay around
current levels, said Eduard Ogay, chief executive officer of
Kazakhmys Corporation LLC. He commented today during an
interview in Astana,  Kazakhstan .  On prices:  “The copper price will stay at the current level but may
grow. If it grows up to $10,000, that would be a short-term
jump.  ‘‘The copper price is expected to be in the current
corridor, but everything will depend on demand through the end
of this year. The price of $10,000 a ton will help to launch new
mines, but it will take two to three years for them to start
production.’’  Copper for three-month delivery rose $25, or 0.3 percent,
to $9,470 a metric ton by 5:14 p.m. on the London Metal
Exchange. Copper for September delivery increased 0.1 percent to
$4.3085 a pound on the Comex in  New York . Comex floor trading is
closed today for  Independence Day .  To contact the reporter on this story:
