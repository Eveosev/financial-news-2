Malaysia’s ringgit rose to near a
one-month high and bonds fell on speculation the central bank
will raise  interest rates  this week to tame the fastest
inflation since March 2009.  The currency strengthened for a fifth day as nine of 14
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast that  Bank Negara
Malaysia  will lift its overnight rate to 3.25 percent on July 7.
Four predicted the monetary authority will leave borrowing costs
unchanged. Exports rose 11 percent in May from a year earlier
after increasing 11.1 percent the previous month, the most since
July 2010, economists predicted in a separate survey before a
trade ministry report tomorrow.  “The market is still looking out for one more rate hike
this quarter and the ringgit is benefiting from a rebound in
appetite,” said Faizal Yussof, a currency trader at KAF
Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “On balance, the global
economy is going through a soft patch, and we are cautious of
the risk to the weaker side in the short term.”  The ringgit advanced 0.3 percent to 3 per dollar as of 4:02
p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency earlier reached 2.9950, the strongest level since
June 6.  Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in May, the most since
March 2009, as the government raised fuel, sugar and electricity
prices this year to claw back subsidies and narrow its  budget
deficit .  Bond Auction  Bank Negara  last raised its policy rate to 3 percent from
2.75 percent on May 5, the first increase since July 2010,
saying the economy was firmly on a steady growth path and
inflation would quicken in the second half. Governor Zeti Akhtar
Aziz said on June 26 the slowdown in the  U.S. economy  was
temporary.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
rose to 55.3 last month from 53.5 in May, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said on July 1, compared with the median forecast
for a drop to 52 in a Bloomberg survey. Readings above 50 signal
expansion.  Malaysia’s three-year notes fell, pushing yields to the
highest level in two weeks.  The yield on the 3.434 percent debt maturing in August 2014
rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.28
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The rate on the 4.262
percent bond due September 2016 jumped four basis points to a
four-week high of 3.55 percent.  The treasury is scheduled to auction more of the 2016
securities and 10-year Shariah-compliant notes later this month,
according to its sale calendar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
