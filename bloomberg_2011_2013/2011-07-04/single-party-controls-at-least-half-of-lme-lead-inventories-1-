One party controls at least half of
lead inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange, and a
sole holder also owns the same amount of stockpiled nickel.  Lead held by one company including open positions rose to
between 50 percent and 79 percent of stocks as of June 30 from
30 percent to 39 percent on the prior day, LME data showed
today. The so-called dominant position is the first since June
10, when one company held more than 90 percent of inventories.  The dominant position in nickel of between 50 percent and
79 percent has been present since May 16, the figures show.  The so-called Warrant Tom Banding Report signals a dominant
position when over 50 percent, according to LME rules. The
exchange uses the report to apply guidelines that oblige owners
of stockpiled metal to lend it out at fixed rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
