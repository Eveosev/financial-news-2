Spanish real-estate investor Jose Ramon Carabante agreed to sell his controlling stake in the
Hispania Formula One team to Thesan Capital SL.  Financial terms weren’t disclosed in a statement by the
team and the Madrid-based buyout firm.  Cadena Ser  radio station
put the fee at 20 million euros ($29 million).  Hispania, a backmarker team in the most-watched motor-
racing series, has struggled to get sponsorship amid an economic
slump in  Spain . Thesan will retain the current management and
seek to make the team “progressively more Spanish,” the
statement said.  Thesan Capital was set up in 2008 with the support of
 Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s largest brokerage, to buy
distressed assets in Spain. Nomura isn’t backing the acquisition
of Hispania, a Thesan spokesman said by telephone.  Hispania has failed to score a point this season and
carried “This Could Be You” branding on its racing cars as it
sought paid advertising for its cars.  Carabante said in a May interview he was using his own
funds to cover part of the team’s 50 million-euro budget. He is
also steering his Murcia-based real estate company, Grupo
Hispania, through the fallout of a housing market collapse in
Spain. Earlier this year, he agreed to about 400 million euros
of debt refinancing for the company.  The Hispania team last week added Australian rookie Daniel
Ricciardo as a driver for the July 10 British Grand Prix at
Silverstone,  England . Its other drivers are Italy’s Vitantonio
Liuzzi and India’s Narain Karthikeyan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
