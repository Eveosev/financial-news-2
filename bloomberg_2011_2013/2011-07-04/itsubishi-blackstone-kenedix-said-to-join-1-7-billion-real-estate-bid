Global Logistic Properties Ltd. (GLP)  was
selected to begin exclusive negotiations to buy about 140
billion yen ($1.8 billion) of warehouses in  Japan , two people
with direct knowledge of the deal said.  Global Logistic, based in  Singapore , will begin the talks
with seller LaSalle Investment Management Inc., said the people,
who asked not to be identified before the negotiations are
completed. Hideko Takee, a spokeswoman for LaSalle, declined to
comment.  At least three other companies including  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ,
 Kenedix Inc. (4321)  and  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  had submitted proposals in
an earlier round of bidding, four people familiar with the deal
said this month. The properties held by LaSalle include 24
warehouses in cities such as Tokyo and  Osaka , they said.  The sale would be the biggest since Mori Trust Co. paid 231
billion yen for Tokyo’s Toranomon Pastoral Hotel in 2007. The
investors are bidding four months after the March 11 earthquake,
Japan’s worst temblor, and as more companies are forecasting
increased hiring and investment in anticipation of higher demand
this year.  Global Logistic, an operator of warehouses near seaport
hubs and partly owned by Government of Singapore Investment
Corp., said in a statement today it declined to comment on
market speculation, adding that it “explores growth
opportunities in important logistics markets.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
