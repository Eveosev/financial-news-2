The European Commission estimates
that introducing a financial-transaction tax on derivatives,
bonds and stocks would generate about 31.5 billion euros ($46
billion) a year,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing
internal calculations of the Brussels-based body.  The commission is considering a tax of 0.1 percent on
proceeds from stocks and bonds trading and a tax of 0.01 percent
on revenue from derivatives trading, the German newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
