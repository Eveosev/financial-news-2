Singapore’s  Straits Times Index (FSSTI) 
gained 0.8 percent to 3,162.43 as of the 12:30 p.m. trading
break. Eight stocks rose for each that fell on the index of 30
companies.  Shares on the measure trade at an average 14.5 times
estimated earnings, compared with about 15.6 times at the end of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The following shares were among the most active in the
market. Stock symbols are in parentheses after the company name.  Global Logistic Properties Ltd. (GLP)  , an operator of
warehouses, added 0.5 percent to S$2.08. The company said it
submitted a bid to buy  LaSalle Investment Management ’s Japan
holdings that include more than 20 industrial and warehouse
buildings. The acquisition will be made through a “fund
structure” with one or more institutional investors, it said in
a statement to the  Singapore  exchange today, responding to media
reports it’s paying S$2.1 billion ($1.7 billion) for the assets.  Hi-P International Ltd. (HIP)  , an electronics contract-
manufacturer whose clients include BlackBerry-maker Research in
Motion Ltd., slumped 6.4 percent to 94.5 Singapore cents. The
company said it expects to post a decline in revenue and net
profit for the second quarter ended June 30 because of project
delays, higher raw material costs and increased wages.  Keppel Corp. (KEP SP), the world’s biggest builder of oil
rigs, increased 1 percent to S$11.29. The company said its
Keppel FELS Ltd. unit received an order from Asia Offshore
Drilling Ltd. to build a jack-up rig for $184 million.  Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR)  , the budget carrier
partly owned by Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA SP), plunged 11
percent to S$1.055 after  Australia  ordered the airline to
suspend its domestic flights until July 9 on safety concerns.
The country’s air safety bureau said it will decide later this
week whether to seek a court order to keep the airline grounded
for a longer period. The ban may cost the company S$2 million a
week, Tiger Air said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
