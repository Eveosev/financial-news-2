Kenya ’s shilling had the longest
streak of gains versus the dollar in three months as the central
bank’s measures to curb supply of the currency in the market
took effect.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained for a
fifth day, adding as much as 0.3 percent and trading 0.2 percent
stronger at 88.48 per dollar by 2:16 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital. It closed at 88.68 on July 1.  The Central Bank of Kenya raised its overnight lending rate
to banks on June 29 in an attempt to rein in inflationary
expectations and curb speculative trade in the shilling, which
reached the weakest in 17 years on June 22. It also blocked the
use of funds borrowed from the overnight window to trade in the
foreign-exchange market. The overnight rate, which is reviewed
daily, remained at 8 percent today, according to the Nairobi-
based bank’s website.  “The strengthening of the shilling is an indication of the
ongoing correction following the tight liquidity created by
introduction of the new overnight borrowing window by central
bank,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-based
Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today. The
shilling is expected to strengthen further and trade within the
87.50 to 88.90 range, Kendagor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
