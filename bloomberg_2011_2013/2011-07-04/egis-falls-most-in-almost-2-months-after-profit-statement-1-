Egis Nyrt., the Hungarian drugmaker
owned by Laboratoires Servier, fell the most in almost two
months after saying that changes in tax regulations will dent
earnings.  The shares dropped 3 percent to 19,115 forint by the 5 p.m.
end of trading in Budapest, the biggest slump since May 17,
while the benchmark BUX index fell 0.9 percent to 22,632.55.  “The profit warning itself might still trigger some
selloff in the shares today,” Gergely Palffy, an analyst at KBC
Securities in Budapest, wrote in a research report today.  The company’s taxes will increase by a quarterly 1.3
billion forint ($7.1 million) after changes to research and
development tax deduction rules, Egis said in a statement on the
Budapest Stock Exchange’s website after the market close July 1.  Egis expects its costs to “rise brutally” as a result of
increased taxes on pharmaceutical companies, Napi Gazdasag
reported on June 30, citing Egis Chief Financial Officer Csaba Poroszlai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
