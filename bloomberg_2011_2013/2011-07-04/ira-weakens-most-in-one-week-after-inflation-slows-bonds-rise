The lira gained against the euro-
dollar basket after the European Central Bank said the risks to
the economic recovery have intensified, sending the euro
tumbling.  The lira reversed earlier losses against the equally
weighted basket and traded 0.1 percent stronger at 2.1175 at
5:39 p.m. in Istanbul. Turkey’s currency slid 0.3 percent versus
the dollar.  The ECB left its benchmark rate at 1.5 percent and cut its
growth forecasts for this year and next. President Jean-Claude Trichet said at a news conference in Frankfurt today threats to
the euro region have worsened and inflation risks have eased.  The euro’s weakening versus the dollar “spurred euro sales
at home,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at Garanti Securities,
said in e-mailed comments. “The ECB is no longer hawkish, its
position is neutral and this is negative for the euro.”  Two-year benchmark bonds rose, with yields falling six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.81 percent, a Turk
Ekonomi Bankasi index showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
