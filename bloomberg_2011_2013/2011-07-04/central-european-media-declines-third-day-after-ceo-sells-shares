Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  fell for a third day in Czech trading after the television
broadcaster part-owned by  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  said Chief Executive
Officer Adrian Sarbu sold shares in the company.  The stock dropped 1.7 percent to 319.5 koruna at its 4:24
p.m. close in Prague, adding to a 3.4 percent slump in the
previous two sessions. Almost 132,000 shares changed hands
today, or more than twice the three-month daily average. The
 Nasdaq , its home market, is closed for a U.S. holiday today.  Sarbu sold 4,233 shares on June 30 at $20.01 apiece, the
Bermuda-registered company, known as CME, said in a regulatory
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July
1 after the Czech stock market closed.  “This number of shares represents less than 0.01 percent
of share capital, yet sales of shares by managers may always be
perceived negatively by the market,” analysts led by Milan Vanicek at J&T Banka in Prague wrote in a report today.  The operator of channels in the  Czech Republic , Romania,
Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Bulgaria tumbled to a five-month
low on the previous trading day after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended selling the shares, citing a “slow” recovery in
the company’s markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
