Japanese Foreign Minister Takeaki Matsumoto expressed his nationâ€™s concerns about tensions in the
 South China Sea  during his visit this week to Beijing.  Matsumoto met today with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping,
State Councilor Dai Bingguo and Chinese Foreign Minister  Yang Jiechi . The Japanese Foreign Minister expressed hope that
countries involved in tensions in the south China Sea will be
able to cooperate, Hidenobu Sobashima, deputy press secretary
for the Japanese foreign ministry, said at a briefing in Beijing.  Tensions have increased in the South China Sea in the past
few months as the Philippines and Vietnam have accused Chinese
ships of harassing their oil and gas survey vessels. China, the
Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand,
Brunei and Singapore have overlapping claims to various islands
and strategic shipping lanes in the area.  --Regina Tan. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
