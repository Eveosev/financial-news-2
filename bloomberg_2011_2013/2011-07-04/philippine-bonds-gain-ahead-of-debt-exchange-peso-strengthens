Philippine three-year bonds surged
the most in more than two months before the government starts a
debt exchange tomorrow. The peso rose to a seven-week high.  The yield on the securities fell to a six-month low as
central bank Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said policy makers
will assess whether they should pause monetary tightening.
Government data due tomorrow is expected to show consumer prices
rose 4.7 percent in June from a year earlier, which would be the
biggest increase since April 2009, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Yields are going down “primarily because of the bond
exchange,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist at ING Groep NV in
 Manila . “The government will lengthen its debt maturity profile.
It will also depend on how June inflation is. If it’s slower
than expected, then we will see another leg to the rally in
local-currency bond prices.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent government bond due January
2014 dropped 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 4.095
percent as of 4:18 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition
Financial Services. That’s the biggest slide since April 13.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will gauge in the coming weeks
whether it needs to raise banks’ reserve-requirement ratios or
increase borrowing costs, Guinigundo said. The central bank next
meets to review policy on July 28. It has raised its benchmark
interest rate twice this year, by a quarter of a percentage
point each time, to 4.50 percent and last month boosted lenders’
reserve ratios for the first time since 2005.  The peso climbed 0.3 percent to 43.063 per dollar in Manila,
according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 43.035, the strongest level since May 12.  The government plans to start a peso bond swap on July 5,
Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said on June 29. It will offer
new 10- and 20-year notes in exchange for shorter-maturity
securities, he said on June 21.  To contact the reporter for this story:
