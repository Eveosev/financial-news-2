Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ,
the world’s biggest generic-drug company, may have sold 14
million pounds ($22.5 million) of its generic version of  Pfizer
Inc. (PFE) ’s anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor last month, although the
patent doesn’t expire until next year, the Financial Times
reported, citing unidentified industry analysts.  Teva is estimated to have shipped up to 700,000 packets of
the medicine to the U.K. to be sold at a discount of at least 15
percent to the previous trade price, the FT said. Pfizer sought
and won a High Court injunction last week to stop further sales
of Teva’s version of the drug, the FT said.  A call to the company’s corporate communications manager,
Shir Altay-Hagoel, out of office hours went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
