The rand headed for the longest
streak of gains in a year to the dollar as the European Union
approved a payout for  Greece , easing concern about the region’s
debt crisis and raising demand for higher-yielding assets.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated for a
sixth day, adding 0.2 percent to 6.7179 per dollar as of 3:47
p.m. in Johannesburg. That’s the longest rally since the six
days through July 27, 2010. It strengthened 0.3 percent to
9.7483 per euro.  European finance ministers agreed on July 2 to disburse a
8.7 billion-euro ($12.6 billion) loan payout to Greece by mid-
July. Immediate-delivery gold added a much as 0.6 percent an
ounce and South African stocks climbed. The dollar touched a
three-week low versus the euro. The ECB on July 7 is expected to
increase its benchmark rate a quarter of a percentage point to
1.5 percent, according to all 54 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Gold, together with platinum, accounts for a fifth of
 South Africa ’s export earnings.  “Given that global risk appetite is still high and the
dollar remains under pressure, the bias is in favor of rand
strength,” Standard Bank Group Ltd. analysts including  Michael
Keenan  wrote in an e-mailed note to clients dated today.  Bonds snapped four days of declines, with the government’s
13.5 percent notes due 2015 rising 11 cents to 121.209 rand,
driving the yield down three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 7.491 percent. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021
added 22 cents to 89.119 rand, reducing the yield four basis
points to 8.406 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
