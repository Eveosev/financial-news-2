Australian retail sales unexpectedly
fell in May, the second drop in three months, as consumers cut
spending on clothes, footwear and personal accessories. The
nation’s currency fell.  Sales dropped 0.6 percent from a month earlier, when they
rose a revised 1.2 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in
Sydney today. That compares with the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists for a 0.3 percent gain.  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  Governor  Glenn Stevens  has paused
raising  interest rates  at 4.75 percent for the past six meetings
to help Queensland state recover from floods and gauge the
fallout from  Europe ’s debt crisis. A report last month showed
gross domestic product shrank in the first quarter by the most
in 20 years as floods slashed exports, even as household
spending grew and business investment surged.  “Slowing of jobs and wages growth as well as the threat of
higher rates to come has taken a toll on discretionary
spending,” Katrina Ell, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in
Sydney, said before today’s report.  The Australian dollar fell to $1.0735 as of 11:31 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0766 before the data.  Spending on clothing and footwear fell 1.8 percent, and
consumers spent 1.4 percent less at department stores, today’s
report showed. They spent 0.4 percent more at cafes and
restaurants, the only category that gained, it showed.  Weaker Sales  Myer Holdings Ltd. and  David Jones  Ltd., Australia’s
biggest department store chains, on May 11 reported declines in
quarterly sales.  Melbourne-based Myer’s sales fell 2 percent to A$657
million ($708 million) in the three months ended April 30, and
Sydney-based David Jones, the second-largest chain, posted a 1.4
percent drop in revenue to A$411.7 million in the same period.  In a  statement  after its June 7 policy decision, the RBA
said it left rates unchanged as households continue to show
caution in spending and borrowing, and a higher rate of saving
from current income.  The June 1 GDP data showed Australia’s household savings
ratio climbed to 11.5 percent in the three months through March,
from 9.7 percent in the previous quarter, the highest level
since 2009.  Australian employers added 7,800 workers in May, fewer than
economists forecast, and full-time jobs fell by 22,000 after
dropping 57,200 in April, a June 9 government report showed, the
biggest two-month decline in more than two years.  Even so, the number of unemployed Australians held at 4.9
percent in May.  Stevens’ 175 basis points of rate increases from October
2009 to November last year helped spur the nation’s currency,
which gained more than 28 percent in the past year and last
month touched the highest level since it was freely floated in
1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
