Nine Dragons Paper Holdings Ltd. (2689) , the
paper products company which had its ratings withdrawn by
Standard & Poor’s last month, agreed to borrow as much as 1
billion yuan ($155 million) from  China Development Bank  Corp.  The  term loan  consists of an 800 million yuan part and a
200 million yuan part and proceeds will be used to repay debt
and for general working capital, according to a statement to the
 Hong Kong  stock exchange today. The funds were lent by China
Development Bank’s Hong Kong branch, according to the release.  Nine Dragons’ shares slumped 17 percent on June 14, the
most in more than three years, after S&P said it withdrew its BB
long-term corporate  credit rating  because of “insufficient
access to management.” Chairwoman Zhang Yin told reporters in
Hong Kong on June 27 the company’s debt level will peak this
year.  The 1 billion yuan facility forms part of a 3.1 billion
yuan facility available to Nine Dragons and its units approved
by China Development Bank in June, according to the release. The
remaining 2.1 billion yuan will be made available for the
company’s businesses in China.  Nine Dragons has the equivalent of HK$4.3 billion in bonds
and loans maturing before the end of 2013, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company said on June 22 it would
redeem $47.6 million of bonds due 2013.  Shares in the company closed 5.5 percent higher at HK$7.14
in trade in Hong Kong today. Zhang topped a list of the world’s
20 richest self-made women according to the Hurun Rich List
2010, which was released in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
