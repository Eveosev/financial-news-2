Most Swiss stocks rose after euro-
area finance ministers approved an aid payment to Greece, while
 Standard & Poor’s  said plans for banks to roll over the nation’s
debt may constitute a “selective default.”  Lonza Group AG (LONN)  and SGS SA led gaining shares.  UBS AG (UBSN) , the
country’s biggest bank, and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-
largest, declined.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, advanced 0.1 percent to 6,245.78 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich, as twice as many shares rose as
fell. The broader Swiss Performance Index added 0.3 percent.  The SMI rallied 4 percent last week, its biggest gain in
three months. The gauge has still tumbled 7 percent since its
high this year on Feb. 18 as U.S. manufacturing and jobs reports
fueled concern that the recovery is faltering and investors
speculated that Greece will default on its debt.  The euro area approved its share of a 12 billion-euro
($17.4 billion) aid payment for Greece on July 2 and pledged to
complete work in the coming weeks on a second rescue package for
the cash-strapped nation. Finance ministers agreed to disburse
8.7 billion euros of loans under last year’s 110 billion-euro
bailout, rewarding Greek Premier  George Papandreou  for pushing a
five-year austerity package through parliament.  French Bank Rollover  The European Union has inched toward a goal of getting
banks to roll over 30 billion euros of Greek bonds. French
lenders, which own the most Greek debt, have worked out a
rollover formula.  Their proposal depends on credit-rating firms not cutting
Greece and existing or new government securities to default,
according to a draft of the plan.  Lonza, a supplier of ingredients to drug companies, climbed
3.2 percent to 67.45 Swiss francs. SGS, the world’s biggest
goods inspector, advanced 1.6 percent to 1,614 francs.  UBS slipped 0.7 percent to 15.58 francs and Credit Suisse
lost 0.4 percent to 33.40 francs. BofA Merrill Lynch Global
Research cut its 2011 and 2012 per-share earnings estimates for
the two banks.  Givaudan SA (GIVN) , the world’s biggest producer of cosmetics
chemicals, fell 0.5 percent to 900.50 francs as Citigroup Inc.
downgraded the stock to “hold” from “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
