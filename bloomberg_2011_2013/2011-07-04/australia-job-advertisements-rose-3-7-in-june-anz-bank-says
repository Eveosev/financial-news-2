Australian job advertisements gained
in June after two straight months of declines, signaling a labor
market that’s slowing as businesses limit hiring intentions, a
private report showed.  Jobs advertised in newspapers and on the Internet increased
3.7 percent from May, when they declined 6.5 percent, according
to an  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. report released
in Melbourne today. The fall in May was the steepest since March
2009.  “This disappointing result suggests the drop in
advertising in May is reflective of weaker economic conditions
in the non-mining sectors of the economy,”  Warren Hogan , chief
economist at ANZ Bank, said in a statement.  Australia’s unemployment rate likely held at 4.9 percent in
June, a government report will show on July 7, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 24 economists, even as the economy shed the
most full-time jobs in two years in April and May.  “Anecdotal evidence from ANZ’s business customers is
beginning to indicate more limited hiring intentions due to
mixed economic conditions,” Hogan said.  All 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict
 Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens will keep rates
unchanged at 4.75 percent when policy makers meet tomorrow.  National vacancies advertised in newspapers dropped by 4.9
percent in June, and Internet notices rose 4.2 percent, today’s
report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
