Gloria SA (GLORIAI1) , Peru’s largest sugar
producer, will start making ethanol at the end of the year,
Gestion reported.  Gloria will produce the fuel at its Casa Grande and
Complejo Agroindustrial Cartavio sugar mills, the Lima-based
newspaper said, citing Ari Loebl, head of the biofuels committee
at industry group National Industries Society.  Gloria,  Maple Energy Plc (MPLE)  and the Romero Group’s  Cana Brava 
plant will produce a combined 600,000 liters (158,000 gallons) a
day by December, according to Gestion.  Peruvian filling stations will have to sell gasoline mixed
with 7.8 percent of ethanol starting July 15, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
