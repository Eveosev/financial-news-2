Canada ’s dollar weakened against its
U.S. counterpart and a majority of its most-traded peers as
traders speculated a recent advance was overdone.  The currency, also known as the loonie, has strengthened
more than 3 percent since touching a three-month low on June 27.
A July 8 government report will show Canadian employers added
jobs for a third straight month in July, economists predict.  “The Canadian dollar is overbought,” said Blake Jespersen, director of foreign exchange in Toronto at Bank of
Montreal’s BMO Capital Markets unit. “It blew through major
moving averages. There’s some very modest profit taking.”  The Canadian currency slipped 0.3 percent to 96.12 cents
per  U.S. dollar  at 4:25 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.85 on July 1.
It touched 99.13 cents on June 27, the loonie’s weakest level
since March 17. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0404.  Canada’s dollar was the second-worst performer today among
16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, trailing only the
Australian dollar.  Traders trimmed holdings of riskier assets after  Standard &
Poor’s  said a debt-rollover plan for Greece may prompt a
“selective default” rating for the country.  Given the loonie is “risk-correlated, the S&P comments are
not helping,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London . “Solid domestic
data is not due until later this week.”  Canada’s economy added 15,000 jobs in June, according to
the median forecast of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
 Statistics Canada  is due to report the data on July 8 at 7 a.m.
in Ottawa.  Canada’s government bonds have returned 1.9 percent this
year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  The 10-year note’s yield fell 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage points, to 3.08 percent as the price of the 3.25
percent security maturing in June 2021 rose 35 cents to
C$101.43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
