Ecuador  business confidence last
month fell to its lowest since April after the government
announced plans to raise taxes, Deloitte & Touche LLP said.  An index measuring company confidence in Ecuador dropped to
80.1 last month from 84.5 in May out of a possible 250, the
research firm’s  Quito office  said today in a report. A year ago,
Ecuador’s business confidence stood at 91.3 points, according to
the survey.  President  Rafael Correa  renewed calls last month for higher
taxes on goods that cause health problems and environmental
damage, including automobiles, cigarettes and plastic bags,
Deloitte said.  Government spending  has outstripped revenues,
forcing Correa’s administration to seek new income to cover its
expenses, economist Walter Spurrier said.  “The government wants its tax income to cover expenses,
and in the first five months of the year these have grown at a
rhythm that’s faster than  tax revenue ,” Spurrier, director of
Guayaquil-based economic research company Grupo Spurrier, said
June 30 in an e-mailed note to clients.  Deloitte didn’t publish the number of survey participants
or report a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
