Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s largest
brokerage, said it hired Guy Douglas and Ryan Dawson for its
leveraged finance group in  London .  Douglas will join as a managing director and co-head of
capital markets for acquisition and leveraged finance reporting
to Philippe Dufournier, head of global finance, according to
Patrick Meyer, a spokesman at the Tokyo-based bank. He was most
recently head of European high-yield sales at Credit Suisse
Group AG.  Dawson will join as an executive director reporting to
Patrice Maffre and Luca Tassan, co-heads of acquisition and
leveraged franchise. Dawson spent five years at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s European leveraged finance and restructuring
unit, and has worked at UBS AG and Deutsche Bank AG.  Private equity firms have raised $26.5 billion to fund the
buyout and refinancing of companies in  Europe  this year, more
than seven times the amount for the same period of 2010,
