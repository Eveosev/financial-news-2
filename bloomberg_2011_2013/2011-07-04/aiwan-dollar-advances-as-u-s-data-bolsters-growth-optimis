Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened for a
fifth day, the longest winning streak in a month, as data
showing U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly accelerated boosted the
outlook for exports.  Government bonds  declined and stocks rose after the
Institute for Supply Management’s U.S. factory index climbed to
55.3 last month from 53.5 in May, the Tempe, Arizona-based group
said on July 1, compared with the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey for a drop to 52. A government report on July 7 may show
Taiwan’s overseas shipments increased 20 percent in June from a
year earlier after rising at the slowest pace in 19 months in
May, according to a separate survey.  “The market is in risk-taking mode today as we see the
U.S. dollar weakening on strong economic data,” said  Henry Lin ,
a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong
Commercial Bank. “Taiwan’s exports will continue to drive the
island’s economic growth.”  The  Taiwan dollar  appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$28.752
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.658 on July 1,
the strongest level since June 3. The currency may rise to
NT$28.500 this week, Lin said.  The yield on the government’s 2 percent bonds due July
2016, the most-traded  government securities , rose one basis
point to 1.16 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, increased one basis point to 0.369
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
