IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB) , the
German lender owned by  Lone Star Funds , said it hired Ina
Burghardt from Lazard Ltd. for loan syndications.  Burghardt joins as a Dusseldorf-based vice president
focusing on the syndication for leveraged and structured
corporate loans. She reports to Torten Aul, head of syndicate at
IKB, the bank said in a statement.  Burghardt spent three years in Lazard’s debt advisory and
restructuring team, IKB said.  Private equity firms have raised $26.5 billion to fund the
buyout and refinancing of companies in  Europe  this year, more
than seven times the amount for the same period of 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  IKB has arranged loans for deals including the buyout of
German outdoor clothing retailer Jack Wolfskin by Blackstone
Group LP and for the acquisition of Mondo Minerals BV by Advent
International Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
