Peru’s sol bonds held near a three-
month high on speculation the central bank will keep the
benchmark interest rate unchanged at its July 7 meeting.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 6.31
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s
price declined 0.02 centimo to 110.51 centimos per sol.  The sol traded at 2.7500 per  U.S. dollar  at today’s close,
unchanged from July 1, according to Deutsche Bank’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
