Uganda ’s shilling advanced for a
third day against the dollar as the central bank said its sales
of the U.S. currency last week to curb volatility triggered
demand for the domestic unit.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
gained 0.5 percent to 2,517.50 per dollar at 3:47 p.m. in
Kampala, the capital. It closed at 2,530 on July 1.  Bid-offer spreads on the currency narrowed to a range of 20
to 30 shillings from 50 shillings last week, indicating the
central bank’s sales of “substantial” amount of dollars last
week had worked, said Stephen Kaboyo, director of financial
markets at the Bank of Uganda.  “We are continuing to see the appreciation of the
shilling,” Kaboyo said in a phone interview today. “The players
who were holding long positions started unwinding them.”  The shilling fell to the lowest level since 1993 on June 28
following speculation that Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile
had resigned. The central bank denied the speculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
