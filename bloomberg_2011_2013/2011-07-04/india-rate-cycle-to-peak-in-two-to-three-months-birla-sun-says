Vikram Kotak, who oversees $4.2
billion as chief investment officer at Mumbai-based  Birla Sun
Life Insurance Co. , comments on the outlook for Indian stocks.
He spoke in an interview with Bloomberg UTV.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
0.3 percent to 18,820.45 at 3:12 p.m. Mumbai time. The measure
climbed 5 percent in the two-week period ended July 1.  On outlook:  “ Oil prices  have started falling and there appears to be a
slowdown in  China . Free money, which is lying in the system and
deployed in commodities, is likely to unwind and that will
reduce the pressure on oil prices.  ‘‘The Indian capital expenditure cycle is almost at the
bottom. The interest rate cycle is likely to top out in the next
two to three months. We are at the bottom of the capital
expenditure cycle and the top of the interest rate cycle, which
augurs well for equities.’’  ‘‘We expect the market to trade in a 5 to 10 percent range
for the next two to three months.’’  On preferred sectors:  ‘‘If someone has to take a one-year view on the markets,
you have to play the domestic story. Growth in India cannot be 9
percent but can be 7.5 percent, which is much stronger than the
world average or the Asia average. This number is aided mainly
by domestic consumption.’’  Kotak prefers lenders, consumer-products and capital goods
and pharmaceutical companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
