Australian  stock futures  rose and
Japan’s were little changed as European stocks advanced amid
speculation the region’s debt crisis is easing, boosting the
outlook for Asian exporters.  Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets 80 percent of its
sales overseas, and Sony Corp., an electronics maker, which gets
about a half of its sales in the U.S. and Europe, may advance in
Tokyo. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company,
may also rise in Sydney after metal prices gained.  With Europe, “people maybe had the worst-case scenario
factored in, but we didn’t quite get that,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment markets research at
Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which oversees
about $150 billion. “It’s still not exactly all over and rosy.
There’s still a long, long way to go.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,960 in Osaka, Japan, yesterday and were

to 275.54 in London yesterday as finance ministers approved an

more bailout money from the European Union and Japanese
companies said they were recovering faster than anticipated from
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.4 percent this year

day. Strategists at Nomura Holdings Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG
turned bullish on European stocks, saying it’s time to buy the
