Canadian natural gas fell for the
first day in three as cooling demand was about half of normal in
the U.S. Northwest, reducing the need for the fuel to power air-
conditioners.  Alberta  gas for August delivery decreased 5.25 cents, or
1.5 percent, to C$3.53 per gigajoule ($3.55 per million British
thermal units) as of 4:55 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. September gas fell 4.75 cents to
C$3.54. Gas traded on the exchange goes to users in  Canada  and
the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  The New York Mercantile Exchange trading floor was shut for
the July 4 holiday. In electronic trading, gas for August
delivery was 0.7 cent higher at $4.318 per million Btu at 1:15
p.m. in New York.  Cooling demand in  San Francisco  will be 5 of normal until
at least July 8, according to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster
Weather Derivatives.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  The Northwest and northern Rockies will have normal
temperatures from July 1 to July 5,  MDA EarthSat Weather  of
Gaithersburg, Maryland, said in a forecast to clients.  California Temperatures  The high in Seattle reached 74 degrees Fahrenheit (23
Celsius) today, which is normal, according to AccuWeather Inc.
of State College, Pennsylvania.  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 14.95 billion
cubic feet as of 4 p.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.58 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.79 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.03 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.87 billion cubic feet today, about 65
percent of its capacity of 2.9 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
gained 1.68 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $4.3515 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange  on July 1. Alliance is an express
line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest
from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 0.13 cents to $4.0959.  To contact the reporter on this story:
