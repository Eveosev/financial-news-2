Many teachers in  Zimbabwe  are on
strike and may be joined by other state employees after the
government offered a “paltry” wage increase, the  Daily News 
said, citing Raymond Majongwe, the secretary general of the
Progressive Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe.  The wages of the lowest-paid government employees rose to
$159 a month from $128, or to $243 including allowances from
$180, the Harare-based Daily News said on its website.  The increase was negotiated by the Apex Council, which
includes the government and some unions representing state
employees, though not the Progressive Teachers’ Union, the Daily
News said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
