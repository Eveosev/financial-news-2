Philip Wee , a senior currency
economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, comments on
the outlook for the Thai baht in an interview today.  The baht advanced 1.1 percent, the most since February 2008,
to 30.46 per dollar as of 1:34 p.m. in Bangkok, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, after a party led by exiled premier
Thaksin Shinawatra’s sister was forecast to win a clear majority
in elections held over the weekend.  DBS predicts the currency will strengthen 5.8 percent to
28.80 per dollar by year-end and 8.8 percent to 28.00 in 12
months.  “I think the Thai elections have proceeded better than
what most people had hoped, and they may be the first step to a
politically more stable  Thailand .  “ Thailand manages its  exchange rate  in line with its
regional partners. The  Thai baht  should benefit from the
region’s growth engine.  “Asia is still on a tightening mode on inflation. As long
as the growth outlook can overcome global uncertainties,
including Greece’s debt crisis and Japan’s crisis, the market
will see an upward trend.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
