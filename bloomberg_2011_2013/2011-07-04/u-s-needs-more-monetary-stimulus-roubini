The  U.S. economy  needs more fiscal
stimulus in the short term because the economy remains weak,
followed by measures to “deal with fiscal problems or you’re
going to have a fiscal train wreck,”  Nouriel Roubini  said.    “The right solution would be to commit to a program of
trying to control spending and raised taxes gradually over the
next five years,” Roubini, co-founder of Roubini Global
Economics, said in an interview with Bloomberg Haberturk
television on the sidelines of the Aspen Ideas Festival in
Aspen,  Colorado .             “The trouble is we’re doing short-term drag rather than
stimulus and we’re not committing to anything in the medium
term, so the policy in the U.S. is not optimal,” he said.  The  Federal Reserve  may be pushed by weaker-than-expected
or stalled growth to do something that’s not yet priced into the
market, Roubini said. “This is QE3 after QE2. It’s not going to
make a huge difference, but you need more monetary stimulus,”
he said.   The economy is likely to be weak and fiscal issues will
continue to drag down the economy, meaning “you’ll have zero
rates for as far as the eye can see,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
