Karim Wade, the son of the Senegalese
President Abdoulaye Wade, rejected all claims that he wants to
inherit the presidency from his father.  “Such a project has not, and never will be, the intention
of the President of the Republic or me,” Karim Wade he said in
an open letter published in the Dakar-based le Soleil newspaper
today.  On June 23, President Wade retracted a proposal to change
the constitution to allow a running mate for the February 2012
elections who would assume the role in the event of the
President’s death.  To contact the reporter on this story:
