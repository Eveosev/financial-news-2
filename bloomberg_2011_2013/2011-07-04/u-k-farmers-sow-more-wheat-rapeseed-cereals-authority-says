U.K. farmers planted more wheat and
rapeseed for harvesting this year in response to “strong”
prices at the time of sowing, the country’s Home-Grown Cereals
Authority said.  The wheat area in the U.K. climbed 0.7 percent to 1.94
million hectares (4.8 million acres) from 1.93 million in 2010,
the HGCA said in an e-mailed report today based on a survey of
about 4,000 farmers.  Feed wheat traded in  London  rose 87 percent last year to
199 pounds ($320) a metric ton at the end of December, while
Paris-traded rapeseed traded at 497.25 euros ($721) a ton on
Dec. 31 following a 73 percent gain last year. Feed wheat has
slipped 12 percent this year and rapeseed declined 20 percent.  Rapeseed planting rose 8.6 percent to 696,000 hectares and
the barley area gained 2.3 percent to 915,000 hectares, the HGCA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
