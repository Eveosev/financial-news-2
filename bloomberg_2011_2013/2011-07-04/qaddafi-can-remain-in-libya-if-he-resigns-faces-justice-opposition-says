Muammar Qaddafi  will not be able to
stay in  Libya , said the head of the National Transitional
Council of the rebels, who are trying to end Qaddafi’s more than
four decades of rule over the North African nation.  “There is absolutely no current or future possibility for
Qaddafi to remain in Libya,” council head Mustafa Abdul Jalil
said in an e-mailed statement. “There is no escape clause for
Qaddafi - he must be removed from power and face justice.”  Jalal el-Gallal, a spokesman for the council, had
separately said that the rebels would tolerate the presence of
Qaddafi in Libya were the leader to resign and face prosecution.  The  International Criminal Court  issued arrest warrants on
June 27 for Qaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam Qaddafi and military
intelligence chief Abdullah al Senussi on suspicion of murder
and persecution. Qaddafi warned  Europe  on July 1 that further
attacks on Libya would prompt retaliation and told supporters
in the capital Tripoli to “get ready to end the fight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
