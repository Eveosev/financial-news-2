Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir
said today his government would support the new state of
 Southern Sudan  when it’s declared independent next week, state-
run  SUNA news agency  reported.  Relations between the north and the south will be peaceful
and outstanding issues can be resolved, the Khartoum-based
agency said today, citing al-Bashir.  Clashes between Sudanese government forces and units of
Southern Sudan’s army in Southern Kordofan, northern Sudan’s
only oil-producing state, have led more than 73,000 people to
flee their homes since June 5, according to the  United Nations .
The fighting there and in the disputed border region of Abyei
raised concern of a resumption of a two-decade civil war that
ended in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
