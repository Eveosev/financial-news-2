Hungary’s welfare spending cuts and
tax changes hurt the poorest and most vulnerable, which may lead
to social tension and make their implementation more difficult,
 Hirszerzo  reported, citing Iryna Ivaschenko, the  International
Monetary Fund ’s representative in Budapest.  “While we completely support the aim of increasing the
activity rate, some policies such as cuts in welfare spending
and  tax reform  will affect the lowest earners,” Ivaschenko
said, according to a  transcript of the interview  posted on
Hirszerzo’s website. “This could create social tension, which
makes the program’s implementation more difficult, since if
there are social tensions, planned policy steps may need to be
altered.”  Hungary’s spending-cut plans represent a “180-degree
turnaround” from Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s initial policies
when he assumed power last year, Ivaschenko said, according to
the Hirszerzo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
