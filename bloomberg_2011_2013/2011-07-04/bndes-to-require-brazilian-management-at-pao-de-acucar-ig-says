Brazil ’s state development bank,
BNDES, will require a guarantee that a proposed new company
including  Carrefour SA (CA) ’s local assets will have Brazilian
management, Guilherme Barros, a columnist at IG news service,
reported, without saying where he obtained the information.  The merger of Carrefour assets with Sao Paulo-based
retailer Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar
would include an accord that blocks any sale of control of the
new company to the French retailer, the columnist for the
Brazilian news service wrote.  BNDES aims to prevent contracts such as the 2006
shareholders agreement that gives French retailer  Casino
Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO)  the option to buy control of Pao de Acucar
next year, according to Barros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
