Fast Retailing Co.’s sales of Uniqlo
brand casual clothes in  Japan  rose last month as the government-
led “Super Cool Biz” campaign helped draw customers to Asia’s
biggest apparel chain.  Sales jumped 3.9 percent in June overall from 12 months
earlier and 3.5 percent per customer at stores open at least a
year, the Yamaguchi, Japan-based company said in a statement
today.  Fast Retailing is benefiting from efforts in Japan to cut
office air conditioning use by encouraging employees to wear
cooler casual clothes. Hotter weather last month helped boost
demand for  Uniqlo ’s Silky Dry and Sarafine underwear that the
company says help wick away sweat.  Fast Retailing rose 2.5 percent to 13,000 yen at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo  trading, before the company announced its sales.
The stock has risen 0.5 percent this year, compared with a 2.6
percent decline in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average.  The government started a mandatory power-saving drive on
July 1 for the first time in more than three decades, as the
country’s strongest earthquake and tsunami on record in March
damaged power plants and cut the supply of electricity.  The temperature in Kumagaya City, north of Tokyo, rose to
39.8 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on June 24, the
highest on record for the month, according to the  Japan
Meteorological Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
