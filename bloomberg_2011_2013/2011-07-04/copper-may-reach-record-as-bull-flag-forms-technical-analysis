Copper’s climb above a Fibonacci
level last week is helping it form a so-called bull-flag pattern
which may push prices up as much as 7.5 percent toward a record
by October, according to  technical analysis  by  Barclays Capital .  The attached chart shows copper may rise to $9,610 a metric
ton after climbing above $9,400, near a 61.8 percent retracement
of the April to May decline, one of the levels singled out in
so-called Fibonacci analysis. Reaching $9,610 will confirm the
bull flag and is near a “key” level of the metal’s downtrend
since February, according to Barclays. Copper peaked at $10,190
in February.  “The fact that it’s gone through $9,400 makes us slightly
more bullish, said Lynnden Branigan, an analyst at Barclays
Capital in London. “$9,600 is key because it’s breaking
that downtrend since February. We need the flag to be triggered,
otherwise range conditions persist.”  A bull flag is a succession of lower highs and lower lows
after an uptrend and the trigger to a new uptrend is when prices
close above the falling trend line that is drawn off the peaks,
Branigan said. Copper rebounded 12 percent since falling from
February’s all-time high to this year’s low of $8,504.50 seven
weeks ago. The metal traded at $9,480 a ton by 5:39 p.m.
yesterday on the  London  Metal Exchange and is down 1.3 percent
this year.  Copper may approach $10,190 by September or October,
Branigan said.  Prices tripled since the end of 2008 as mining companies
failed to keep pace with demand, creating shortages for a second
consecutive year, according to Barclays. Copper will average
$10,500 this quarter and $12,000 in the fourth quarter, as
demand outpaces supply by 728,000 tons this year, the bank says.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
