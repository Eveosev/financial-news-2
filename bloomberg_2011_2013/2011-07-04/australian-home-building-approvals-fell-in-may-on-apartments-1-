Australian home-building approvals
declined in May for a second straight month as employment growth
weakened in an economy recovering from the nation’s most
expensive natural disasters.  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments fell 7.9 percent from April, when they dropped a
revised 0.3 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney
today. The median forecast was for a 0.5 percent decline in a
Bloomberg News survey of 23 economists.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  has paused
raising  interest rates  at 4.75 percent for the past six meetings
to help Queensland state recover from floods and gauge the
fallout from  Europe ’s debt crisis. A report last month showed
gross domestic product shrank in the first quarter by the most
in 20 years as floods slashed exports, even as household
spending grew and business investment surged.  “Housing market sentiment continues to soften and weaker
house prices weigh down dwelling construction plans,” David
Cannington, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., wrote in a report before today’s data.  Building approvals fell 14.4 percent from a year earlier,
the report showed. That compares with economists’ forecast for a
5.6 percent drop year-over-year.  Approvals to build private houses rose 0.7 percent to 7,814
in May from the previous month, the report showed. Approvals for
apartments and renovations declined 20.1 percent to 4,276.  To contact the reporter on this story:
