The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2 basis points to
107 basis points as of 9:59 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1.5 basis points to 108.5 as of
7:58 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. prices.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 1 basis point to
126.5 as of 9:36 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
