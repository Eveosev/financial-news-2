Overseas funds bought a net 26.8
billion rupees ($600.5 million) of Indian stocks on June 30 and
July 1, raising total investment in equities this year to 53.5
billion rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 80 billion rupees of shares and sold 53.3
billion rupees over the two days, the  Securities and Exchange
Board of India  said  today . They sold a net 20.8 billion rupees
of bonds in the period, paring inflows into debt this year to
120.3 billion rupees.  Overseas investors bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. They invested 464
billion rupees in bonds last year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.525 trillion rupees in equities and 907 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
