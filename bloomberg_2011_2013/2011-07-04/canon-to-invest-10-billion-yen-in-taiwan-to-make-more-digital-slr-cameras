Canon Inc. (7751)  will build a new factory
and expand another in Taiwan to make more cameras with
interchangeable lenses, the fastest growing segment of digital-
imaging devices.  Canon, the world’s biggest camera maker, will spend about
10 billion yen ($124 million) on the expansion, Takafumi Hongo,
a company spokesman, said in a telephone interview. Canon
forecasts sales of about 7 million single-lens reflex cameras
this year, compared with sales of 5.9 million last year, he
said.  Shipments of SLR cameras  jumped  30 percent last year, more
than double the 13 percent gain by compact models, according to
the Camera & Imaging Products Association, a Tokyo-based
industry group. Canon had the biggest share of the market, with
44.5 percent, research company IDC said in April.  The Nikkei reported Canon’s plan to build the  Taiwan 
factory earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
