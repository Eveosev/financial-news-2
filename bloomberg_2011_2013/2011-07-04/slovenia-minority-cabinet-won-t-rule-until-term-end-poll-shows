Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor’s minority government probably won’t complete its term in
office, which ends in the second half of 2012, a poll showed.  Some 64 percent of those surveyed said the government,
which has 33 lawmakers in the 90-member parliament, won’t last
until the end of its term, with 27 percent saying it will,
according  Delo newspaper , which today published a poll by its
Delo Stik company. The survey of 402 adults was carried out from
June 27 to June 30. No margin of error was given.  Also, 52 percent of those polled said they expect early
elections in September or October, while 32 percent said the
ballot will take place in the second half of next year,
according to the poll.  Pahor’s administration, which is struggling to boost the
economic recovery and cut the  budget deficit , was abandoned by
two coalition partners in the last three months. Desus, the
pensioners’ party, left the ruling group in May because of its
opposition to the pension overhaul. Zares party quit last month
over a number of issues including early elections.  The largest opposition group, the Slovenian Democratic
Party led by former Premier Janez Jansa, has been pushing for an
early vote since June 5, when Slovenians in a referendum
rejected the pension changes that would extend the  retirement
age  to 65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
