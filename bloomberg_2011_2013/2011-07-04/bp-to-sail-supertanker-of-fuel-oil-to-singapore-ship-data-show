BP Plc will load a supertanker
tomorrow bound for Singapore in the first  fuel-oil  shipment this
month from  Europe  to Asia’s biggest oil-trading and storage
center, shipping fixtures and data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Evgenia 1, a Malta-flagged very large crude carrier,
will sail this week from Rotterdam for $3.35 million, based on a
report from Optima Shipbrokers Ltd. The vessel arrived in port
today and will carry fuel oil, Bloomberg data showed. A VLCC can
take on about 2 million barrels of crude or fuel oil, a refining
by-product used to power ships or generate electricity.  Fuel-oil inventories in the European storage hub of
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp rose 6 percent in the week ended
June 30 to 748,000 metric tons, according to PJK International
BV. That’s about 4.82 million barrels. Stockpiles of residual
fuels in  Singapore  fell 0.7 percent to 20.6 million barrels in
the week to June 29, trade ministry data showed.  Robert Wine , a London-based spokesman at BP, Europe’s
second-largest oil company, declined to comment on trading
operations.  At least three supertankers were chartered to carry fuel
oil from Europe to Singapore in June, according to shipping
fixtures and Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
