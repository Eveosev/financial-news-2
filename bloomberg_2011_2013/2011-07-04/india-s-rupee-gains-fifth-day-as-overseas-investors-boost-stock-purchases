India ’s rupee rose for a fifth day,
its longest run of gains in almost a month, as overseas
investors stepped up purchases of the country’s assets to take
advantage of growth in  Asia ’s third-biggest economy.  The currency appreciated to the strongest level in two
months today as global funds bought $734 million more Indian
stocks than they sold last month through June 29, according to
exchange data. India’s $1.3 trillion economy expanded 7.8
percent in the first quarter of 2011 from a year earlier,
compared with 8.3 percent in the previous three months,
government data showed.  “Capital inflows into stocks indicate the outlook for
 India’s economy ,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a Mumbai-based
currency trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. “Equities have
rebounded.”  The rupee appreciated 0.4 percent to 44.4275 per dollar at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 44.4575 earlier, the strongest
level since May 3.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.97 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.11
at the end of last week. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
