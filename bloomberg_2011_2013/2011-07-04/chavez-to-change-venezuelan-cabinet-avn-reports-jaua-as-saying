Venezuelan Vice President Elias Jaua
said that President  Hugo Chavez  will organize his cabinet “for
the new stage” as he recovers from an operation to remove a
cancerous tumor,  Agencia Venezolana de Noticias  reported.  Chavez, who is capable of running the government, should
hold a cabinet meeting Tuesday or Wednesday, state-run AVN
reported, citing Jaua.  To contact the reporter on this story:
