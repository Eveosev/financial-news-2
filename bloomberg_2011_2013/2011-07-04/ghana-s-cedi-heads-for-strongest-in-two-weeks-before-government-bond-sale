Ghana ’s cedi headed for the strongest
close in two weeks against the dollar as foreign-based investors
transferred funds to local banks before a sale of five-year
bonds.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
appreciated 0.2 percent to 1.5150 per dollar as of 1:15 p.m. in
Accra, the capital. A close at this level would be the strongest
since June 20.  “We have had some dollar inflows since the auction was
announced on Thursday,” Chris Nettey, a currency trader at
Stanbic Bank Ghana Ltd., said in a telephone interview today.
“Any major move in the cedi should be on the strengthening
note.”  The  Bank of Ghana  will sell  300 million cedis  ($198
million) of notes maturing in 2016, Adams Nyinaku, head of
treasury at the bank, said on June 28. The sale will take place
on July 28, the bank said in a prospectus published on its
website June 30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
