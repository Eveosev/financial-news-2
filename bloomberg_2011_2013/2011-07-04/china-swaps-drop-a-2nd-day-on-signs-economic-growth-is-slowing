China ’s interest-rate swaps dropped
the most in a week on speculation slowing economic growth will
prompt policy makers to moderate monetary tightening measures.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index, a gauge of manufacturing in
the country, decreased to 50.9 in June, from 52 in May, the
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing reported July 1.
The seven-day repurchase rate fell for a second day after the
central bank added 586 billion yuan ($90.7 billion) to the
banking system in the past seven weeks.  “The decline in the PMI spurred worries about an economic
slowdown,” said Liu Linan, an interest-rate strategist at
Deutsche Bank AG in  Hong Kong . “The improved liquidity has led
to a decline in swap rates. Around the end of this week, the
seven-day repo rate may return to a normal level of between 3
percent and 3.5 percent.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, slipped four basis
points to 3.79 percent as of 4:44 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate may drop to 3.75 percent by
the end of the week, said Liu.  The repurchase rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, declined 109 basis points, or 1.09 percentage
points, to 4.80 percent, according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  A total of 142 billion yuan of central bank bills and
 repurchase agreements  will mature this week, compared with 132
billion yuan last week, according to Liu Junyu, a bond analyst
in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-
largest lender.  The yield on the 2.77 percent government bond due May 2012
fell six basis points to 3.33 percent, according to quotes
provided by the Interbank Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
