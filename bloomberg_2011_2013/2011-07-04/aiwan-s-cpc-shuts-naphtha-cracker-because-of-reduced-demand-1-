CPC Corp. shut a naphtha cracker at
Kaohsiung,  Taiwan , because of reduced ethylene demand from
customers who are experiencing output disruptions.  The state-owned refiner’s No. 4 naphtha cracker will be
closed until July 15 from today, Chen Ming-huei, a company
spokesman, said via telephone from Taipei. The company’s
ethylene storage tanks are full because customers including
Formosa Plastics Corp. have reduced purchases, he said.  The cracker processes naphtha into ethylene, a material
used to make plastics, chemicals and fabrics. CPC operates three
such processing plants with a combined annual ethylene output
capacity of 1.1 million metric tons, including 385,000 tons from
unit No. 4. Two other crackers are no longer in service.  The Yunlin county government asked the Formosa Plastics
Group to halt production at some of its plants following a fire
in May at its Mailiao complex in southern Taiwan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
