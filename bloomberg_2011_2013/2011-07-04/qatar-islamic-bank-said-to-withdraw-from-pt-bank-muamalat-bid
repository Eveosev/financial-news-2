Qatar Islamic Bank (QIBK)  has withdrawn as a
bidder for PT Bank Muamalat  Indonesia , a person involved in the
deal said.  Qatar Islamic no longer seeks to buy a stake in Indonesia’s
oldest Islamic lender, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the matter is private. A spokesman for Qatar
Islamic Bank wasn’t able to comment immediately.  Qatar Islamic along with PT Bank Permata, which is 45
percent owned by Standard Chartered Plc, and Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp had sought a controlling stake in Bank Muamalat,
people familiar with the matter said last month.  Shareholders of closely-held Bank Muamalat planned to sell
more than 50 percent of the lender in a deal worth as much as
$600 million, one person said.  “Bank Muamalat’s management is not aware of recent
developments with regards to any planned sale by shareholders,”
PT Bank Muamalat’s Corporate Secretary Meitra Sari said in an
interview today. “Thus far the information is entirely within
the hands of the shareholders and Bank Muamalat’s management
will support any decision made.”  Reuters reported that Qatar Islamic Bank withdrew from
plans to buy a stake in Bank Muamalat earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
