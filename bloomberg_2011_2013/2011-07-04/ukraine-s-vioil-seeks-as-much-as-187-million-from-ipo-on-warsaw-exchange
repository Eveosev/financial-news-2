ViOil Holding SA, a Ukrainian
sunflower-oil producer, is seeking to raise between 390 million
and 507 million zloty ($144 million to $187 million) in an
initial public offering in Warsaw this month.  The company, which has 4 percent of the world market for
sunflower oil, set a price range of 15 to 19.5 zloty and aims to
sell 26 million new shares and 5.9 million existing shares, it
said on its  website  today. It expects to have a free float of 28
percent to 37 percent after the share-listing, planned for July
29. The final price will be set on July 13.  The cash raised will finance investment in oilseeds, as
well as storage and processing facilities.  ViOil, which is following six other Ukrainian companies
that have listed in Warsaw since November, hired Credit Suisse
Securities ( Europe ), Concorde Ltd. and the brokerage of BRE Bank
SA to carry out the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
