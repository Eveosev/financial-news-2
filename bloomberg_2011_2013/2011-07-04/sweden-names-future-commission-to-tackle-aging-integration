Sweden will appoint a “future
commission” to study how to tackle challenges from an aging
population, the integration of immigrants, social inequality and
environmental issues.  The group will be led by Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt
and consist of the government’s other three party heads as well
as independent experts, the government leaders  wrote today  in an
opinion article in Stockholm-based Dagens Nyheter. It will
finish its deliberations at the latest on March 1, 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
