Rainfall in the Ukraine has reduced
the amount of land from which grains can be harvested by 5 to 8
percent, according to the Hydrometeorological Center.  Ukraine has 15.5 million hectares (38.3 million acres)
planted with spring and winter grains for the 2011 harvest,
according to state statistics committee data.  The reduction due to rain is within the average loss that
grain fields have in the summer, Mykola Kulbida, the head of the
center, told reporters in Kiev today.  There has been excessive soil humidity, which damages
plants, in Ukraine’s northern, central and southern regions,
Kulbida said.  Rains, which started on June 25, are expected to last
through July 6 and will be back by the end of the month,
according to the center. August is expected to be a drier month
than July, Kulbida said.  The grain harvest is forecast to rise by 15.4 percent to 45
million metric tons this year, the Ukrainian Agriculture
Ministry said on July 1. The wheat harvest is expected to rise
by 13.7 percent to 19.1 million tons and barley to decline by
3.2 percent to 8.2 million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
