Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , a Kazakh copper miner,
will only buy companies with “huge” production potential to
make the rising cost of acquisitions worthwhile, said Eduard Ogay, an executive director at the company.  “Kazakhmys is looking at possible acquisitions but all
companies value themselves at pretty high prices,” Ogay said in
an interview in Astana, Kazakhstan. “If Kazakhmys would buy a
company it must have huge plans for production.”  Kazakhmys, based in  London , is seeking to increase annual
copper output by two-thirds to 500,000 metric tons in 2015 to
meet rising demand for the metal from Asia.  It holds a 26 percent stake in ferroalloy producer Eurasian
Natural Resources Corp. and is open to any “commercial offer”
for the holding, Chief Executive Officer Oleg Novachuk said in
 Hong Kong  on June 28. The stake is valued at about $4.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
