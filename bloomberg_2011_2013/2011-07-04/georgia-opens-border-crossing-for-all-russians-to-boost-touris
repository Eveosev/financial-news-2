Georgia  opened the Larsi border
crossing to travelers from throughout Russia to boost tourism
and improve relations between the two countries that fought a
five-day war in 2008.  Georgia opened the crossing for visa-free travel by
citizens of the neighboring North Caucasus Federal District last
year. Beginning this month, residents of other Russian regions
can cross into Georgia at Larsi, obtaining visas upon arrival,
Deputy Foreign Minister  Tornike Gordadze  said today by phone.  “Georgia wants to show that it is a civilized and free
country and we welcome everyone here,” Alexander Rondeli, head
of the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International
Studies said on the phone today.  Georgia broke off diplomatic relations with  Russia  in
September 2008, shortly after the two countries fought a five-
day war over the separatist region of  South Ossetia . Russia cut
all transport links with Georgia in October 2006 after Georgia
arrested four Russian servicemen on suspicion of espionage.  Airzena Georgian Airways, Georgia’s national airline,
previously resumed direct flights between Tbilisi and Moscow. It
started weekly direct flights between Moscow and the port city
of Batumi last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
