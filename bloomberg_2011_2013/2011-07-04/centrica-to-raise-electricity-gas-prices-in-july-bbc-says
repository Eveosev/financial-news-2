Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.â€™s biggest
energy supplier, may raise gas and electricity prices before
July 28, the  British Broadcasting Corp.  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The company may increase gas tariffs from 15 percent to 17
percent, the  BBC  said on its website. Scottish Power boosted gas
prices 19 percent and 10 percent for electricity last month, the
report said.  Centrica spokesman Julian Mears declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
