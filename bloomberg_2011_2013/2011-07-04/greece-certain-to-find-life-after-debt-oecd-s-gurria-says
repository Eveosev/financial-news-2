Greece  will overcome its fiscal
problems and find that “there’s life after debt,” said  Angel Gurria , secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.  Gurria, a former Mexican finance minister, said Greece
faces problems similar to those once tackled by his own nation.  “ Mexico  never defaulted, but they negotiated with their
own creditors a voluntary arrangement,” Gurria said today in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in Rome. “After a few
years, we moved along to other, more definitive solutions. In
the end, I can tell you: there’s life after debt.”  One year after the 110 billion-euro ($160 billion) bailout
that aimed to end the region’s debt crisis, Greece is in danger
of defaulting without a new rescue package. Some European
countries, led by  Germany , have pushed for private investors to
shoulder some of the burden of a new aid plan and are seeking
commitments from banks and insurers to roll over 30 billion
euros of bonds into longer-maturity debt to ease the country’s
financing needs.  The final solution for the Greek debt crisis will have to
involve private creditors, Gurria said.  “Every day there is a new plan, there are so many plans,”
he said. “We’re not very well coordinated in explaining and
speaking. We should speak with a sole voice. I think we are
still not there. I think the ultimate solution will have to
involve creditors.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
