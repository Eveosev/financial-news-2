Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  appointed
five new partners in Australia and named Simon Rothery as the
unit’s sole chief executive officer after the New York-based
parent completed the takeover of the business.  Rothery, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1998, and the co-heads
of  investment banking , James McMurdo and Christian Johnston,
become partners, according to an internal memo sent to Bloomberg
News today. Andrew Rennie, head of equities, and Anthony Miller
from the financing group were also appointed.  The purchase of the remaining 55 percent of the unit last
week means Goldman Sachs now owns all its Asian operations
except the division in China. The offer valued the whole
business at between A$800 million ($859 million) and A$1.2
billion, according to the Australian Financial Review. The Wall
Street firm didn’t disclose the value of the deal.  Stephen Fitzgerald, a member of Goldman Sachs’ Asia
management committee and formerly co-CEO in  Australia  with
Rothery, becomes chairman and advisory director of the business,
according to the memo.  To contact the reporter for this story:
