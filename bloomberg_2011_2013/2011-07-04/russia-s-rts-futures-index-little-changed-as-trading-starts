Russia ’s RTS stock-index futures
expiring in September were little changed at 11:01 a.m. in  New
York .  Contracts on OAO Lukoil, the country’s second-biggest oil
company, fell 0.1 percent. Contracts on OAO Gazprom, the natural
gas export monopoly, and agreements on OAO Sberbank, Russia’s
biggest lender, were little changed.  U.S. equity markets are closed today for public holidays.  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
