Iceland’s  Financial Supervisory
Authority  has imposed rules that limit the amount paid in
bonuses to employees of financial institutions in the north
Atlantic island.  The rules stipulate how banks and other regulated lenders
can operate an incentive system for its employees, limiting the
amount of bonuses to 25 percent of annual pay, the FSA said in a
 statement  on its website. The rules prohibit bonus payments that
don’t take account of performance.  “Part of the bonus payment shall be deferred for a minimum
of three years,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
