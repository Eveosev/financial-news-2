Spain  and  Italy  run a “significant
risk” of losing market access if they don’t implement austerity
measures,  Nouriel Roubini , co-founder of Roubini Global
Economics LLC, told Bloomberg Haberturk television.  “Regardless of what happens in Greece, these countries
must do the right thing or they’ll lose market access,” Roubini
said in an interview at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Aspen,
Colorado.  Spain is “too big to fail” and “too big to be bailed
out,” he said, and the  European Central Bank  is making a
mistake by raising interest rates too much, too soon, he said.  High interest rates will make the Euro stronger, growth
worse, competitiveness worse and will create more fiscal costs
and banking problems, Roubini said.  “Most of the Eurozone is still contracting like the
periphery,” while global growth in the second half of the year
will be so weak it will “feel like recession,” Roubini added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
