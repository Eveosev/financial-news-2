Ethiopian security forces detained
two Swedish journalists for illegally entering the country after
a raid on a rebel group in the eastern Somali region that killed
15, State Minister of Communications Shimeles Kemal said.  The fighting took place after members of the Ogaden
National Liberation Front crossed the border from Somalia on
June 27, Shimeles said in a phone interview from the  Addis
Ababa , the capital.  “It was a failed attempt to infiltrate from Somalia on the
part of the ONLF,” he said today. “The rebels started shooting
and in the ensuing fight 15 were killed and six captured,
together with the Swedish journalists.”  The pair were treated for slight injuries and are being
held by police in the regional capital, Jijiga, Shimeles said.
The Swedish Foreign Ministry is waiting for official
confirmation of the arrests, spokesman Kent Oberg said in a
phone interview from  Stockholm  today.  Ethiopian security forces were tipped off by officials in
Puntland, a semi-autonomous region of Somalia, about the entry
of the journalists, the ONLF said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The group has been fighting for self-determination
for the Ogaden area of Somali region since 1984.  To contact the reporter on this story:
