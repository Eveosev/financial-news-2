Former Ukrainian Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko ’s abuse-of-power trial was adjourned for two days
after the politician complained that her lawyer was out of the
country gathering evidence for her defense.  Tymoshenko had asked the Central Kiev District Court for a
one week delay because a second attorney, Mykola Tytarenko,
didn’t have the right to read court documents in the case until
June 30 and could not provide an adequate defense today. Judge
Rodion Kireyev said a two-day delay would give Tytarenko
adequate time to prepare.  “Tytarenko will have to read 4,000 pages tomorrow,”
Tymoshenko told journalists after today’s hearing. “Is this
justice?”  Prosecutors opened a criminal case against Tymoshenko in
April, alleging that her government agreed to pay too much to
buy Russian natural gas in 2009, resulting in 1.5 billion
hryvnia ($188 million) of damage to Ukraine. The former premier
accused President  Viktor Yanukovych  of engineering the case to
silence opposition before next year’s parliamentary elections.  Tymoshenko has been at odds with Yanukovych since 2004,
when she helped lead the Orange Revolution that overturned his
victory in presidential elections. She was ordered not to leave
Ukraine in December after a separate investigation into the sale
of emissions permits to  Japan  in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
