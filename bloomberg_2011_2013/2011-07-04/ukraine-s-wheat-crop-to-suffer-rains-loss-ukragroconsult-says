Ukraine’s wheat harvest will probably
be between 19.8 million and 20 million metric tons in 2011 after
rains in June damaged plants, Kiev-based researcher
UkrAgroConsult said, lowering a previous forecast for 20.4
million tons.  The researcher will also reduce its barley crop forecast of
8.55 million tons by the end of the week, Liza Malyshko, an
analyst at Kiev-based UkrAgroConsult, said by phone today.  Rainfall in June “endangered” grain quality and high
humidity caused fungus outbreaks, the researcher said. The
proportion of the wheat crop of milling standard may decline,
UkrAgroConsult added.  Deputy Agriculture Minister Mykola Bezuhlyi expects about
60 percent of Ukraine’s wheat to be of milling quality, he said
June 22.  Corn and other late spring grains haven’t been damaged by
rains and their production may be higher than expected
previously, the researcher said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
