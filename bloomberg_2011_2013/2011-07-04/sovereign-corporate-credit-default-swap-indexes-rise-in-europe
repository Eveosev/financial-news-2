The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments climbed 3 basis points to 221 at 12 p.m. in London.
An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  Swaps on  Greece  climbed 14 basis points to 1,875, according
to CMA. Contracts on  Spain  jumped 6 basis points to 263,
 Portugal  increased 5 to 755 and Ireland rose 4.5 to 732.5, while
Italy was 4 higher at 182 and Belgium was up 3 at 146.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose from a four
week low, increasing 3 basis points to 387, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1 basis point to 104.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 4.5 basis points to 155 and
the subordinated index climbed 7.5 to 279.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
