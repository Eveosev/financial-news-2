Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  rose the most in
three months in  Hong Kong  trading, leading gains among Macau
casino operators after the city said gambling revenue had the
steepest gain this year last month.  Wynn Macau , the city’s second-largest casino company by
market value, jumped 7.3 percent to HK$27.20 at the 4 p.m. close
of trading in Hong Kong, the biggest gain since April 4 on a
closing basis.  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  advanced 4 percent to HK$19.16,
MGM China Holdings Ltd. rose 5.3 percent and  Sands China Ltd. (1928) ,
the largest Macau casino operator by market value, added 4.3
percent.  The city’s casinos are benefiting from improvements in rail
and air infrastructure and from the lack of casinos in northern
 China , Teng Yee Tan, a Hong Kong-based equity analyst at CIMB-GK
Securities HK Ltd., wrote in a note to clients today. He raised
his rating on Wynn Macau to “trading buy” from “neutral.”  Casino revenue in Macau rose 52.4 percent to 20.8 billion
patacas ($2.6 billion) in June from a year earlier, the city’s
Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau said July 1.  A “trading buy” rating means the company’s stock is
expected to post total returns of 15 percent or more in the next
three months, according to Tan’s report.  Shares of  Melco International Development Ltd. (200)  rose 5.6
percent, and  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  jumped 5.2 percent.
The  Hang Seng Index  closed with a 1.66 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
