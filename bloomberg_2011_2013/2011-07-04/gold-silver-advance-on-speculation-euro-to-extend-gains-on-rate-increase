Gold gained for the first time in
three days in London as some investors bought the metal after
its drop to a six-week low and as a weaker dollar spurred demand
for an alternative asset.  The dollar was little changed after earlier today touching
a three-week low versus the euro on speculation the  European
Central Bank  will raise  interest rates  this week. European
finance ministers on July 2 authorized an 8.7 billion-euro
($12.6 billion) loan payout to Greece by mid-July after the
nation’s parliament passed austerity measures.  “The precious metal has benefited from a mix of bargain
hunting and stronger euro,” said  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London, in a report. “Trade today is
likely to be relatively thin and choppy due to the U.S.
holiday.”  Immediate-delivery gold gained $8.12, or 0.6 percent, to
$1,495.90 an ounce by 5:33 p.m. in London. The metal dropped to
$1,478.83 on July 1, the lowest level since May 17. Gold for
August delivery was 0.9 percent higher at $1,496.10 an ounce on
the Comex in  New York . Floor trading will be closed today for
the Independence Day holiday.  Bullion was little changed at $1,495 an ounce in the
afternoon “fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to
sell output, compared with $1,495.25 at this morning’s fixing.  The ECB on July 7 will increase its benchmark rate to 1.5
percent from 1.25 percent, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. That may boost demand for the euro. Gold
typically moves counter to the greenback.  Gold’s Record  Gold is up 5.3 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades.
 Europe ’s debt crisis helped bullion reach a record $1,577.57 on
May 2. Finance chiefs gather next week to discuss a long-term
lifeline for  Greece . A proposed debt rollover plan for Greece
may still put the country in “effective default,”  Standard &
Poor’s  said.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reduced
their net-long position in gold futures by 18 percent to 165,902
contracts in the week ended June 28, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data. That’s the biggest pullback
since October 2008.  “Seasonal trends tend to be positive in the third quarter
for gold and this current dip offers entry opportunities for
gold once technicals hint at stabilization,” Stefan Graber, an
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a report today.  The metal is still “far away” from a mania and investors
should own more gold, Ronald Stoeferle, a commodities analyst at
Erste Group Bank AG, said today from Vienna on Bloomberg
Television’s “The Pulse.” Gold will rise to $2,000 in 12
months, he said in a report e-mailed today.  “Every trend ends in euphoria and excess and that’s what’s
going to lead us to $2,300 an ounce, which is the inflation-
adjusted all-time high,” he said.  Silver for immediate delivery rose 0.7 percent to $34.125
an ounce in  London . Palladium was little changed at $759.50 an
ounce. Platinum was 0.1 percent higher at $1,722 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
