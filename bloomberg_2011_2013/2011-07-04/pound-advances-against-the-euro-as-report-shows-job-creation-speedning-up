U.K. government bonds snapped a five-
day decline after a report showed a measure of construction fell
more than estimated in June, adding to speculation that the  Bank
of England  will keep  interest rates  at a record low.  Ten-year gilts rose after the gauge from Markit Economics
Ltd. and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  showed
confidence weakened “sharply” last month to the lowest level
since December. The pound appreciated against the euro for the
first time in six days, recovering from a 15-month low, before
paring gains.  “The U.K. economy is going through a lean patch and
there’s a realization that rates will stay lower for longer,”
said Shant Movsesian, a strategist in London at 4Cast Ltd., a
researcher that counts central banks among its subscribers.
“That’s flattening the yield curve.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt declined three basis points
to 3.36 percent as of 4:14 p.m. in  London . The 3.75 percent
security due September 2020 rose 0.20, or 2 pounds per 1,000-
pound ($1,608) face amount, to 103.05. Two-year note yields were
little changed at 0.81 percent.  Worsening economic growth has prompted traders to reduce
bets on higher U.K. rates. The implied yield on short-sterling
futures expiring in March fell one basis point to 1.02 percent,
and have tumbled from a nine-month high of 2.08 percent in
February, when some traders were expecting an imminent increase.
Short-sterling futures are used by analysts to gauge the future
trajectory of borrowing costs between banks.  The central bank will keep its key rate unchanged at 0.5
percent on July 7 when it announces its next monetary-policy
decision, according to all 51 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Debt Sale Tomorrow  The U.K.’s Debt Management Office plans to sell 3.25
billion pounds of 3.75 percent gilts due September 2021
tomorrow.  Investors are betting the central bank won’t raise
borrowing costs until after next May, according to forward
contracts on the sterling overnight interbank average, data from
Tullett Prebon Plc show. As recently as February, the data
showed traders were betting on an increase in May of this year.  The measure of U.K. building activity based on a survey of
purchasing managers slipped to 53.6 from 54 in May, the Markit
data today showed. The reading was below the 53.8 median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, though it stayed
above 50, which indicates expansion.  Separate data today showed U.K. job creation accelerated in
June. The Reed Job Index rose to 125 from 121 in May as
insurance and engineering companies increased hiring, the
London-based company, which runs Britain’s largest recruitment
website, said in a report today.  Pound Gains  Sterling gained versus most of its 16 major peers tracked
by Bloomberg, climbing most against the Australian dollar.  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to 90.25 pence per euro
after strengthening as much as 0.4 percent to 90.05 pence. It
weakened to 90.84 pence on July 1, the lowest since March 2010.
Sterling was little changed against the dollar at $1.6080 and
gained less than 0.1 percent to 130.01 yen.  “Any sign that employment prospects are improving is a
good sign, but we’re still cautious on the growth outlook for
the U.K. economy,” said  Sarah Hewin , a senior economist at
Standard Chartered Bank in London. “The Bank of England isn’t
likely to raise interest rates for some time. Rates staying on
hold for a prolonged period are likely to continue pulling
sterling weaker.”  A separate report by Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets showed
that 13 percent of employed respondents in a survey of 2,000
consumers from June 17-26 said they felt there had been an
improvement in  job security , while 34 percent said there had
been a deterioration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
