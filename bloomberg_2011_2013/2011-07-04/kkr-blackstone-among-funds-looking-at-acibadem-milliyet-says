Private-equity firms KKR & Co.,
Permira Advisers LLP,  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and Bridgepoint
Capital Ltd. are among companies that may bid for Turkish
hospital chain Acibadem Saglik Hizmetleri & Ticaret AS,  Milliyet 
reported.  The sale value of Istanbul-based Acibadem is $1.6 billion
to $2 billion, the newspaper said, without saying where it got
the information. The company is 92 percent owned by Almond
Holding AS, in which Dubai-based Abraaj Capital Ltd. holds a 50
percent stake;  Turkey ’s Aydinlar family owns the other 50
percent, according to Acibadem’s website.  Almond hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Bank of America
Merrill Lynch to examine strategic options for Acibadem, the
company said in a June 30 filing to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange .  Almond  plans either to sell its entire stake to a single
buyer or offer the shares on the market, two people said on June
17. The people declined to be identified because the talks are
private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
