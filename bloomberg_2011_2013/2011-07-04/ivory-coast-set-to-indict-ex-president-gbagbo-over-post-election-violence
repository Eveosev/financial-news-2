Ivory Coast  is preparing to formally
indict former President Laurent Gbagbo with endangering state
security, embezzlement and setting up armed gangs, the
prosecutor involved, Simplice Kouadio Koffi, said in an
interview today.  “We are currently preparing a letter to the constitutional
council” to seek authority to move ahead with the charges,
Koffi said.  Gbagbo refused to cede power after elections in November to
the internationally recognized winner  Alassane Ouattara . Gbagbo
was captured in April following more than a month of fighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
