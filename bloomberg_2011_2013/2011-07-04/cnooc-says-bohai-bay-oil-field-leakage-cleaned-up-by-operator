ConocoPhillips (COP)  said an oil leak at
the Penglai 19-3 oilfield in China’s Bohai Bay has been
contained and clean-up work is close to completion.  No injuries nor impact to wildlife, fishing or shipping were
reported, Houston-based Conoco said today in an e-mailed
statement.  China’s State Oceanic Administration may announce the
results of an investigation into the spill during its monthly
press conference tomorrow, Jiang Yongzhi, the Beijing-based
spokesman for  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , which owns 51 percent stake of the
field, said by telephone from Beijing today. ConocoPhillips, the
operator of the field, owns the remaining 49 percent stake.  The leak affected an area of about 200 square meters (2,153
square feet) and had a relatively small impact on the marine
environment,  China  National Radio reported today, citing an
unnamed official at Cnooc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
