The Israeli government has chosen
 Rand  Corp. to provide advice on the country’s long-term economic
strategy.  Rand will assist a government team in “formulating a long-
term strategy that will advance the state of Israel toward
becoming one of the leading countries in the world in quality of
life for its citizens,” the prime minister’s office and  Finance
Ministry  said in a joint statement today.  Rand, a nonprofit research institution which aims to
improve policy and decision making through research and
analysis, was chosen in a government tender, the statement said.
It is partnering with Shaldor, an Israel-based strategy
consulting firm for this project.  “Their role will be to assist the government team in
gathering material, presenting international comparisons, and
models of similar processes that may be appropriate for
 Israel ,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
