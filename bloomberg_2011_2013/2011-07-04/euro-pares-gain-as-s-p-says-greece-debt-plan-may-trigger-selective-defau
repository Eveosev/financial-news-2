The euro pared its gain against the
dollar and erased an advance against the yen after  Standard &
Poor’s  said a debt rollover plan for  Greece  may put the country
in “selective default.”  The euro traded at $1.4528 as of 6:13 a.m. in  London  from
$1.4526 in  New York  on July 1, after earlier gaining as much as
0.4 percent.  Europe ’s shared currency was at 117.33 yen from
117.42 last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
