Brazilian  hedge funds  doubled bets
that shares of retailer Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo
Pao de Acucar will decline on speculation a proposed merger with
 Carrefour SA (CA) ’s unit in  Brazil  may fail to win approval.  Pao de Acucar stocks on loan, an indication of short
selling,  rose  to 6.957 million shares, or 496.3 million reais on
July 1, from 2.69 million shares, or 176.4 million reais on June
27,  before  the merger announcement, according to Brazil’s
clearing and depositary corporation. The average daily volume
over the past 12 months was 963,566 trades, according to
Bloomberg data.  The merger plan was proposed to Carrefour last month by Rio
de Janeiro-based Banco BTG Pactual SA investment fund Gama,
spurring a power struggle with shareholder Casino Guichard-
Perrachon SA. Saint-Etienne-based Casino responded by buying an
additional 6.2 percent stake in Pao de Acucar to an overall 43.1
percent stake, bidding up the stock price 13 percent the day of
the announcement. Pao de Acucar sank 3 percent today to 70.80
reais at 12:45 p.m. New York time.  “The increase was mostly due to Casino raising its stake
as well as the good prospects and potential synergy if the
merger would go through,” said Rodrigo Bresser-Pereira, who
manage 250 million reais at Bresser Administracao de Recursos, a
Sao Paulo-based hedge fund. “Casino’s stake increase distorted
the price and if the merger doesn’t go through the stock could
fall a lot.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
