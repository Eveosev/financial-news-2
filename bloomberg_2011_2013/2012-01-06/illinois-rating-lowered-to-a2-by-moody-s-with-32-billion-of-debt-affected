Illinois (STOIL1)  had its general-obligation
bond rating reduced by Moody’s Investors Service to A2 from A1,
making it the company’s lowest-graded U.S. state.  The downgrade to the sixth-highest rating came after a
legislative session that “took no steps to implement lasting
solutions to its severe pension under-funding or to its chronic
bill payment delays,” Moody’s said in a report.  Illinois , it
said, has “weak management practices.”  Moody’s revised its outlook on the debt to stable from
negative, citing the state’s sovereign power over revenue and
spending, and laws that establish the priority of payment for
general-obligation bonds. The downgrade affects $32 billion of
debt, according to the statement.  “Although the state has taken positive steps toward fiscal
stability, swift bipartisan action to implement further cost
reductions and reforms in the upcoming legislative session are
needed to stabilize the budget,”  Kelly Kraft , a spokeswoman for
Governor  Pat Quinn , said in a statement.  Illinois, the fifth-most-populous U.S. state, plans to sell
$800 million in taxable and tax-exempt general-obligation bonds
as soon as Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
