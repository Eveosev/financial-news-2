Motorola Mobility Inc. (MMI) , the phone
maker that agreed to be bought by  Google (GOOG)  Inc., reported
preliminary fourth-quarter sales that trailed analysts’
estimates, citing mounting competition and higher legal costs.  Sales were probably little changed at $3.4 billion in the
period, Libertyville, Illinois-based Motorola Mobility said in a
statement today. Bloomberg analysts had forecast revenue of $4
billion. Motorola, which recently won a German patent ruling
against  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , cited higher costs from intellectual
property litigation and an “increased competitive environment”
in the mobile-device market in the quarter.  The handset maker said it shipped about 10.5 million
devices during the period, of which more than half were
smartphones.  The company said it expects to complete its transaction
with Mountain View, California-based Google early this year.
Motorola fell 0.4 percent to $38.30 in extended trading, after
closing at $38.46. The shares  rose (MMI)  33 percent last year. The
company plans to report earnings on Jan. 26.  To contact the writer of this column:
