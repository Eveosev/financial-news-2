Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s Lovefilm unit,
which streams movies and television to subscribers online,
reached deals for shows from  ITV Plc (ITV)  and BBC Worldwide before
competitor Netflix arrives in the U.K. later this year.  Lovefilm’s agreements with the London-based companies
include rights to ITV’s “Cold Feet” and “Secret Diary of a
Call Girl” and BBC programs such as “Planet Earth” and
“Doctor Who,” according to statements today.  Streaming services are competing for content in an
increasingly crowded market. ITV and the BBC have their own
online services and Netflix will start selling subscriptions in
the U.K. and Ireland early this year. Netflix announced a
similar deal with the BBC last month and is in discussions with
ITV for archived shows, a spokeswoman said.  The subscription TV market in  Europe , Africa and the  Middle
East , including pay-TV, video-on-demand, mobile and video-
streaming services as well as license fees, will expand 24
percent to $95 billion in the next four years, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Internet-streamed videos are
forecast to be the fastest growing segment.  The agreements with Amazon are not exclusive, and other
providers will be able to carry the same shows at the same time,
said spokespeople from Lovefilm, the BBC and ITV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
