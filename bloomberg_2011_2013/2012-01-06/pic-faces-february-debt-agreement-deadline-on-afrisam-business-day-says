The Public Investment Corp. has until
next month to reach agreement with stakeholders on restructuring
about 20 billion rand of debt in South African cement-maker
Afrisam Ltd., Business Day reported, without saying where it got
the information.  The amount includes about 12 billion rand of senior debt
due on Feb. 3, the Johannesburg-based daily said. The PIC, the
state pension-fund manager, gained regulatory approval last
month to take control of Afrisam.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
