Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , a Brazilian consumer
goods maker, headed for the biggest gain since August after a
report that Banco BTG Pactual SA is in talks to join a
controlling block of shareholders.  Hypermarcas  rose (HYPE3)  6.4 percent to 10 reais at 1:44 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo . Thatâ€™s the steepest one-day gain on a closing basis
since Aug. 23. The  Bovespa (IBOV)  rose 0.1 percent.  Sonia Racy, a columnist for the O Estado de S. Paulo
newspaper, reported that BTG is in talks to join the controlling
block of Hypermarcas, without saying where she obtained the
information.  BTG and Hypermarcas each declined to comment, according to
external press officers who asked not to be identified in
accordance with company policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
