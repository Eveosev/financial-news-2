President  Barack Obama  will propose a
0.5 percent pay increase for civilian federal employees in his
fiscal 2013 budget, according to an administration official.  Obama ordered a two-year pay freeze for the approximately 2
million civilian government workers in November 2010 to show his
commitment to slowing government spending. The proposal may run
into opposition in Congress, which would have to approve the
increase.  During a debate last year,  House Republicans  wanted to
continue the pay freeze to offset the cost of extending the two
percentage point  payroll tax (FFSTEMPL)  reduction for all of 2012. Obama
and Congress will try to find a compromise on how to pay for the
tax holiday beyond the two-month extension they agreed to before
Christmas.  The White House notified federal agencies of the pay raise
plan this morning, according to the official, who wasn’t
authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be named. The
government’s 2013 fiscal year begins Oct. 1.  The proposal was reported earlier by the Washington Post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
