German President  Christian Wulff 
won’t participate in a mediation procedure requested by
investors over his role as supervisory board member at
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  during Porsche SE’s attempt to take over the
company, CMS Hasche Sigle said.  Wulff had received the request and will not participate,
CMS, a law firm that represents current and former VW
supervisory board members, said today in a statement. Wulff sat
on VW’s board from 2003 to 2010.  A total of 67 banks, insurance companies and funds are
demanding 1.8 billion euros ($2.3 billion) of compensation from
Wulff for alleged shortcomings in his former role,
 WirtschaftsWoche  reported today, citing a formal request it
obtained for mediation procedures provided for under German law.  The request, filed Dec. 28 with CenaCom in Karlsruhe,
claims Wulff had early knowledge of  Porsche SE (PAH3) ’s plans to take
over Volkswagen and failed to inform investors, the magazine
said. The plaintiffs are seeking the same compensation from
Porsche and Volkswagen in a complaint filed in a Braunschweig
court, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
