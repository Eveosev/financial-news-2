Crude-oil shipments aboard
supertankers bound for  China  climbed 11 percent this week,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vessels with a total carrying capacity of 18.1 million
deadweight tons are heading for the Asian nation, up from 16.3
million tons last week. About 14 percent of the total fleet of
the largest  oil tankers  signaling future destinations is bound
for China, the world’s biggest energy consumer. The ships would
haul about 132 million barrels of oil, assuming a conversion
factor of 7.33 barrels a ton.  The following table shows the destinations and combined
carrying capacity in deadweight tons of 418 very large crude
carriers, out of a global fleet of 560, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Average drafts are expressed as a
percentage of maximum sailing depth and are an indication of
cargo size. Each country’s percentage share of total oil
shipments is shown for the current and prior weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
