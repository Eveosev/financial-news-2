Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis, the
U.S. ambassador to Hungary, rejected a news report that
Washington is lobbying to have Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
replaced with a technocratic government.  “I can tell you absolutely, clearly, that this is not  U.S.
foreign policy , that is not our position and this report is
untrue,” Kounalakis said today in an interview to be broadcast
on ATV private television. Bloomberg News obtained the excerpt
of the interview from the embassy.  Budapest-based news website Index  reported  yesterday,
citing unidentified people involved in U.S. foreign policy, that
the U.S. may press Hungary to replace Orban as the only option
to avert a default.  To contact the reporters on this story:
