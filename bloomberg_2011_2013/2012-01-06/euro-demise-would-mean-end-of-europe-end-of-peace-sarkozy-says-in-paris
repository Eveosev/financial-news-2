The death of the single European
currency would mean “the end of  Europe  and the end of peace,”
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said.  “We have no right to let the euro die,” Sarkozy said in
the closing speech of the “New Worlds” conference in Paris.
“I am convinced that the European Union and the euro zone have
the capacity and the will to overcome the current crisis.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
