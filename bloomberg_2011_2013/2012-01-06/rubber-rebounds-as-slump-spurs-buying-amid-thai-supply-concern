Rubber gained as a drop to near a
six-week low lured buyers amid speculation that supply from
 Thailand , the largest exporter, may be disrupted because of
heavy rains and flooding.  June-delivery rubber added as much as 0.6 percent to 269.6
yen a kilogram ($3,492 a metric ton) before trading at 269 yen
on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange by 12:39 p.m. local time. The
price yesterday dropped to 258.7 yen, the lowest since Nov. 24.
It has gained 2.1 percent this week on signs of improvement in
the  U.S. economy , rebounding from a 4.7 percent drop last week.  Rain will increase in southern Thailand between Jan. 6-8
and may cause flash floods and landslides, the Department of
Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said in a statement
yesterday. Ten provinces in the southern region are flooded, it
said. The south accounts for 80 percent of output.  “If floods cause disruption in rubber supply, that will
boost prices as production is set for a seasonal decrease in
coming months,” said Ken Kajisa, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki
Co. in  Tokyo , said today by phone.  Production declines in Thailand during the so-called
wintering season starting around February, when trees shed
leaves and latex output slows. Users usually replenish rubber
stockpiles before the low-production season begins, Kajisa said.  Gains were limited as investor appetite for riskier assets
waned after higher borrowing costs in a French bond auction
stoked concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  France  sold
7.96 billion euros ($10.2 billion) of debt, with borrowing costs
rising in its first bond auction of the year, as credit
companies threaten to cut the nation’s AAA rating.  May-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was
little changed at 24,425 yuan ($3,873) a ton at 11:02 a.m. local
time. The  Thai cash price (THAISR3A)  dropped 0.9 percent to 104.95 baht
($3.32) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
