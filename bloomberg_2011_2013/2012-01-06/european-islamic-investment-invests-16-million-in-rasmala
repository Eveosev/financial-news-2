European Islamic Investment Bank Plc (EIIB) 
plans to invest $16 million in Rasmala Holdings Ltd. and buy
shares from the Dubai-based investment bank and brokerage’s
chairman as the companies develop a strategic partnership.  The $16 million investment will be implemented over 12
months as EIIB converts a financing facility into Rasmala shares
valued at 35 percent of the brokerage’s outstanding stock, the
London-based lender said in a statement today. EIIB will also
acquire 7.6 percent of Rasmala stock from Chairman Ali Al Shihabi in exchange for 3.5 million pounds ($5.4 million) of its
own shares, the company said.  EIIB will receive the majority of Rasmala’s so-called
management shares, allowing the London-based lender to appoint
more than half the company’s directors and to influence company
management, according to the statement.  Rasmala forecast a full-year loss before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortization and restructuring charges of $7
million for 2011. The company anticipates an improvement in
results in 2012 after cutting costs and reorganizing operations,
EIIB said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
