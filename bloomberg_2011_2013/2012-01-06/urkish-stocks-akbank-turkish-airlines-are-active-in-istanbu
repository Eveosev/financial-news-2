Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 2 percent to 50,182.53 at the close in Istanbul,
falling for a third day and bringing its weekly loss to 2.1
percent.  The following were among the active equities in the Turkish
market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  , the bank part-owned by Citigroup
Inc., slumped 2.7 percent to 5.76 liras after rising as much as
2.4 percent in intraday trading following its announcement of a
new chief executive. Akbank replaced Ziya Akkurt with Sabri Hakan Binbasgil, a former head of Akbank’s retail and
organizational restructuring departments who was acting deputy
CEO, according to an announcement to the exchange after the
close yesterday.  Ege Endustri & Ticaret AS (EGEEN)  , a car parts maker,
gained 0.9 percent to 43.40 liras. The company signed a letter
of intent with Germany’s Neapco  Europe  GmbH to study possible
joint production in Turkey, it said in a statement to the
exchange today.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  , Turkey’s largest
bank by market value, plunged 4.1 percent to 5.62 liras, its
lowest since February 2010, leading declines on the market as
fears of more bad news out of Europe discouraged investors from
remaining long Turkey over the weekend, according to Bali Ekin,
head of equity trading at Amsterdam-based Credit Europe Bank NV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
