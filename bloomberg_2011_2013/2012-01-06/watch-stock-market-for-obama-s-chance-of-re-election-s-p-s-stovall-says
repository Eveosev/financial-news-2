Whether President  Barack Obama  will
win re-election this year may be foreseen by the stock market,
according to Sam Stovall of  Standard & Poor’s .  The performance of the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  between July 31 and
Oct. 31 in presidential election years coincided with the result
since 1948: When the gauge rose, the incumbent or his party won
89 percent of the time, and when it fell, they lost 86 percent
of the time, according to data compiled by New York-based S&P.  The  S&P 500  “will probably do a better job than the
plethora of political pundits prognosticating on the
presidency,” Stovall, S&P’s chief equity strategist, wrote in a
note dated Jan. 3. “Since 1948, this election-prognostication
technique did an excellent job.”  Strategists at the biggest Wall Street firms see the
benchmark  stock index  rallying 6.9 percent in 2012, according to
the median of 12 projections in a Bloomberg News survey. Obama
has a 52 percent chance of keeping his job, according to  bets 
placed on InTrade’s online system. Obama, a Democrat, is seeking
a second term as Republicans evaluate candidates including Mitt Romney for the Nov. 6 election.  The S&P 500 fell to a 12-year low less than two months
after Obama took office in 2009, following the biggest financial
crisis in seven decades. The measure then posted the largest
rally since the 1930s.  Another indicator shows U.S. stocks have the biggest gains
in the third year of president’s terms. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  has gained 12 percent on average, the most during the
four-year cycle, according to data since 1897. The Dow added 5.5
percent in 2011, the smallest third-year rally since 1987. It
hasn’t fallen since 1939.  To contact the reporter on this story:
