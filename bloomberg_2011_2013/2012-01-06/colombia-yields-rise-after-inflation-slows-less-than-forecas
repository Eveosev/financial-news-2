Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields on benchmark securities up the most in two weeks, after a
government report showed inflation slowed less than forecast at
the end of 2011.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.53
percent, according to the stock exchange. That’s the biggest
increase since Dec. 22. The price on the peso bonds, known as
TES, fell 0.355 centavo to 119.518 centavos. The peso closed
little changed at 1,880.35 per  U.S. dollar  from 1,880.50
yesterday.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.73 percent in December from
3.96 percent in November, the national statistics agency said in
a  report  late yesterday. Economists forecast inflation would
slow to 3.60 percent, according to the median estimate of 23
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank’s inflation
target in 2011 and 2012 is 2 percent to 4 percent.  “Some investors with more speculative, short-term
positions, are using the inflation data to sell TES,” said
Pedro Ospina, a fixed-income analyst at Interbolsa SA,
Colombia’s biggest brokerage.  Consumer prices rose 0.42 percent in December, more than
the 0.30 percent forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Food, education and housing prices led the increase in consumer
prices in 2011, according to the government report.  Inflation within the central bank’s target, the expanding
economy and “good” fiscal numbers will likely lead yields on
the peso bonds due 2024 to fall to 7.4 percent this month,
Ospina said.  ‘Hawkish’  The government said last month strong economic growth,
which is driving  tax revenue  higher, will lead the consolidated
 budget deficit  -- which includes states, municipalities and
state-run companies -- to narrow to 1.8 percent of gross
domestic product this year from a projected 2.9 percent of GDP
in 2011.  Colombia’s economy expanded 7.7 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the fourth
quarter of 2006. The economy may grow as much as 6 percent in
2011, the fastest pace since 2007, according to the central
bank.  “The higher-than-expected December inflation reading and
still exuberant real sector and credit dynamics are likely to
keep the central bank language relatively hawkish and certainly
increases the risk that we could see another rate hike during
the first quarter,”  Alberto Ramos , a Latin America economist at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  New York , wrote in a report
yesterday.  Policy makers in November raised the key rate a quarter
percentage point to 4.75 percent, citing the need to bolster the
central bank’s credibility after “strong” growth drove up
inflation expectations, according to minutes of the meeting. The
central bank left the rate unchanged in the Dec. 16 meeting.  The Colombian peso jumped 3.1 percent in the last five
days, its biggest weekly advance since the period ended Feb. 12,
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
