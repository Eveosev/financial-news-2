The  International Monetary Fund  will
make a “fairly substantial” cut to its forecast for global
economic growth this year,  Olivier Blanchard , the IMF’s chief
economist, said today.  “I can’t give you a number,” Blanchard said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television from a conference in Chicago.
“It’s going to be substantial.”  In September, the Washington-based fund lowered its
forecast for global growth to 4 percent in 2012 and warned of
“severe” repercussions if  Europe  failed to contain its
sovereign debt crisis.  Overall world growth will probably be “not very far” from
3 percent to 4 percent, he said, adding Europe is “very close
to zero at this point” while the U.S. is in better shape than
many other nations.  A government report today in Washington showed the
unemployment rate in the U.S. declined in December to 8.5
percent, the lowest in almost three years.  Blanchard’s comments about revisions to the global outlook
are stronger than those made today by his chief, IMF Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde , on a visit to Pretoria, South
Africa.  The fund will publish revised forecasts on Jan. 24 or Jan.
25 that are “consistent with reality,” Lagarde told reporters.
“We should all be prepared for a 2012 that will not be a walk
in the park.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
