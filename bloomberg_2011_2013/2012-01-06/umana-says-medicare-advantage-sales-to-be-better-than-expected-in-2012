Humana Inc. (HUM) , the second-largest U.S.
Medicare managed-care provider, said 2012 sales in its line of
Advantage plans will be better than expected.  The company anticipates membership growth will be higher
than the previous forecast of 145,000 to 150,000 new members,
Louisville-based Humana said today in a regulatory filing. Net
growth of stand-alone prescription drug plans will remain within
the estimated 500,000 to 600,000 range, Humana said.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. serves the most members in
Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled,
with more than 7 million as of Sept. 30, company filings show.
Humana is second with 4.3 million in managed care and
prescription drug programs.  “I’m still on an expansion mode,” Humana Chief Executive
Officer Michael McCallister said about the program in a
presentation yesterday. “Every year we are announcing new
locations with either new products or new geography.”  Humana announced the estimates after receiving more data
from the government about people dropping the plans. The company
will present the numbers Jan. 10 at a conference in  San
Francisco .  Medicare Advantage is a program sold by commercial insurers
that covers and helps coordinate medical services, physician
fees and hospitalizations.  Humana gained less than 1 percent to $92.25 at the close of
New York trading and has  increased (HUM)  62 percent in the past 12
months.  -- Editors: Andrew Pollack, Angela Zimm  To contact the reporter on this story:
