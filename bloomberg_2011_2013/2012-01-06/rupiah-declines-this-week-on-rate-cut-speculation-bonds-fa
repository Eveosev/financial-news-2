Indonesia ’s rupiah completed a third
weekly decline on speculation slowing inflation provides the
central bank with an opportunity to cut its benchmark  interest
rate .  Government bonds  fell.  The currency rose by the most in more than three months
today. Bank Indonesia sees room to reduce borrowing costs if
needed, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said in  Singapore 
yesterday. Governor Darmin Nasution left the rate unchanged at 6
percent last month and the next review is on Jan. 12. Inflation
in December was the least in 21 months, data showed this week.  “Another interest-rate cut of 25 to 50 basis points is
expected in the first quarter,” said Wiwig Santoso, head of
treasury and markets at PT Bank DBS Indonesia in Jakarta.  The rupiah dropped 0.3 percent this week to 9,098 per
dollar as of 4:04 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It strengthened 1 percent
today after being down 0.2 percent earlier. The central bank
plans to boost “intervention” to support the rupiah, Governor
Darmin Nasution said Nov. 30.  Consumer prices in Indonesia rose 3.79 percent in December
from a year earlier after increasing 4.15 percent the previous
month, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said Jan. 2.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022

6.21 percent, according to midday prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association. The rate advanced five basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
