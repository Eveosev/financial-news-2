Infoblox Inc., a network and data-
services provider, plans to raise as much as $125 million in an
initial public offering.  The  Santa Clara , California-based company hired Morgan
Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to manage the IPO,
according to a regulatory filing today. Infoblox didn’t specify
the number or price of shares it will offer in the filing. The
size is a placeholder amount used to estimate registration fees
and may change.  Internet companies including Facebook Inc. may raise $11
billion this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Last year,
19 Internet companies generated $6.6 billion in U.S. initial
share sales.  Proceeds of the offering will go to working capital and
general corporate purposes, and possibly acquisitions, Infoblox
said in its filing. Revenue increased 35 percent to $39.4
million in the three months through October. The net loss was
$1.8 million, compared with net income of $206,000 in the year-
earlier period, the regulatory filing showed.  Infoblox’s services allow companies to automate certain
processes on their  computer networks . It counts Barclays Plc,
 Wells Fargo & Co ., Boeing Co., International Business Machines
Corp. and the  Federal Aviation Administration  among its
customers, according to the filing.  Venture-capital firm  Sequoia Capital  owns 29 percent of
Infoblox, the filing shows. The shares will list on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol BLOX.  To contact the reporter on this story:
