French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said
that developing nations need greater representation on the
United Nations Security Council, returning to a theme that he
championed without success a year ago.  “How can we accept that India,  Japan , Brazil or even
Africa are not permanent members of the security council,”
Sarkozy said in Paris at the closing session of a two-day
conference. “We are running the world with institutions based
on the world of 1945.”  Sarkozy had planned to make updating world governance one
of the priorities of last year’s French presidency of the G-20
only to have the year dominated by the European debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
