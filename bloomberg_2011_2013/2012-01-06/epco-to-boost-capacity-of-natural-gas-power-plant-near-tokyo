Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  will expand
the capacity of gas turbines at its Chiba power station near
Tokyo as part of measures to make up for the loss of atomic
power following the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster.  The expansion will turn three turbines into more efficient
combined cycle units that use waste heat to produce additional
electricity. The plan will add about 500 megawatts to the
station bringing capacity to 1,500 megawatts by July 2014, the
utility  said  in a statement on its website.  One of the 334-megawatt gas turbines started operation in
August, another in September and the third will start this July.
The combined-cycle expansion will start after all three are
running, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
