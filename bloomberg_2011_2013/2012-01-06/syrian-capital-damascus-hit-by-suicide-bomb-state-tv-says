Syria ’s capital, Damascus, was hit by
a suicide bomb that left about 25 people dead and 46 wounded,
according to initial estimates, the  state-run Syrian Arab News
Agency said . It was the second such attack in two weeks.  The bomber carried out the attack at a traffic light near a
school in the al-Midan district today, and was targeting the
security forces, SANA said. Civilians also died, it said. Images
from the scene broadcast by state television showed the back
seat of a bus littered with broken glass and soaked in blood.  The violence comes as additional Arab League monitors are
arriving in Syria to help monitor President Bashar al-Assad’s
pledge to end a crackdown on protests. Assad has repeatedly
blamed “terrorists” and foreign provocateurs for fomenting
anti-government protests in a conflict that has left more than
5,000 people dead by United Nations estimates.  Syria said al-Qaeda linked militants killed more than 40
people in an assault on two security-service buildings in
Damascus last month, as the first batch of  Arab League  observers
arrived in the country. The league is due to meet in Cairo on
Jan. 8 to discuss the findings of its monitors so far.  Assad promised in an accord with the Arab League to
withdraw security forces from cities, release political
prisoners and allow anti-government demonstrations.  U.S.- and European-led efforts to seek punitive action
against Assad at the  United Nations Security Council  have been
resisted by countries including China and  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
