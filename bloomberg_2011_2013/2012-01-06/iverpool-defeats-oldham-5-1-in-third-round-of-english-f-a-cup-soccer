Liverpool overcame an early deficit
to defeat Oldham 5-1 in the third round of English soccer’s F.A.
Cup.  Craig Bellamy  and Steven Gerrard scored in the first half
yesterday at Anfield stadium for Liverpool, which has won the
F.A. Cup seven times. Jonjo Shelvey, Andy Carroll and  Stewart
Downing  added goals in the second half for the Reds, who are
among the 20 Premier League clubs entering England’s top club
competition in this round.  Robbie Simpson scored for Oldham, which plays in third-tier
League One and is ranked 52 places below Liverpool.  Simpson opened the scoring in the 27th minute, only to have
Bellamy tie the game two minutes later and Gerrard give
Liverpool the lead for good on a penalty in first-half injury
time.  “The scoreline is a bit flattering really,” Liverpool
manager  Kenny Dalglish  told reporters. “The scoreline does not
reflect the distance between the two teams on that
performance.”  Newcastle hosts Blackburn in an all-Premier League matchup
among today’s games and Stoke, last year’s runner-up, visits
fourth-tier Gillingham. Manchester City opens defense of its
title when it hosts record 11-time F.A. Cup winner Manchester
United tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
