Freddie Mac (FMCC) , the mortgage-finance
firm operating under U.S. conservatorship, will let unemployed
homeowners delay up to a year’s worth of loan payments to help
keep families in their homes.  Borrowers whose loans are owned or guaranteed by  Freddie
Mac  can take advantage of the extension beginning Feb. 1, the
McLean, Virginia-based company said today in a statement.  “We believe this will put more families back on track to
successful long-term homeownership,” Tracy Mooney, a senior
vice president at Freddie Mac, said in the statement.  Freddie Mac previously allowed unemployed borrowers to
suspend payments for as long as three months or make reduced
payments for six months. The debt isn’t forgiven and borrowers
eventually must repay the company.  Almost 10 percent of delinquencies on Freddie Mac loans are
tied to unemployment, the company said.  Freddie Mac and larger rival  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  charge lenders a
fee for guaranteeing principal and interest on mortgage loans.
The companies have relied on more than $153 billion in taxpayer
aid to continue operating since 2008, when they were seized by
the federal government amid losses on subprime loans that pushed
the companies toward insolvency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
