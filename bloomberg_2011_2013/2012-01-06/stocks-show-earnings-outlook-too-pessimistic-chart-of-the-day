Earnings probably will be little
changed worldwide this year even though stock prices suggest
they are poised to tumble, according to  Robert Buckland ,
Citigroup Inc.’s chief global equity strategist.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the MSCI World Index is
valued at 13 times earnings, lower than its average of 17 times
for the past four decades. The chart depicts the price-earnings
ratio since 1995 for the index, composed of stocks which trade
in developed markets.  Investors appear to be bracing for a 20 percent earnings
decline in 2012, Buckland wrote two days ago in a report. He
cited estimates made by Citigroup’s regional strategists.  “This seems too pessimistic, even for recessionary
 Europe ,” he wrote. Earnings per share will rise 0.5 percent
worldwide as profit growth outside of finance exceed declines
among financial companies, according to the report. For next
year, he expects a 10.4 percent increase.  Stocks will rise this year as investors’ worst fears aren’t
realized, according to Buckland, who is based in  London . He
estimated that the MSCI All-Country World Index, a barometer of
 emerging markets  as well as countries in the MSCI World, will
climb 20 percent to 360.  Citigroup expects gains of more than 10 percent in the
U.S., the U.K., Europe, Japan, the rest of Asia and Australia
this year. MSCI’s Emerging Markets Index will set the pace by
rising 34 percent to 1,225, according to its strategists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
