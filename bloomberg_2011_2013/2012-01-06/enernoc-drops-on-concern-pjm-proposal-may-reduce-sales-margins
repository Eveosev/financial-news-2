Enernoc Inc. (ENOC) , a company that helps
utilities reduce power demand during peak hours, dropped the
most in almost two months on concerns that rule changes may cut
its sales and profit margins.  Enernoc  sank (ENOC)  9 percent to $9.42 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest decline since Nov. 9. Enernoc, based in Boston, has
dropped 63 percent in the past year.  Enernoc is paid by utilities to acquire large power users
as clients and also for the amount by which it reduces their
consumption of electricity.  PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the largest U.S.
power grid, issued yesterday a  proposal  to the  Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission  that may eliminate these double payments
for Enernoc’s demand-reduction services.  The proposed rule, which would require FERC approval, may
reduce sales from Enernoc’s largest market, said Carter Shoop,
an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. in  San Francisco .  “It shows that PJM is playing hardball,” Shoop said
yesterday in a note to clients. “If the FERC were to accept
PJM’s proposal, Enernoc’s sales and/or margins will be adversely
affected.”  Enernoc didn’t immediately reply to phone calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
