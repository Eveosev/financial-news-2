Fitch Ratings  has downgraded
Hungary’s long-term foreign- and local-currency ratings by one
notch, following similar moves by  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s
Investors Service.  Fitch cut Hungary’s foreign-currency debt to BB+ from BBB-,
reducing it to junk status, and its forint debt to BBB- from
BBB, it said in a statement from London today. The outlook on
the grades is negative.  “The downgrade of Hungary’s ratings reflects further
deterioration in the country’s fiscal and external financing
environment and growth outlook, caused in part by further
unorthodox economic policies which are undermining investor
confidence and complicating the agreement of a new IMF/EU
deal,” says Matteo Napolitano, Director in Fitch’s Sovereign
Group.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
