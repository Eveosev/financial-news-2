Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC television
network ordered five new pilot shows to regain viewers after its
poor start to the new TV season, according to Bob Greenblatt,
head of entertainment.  The pickups follow “a really bad fall,” the networks’s
entertainment chairman said today at a Television Critics
Association meeting today in Pasadena,  California .  NBC will need to add four or five strong, long-running
programs before ratings improve significantly, Greenblatt said.
“Beautiful People,” “The Munsters,” “Isabel,” “Save Me”
and a new program featuring comedian Sarah Silverman are
possible series for the 2012-2013 television season, he said.  “We have nowhere to go but up,” Greenblatt said. “But
it’s going to take a lot of work.”  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, fell 1.1 percent to $24.69
at the close in  New York . Shares of the company, the largest
U.S. cable TV service, climbed 7.9 percent last year.  Greenblatt also said a new broadcast agreement with the
National Football League will “break even or make us a little
money. The NFL put a lot of extra things in that deal,” he said
in an interview. Those include a Thanksgiving day game and an
upgraded playoff game.  To contact the reporters on this story:
