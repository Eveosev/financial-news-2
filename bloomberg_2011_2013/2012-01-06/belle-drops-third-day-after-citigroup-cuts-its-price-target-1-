Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) ,
 China ’s biggest shoe retailer, dropped for a third day after
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. cut its target price on
expectations discounts will crimp profit margins.  The retailer slid 4.3 percent to HK$12.48 at the close in
Hong Kong trading, widening its decline since Jan. 3 to 10
percent. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  closed 1.2 percent lower.  Citigroup cut its target price for Belle by 19 percent to
HK$16.8 and said a lack of further easing of credit conditions
by China’s  central bank (PBOCNET)  may damp sales growth. Net income will
be between 4 percent and 9 percent less than previously forecast
for 2012 and 2013 on “lower gross and operating margins,”
according to the Jan. 3 report by Catherine Lim, an analyst at
Citigroup, who kept her “buy” rating on the stock.  “The selling pressure is likely triggered by the recent
target price cuts,” said Forrest Chan, an analyst at CCB
International Securities Ltd. “Investors are concerned about
the slowdown in sales growth as we’re facing economic
uncertainty and riding on a high base from last year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
