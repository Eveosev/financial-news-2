Ethanol futures were unchanged with
corn in  Chicago  as crude oil dropped and gasoline gained.  Futures capped a third weekly gain as oil fell amid concern
 Europe  may slide into recession and gasoline advanced after the
U.S. added 200,000 jobs in December. Corn is the primary
component in U.S. ethanol, which is blended into gasoline.  “Corn and energy prices took a break from their earlier
moves, leaving ethanol in limbo on thin trading and little
direction,” SCB & Associates wrote in a note to clients today.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery was unchanged to
settle at $2.223 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures
have declined 1.3 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  fell 4 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $2.30 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive lost 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.325, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast decreased 2 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.32 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel slipped
1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.195.  Corn for March delivery was unchanged at $6.435 a bushel in
Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Crude oil for February delivery fell 25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $101.56 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since Dec. 30. The contract
climbed 2.8 percent this week. Prices advanced 8.2 percent in
2011.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 1.51 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.7516 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
