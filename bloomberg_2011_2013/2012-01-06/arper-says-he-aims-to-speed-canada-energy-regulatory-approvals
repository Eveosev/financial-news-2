Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  said he will seek to expedite the regulatory process for
new energy projects, as the country aims to diversify its
exports of oil.  Harper, speaking to reporters in Edmonton, Alberta, said
it’s “essential” for the country to build the capacity to sell
the country’s energy to  Asia . Harper said he will look more
closely into complaints that “foreign money” is being used to
“overload” the regulatory process.  “We have to have processes in Canada that come to a
decision in a reasonable amount of time, and processes that
cannot be hijacked,” Harper said. “The government of Canada
will be taking a close look at how we can ensure our regulatory
processes are effective and deliver decisions in a reasonable
amount of time.”  Canada will begin hearings next week on a proposed pipeline
by  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  to ship crude from Alberta’s oil sands to
British Columbia. Harper declined to comment on that specific
project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
