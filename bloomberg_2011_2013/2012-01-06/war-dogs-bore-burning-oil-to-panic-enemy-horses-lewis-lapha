In addition to being loyal companions
over the millennia, dogs have been trained to do everything from
hunting down food to attacking strangers.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In battle, Greeks used “fire helmets,” specially trained
dogs that carried pots of burning oil on their heads to scare
enemy horses. Celtic catch dogs were taught to chomp onto the
noses of oncoming equines.  In our time, working dogs sniff out explosives and
contraband and help people with disabilities. But as more
canines are bred as bio-jewelry and emblems of conspicuous
consumption, valuable traits such as curiosity, boldness and
playfulness are disappearing. More than 400 genetic ailments
have been found in U.S. purebred pooches.  I spoke with Mark Derr, author of “How the Dog Became the
Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends,” on the following topics:  1. Big Game Hunters  2. Genetic Changes  3. Ratters & Hunters  4. Show-Off Dogs  5. Individual Personalities  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
