Slovenian companies need 4 billion
euros ($5.1 billion) of fresh capital to become “capable” of
taking out new loans, Finance reported, citing central bank
Governor Marko Kranjec.  “This money is needed to boost their capital not
investment,” Kranjec was quoted by the newspaper as saying
today in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana. “Bank losses will be
even bigger this year as assets continue to decline, the fight
for deposits intensifies and financing from abroad shrinks.”  Kranjec said Slovenia won’t experience any economic growth
this year, as the jobless rate rises further and losses at
companies increase, Finance reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
