Soybeans fell, capping the biggest
two-day drop in six weeks, on speculation that a faltering
global economy will damp prospects for commodity consumption.
Corn recorded a weekly decline.  Christine Lagarde , the managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, said today that the global economic
outlook “is quite gloomy” amid Europe’s “escalating” debt
woes. Soybeans posted the first weekly drop since in a month,
partly on signs that weather conditions will improve in Brazil
and Argentina, bolstering crops.  “Demand is weak,”  Anne Frick , the senior oilseed analyst
at Jefferies Bache Commodities LLC in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “There’s still time for rain to improve
crop yields in  South America ” after dry weather in the past
month threatened to reduce yields, she said.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 1 percent to close
at $11.965 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
In two days, the price dropped 2.7 percent, the most since the
end of November. The oilseed fell 0.9 percent this week.  Corn futures for March delivery were unchanged at $6.435 a
bushel in Chicago. The grain fell 0.5 percent this week after a
two-week gain of 11 percent.  Most of Argentina and southern Brazil will get as much as
1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) of rain beginning Jan. 9, World
Weather Inc. in Overland Park, Kansas, said in a report.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
