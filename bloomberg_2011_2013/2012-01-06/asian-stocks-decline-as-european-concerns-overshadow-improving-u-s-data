Asian  stocks (MXAP)  fell and the regional
benchmark index pared weekly gains as higher borrowing costs in
a French bond auction stoked concern Europe’s debt crisis is
deepening, overshadowing improving economic data in the U.S.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest lender by market value,
slid 2 percent in  Hong Kong .  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665)  sank 5.4 percent
after Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its growth forecast for computer
memory chips.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No.1 oil producer
and the world’s largest mining company, fell 1.6 percent in
Sydney as oil and metal prices declined.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.8 percent to 114.49
as of 7:29 p.m. in  Tokyo , paring gains in the first week of the
year to 0.6 percent. Stocks rose earlier this week as
manufacturing growth in the U.S. and  China  boosted investor
confidence. Gains mostly evaporated in the last two days as
France’s bond sale refocused attention on Europe’s debt burden.  “Europe is going to be a headwind with all the bond
auctions coming up,” said Belinda Allen, a Sydney-based senior
investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $145 billion. “The first bond
auctions from Germany and France did relatively OK, but there’s
a risk Italy won’t perform as well.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slipped 1.2 percent, while
South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 1.1 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.8 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
decreased 1.2 percent.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index added 0.7 percent, erasing
losses of as much as 0.7 percent, on speculation the central
bank will reduce lending curbs.  ‘Tug of War’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent
today. The gauge rose 0.3 percent yesterday in  New York  as
government data showed fewer Americans filed claims for
unemployment insurance last week and ADP Employer Services said
payrolls increased by 325,000 in December. A separate report
showed consumer confidence in the world’s biggest economy rose
to a five-month high.  “We’re likely to see a tug of war in the market between
the bad news in Europe and the good news of improving data in
the  U.S. economy ,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at
Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc.  Asia’s stocks fell today after investors demanded higher
yields at France’s first debt auction of the year. European
countries including Italy and Spain may sell bonds totaling as
much as 262 billion euros ($335 billion) in the first quarter,
according to Deutsche Bank AG forecasts.  HSBC, Sony  Companies that do businesses in Europe declined. HSBC fell
2 percent to HK$59.50 in Hong Kong.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on
the market for a fifth of its sakes, lost 2 percent to 1,345
yen.  Makers of computer memory chips dropped after Nomura cut
its forecast for 2012 growth in global shipments of dynamic
random access memory to 2.7 percent from 3.7 percent.  Elpida, the world’s third-biggest maker of DRAM, sank 5.4
percent to 331 yen in Tokyo.  Powerchip Technology Corp. (5346)  slumped
6.7 percent to 97 Taiwanese cents in Taipei.  Samsung Electronics Co., Asia’s biggest maker of computer
memory chips by sales, slipped 1.4 percent to 1.04 million won
even as the company posted fourth-quarter earnings that beat
analyst estimates.  While smartphone sales helped propel Samsung’s revenue to a
record last year, fourth-quarter operating profit was inflated
by proceeds from the sale of its hard-disk-drive business,  James
Chung , a spokesman for the Suwon, South Korea-based company,
said by telephone after the announcement.  Daewoo Shipbuilding Falls  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  lost 17 percent in 2011 as
China took steps to cool its property market and Europe
struggled to resolve its debt crisis. The S&P 500 Index broke
even for the year and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 11
percent. Stocks in the Asian gauge were valued at 12.1 times
estimated earnings on average as of yesterday, compared with
12.2 times for the S&P 500 and 9.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. dropped 3.1
percent to 23,450 won in Seoul.  Korea Development Bank  plans to
revive the sale of its stake in the shipyard, Kang Man Soo, the
bank’s chief executive officer, said yesterday. The state-run
lender owns 31.3 percent of the shipbuilder, South Korea’s
third-largest.  SK Holdings Co. declined 1.9 percent to 127,000 won. Chey
Tae Won, the chairman of South Korea’s third-largest industrial
group, was indicted on charges that he embezzled funds from
affiliates to cover personal investment losses.  Oil, Metals Drop  Raw-material producers led declines among the 10 industry
group in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index as oil futures in New York
fell 1.4 percent yesterday and the  London Metals Exchange Index (LMEX) ,
which tracks prices of six metals including copper and aluminum,
slid 0.5 percent.  BHP slipped 1.6 to A$35.24.  Glencore International Plc (805) , the
world’s biggest commodities trader, dipped 2.2 percent to
HK$48.15 in Hong Kong. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s largest
producer of the metal, dropped 1.8 percent to HK$16.60.  Chinese oil companies rallied after the government raised
the threshold on a windfall tax paid by crude producers,
effectively reducing the levy.  “This will encourage more offshore China exploration as
well as onshore,” said  Gordon Kwan , the Hong Kong-based head of
regional energy research at Mirae Asset Securities.  PetroChina Co. (857) , Asia’s biggest company by market value,
advanced 2.3 percent to HK$10.62.  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (600028) , Asia’s No. 1 refinery, gained 1.9 percent to HK$8.81.
 Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s largest offshore oil producer, climbed 3
percent to HK$15.08.  To contact the reporter on this story:
