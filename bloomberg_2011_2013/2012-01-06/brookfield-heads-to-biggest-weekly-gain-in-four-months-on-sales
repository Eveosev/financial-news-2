Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3) ,  Brazil ’s
third-largest homebuilder by revenue, posted the biggest weekly
gain in four months after saying contracted sales surpassed its
target for 2011.  Shares added 1.8 percent to 5.55 reais today in Sao Paulo,
extending the weekly gain to 12 percent, the biggest since the
five days ended Sept. 2. The  BM&FBovespa Real Estate (IMOBBV)  Index was
little changed today and added 3.1 percent this week.  Brookfield’s contracted sales rose 21 percent to 4.39
billion reais ($2.38 billion) in the year, while new projects
increased 32 percent to 3.93 billion reais, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday.  “Management did a good job of increasing efforts to speed
up project approvals,” Credit Suisse analysts including
Guilherme Rocha wrote in a note to clients today. The results
“reduce the risks of another guidance revision, at least in the
short term.”  Brookfield lowered its 2011 forecast for new projects to a
range of 3.8 billion to 4.2 billion on Aug. 12, from a previous
estimate of as much as 5.25 billion reais. Brookfield also cut
its 2012 new projects guidance to a range of 4.25 billion reais
to 4.75 billion reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
