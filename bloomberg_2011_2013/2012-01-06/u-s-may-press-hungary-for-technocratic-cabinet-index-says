The U.S. may press Hungary to replace
Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government with a technocratic
Cabinet as the only option to avert a default, Index  reported ,
citing unidentified people involved in U.S. foreign policy.  Tamas Fellegi, Orban’s minister in charge of negotiating a
bailout who will travel to  Washington  for talks with the
 International Monetary Fund  next week, “can say anything but he
won’t be taken seriously,” the Budapest-based news website said
late yesterday.  Orban’s departure is a “nonsensical” idea, the prime
minister’s person being one of the country’s strengths as he is
the only one who can integrate the ruling party, Janos Lazar,
the group’s parliamentary leader, told news website FN24 in an
interview published on Jan. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
