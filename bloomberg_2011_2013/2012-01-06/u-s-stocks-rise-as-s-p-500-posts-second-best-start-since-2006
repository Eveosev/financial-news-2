U.S. stocks (SPX)  rose this week, sending
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its second-best start of a
year since 2006, as reports on manufacturing from America to
China bolstered optimism about the global economy.  Equities fell on the last day of the week after growth in
U.S. jobs failed to lift the S&P 500 above its October high.
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  jumped more than 8.3
percent to lead advances in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) 
during the holiday-shortened week.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  soared 25
percent after reporting online viewing that surpassed an
estimate from BTIG LLC.  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  and  AutoNation Inc. (AN) 
fell more than 8.1 percent to pace declines among retailers.  The  S&P 500  climbed 1.6 percent to 1,277.81 in the first
four trading days of the year, the second-best start in the past
six years after a 2.4 percent gain in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Dow added 1.2 percent, or 142.36
points, to 12,359.92 for the week.  “The pace of growth is slowing but we’re still seeing
corporate growth,”  Peter Jankovskis , who helps manage about
$2.4 billion at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, said in
a phone interview. “The U.S. economy is moving along reasonably
well. When the negative factor of Europe goes away, that comes
back to the fore and allows the markets to move forward.”  Top of Range  Stocks gained during the week after reports showed U.S.
factory output grew in December at the fastest pace in six month
while manufacturing data in China beat economists’ estimates.
The S&P 500 has jumped 16 percent from its 2011 low as better-
than-expected economic data boosted optimism that the world’s
largest economy can weather Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. The
rally has brought the index toward the top of a trading range it
has been stuck in since August and pushed the  Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) , a gauge of market fear, to
20.63, the lowest level since July.  The S&P 500 snapped a three-day gain on Dec. 6 even after
figures from the Labor Department showed payroll growth in
December beat forecasts and the unemployment rate dropped to the
lowest level in almost three years. A report showing German
factory orders had the biggest drop in almost three years
spurred concern that Europe was headed into a recession.  Raw-materials producers (SPXL1)  and financial shares led the S&P
500’s gain during the week, jumping 3.8 percent and 3.1 percent
as a group, respectively. Bank of America rallied 11 percent to
$6.18 amid speculation the U.S. may introduce a new mortgage
refinancing program. A government official, who asked for
anonymity, denied that the White House is considering a
trillion-dollar plan to refinance home loans.  Latin American Farmers  Monsanto Co. (MON)  surged 11 percent to $77.51. The world’s
largest seed company posted first-quarter earnings that exceeded
estimates because of demand from Latin American farmers. U.S.
orders are ahead of last year, Monsanto said.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , due to start the earnings season on Jan. 9,
added 5.9 percent to $9.16. The biggest U.S. aluminum producer
may say it lost 1 cent a share in the fourth quarter, according
to the average estimate from analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Microsoft, the software maker that’s scheduled to report
results on Jan. 19, climbed 8.3 percent to $28.11.  S&P 500 companies, which beat analysts’ estimates in the
previous 11 quarters, are forecast to report a 6 percent
increase in per-share profit during the September-December
period, according to projections compiled by Bloomberg. That
would mark the slowest growth since the third quarter of 2009.  Online Viewing  Netflix surged 25 percent to $86.29 for the biggest gain in
the S&P 500. The owner of the streaming and DVD-by-mail service
said its online customers watched more than 2 billion hours of
content in the last three months of 2011.  Rich Greenfield , an
analyst with BTIG, estimated 1.2 billion hours.  AutoNation posted the  biggest loss (SPX)  on the S&P 500, sinking
9.3 percent to $33.44. Edward Lampert’s hedge fund cut its stake
in the auto retailer to 52.5 percent from 56.4 percent,
according to a regulatory filing.  Sears fell 8.1 percent to $29.20, extending its slump for a
fifth week. The largest U.S. department store chain had its debt
rating cut by S&P and Moody’s Investors Service on deteriorating
earnings.  “What U.S. investors are focused on are three exogenous
variables: the sovereign debt mess in  Europe , the prospect of
slower growth out of emerging markets and the policy dysfunction
that we’re dealing with in Washington,”  Philip Orlando , the New
York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors
Inc., said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees about
$355 billion. “If those issues didn’t exist, the S&P 500 would
be at something like 1,800, because of this improvement in
domestic economic fundamentals that we’ve seen.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
