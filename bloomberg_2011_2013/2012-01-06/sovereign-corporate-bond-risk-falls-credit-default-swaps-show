The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments jumped eight basis points to 383 at 3 p.m. in
London, approaching the record 385 set Nov. 25. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 3.5 basis points to 293.5 and
the subordinated index rose two to 530, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 0.5
basis points to 757. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 1.25 basis points
to 178.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
