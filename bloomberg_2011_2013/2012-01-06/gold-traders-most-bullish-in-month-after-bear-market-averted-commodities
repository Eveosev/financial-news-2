Gold traders are the most bullish in
a month as  Europe ’s deepening debt crisis and increasing
tensions over Iran drove the metal to its longest winning streak
since October.  Ten of 22 surveyed by Bloomberg expect the metal to gain
next week and five were neutral, the highest proportion since
Dec. 9. The  U.S. Mint  sold 45,500 ounces of American Eagle gold
coins this month, compared with 65,500 ounces in the whole of
December and 41,000 in November, data on its website showed.  Britain and  France  will press the European Union to stop
Iranian crude imports at a Jan. 30 meeting, in response to the
country’s nuclear program. Iran is threatening to retaliate by
blocking the  Strait of Hormuz , a key chokepoint for global oil
supplies. Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  warned his nation
may face economic collapse as soon as March. Investors are
 holding (.GLDTONS)  a near-record amount of gold through exchange-traded
products after the metal rose for an 11th consecutive year.  “European sovereign-debt risk and the geopolitical risk of
the Iranian situation escalating should support gold,” said
Mark O’Byrne, executive director of Dublin-based GoldCore Ltd.,
a brokerage that sells everything from quarter-ounce British
Sovereigns to 400-ounce bars. “Gold’s safe-haven attributes
will continue to be in demand.”  Annual Gain  Bullion rose 10 percent last year, beating the 1.2 percent
decline in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24
commodities and the 9.4 percent retreat in the MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities. Treasuries returned 9.8 percent last
year, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  The metal, which traded at $1,618.28 an ounce at 5:45 p.m.
in London, fell almost 19 percent from its record closing price
of $1,900.23 on Sept. 5 through Dec. 29, within 1 percentage
point of the common definition of a  bear market . Gold rallied
5 percent in five days ended yesterday, the longest run of gains
since October.  Traders also anticipate advances in raw sugar, corn and
soybeans next week. Copper may decline, the surveys showed.  Holdings in bullion-backed ETPS reached 2,355.3 metric tons
on Jan. 4, within 2 percent of the all-time high set Dec. 13,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The hoard, valued at $121.7
billion, exceeds the reserves of all but four central banks.  Money Managers  Hedge funds  and other money managers cut  bets (.MMGCNET)  on higher
prices to 111,919 futures and options in the week ended Dec. 27,
the lowest since January 2009, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. The drop preceded the rally in prices. The
last time the net-long position was that low, prices climbed
about 16 percent in the next four weeks.  The U.S. and its allies are tightening restrictions on
 Iran , accusing it of a covert plan to build nuclear weapons, a
charge Iran’s government denies. About one in six barrels of oil
traded worldwide flows through the Strait of Hormuz between
Iran and Oman, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.  Brent crude  may rally 11 percent to $125 a barrel should
the EU ban imports of Iranian oil, according to Societe Generale
SA. Some investors buy gold as a hedge against faster inflation,
which may quicken if oil prices advance.  Greece ’s Papademos is racing to complete a voluntary swap
of debt with private bondholders, part of the new rescue plan
for the country which also includes 130 billion euros ($167
billion) of public funds. France’s credit outlook was lowered by
 Fitch Ratings  on Dec. 16 on the “heightened risk of contingent
liabilities” from the escalating euro-region crisis.  Standard &
Poor’s  is reviewing the ratings of France and  Germany .  ‘Liquidity Dries Up’  “If the debt crisis blows up it could affect banking
liquidity, and if liquidity dries up, all commodities, even
gold, will fall,” said Marc Ground, a commodities strategist at
Standard Bank Plc in Johannesburg.  A weakening rupee is also driving up prices in  India , the
biggest consumer, damping demand. Imports may drop 48 percent to
150 tons in the first quarter from a year earlier,  Prithviraj Kothari , president of the Bombay Bullion Association, said Jan.
3. Imports fell to 875 tons to 880 tons last year from 958 tons
in 2010, he said.  Turkey  bought about 41.3 tons of gold for official reserves
in November, data from the International Monetary Fund shows.
Central banks may buy 600 tons this year, according to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. Combined official holdings stand at 30,744
tons, data from the London-based World Gold Council show.  Buying Gold  The banks were also buying gold in 1980 as prices rose to a
then-record $850, only to drop for most of the next 20 years.
Bullion tripled from 1999 through the beginning of 2008 as the
banks sold more than 4,000 tons. Bullion may reach $2,140 this
year, according to 44 analysts, traders and investors surveyed
by Bloomberg at the end of 2011.  Nine of 17 traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expect copper to fall next week. The metal for delivery in three
months, the  London  Metal Exchange’s benchmark contract, declined
21 percent last year and was at $7,567.25 a ton.  Raw sugar retreated 27 percent last year and was at 23.2
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Eleven of 13
people surveyed expect prices to climb next week.  Ten of 20 anticipate higher corn prices, while nine of 21
said soybeans will advance. Corn rose 2.8 percent last year and
was at $6.46 a bushel in  Chicago . Soybeans were at $12.0725 a
bushel after sliding 14 percent in 2011.  “We’ve still got significant hurdles to be jumped in the
next couple of months,” Peter Hickson, a commodities strategist
at UBS AG, said in an interview yesterday on Bloomberg
Television’s “First Look.” “Some time toward the end of the
first quarter into the second quarter I think people will become
more optimistic about the second half of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
