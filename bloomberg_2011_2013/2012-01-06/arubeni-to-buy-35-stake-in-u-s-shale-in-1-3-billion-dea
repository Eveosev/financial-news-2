Marubeni Corp. (8002) , Japan’s biggest grain
trading company, agreed to buy a 35 percent stake in shale oil
and gas acreage in the U.S. from Hunt Oil Co. in a $1.3 billion
deal that includes future drilling costs.  The Tokyo-based company will acquire 52,000 net acres in
the Eagle Ford area in Texas, Marubeni said in a statement on
its website today. The company and Hunt plan to drill “several
hundred” wells in the area over the next five to 10 years,
according to the statement.  Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Reliance
Industries Ltd. have gained access to U.S. shale assets, which
the Energy Information Administration estimates can more than
double the world’s gas reserves.  Japan ’s trading companies are
boosting investments in new types of oil and gas assets to help
reduce the country’s reliance on Middle Eastern supplies.  Marubeni and Dallas-based Hunt agreed they would acquire
more shale acreage in the Eagle Ford area, according to the
statement.  Marubeni fell 1 percent to 474 yen in  Tokyo  compared with a
1.2 percent decline in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.
The stock dropped 18 percent last year.  Japan, which buys almost all its energy needs from
overseas, boosted imports of liquefied natural gas after the
March earthquake and tsunami knocked out nuclear reactors at
Fukushima.  Marubeni is involved in oil and gas projects in the  Gulf of
Mexico ,  North Sea ,  India  and Qatar, according to the statement.
Itochu Corp., Japan’s third-largest trading company, said in
October 2010 it would invest $390 million to buy a 25 percent
stake in about 88,000 acres of the Niobrara oil shale reserve in
southeastern Wyoming from Fidelity Exploration & Production Co.  The U.S. overtook Russia in 2010 as the world’s largest gas
producer as output from shale rose. Gas trapped in shale
formations will provide 24 percent of all U.S. natural gas
consumption in 2035, according to the Department of Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
