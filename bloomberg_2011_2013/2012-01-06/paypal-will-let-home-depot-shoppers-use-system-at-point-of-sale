EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal division plans to
announce a partnership with  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  that lets shoppers
use the payment system at checkout, taking aim at  Visa Inc. (V)  and
 MasterCard Inc. (MA) ’s credit card-swiping customers.  The agreement marks the company’s first retail partnership
that allows payment on in-store terminals, said Anuj Nayar, a
spokesman for the PayPal. Until now, the company has focused on
e-commerce transactions.  PayPal, one of the fastest-growing parts of EBay, is trying
to maintain its expansion by challenging traditional payment
systems. The company is developing a so-called mobile wallet,
which could be stored on a consumer’s smartphone or a special
PayPal card, letting shoppers pay for items at checkout. The
Home Depot project will roll out to consumers later this year,
serving as a test project.  “Home Depot has a significant reach,” said  Brian Blair ,
an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp. in  New York . “PayPal has
been historically in online payments. Now it becomes real-world
currency.”  A small number of PayPal employees are already testing the
Home Depot payment system at five stores, Nayar said.  The idea of the mobile wallet is to store credit- and
debit-card information from a range of providers, with PayPal
controlling the experience. The company plans to give customers
the option to choose which provider they want to use up to 30
days after the sale.  Management Change  As it pushes into new markets, PayPal also is seeking a new
leader. Former President Scott Thompson announced this week that
he’ll become chief executive officer at Yahoo! Inc., the
struggling Web portal. Under his management, PayPal more than
doubled revenue and boosted its user base to more than 100
million.  PayPal first gained popularity as a way for smaller
merchants to accept payment without the expense or hassle of
processing credit cards. It has since enlisted major retailers,
including  Target Corp. (TGT)  and  J. Crew Group Inc. (JCG) , which use it for
e-commerce orders.  “Any additional place and meaningful retailer that you can
use PayPal is a really, really good thing for PayPal,” Wedge
Partners’ Blair said.  Shoppers on EBay’s marketplace frequently use the payment
service, and an expansion into real-world retail would give them
a chance to use their accounts more broadly, he said.  “Just EBay’s global users alone would like an extra place
to use their dollars,” Blair said. “What will be interesting
to see is if non-EBay users think PayPal works for them.”  Shares of EBay, based in  San Jose , California, were little
changed in yesterday’s trading at $30.63. The stock gained 9
percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
