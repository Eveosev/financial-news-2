Payroll growth in the U.S. beat
forecasts in December and the  unemployment rate  dropped to the
lowest level in almost three years as the economy gained
strength heading into 2012.  The 200,000 increase followed a revised 100,000 gain in
November that was smaller than first estimated, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. The jobless rate
unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent, while hours worked and
earnings climbed.  “You got the trifecta -- more people working, wages up and
the average work week up,” said  Stuart Hoffman , chief economist
at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in Pittsburgh, who
accurately forecast the December payrolls gain. “You can’t
really argue that that isn’t a sign of significant improvement
in the job market.”  Sustained hiring is needed to support the household
spending that accounts for about 70 percent of the world’s
largest economy. Today’s report follows gains in  manufacturing (NAPMPMI) 
and  consumer sentiment (CONCCONF)  that suggest the U.S. is withstanding the
economic crisis in  Europe .  Stocks and Treasury yields fell after William C. Dudley,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York , said the
outlook for unemployment remains “unacceptably high” relative
to the Fed’s goals. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.3
percent to 1,277.77 at 1:15 p.m. in New York. The yield on the
10-year Treasury note fell to 1.96 percent from 2 percent late
yesterday.  Payrolls were forecast to rise by 155,000 in December,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. Regular monthly revisions subtracted a total of
8,000 jobs from payrolls in October and November.  Separate Survey  The unemployment rate, derived from a separate survey of
households, was forecast to climb to 8.7 percent from a
previously reported 8.6 percent in November. The November rate
was revised to 8.7 percent.  Private hiring, which excludes government agencies, rose
212,000 after a revised gain of 120,000 in November. It was
projected to climb by 178,000, the survey showed.  Retail trade payrolls climbed 27,900 as companies kept
hiring for the  holiday shopping season . Among companies planning
to take on more staff as consumer demand strengthens is  Fort
Worth , Texas-based  Pier 1 Imports Inc. (PIR)   “Sales are robust, merchandise margins are strong,
operating margins are growing,” Chief Executive Officer
Alexander Smith said on a Dec. 15 conference call with analysts.
“There’s going to be a little more hiring in the first part of
the year without a doubt.”  Payroll-Tax Cut  President  Barack Obama  said the jobs report shows the
economy is healing, and he appealed to lawmakers to extend a
payroll-tax cut through the rest of the year to assure growth
continues.  “We’re starting to rebound,” Obama said at the offices of
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington. “We’re
creating jobs on a consistent basis.”  Employment at service providers increased 152,000, with a
50,200 advance in the  transportation industry .  United Parcel
Service Inc. (UPS)  said in November that it planned to hire 55,000
holiday workers this year, a 10 percent increase from 2010, to
help with shipping gains tied to online shopping.  Last month’s gain in transportation jobs was the biggest
since September 1997. In December 2010, a 50,100 gain in the
industry’s payrolls was almost entirely reversed a month later.  Payroll increases got “some help from temporary factors,”
which also included milder weather that probably boosted hiring
by construction companies, Bruce Kasman, chief economist for
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, said on a conference call.
Builders added 17,000 workers last month.  Wal-Mart  Other companies also saw increased demand during the
holidays. Same-store sales at U.S. retailers excluding Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. rose 3.5 percent in December from a year earlier,
according to figures yesterday from the  International Council of
Shopping Centers .  In the final three months of 2011, “clear signs emerged
that U.S. consumers are more confident and that other
underpinnings of our economy are either stable or slowly
improving,”  Don Johnson , vice president of U.S. sales for
Detroit-based  General Motors Co. (GM) , said on a Jan. 4 conference
call.  Factory payrolls (USMMMNCH)  increased by 23,000, the strongest since
July, after a 1,000 gain in the previous month. Manufacturing
job growth last year was the strongest since 1997.  Gains among private employers were partly offset by cuts in
government payrolls, which decreased by 12,000 in December.  Little Headway  For all of 2011, employers added 1.64 million workers, the
best year for the American worker since 2006, after a 940,000
increase in 2010. Even with the gains, little headway has been
made in recovering the 8.75 million jobs lost as a result of the
recession that ended in June 2009.  “The tide is beginning to come back in,”  James Glassman ,
senior economist at  JP Morgan Chase  in New York, said in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken
Prewitt. “We’ve got a long way to go. This is all positive,
though, that we’re actually moving forward, and that’s an
important trend.”  The New York Fed’s Dudley, in a speech today to bankers in
Iselin,  New Jersey , said the central bank still needs to
consider monetary-policy easing.  “Because the outlook for unemployment is unacceptably high
relative to our dual mandate and the outlook for inflation is
moderate, I believe it is also appropriate to continue to
evaluate whether we could provide additional accommodation in a
manner that produces more benefits than costs,” Dudley said.  Hourly Earnings  Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent to $23.24, today’s
report showed. The average workweek for all workers increased
six minutes to 34.4 hours.  The so-called underemployment rate -- which includes part-
time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and people who
want work but have given up looking -- decreased to 15.2 percent
from 15.6 percent.  Annual benchmark revisions to the household survey showed
the unemployment rate averaged 8.9 percent in 2011, down from
9.6 percent and 9.3 percent in the previous two years. It still
marked the worst three-year period since 1939 to 1941.  The report also showed a decrease in long-term unemployed
Americans. The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more
fell as a percentage of all jobless, to 42.5 percent from 43.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
