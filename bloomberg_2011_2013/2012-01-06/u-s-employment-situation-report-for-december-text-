Following is the text of the
December employment report from the Labor Department.  THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- DECEMBER 2011  Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 200,000 in December, and
the unemployment rate, at 8.5 percent, continued to trend
down, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Job
gains occurred in transportation and warehousing, retail
trade, manufacturing, health care, and mining.  Revision of Seasonally Adjusted Household Survey Data  Seasonally adjusted household survey data have been revised
using updated seasonal adjustment factors, a procedure done
at the end of each calendar year. Seasonally adjusted
estimates back to January 2007 were subject to revision. The
unemployment rates for January 2011 through November 2011 (as
originally published and as revised) appear in table A,
along with additional information about the revisions.  Household Survey Data  Both the number of unemployed persons (13.1 million) and the
unemployment rate (8.5 percent) continued to trend down in
December. The unemployment rate has declined by 0.6 percentage
point since August.  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for adult
men decreased to 8.0 percent in December. The jobless rates
for adult women (7.9 percent), teenagers (23.1 percent),
whites (7.5 percent), blacks (15.8 percent), and Hispanics
(11.0 percent) showed little change. The jobless rate for
Asians was 6.8 percent, not seasonally adjusted.  The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks
or more) was little changed at 5.6 million and accounted for
42.5 percent of the unemployed.  The civilian  labor force  participation rate (64.0 percent) and
the employment-population ratio (58.5 percent) were both
unchanged over the month.  The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons
(sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers)
declined by 371,000 to 8.1 million in December. These
individuals were working part time because their hours had
been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time
job.  About 2.5 million persons were marginally attached to the
labor force in December, little different from a year earlier.
(The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were
not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work,
and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They
were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched
for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 945,000 discouraged
workers in December, a decrease of 373,000 from a year
earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged
workers are persons not currently looking for work because
they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.6
million persons marginally attached to the labor force in
December had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding
the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family
responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 200,000 in
December. Over the past 12 months, nonfarm payroll employment
has risen by 1.6 million. Employment in the private sector
rose by 212,000 in December and by 1.9 million over the year.
Government employment changed little over the month but fell
by 280,000 over the year.  Employment in transportation and warehousing rose sharply in
December (+50,000). Almost all of the gain occurred in the
couriers and messengers industry (+42,000); seasonal hiring
was particularly strong in December.  Retail trade continued to add jobs in December, with a gain of
28,000. Employment in the industry has increased by 240,000
over the past 12 months. Over the month, job gains continued
in general merchandise stores (+13,000) and in clothing and
clothing accessories stores (+11,000). Employment in sporting
goods, hobby, book, and music stores fell by 10,000.  In December, manufacturing employment expanded by 23,000,
following 4 months of little change. Employment increased in
December in transportation equipment (+9,000), fabricated
metals (+6,000), and machinery (+5,000).  Mining employment rose by 7,000 over the month. Over the year,
mining added 89,000 jobs.  Health care continued to add jobs in December (+23,000);
employment in hospitals increased by 10,000. Over the year,
health care employment has risen by 315,000.  Within leisure and hospitality, employment in food services
and drinking places continued to trend up in December
(+24,000). Over the year, food services and drinking places
has added 230,000 jobs.  Construction employment changed little in December. Within the
industry, nonresidential specialty trade contractors added
20,000 jobs over the month, mostly offsetting losses over the
prior 2 months.  Employment in professional and business services changed
little in December for the second month in a row. The industry
added 42,000 jobs per month, on average, during the first 10
months of 2011.  Government employment changed little in December but was down
by 280,000 over the year. Job losses in 2011 occurred in local
government; state government, excluding education; and the
U.S. Postal Service.  The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm
payrolls increased by 0.1 hour to 34.4 hours in December. The
manufacturing workweek increased by 0.1 hour to 40.5 hours.
Factory overtime decreased by 0.1 hour to 3.2 hours. The
average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees
on private nonfarm payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.7
hours.  In December, average hourly earnings for all employees on
private nonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$23.24. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have
increased by 2.1 percent. In December, average hourly earnings
of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees were
unchanged at $19.54.  The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for October was
revised from +100,000 to +112,000, and the change for November
was revised from +120,000 to +100,000.  __________
