Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF)  and
 Shoppers Stop Ltd. (SHOP) , the nation’s biggest retailers, gained the
most in six weeks after an official said the government will
this month conclude talks with stakeholders on allowing foreign
investment in multibrand retail.  “The government is in talks with farmers and traders over
the issue of FDI in multibrand retail,” P.K. Chaudhery,
secretary in the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion,
told reporters in New Delhi today. “Consultations with these
stakeholders are likely to be completed by the month end.”  India on Dec. 7 put on hold a decision to allow companies
such as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  to own as much as 51
percent of retailers selling more than one brand. The move
followed political protests, and sent the benchmark stock index
to its biggest three-day drop since July 2009.  Pantaloon, the nation’s largest retailer,  surged (PF)  6.6
percent to 141.45 rupees at the close of trading in Mumbai
today. Shoppers Stop gained 5.6 percent to 278.25 rupees.
The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.1 percent.  Chaudhery said India will “issue a notification soon” to
permit 100 percent foreign direct investment in single brand
retail.  A notification involves publishing a rule in the Gazette of
India, the official record of government laws.  For Related News and Information:
