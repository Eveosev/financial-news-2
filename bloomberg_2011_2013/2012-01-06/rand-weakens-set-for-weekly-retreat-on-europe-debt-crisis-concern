The rand strengthened against the
dollar for the first time in three days, paring its decline this
week, after a fall in U.S. jobless rate to a three-year low
fueled optimism the world’s biggest economy is recovering.  South Africa ’s currency appreciated as much as 0.7 percent,
and traded 0.6 percent stronger at 8.1203 per dollar as of 3:49
p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand has slipped 0.4 percent against
the dollar this week, its first weekly decline in three.
 AngloGold Ashanti  rose 0.67 percent, reversing its 1.8 percent
drop yesterday.  Hiring in the U.S. may help fuel consumer spending,
boosting demand for metals and other commodities, which account
for as much as 60 percent of South Africa’s exports. The
 Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of raw materials gained as the
prices of metals including copper and platinum rose, boosting
shares in South Africa’s mining companies.  “Lower unemployment in the U.S. is good for  consumer
spending , good for commodities, and good for South Africa,” Ian Cruickshanks, head of treasury strategic research at
Johannesburg-based Nedbank Group Ltd., said by phone. “There is
a general feel-good atmosphere, which takes the risk-on theme a
bit further, and that is good for  emerging markets  and for the
rand.”  U.S. employers added 200,000 jobs in December, double the
revised 100,000 in November and more than the 155,000 median
estimate of economist in a Bloomberg survey. The  unemployment
rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent, the lowest since February
2009, labor department data showed.  South Africa’s 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 gained, driving
the yield down two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
6.85 percent. The yield has climbed 10 basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
