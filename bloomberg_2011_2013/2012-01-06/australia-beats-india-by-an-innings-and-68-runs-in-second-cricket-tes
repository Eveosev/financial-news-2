Australia  beat India by an innings
and 68 runs in the second cricket Test in Sydney to take a 2-0
lead in their four-match series.  Australia, which had secured a 468-run first innings lead
following captain  Michael Clarke ’s record-setting 329 not out,
bowled out the touring team for 400 in its second innings after
tea on day four.  India reached 271-3 before losing its last seven wickets
for 129 runs at the Sydney Cricket Ground.  Ben Hilfenhaus  led
Australia’s bowlers with 5-106, while Clarke sparked the
collapse by dismissing  Sachin Tendulkar  for 80.  Australia won the opening match in  Melbourne  by 122 runs to
end an eight-Test winless streak against  India , which has never
won a series in Australia. The third Test starts Jan. 13 in
Perth before the final match in Adelaide.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
