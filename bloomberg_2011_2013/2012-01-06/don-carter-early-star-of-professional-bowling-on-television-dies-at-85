Don Carter, who helped bowling
achieve a prime spot on television in the 1950s and was once
named the game’s greatest player, died last night at his home in
Miami. He was 85.  Carter, a native of  St. Louis , had been hospitalized with
pneumonia complicated by emphysema, the Professional Bowlers
Association said in a statement.  Carter said he was introduced to bowling when his mother
saved up to allow him to play one game for his 13th birthday. He
called it “the biggest birthday present of my life.”  After helping found the PBA in 1958, Carter won five major
championships and was picked as the “Greatest Bowler of All
Time” by Bowling Magazine in 1970.  He was a regular on such TV sports shows as “Jackpot
Bowling” and “Make that Spare,” and was the first U.S.
athlete to sign a $1 million sports-marketing contract, with
Ebonite, a bowling-ball manufacturer, in 1964, the PBA said. He
retired in 1972 and later appeared in commercials for Miller’s
Lite beer brand.  Carter had been married to Paula Sperber, another Hall of
Fame bowler. The PBA said details on memorial services were
pending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
