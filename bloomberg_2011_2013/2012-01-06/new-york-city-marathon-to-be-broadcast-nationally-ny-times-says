The New York City marathon will be
broadcast live across the U.S. for the first time in nearly two
decades as part of a five-year deal, the New York Times
reported.  The Nov. 4 race will be carried for 3 1/2 hours on ESPN2,
which reaches nearly every household with cable or satellite
television, and for five hours on ABCâ€™s affiliate in the New
York area, the report said.  The race was last broadcast live and nationally in 1993,
the last year ABC televised the event, the Times said.  The marathon, the largest in the country, had more than
47,000 entrants last year and is expected to expand to about
55,000 runners in coming years, the newspaper said.  Race organizer the  New York Road Runners  may announce the
accord today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
