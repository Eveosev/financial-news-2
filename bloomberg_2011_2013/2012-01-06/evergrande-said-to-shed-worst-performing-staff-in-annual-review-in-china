Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) 
plans to shed its worst-performing employees in its annual
review of its workforce, where it typically cuts 3 percent to 5
percent of its staff, according to a company official who asked
not to be identified.  The job cuts aren’t related to market conditions and it’s
still recruiting at university campuses, the person said,
responding to media reports that it’s firing 30 percent of its
employees this year.   To contact the reporter on this story:
