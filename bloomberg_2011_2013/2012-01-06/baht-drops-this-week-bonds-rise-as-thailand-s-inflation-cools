Thailand ’s baht had a second
consecutive weekly decline and government bonds rose after
 inflation (THCPIYOY)  cooled to a nine-month low.  Consumer prices increased 3.53 percent in December from a
year earlier, the least since March 2011, according to official
data released on Jan. 4. The baht halted two days of declines
after data yesterday showed that private employers in the U.S.
added 325,000 workers to payrolls in December, more than
economists forecast.  “Asian currencies have been under downward pressure on
 Europe ’s lingering debt crisis,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader
at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “We have seen
solid U.S. data, which lends some support.”  The baht weakened 0.3 percent this week to 31.65 per dollar
as of 3:04 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency was little changed from yesterday. It
may trade between 31.50 and 31.80 next week, Hasegawa said.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 slid 15
basis points from a week ago, the most since the five days ended
Dec. 2, to 3.05 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate declined nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
