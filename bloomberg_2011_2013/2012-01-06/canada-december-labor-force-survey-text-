Following is the text of
 Canada 's labor force survey released by Statistics Canada.  Following two months of declines, employment rose
slightly in December, up 18,000. The unemployment rate
edged up to 7.5% as more people participated in the labour
market. Over the past 12 months, employment growth
totalled 1.2% (+199,000), with nearly all of the gains in
the first half of the year.  Employment  The employment growth of 1.2% from December 2010 to
December 2011 followed an increase of 1.8% between
December 2009 and December 2010.  In December, an increase of 43,000 in part-time work
was partially offset by a decline of 26,000 in full-time
employment. Compared with 12 months earlier, the number of
part-time workers was little changed, while full-time
employment was up 1.5% (+208,000). Over the same period,
the total number of hours worked increased by 1.4%.  Among the provinces, employment increased in British
Columbia, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador,
Saskatchewan,  New Brunswick  and Prince  Edward Island  in
December. In contrast, employment declined in Quebec,
while there was little change in the other provinces.  There were notable employment gains in manufacturing
for the month, while there were declines in utilities. All
other industries showed little employment change.  There were 31,000 more self-employed workers in
December. Compared with 12 months earlier, self-employment
was up 2.0%, while the number of private sector employees
rose 1.3%, and the number of public sector workers was
unchanged.  Employment increased in December among people aged 55
and over. At the same time, there was a decline among
youths aged 15 to 24, and little change for people aged 25
to 54.  Unemployment rate   Manufacturing employment up in December  Following declines in recent months, employment in
manufacturing increased by 30,000 in December. At the same
time, employment was down 7,200 in utilities, and was
little changed in the other industries.  Since December 2010, overall employment in the goods
sector has changed little. While there was notable growth
in natural resources (+7.5%) and construction (+3.1%),
there were offsetting declines in utilities (-9.5%) and
manufacturing (-2.8%).  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in the
service sector was up 1.5% (+194,000). Over this period,
there was notable growth in accommodation and food
services (+6.2%); professional, scientific and technical
services (+6.0%); "other services" (+4.3%); and health
care and social assistance (+2.9%). At the same time,
there were declines in finance, insurance, real estate and
leasing (-2.8%).  Provincial summary  Employment in British Columbia rose by 11,000 in
December. Over the previous 12 months, employment in the
province grew 1.4% (+32,000), slightly above the national
average of 1.2%.  Nova Scotia 's employment increased for a second
consecutive month in December, up 4,300. The unemployment
rate fell 0.8 percentage points to 7.8%, the lowest since
October 2008. Over the past 12 months, employment has
risen 2.3% (+11,000) in the province.  In December, employment was up 3,200 in Newfoundland
and Labrador, bringing growth over the previous 12 months
to 1.9% (+4,300).  In Saskatchewan, employment rose by 3,100. Employment
in the province was up 0.7% (+3,700) compared with
December 2010.  Employment increased by 2,900 in New Brunswick,
returning to its level of 12 months earlier.  In Ontario, employment edged up by 16,000, bringing
growth since December 2010 to 1.4% (+91,000). The
unemployment rate in the province was 7.7% in December,
down 0.2 percentage points from a month earlier.  Employment in  Quebec  decreased for a third consecutive
month, down 26,000 in December. As a result, the
unemployment rate rose 0.7 percentage points to 8.7%.
Compared with a year earlier, employment in Quebec was
down 1.3% (-51,000).  While employment in  Alberta  was little changed in
December, it grew 4.9% (+99,000) over the year, entirely
in full-time work.  Employment gains among older workers  In December, employment grew by 24,000 among people
aged 55 and over. Employment for this age group was up
3.4% (+102,000) compared with 12 months earlier. This
increase was almost entirely due to the aging of the
population, as the number of people aged 55 and over grew
by 3.2% over the period.  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 declined for the
third consecutive month, down 17,000 in December. With
this decline, youth employment was 12,000 below its level
of 12 months earlier (-0.5%).  Employment among people aged 25 to 54 was little
changed in December, and growth for this group was 0.9%
(+109,000) compared with December 2010.  Quarterly update for the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
information about the territories. This information is
produced monthly in the form of three-month moving
averages. Not all estimates are seasonally adjusted;
therefore, comparisons should only be made on a year-over-
year basis.  Employment in Yukon rose by 1,500 (+8.4%) from the
fourth quarter of 2010 to the same period in 2011.
Employment was little changed in both the  Northwest
Territories  and Nunavut.  In the fourth quarter of 2011, the unemployment rate
was 4.9% in Yukon, 7.9% in the Northwest Territories and
14.9% in Nunavut.  Note to readers  Annual average estimates for 2011 are now available on
CANSIM (tables 282-0001 to 282-0121).  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will
have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates, and how to use standard errors
to assess this variability, consult the "Data quality"
section of the publication Labour Force Information (71-
001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  Statistics Canada  is moving to one release time, 8:30
a.m., for all data releases in The Daily. This will mean a
change in the release time for the LFS, which is currently
7:00 a.m. This change will be implemented with the release
of LFS data on April 5, 2012.  Revision  Seasonally adjusted estimates from the LFS will be
revised using the latest seasonal factors, going back
three years (January 2009 onwards). The revised data will
be available on CANSIM (tables 282-0087 to 282-0094, 282-
0100, 282-0116 and 282-0117) on January 27, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
