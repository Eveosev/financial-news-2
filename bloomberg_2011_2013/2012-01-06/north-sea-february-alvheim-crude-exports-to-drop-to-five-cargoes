for February will drop to five cargoes of 780,000 barrels each,
one less than this month, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  Shipments will total 3.9 million barrels, or 134,483
barrels a day, compared with 150,968 barrels a day this month,
according to the plan.  Houston-based Marathon Oil Corp. operates the  field  in the

crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
