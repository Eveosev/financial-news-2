Peru’s benchmark sol-denominated
bonds headed for their biggest weekly gain in a month on bets
rising metal exports and faster economic growth will spur gains
in the local currency.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell six basis points this
week, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.69 percent at 1:20 p.m.
Lima time, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s
price rose 0.43 centimo to 114.42 centimos per sol, the biggest
weekly advance since the five days ended Dec. 2. The price was
little changed in trading today.  Investors hunting for yield in  emerging markets  are seeking
out sol-denominated securities after the currency outperformed
Latin American peers last year. Peru’s growth outlook and the
central bank’s moves to reduce swings in the sol by buying or
selling dollars is luring investors, said  Enrique Alvarez , the
head of  Latin America  fixed income research at IdeaGlobal in  New
York .  “Investors are very content to come in and take what yield
they can locally,” Alvarez said. “There’s very little
likelihood that you’re going to see big volatility or a big
reversal in the sol.”  The sol strengthened 3.9 percent last year, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. That’s the best performance among
six major Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The currency was little changed today at 2.6940 per  U.S.
dollar , from 2.6948 yesterday, according to the bank. It
strengthened 0.1 percent this week.  Peru, the world’s third-largest copper and zinc producer,
will probably grow 5.5 percent this year, one of the fastest
rates in the region, while exports rise to $48 billion from $43
billion in 2011, Cabinet Chief Oscar Valdes said yesterday.  The economy probably expanded 6.8 percent last year, the
central bank said Dec. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
