HTC Corp. (2498) ,  Asia ’s second-largest
smartphone maker, posted its first  quarterly profit decline (2498)  in
two years as competing models from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Samsung
Electronics Co. damped demand for its handsets.  Fourth-quarter net income dropped 26 percent to NT$11
billion ($364 million) from NT$14.8 billion a year earlier, the
Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company said in a statement today. The
average of 11 analyst  estimates (2498)  compiled by Bloomberg in the
past four weeks was for profit of NT$11.6 billion.  Analysts predict sales and shipments will fall further this
quarter after the company cut its outlook for revenue in the
last three months of 2011. Sales of HTC handsets, including the
Sensation, Wildfire and Rhyme, slowed in the fourth quarter as
customers opted for Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy models,
and the weaker global economy hurt overall demand.  “Severe competition at the high end from Apple and Samsung
forced their sales lower during the quarter,” said Peter Liao,
a Taipei-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Plc. which has a
“neutral”  rating (2498)  on the stock. “The key is when they can find
their competitive edge, which may not happen until the second
quarter at the earliest.”  Fourth-quarter revenue fell 2.5 percent from a year earlier
to NT$101.4 billion, missing the NT$103.3 billion average of 11
analyst  estimates (2498) . Operating margin, which tracks the percentage
of sales less operating costs, dropped to 12.8 percent,
according to Bloomberg calculations, the lowest in at least
three years.  Shipments, Sales  Shipments dropped to 10 million units and will decline to
8.5 million this quarter, according to the median of five
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. HTC sold 13.2
million units in the third quarter and didn’t provide shipment
data or estimates for the current or prior quarter.  Sales will fall to NT$85.9 billion in the current three-
month period, according to the average of eight estimates.  Chief Financial Officer Winston Yung didn’t immediately
answer phone calls today.  HTC, which became the largest smartphone seller in the U.S.
in the third quarter, on Oct. 31 forecast that fourth-quarter
sales would rise as much as 30 percent from a year earlier. It
then cut its outlook on Nov. 23, saying revenue would be little
changed.  HTC fell 0.7 percent to close at NT$482 in Taipei trading
before the announcement. The shares declined 42 percent  last
year (2498)  and have fallen 61 percent from their April 28 record as
analysts cut their ratings on the stock, citing stiffer
competition.  HTC may unveil handsets featuring high-speed, fourth-
generation wireless chips next month, boosting the shares, Alvin Kwock, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst in  Hong Kong , wrote in a
Jan. 3 report.  The brokerage is one of nine tracked by Bloomberg that have
the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock. Seven recommend
selling the shares and 20 suggest holding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
