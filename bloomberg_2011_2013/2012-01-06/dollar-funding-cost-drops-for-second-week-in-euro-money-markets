The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars is headed for its second weekly decline, according to
a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, was at 102 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 10:51 a.m. in
 London , gaining 12 basis points this week. The swap rate added
13 basis points in the week ended Dec. 30, indicating lowered
cost of borrowing.  The one-year basis swap was 88 basis points less than
Euribor, from minus 98.5 at the start of the week, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits (ECBLDEPO)  at the  European
Central Bank  to an all-time high, placing 455 billion euros
($582 billion) with the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from
444 billion euros on Jan. 4.  A measure of banksâ€™ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  fell. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, dropped 4 basis
points this week to 93.  Three-month Euribor (EUR003M) , the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 1.288 percent from 1.356 percent
at the start of the week.  One-week Euribor (EUR001W)  dropped to 0.564
percent from 0.677 percent at the start of the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
