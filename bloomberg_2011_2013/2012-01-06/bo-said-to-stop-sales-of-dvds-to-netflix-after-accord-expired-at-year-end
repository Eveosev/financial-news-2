HBO,  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s premium cable
network, halted sales of DVDs to  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  following the Jan.
1 expiration of an agreement between the companies, according to
a person with knowledge of the situation.  HBO chose not to renew the deal as it pursues a separate
strategy of expanding HBO Go, an on-demand streaming service, in
conjunction with pay-TV operators, said the person, who wasn't 
authorized to speak publicly.   The cable channel had agreed to sell discs at a discount to
Los Gatos, California-based Netflix, operator of a DVD-by-mail
and online streaming service. Netflix often acquires DVD from
third-party distributors.  Steve Swasey, a Netflix spokesman, had no immediate
comment. Keith Cocozza, a spokesman for New York-based Time
Warner, declined to comment.  Netflix fell 1.4 percent to $79.30 at the close in  New
York . Time Warner gained 0.8 percent to $36.79.  HBO’s decision was reported earlier by the New York Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
