The yuan fell for a third day,
completing its first weekly drop in almost a month on signs
policy makers are limiting gains in the currency to protect
exports as  Europe ’s debt crisis deepens.  The People’s Bank of China set the fixing 0.08 percent
weaker at 6.3166 per dollar today after Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  said the government will roll out measures to boost
consumption this year. The economy expanded 8.6 percent from a
year earlier in the fourth quarter, the least since 2009,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before data due this month.  “They are buying time to slow yuan appreciation but not to
engineer yuan depreciation,” said  Nizam Idris , a currency
strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd. in Singapore. “We could see
a slower pace of yuan appreciation in the months ahead until a
soft landing in the Chinese economy is achieved.”  The yuan weakened 0.12 percent today and 0.25 percent this
week to 6.3095 per dollar in  Shanghai , according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The yuan strengthened 4.7 percent
last year, the best performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded
currencies excluding the yen.  “If China forces the yuan to depreciate in the face of
weaker growth, it will trigger massive capital outflows, which
will destabilize the economy further,” Idris said. He predicts
the currency will advance to 6 per dollar by year-end.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on Jan. 3 that business conditions
may be “relatively difficult” this quarter.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan strengthened 0.6
percent this week to 6.3095 per dollar. It was little changed
today. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.5 percent
this week to 6.3480, a 0.6 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate. The contracts fell 0.1 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
