German stocks (SXXP)  erased their gains,
trimming the  DAX (DAX)  Index’s third straight weekly advance, as BASF
SE and Bayer AG declined.  The DAX slipped 0.2 percent to 6,086.56 at 3:05 p.m. in
 Frankfurt , having earlier advanced as much as 0.9 percent after
a report showed U.S. payrolls topped forecasts. The wider HDAX
Index was little changed today.  The DAX has  increased (DAX)  20 percent from last year’s lowest
level on Sept. 12 as U.S. economic data showed the recovery is
gathering pace and optimism grew that euro-area policy makers
will contain the region’s debt crisis.  German factory orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and
inflation, sank 4.8 percent in November, the Economy Ministry in
Berlin said today. That’s the biggest drop since January 2009.
Economists forecast a decline of 1.8 percent, according to the
median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  The  U.S. economy  added 200,000 jobs last month, Labor
Department figures showed in  Washington . The median projection
in a Bloomberg News survey called for a December gain of
155,000. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent,
the lowest since February 2009, while hours worked and earnings
climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
