Hong Kong   stocks (HSI)  fell, paring this
week’s gain, as France’s borrowing costs rose at a bond auction,
adding to concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is deepening and
tempering gains by Chinese oil producers after a  tax cut .  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s largest lender by market value,
slid 2 percent. China Shanshui Cement Group led declines by
producers of the material after a report the country may impose
a carbon tax.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-owned developer,
sank 2.4 percent after a report that more cities may impose
property taxes. PetroChina Co., Asia’s No. 1 company by market
value, gained 2.3 percent after the government raised the
threshold for its so-called oil windfall tax.  The  Hang Seng  Index fell 1.2 percent to 18,593.06 at the
close, with more than four stocks declining for each that gained
in the 48-member gauge. The benchmark rose 0.9 percent for the
week, which was shortened by a holiday. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong slid
1.5 percent to 9,987.33.  “The news flow is pretty bearish right now,” said  Alex Au ,
Hong Kong-based managing director of Richland Capital Management
Ltd., which oversees $300 million. “No one really wants to
increase their risk appetite” with continuing uncertainty about
Europe and before Chinese New Year, he said. China’s markets
will be closed for the week of Jan. 23.  The Hang Seng Index tumbled 20 percent last year amid
concern Europe will fail to contain its debt crisis and China’s
monetary tightening will stall global economic growth. Companies
in the gauge traded at 9.5 times  forecast earnings (HSI)  at the close,
down from 14.4 times at the beginning of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index trades at
12.2 times.  French Debt  HSBC fell 2 percent to HK$59.50, while Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., which owns ports in  Germany , Italy and Spain, retreated
2.4 percent to HK$65.25.  In Europe,  France  sold 7.96 billion euros ($10.2 billion)
of debt, with 10-year borrowing costs rising in its first bond
auction of the year. Credit rating companies have threatened to
cut the nation’s AAA grade.  Carbon Tax  China Shanshui sank 7.8 percent to HK$4.63, while Anhui
Conch Cement Co., China’s biggest producer of the material,
declined 5 percent to HK$21.05. China National Building Material
Co., a mainland maker of cement and dry wall, dropped 5.8
percent to HK$7.79.  China is considering imposing a stand-alone carbon tax,
separate from the environmental carbon dioxide tax, Economic
Information Daily reported, citing Su Ming, deputy head of the
Ministry of Finance’s research institute for fiscal science.  “There’s some news coming from  China  that they’re going to
charge carbon emission tax, so some sectors are affected, like
cement, that emit a lot of carbon,” said Richland’s Au. “Today
the only bright spot is the oil sector in China because of the
windfall tax reform.”  Fitch Ratings  said it expects lower average selling prices
for cement in China as supply continues to outstrip demand.  China Resources Land retreated 2.4 percent to HK$12.08 and
Guangzhou R&F Properties Co., a developer in the Southern
Chinese city, slid 2.3 percent to HK$5.89 after Shanghai
Securities News reported Guangzhou and Nanjing may follow
Shanghai and Chongqing in imposing property taxes, citing Jia
Kang, head of the  Finance Ministry ’s research institute for
fiscal science.  Oil Tax  Among stocks that rose, PetroChina gained 2.3 percent to
HK$10.62. Cnooc Ltd., China’s No. 1 offshore oil producer,
advanced 3 percent to HK$15.08, while China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp., known as Sinopec, increased 1.9 percent to HK$8.81. The
three stocks  gained the most (HSI)  in the Hang Seng.  China raised the threshold on a windfall tax paid by crude
producers in a move that analysts say may spur exploration of
the nation’s energy resources. The level at which the tax would
be applied was raised to $55 a barrel from $40 effective Nov. 1,
2011, the  oil companies  said yesterday.  China Assurance Finance Group Ltd., a credit guarantor,
surged 59 percent to 44.5 Hong Kong cents on its debut.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 0.8 percent to
18,650. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  rose 4.9 percent to 24.66 today,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 7.1 percent in the
benchmark over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
