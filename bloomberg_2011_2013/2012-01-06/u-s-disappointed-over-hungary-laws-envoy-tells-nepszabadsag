Hungary ignored U.S. concerns when it
passed fundamental laws at the end of last year, causing “big
disappointment,” U.S. Ambassador Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis
said in an interview with  Nepszabadsag .  “It has only become clear to us in recent weeks that in
many areas where we had serious concerns, our remarks were
completely ignored,” Kounalakis said in the interview,
published today.  The U.S. will continue to stress issues it considers
“problematic,” including laws on the judiciary, the central
bank, the media and religious freedom, the ambassador told the
Budapest-based newspaper.  No reply by the Hungarian government to a letter by
Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  on U.S. concerns has been
received yet, Kounalakis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
