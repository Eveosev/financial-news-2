China’s stocks (IFB1)  headed for their
longest weekly losing streak since 2004 on concern small
companies are struggling to borrow money because of a cash
crunch and that an export slowdown will drag down the economy.  SAIC Motor Co. (600104)  fell 2 percent, leading declines for
consumer companies that are reliant on growth in  China’s
economy .  Ufida Software Co. (600588)  slid 3.5 percent, adding to a 12
percent plunge this week.  Tianjin Tasly Pharmaceutical Co. (600535) 
dropped to the lowest level since April, pacing declines for
drugmakers. PetroChina Co., the nation’s biggest energy producer
and most valuable company, gained 1.3 percent after the
government raised the threshold of a windfall tax on crude.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slid 0.4 percent to 2,140.73 as of
1:08 p.m. local time. The measure has lost 2.7 percent this
holiday- shortened week, poised for the longest weekly losing
streak since the week ended June 25, 2004. The CSI 300 Index
slumped 0.6 percent to 2,262.57 today.  “Liquidity is still weak and there are no signs of the
reserve ratio being cut,” said Cao Xuefeng, an analyst at Huaxi
Securities Co. in Chengdu.  Small-company stocks have plunged this week because of
investor disappointment that lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios
haven’t been cut amid signs of a cash crunch as households
prepare for Lunar New Year celebrations that start on Jan. 23.
The Shenzhen Composite Index lost 1.7 percent today, adding to a
7.7 percent slump since the start of the new year. The ChiNext
index of start-up companies fell 2.6 percent today, and is down
11 percent this week.  Cash Crunch  The People’s Bank of  China  is injecting the most funds in
eight weeks into the financial system. The central bank added a
net 51 billion yuan ($8.1 billion) to the banking system this
week as bill redemptions exceeded issuance, and canceled a
second straight auction of three-month notes yesterday.  China’s seven-day repo rate fell 20 basis points to 4.31
percent today in  Shanghai , based on a daily fixing by the
National Interbank Funding Center. That compares with an average
3.82 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011. Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc, Societe Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA said
they believe policy makers are targeting a rate of no more than
3 percent.  Economists at  Barclays Capital  and Bank of America Corp.
say the central bank will cut lenders’ reserve requirements
before the Chinese New Year holiday, the second reduction since
2008. The People’s Bank of China raised reserve ratios six times
last year to cool inflation that accelerated to its fastest pace
in three years in July.  Record Low Valuations  The Shanghai Composite trades at 8.7 times estimated
earnings, a record low according to Bloomberg data dating back
to 2006, after plunging 22 percent last year on concern
increases in borrowing costs and  Europe ’s debt crisis will
derail economic growth. The CSI 300 slid 25 percent in 2011.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said more cuts in banks reserve-
ratio requirements and loosening of loan quotas are needed to
ease liquidity and that there will be no imminent recovery for
A-shares until liquidity is “sufficiently supportive.”  China’s economic growth will continue to weaken with
relatively tight liquidity in the real economy and earnings
growth forecasts facing downward pressure, Goldman Sachs said in
a report dated Jan. 3. The earnings downgrade risk for  small (SH000905)  and
mid-caps is “still high” given tight liquidity, it said.  Technology Stocks  Ufida Software dropped 3.5 percent to 15.90 yuan.  Sanan
Optoelectronics Co. (600703) , China’s biggest listed manufacturer of
light-emitting diode chips, fell 2.3 percent to 10.28 yuan. CPT
Technology Group Co. plunged 9.9 percent to 12.03 yuan in
Shenzhen.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission should raise the
acceptable non-performing loan ratio in lending for small
technology companies, the China Securities Journal reported,
citing Wang Huaqing, the regulator’s disciplinary commissioner.  A gauge of drugmakers in the CSI 300 slid 1.7 percent
today, adding to a 8.1 percent loss for the week, the most among
10 industry groups. Tasly, which produces Chinese medicine, fell
3.2 percent to 37.37 yuan.  Growth in goverment health-care spending this year will
exceed overall government budget increases, supported by a need
to build a social safety net and reduce social inequality,
Katherine Lu, analyst at Cowen and Co., said in a report dated
yesterday. Product pricing control, a “sluggish” export
environment and “uncertainties” over economic growth are
“near-term overhangs” for Chinese drugmakers, she said.  Consumption Policies  A measure of consumer discretionary stocks slumped 1.5
percent today. SAIC, China’s biggest automaker, fell 2 percent
to 14.10 yuan. Beijing Wangfujing Department Store (Group) Co.
led declines for retailers, sliding 3.3 percent to 29.72 yuan.  The Chinese economy expanded 8.6 percent from a year
earlier in the fourth quarter, the least since June 2009,
according to the median estimate of 21 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Export growth slowed to a two-year low of 13.5
percent in December.  China will roll out measures to boost consumption this year
as it strives to meet challenges posed by a global slowdown,
Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  said.  The government is studying policies to encourage spending
on energy-saving products, and will take other measures
including the promotion of online shopping and tourism, Chen
told the ministry’s annual works conference, according to a
statement posted on its website yesterday.  PetroChina gained 1.3 percent to 9.93 yuan after China’s
finance ministry increased the threshold of the tax to $55 per
barrel from $40, effective Nov. 1, 2011.  Citigroup Inc. estimated a 16 percent “positive impact”
on PetroChina full-year earnings from the cut in the windfall
profit tax. PetroChina becomes the top pick among three large-
cap China oil stocks instead of  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) 
because of PetroChina’s “higher sensitivity” to the  tax cut 
and Sinopec’s recent outperformance, Citigroup analyst Graham Cunningham said in a report dated yesterday.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
