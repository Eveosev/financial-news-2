What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on expectations that
excessive heat and little rain over the next three days will
cause irreversible damage to some crops in  Argentina  and
southern  Brazil , before rains develop Jan. 9,  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT on speculation that weather damage to crops in  South
America  will boost overseas demand for U.S. supplies, Roose
said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.25 cent to 0.35
cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3
higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that demand for the grain will
rise from makers of livestock feed as corn prices climb, Roose
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
