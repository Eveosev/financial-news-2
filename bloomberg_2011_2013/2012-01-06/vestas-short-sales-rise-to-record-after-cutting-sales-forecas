Short sales of Vestas Wind Systems
A/S rose to a record after the world’s biggest wind turbine
maker cut its revenue forecast for the second time in three
months.  Short positions (VWS)  in Vestas rose to 17.8 percent as of Jan.
4, the most in more than five years, according to figures on
Bloomberg compiled by Data Explorers Inc. Short sellers borrow
stocks and sell them in the anticipation of profiting by
repurchasing the securities later at a lower price.  The company, based in Aarhus,  Denmark , on Jan. 3 pared its
revenue forecast for 2011 by 400 million euros to 6 billion
euros, after slashing 600 million euros from an earlier forecast
of 7 billion euros on Oct. 30. Orders for 2011 will total 7.4
gigawatts, meeting the turbine maker’s forecasts.  The short-selling data series goes back to July 2006. The
Jan. 4 record follows the previous high of 17.3 percent on Dec.
27. Vestas today rose 3.9 percent to 57.15 kroner ($9.84) as of
10:30 a.m. in Copenhagen after losing more than a fifth of its
value in two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
