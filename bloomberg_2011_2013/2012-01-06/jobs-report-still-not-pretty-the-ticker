The  U.S. economy  beat expectations last month, adding 200,000 jobs in December. That means the  jobs picture  is slightly less grim this month. Slightly. Here's the Hamilton Project's  assessment  of prospects for the unemployed: The jobs gap is still 12.1 million jobs. At a rate of 208,000 new jobs per month, it will take slightly more than 12 years to close that gap, according to the Hamilton Project, a public policy group started in 2006 by the  Brookings Institution . For the unemployed, the U.S. labor market remains the worst since the Great Depression. (Francis Wilkinson is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.)
