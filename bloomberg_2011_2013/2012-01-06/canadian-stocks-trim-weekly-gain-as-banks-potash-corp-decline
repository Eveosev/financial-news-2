upside” in the U.S., Philip Petursson, managing director of the

to jump up and down and be overly enthusiastic about this jobs
number. Global growth is moderating.”  The index climbed this week as raw-materials and energy
stocks gained on economic data indicating strengthening global
manufacturing and ADP Employer Services’ U.S. payrolls estimate.
