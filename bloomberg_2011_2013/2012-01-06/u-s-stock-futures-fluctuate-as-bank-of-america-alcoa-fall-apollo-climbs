U.S. stocks fell as better-than-
forecast jobs growth and a drop in the unemployment rate failed
to extend a weekly rally and lift the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index above its October high.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Morgan Stanley fell more than
1.2 percent after analysts lowered the banks’ fourth-quarter
earnings estimates.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  lost 2.1 percent after
surging 8.6 percent yesterday. Alcoa Inc., due to start the
earnings season on Jan. 9, slid 2.1 percent after saying it will
close 12 percent of its global smelting capacity.  The  S&P 500 (SPH2)  fell 0.3 percent to 1,277.81 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The index snapped a three-day advance, trimming its gain
for the week to 1.6 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
dropped 55.78 points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,359.92 today.  “It’s definitely a solid report, but not a blowout
surprise,”  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth
Capital Management in Richmond,  Virginia , which oversees about
$44 billion, said in a phone interview. “The drop in the
 unemployment rate  is good news, but it may reflect sluggishness
in the labor force growth and it suggests that from a policy
perspective we still have a lot of work to do.”  The  S&P 500  has jumped 16 percent from its 2011 low as
better-than-expected economic data boosted optimism that the
world’s largest economy can weather  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis. The rally has brought the index toward the top of a
 trading range (SPX)  it has be stuck in since August.  More Workers  U.S. employers added 200,000 workers to payrolls in
December, Labor Department figures showed in  Washington , more
than the 155,000 gain projected in a Bloomberg News survey. The
unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent, the lowest
since February 2009. The growth in payrolls did not beat
estimates by as wide a margin as data from ADP Employer Services
yesterday that helped trigger gains in equities.  Equities also dropped earlier as German factory orders fell
4.8 percent, the biggest decline in almost three years, fueling
concern that Europe was heading into a recession.  Most U.S. stocks rose yesterday as banks rallied and a
private report showed payrolls climbed, offsetting reduced
profit forecasts at companies including Target Corp. and J.C.
Penney Co.  Alcoa (AA)  fell 2.1 percent, the most in the Dow, to $9.16. The
biggest U.S. aluminum producer said yesterday it would close 12
percent of its smelting capacity amid falling prices. Alcoa is
scheduled to mark the unofficial start of the fourth-quarter
earnings season next week. Profit at S&P 500 companies rose 6
percent during the September-December  period (SPX) , according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, which would mark the
slowest growth since the third quarter of 2009.  Banks Tumble  Financial shares (S5FINL)  dropped 0.6 percent as a group in the S&P
500. Bank of America lost 2.1 percent, the second-most in the
Dow, to $6.18. It surged 8.6 percent yesterday amid speculation
the U.S. may introduce a new mortgage refinancing program. The
shares retreated today after an Obama administration official,
who asked for anonymity, denied that the White House is
considering a trillion-dollar plan to refinance home loans.  Goldman Sachs slipped 1.2 percent to $93.42, while  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  lost 2.3 percent to $15.90. The major U.S. banks most
reliant on trading had their earnings estimates reduced by
analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. and Ticonderoga
Securities LLC as a weak fourth quarter dimmed prospects for a
capital-markets rebound in the first half of 2012. Meredith
Whitney Advisory Group LLC also cut fourth-quarter estimates on
the banks.  Family Dollar Falls  Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO)  fell 7.5 percent to $53.63 for
the biggest retreat in the S&P 500. The discount retailer
reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $2.15 billion, missing
the average analyst estimate of $2.17 billion. Comparable store
sales increased 4.1 percent, compared with the average analyst
estimate of 4.9 percent.  Stocks of companies that rely on consumer discretionary
spending had the biggest gain among S&P 500 industries, rising
0.2 percent as a group.  J.C. Penney (JCP)  advanced 3.5 percent to $34.96 after being
raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at Macquarie Group
Ltd. The third-largest department-store chain lost 2.7 percent
yesterday after cutting its fourth-quarter profit forecast,
citing declining sales and deeper discounts than anticipated
during the holiday season.  Best Buy Co. gained 3.3 percent to $24.22. The world’s
largest consumer-electronics retailer posted a same-store sales
drop in December that was in line with analysts’ estimates and
repeated its forecast for profit this year.  Highest Closing  With the S&P 500 this week approaching its highest closing
since Oct. 28 and Aug. 1, chart levels fixated investors today.  The S&P 500 ended yesterday at 1,281.06, within 0.4 percent
of its highest level since Aug. 1. Its relative strength index,
a measure of how fast prices have risen in the last two weeks,
was 61.2. Readings above 70 are considered by some traders as
evidence a rally has been too rapid.  “The feeling in the market is that we need more catalysts
to break above the resistance levels we are bumping up against
right now,” Dan McMahon, director of equity trading at Raymond
James Financial Inc. in  New York , said in a telephone interview.
“We’re in the high end of the trading range that we’ve been
stuck in since August.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
