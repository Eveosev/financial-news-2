Serbian oil company  Naftna Industrija
Srbije AD (NIIS) ’s net income probably rose to more than 300 million
euros ($383.3 million) last year,  Politika  newspaper reported,
citing an adviser to the prime minister.  Serbia’s biggest oil company, which is controlled by  OAO
Gazprom Neft (GAZP)  and 29.87 percent owned by the government, may
continue reinvesting its entire profit rather than pay dividends
to increase value, which could push the  share price (NIIS)  to 1,000
dinars, the report said quoting Petar Skundric, who is also a
former energy minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
