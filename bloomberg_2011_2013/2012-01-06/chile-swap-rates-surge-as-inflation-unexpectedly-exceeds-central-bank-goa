Chilean interest-rate  swap yields (YCSW0193) 
rose the most in 10 weeks after a report showed prices increased
at the fastest pace in almost three years, exceeding estimates
and the central bank’s inflation target.  The one-year swap rate soared 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 4.65 percent. Three-month breakeven
inflation almost doubled to 2.95 percent from 1.48 percent
yesterday, while inflation-linked swap rates plunged.  Chilean  consumer prices (CNPINSMO)  jumped 0.6 percent last month,
triple the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
and double the pace predicted in the inflation forwards market.
Annual inflation was 4.4 percent, the highest since April 2009.
The readings mean the central bank won’t reduce borrowing costs
at its next meeting, as had been forecast by 50 of the 58
investors in a central bank survey Dec. 20, said Juan Pablo Castro, an economist at Banco Santander  Chile .  “There is an almost zero probability that the central bank
will cut rates in January,” Castro said from Santiago. “The
central bank forecast was off by 50 basis points in just one
month. That’s a warning signal that the bank will be more
cautious in observing whether this inflation phenomena reverses
or not.”  The six-month inflation-linked swap rate fell 60 basis
points to a six-month low of 1.8 percent. The three-month
inflation-linked rate plunged 140 basis points to 2.05 percent.  The two-year peso swap rate climbed 10 basis points to 4.53
percent and the three-month rate rose eight basis points to a
seven-week high of 5.06 percent.  The bank, which targets inflation of 2 percent to 4 percent
over two years, has kept its key  interest rate  at 5.25 percent
for six months after raising it five times in 2011.  Inflation Outlook  Policy makers said less than three weeks ago that they
expected inflation to end this year at 3.9 percent. The median
estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for consumer
prices to climb 4 percent in the year.  Chile’s peso slid 0.2 percent to 510.93 per U.S. dollar,
reversing an earlier gain, after the euro slid to a 15-month low
against the dollar as confidence in the region’s economy fell.
The Chilean currency gained 1.7 percent this week.  The bank forecast 2012 inflation of 2.7 percent and growth
slowing to between 3.75 percent and 4.75 percent from 6.2
percent this year. That scenario still seems reasonable, said
Dalibor Eterovic, chief economist at Banco Security in Santiago.  “It’s hard to think that Chile is going to decouple from
the rest of the world and maintain its dynamism and inflation,”
he said. “We still think a 25 basis point cut is more likely,
but the risks to that forecast have risen. The higher inflation
could lead the committee to consider that, while the conditions
are there, they can afford to wait another month.”  Brazilian consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in December,
slower than the 0.55 percent median forecast of 47 analysts.  Implied Inflation  Six-month break-even inflation, which measures the likely
future average rate of price rises discounted by the swaps
market, rose 68 basis points to 3 percent, the highest since
July, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. One-year break-
even climbed 32 basis points to 3.10 percent, breaching 3
percent for the first time in almost two months.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
lowered their short position in the currency against the  U.S.
dollar  to $5.7 billion on Jan. 3 from $6.1 billion on Dec. 30.
That is a $407 million bet on the Chilean peso in the first two
days of the year.  Core consumer prices, which exclude fuel and produce,
increased 0.7 percent in December from November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
