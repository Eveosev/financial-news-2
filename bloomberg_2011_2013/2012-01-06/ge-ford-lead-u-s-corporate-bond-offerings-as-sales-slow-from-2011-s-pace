General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  lead $27.6 billion of corporate bond sales in the U.S. this
week as the pace of offerings slows from a year ago with
European issuers on the sidelines.  GE Capital Corp., the finance arm of the world’s largest
maker of  jet engines , sold $4 billion of notes and Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford Motor Credit Co. added $1 billion to a pair
of offerings from last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales this week are 43 percent below the $48.7
billion issued during the similar period a year ago.  Issuance of investment-grade company securities may fall to
$60 billion to $70 billion this month, or as little as 44
percent of the five-year January average, as  Europe ’s fiscal
crisis reduces investor appetite for debt from the region’s
lenders, according to Bank of America Corp. BNP Paribas SA and
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG were among European banks
selling $16.4 billion of debt in the first week of 2011,
Bloomberg data show.  “The biggest difference is the significant escalation of
the European crisis, complemented by a decline in expectations
for growth,”  Adrian Miller , fixed-income strategist at Miller
Tabak Roberts Securities LLC, said in a telephone interview.
“The European banks’ issues and the lack of issuance from them
dovetail into those two issues.”  GE Capital, based in Stamford,  Connecticut , issued $2
billion of three-year notes and $1 billion each of five- and 10-
year debt, Bloomberg data show. Bank of  Nova Scotia  sold $2.75
billion of debt and Citigroup Inc. raised $2.5 billion as
investment-grade issuers tapped the market for $24.1 billion.  Ford, Amerigas  Ford Motor Credit sold $300 million of notes maturing in
January 2015 and $700 million of debentures due in May 2018
after issuing $1.25 billion of each maturity in separate sales
last year, Bloomberg data show. AmeriGas Partners LP, the
largest retail propane distributor, sold $1.55 billion of eight-
and 10-year notes.  Bank of Montreal sold $1.5 billion of five-year, 2.5
percent notes and Icahn Enterprises LP issued $500 million of 8
percent, six-year debt as offerings today reached $3.15 billion,
Bloomberg data show.  The extra yield investors demand to own U.S. corporate
bonds instead of Treasuries has climbed 98 basis points, or 0.98
percentage point, to 341 basis points from a year ago, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads on bonds
issued in the U.S. by euro-area lenders have expanded 229 basis
points over that span, compared with 171 basis points of
widening for all bank bonds, the data show.  Corporate Bond Yields  Absolute yields on U.S. corporate bonds fell to 4.81
percent, compared with 5.02 percent on Jan. 5, 2011, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show.  Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, the German state-
controlled  development bank  with AAA ratings from Moody’s
Investors Service and  Standard & Poor’s , was the only European
lender to issue debt in the U.S. this week, Bloomberg data show.
The bank sold $4.5 billion of 1 percent, three-year notes.  “We expect decent non-European, non-U.S. financial volumes
-- in sharp contrast to the last two years that have seen very
heavy volumes of financial supply to start the year,” Hans Mikkelsen, Bank of America’s investment-grade credit strategist,
wrote in a Dec. 21 note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
