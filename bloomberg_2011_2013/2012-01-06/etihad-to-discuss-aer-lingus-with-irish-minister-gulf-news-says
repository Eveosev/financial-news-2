Etihad Airways  Chief Executive
Officer James Hogan will discuss the Irish government’s stake in
 Aer Lingus (AERL)  Group Plc when he meets the nation’s transport
minister tomorrow, the Gulf News newspaper reported without
saying where it got the information.  The Irish government has said it may sell its 25 percent
stake in the Dublin-based carrier to reduce debt. The meeting
follows initial discussions in September, Gulf News reported.  Etihad Airways, based in Abu Dhabi, said Dec. 19 it would
increase a stake in Air Berlin Plc to 29 percent and provide
financing for the purchase of new aircraft. As part of the deal
the German carrier will share flight codes with Etihad and
shift flights from Dubai to  Abu Dhabi .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
