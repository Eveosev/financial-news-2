Polkomtel SA, the second-largest
mobile phone company in  Poland , plans to sell the equivalent of
900 million euros ($1.1 billion) of bonds in what would be
 Europe ’s first high-yield corporate issue in two months.  The company will issue eight-year bonds in euros, dollars
and zloty that are callable after four years, a banker with
knowledge of the deal said. The sale would be the first euro-
denominated junk offering from a non-financial company since
HeidelbergCement AG added 200 million euros to its 9.5 percent
bonds due 2018 on Nov. 9, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The money raised will repay a bridge loan used in the
acquisition of Polkomtel, which billionaire Zygmunt Solorz-Zak
agreed to take over in June. Deutsche Bank AG,  Credit Agricole
SA (ACA) , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Societe Generale SA
will manage the fundraising, with investor meetings starting in
the U.S. on Jan. 9, said the banker, who declined to be
identified before the terms are set.  The bonds, which are yet to be rated, will be issued by
Eileme 2 AB. Junk, or speculative-grade, bonds are rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
