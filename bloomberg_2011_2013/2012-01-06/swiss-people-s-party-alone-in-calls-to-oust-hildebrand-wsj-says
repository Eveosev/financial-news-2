The right-wing  Swiss People’s Party 
is isolated in its calls for the resignation of Swiss central
bank chief Philipp Hildebrand over currency-trading allegations,
the Wall Street Journal reported.  Influential political parties including the Social
Democrats and the Green Liberal Party have pledged to support
Swiss National Bank President Hildebrand, the  newspaper  said on
its website, citing lawmakers.  The Liberals said politics shouldn’t interfere with the  SNB (SNBN) 
and the BDP Party said it’ll wait for the outcome of a meeting
scheduled for next week, adding that it expects no new facts to
emerge, according to the report.  Hildebrand yesterday said he’ll stay at the helm of the SNB
and expressed regret that he didn’t curb his wife’s currency
trading after details of his bank account leaked, leading to
calls for his resignation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
