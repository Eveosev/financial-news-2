Chicago  gasoline strengthened for the
first time in four days after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut a coker
compressor at the  Joliet (XOJOCRUD)  oil refinery in  Illinois .  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Chicago (CHCG87PC)  jumped 6.5
cents to trade at a 2.5-cent premium to gasoline futures on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange, the first premium in almost two
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 4:25 p.m. in
New York. Prompt-delivery of the fuel in Chicago rose 8.01 cents
to $2.7766 a gallon.  “There’s a lot of independents out in this area, and the
minute they hear something go down, they’re buying,”  Phil Flynn , an analyst with PFGBest in Chicago, said during a
telephone interview. “It’s definitely a buy-first-and-ask-
questions-later area.”  Irving, Texas-based Exxon shut a compressor at the 238,000-
barrel-a-day Joliet refinery coker’s main fractionator two days
ago, according to a filing with the National Response Center.
The compressor was returned to service and production at the
plant wasn’t affected, Tricia Simpson, a spokeswoman for the
refinery, said in an e-mail today.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  Chicago (CHCGUTLS)  was unchanged at a
discount of 13.5 cents to heating oil futures.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  widened 0.25 cent to 5 cents versus futures. The same
fuel in  New York (MOSNY87P)  fell 0.12 cent to a discount of 1.13 cents.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the  Midwest (GRP3G387)  gained 1.25
cents to a 19.25-cent discount.  California-blend gasoline, known as Carbob, in  Los Angeles (MOGLDB85) 
strengthened for the first time in four days, by 0.12 cent to a
premium of 12.25 cents against futures. The same fuel in  San
Francisco (MOGSD85P)  also climbed 0.12 cent to 8.25 cents above futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
