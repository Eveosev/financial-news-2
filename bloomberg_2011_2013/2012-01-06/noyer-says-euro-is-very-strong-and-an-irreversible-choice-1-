The euro remains “very strong” and
a further decline would help exports, Bank of France Governor
 Christian Noyer  said.  “The euro remains a highly rated currency,” he said in an
interview today with Europe 1 radio in Paris. “It is a bit less
strong, but that’s not a bad thing; it helps exports.”  The euro was worth $1.17 when it was created in 1999, Noyer
said. The currency today fell to a 15-month low versus the
dollar on speculation declining  consumer confidence 
and spending will make it harder for European leaders to contain
the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. The euro fell to $1.2764
before trading at $1.2774 at 9:01 a.m. in Paris.  “That’s the paradox,” Noyer said. “Everyone talks about
crisis, but it remains very strong.”  The euro is an “irreversible choice,” he said. “Everyone
must stop fantasies about the end of the euro. The crisis in the
euro zone isn’t about the single currency itself, but about
problems with management of the debt.”  Noyer also said the  European Central Bank  can continue to
refinance banks “without risk” and that the ECB expects the
inflation rate will decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
