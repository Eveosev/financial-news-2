Hog futures climbed for the first
time in three days on speculation beef processors will increase
purchases. Cattle also advanced.  The price of  hogs (HOGSNATL)  for immediate delivery rose 0.8 percent
to 80.97 cents a pound, a three-week high, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Hog futures slumped 2 percent in the
previous two sessions, the biggest two-day loss in a week. The
sell-off may be “overdone,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst
for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis .  “They’re certainly set up here for some kind of a pop,”
Dick Quiter, a broker at McFarland Commodities LLC in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “Just the thought that the cash
was steady to a little firmer kind of inspired the hogs here.”  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.7 percent to
84.425 cents a pound at 11:10 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price is up 5.8 percent in the past 12 months.  Cattle futures for February delivery advanced 0.3 percent
to $1.21275 a pound on the CME. Prices have gained 14 percent in
the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement rose 0.1 percent
to $1.51 a pound in  Chicago . Yesterday, prices reached a record
$1.521.  To contact the reporter on this story:
