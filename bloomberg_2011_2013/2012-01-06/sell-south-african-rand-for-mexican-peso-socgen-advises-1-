Investors should sell the rand for
 Mexico ’s peso as  Europe ’s debt crisis will hurt South Africa’s
currency while the  U.S. economy  recovery will help the Latin
country, Societe Generale SA said.  SocGen is advising clients to sell rand at 1.6840 pesos,
with a target of 1.6300 and a stop-loss at 1.7160, Guillaume Salomon, a London-based analyst at the French bank, said in an
e-mailed note.  “We believe that the outlook in  Latin America ,
particularly in Mexico, is much more favourable than in the euro
zone,” Salomon wrote. “In addition, the magnitude of contagion
risks is likely to be much less significant in the period ahead
for Latin America,”  European confidence in the economic outlook fell to the
lowest in more than two years and German factory orders plunged
as the euro area’s leaders struggled to contain a worsening
fiscal crisis and global demand weakened, reports today showed.
The European Union is  South Africa ’s biggest regional trading
partner, accounting for 30 percent of the nation’s trade.  “The market is making an increasing differentiation
between emerging markets at the center of the on-going crisis in
the euro-zone and other EM regions, in particular Latin
America,” Salomon wrote. “The Mexican peso is fundamentally
cheap in our view, and is well positioned to take advantage of
the positive short-term dynamics in the U.S. economy.”  U.S. employers added 200,000 jobs in December, double the
revised 100,000 in November and more than the 155,000 median
estimate of economist in a Bloomberg survey. The unemployment
rate unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent, the lowest since February
2009, labor department data showed.  The rand retreated 0.1 percent to 1.6829 pesos as of 3:38
p.m. in Johannesburg, paring its decline against the Mexican
currency this year to 2.4 percent. The South African currency
retreated 7.5 percent against the peso in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
