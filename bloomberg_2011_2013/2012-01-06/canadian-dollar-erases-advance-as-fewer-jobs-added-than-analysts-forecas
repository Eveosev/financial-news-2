Canada ’s dollar weakened for a third
day against its U.S. counterpart after a report showed the
nation’s employers added fewer jobs in December than forecast
and the jobless rate rose to the highest level since April.  The currency briefly pared losses after a report showed the
U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped, bolstering optimism
about the economy of Canada’s largest trading partner. The
loonie, as the currency is sometimes known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, headed for a loss this week of 0.5
percent, its second straight.  “Disappointing report overall,”  Camilla Sutton , head of
currency strategy at Bank of  Nova Scotia , said of Canada’s jobs
data by phone from Toronto. “Soft details combined with a miss
on the expectation suggest that there are increasing internal
headwinds for the Canadian economy.”  The currency depreciated 0.8 percent to C$1.0284 per  U.S.
dollar  at 5 p.m. Toronto time after earlier rising 0.3 percent.
One Canadian dollar buys 97.24 U.S. cents.  Crude, the nation’s biggest export, added 0.6 percent to
$101.92 a barrel in  New York  after dropping to $100.88. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent.  Canada’s jobless  rate (CANLNETJ)  increased to 7.5 percent from
November’s 7.4 percent and the recent low of 7.1 percent in
September,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Employment
rose by 17,500 in the first gain in three months. The median
forecast of economists in Bloomberg News surveys of analysts and
economists was for a 7.4 percent jobless rate and a gain of
20,000 jobs.  U.S. Employment  The U.S. added 200,000 jobs last month following a revised
100,000 gain in November that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey called for a December gain of
155,000. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent,
the lowest since February 2009, while hours worked and earnings
climbed.  The labor market “continues to contribute to some of the
optimism that’s been in the U.S. data,”  Jack Spitz , managing
director of foreign exchange at  National Bank of Canada  in
Toronto, said in a telephone interview. “It serves to show the
divergence of economics and fundamentals between this side of
the Atlantic and the other side of the Atlantic.” He predicted
both the greenback and the loonie would outperform major
counterparts into the new year.  The euro dropped against most of its major peers, including
the dollars of Canada and the U.S., on speculation the
sovereign-debt crisis is worsening.  Yearly Growth  Canada’s economy will grow at 2 percent pace this year, the
U.S. will expand 2.1 percent, while the euro-area economy will
contract 0.2 percent, according to the median forecasts in
separate Bloomberg News surveys.  The currency fell on Oct. 4 to C$1.0658, the weakest level
in more than a year, as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis sapped
demand for higher-yielding assets.  Shorter-term  government bonds  rose, pushing yields on
benchmark two-year debt three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, lower to 0.93 percent. The extra yield over U.S.
Treasuries narrowed to 68 basis points, the smallest spread in a
week. Canada will sell C$3.5 billion ($3.4 billion) of bonds
maturing in May 2014 on Jan. 11.  The loonie will depreciate to C$1.05 by the end of the
first quarter, according to the median forecast of 35 economists
and analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
