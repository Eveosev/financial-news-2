Daniel Kitson is a unique English
funnyman with brilliantly original material. Catch his latest
show, “It’s Always Right Now, Until It’s Later,” at St. Ann’s
Warehouse.  A big hit at the Edinburgh Fringe, his monologue tells the
story of a man and a woman whose paths cross for a second. It’s
also about how we’re all trapped in the minuscule present
moment.  Runs through Jan. 29 at 38 Water Street, Dumbo,  Brooklyn .
Information: +1-718-254-8779;  http://stannswarehouse.org .  Or take a chance on the  Public Theater ’s always adventurous
Under the Radar festival.  Shows as disparate as “Sontag: Reborn,” drawn from the
journals of the late aesthete, and the appallingly titled “Lick
But Don’t Swallow!” about an angel who must earn her wings
while making a pornographic movie, are presented by troupes from
around the world.  Runs at various venues through Jan. 15. Information: +1-
212-539-8500;  http://www.undertheradarfestival.com .  Saturday  Ai Weiwei’s “Sunflower Seeds” opens today at the Mary
Boone Gallery.  The installation caused some trouble in 2010 at  London ’s
 Tate Modern  when viewers clambering on the seeds were found to
be kicking up and inhaling toxic dust. The exhibit was then
roped off.  This time, there will be no walking on the 5 tons of hand-
painted porcelain seeds which were produced by 1,600 artisans in
Jiangxi,  China .  For the activist artist, the large number of unique seeds
is a commentary on the contradictions inherent in Chinese
society.  Runs through Feb. 4 at 541 W. 24th St. Information: +1-212-
752-2929;  http://www.maryboonegallery.com .  Head over to Bottino for a plate of Orecchiette with
broccoli rabe and boar sausage, accompanied by a glass of
Montepulciano d’Abruzzo. Try the tasty bread pudding for
dessert.  At 246 Tenth Ave. Information: +1-212-206-6766.  Saturday Midtown  In a tranquil backyard scene, clover dapples a green lawn,
tools are stacked against a weather-beaten shed and delicate
leaves fill the sky. The one startling note is a suspended,
upside down figure.  It’s Jeff Wall’s “Boy Falls From Tree” (2010), one of his
recent photographs on exhibit at Marian Goodman Gallery.  Runs through Jan. 21 at 24 W. 57th St. Information: +1-212-
977-7160;  http://www.mariangoodman.com .  Saturday Night  “The Enchanted Island” is the new hit show at the
 Metropolitan Opera , a totally entertaining Baroque pastiche
created by Jeremy Sams and directed by Phelim McDermott.  A mash-up of Shakespeare’s “The Tempest” and “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream” outfitted with arias by 18th century
composers, the show features Joyce DiDonato as an angry witch,
Luca Pisaroni as her sweetly dopy loser son Caliban, and a funny
star turn by Placido Domingo as Neptune.  If you can’t make it to the Met, don’t miss the Jan. 21 HD
transmission to theaters at 1 p.m. New York time.  Runs through Jan. 30 at  Lincoln Center . Information: +1-
212-362-6000;  http://www.metoperafamily.org .  Another option: The  New York Philharmonic  presents the
local premiere of “Polaris” by the always interesting British
composer Thomas Ades.  He shares the program with the rather longer, darker
Mahler’s Ninth, the ailing Austrian’s last symphony and one
infused with a sense of yearning, impending death and hopeful
transcendence.  Music director  Alan Gilbert  is on the podium.  Avery Fisher Hall , Lincoln Center. Information: +1-212-875-
5656;  http://nyphil.org .  Sunday Morning  How about a musical exploring the soul of capitalism?  Produced by avant-garde troupe TEAM, “Mission Drift”
takes on economics with lizard ballet, atomic blasts, Vegas-
charged ballads and Southern-inflected blues.  A symbol of boom and bust, Miss Atomic reigns over the
action, spanning 400 years of American history.  The show is part of the COIL 2012 winter festival, produced
by P.S. 122, bringing together U.S. and international artists.  “Mission Drift” runs through Feb. 4 at the Connelly
Theater, 220 E. 4th St. Information: +1-212-352-3101;
 http://www.ps122.org .  Sunday  Want to take a look at some big boy toys? Then head over to
the boat show at the Javits Center.  From the $1.4 million 540 Sundancer to a personal kayak,
you can check out the latest vessels and gear, including GPS
devices and bespoke weather accessories.  You can also learn to reel them in at the Fishing
University or just brag about the one that got away.  Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, 655 W. 34th St.
Information: +1-212-216-2000;  http://www.nyboatshow.com .  Sunday Evening  Party-rock whiz kid Andrew W.K. joins the enterprising
L.A.-based Calder String Quartet at Le Poisson Rouge tonight.  On the program: Bach, Cage, Riley and Glass, plus works by
Mr. W.K. himself.  Equally at home playing Beethoven in concert halls and rock
shows with bands like the National and The Airborne Toxic Event,
the Calder is sure to raise the roof.  At 158 Bleecker St. Information: +1-212-505-3474;
