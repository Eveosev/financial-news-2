The lira strengthened for the first
time in three days after  Turkey ’s central bank governorErdem Basci said the currency will gain this year and the bank sold
$250 million in its auctions.  The lira climbed 0.3 percent to 1.8755 per dollar at 4:28
p.m. in Istanbul. The currency depreciated to a record low of
1.9224 per dollar Dec. 28, prompting the bank to sell the U.S.
currency directly in the market for four consecutive days, the
longest streak since 2001.  Investors in the lira will make a profit in 2012 because
the central bank will allow the currency to gain, Basci said in
a speech in the western city of Bursa today. The lira tumbled 18
percent last year, the worst decline of any emerging-market
currency, even as the central bank said it spent at least $15
billion of reserves to defend the currency.  “After heavy interventions in the foreign-exchange market
Governor Basci’s comments could be perceived as a very strong
verbal intervention,”  Ozgur Altug , chief economist at BGC
Partners in Istanbul, said in a client note.  The bank sold $250 million today, including $150 million in
additional auctions. It conducts additional auctions on days in
which a tighter monetary policy is deemed necessary. The amount
on offer in supplementary auctions is $50 million, it said in an
e-mailed statement today.  [bn:WBTKR=TRABNBM:IND]   Yields [] on two-year benchmark debt fell 16 basis points, or
