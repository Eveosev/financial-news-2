Indian stocks advanced this week on
speculation the central bank may cut borrowing costs to stoke
economic growth as inflation slows.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the owner of the world’s largest
refining complex, surged the most in three weeks.  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover,
climbed for a fifth day, extending the weekly surge to 14
percent.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s biggest lender,
dropped for a third day after Chairman Pratip Chaudhuri said its
loan to  Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR)  has turned bad.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.1 percent
to 15,867.73 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The gauge added
2.7 percent this week, the most since the period ended Dec. 2.
The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of  India 
rose 0.1 percent to 4,754.10. Both indexes erased an intraday
loss of 1.2 percent after shares of Reliance Industries and
companies controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani rallied in the
last hour of trade.  “It’s a great time to get out of cash and get into debt
and equities,” Bharat Iyer, head of India research at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., told Bloomberg UTV today. “Growth is still going
to be a challenge but perhaps it’s priced in. Policy is
beginning to change on the margin, be it monetary policy or be
it government policy.” There’s a “50-50 kind of probability”
of a rate cut by the central bank this month, he said, adding
that Indian stocks may return 15 percent to 20 percent in 2012.  The Sensex slumped 25 percent in 2011 on concern a falling
rupee and record rate increases will worsen the effects of the
European crisis on profits earnings in the European Union’s
largest trading partner. The gauge trades at 13.8 times future
profits, down from 19.4 times at the end of 2010. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index is valued at 9.5 times.  ‘Quick Reversal’  The  Reserve Bank  of India paused on  interest rates  last
month after a record 13 increases since mid-March 2010, as the
benchmark gauge of  inflation (INFINFY)  dropped to a one-year low of 9.11
percent in November. Weekly food-price index fell 3.36 percent
in the week ended Dec. 24, the trade ministry said yesterday.
That’s the lowest level in at least 5 1/2 years.  “The monetary cycle has peaked,”  Subir Gokarn , the RBI’s
deputy governor, told a conference in Singapore yesterday.
“That does not necessarily say that a quick reversal is in
order because inflation risks are still visible, still high.”  The benchmark  inflation (INFINFY)  has remained above 9 percent for
the past 12 months and is the fastest pace among BRIC nations.  “Monetary policy in 2012 could see a complete reversal
almost independent of inflation,” Nilesh Jasani, an analyst at
Jefferies & Co., wrote in an report dated Jan. 2. “In 2011, the
policy goal was containing inflation. In 2012, this could shift
to the revival of economic growth.”  Ambani Companies  Reliance, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, rallied
2.6 percent to 717.55 rupees, its steepest rally since Dec. 21.
 Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) , the second-largest mobile-phone
operator and controlled by Mukesh’s brother Anil, jumped 5.4
percent to 77.6 rupees, reversing an earlier drop of as much as
4 percent.  Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. (RELI) , the builder of a mass
rapid transit system in Mumbai, climbed 5.1 percent to 378.35
rupees, after falling as much as 3.5 percent earlier.  Reliance
Power Ltd. (RPWR)  surged 3.7 percent to 73.45 rupees.  Speculation of a press conference by the Ambani brothers
led to a rally in the last hour of trade. On Dec. 28, they
danced and prayed in their ancestral village on the eve of their
father’s 80th birth anniversary in the strongest display of
bonhomie since ending a feud that split the Reliance empire.  Reliance spokesman Tushar Pania denied there was a press
meet scheduled. Rohit Khanna, a spokesman for Reliance
Communications, didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Best Performer  Tata Motors added 0.7 percent to 203.6 rupees, extending
this week’s rally to 14 percent, the best performance on the 30-
member Sensex.  HDFC Bank Ltd., (HDFCB)  the third-biggest lender,
increased 2.2 percent to 453.3 rupees.  State Bank  fell 1.2 percent to 1,672.75 rupees, extending
last year’s 42 percent slide. Kingfisher slumped 4.7 percent to
19.5 rupees. The stock had tumbled 68 percent last year.  A 15-billion rupee ($280 million) debt to the airline has
been classified a “non-performing asset” on Dec. 31, State
Bank Chairman Pratip Chaudhuri said after the market closed
yesterday. The lender is Kingfisher’s largest creditor and  owns (KAIR) 
5.7 percent of the airline.  Bharti Airtel plunged 4 percent to 330.55 rupees.  Wipro
Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest software services provider, decreased
2.2 percent to 405.75 rupees.  Overseas  investors (FIINNET)  bought a net  5.49 billion rupees (FIINNET$)  ($104
million) of local stocks on Jan. 5, becoming net buyers of 10
billion rupees of shares this year, the  Securities & Exchange
Board of India  show said. They sold $512 million from equities
in 2011, compared with a record inflow of $29.4 billion in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
