Malaysian police gave supporters of
Anwar Ibrahim permission to rally near Kuala Lumpur’s  High Court 
on Jan. 9 as it delivers a verdict in the opposition leader’s
sodomy trial.  The organizers must ensure any gathering is held peacefully
without disrupting public order and safety, the city’s Police
Chief Mohmad Salleh said in a statement released via Facebook.  Anwar faces as many as 20 years in prison if found guilty
of sodomizing a former aide. A conviction may deprive the
Southeast Asian nation’s diverse opposition coalition of a
unifying figure ahead of general elections that must be called
by June 2013.  Police gave the go-ahead for the rally to be held in a car
park outside the court after Mohmad today met Azmin Ali, deputy
president of Anwar’s People’s Justice Party, according to the
statement. Azmin earlier called for 100,000 supporters to
peacefully gather at the court, the New Straits Times reported
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
