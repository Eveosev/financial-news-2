Ecuador ’s consumer prices rose the
most in three years in 2011 as costs of imported food climbed,
while wage increases and  job creation  boosted consumer demand.  Prices (EDCPYOY)  climbed 5.41 percent, the most since 2008’s 8.83
percent increase and compared with 3.33 percent in 2010, the
National Statistics and Census Institute reported today.
Inflation eased from 5.53 percent the month before, the first
decline in 11 months.  Prices climbed as costs of imported staple food such as
corn rose, while increased spending on public works projects and
government employees boosted consumer demand, said Vicente Albornoz, director and head economist of the Cordes research
institute in  Quito . The 2011 increase was bigger than the 5.3
percent average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “First, there is imported inflation,” Albornoz, who
predicts prices will increase by about 5 percent this year, said
by phone from Quito yesterday. “You’ve also got a lot of money
coming into the country that is spent on goods and services and
that is generating the local part of inflation.”  Producer prices, which fell 1.48 percent in December from
November, climbed 3.1 percent last year, the report said.  Consumer prices rose most in the cities of Ambato and
Manta, where they climbed 6.42 percent. In Guayaquil, the Andean
nation’s largest city, prices increased 4.68 percent, the agency
said.  Inflation in Ecuador, which uses the  U.S. dollar  as its
official currency, is forecast to slow to 5.14 percent this
year, while the economy may expand 5.35 percent, according to
the  Finance Ministry ’s 2012 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
