Japan ’s government will consider
taking control of the country’s atomic power stations unless
private utilities assume more responsibility for the risks
involved in their operations, the Yomiuri newspaper reported,
citing Trade and Industry minister  Yukio Edano .  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  and other atomic plant operators
have benefited from lower operating costs, yet the government is
stepping in to help compensate those affected by the Fukushima
nuclear crisis, Edano said in an interview, according to the
Yomiuri.  Japan’s government needs to decide whether to nationalize
nuclear power stations and assume the risks of accidents or make
the country’s utilities pay higher insurance premiums and
shoulder any costs themselves, Edano was cited as saying.  Tokyo Electric is being supported by a government fund to
avoid insolvency as it compensates those who lost their homes
and livelihoods after the disaster at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi
atomic station. A government panel in October said Tokyo
Electric may have to pay 4.5 trillion yen ($58 billion) in
compensation payments by 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
