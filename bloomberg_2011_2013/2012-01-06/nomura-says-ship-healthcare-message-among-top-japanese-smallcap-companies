Nomura Holdings Inc. said  Ship
Healthcare Holdings Inc. (3360)  and nursing home operator Message Co.
are among 10 top small and mid-sized Japanese companies that may
have global investor appeal as they benefit from  Japan â€™s growing
need for elder care.                                           The brokerage also picked Yoshinoya Holdings Co. and Zensho 
Holdings Co. among the top smaller companies. The fast-food 
chains, which serve beef bowls, may benefit from lower costs as 
Japan pursues regional trade agreements, Nomura said yesterday 
in a note to clients.  Nomura also named the following companies as among its
picks:  Ain Pharmaciez Inc. (9627) ,  Lion Corp. (4912) , Daiken Medical Co., 
Dr. Ci:Labo Co.,  UBIC Inc. (2158)  and  PASCO Corp. (9232)   To contact the reporter on this story:
