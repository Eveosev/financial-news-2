Vietnamese  government bonds  rose,
pushing yields to a two-week low, on speculation demand for the
securities have risen. The dong strengthened.  “Demand for bonds increased a little bit since some banks,
which have idle funds, bought the notes on the secondary market
as the State Treasury hasn’t offered any new debt this year,”
said Pham Phuong Lan, the Hanoi-based head of fixed-income and
currency trading at the Bank for Investment & Development of
 Vietnam .  The yield on the benchmark  five-year (GGVN5YR)  bonds climbed four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 12.52 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
That was the lowest level since Dec. 22. The rate dropped three
basis points this week. The dong strengthened 0.1 percent today
and this week to 21,030 per dollar, according to prices from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed its daily reference  rate (SBVNUSD)  at
20,828, unchanged from Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Anil Varma  To contact the reporter on this story:
