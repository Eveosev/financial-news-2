Chile ’s  annual inflation (CNPINSYO)  rate rose to
4.4 percent in December, exceeding the central bank target in a
nation that has the second-highest borrowing costs among major
Latin American rate-setting countries. The peso strengthened.  The median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for consumer prices to climb 4 percent in the year. Prices
rose 0.6 percent from November, compared with the median
estimate for a 0.2 percent gain. Core consumer prices, which
exclude fuel and produce, grew 0.7 percent from November.  The jump in prices comes one month after the central bank
forecast inflation in the top copper-producing nation would slow
to 2.7 percent this year, according to its quarterly policy
report. The bank, which targets inflation of 2 percent to 4
percent over two years, has kept its key  interest rate  at 5.25
percent for six months after raising it five times in 2011.  “The more adverse external panorama that we face will have
consequences for growth and inflation in Chile, as well as the
orientation of monetary policy,” bank President Rodrigo Vergara
told Senators in a speech last month. “Inflation will dwindle
down to about 3 percent in the first half of 2012.”  Annual inflation was the highest since April 2009,
according to central bank data. Chile’s peso appreciated 0.5
percent to 507.63 per  U.S. dollar  as of 8:34 a.m. Santiago time
from 510.17 yesterday.  Policy makers will reduce rates for the first time in more
than two years this month to 5 percent, according to the median
estimate of traders and investors in a Dec. 20 bank survey.
Traders in the survey forecast monthly inflation of 0.1 percent
in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
