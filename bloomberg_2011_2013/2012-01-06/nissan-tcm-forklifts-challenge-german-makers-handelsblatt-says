Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  and  TCM Corp. (6374) ’s new
forklift company UniCarriers plans to challenge  Germany ’s  Kion (KION) 
Group and  Jungheinrich AG (JUN3)  to rank in the industry’s top three,
Handelsblatt said, without saying where it got the information.  UniCarriers, with sales of about 1.5 billion euros ($1.9
billion), will be the sixth-biggest maker of forklifts, the
German newspaper reported. The Japanese venture plans to expand
in  emerging markets  and will have to make acquisitions to reach
its goals, Handelsblatt said, citing unidentified people from
the industry.  Toyota Industries Corp. (6201)  is the world’s biggest maker of
forklifts with more than 5 billion euros in sales from the
division while Kion has about 4 billion euros and Hamburg-based
Jungheinrich’s revenue exceeds 2 billion euros, Handelsblatt
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
