MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,  Africa ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, rebounded in Johannesburg trading as
concerns eased about protests in  Nigeria , the company’s biggest
market.  MTN  climbed (MTN)  as much as 3.9 percent after declining 8.3
percent in the two previous days, the largest two-day drop in
more than two years.  The market over-reacted after Nigeria ended a fuel subsidy
on Jan. 1, which prompted marches across its cities and threats
of strikes by workers,  Ferdi Heyneke , a trader at  Afrifocus
Securities , said by phone today.  Nigeria is MTN’s biggest single market with more than 40
million subscribers contributing 42 percent of the company’s
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.  MTN traded 3.2 percent higher at 136.28 rand as of
