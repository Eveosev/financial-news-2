U.S. stock futures extended gains
after growth in jobs topped estimates last month and the
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly dropped, bolstering optimism in
the world’s largest economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March advanced 0.5 percent to 1,279.1 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York .  The 200,000 increase last month followed a revised 100,000
gain in November that was smaller than initially estimated,
Labor Department figures showed. The median projection in a
Bloomberg News survey called for a December gain of 155,000. The
unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent, the lowest
since February 2009, while hours worked and earnings climbed.  The S&P 500 is up 1.9 percent this week after ending 2011
almost unchanged.  Most U.S. stocks rose yesterday, with the  S&P 500  remaining
at the highest level since Oct. 28, as banks rallied and ADP
Employer Services said payrolls climbed more than forecast,
offsetting reduced profit forecasts at companies including
Target Corp. and J.C. Penney Co.  Alcoa is scheduled to mark the unofficial start of the
fourth-quarter earnings season on Jan. 9. Profit at S&P 500
companies rose 6.2 percent during the September-December period,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, which
would mark the slowest growth since the third quarter of 2009.  U.S. stock mutual funds that invest in domestic equities
had their second-worst redemptions last year as record market
swings sent investors to the perceived safety of bond funds.  Investors pulled an estimated $132 billion from mutual
funds that invest in U.S. stocks, the fifth straight year of
withdrawals for domestic funds, according to preliminary data
from the  Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade
group whose numbers go back to 1984.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
