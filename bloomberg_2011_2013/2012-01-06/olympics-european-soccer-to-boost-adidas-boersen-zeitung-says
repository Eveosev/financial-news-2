Adidas AG, the world’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker, expect a boost in revenue this year from
the 2012  Olympic Games  in  London  and the UEFA Euro 2012 soccer
tournament in Poland and Ukraine,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported,
citing comments by the company’s finance chief Robin Stalker.  Sales this year will rise as much as 9 percent as revenue
from soccer-related gear hits a record high, Stalker said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
