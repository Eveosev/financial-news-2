Cantor Fitzgerald  & Co. asked a U.S.
bankruptcy judge to let litigation proceed against American
Airlines over the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which killed 658
of the securities firm’s employees.  Cantor Fitzgerald, which sued American and parent company
AMR Corp. in 2004, asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in
Manhattan to lift the stay that shields AMR from litigation
while the airline is in bankruptcy, according to a court filing
today.  “The impact of the automatic stay causes significant harm
to Cantor Fitzgerald because it further delays Cantor
Fitzgerald’s ability to recover a portion of the damages it
suffered,” the New York-based company said in the filing.  The litigation is being defended by  American Airlines ’
insurers and can proceed “without any material interference”
with the bankruptcy case, Cantor Fitzgerald said.  Ed Martelle, a spokesman for  Fort Worth , Texas-based
American Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 29,
declined to comment in an e-mail.  The bankruptcy case is AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
