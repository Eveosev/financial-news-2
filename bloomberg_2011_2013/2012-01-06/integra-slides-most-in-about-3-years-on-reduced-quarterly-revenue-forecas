Integra LifeSciences Holdings (IART) , a
maker of orthopedic implants, dropped the most in almost 15
years after cutting its revenue forecast and saying U.S.
regulators cited the company for mold at a factory.  Integra shares  dropped (IART)  20 percent to $24.49 at the close of
trading in  New York , the biggest single day decline slide since
March 1997. The stock has lost 49 percent in the past 12 months.  Revenue in the fourth quarter will be $202 million to $203
million, about 3 percent lower than the company’s previous low
end forecast, because of weaker sales, Integra said yesterday in
a statement. Earnings per share, excluding some items, will be
from 65 cents to 70 cents, the company said. Analysts  projected (IART) 
the company would earn 74 cents, the average of 15 estimates in
a Bloomberg survey.  “The shortfall will raise questions regarding the long
term growth potential for the company,” Matt Miksic, an analyst
with Piper Jaffray in New York, wrote in a note to clients
today. “The announcement will likely prompt investors to re-
think their views of the orthopedic space and utilization of
surgical implants in general.”  In addition, the  Food and Drug Administration  sent the
Plainsboro, New Jersey-based company a warning letter in
December about mold found in an equipment storage area and a
closet that houses filtered water used in manufacturing, Integra
said today in a filing. The letter doesn’t restrict the
company’s ability to make or ship products, Integra said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
