Otmar Issing , the  European Central
Bank ’s former chief economist, described the idea that European
Union member-states should pool their currency reserves as
“shocking,” the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported,
citing a guest commentary.  Issing said using monetary reserves for state funding would
be a “plain breach of contract,” the FAZ reported.  As the European monetary system is a product of political
decisions laid down in European and national law, Issing asked
how likely it is that states will abide by new contractual
agreements when the current law has commanded so little respect,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
