Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the U.K.’s
largest mortgage lender, may post a loss for 2012 because of
higher charges for bad loans, according to analysts at  Barclays
Capital .  Lloyds may set aside 5 billion pounds ($7.75 billion) of
provisions on mortgages for the second half of 2011 through to
the end of 2014 and post a net loss of 292 million pounds, as
the U.K. suffers a “sharper downturn” and slow recovery, said
Rohith Chandra-Rajan, an analyst at Barclays Capital, in a note
to clients today.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s provisions
for mortgages may be less than 1 billion pounds, Barclays
Capital said.  “Rising unemployment, falling household incomes, a fragile
property market and corporate cash flow all challenge a
continued improvement in  credit quality ,” the note said.  U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said today the country is
“in difficult economic times” and that shifting the economy
away from a “debt-fueled boom” is taking time. Unemployment as
measured by International Labor Organization standards rose by
128,000 to 2.64 million, the most since 1994, the Office for
National Statistics said last month.  Lloyds may have a total impairment charge of 20 billion
pounds for the second half of 2011 through to the end of 2014
and RBS 13 billion pounds, Barclays Capital said. The
government-supported banks have posted an estimated 100 billion
of bad loan charges from 2008 through 2011, the analyst said.  Lloyds gained 2.9 percent to 27.13 pence at 2:20 p.m. in
 London  trading, valuing the company at 18.7 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
