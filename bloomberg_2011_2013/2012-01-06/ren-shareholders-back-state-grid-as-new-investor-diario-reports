Portuguese shareholders in  REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA (RENE)  including Gestmin SGPS SA, Logoplaste-
Gestao e Consultoria Financeira SA and Oliren SGPS SA support
State Grid International of  China  becoming a new investor in the
company, Diario Economico reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  The  Portuguese government  on Dec. 15 said it approved State
Grid and two other companies as bidders in the planned sale of
stakes in REN, the operator of the countryâ€™s electricity and gas
grids. Portugal plans to sell a stake of as much as 40 percent
in REN and bidders must present binding proposals to buy 5
percent to 25 percent.  State Grid is interested in buying 25 percent of REN and is
offering more than 3 euros a share, the Portuguese newspaper
said, citing an unidentified person close to the process.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
