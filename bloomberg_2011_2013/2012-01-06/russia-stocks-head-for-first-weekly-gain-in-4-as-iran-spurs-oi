Russian stocks rose, extending their
first weekly advance in four, as a U.S. jobs report showed
hiring in the world’s largest economy increased more than
expected in December, spurring demand for riskier assets.  The 30-stock  Micex (MICEX)  index climbed 0.4 percent to 1,440.60 at
the close in Moscow, extending its weekly gain to 2.7 percent.
OAO  Rosneft (ROSN)  and OAO Lukoil, Russia’s largest oil companies, both
moved higher as Urals crude gained as much as 0.6 percent to
$111.05 a barrel.  U.S. employers added 200,000 to their payrolls in December,
according to the Labor Department, more than the gain of 155,000
forecast by the median projection in a Bloomberg News survey.
The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent, the
lowest since February 2009.  “Russian stocks are so cheap, and assuming  Europe  doesn’t
do very badly over the next year, many of them are due a
rebound,” Arjun Jayaraman, who manages $400 million in
emerging-market equities at Causeway Capital Management in  Los
Angeles , said in a phone interview.  The Micex trades at 5.4 times analysts’ earnings estimates
for member companies, the lowest among the so-called BRIC
nations which include  Brazil , India and  China . The index lost 15
percent in 2011, compared with an 18 percent slide for Brazil’s
Bovespa index, which trades at 9.2 times estimated earnings
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite
Index trades at 8.7 times estimated earnings, and the BSE India
Sensitive Index has a ratio of 13.8.  Mobile Telesystems  Mobile carrier  OAO Mobile Telesystems (MTSS)  led gains in Russian
stocks, climbing 5 percent to 198.56 rubles.  “The Russian mobiles have been among the strongest
earnings outlooks for this year,” said Zoltan Palfi, a London-
based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, who has an
“outperform” rating on MTS.  Rosneft and  Lukoil (LKOH)  rose 1.1 percent 221.22 rubles and 1.2
percent to 1,740.60 rubles respectively.  The Russian markets are open during the country’s New Year
holiday until Jan. 10. A total 21.9 billion shares were traded
on the Micex yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
compared with a daily average of 46.7 billion last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
