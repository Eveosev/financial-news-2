Colombian consumer prices rose 0.42
percent in December, the national statistics agency said.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.73 percent, according to the
report posted on the agency’s website today. Economists expected
monthly inflation of 0.3 percent and annual inflation of 3.6
percent, according to the median estimates of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Annual inflation breached the upper limit of the central
bank’s target range in October for the first time since 2009.
 Colombia  targets inflation of 2 percent to 4 percent.  The central bank held the overnight interest  rate (CORRRMIN)  at 4.75
percent Dec. 16, after raising it a quarter point in November.  Inflation expectations are increasingly dominated by supply
shocks related to bad weather, which the central bank lacks
“appropriate tools” to deal with, the bank said Dec. 29.  Floods this year and in 2010 damaged crops and choked off
Farmers’ supply routes, pushing food prices higher. Heavier-
than-average rain, caused by the La Nina weather pattern, will
last through the first quarter of next year, the government has
said.  Fourth quarter data show signs the economy may be cooling,
after growing 7.7 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, its fastest pace since 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
