The dollar strengthened to the
highest level in 15 months versus the euro as U.S. employers
added more jobs than forecast and investors speculated  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis is worsening.  The greenback gained for a fifth week versus the euro in
its longest winning streak since February 2010 amid optimism the
U.S. economic recovery is building momentum. The euro fell
against most major peers, reaching an 11-year low against the
yen. Mexico’s peso rose against all of its most-traded
counterparts.  “The euro is decoupling from the risk-on, risk-off
trade,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at
 Wells Fargo & Co . in New York. “We’ve seen strong U.S. data
helping the euro over the past two years via risk appetite, and
that is changing as a strong report like this sees the euro
falling versus the dollar. This is going to be a theme that will
play out in early 2012.”  The dollar appreciated 0.6 percent to $1.2717 per euro at 5
p.m. in  New York . It touched $1.2698, its strongest level since
Sept. 13, 2010, and rose 1.9 percent on the week. The U.S.
currency slipped 0.2 percent to 76.97 yen after rising earlier
as much as 0.3 percent. It was little changed on the week.  The euro declined 0.7 percent to 97.90 yen after falling
earlier to 97.88 yen, the lowest level since December 2000.  It was the worst week for Europe’s common currency in four
months. The euro lost 1.3 percent against nine developed-nation
peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted  Currency
Indexes (BCWIEUR) , the most since it dropped 1.9 percent in the five days
ended Sept. 2.  Net Shorts  Futures traders increased their bets that the euro will
decline against the dollar to a record high. The  difference (.ECLRG) 
between wagers the shared currency would fall versus those that
it would rise -- so-called net shorts -- surged to 138,909 in
the week ended Jan. 3, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  Stocks retreated, with the MSCI World Index falling 0.5
percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index losing 0.3 percent.
The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials rose
0.5 percent and declined 0.3 percent.  “Caution is still the theme,” said  Greg Anderson , a
currency strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “The solid
jobs report was largely expected. That leaves room for other
issues to take over and dominate markets.”  Government Help  The yen erased losses versus the dollar after Federal
Reserve Bank of New York President  William Dudley  called on the
U.S. government to try new programs to revive the housing market
and said the central bank may still consider ways to spur
growth. He spoke at an economic forum in Iselin,  New Jersey .  The Fed purchased $2.3 trillion of Treasury and mortgage-
related bonds from 2008 through June 2011 in two rounds of
quantitative easing to support the economy.  Today’s payrolls data “should dull whatever is still being
talked about in terms of quantitative easing,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in
New York. “As the  U.S. economy  strengthens, one would expect
that to allay some of the fears surrounding global growth. The
euro’s in a zone of its own at this point,” he said.  Dollar Index (DXY)   The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, rose 0.4 percent to 81.265.  The index may climb to a 17-month high, Gaitame.com
Research Institute Ltd. said, citing trading patterns. The gauge
surpassed the higher range of the so-called Bollinger band
technical-analysis tool yesterday for the first time in three
weeks. The Dollar Index may advance further, given that its 25-
day moving average has risen since November, said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher in  Tokyo . The next target will be 82.591,
and it may rise to 83.559, the level reached in August 2010.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs last month,
following a revised 100,000 gain in November that was smaller
than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a rise of
155,000. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent,
the lowest since February 2009.  The euro had its second weekly loss against the yen before
the  European Central Bank  meets on Jan. 12. Policy makers have
lowered the benchmark  main refinancing (EURR002W)  rate to 1 percent since
November, from 1.5 percent, to support the economy.  Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said today he
understands the weakening of the euro against the yen will have
a significant impact on companies that export their goods to the
region.  Japan  sold the yen three times last year as its strength
threatened to derail an export-led recovery.  Peso, Rand  Mexico ’s peso was the top performer among the dollar’s 16
most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. It appreciated
0.2 percent to 13.7350 to the greenback. South Africa’s rand
gained as much as 0.8 percent to 8.1161 per dollar before
trading little changed at 8.1779.  Canada’s dollar weakened versus most of its major peers
after the nation’s employers added fewer jobs in December than
forecast and the jobless rate rose for a third straight month.
The currency declined 0.8 percent to C$1.0284 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporters on this story:
