The pound reached a 15-month high
versus the euro, heading for a fifth weekly gain, as European
confidence in the economy slid to a two-year low, fueling
concern that troubled nations will struggle to cut deficits.  Sterling declined against the dollar after a report showed
U.S. employers added more workers to payrolls in December than
economists predicted and the jobless rate fell. Gilts rose as
concern over the euro-debt crisis outweighed U.S. employment
gains. An index of executive and  consumer sentiment (EUESEMU)  in the 17-
nation euro area dropped to 93.3 in December from a revised 93.8
the previous month, the European Commission in Brussels said
today.  “The pound is underpinned by demand for sterling assets
while the euro region is still a trouble spot,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS AG in London. “The benefit of
the pound is that the U.K. is not in the  euro zone .”  The pound climbed to 82.39 pence per euro, the strongest
since Sept. 10, 2010, before trading little changed at 82.54
pence as of 4:48 p.m. London time, 0.9 percent higher than last
week. Sterling dropped 0.5 percent to $1.5426 and 118.87 yen.  Ten-year  gilt (GUKG10)  yields fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.03 percent after rising to as high as
2.10 percent immediately after the U.S. payrolls data. The 3.75
percent bond due September 2021 rose 0.225, or 2.25 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,540) face amount, to 115.04. Two-year note
yields were little changed at 0.41 percent. They reached a
record low 0.271 percent on Dec. 30.  U.S. Jobs  Sterling has risen 2.8 percent against a basket of nine
developed-market peers in the past six months, making it the
third-best performer after the Japanese yen and the  U.S. dollar ,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in December following a revised
100,000 gain in November that was smaller than first estimated,
Labor Department figures showed in  Washington . The median
projection in a Bloomberg News survey called for a December
increase of 155,000. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly dropped
to 8.5 percent, the lowest since February 2009.  Gilts declined briefly after the U.S. data and soon
rebounded as concern about the euro debt turmoil drove demand
for the safest assets. U.K. government bonds were also
underpinned after  Fitch Ratings  became the third company in two
months to cut Hungary’s credit ranking to junk. Austrian banks
are among the largest lenders in  Hungary .  Gilts ‘Haven’  “Perhaps there is realization in the market that the euro
debt problem isn’t going to go away any time soon despite
improvement in the  U.S. economy ,” said Marchel Alexandrovich, a
senior European economist at Jefferies International Ltd, one of
21 gilt primary dealers. “ Europe  is a trouble spot and gilts
are a haven asset.”  ECB Governing Council member Klaas Knot said  Germany  should
support raising the European emergency fund to help end the debt
crisis.  “The most important obstacle lies in Germany, not in the
Netherlands,” Knot said in an interview on Dutch public
television last night. “I think that more money is needed and
we will use the time to convince our German colleagues.”  Gilts outperformed German bonds today. The yield  spread (.GBGER10) 
between 10-year gilts and German bunds narrowed to 17 basis
points from 19 basis points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
