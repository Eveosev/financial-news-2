Kenya ’s shilling advanced for a
second day against the dollar following “intervention” by the
 central bank .  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy gained 0.5
percent to 86.60 per dollar by 12:23 p.m. in Nairobi. The
currency ended trading yesterday at 86.99.  “The shilling has strengthened on the back of Central Bank
of Kenya intervention yesterday; some of the momentum is still
coming through today,” Julius Kiriinya, a trader at Nairobi-
based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  Yesterday the central bank accepted all of the 3.5 billion
shillings ($40.5 million) of bids it received for  repurchase
agreements  to curb supply of the local currency, after offering
3 billion shillings of the securities.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.8 percent to 1,602 against
the dollar, its lowest intraday level since Dec. 27.  “Demand is coming in from the oil sector, and traders
seeking to cover their short positions,” Hamis Mwakibete, head
of trading at Commercial Bank of Africa said today by phone from
Dar-es-Salaam, the commercial capital.  Uganda ’s shilling strengthened less than 0.1 percent to
2,454 against the U.S. currency.  “The market has remained flat because dollar inflows from
commodity exports and some coming to the non-governmental sector
is balancing the demand by oil importers,” Taib Lubega, a
currency trader at Stanbic Bank Uganda, said by phone today from
Kampala, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
