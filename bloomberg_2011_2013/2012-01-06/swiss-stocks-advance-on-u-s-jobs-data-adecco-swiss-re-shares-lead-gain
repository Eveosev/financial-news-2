Swiss stocks (SMI)  declined for a second
day as concern about how euro-area leaders will stem the
sovereign-debt crisis outweighed a better-than-forecast U.S.
payrolls report.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Switzerland ’s second-largest bank,
led a drop in financial shares.  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s biggest
supplier of temporary workers, increased 2.2 percent.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, fell 0.2 percent to 6,013.83 at the
close of trading in Zurich, erasing an earlier increase of as
much as 0.5 percent. The gauge still posted a 1.3 percent gain
this week, a third straight advance. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also decreased 0.2 percent today.  “The U.S. can’t exonerate the rest of the world,” said
Emmanuel Soupre, who helps oversee $5.7 billion at Neuflize
Private Assets in Paris. “The problems in  Europe  are chronic.
Foreseeing an improvement in the U.S. doesn’t mean the
improvements will extend beyond America. It’s best to remain
cautious.”  U.S. employers added more workers to payrolls than forecast
in December and the jobless rate declined to an almost three-
year low, showing that the labor market gained momentum heading
into 2012.  The 200,000 increase last month followed a revised 100,000
gain in November that was smaller than initially estimated,
Labor Department figures showed. The median projection in a
Bloomberg survey called for a December gain of 155,000. The
 unemployment rate (USURTOT)  unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent, the lowest
since February 2009, while hours worked and earnings climbed.  Fiscal Coordination  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will meet French President
Nicolas Sarkozy in Berlin on Jan. 9 to discuss increasing fiscal
coordination among euro-area states ahead of the Jan. 30
European Union leaders’ summit.  Swiss  consumer prices (SZCPIYOY)  had their biggest annual drop in more
than two years in December as the economy cooled and the franc’s
ascent lowered import costs.  Prices slipped 0.7 percent from a year ago, the Federal
Statistics Office in Neuchatel said today. That’s the third
straight decline and the biggest decrease since October 2009.
Economists forecast a drop of 0.6 percent, the median of 13
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Credit Suisse lost 1.8 percent to 21.40 francs.  Julius Baer
Group Ltd. (BAER)  sank 3.5 percent to 35.45 francs, the largest decline
since October.  Adecco Advances  Adecco added 2.2 percent to 41.50 francs, the first
increase in three days.  Clariant AG (CLN)  jumped 3.2 percent to 10.52 francs, a fifth
straight advance to the highest level since August. The maker of
plastic additives was added to the European “key calls” list
at UBS AG.  Sulzer (SUN)  AG slipped 0.6 percent to 102.40 francs after the
maker of pumps was rated “underweight” in new coverage at
Barclays Plc.  Kudelski SA (KUD)  sank 8.2 percent to 7.72 francs, the lowest
price in three months, as UBS downgraded the shares to “sell”
from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
