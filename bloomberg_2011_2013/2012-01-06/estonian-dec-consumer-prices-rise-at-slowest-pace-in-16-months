Estonian consumer prices grew at the
slowest pace in 16 months in December as food costs declined.  Inflation (ESCPLMOM)  eased to 3.7 percent from a year earlier, the
smallest increase since August 2010, compared with a 4.2 percent
rise in November, the Tallinn-based statistics office said today
on its website. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
four analysts was 3.8 percent. Prices rose 0.1 percent from the
previous month.  Estonia’s inflation is declining due to easing global food
and fuel prices, which affect the newest euro-area member more
than most European countries because of its relatively lower
incomes and northern location, according to the central bank and
the  Finance Ministry .  The ministry said last month that it expects inflation to
accelerate “temporarily” in January after the national gas
company AS Eesti Gaas and power utility AS Eesti Energia both
announced plans to raise rates from the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
