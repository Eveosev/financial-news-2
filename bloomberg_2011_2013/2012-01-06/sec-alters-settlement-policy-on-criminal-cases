The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has modified its boilerplate settlement language to
require that defendants admit wrongdoing when they have already
done so in parallel criminal proceedings.  The change doesn’t affect the SEC’s typical approach of
settling cases without requiring the subject of the action to
admit wrongdoing when there is no criminal conviction, SEC
Enforcement Director  Robert Khuzami  said today in a statement.  “The new policy does not require admissions or
adjudications of fact beyond those already made in criminal
cases, but eliminates language that may be construed as
inconsistent with admissions or findings that have already been
made in criminal cases,” Khuzami said.  The SEC has come under fire for allowing subjects of
lawsuits to settle claims without admitting to the misconduct.
U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff cited that policy last
month when he rejected the agency’s proposed $285 million
settlement with Citigroup Inc. over claims the bank misled
investors in a financial product linked to risky mortgages.  The policy change, which has been under consideration for
several months, is “separate and unrelated to” Rakoff’s ruling
in the Citigroup matter and has no impact on cases with no
parallel criminal proceeding, Khuzami said.  Peter Henning , a former SEC attorney who is now a law
professor at  Wayne State University  in  Detroit , said “given the
admission of guilt in the criminal case, it’s hard to see how
this would have any impact.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
