Robert Walters Plc (RWA) , a U.K.-based
international recruiting company, plans to boost hiring in China
and Indonesia as growth in profit in  Asia  outpaces the company’s
U.K. home market.  There is “huge potential” in markets including Bangkok
and Kuala Lumpur, where the company plans to focus on increasing
productivity, Chief Executive Robert Walters said in a phone
interview in London.  Asia Pacific accounted for almost half the company’s gross
profit of 46.4 million pounds ($72 million) last year, the
London-based company said today in a Regulatory News Service
statement. Profit climbed 16 percent in the Asia Pacific region,
24 percent in Europe, 18 percent in the Americas and  South
Africa , and 3 percent in the U.K.  Robert Walters  recently opened an office in Taipei, Taiwan,
and is handling “business as usual” in Australia, the
company’s biggest market, the executive said. The company has no
plans to hire in the U.K. or France, because of “weak client
confidence,” and may reduce staffing in other markets, he said.  “It’s going to be tough,” Walters added.  Robert Walters shares rose as much as 3.1 percent and
traded up 1.1 percent at 164.75 pence at 10:32 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
