The  U.S. Supreme Court (1000L)  agreed to
consider whether police need a search warrant before bringing a
drug-sniffing dog to the front door of a house where officers
suspect marijuana is being grown.  The justices today said they will hear an appeal from
Florida officials seeking to revive the prosecution of a man
arrested after police raided a Miami house and found marijuana
plants.  The Florida Supreme Court said prosecutors couldn’t use
evidence obtained in the house because officers violated the
U.S. constitutional ban on unreasonable searches.  Miami-Dade police began focusing on the house after
receiving a tip that Joelis Jardines was growing marijuana
there. A month later, two detectives went to the front porch
with a drug-sniffing dog, who “alerted” at the door. One of
the detectives said he also noticed the smell of marijuana.  The officers then left to get a search warrant before
entering the house and discovering the plants. Jardines was
charged with trafficking of cannabis and stealing electricity to
grow the marijuana.  The case is Florida v. Jardines, 11-564.  To contact the reporter on this story:
