Denmark will work for a “responsible
 Europe ” with budget discipline as it takes over the rotating
European Union presidency at a time of crisis, Prime Minister
Helle Thorning-Schmidt said.  Budget discipline is “the prerequisite to regain the trust
of the markets,” the premier said today at a press briefing in
Copenhagen. The Nordic country will also prioritize boosting
economic growth, promoting green-energy investments and
improving safety for the bloc’s citizens, she said.  Denmark, which has opted out of the euro, took over the
presidency on Jan. 1, as the region struggles to contain a debt
crisis in the common currency bloc. EU leaders last month
created a blueprint for a tighter financial union in their
latest attempt to stem the region’s two-year-old debt crisis.  Denmark  has promised to contribute 40 billion kroner ($7
billion) as part of plan by EU countries to channel money to the
 International Monetary Fund  to fight the crisis.  Danish voters first rejected the Maastricht Treaty in a
1992 referendum and the country subsequently opted out of four
elements of the treaty: the euro, European citizenship, defense
cooperation and legal cooperation. In 2001, voters rejected euro
membership in a second referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
