Alan Krueger, the top economist for
President  Barack Obama , said the gain in jobs last month shows
the economy is moving in the right direction and shows the need
to extend the payroll tax cut for all of 2012.  “We’re digging our way out of a very deep hole,” Krueger,
chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said
on Bloomberg Television. “The president has targeted the right
course for the economy.”  Extending the payroll tax cut for the rest of year and
spending on infrastructure and aid to states are among the steps
needed to assure continued growth, he said.  The Labor Department today reported that the  unemployment
rate (USURTOT)  fell to 8.5 percent last month, the lowest since February
2009, as hours worked and earnings climbed.  Employers added a net 200,000 jobs in December, more than
expected. That followed a revised 100,000 gain in November that
was smaller than initially estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
