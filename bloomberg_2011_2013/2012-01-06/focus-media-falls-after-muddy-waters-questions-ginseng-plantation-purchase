Focus Media Holding (FMCN)  Ltd., a digital
advertising company in China, sank the most in seven weeks in
New York trading after short-selling firm  Muddy Waters  LLC
questioned an acquisition.  The company’s American depositary receipts dropped 5.4
percent to $18.63 as trading closed in New York, the biggest
decline since Nov. 21.  The acquisition by Focus of a ginseng plantation at the
Russian and North Korean border was “bizarre,” Muddy Waters
said in a  report  on its website today. One of the selling
shareholders included at least one employee of Focus, the report
said, adding the company has “deliberately” overpaid for
“numerous acquisitions,” an assertion it first made in
November.  Focus Media, following Muddy Waters’s report, issued a
statement to “entirely” deny the allegations. It said the
“insignificant” transaction of a regional distributor in
northeast  China  was “to expand the company’s display network.”  Focus Media, based in  Shanghai , added it will disclose more
information about the transaction next week, according to its
statement.  Muddy Waters said in a November report that Focus was
overstating the size of its advertising network and overpaid in
its purchases. Focus reported on Dec. 22 a second survey result
by market research company Synovate which showed that the number
of LCD screens and poster frames Focus claimed to have by Nov.
28 was more than 99.95 percent accurate.  The ADRs of Focus Media have slumped 27 percent since Muddy
Waters’s first report Nov. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
