Canada ’s  unemployment rate (CANLXEMR)  rose for a
third month in December, the longest advance in two years, as a
gain in jobs trailed growth of the  labor force .  The jobless rate increased to 7.5 percent from November’s
7.4 percent and the recent low of 7.1 percent in September,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.  Employment (CANLNETJ)  rose by
17,500, the first gain in three months. Over the past six
months, the number of jobs has grown by 7,400, compared with a
gain of 191,800 in the first half of 2011.  The labor market may stay stalled in 2012 with unemployment
averaging 7.4 percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists taken last month. Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said
“the news isn’t all good” in today’s report, speaking to
reporters in  Edmonton ,  Alberta .  “Job growth has cooled,” said  Doug Porter , deputy chief
economist with BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, by telephone. “I
wouldn’t at all be surprised if we are averaging 10,000 jobs a
month, which won’t cut into the unemployment rate at all” over
the next six months, he said.  The U.S. reported a 200,000 increase in payrolls for
December, higher than the median economist forecast of 155,000,
and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 8.5 percent from
8.6 percent. Canada’s jobless rate has been below that of the
U.S. since October 2008.  Bond Yields  Bond yields fell after the Canadian report. The yield on
the two-year benchmark Canadian government bond declined 2 basis
points to 0.94 percent at 2:47 p.m. Toronto time. The three-
month overnight index swap rate, which measures what investors
expect the central bank’s key policy rate will average over that
period, was unchanged at 0.98 percent.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.7 percent to C$1.0267 per
 U.S. dollar . One Canadian dollar buys 97.40 U.S. cents.  Full-time jobs fell by 25,500 in December while part-time
employment rose by 43,100, Statistics Canada said today. Self-
employed workers increased by 31,100, while workers classified
as employees fell by 13,600.  Private-sector employment increased by 3,800 and public-
sector jobs fell by 17,300.  Employment in the federal government may be curbed by
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty’s pledge to eliminate a  budget
deficit  by the fiscal year starting April 2015, in part by
cutting annual government operating expenses by at least C$4
billion ($3.9 billion).  Trimming Labor Costs  Some companies are also seeking to trim labor costs.
Caterpillar Inc., the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, and Rio Tinto Group locked out workers at plants in
Canada last weekend after labor talks broke down.  Cangene Corp. said today it’s firing about 120 workers, or
17 percent of its staff, because of reduced demand. The
pharmaceutical company is based in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  “The jobless numbers continue to rise and this government
is still sitting on its hands,” Claude Patry, a lawmaker with
the opposition  New Democratic Party , said in a statement.  Manufacturing employment rose by 30,400 in December,
followed by a 16,100 gain for professional, scientific and
technical service workers,  Statistics Canada  said.  Employment in finance, insurance real estate and leasing
fell by 14,500 and construction jobs decreased by 12,800. In the
second half of 2011, finance industry employment fell by 49,300
and construction employment was up by 4,800.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast an
overall December job gain of 20,000 and a 7.4 percent jobless
rate. The 17,500 gain in employment was smaller than the 23,600
monthly increase in the labor force.  ‘Play It Safe’  “Canadian businesses continue to play it safe amid global
risks,” said Jimmy Jean, a strategist in the fixed-income group
at Desjardins Capital Markets in  Montreal  in a note to clients.
“We expect them to continue doing so for a while.”  Canada added 199,200 jobs last year, following a 2010
advance of 298,100 and a 2009 decline of 198,300. The
 unemployment rate  of 7.5 percent for December compares with 7.6
percent at the end of 2010 and 8.5 percent at the end of 2009.  Average hourly  earnings (CAHEPERM)  of permanent employees rose 2.4
percent in December from a year earlier. The  Bank of Canada  says
that figure is a key indicator of inflation.  “We are quite exposed” to global weakness, said  Mark Chandler , head of fixed income strategy at Royal Bank of
Canada’s capital markets unit in Toronto, adding people
shouldn’t expect an “extraordinary return in terms of jobs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
