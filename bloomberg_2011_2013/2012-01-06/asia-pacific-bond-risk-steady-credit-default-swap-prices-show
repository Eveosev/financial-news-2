The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default is little changed
from yesterday’s closing prices, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia (ITRXAGE)  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was steady at 204.5 basis points as of
8:35 a.m. in  Hong Kong , BNP Paribas SA prices show. The index
rose yesterday and on Jan. 4 after dropping 7 points on Jan. 3,
the first trading day of the year, according to data provider
CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia (ITRXAAE)  index traded at 179.5 basis
points as of 11:44 a.m. in Sydney, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, matching the bank’s last price on Thursday.
The gauge ranged between 100 and 239 basis points in 2011,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan (ITRXAJE)  index was unchanged at 193 as of
9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
