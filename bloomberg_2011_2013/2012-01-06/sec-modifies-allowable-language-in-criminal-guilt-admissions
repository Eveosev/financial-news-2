The Securities and Exchange
Commission modified its allowable language policy to eliminate
“language that may be construed as inconsistent with admissions
or findings that have already been made in the criminal cases,”
the agency announced in a release.  The policy applies to cases involving parallel criminal and
SEC charges and removes the “neither admit” provision from the
agency’s traditional “neither admit nor deny” approach, the
release said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
