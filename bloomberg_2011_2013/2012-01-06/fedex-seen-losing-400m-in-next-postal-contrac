FedEx Corp. (FDX) , the delivery company
that is both a partner and rival to the U.S. Postal Service, may
see a federal mail-flying contract drop by more than 27 percent
in 2013 as the agency restructures.  Revenue from carrying Postal Service express, priority and
first-class mail in FedEx cargo jets may shrink to less than $1
billion annually once the current agreement expires and a new
accord is negotiated, according to Satish Jindel, president of
SJ Consulting Group Inc. in Sewickley,  Pennsylvania .  A Postal Service goal of saving $2.1 billion a year isn’t
reachable “without making some changes in the way they move
things,” Jindel said in a telephone interview. That is “likely
to result in a reduction of the number of packages that they
will need transported by air.”  The risk to mail flying spotlights the ties binding the
U.S. agency to its  largest supplier (FDX)  -- the company founded in
1971 by Chief Executive Officer  Fred Smith  to speed air-freight
shipments. U.S. government sales make up about 3.7 percent of
FedEx’s annual total, data compiled by Bloomberg indicate.  Postal Service Chief Financial Officer Joseph Corbett has
said the agency will cut mail sent by air by boosting ground
shipments, without giving details. Regulators discussed the
agency’s financial crisis yesterday at a meeting in Washington.  Some savings would come “from changes and cost elimination
for people who handle the mail,” Jindel said. Some “is going
to come from reducing transportation expenditures that they
incur. That transportation total amount is almost $6 billion; of
that, $1.4 billion is being spent on FedEx.”  FedEx Freighters  Freighters from  Memphis , Tennessee-based FedEx help fly
U.S. mail that needs to arrive within a few days. The Postal
Service’s agreements with companies such as FedEx and  United
Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  mean the agency doesn’t have to maintain a
large air-cargo fleet.  “The most likely outcome is that FedEx keeps the priority-
mail contract,”  David Ross , a Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst in
Baltimore, said in an interview. “But maybe it’s at a lower
rate or a lower guaranteed minimum” value because of the Postal
Service’s dwindling mail deliveries.  The agency is struggling with a 2012 loss  projected  at
$14.1 billion. First-class volumes tumbled 29 percent from 2000
through 2011, according to Bloomberg Industries data. CFO
Corbett said in November, “We’re not looking to grow what’s in
the air.”  UPS Estimate  UPS’s mail-flying contract is valued at about  $95 million ,
according to David Hendel, a partner at  Washington  law firm
Husch Blackwell LLP who specializes in postal contracting.
FedEx’s $1.4 billion contract for fiscal 2010 made it the Postal
Service’s biggest supplier, according to Hendel, who compiles an
annual list of top contractors using documents obtained through
the Freedom of Information Act.  FedEx isn’t speculating on the terms of any future
contract, a spokeswoman, Maury Donahue, said in an e-mail. The
company and the Postal Service have “a longstanding and strong
relationship,” she said yesterday. The current agreement was
signed in 2006 and amended several since then, filings show.  Jindel said UPS’s contract to fly mail probably won’t be
cut because the sum is relatively small.  Susan Rosenberg , a UPS
spokeswoman in Atlanta, said, “We believe there needs to be a
successful  Postal Service , and we ourselves are a beneficiary of
that, too.”  Trailing UPS  FedEx has lagged behind UPS for the past one- and  two-year (FDX) 
periods, after surging ahead of its rival immediately following
the bear-market low in March 2009. FedEx slid 10 percent in the
12 months ended yesterday, while UPS was up 0.3 percent and the
broader Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.4 percent.  FedEx doesn’t disclose sales from individual customers,
such as the Postal Service. Revenue for the  fiscal year (FDX)  that
ended in May was $39.3 billion. The Postal Service and FedEx
operate on different fiscal years.  Over time, the company may benefit from the Postal
Service’s continued shrinkage, said  Art Hatfield , a Morgan
Keegan & Co. analyst based in Memphis, who like Stifel
Nicolaus’s Ross recommends buying UPS and FedEx shares.  “Any time any competitor, theoretical or direct or
indirect, lowers their level of service, it’s going to benefit
everybody else,” Hatfield said in an interview.  Saturday Gain  Consultant Jindel projected that Postal Service’s proposal
to end six-day-a-week deliveries may produce a net $15 million
revenue gain for FedEx. The company now has a product known as
SmartPost, in which FedEx moves goods from a shipper such as a
catalog retailer to a postal center for the final delivery leg.  Current SmartPost customers who want to keep Saturday
service could switch to FedEx Home Delivery, which generates an
average of $4.60 more in revenue per package than SmartPost
shipments, Jindel said.  It’s too soon to say what transport companies may pick up
the Postal Service mail shipments being shifted to trucks as the
agency seeks savings, Jindel said. FedEx Ground is one
possibility, he said. What is clear is that Postal Service cuts
and falling volumes mean fewer pieces of mail will make part of
their journey on FedEx planes, he said.  “Air is the most expensive form of transportation,” he
said. “If they’re going to do it right, they must be looking to
bring more of that air to the ground.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
