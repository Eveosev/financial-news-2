Centum Investment Co. (CENTUM) ,  Kenya ’s
largest investment company, gained for a fourth day on
speculation the stock was oversold after the company issued
bonus shares last year.  The shares gained 3.6 percent to 14.55 shillings as of 1:23
a.m. in Nairobi, the highest price since Nov. 22, and giving the
company its longest winning streak since Nov. 2.  “There is a strong demand because the market is trying to
re-rate it; its net present value in 2011 was 18 shillings,”
George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa
Capital Ltd., said by phone today. “The market is coming to the
realization that it is undervalued”.  The stock tumbled 35 percent in 2011, ending the year at
13.5 shillings.  In November, Centum offered one bonus share for every 10
held, resulting in the issue of an additional 60.5 million
shares to stockholders.  “It fell so much last year because of the bonus shares,
which tend to have a dilutive impact when they begin trading,”
Bodo said. “The bonus shares also came at a time when the
market was doing badly and there was a lot of sell-off
regardless of the fundamentals of companies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
