P.K. Chaudhery, secretary of  India ’s
Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, comments on
allowing foreign investment in the nation’s retail industry. He
was speaking to reporters in New Delhi today.  India on Dec. 7 put on hold a decision to allow companies
like  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  to own as much as 51
percent of retailers selling more than one brand.  On multibrand retail:  “The government is in talks with farmers and traders over
the issue of FDI in multibrand retail, and consultations with
these stakeholders are likely to be completed by the month
end.”  On allowing 100 percent foreign direct investment in single
brand retail:  “We will issue a notification soon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
