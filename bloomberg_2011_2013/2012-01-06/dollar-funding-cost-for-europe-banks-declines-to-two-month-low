The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars declined to the lowest in two months, according to
money-market indicators.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was at 102
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 10 a.m. in
 London . That’s the lowest since Nov. 7 and compares with 109
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year basis swap was 89 basis points less than
Euribor, compared with minus 92 basis points yesterday. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps, was at 95 basis points from 94 yesterday. It widened to
101 basis points on Dec. 1, 2011, the biggest gap since January
2009.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits (ECBLDEPO)  at the  European
Central Bank  to a record, placing 455 billion euros ($582
billion) with the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, from 444
billion on Jan. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
