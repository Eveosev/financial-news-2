CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, may spin off its renewable energy operations and
sell a minority stake to investors this year, raising money as
the company seeks to expand into  Poland , Romania and  Germany .  A final decision on the sale, which may be to institutional
investors such as insurance companies and pension funds or via a
stock-exchange offering, will probably be made during the first
quarter, Ladislav Kriz, a CEZ spokesman, said today by phone.  He declined to indicate the probable value of the assets,
which include solar plants and wind farms in the Czech Republic.  “CEZ will likely use the raised cash to further invest
into the renewable energy segment abroad, for example into
Polish windfarms,” Marek Hatlapatka, an analyst at Cyrrus AS,
said in a note today. “We expect keen interest from investors
despite the inherent risk of uncertain regulatory environment.”  CEZ is building a 600-megawatt wind farm in  Romania  and
studying Poland and Germany. The Prague-based utility plans to
build as much as 2,000 megawatts of wind farms in Poland by
2015, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Benes said in November.  The company was little changed at 778 koruna by 10:44 a.m.
in Prague trading, erasing an earlier gain of 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
