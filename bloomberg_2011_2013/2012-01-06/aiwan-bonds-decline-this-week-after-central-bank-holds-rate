Taiwan ’s government bonds fell this
week after the central bank kept borrowing costs unchanged at
the end of last month. The currency advanced.  Benchmark (GVTWTO5)  five-year yields were little changed today after
the monetary authority sold NT$100 billion ($3.3 billion) of
364-day certificates of deposit at an average yield of 0.899
percent, compared with 0.898 percent at the last auction in
December. The government reported yesterday  consumer prices (TWCPIYOY)  rose
2.03 percent in December from a year earlier, more than the 1.15
percent economists estimated in a Bloomberg survey. The central
bank kept its policy rate at 1.875 percent on Dec. 29.  “ U.S. Treasuries  remained quite stable even as we had some
bad news coming out from  Europe , so we’re lacking a clear
direction,” said George Pu, a Taipei-based bond trader at
Sinopac Securities Corp. “The CPI data was heavily affected by
the cost of vegetables, so the effect should be temporary.”  The yield on the 1 percent notes due January 2017 climbed
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, this week to 0.998
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate was
little changed today.  Stock indexes (MXAP)  declined across  Asia  today as higher
borrowing costs in a French bond auction stoked concern Europe’s
debt crisis is deepening.  Taiwan’s monetary authority said at its quarterly meeting
in December that it will keep up the monthly bill auctions to
drain excess funds from the financial system.  The island’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$30.245
against its U.S. counterpart this week, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It advanced 0.1 percent today.  The  overnight money-market rate (NTON) , which measures interbank
funding availability, was at 0.400 percent, compared with 0.405
percent a week ago, according to a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
