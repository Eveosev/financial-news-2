The U.S. doesn’t have a short-term
“deficit problem” and the proof is that “the world is
clamoring to give us money at negative real interest rates,”
former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Alan Blinder  said.  The U.S. isn’t plagued by “generalized overspending,”
Blinder said on a panel at an economists conference in Chicago
today. Health-care costs are the main source of concern, said
Blinder, an economics professor at  Princeton University  in New
Jersey.  The U.S. 10-year government bond yield has been below the
annual inflation rate since May, allowing the government to
borrow at so-called negative interest rates.  Blinder and  Alice Rivlin , a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution in Washington and another former Fed vice chairman,
said the divisive political environment in Washington is hurting
efforts to trim the deficit.  The U.S. needs to address its short-term and long-term
deficits together, Rivlin said. “We need to reassure our
creditors and ourselves” that the U.S. won’t “become  Greece  in
the foreseeable future.”  Both Democrats are Republicans need to tell Americans that
the U.S. retirement system must be changed and Medicare won’t
“survive in its current form,” said  Douglas Holtz-Eakin ,
president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think
tank in Washington.  “We have all the characteristics of countries that get in
trouble,” including high debt and liabilities that aren’t
transparent, such as mortgage debt, he said.  Holtz-Eakin was an economic adviser to U.S. Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
