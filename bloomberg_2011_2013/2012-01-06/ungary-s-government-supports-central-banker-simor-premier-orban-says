Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
said he supports central bank President Andras Simor.  “The President can count on the government’s support,
including our backing for him personally,” Orban said after
meeting Simor today in Budapest.  Orban made the comment after the forint fell to a record
against the euro yesterday. The Internatinal Monetary Fund and
the European Union broke off talks on a bailout last month,
citing a new law they said may undermine central bank
independence.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
