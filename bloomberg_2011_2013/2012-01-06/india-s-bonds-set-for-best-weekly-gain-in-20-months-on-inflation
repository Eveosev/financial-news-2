a year. The monetary authority purchased 84.71 billion rupees
($1.6 billion) of government notes today, after announcing an

at ING Investment Management Pvt. in Mumbai. “The  Reserve Bank 
of India’s debt purchases are also helping overcome pressure
from the large borrowings.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
