Delivery companies such as  FedEx
Corp. (FDX)  and  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  added 42,200 jobs to
payrolls in December, about a fifth of the total for all
employers last month. History indicates the gain will be
followed by a similar-sized loss in January.  A surge in Internet holiday shopping over the past three
years is prompting such companies to take on more truck drivers
and warehouse workers than usual to handle the rush. It takes
time for government statistics to be able to smooth over such
seasonal trends, leading to a see-saw pattern in hiring.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if there will be some payback,”
said  Ethan Harris , co-head of global economic research at Bank
of America Corp. in  New York . “There is a shift toward remote
shopping and seasonal factors aren’t going to pick that up
completely.”  Total payrolls rose by 200,000 in December, a Labor
Department report showed today, beating forecasts by economists.
Private hiring, which excludes government agencies, rose
212,000, the report showed.  A 46,300 jump in payrolls at courier and messenger
companies in December 2010 gave way to a 48,700 drop the
following month, Labor Department data shows. A year earlier,
employment swung from a 30,100 gain to a 40,800 drop.  Online retail purchases rose to a record $37.2 billion in
the November-December holiday period, a 15 percent increase from
2010, Reston, Virginia-based ComScore Inc. said in a statement
Jan. 4.  UPS Plans  Atlanta-based UPS in November said it planned to hire about
55,000 holiday workers this year, a 10 percent increase from
2010, to help with shipping gains bolstered by online shopping.
Its rival,  Memphis , Tennessee-based FedEx, said the prior month
it would hire 20,000 seasonal employees, an 18 percent gain.  The give-and-take in the transportation category shouldn’t
detract from the fact that the labor market is improving, said
Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc. in New York. Stripping out the so-called courier effect,
payroll growth in December would have still come in at around
160,000, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
