Hisashi Iwakuma, a Japanese All-Star
pitcher, signed a one-year contract with the  Seattle Mariners  12
months after failing to reach an agreement to join the Oakland
Athletics.  Iwakuma, 30, became a free agent in  Japan  after nine years
of professional baseball. The right-hander will earn $1.5
million in his first season in  Major League Baseball  with a
further $3.4 million available in bonuses,  MLB.com said , without
revealing where it got the information.  “Iwakuma has been a highly successful pitcher in Japan,”
Mariners General Manager Jack Zduriencik said on the team’s
 website . “We look forward to his contributions to the Seattle
Mariners, as he will be given the opportunity to be part of our
starting rotation.”  The Athletics bid $19.1 million for the right to negotiate
last year with Iwakuma, the Pacific League’s Most Valuable
Player in 2008 when he was 21-4 with a 1.87 earned run average.
He’s 107-69 in 226 career games with Kintetsu and  Rakuten .  Iwakuma was on the disabled list with a sore shoulder from
May 18 to July 26 last year. He went 6-7 in 17 starts for
Rakuten last season, and struck out 90 while walking 19 in 119
innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
