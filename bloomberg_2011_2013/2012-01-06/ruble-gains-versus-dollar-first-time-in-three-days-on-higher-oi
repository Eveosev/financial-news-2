The ruble strengthened for the first
time in three days against the dollar, extending its weekly gain
as Urals crude oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, advanced.  The Russian currency appreciated as much as 1.6 percent
against the dollar, before closing up less than 0.1 percent at
31.99 per dollar, extending its weekly rise to 0.5 percent. The
ruble increased by 0.9 percent to 40.585 per euro, leaving it
0.5 percent higher at 35.8578 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Urals rose 0.6 percent to $111.05 a barrel as tensions over
 Iran  spurred bets supplies of the commodity may fall and U.S.
employers added 200,000 jobs in December, double the revised
100,000 in November and more than the 155,000 median estimate of
economist in a Bloomberg survey.  “The potential remains for a ruble rally against the
dollar on the back of a strong oil price,” Johannesburg, South
Africa-based Tradition Analytics wrote in an e-mailed note.  European foreign ministers aim to announce harsher

industries at its meeting Jan. 30, according to European Union

world’s third-biggest.  “If it weren’t for the geopolitics in the  Middle East , I
would easily see the ruble much weaker,”  Benoit Anne , head of
emerging-markets strategy at Societe Generale SA in  London , said
by e-mail.  Investors pared bets the Russian currency would weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing it at 32.4027 per
