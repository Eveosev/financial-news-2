OCC, which clears and settles all
equity options trades on U.S. exchanges, plans to begin
processing over-the-counter transactions in three  Standard &
Poorâ€™s  indexes this quarter.  The Chicago-based organization will clear trades in the  S&P
500 Index , S&P Midcap 400 Index and S&P Smallcap 600 Index,
according to a regulatory filing dated Jan. 3. The company may
clear transactions that occur away from exchanges based on other
indexes and individual securities in the future, OCC said.  The SEC must approve the request before OCC can clear the
products. The agency requested comments on the proposal.  OCC will determine the margin required from clearing firms
by using its STANS system, which it employs for exchange-traded
options, the proposal said. Over-the-counter options will not be
interchangeable with exchange-traded products, although they
will be among themselves if they have identical terms, OCC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
