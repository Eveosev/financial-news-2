Hong Kong Airlines Ltd. (HKAIRZ) , backed by
 China ’s HNA Group, expects to hold a $300 million initial public
offering in the third quarter of the year as it adds planes to
challenge  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)   The carrier will be listed through a holding company that
will own 100 percent of the airline and of affiliate  Hong Kong 
Express, Kenneth Thong, its head of corporate governance and
international affairs, said today in an interview in the city.
Hong Kong Express is being converted into a budget airline,
while Hong Kong Air will continue offering full-service flights.  Hong Kong Air expects to add more than a plane a month
through 2015 as it builds up its network in a bid to lure
travelers from Cathay, the city’s biggest carrier. The airline’s
plans include the start of all-business-class flights to London
in March and the addition of Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos.  The carrier expects to be profitable on its  London  route
after about two years, Thong said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
The airline, which already flies to Moscow, is also looking to
add services to Frankfurt and Brussels, he said. Hong Kong Air
has also won rights to fly to  Taiwan .  The airline is due to begin receiving its 10 on-order A380s
in 2015, according to the carrier. The planes will be configured
at least 550 seats, Thong said. That will probably include eight
to ten first-class seats, which will be set in individual
compartments, and 100 to 120 business-class seats, he said.  The premium cabins will be on the top deck of the aircraft,
while the lower floor will be used for coach and, possibly,
premium-economy seats, Thong said.  This year, the airline expects to receive 15 planes,
comprising three Airbus A330-200s and 12  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-800s.
That will boost the size of the fleet by eight aircraft, as some
of the 737s will replace older planes.  Hong Kong Air’s parent HNA Group also controls  Hainan
Airlines Co. (900945) , China’s fourth-biggest carrier by market value, as
well as investing in industries including hotels and shipping.  To contact the reporters on this story:
