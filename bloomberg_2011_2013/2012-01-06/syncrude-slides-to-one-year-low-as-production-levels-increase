Syncrude’s discount to West Texas
Intermediate oil widened to the largest in a year as  Alberta 
producers boosted output and ultra-low-sulfur diesel tumbled
last week in  Chicago .  Both  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and Syncrude Canada Ltd. this week
reported output increases in December. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel
in Chicago cost 13.5 cents less than heating oil futures today,
compared with an average of 1.85 cents during the past year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount fell to 25
cents last week, the lowest level in at least five years.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) , a grade commonly used to boost diesel production,
weakened $1.15 to a $1.75 discount to WTI at 4:20 p.m. in  New
York , the lowest level since Jan. 6, 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic
oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$17.90 a barrel, the steepest level in more than five months.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI gained 20 cents to
$11.70 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  added 75 cents to $13
over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium increased $1.80 to $11. Mars Blend
added 50 cents to $8.50 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium widened
$1.25 to $8.25 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) ’s premium gained 25 cents to $7 over
WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 20 cents to $2.10 a
barrel below the benchmark price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
