The  London 2012 Olympics  ticket
resale website has been suspended because of computer issues,
organizers said.  Customers attempting to submit tickets to be resold online
at face value were unable to do so today, leading to the
temporary shutdown.  “We were having a few problems earlier in the day with
customers who wanted to sell their tickets,” a spokesman for
the London organizing committee said. “We’ve suspended that
while we carry out an update of the website.”  It was still possible to buy tickets already listed on the
site despite “a huge amount of demand,” organizers said.  The resale of tickets bought directly from the organizers
runs until Feb. 3 via the buyer’s ticketing account on the
official London 2012 website.  Unsold tickets will be returned to the holder’s account,
with another resale in April. Tickets bought from the organizers
cannot be resold on the open market without the permission.  The organizers were criticized by U.K. consumer groups last
year for the way the event’s 8.8 million tickets were sold. Only
700,000 people were successful in a first-round public ballot,
with 1.2 million missing out. Another sale allowed some of those
to subsequently gain tickets.  Earlier this week, local organizers said a “human error”
was to blame for selling 10,000 tickets too many for the
synchronized swimming competition. Some 3,000 people have been
contacted and offered tickets for different sports, including
swimming and athletics.  To contact the reporters on this story:
