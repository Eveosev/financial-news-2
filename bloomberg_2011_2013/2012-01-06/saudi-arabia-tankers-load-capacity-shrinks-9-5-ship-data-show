The carrying capacity of  oil tankers 
that docked at  Ras Tanura ,  Saudi Arabia ’s biggest crude-loading
port, shrank 9.5 percent last week, according to ship-tracking
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vessels with a combined capacity of 8.6 million deadweight
tons arrived at the facility in the week to Dec. 31, compared
with 9.6 million a week earlier. The ships would be able to haul
about 63 million barrels of crude in total, assuming a
conversion factor of 7.33 barrels a ton. Japan will be the
largest recipient, followed by the U.S.  The following table lists by country the combined
deadweight tonnage of tankers that called at Ras Tanura, based
on signals from the ships’ captains. Saudi Arabia is the world’s
biggest crude exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
