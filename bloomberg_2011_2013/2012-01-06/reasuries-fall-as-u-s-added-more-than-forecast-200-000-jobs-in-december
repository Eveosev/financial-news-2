Treasuries  rose (USGG10YR)  after  Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York President William Dudley said more monetary
accommodation is appropriate even after a report showed the
economy added more jobs than forecast last month.  U.S. debt  fell earlier as the economy added 200,000 jobs in
December, stoking speculation the recovery is accelerating while
 Europe ’s debt crisis weighs on global output. The euro weakened
to a 15-month low against the dollar and yields rose in Italy
and  Spain , reflecting reduced demand for riskier assets. Dudley
said the central bank may consider ways to bolster the economy.
The  Federal Open Market Committee  will meet on Jan. 24-25.  “Maybe Dudley’s comments are an early glimpse of what’s
coming at the FOMC meeting in January,” said  George Goncalves ,
head of interest-rate strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., one of
21 primary dealers that trade Treasuries with the Federal
Reserve. “The doves will try to dominate. They can try to talk
the markets into believing they will be on hold for longer. The
European fear trade is keeping rates artificially lower than
where they should be.”  The benchmark 10-year note  yield (USGG10YR)  fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.96 percent at 5:03 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield rose as
much as five basis points earlier. The 2 percent note due in
November 2021 added 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount, to
100 12/32.  U.S. 30-year bonds rose as much as one point, pushing the
yield down five basis points to 3.02 percent. Treasury 10-year
yields are up eight basis points this week, while 30-year yields
have gained 12 basis points.  Futures Switch  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed to
a net-long position from a net-short position in 10-year note
futures in the week ending Jan. 3, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 6,236 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade.  The previous week, traders were net-short 2,981
contracts.  The Treasury plans to sell $32 billion of three-year notes
on Jan. 10, $21 billion of 10-year securities the following day,
and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Jan. 12. The amounts are the
same as the previous auctions in December.  U.S.  government securities  have handed investors a 0.5
percent loss in January as of yesterday, after returning 9.8
percent last year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  Dealer Holdings  Primary dealer  holdings (PDPPTOTG)  of government securities,  including 
bills, coupon securities and inflation-indexed debt, have
increased to the most since November 2010. The 21 primary
dealers held $74.7 billion of the securities as of Dec. 28. The
firms held $61.6 billion of  Treasury securities (.LTTSYS)  due in more than
one year as of Dec. 28, a record amount.  Treasuries held  in custody (FARBTRSE)  at the Fed for foreign central
banks and other official investors dropped to $2.67 trillion, at
the end of December from $2.73 trillion at the end of November,
according to Bloomberg data.  Treasury market volumes have picked up as about $240
billion of Treasuries changed hands yesterday through ICAP Plc,
the world’s largest interdealer broker. The figure is the most
since Dec. 1. The 2011 daily average was $285 billion.  The Fed bought $4.93 billion Treasuries due in 2018 and
2019 today. It is replacing $400 billion of short-term debt in
its portfolio with longer-term securities through June.  Fed Portfolio  The central bank said it will buy about $45 billion of
Treasuries in January and sell about $44 billion as part of the
program, known by traders as Operation Twist after a similar
effort in the 1960s.  Dudley called on the U.S. government to try new programs to
revive the housing market while saying the central bank may
still consider ways to cut  interest rates .  “Implementing such policies would improve the economic
outlook and make monetary accommodation more effective,” Dudley
said today in a speech to bankers in Iselin,  New Jersey . At the
same time, it’s “appropriate” for the Fed to consider steps to
ease monetary policy, he said.  In separate remarks, Fed Bank of Boston President  Eric
Rosengren  said the central bank could strengthen the  U.S.
economy  by targeting stimulus policies at the housing market,
according to a prepared text of a speech today in Hartford,
 Connecticut .  The gains in jobs last month came after an increase of
100,000 positions in the previous month, the Labor Department
reported today in  Washington . The median forecast of 81
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of
155,000 jobs. The jobless rate fell to almost a three-year low
8.5 percent.  Jobs Gains  The U.S. economy added 1.6 million jobs in 2011, the most
since it produced 2.1 million positions in 2006, Labor
Department data show. The economy lost 8.7 million positions in
2008-2009, Labor Department data show.  “Absent the European sovereign-debt risks, we should be
seeing a yield rally,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income
trading in  New York  at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for
institutional investors. “It seems the economy and labor market
is picking up steam.”  The  spread (USGGBE02)  between yields on two-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices during the life of the debt, widened to 1.73
percentage points earlier today, the most in five months.  Relative Growth  As the world’s largest economy shows signs of
strengthening, the outlook for Europe has deteriorated. U.S.
gross domestic product will grow 2.1 percent in 2012, compared
with 1.8 percent in 2011 and 1.25 percent for all Group of 10
nations, Bloomberg surveys of economists show. The euro-area
economy will contract 0.2 percent, another survey shows.  Yields on the 10-year bonds of  Italy , which has more than
$2 trillion of debt, are above the 7 percent level that preceded
bailouts for  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  from the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  Spain’s 10-year yields headed for their biggest weekly
increase in almost 17 years, climbing by 60 basis points this
week.  “The situation in Europe has created a panic,” said
 Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities USA Inc. “That keeps interest rates low.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
