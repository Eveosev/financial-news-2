A group of Slovenian investors,
including  Sava Group d.d. (SAVA)  and  Zavarovalnica Triglav (ZVTG)  d.d., failed
to attract investors to buy a majority of  Abanka Vipa (ABKN)  d.d.
because of the European banking crisis.  The group of 10 investors has been informed by  ING Groep
NV (INGA) , the adviser to the sale, that it received no binding bids
for the 75.7 percent stake in Slovenia’s third-largest bank,
Kranj, Slovenia-based Sava said in a  statement  to the Ljubljana
stock exchange today.  “The key reason for such a result lies in the current
economic environment, the general crisis in the banking sector
and low interest by foreign companies to make investments in
Slovenia,” Sava said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
