A European Union ban on oil imports
from  Iran  could be delayed to protect fragile euro-region
economies, Reuters  reported , citing unidentified European
officials.  Countries in the 27-nation bloc have agreed in principle to
an embargo and are discussing its implementation, including
whether there should be a “grace period” of as much as a year
for existing contracts, Reuters said. Greece is pushing for the
longest delay, while the U.K., France,  Germany  and the
Netharlands want a maximum of three months, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
