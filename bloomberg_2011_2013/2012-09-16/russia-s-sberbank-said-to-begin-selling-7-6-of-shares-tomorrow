Russia  plans to sell a 7.6 percent
stake in OAO Sberbank, the country’s largest lender, to raise
about 149 billion rubles ($4.9 billion) and will start meetings
with investors tomorrow, said two people with knowledge of the
matter.  Russia is probably seeking a range of 91 rubles a share to
the current trading price for the stake, according to the
people, who asked not to be identified because the details
haven’t been disclosed. The central bank will meet to approve
the pricing today, one person said.  Russia’s government is seeking the sale as part of its plan
to raise 1.5 trillion rubles through 2015, according to the
 Finance Ministry . Bank Rossii, the central bank, holds 57.6
percent of Moscow-based Sberbank and has said it plans to retain
control.  Sberbank shares rose 4.6 percent to 96.99 rubles a share at
the close of Moscow’s Micex Index on Sept. 14. Russia aims to
close the book on the sale on Sept. 17 or Sept. 18, the people
said.  Alexander Baziyan, a spokesman for Sberbank in Moscow,
declined to comment when contacted by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
