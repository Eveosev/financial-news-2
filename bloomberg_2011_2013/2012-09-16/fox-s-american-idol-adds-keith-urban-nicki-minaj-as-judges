Fox TV’s “ American Idol ,” one of
the most-watched U.S. television shows, added country singer
Keith Urban and rapper Nicki Minaj as judges for the series’
12th season, following the departures of Steven Tyler and
Jennifer Lopez earlier this year.  Urban, a four-time Grammy Award winner, will join pop
singer Mariah Carey and musician  Randy Jackson , Fox said in an
e-mailed statement. He’ll be joined by Trinidadian-born singer
and rapper Nicki Minaj, who received a Grammy Award nomination
this year for best new artist, Fox said.  Urban and Minaj will be the ninth and 10th judges in the
history of  “Idol,”  which features amateur singers aiming to be
pop stars. While the singing competition has led in viewership
during the past nine seasons, Fox faces a challenge from other
talent shows, such as NBC Universal’s “The Voice.”  Actress and recording artist Lopez left “Idol” in July
after the departure of rocker Tyler. Lopez and Tyler spent two
seasons together on the show, joining as part of a retooling
after entertainment executive  Simon Cowell  left.  News Corp. (NWSA) , the owner of Fox, rose 1.3 percent to $24.67 at
the close in New York on Sept. 14. The stock has gained 45
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
