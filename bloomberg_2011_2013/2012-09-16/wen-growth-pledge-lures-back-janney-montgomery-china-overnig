Janney Montgomery  Scott LLC is
advising investors to buy Chinese equities for the first time in
two years on prospects Premier Wen Jiabao’s pledge to boost
investments and monetary stimulus will support growth in the
world’s second-largest economy.  “We’re prepared to add as the evidence accumulates that
directionally they’re prepared to become more aggressive to
reflate economic activity,” Mark Luschini, the chief investment
strategist at Janney Montgomery, the 180-year-old Philadelphia
brokerage, said by phone on Sept. 13. “ China  has been reluctant
to act, so these forward-thinking actions have really been the
catalyst for the turnabout.”  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. completed the biggest weekly advance
this year, buoyed by the latest U.S. Federal Reserve steps and
Wen’s comments last week that China still has “ample strength”
in either monetary or fiscal domains to propel growth. Economic
growth decelerated for a sixth time in the second quarter,
 expanding  7.6 percent, the slowest pace in three years.  A combination of expensive stocks and concern growth in the
Asian economy wouldn’t be sustainable drove Janney Montgomery in
August 2010 to recommend investors cut their holdings to zero,
he said. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese
companies traded in  Hong Kong  has declined 17 percent since
then, sending valuations to 8.1 times estimated earnings, 34
percent below its three-year average of 12.19, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘More Bullish Now’  China announced two infrastructure spending plans earlier
this month and the  European Central Bank  plans to buy bonds to
support the euro.  “Of our emerging market exposure, we’ve taken a very
circular strike on Chinese equities,” Luschini said. “I’m more
bullish now on  emerging markets  than I have been in about 18
months.”  Chinese shares traded in  New York  gained 5.7 percent last
week to 93.91, the largest  advance  since the five days ending
Dec. 2.  Commodity producers  were among the biggest gainers as
 Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s largest maker of the
metal, climbed to the highest in four months, and  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,
its biggest offshore oil explorer, advanced to a one-month high.  Oil also rose to a four-month high and  commodities  recorded
their longest run of weekly gains since October 2010 following
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s Sept. 13 announcement that the
U.S. central bank will purchase assets to boost growth.  ETF Rallies  “The actions by central banks in the U.S. and the E.U. are
designed to push investors into risk assets, and emerging
markets will be a beneficiary of that,” Deborah Velez Medenica,
the head of emerging markets at Fred Alger Management Inc.,
which manages about $17 billion, said by phone from New York on
Sept. 14. “Investors are putting their money into laggards
year-to-date, and commodity producers may continue to see
support for prices that have fallen.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 4.5 percent last week to
$35.19, a one-month high. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose
on Sept. 14 to the highest level since 2007, climbing 0.4
percent to 1,465.77.  Aluminum for three-month delivery rose for the 11th
straight session, gaining 4.7 percent on Sept. 14 to $2,200 a
ton on the London Metal Exchange, the longest rally in at least
25 years.  Oil at $99  American depositary receipts of Aluminum, also known as
Chalco, jumped 12 percent last week to $11.06, the highest level
since May 8. Cnooc’s ADRs climbed 9.5 percent for the week to
$204.07, the highest in a month.  Crude oil for October delivery increased 0.7 percent to
settle at $99 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after
rising as much as 2.1 percent to touch $100.42 on Sept. 14. The
S&P GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities increased 2.6 percent to
694.21 last week.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) , China’s fourth-largest producer of
the fuel, gained 8.3 percent last week to a four-week high of
$15.99.  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , the biggest real estate
information website in China, advanced 9.4 percent for the week
to $14.73 while  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of China’s most-popular online
search engine, advanced 5.5 percent in that same period to
$115.62, a two-week high.  To contact the reporters on this story:
