The  New York Yankees  reclaimed solo
possession of first place in the American League East, beating
the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 as the  Baltimore Orioles  fell 5-2 in
Oakland.  Ivan Nova allowed two runs in six innings on the mound and
 Curtis Granderson  and  Eduardo Nunez  hit back-to-back home runs
yesterday as New York beat Tampa at Yankee Stadium.  Nova, making his first appearance since Aug. 21 because of
a shoulder injury, struck out eight, walked two and allowed four
hits, including a solo homer by  Evan Longoria , to raise his
record to 12-7 this season.  James Shields  (14-9) took the loss
for Tampa, giving up four runs on six hits in 6 1/3 innings.  The win moved New York’s record to 82-63, a game ahead of
the Orioles (81-64), who lost to the Athletics as Baltimore’sZach Britton (5-3) lasted four innings, giving up five runs on
four hits, including a homer by Stephen Drew.  Jarrod Parker (11-8) earned the win for the Athletics (84-
61), who drew within two games of the Texas Rangers in the AL
West. Texas (86-59) fell 8-6 to the Seattle Mariners.  Oakland and Baltimore lead the race for the AL wild cards,
which go to the top two non-division winning clubs. The Los
Angeles Angels, who lost 3-2 to the Kansas City Royals, are 79-
67, 2 1/2 games behind the Orioles for a wild-card spot. Tampa
(78-67) is three back and the Detroit Tigers, who beat the
Cleveland Indians 5-3, are 3 1/2 games off the pace.  Both Detroit’s Anibal Sanchez and the Chicago White Sox’s
 Francisco Liriano  took no-hitters into the seventh inning
yesterday. The White Sox, who beat the Minnesota Twins 5-3, are
one game ahead of the Tigers in the AL Central.  In other action,
the  Boston Red Sox  beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2.  NL Race  In National League play yesterday, the Los Angeles Dodgers
beat the St. Louis Cardinals 4-3 to draw even in the race for
the league’s second wild card.  Both teams are 76-70 after Luis Cruz hit a two-out run-
scoring double in the bottom of the ninth inning and pinch-
hitter Juan Rivera followed with game-winning single.  Jason Motte (4-5) blew the save attempt for St. Louis after
retiring the first two Dodgers’ batters he faced.  Joe Blanton  started the game for Los Angeles after the team
announced that reigning Cy Young Award winner  Clayton Kershaw 
would miss the start because of inflammation in his right hip.
Kershaw, 24, will see a specialist in New York in two days and
might need arthroscopic surgery if the pain continues, the
Associate Press reported.  The Pittsburgh Pirates (73-71), who beat the Chicago Cubs
7-6, are two games back in the wild-card race; the Milwaukee
Brewers (73-72) topped the New York Mets 9-6 and are 2 1/2
behind; and the Philadelphia Phillies (73-73) were shut out 5-0
by the Houston Astros to fall three back.  It was the Atlanta Braves 5, the Washington Nationals 4;
the Miami Marlins 6, the Cincinnati Reds 4; the San Francisco
Giants 3, the  Arizona  Diamondbacks 2; and the San Diego Padres 4,
the Colorado Rockies 3 in National League play.  To contact the reporter on this story:
