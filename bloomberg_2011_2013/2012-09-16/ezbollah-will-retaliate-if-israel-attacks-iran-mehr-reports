Lebanon’s Shiite Muslim group
Hezbollah will retaliate against  Israel  if it attacks Iran,  Mehr 
reported, citing a top Iranian military commander.  “If the Zionist regime takes any actions against us,
resistance groups, especially Lebanon’s Hezbollah given their
deep role in our defensive strategy, will respond,” Major
General Yahya Rahim Safavi, the Iranian supreme leader’s senior
military adviser said, according to the state-run  news agency .  “The foolishness of the Zionist regime’s officials in
threatening Iran is bringing residents of the occupied
territories one step from the graveyard,” Rahim Safavi said in
Tehran Sept. 14, according to Mehr.  To contact the reporter on this story:
