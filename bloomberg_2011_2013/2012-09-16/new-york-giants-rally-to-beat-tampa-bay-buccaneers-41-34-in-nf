Eli Manning passed for 510 yards as
the Super Bowl-champion  New York  Giants scored 25 fourth-quarter
points to rally past the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 41-34 and avoid an
0-2 start to the National Football League season.  The Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the New York Jets 27-10
yesterday to win their 10th straight opening home game, while
the New England Patriots’ run of 10 straight victories in home
openers ended with a 20-18 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The
San Francisco 49ers beat the Detroit Lions 27-19 to join San
Diego, Houston, Arizona and Philadelphia as the NFL’s 2-0 teams.  The Giants erased a 27-16 fourth-quarter deficit at MetLife
Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, as Manning finished
three yards short of Phil Simms’s franchise record for passing
yards. New York gained 604 yards of offense, second only to the
team’s 609 yards on Dec. 3, 1950.  “As a quarterback you like to throw it,” Manning, who
completed 31 of 51 passes, told reporters. “It’s fun when guys
are getting open and guys are making plays and you’re seeing
things -- you get to fight back.”  The Steelers scored 21 unanswered points in Pittsburgh to
pull away from the Jets, whose offense was limited to 219 yards
a week after a 48-28 season-opening rout of Buffalo.  The  Philadelphia Eagles  became the first team in NFL
history to win their first two games by one point, beating the
Baltimore Ravens 24-23 at home as quarterback  Michael Vick 
scored on a 1-yard run with 1:57 left.  Elsewhere, it was Houston 27, Jacksonville 7; Indianapolis
23, Minnesota 20; Carolina 35, New Orleans 27; Miami 35, Oakland
13; Buffalo 35, Kansas City 17; Cincinnati 34, Cleveland 27;
Seattle 27, Dallas 7; San Diego 38, Tennessee 10; and St. Louis
31, Washington 28. On Sept. 13, the  Green Bay Packers  defeated
the Chicago Bears 23-10.  Broncos-Falcons  The Week 2 schedule concludes tonight when the Denver
Broncos visit the Atlanta Falcons in matchup of 1-0 teams.  At MetLife Stadium, Manning threw two of his three
touchdown passes in the final seven minutes to overcome three
interceptions that led to 21 Tampa Bay points.  The Giants evened their record at 1-1 after losing their
season-opener to the  Dallas Cowboys .  “No one wants to start 0-2,” Manning told reporters.
“Especially after the first half and playing poorly, and last
week not playing well; to get back to that level of playing good
football and that second half was really good.”  After  Lawrence Tynes  kicked his fourth field goal of the
game to pull the Giants within 27-19 less than three minutes
into the final quarter, Manning hooked up with Victor Cruz for
an 80-yard touchdown pass. Andre Brown rushed for the two-point
conversion to tie the score 27-27 with 6:48 left.  Manning Touchdown  Manning also tossed a 33-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett, while Brown scored the winning touchdown on a 2-yard
run with 31 seconds left. Two plays earlier, Manning completed a
50-yard pass to Hakeem Nicks, who finished with 10 catches for
199 yards and a touchdown. Cruz had 179 receiving yards.  The 1951 Los Angeles Rams were the only other team in NFL
history with a 500-yard passer, Norm Van Brocklin, and a pair of
150-yard receivers in Elroy Hirsh and Tom Fears.  At Heinz Field in Pittsburgh,  Ben Roethlisberger  passed for
275 yards and threw touchdown passes to Heath Miller and  Mike Wallace  as the Steelers erased a 10-6 deficit against the Jets
and rebounded from their season-opening loss in Denver.  The Jets scored a touchdown on their opening possession --
a 14-yard pass from  Mark Sanchez  to  Santonio Holmes  -- and then
were limited to one field goal the rest of the way. Sanchez
completed 10-of-27 passes for 138 yards.  49ers Win  The 49ers beat the Lions (1-1) for the ninth straight time
as  Alex Smith  threw two touchdown passes to  Vernon Davis  and
 Frank Gore  rushed for 89 yards and a score.  The Patriots dropped to 1-1 after losing for the second
time in their past 26 games at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro,
Massachusetts. Arizona, which beat the Seahawks last week, had
previously lost 13 of 15 games on the road.  While the Patriots were limited to four field goals by
 Stephen Gostkowski  for the first 57 minutes, the Cardinals got
two field goals from Jay Feely while  Kevin Kolb  threw a 2-yard
touchdown pass to Andre Roberts and ran for a 5-yard score.  New England pulled within 20-18 with 2:49 to play after
quarterback  Tom Brady  found  Rob Gronkowski  from five yards for a
touchdown. The two-point conversion attempt failed.  The Patriots got the ball back with 1:01 left and drove to
the Cardinals’ 24-yard line before Gostkowski missed a 42-yard
field goal attempt with one second remaining.  “There’s no one play that lost the game,” said Brady, who
passed for 316 yards and was intercepted once. “We did a lot of
things that allowed us to lose this game. We had a lot of
opportunity out there to make more plays than we did.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
