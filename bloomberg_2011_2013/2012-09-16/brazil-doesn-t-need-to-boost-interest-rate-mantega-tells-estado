Brazil doesn’t need to increase its
interest rates next year as inflation will remain under control
even as the economy grows, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told
newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo in an  interview .  Mantega said the government’s recent tax cuts and measures
to reduce electricity costs together with an increased supply of
goods and services during the global economic crisis will keep
prices under control, Estado said. Brazil won’t allow the real
to strengthen after the  Federal Reserve ’s third round of
quantitative easing in the U.S. was announced Sept. 13, he said,
according to the newspaper.  Banks in Brazil are charging “crippling” credit-card
rates, which the government views with concern, Mantega said in
the Estado interview.  The minister also said the government is not considering
raising fuel prices in the short term to improve the finances of
the state-controlled oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Estado
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
