Saudi Arabia  is in talks about
connecting its power grid with Turkey and is studying a possible
link with Egypt, the governor of the Persian Gulf stateâ€™s
Electricity and Co-Generation Regulatory Authority said.  A tie-up with Turkey would open the door to power
connections with Europe, and international links would create
export opportunities for Saudi producers of renewable energy,
regulatory chief Abdullah al-Shehri told a conference today in
Riyadh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
