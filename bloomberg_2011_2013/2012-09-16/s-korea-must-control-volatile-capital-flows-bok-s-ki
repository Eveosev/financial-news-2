South Korea  must control volatile
capital flows as quantitative easing measures taken in the U.S.
and Europe have a “negative spillover” into emerging
countries, Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said.  “It seems current safeguards against volatile capital
flows are working to some extent,” Kim told reporters in
Incheon, west of Seoul, on Sept. 14. The comments were embargoed
for release today.  The U.S. Federal Reserve on Sept. 13 announced a third
round of quantitative easing as it seeks to boost growth and
reduce unemployment. The measures may spark a new round of
protectionism in Latin America,  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria
SA (BBVA)  said in a Sept. 14 research note.  Europe’s problems need a global solution with more active
participation from emerging economies, Kim said. Emerging
countries need to boost domestic demand to spur growth and help
support the global economy, he said.  The Fed said it would buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed
securities a month to stimulate the  U.S. economy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
