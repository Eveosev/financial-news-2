Sudanese President Umar al- Bashir won’t be arrested during his two-day official visit to
Cairo, Egyptian presidential spokesman Yasser Ali said.  Ali said Egypt is committed to complying with the  African
Union , which last year ordered all its member states not to
cooperate with the  International Criminal Court  in its attempts
to apprehend al-Bashir. The court in 2009 issued an arrest
warrant against the Sudanese leader on charges of committing
genocide, crimes against humanity and  war crimes  in Darfur.  Amnesty International on Sept. 14 called on the Egyptian
government to withdraw its invitation to al-Bashir and to arrest
him if he travels to the capital.  Fighting between rebels and government forces in the
western region of Sudan since 2003 has led to the deaths of as
many as 300,000 people, mainly due to illness and starvation,
and forced about 2.7 million to flee their homes, according to
United Nations estimates. The Sudanese government has put the
death toll at about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
