The Canadian Auto Workers said it
may have developments to report after delaying a press
conference on labor negotiations with  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC, one day before current
contracts expire.  The CAW, representing about about 18,000 employees in the
negotiations, said in a statement today that a Toronto briefing
earlier scheduled for noon local time will be held at 4 p.m. The
union’s current contract expires at 11:59 p.m. tomorrow and the
sides have held more than a month of discussions aimed at
securing a new deal.  “There could be more news,” by the 4 p.m. briefing,
Shannon Devine, a CAW spokeswoman, said by mobile phone today.
“Right now we are meeting with all three companies and we are
not making very good progress. There could be some other
developments by that time.”  The union has begun preparations for a possible strike at
any company without a deal by tomorrow’s deadline, the CAW said
in today’s statement. A strike would threaten production at
eight auto and engine plants in Ontario, where output has fallen
as a rising Canadian dollar has made manufacturing more
expensive in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
