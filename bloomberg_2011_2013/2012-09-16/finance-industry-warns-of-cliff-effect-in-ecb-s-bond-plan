The  Institute of International
Finance  warned that the  European Central Bank ’s plan to buy
sovereign bonds may result in a “cliff effect” if a country
fails to meet conditions tied to the purchases.  Termination of bond purchases could lead to an “abrupt”
market correction, the IIF’s market monitoring group said in a
statement today. Some countries may also be put off from seeking
aid because of the requirements, said the Washington-based IIF,
which represents more than 450 financial companies.  Under the ECB’s plan, which helped drive the euro to a
four-month high on Sept. 14, the central bank would buy
 government bonds  in tandem with  Europe ’s bailout funds to stem
rising borrowing costs if countries ask for help and agree to
conditions. The ECB will also assume oversight of the region’s
banks as early as the start of next year under plans for closer
integration among Europe’s lenders.  A timely implementation of a single banking supervisor will
allow the bailout mechanism to lend directly to the banks and
also help stabilize markets, the IIF said.  The IIF’s risk group, headed by Jacques de Larosiere and
 David Dodge , urged European governments to pursue structural
reforms that will ensure a path to economic growth, echoing
concerns by the ECB that it has only bought nations time to
implement reforms needed to stabilize their economies. Further
delays in reviewing Greece’s budget-cutting plans and unblocking
aid “would be a key source of event risk,” the IIF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
