Sales at major South Korean
department stores declined the most since at least 2005 in
August as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighed on consumer sentiment and
a national holiday fell later in the year.  Outlays at the three biggest chains declined 6.9 percent
from a year earlier in August after a 1.3 percent drop in July,
the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.
 Discount-store sales  slipped 3.3 percent last month, the report
showed. The ministry’s comparable sales data begin in January
2005.  The  Bank of Korea  unexpectedly held borrowing costs
unchanged on Sept. 13 as policy makers paused to consider the
impact of government stimulus measures. Retail sales may rebound
next month on improved sentiment and a more favorable basis for
comparison from a year ago, said Lee Min Koo, an economist at
Eugene Investment & Securities Co.  “Chuseok holiday falls relatively late this year so retail
sales will be better in September when there will be more buying
of gifts and food,” Lee said before the data were released.
“Consumer sentiment is likely to improve for the next few
weeks” because of stock-market gains, he said.  Asian stocks posted the biggest weekly advance in 2012 last
week after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would buy mortgage-
backed securities to bolster economic growth. South  Korea ’s
 Kospi index  gained 4 percent.  The  Finance Ministry  and central bank last week announced a
combined 7.4 trillion won ($6.6 billion) in spending, tax relief
and special loan programs to boost growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
