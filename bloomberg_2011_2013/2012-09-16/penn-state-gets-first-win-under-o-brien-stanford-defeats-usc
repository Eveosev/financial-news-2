Pennsylvania State University  got
its first victory under Bill O’Brien with a 34-7 home win
yesterday over Navy, and  Stanford University  beat the  University
of Southern California  for the fourth straight season.  Alabama, the top-ranked team in the Associated Press
college football poll, cruised past Arkansas 52-0, while 20th-
ranked  Notre Dame  beat No. 10 Michigan State 20-3.  Matt McGloin threw four touchdown passes, completing 13 of
21 attempts for 231 yards without an interception as Penn State
(1-2) topped the Midshipmen (0-2) in Beaver Stadium in State
College, Pennsylvania.  The Nittany Lions’ last victory was over Ohio State on Nov.
19 last season, shortly after former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was charged with child abuse in a case that exposed an
alleged cover-up scandal, leading to the firing of 46-year head
coach  Joe Paterno . O’Brien became the team’s new coach in
January and the school was fined $60 million and stripped of 112
wins in July.  Allen Robinson caught three touchdown passes from McGloin -
- from 45 yards, 2 yards and 25 yards -- finishing with five
receptions for 136 yards for the game.  Navy’s Gee Gee Greene was the leading rusher with 70 yards
on eight carries, scoring his team’s only points on a 12-yard
fourth-quarter run.  Second-ranked USC fell to the No. 21 Cardinal for the
fourth straight time, getting outscored 14-0 in the second half
to fall 21-14 at Stanford Stadium in Stanford,  California .  First-Quarter Score  Cardinal running back Stepfan Taylor rushed for 156 yards,
including a 59-yard first-quarter score, and caught a 23-yard
touchdown toss from Josh Nunes. Nunes was 14-of-31 passing for
215 yards with two scoring passes and two interceptions as
Stanford raised its record to 3-0.  Silas Redd, who transfered from  Penn State  before the
season, rushed for both of the Trojans’ touchdowns, though he
was kept to 17 yards on 13 carries. Senior quarterback Matt
Barkley completed 20 of his 41 pass attempts for 253 yards. He
was intercepted twice as USC fell to 2-1.  Alabama forced five Arkansas turnovers to win the matchup
in both teams’ first  Southeastern Conference  game this season.  Eddy Lacy had three touchdown runs for the Crimson Tide
(3-0), who recorded their second straight shutout. Playing
without injured quarterback Tyler Wilson, the Razorbacks fell to
1-2.  John Goodman  caught a 36-yard touchdown pass from Everett
Golson, who also rushed for a six-yard score as the Notre Dame
Fighting Irish (3-0) beat Michigan State (2-1) in East Lansing,
Michigan.  No. 3 LSU beat Idaho 63-14; fourth-ranked Oregon beat
Tennessee Tech 63-14; No. 5 Florida State shut out Wake Forest
52-0; eighth-ranked South Carolina topped Alabama at Birmingham
49-6; No. 9 West Virginia beat James Madison 42-12; 11th-ranked
Clemson topped Furman 41-7; No. 12 Ohio State beat California
35-28; and No. 13 Virginia Tech was upset by Pittsburgh 35-17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
