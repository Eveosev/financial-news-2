French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said a plan to tax those who earn more than 1 million
euros ($1.3 million) a year at a rate of 75 percent will remain
in place for two years.  “We aren’t watering down the measure,” he said in an
interview on RTL radio. “It’s a strong, patriotic measure.
Those that got very rich over the past period can help in a
patriotic way to turn around the country.”  The government will also include a new marginal tax rate of
45 percent in the 2013 budget to be presented to the Cabinet
Sept. 28, Moscovici said.  The government has said the tax on high earners is part of
a bid to turn around an economy that hasn’t grown in three
quarters and lower the deficit. President  Francois Hollande  is
also struggling with joblessness at a 13-year high and a budget
hole of more than 30 billion euros for next year.  “An economy that is indebted is a sick economy,”
Moscovici said today. “Lowering the debt is a necessary battle
to have our sovereignty from the markets. I don’t want  France  to
be a prisoner of its debt.”  Financing of social security will be overhauled to “make
it sustainable,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
