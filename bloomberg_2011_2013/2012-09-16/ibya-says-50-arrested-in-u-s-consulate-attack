The president of  Libya ’s General
National Congress said about 50 arrests have been made in
connection with the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi
that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three
others.  Mohammed Yussef Magariaf said on CBS’s “Face the Nation”
program the attack was “planned by foreigners, by people who
entered the country a few months ago,” from countries including
Mali and Algeria. The Sept. 11 date of the attack “leaves us in
no doubt that this was preplanned,” he said, according to a
transcript of the interview.  Magariaf also said the  Federal Bureau of Investigation 
should stay out of Libya “for a little while.”  “We do what we have to do ourselves,” he said on CBS.
“Any hasty action, I think, is not welcome.”  He said the attack against the consulate and the killings
of Americans were “ugly deeds” that “do not resemble any way,
in any sense, the aspirations, the feelings of Libyans towards
the  United States  and its citizens.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
