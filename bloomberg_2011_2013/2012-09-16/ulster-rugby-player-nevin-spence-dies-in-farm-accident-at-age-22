Ulster rugby player Nevin Spence
was killed yesterday in an accident on the family’s farm
alongside his brother and father. He was 22.  “This is a very sad day for rugby, Nevin was a  rising star 
for his province and his country,” David Jordan, tournament
director of the Pro12 league,  said in a statement  on the
league’s website. “He will leave a lasting legacy with the
rugby community in Ireland.”  The British Broadcasting Corp.  said on its website  that
initial reports suggested Spence’s father Noel fell into a
slurry tank and that Nevin and his brother Graham died while
trying to rescue him. Nevin’s sister Emma is being treated in
the hospital after the incident near Hillsborough,  Northern
Ireland , the  BBC  said.  Spence, who played at centre, made his debut for Ulster
against the Ospreys in April 2010 and played 42 times for the
team. His was named as Young Player of the Year at the Irish
Rugby Football Union Players’ Association Awards last year.  “Nevin was a wonderful player but also a wonderful
person,” Shane Logan, chief executive officer of Ulster Rugby,
said on the team’s  website . “He was well liked by everyone who
knew him and his loss will be deeply felt by his teammates and
everyone at Ulster Rugby.”  Spence’s last game for Ulster was for its second-string
Ravens team on Sept. 14 against Munster A.  To contact the reporter on this story:
