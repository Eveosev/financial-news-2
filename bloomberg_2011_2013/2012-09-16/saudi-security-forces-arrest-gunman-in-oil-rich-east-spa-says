Saudi security forces arrested
three men in the al-Qatif area in the country’s  Eastern
Province , including one wanted for an attack on a police patrol
last month, the official  Saudi Press Agency  said, citing an
unidentified  Interior Ministry  spokesman.  Hussain al-Muslim was detained at a house yesterday where
he was hiding from police, the news service said, citing the
Interior Ministry statement. He was accused of being involved in
a shooting in August that killed First Class Private Hosein Ali
Zabani and wounded First Class Private Saad Miteb Mohammad Al
Shammari, it said.  Gunmen on motorcycles attacked the officers’ patrol in the
al-Qatif area, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Aug. 4.
Security forces exchanged gunfire with the armed men and
arrested four attackers, one of whom died while being taken to a
hospital, the news service said last month, citing the Interior
Ministry.  While Sunni-majority  Saudi Arabia  largely avoided the
unrest that spread across the Arab world last year, minority
Shiite protesters have clashed with security forces in the
village of Awwamiya, al-Qatif, and other eastern towns. In July,
security forces arrested dissident Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr in
the al-Qatif area.  Hassan al-Darweesh and Hassan al-Mubaireek, who were also
wanted by the police, were taken into custody yesterday, the
news service said. None of the police personnel were injured
during the raid, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
