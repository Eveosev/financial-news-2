Abu Dhabi  government employees will
be required to live inside the United Arab Emirates capital
within a year, the official  WAM  news agency reported, citing the
emirateâ€™s Secretariat General of the Executive Council.  The decision was made to ensure the safety of employees
commuting long distances, often in bad weather conditions, the
council said, according to WAM. As many as 19,564 people drive
into Abu Dhabi in the morning hours, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
