Iran is grappling with drought and
the country’s enemies are worsening it by destroying the
nation’s rain clouds, Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
said.  “Part of the drought is unintentional and due to  climate
change  and part of it intentional and due to a war started by
the enemy, which is emptying clouds before they reach our
country,” Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying in a report
published today by the state-run  Mehr  news agency.  “This is another war that Iran will overcome,”
Ahmadinejad said, without elaborating. Iranian officials refer
to the U.S. and Israel as enemies that seek to undermine the
Islamic Republic through economic, cyber and psychological
warfare.  Iran is at loggerheads with the U.S. and its allies over
its nuclear program and has come under a series of financial,
trade and energy sanctions for its refusal to curb its
activities.  Iran  says as a signatory to the nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty it is entitled to carry out work as part of
its civilian nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
