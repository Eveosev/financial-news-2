Spain took an unbeatable 3-1 lead
against the U.S. in tennis’s Davis Cup to reach the final for a
fourth time in five years.  David Ferrer beat  John Isner  6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 on
clay in the decisive match in Gijon, Spain. Nicolas Almagro is
scheduled to play  Sam Querrey  in today’s other match.  Defending champion Spain has won the title five times in

trophy since the U.S. had the last of its record 32 titles in
2007.  The Czech Republic leads Argentina 2-1 in the other
