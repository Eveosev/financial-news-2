At least eight Afghan women were
killed today by a NATO airstrike as they gathered firewood in
the mountains of  Afghanistan ’s eastern Laghman province, NATO
and government officials said.  President  Hamid Karzai  condemned the killing of eight
civilians and wounding of seven others and ordered an
investigation team to probe the incident, his press office said
in an e-mailed statement.  NATO’s International Security Assistance Forces, or ISAF,
confirmed the airstrike, which occurred in the middle of last
night, and said both insurgents and civilians were involved.  “A large number of insurgents were killed in the
engagement,” Capt. Dan Einert, an ISAF spokesman, said in a
telephone interview from Kabul. “Unfortunately we are aware of
possible civilian casualties.”  ISAF’s initial reports indicates “five to eight
civilians,” have been killed, Einert said.  The airstrike was in the Alingar district of the province
just before dawn early today, according to a statement from the
provincial governor’s office.  Some of the dead were brought today to the provincial
governor’s office by family members. “They asked for justice
from the governor while shouting ‘death to America’,” Sarhadi
Zewak, the provincial governor’s spokesman, said in a phone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
