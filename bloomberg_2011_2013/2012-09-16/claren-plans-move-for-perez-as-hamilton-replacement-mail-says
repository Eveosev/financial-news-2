Sauber’s Sergio Perez is a target
for the McLaren Formula One team as it plans for the possible
departure of  Lewis Hamilton , the Mail on Sunday reported.  Contact has been made with Perez, a 22-year-old Mexican,
while Hamilton considers an offer worth as much as 60 million
pounds ($97.3 million) over three years to join Mercedes from
next season, the  newspaper said , without citing anyone.  Hamilton, 27, who has won two of the past three races, is
also being offered a new contract by McLaren worth 45 million
pounds to the Briton over two years, with the option of a
further year, the Mail said.  Perez has secured three podium finishes this season, his
second year in the sport, including as runnerup to Hamilton at
last weekend’s Italian Grand Prix at Monza. McLaren has turned
to the Mexican as it becomes frustrated with the negotiating
strategy of Hamilton’s management, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
