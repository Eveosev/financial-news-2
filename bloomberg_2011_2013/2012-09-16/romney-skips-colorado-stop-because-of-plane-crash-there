Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign
will skip a planned stop today in Pueblo, Colorado, because of a
small-plane crash at the airport where the event was planned.  “Due to a plane crash involving a small aircraft at the
Pueblo airport that is under investigation we are no longer
going to Pueblo,” Romney’s traveling press secretary  Rick Gorka 
said in a statement to reporters. “We do not want to interfere
with the investigation or any emergency response efforts.”  -- Editors: Ann Hughey, Laurie Asseo  To contact the reporter on this story:
