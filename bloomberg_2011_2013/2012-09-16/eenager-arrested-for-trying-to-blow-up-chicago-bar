An 18-year-old man was arrested by
the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  for allegedly trying to blow
up a downtown Chicago bar with a car bomb.  Adel Dould, a U.S. citizen from Hillside,  Illinois , was
taken into custody yesterday after an undercover operation by
federal officials, the FBI said in a statement. Dould was
charged yesterday in a criminal complaint in federal court with
two counts, including attempting to use a weapon of mass
destruction, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison,
according to the FBI.  The FBI has been monitoring Dould, who began posting
violent materials relating to jihad and the killing of Americans
on the Internet last year, according to the statement.  The explosives Dould tried to obtain were supplied by
undercover agents and posed no actual threat, the FBI said in
the statement.  In April, a Chicago man pleaded guilty to charges that he
tried in 2010 to detonate a bomb he had stashed in a trash can
near the cityâ€™s historic baseball stadium, Wrigley Field. Sami
Samir Hassoun admitted to attempted use of a weapon of mass
destruction and trying to use an explosive to damage or destroy
a building used in interstate commerce. The bomb was a fake that
had been provided to Hassoun in a government sting operation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
