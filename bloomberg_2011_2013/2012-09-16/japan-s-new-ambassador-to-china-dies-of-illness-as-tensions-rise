Japan’s new ambassador to  China 
died this morning following an unspecified illness, the Foreign
Ministry said today, five days after his appointment amid an
intensifying territorial dispute between the two countries.  Incoming envoy Shinichi Nishimiya, 60, was hospitalized on
Sept. 13, the ministry said at the time. Nishimiya collapsed and
lost consciousness near his Tokyo home,  Kyodo News  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Tensions between Asia’s two largest economies have risen
over rights to uninhabited islands in the  East China Sea  known
as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. The Japanese
government nationalized the islands last week and China
dispatched six government vessels to nearby waters.  Japan announced on Sept. 11 that Nishimiya would replace
Uichiro Niwa, the first private-sector appointee to become
ambassador to China. Niwa’s car was blocked and the Japanese
flag attached to it ripped off by assailants in Beijing last
month.  Japan’s foreign minister and defense chief returned to
Tokyo yesterday, cutting short a visit to Australia as anti-
Japanese protests flared up across China. In Beijing, more than
1,000 people gathered outside the Japanese embassy yesterday,
with some throwing eggs and plastic bottles outside,  Radio
Television Hong Kong  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
