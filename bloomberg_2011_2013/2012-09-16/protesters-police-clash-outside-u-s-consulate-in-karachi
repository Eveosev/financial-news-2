Protesters and police clashed
outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi,  Pakistan , as a religious
group staged a rally against an anti-Islamic video that has
triggered demonstrations across the Muslim world.  Police used water cannons and fired in the air to disperse
the protesters who broke through barriers and reached the
consulate building. Alberto Rodriguez, spokesman for the U.S.
embassy in Islamabad did not immediately answer calls to his
mobile phone.  One protester was killed and four were injured in the
clases, GEO television reported.  Pakistan blocked websites on Sept. 13 showing excerpts of
the American-made short video, and the National Assembly, or the
lower house of parliament, passed a resolution demanding the
images, portraying the  Prophet Muhammad  as a womanizer, be
removed from the Internet.  Spreading protests in the  Middle East  follow the killing of
the American ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three
colleagues during an attack on consular buildings in Benghazi on
Sept. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
