U.S. equity futures were little
changed after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index finished last week
at the highest level since 2007. Oil advanced and the euro
weakened.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less
than 0.1 percent to 1,458.20 at 7:19 a.m. in Tokyo. The U.S.
equity benchmark rallied 1.9 percent last week. Oil increased
0.2 percent to $99.19 a barrel in  New York . The euro lost 0.1
percent to $1.3118.  New home construction and sales of previously owned houses
probably climbed in August, economists said before reports this
week. Housing starts increased to a 765,000 annual rate, the
fastest in almost four years, from a 746,000 pace in July,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The  S&P 500  is 6.8 percent away from its all-time high set
in October 2007. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 2.2
percent to 13,593.37 last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
