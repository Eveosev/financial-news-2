An Israeli military offensive
against Iran would be “unacceptable,” United Nations
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, expressing concern over the
“fierce rhetoric” on the issue, Agence France-Presse reported.  “An attack against a country is unacceptable and the idea
of a counter attack isn’t acceptable either,” Ban was quoted as
saying in an interview with the French program
“Internationales” to be aired today, AFP said.  Ban said he is “highly concerned by the political rhetoric
over a possible military attack or a retaliation” and urged a
return to dialog to resolve the conflict around  Iran’s nuclear
program , the  news agency  said.  The main issue is Iranians’ refusal to allow  International
Atomic Energy Agency  inspectors to access sites inside the
country, he said, calling for Iranian officials to “fully
cooperate” with the UN’s nuclear watchdog, according to the
report published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
