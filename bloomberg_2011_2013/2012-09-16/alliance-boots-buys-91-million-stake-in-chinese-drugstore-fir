Alliance Boots GmbH, the largest
U.K. drugstore chain, will buy a 12 percent stake in  China ’s
 Nanjing Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. (600713)  for about 56 million pounds
($91 million), it said in a statement today.  Alliance Boots will become the second-largest shareholder
as part of a strategic alliance between the two companies.
Nanjing Pharmaceutical Company is the fifth-biggest drugs
wholesaler in China with sales of 2 billion pounds last year,
Boots said in the announcement.  The deal will allow the Nanjing, China-based company to
“improve its management practices, achieve greater performance,
and help China’s medical industry reach global standards,” said
its chairman, Zhou Yaoping.  Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the biggest U.S. drugstore operator, said in
June it agreed to buy 45 percent of Alliance Boots from owners
including private-equity firm KKR & Co. and Alliance Boots
Chairman Stefano Pessina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
