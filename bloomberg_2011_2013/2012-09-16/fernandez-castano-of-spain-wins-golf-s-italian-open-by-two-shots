Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano scored a
final-round 64, 8-under par, to win golf’s Italian Open by two
shots today.  The Spaniard finished on 264, 24-under par, for his second
victory in the tournament and sixth on the European Tour. Garth
Mulroy of  South Africa  was second, and Gregory Bourdy of France
and Italy’s Matteo Manassero were a further two shots back in
Turin.  England’s Gary Boyd scored a 3-under par “albatross” at
the par-5 eighth, holing a six-iron from 226 yards. He finished
joint fifth on 18-under.  The winner picked up a prize of 250,000 euros ($328,000).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
