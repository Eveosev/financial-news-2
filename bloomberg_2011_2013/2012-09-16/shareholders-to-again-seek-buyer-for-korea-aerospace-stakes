Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. (047810) 
shareholders will again seek potential buyers for their 1
trillion won ($895 million) holdings in  South Korea ’s only
aircraft maker, nearly a month after an initial sale attempt
failed.  The second round of preliminary bidding will start tomorrow
and end Sept. 27, Korea Finance Corp., said today in an e-mailed
statement. The first round failed on Aug. 31 after only  Korean
Air Lines Co. (003490)  registered. Rules governing sales by government
entities require at least two bids.  South Korean lawmakers have expressed concerns about the
sale’s transparency ahead of the December presidential election.
Some have accused Korea Finance of moving hastily to place the
company under private control, which would weaken public
oversight.  The pool of potential bidders for Sacheon-based Korea
Aerospace, which has a market value of $2.2 billion according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg, is limited by national-security
rules mandating that it remain under domestic ownership. South
Korea’s military accounted for 57 percent of the company’s 1.29
trillion won of sales last year.  Korea Finance is offering part of its 26 percent stake in
Korea Aerospace in the sale. It plans to remain the second-
biggest shareholder.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  Samsung Techwin Co. (012450)  and
Doosan Group are each selling 10 percent holdings.  Korea Aerospace plans to spend 245.4 billion won this year,
including construction of a new plant that will make wing
components for Airbus SAS A320 planes under a record $1.2
billion deal signed in March.  The company, which also supplies  Boeing Co. (BA) , said in
February total orders this year may more than double to 5.45
trillion won. Second-quarter net income increased 27 percent to
44.1 billion won and sales rose 6.6 percent to 395.5 billion
won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
