Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai yesterday wed Elizabeth Macheka in a traditional
ceremony after a church ceremony was halted by a court, state-
controlled  Herald  reported, citing Tsvangirai.  The traditional wedding, under what is known as customary
law in  Zimbabwe , was held as a court barred a religious wedding
after two women filed law suits saying Tsvangirai was either
married or engaged, the Harare-based newspaper reported.  Zimbabwe law has no jurisdiction over customary marriages,
which are agreed between families.  To contact the reporter on this story:
