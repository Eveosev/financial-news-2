Tunisian authorities have arrested
75 people in connection with protests and an attack on the U.S.
embassy in the country’s capital, Khaled Tarouch, the spokesman
for the  Interior Ministry , said by phone today.  “Arrests are still continuing and will include all persons
with connections to the embassy attack,” Tarouch said.  Several thousand Salafis, who adhere to a conservative
interpretation of Islam, had demonstrated by the embassy on
Sept. 14 against a film deemed offensive to Muslims.
Demonstrators attacked the embassy, climbing over its walls and
burning vehicles, as well as torching the nearby American
school.  To contact the reporter on this story:
