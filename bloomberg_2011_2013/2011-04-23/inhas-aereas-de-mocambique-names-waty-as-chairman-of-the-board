Mozambique’s national airline,
 Linhas Aereas de Mocambique , said Teodoro Andre Waty has
replaced Jose Viegas as chairman of its board of directors.  The state-owned airline said in an e-mailed message that
Waty was appointed yesterday after a general assembly in which
all board members were replaced.  LAM said the board changes aren’t related to the
blacklisting of the company’s planes in the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
