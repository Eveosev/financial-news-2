Major League Baseball  is working
toward expanding its postseason by two teams in 2012,
Commissioner Bud Selig told the  Associated Press .  The American and National leagues would each add a second
wild-card team, increasing the playoff field to 10 teams total.
The wild-card teams in each league would meet, with the winners
meeting one of the three division winners.  “I would say we’re moving to expanding the playoffs, but
there’s a myriad of details to work out,” Selig told the AP two
days ago. “Ten is a fair number.”  Because an extra round would push the postseason deeper
into cold weather, the wild-card round is likely to be a best-
of-three or a one-game winner-take-all instead of the current
best-of-seven format or a best-of-five, AP said.  Baseball last expanded the playoffs in 1995, when it
doubled the field from four teams to eight. In the  National
Football League , 12 of 32 teams make the playoffs, while the
National Basketball Association and National Hockey League have
16 of 30 teams in the postseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
