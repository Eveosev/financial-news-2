The European Union’s  Common
Agricultural Policy  needs “profound reform” in order to allow
the bloc’s farmers to take advantage of the rise in food demand
worldwide, Polish Agriculture Minister Marek Sawicki said.  “At least half” of the EU’s farming budget should be
earmarked for modernization projects to make farms in the 27-
member bloc more competitive, Sawicki said in an interview in
the Gazeta Wyborcza daily newspaper today.  If the world does not suffer any natural disasters in 2011,
food prices may decline by the end of this year, Sawicki said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
