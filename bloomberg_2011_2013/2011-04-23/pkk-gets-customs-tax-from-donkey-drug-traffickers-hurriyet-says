The Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or
PKK, set up customs posts in the mountains near Turkey’s border
with  Iran  to collect taxes from smugglers bringing drugs such as
heroin by donkey or other means, Hurriyet said.  PKK members manning the posts collect $65 for each kilo of
processed drugs and $25 for each kilo of base morphine, the
newspaper reported citing documents prepared by prosecutors in
Turkey’s Van region, the newspaper reported.  Smugglers are charged $7 per donkey transporting cigarettes
and $3 per donkey carrying fuel, Hurriyet said. More than 55
metric tons of drugs pass through the four so-called customs
points annually, it said.      The group, also known as the PKK, has fought a two-decade
war of autonomy for Kurds in southeast  Turkey  at the cost of
almost 40,000 lives, most of them Kurdish. The militants are
labeled terrorists by the U.S. and the European Union.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
