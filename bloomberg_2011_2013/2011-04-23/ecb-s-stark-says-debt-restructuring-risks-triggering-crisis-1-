European Central Bank Chief
Economist  Juergen Stark  said a debt restructuring by a euro
country risked triggering a banking crisis that could “worst
case” exceed the effects of the failure of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., according to the transcript of an interview
posted by German television station ZDF on its  website .  There is “no painless way” for countries that sought aid
to reduce debt, while a restructuring may cut off the respective
country from the financial markets for an unforeseeable time,
Stark was quoted as saying.  The only viable path for such countries is to “strictly
push through reform programs and repay debt in full,” the
central banker was quoted as saying. Stark did not refer to a
specific country.  The interview did not contain commentary on interest rates
or inflation.  A call to the ECB press office in  Frankfurt  during non-
business hours seeking confirmation of the comments wasn’t
answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
