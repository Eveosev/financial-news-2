Shanghai  cut fees it collects from
container-truck drivers to encourage them to resume work
following a strike in  China ’s busiest port city, the official
Xinhua  News Agency  reported.  The city administration also abolished non-standard levies,
the news agency reported citing an unidentified government
spokesman. All ports in Shanghai were operating normally,
according to the report.  Truck drivers blocked a dockyard on April 20 and smashed
the windows of trucks whose drivers refused to take part in the
demonstration, the  Associated Press  reported. Protests in the
city come as the government of the world’s second-largest
economy tries to cool inflation which accelerated last month to
the fastest pace since July 2008.  Calls made to Shanghai government’s press office weren’t
answered today.  Shanghai truck drivers complained warehouse operators
introduced a new charge of 50 yuan ($7.7) in October for trucks
that pick up more than one container, AP said, citing driver
Zhao Feng. Truckers blockaded a dock in Pudong district in
eastern Shanghai on April 21, the report said, citing a
logistics company employee.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
