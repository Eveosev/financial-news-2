Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
may soon announce a plan to ease the shortage of trained workers
in the country,  O Globo  reported, citing a government source
familiar with the plan that it did not identify.  The goal is to train 3.5 million workers by 2014, with a
focus on construction, information technology and service
industries, the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper said.  The plan includes offering student loans at lower rates,
according to  O Globo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
