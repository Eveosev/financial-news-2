finances are in almost as bad a state as those of  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal , the London-based  Times  reported.  An economists’ report from the bank gauging the sovereign
risk of 14 advanced economies ranked the U.S. directly behind
the three European nations, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
