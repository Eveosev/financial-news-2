The Polish central bank should
raise  interest rates  as early as next month after  core inflation 
jumped to a 12-month high in March, according to Dariusz Filar,
a member of the government’s Council of Economic Advisors.  Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel
prices from the  consumer price index , accelerated to an annual 2
percent in March.  “This level is a little too high and must be brought
down,” Filar, a former member of the central bank’s rate-
setting Monetary Policy Council, wrote in an article published
today in Gazeta Wyborcza. Part of the central bank’s strategy
should “incline it to raise the reference rate by 25 basis
points at the council’s May meeting,” from 4 percent currently,
he wrote.  Policy makers across the globe are struggling to curb
inflation, propelled by soaring food and fuel prices amid unrest
in the oil-rich countries of Northern Africa and the Middle
East. The Polish central bank lifted its benchmark rate this
month for the second time this year, while the  European Central
Bank  has started increasing borrowing costs for the first time
in almost three years.  Poland’s rate setters should then wait until July when
they’ll have the next inflation projections before considering a
further rate increase, Filar said in the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
