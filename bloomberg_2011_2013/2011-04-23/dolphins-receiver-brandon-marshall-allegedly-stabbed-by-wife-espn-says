Miami Dolphins receiver Brandon Marshall underwent surgery last night after allegedly being
stabbed by his wife with a kitchen knife, ESPN reported on its
website, citing National Football League sources it didn’t
identify.  Marshall’s wife, Michi Nogami-Marshall, 26, was arrested in
Miami on a domestic-violence charge of aggravated battery with a
deadly weapon, according to an  arrest listing  on the website of
the Broward County Sheriff’s Office, which provided no specific
details on the incident. Bond was set at $7,500.  Marshall, 27, was taken to Broward General Hospital and had
surgery for a stab wound to the stomach,  ESPN said . No vital
organs were pierced and doctors told him he will be fine in two
to three weeks, ESPN said.  “We are aware of the reports and our thoughts are with
Brandon at this time,” Dolphins spokesman Harvey Greene said in
a  statement  on the team’s website. “We will look into the
matter, but because we are not allowed to have any contact with
any of our players, we will refrain from making any further
comment.”  NFL owners declared a labor lockout on March 12 after
failing to reach a collective bargaining agreement with the
players, preventing both sides from having any contact.  Miami acquired Marshall, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, in
a trade with the  Denver Broncos  in April 2010 for a pair of
second-round draft picks. He led the Dolphins with 86 catches
and 1,014 yards last season, while scoring three touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
