Tokyo Electric Power Co. will use
temporary  storage tanks , with a combined capacity of 31,400
metric tons, to store radioactive water at its crippled
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant by early June, general
manager Junichi Matsumoto said at a briefing today.  The company has ordered the addition of 20,000-cubic-meter
tanks at the atomic station every month starting June, he said,
