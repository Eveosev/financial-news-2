Ireland was forced by the  European
Central Bank  into seeking an international bailout in November,
the Irish Times cited  Brian Lenihan , then finance minister, as
saying in an  interview .  Lenihan said that it was “damaging” and a “betrayal”
how some ECB governing council members briefed some media about
Ireland, the paper said in a report published today.  Ajai Chopra, deputy director for Europe at the
International Monetary Fund, said external authorities were
“trying to avoid a situation where you had a fully fledged bank
run” as the IMF and European Union shaped the aid package, the
Irish Times cites Chopra as saying in an  interview .  To contact the reporter on this story:
