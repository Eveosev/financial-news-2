Queens Park Rangers rallied to draw
2-2 at Cardiff and move a step closer to promotion to English
soccer’s Premier League.  Adel Taarabt’s second goal of the game in the 71st minute
to give QPR the tie. Rangers lead the second-tier Championship
with 84 points, seven more than Norwich and eight ahead of
Cardiff, with three matches remaining.  A win today would have guaranteed QPR of a top-two finish,
earning it automatic promotion to the Premier League. It can now
claim a place by beating Hull at home in two days.  QPR does face a disciplinary hearing next month for rule
breaches linked to the signing of midfielder Alejandro Faurlin
in 2009. Possible sanctions include a points deduction and a
decision is due May 6, the eve of the final regular season game
against Leeds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
