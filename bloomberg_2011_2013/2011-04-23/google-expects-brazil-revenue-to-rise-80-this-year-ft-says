Google Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s biggest
Internet-search company, expects revenue from its Brazil
business to rise 80 percent this year because of government
investment, the Financial Times reported, citing Fabio Coelho,
head of the company’s Brazilian subsidiary.  The company said March 1 it’s opening new offices in Latin
America and boosting staffing levels by 50 percent to capitalize
on its fastest-growing region. Revenue from Latin America surged
80 percent last year, outpacing every other market, Vice
President Dennis Woodside said in an interview at the time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
