The  Tampa Bay  Lightning beat the
Pittsburgh Penguins 8-2 to avoid elimination from the first
round of the National Hockey League playoffs.  Simon Gagne, Steven Stamkos and Pavel Kubina scored two
goals each in Pittsburgh as the Lightning pulled within 3-2 in
the best-of-seven Eastern Conference series. Vincent Lecavalier
and Dominic Moore also scored for Tampa Bay, which hosts Game 6
in two days.  The Washington Capitals can eliminate the  New York Rangers 
and the San Jose Sharks can knock out the Los Angeles Kings with
home-ice wins later today. The Montreal Canadiens also visit the
Boston Bruins with that series tied 2-2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
