The  Boston Celtics  defeated the  New
York  Knicks 113-96 to come within one game of a sweep in round
one of the National Basketball Association playoffs.  The  Atlanta Hawks  beat the Orlando Magic 88-84 to lead two
games to one, while the  Los Angeles Lakers  topped the New
Orleans Hornets 100-86 for a 2-1 edge in their best-of-seven
series.  The Celtics’ victory last night at New York’s Madison
Square Garden gave Boston a 3-0 advantage in their Eastern
Conference series. Host New York will attempt to prevent
elimination in Game 4 tomorrow.  The Celtics started the game by taking a 9-0 lead over the
Knicks.  “You can’t give them that big an opening that they can
smell blood,” Knicks coach  Mike D’Antoni  told reporters.  Boston had a 52-44 lead at the half and then came back with
a 19-6 run early in the third quarter.  Paul Pierce had 38 points and  Ray Allen  added 32, while
Rajon Rondo had a triple-double with 15 points, 11 rebounds and
20 assists for the Celtics.  Shaquille O’Neal  remained sidelined by a strained right calf,
although he did travel with the team to New York. He said there
was a possibility he would be ready for the next game.  Shawne Williams led the Knicks with 17 points and Carmelo Anthony and Toney Douglas each had 15 points. Knicks’ forward
Amar’e Stoudemire, who sat out Game 2 with back spasms, was held
to seven points.  “I felt good enough to play but I wasn’t 100 percent,”
said Stoudemire, who was 2 for 8. “I just wanted to show some
courage out there for the fans of New York.”  Chauncey Billups , who has missed two games with a strained
knee, said his return to the Knicks for round one is uncertain.  “It’s just tough, man. This is the time of the season that
I live for,” Billups told reporters before last night’s game.
“But I’m just going to continue trying to do the best that I
can do to get back on the floor, man, but simply, it’s just not
ready.”  At Philips Arena in Atlanta, Al Horford hit a 22-foot jump
shot with 46 seconds left to give the Hawks an 85-84 lead, and
Jamal Crawford put the win out of reach of the Magic with a 26-
foot 3-pointer with five seconds left.  Crawford led the Hawks with 23 points and Joe Johnson added
21. Dwight Howard had 21 points and 15 rebounds for the Magic,
who play Game 4 tomorrow in Atlanta.  At New Orleans Arena,  Kobe Bryant  had 30 points and Pau Gasol had 17 for the Lakers. Carl Landry led with 23 points
followed by Chris Paul with 22 for the Hornets, who host Game 4
tomorrow.  In today’s games, the  Chicago Bulls  will attempt to
eliminate the  Indiana Pacers  with a 4-0 sweep; the Dallas
Mavericks will try to gain a 3-1 lead over the Portland Trail
Blazers; either the San Antonio Spurs or Memphis Grizzles will
break their 1-1 series tie; and the Denver Nuggets will try for
their first win in Game 3 against the Oklahoma City Thunder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
