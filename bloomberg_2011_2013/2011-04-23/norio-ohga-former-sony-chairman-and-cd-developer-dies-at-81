Norio Ohga, the former  Sony Corp. (6758) 
chairman credited with introducing the world to the compact disc,
died, the company said. He was 81.  Ohga died of multiple organ failure on April 23 at 9:14 a.m.
in Tokyo, the company said in a statement. He stepped down as
chairman of the board at the consumer-electronics maker in
January 2003 after his health declined following a stroke.  Experience as a vocalist in college fueled Ohga’s interest
in compact disc technology. He pushed for a format that allowed
75 minutes of uninterrupted playing time, Sony said,
establishing a CD format still in use today. Sony sold the
world’s first CD in 1982. Ohga also was instrumental in the
development of  PlayStation  in 1994, having approved plans for
the video-game console in 1992.  “By redefining Sony as a company encompassing both
hardware and software, Ohga-san succeeded where other Japanese
companies failed,” Howard Stringer, Sony’s chief executive
officer, said in a statement.  He also expanded the company’s portfolio, putting Sony in
both the record and motion-picture businesses. In 1968, Sony
said he led negotiations for the purchase of Sony Music
Entertainment Inc. In 1989, with Ohga in charge, Sony acquired
 Columbia Pictures .  Love of Music  Ohga was a student at Tokyo University of the Arts in the
1950s when he met Sony founders Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita. He
was made an adviser to  Tokyo  Telecommunications Engineering
Corp., now Sony, helping test audio equipment. He joined the
company full-time in 1959.  He served as president from September 1982 to April 1995,
and as company chairman until 2000.  In November 2001, he suffered a stroke while conducting the
Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra at the Beijing International Music
Festival.  Ohga maintained his lifelong interest in music. In 2003, he
donated his 1.6 billion yen ($20 million) retirement pay to
build a  concert hall in Karuizawa , in the Japanese prefecture of
Nagano.  He also conducted the Boston, Pittsburgh and Vienna
symphony orchestras, and was the biggest donor to the Seiji
Ozawa music hall in Tanglewood,  Massachusetts , which opened in
1994.  Sony said a private wake will be held, with a company
service taking place at a later date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
