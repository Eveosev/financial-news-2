Saudi Arabian shares rose to the
highest in a week after petrochemical companies reported better-
than-estimated earnings and oil jumped.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemicals maker, rose to the highest since September 2008,
while  National Industrialization Co. (NIC)  climbed to a three-year
high. Rabigh Refining and Petrochemicals Co. surged by the
maximum allowed in a single trading session.  The 146-company  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  advanced 0.2
percent to 6,590.64 at the 3:30 p.m. close in  Riyadh , the
gauge’s highest level since April 16. Crude oil for June
delivery rose for a third day to $112.29 a barrel on April 21
before the Easter vacation halted trading, taking its gain this
year to 23 percent. Sabic said this week that first-quarter
profit surged 42 percent, while Rabigh’s net income more than
doubled.  “The market is poised for further upside with excellent
first-quarter results out of the petrochemicals and some of the
midcaps, coupled with positive signs of sustained global
economic recovery,” said Fuad Aghabi, investment director at
 Ajeej Capital  in Riyadh.  Sabic advanced 0.7 percent to 112.50 riyals ($30) before a
shareholder meeting later today that may approve a 2-riyals-per-
share dividend for the second half of 2010. Saudi Arabia holds
one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves.  “Oil’s stellar performance over the Saudi weekend is
keeping petrochemicals well bid despite some limited stock-
specific profit-taking,” said Amro Halwani, a senior trader at
Shuaa Capital PSC in Riyadh. “Investors are particularly
optimistic on Sabic and expect its shareholders meeting to
confirm a healthy dividend.”  Rabigh gained 9.7 percent to 26.6 riyals, the highest since
July 20. National Industrialization climbed 3.8 percent to 38.3
riyals, the highest since April 2008.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
