 Horst Seehofer, head of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition partner CSU, said the
country could exit nuclear energy “by and large” by 2020,
 Spiegel  magazine said, citing an interview with the politician.  Seehofer wants to push for a toll on Autobahn highways,
which could be about 100 euros ($146) a year and wants to ensure
foreign drivers using German roads also help pay for maintaining
them, the magazine cites Seehofer as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
