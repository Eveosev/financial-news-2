Manchester City  officials are
worried that captain  Carlos Tevez  will look to leave after the
season, the Daily Mail said.  Tevez, currently in Italy receiving treatement for a
hamstring injury, has been linked with Inter Milan and Juventus,
the Mail said. The Argentine is staying in the same hotel in
Milan as the Inter team, fuelling media speculation a deal could
be in the making, the newspaper said.  Tevez, who has three years left on his contract, has
differences with manager Roberto Mancini and is also tired of
living in England after six years, the Mail said. He asked for a
move earlier this season, only to change his mind, the newspaper
said.  Mancini is hoping Tevez will be fit for the F.A. Cup final
against Stoke on May 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
