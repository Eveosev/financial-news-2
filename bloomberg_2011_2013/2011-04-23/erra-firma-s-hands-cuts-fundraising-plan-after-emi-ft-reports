Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.
has reduced its fundraising expectations after losing 1.75
billion pounds ($2.9 billion) from its failed acquisition of EMI
Group Ltd., the  Financial Times  reported, citing an interview
with Chairman  Guy Hands .  Hands said he agreed with investors’ demands that Terra
Firma should never again put more than 15 percent of its money
into a single deal, according to the report. Hands expects the
private-equity firm’s next fund will total $3 billion, which
would be “quite tough to raise,” the FT quoting him as saying.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  seized EMI, the record label of the Beatles
and  Pink Floyd , in February. The 114-year-old music company had
struggled to meet the terms of the loans used to finance its 4
billion-pound buyout by Terra Firma in August 2007, just before
the credit crisis struck.  To contact the reporter on this story:
