Chris Smith scored 15 points to
lead the seventh-seeded  University of Louisville  to a 50-44 win
over No. 4  University of Cincinnati  in the Big East men’s
basketball championship final.  Louisville will make its sixth straight appearance in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament which begins
March 13. The 64 teams will learn their rankings today as the
postseason schedule is released.  Kyle Kuric had 13 points for the Cardinals, who won their
second title since joining the conference in the 2005-2006
season. Louisville won its first championship in 2009.  “The problem with this game is, Cincinnati and Louisville
know each other too well,” Cardinals coach Rick Pitino told
reporters. “The coaches know each other, they’ve worked
together. So you can’t run one play without the coaches on the
other side yelling it out. So defense has to win it.”  Cashmere Wright had a game-high 16 points for the Bearcats
(24-10), who were making their first appearance in a
championship game.  The Cardinals (26-9) stopped the Bearcats with six minutes
left in the first half, allowing only two Cincinnati points to
take a 24-14 halftime advantage last night at Madison Square
Garden in  New York .  In the second half, Smith’s 3-pointer gave the Cardinals a
44-28 lead with just over eight minutes to play. The Bearcats
then went on a 16-4 run, with Wright contributing nine points,
to tighten the score to 48-44 with two minutes, 35 seconds left
in the game.  Peyton Siva, the tournament Most Valuable Player, had 10
points for Louisville. He averaged 15 points, seven rebounds,
six assists and three steals in the first three games of the Big
East tournament.  “Nobody really expected us to even get this far,” Siva
said. “It just feels good because a lot of people wrote us off.
Coach P had a lot of faith in me. I’m very thankful for that.
Everybody really showed a lot of heart today.”  The NCAA tournament begins with four teams playing in the
first round in Dayton,  Ohio . The contest ends with the final
four teams playing for the national championship on March 31 and
April 2 in  New Orleans .  To contact the reporter on this story:
