The German government missed its
budget-savings targets for 2011 by more than half,  Der Spiegel 
reported, citing calculations by the Cologne-based economic
institute IW.  Germany  saved just 4.7 billion euros ($6.2 billion) of the
11.2 billion euros planned in its so-called savings package, the
magazine said. Less than half of the 19.1 billion euros in
planned savings for 2012 has been realized,  Der Spiegel  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
