New York  Knicks guard J.R. Smith
was fined $25,000 for putting a photo of a scantily clad woman
on his Twitter Inc. account site during the team’s stay in
 Milwaukee , the  National Basketball Association  said.  Smith was fined “for posting inappropriate pictures on his
Twitter account,” said Stu Jackson, the league’s executive vice
president of Basketball Operations.  After the Knicks lost to the Milwaukee Bucks 119-114 on
March 9, Smith apologized for the photo of the partially naked
woman, saying “I didn’t know it would turn into a big deal.
Whenever it takes away from our team, I regret it. It wasn’t the
smartest move.”  Smith, who signed with the Knicks on Feb. 17, scored three
points in his first start for New York in the loss to the Bucks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
