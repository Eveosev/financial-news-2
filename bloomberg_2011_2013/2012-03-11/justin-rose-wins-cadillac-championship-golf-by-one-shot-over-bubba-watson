Justin Rose  beat Bubba Watson by
one shot to win golfâ€™s Cadillac Championship, his fourth title
on the U.S. PGA Tour.  Rose, a 31-year-old from  England , won the World Golf
Championships event with a four-round score of 16-under-par 272.
Watson missed a putt of about 12 feet (3.6 meters) on the last
green that would have forced a playoff at the TPC Blue Monster
course at the Doral Golf Resort and Spa in Miami today.  Rose shot a 2-under-par 70 in the final round, while Watson, who
led overnight with a three-shot advantage over Rose, had a 74.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
