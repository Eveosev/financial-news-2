Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO)  denied
a media report that it intends to merge  Brazil ’s biggest
retailer, Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar,
with the company’s other operations in  Latin America .  Folha de S. Paulo  reported earlier today that the Saint-
Etienne, France-based retailer will convert non-voting preferred
shares in Pao de Acucar into voting shares as a first step to
merging its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and
Uruguay into a single regional operation. Folha did not say
where it obtained the information.  FSB Comunicacoes, an external public relations firm working
for Casino in Brazil, said in an e-mailed statement that “at
this point” the company doesn’t have any plans to reorganize
its Latin American operations.  Casino expects Abilio Diniz, the chairman of Pao de Acucar,
to leave the company following the reorganization, and expects
he may sell his stake in the company, Folha reported.  Pao de Acucar abandoned in July 2011 a plan to combine
operations with the Brazilian unit of  Carrefour SA (CA)  after Casino,
which shares control of the retailer with Diniz, rejected the
offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
