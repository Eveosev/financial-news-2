Germany ’s banks are slowly
regaining their health, Elke Koenig, president of German
financial regulator Bafin, said in an interview with the
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung .  “They’re slowly becoming healthy, but the risk of
contagion remains high,” Koenig told the newspaper. Asked what
would happen if a foreign bank collapsed, she said her agency is
“optimistic that the German banks are prepared for nearly all
imaginable scenarios.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
