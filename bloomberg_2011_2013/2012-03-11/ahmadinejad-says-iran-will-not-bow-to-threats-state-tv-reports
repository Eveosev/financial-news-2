Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said the citizens of the Shiite Islamic republic
will never bow to international military threats, the official
state television station reported on its website.  Iran  doesn’t “care about your bombs, warships and
planes,”  state television  cited Ahmadinejad as saying today
during a speech in the city of Karaj in Alborz province,
northwest of Tehran. “Western powers should recognize the
rights of nations and cooperate with them to survive,”
Ahmadinejad said.  Iran’s economy is being squeezed by tougher sanctions
imposed this year by the U.S. and the European Union, which say
they are needed to restrain the country’s nuclear program. The
U.S. and its allies say Iran is seeking the capability to make
an atomic bomb. Iran says its program is for civilian energy and
medical research.  President  Barack Obama  said on March 6 that there is a
“window of opportunity” for diplomacy and sanctions to compel
Iran to give up any effort to develop nuclear weapons. Two days
later, Iran’s Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  said Obama’s
comments were “good words.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
