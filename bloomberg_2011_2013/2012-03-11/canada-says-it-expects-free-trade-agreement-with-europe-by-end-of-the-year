Canada said it expects to have a
free trade deal with  Europe  completed by the end of this year.  “The major issues are now dealt with,” Gordon Campbell,
Canada’s High Commissioner to the U.K. and former premier of
British Columbia, said in an interview today on CTV’s “Question
Period” television show.  “We’ve got some very intense negotiations going on, but I
think by the end of the year we will have a deal ready for
consideration,” Campbell said.  The debt crisis in Europe, where the continent’s leaders
have been working to stave off a Greek default, shouldn’t be a
hurdle to a free trade deal, Campbell said. Europe’s economy is
still massive and the Canada-Europe Free Trade Association
Agreement would lead to 80,000 new jobs in  Canada , and add C$12
billion ($12.1 billion) to the economy, or C$1,000 on average,
to the paycheck of every Canadian, he said.  “Europe is an enormous marketplace for us,” he said.
“It’s a $17 trillion economy and, candidly, if Canada can
successfully conclude the CEFTA trade agreement, we will be the
only country in the world with that has deals with both  United
States  and Europe.”  Securing more deals with faster-growing economies of  Asia 
is also key and Canada has been making “aggressive moves” into
those markets, he said.  “We’re looking hopefully to have an agreement with  India 
by 2013,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
