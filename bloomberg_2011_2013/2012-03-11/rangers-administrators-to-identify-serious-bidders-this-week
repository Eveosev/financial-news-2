The administrators for Scottish
soccer champion Rangers have set a deadline of March 16 to
identify which parties interested in buying the club are
“serious bidders.”  Administrator Paul Clark said there has been interest
within  Scotland , elsewhere in the U.K., the Far East and “from
the American continent” and he wants to see proof of funding by
the end of the week.  “What we want is to have only serious bidders left by the
end of the week,” Clark  said in comments on the team’s website .
“I don’t care how many bidders we end up with, but I want to
know who they are, what they are and what their worth is.”  Rangers, which has won a record 54 Scottish titles, went
into administration, a form of bankruptcy, last month as U.K.
tax authorities chased the team over unpaid bills. Clark said
the aim is to install new owners before the end of this season.  Clark, a partner at administrators Duff & Phelps, said two
days ago that the club’s players accepted temporary wage cuts of
as much as 75 percent, while squad members Gregg Wylde and
Mervan Celik opted to leave Rangers.  He said the move helped to prevent job losses amongst non-
playing staff and would “ensure the continuing operations of
the club.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
