Prudential Plc (PRU)  is considering
opening a general insurance unit in  Brazil  in a bid to enter the
Latin American market, the Sunday Telegraph reported, without
saying how it got the information.  The company has lobbied the Brazilian government about
relaxing rules that prevent insurers from controlling their
sales force as current legislation only allows entry into the
bancassurance market, the Telegraph said.  Prudential spokesman Robin Tozer declined to comment on the
newspaper report when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
