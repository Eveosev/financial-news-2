The U.K. Treasury plans to charge
British banks at different rates under a loan guarantee plan to
be announced as early as March 15, according to the Sunday
Telegraph.  The plan is intended to make 20 billion pounds ($31
billion) available to small businesses and Chancellor  George Osborne  had wanted to set a single rate for the countryâ€™s five
biggest banks, the newspaper said. Instead, lenders will be
charged according to their balance sheet, the Telegraph said,
citing an unidentified government source.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Barclays Bank Plc (BARC)  spokespeople
declined to comment, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
