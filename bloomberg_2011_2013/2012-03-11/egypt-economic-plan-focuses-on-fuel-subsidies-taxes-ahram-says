Egypt ’s government may limit fuel
subsidies and introduce progressive taxes as part of its
economic reform program, the state-run Al Ahram newspaper
reported, citing Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed.  Eighty percent of fuel subsidies are enjoyed by the rich,
the newspaper reported him as saying, without providing details
on the proposals.  The government will discuss tax and subsidy changes as well
as other reforms with the country’s political and civil society
groups, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
