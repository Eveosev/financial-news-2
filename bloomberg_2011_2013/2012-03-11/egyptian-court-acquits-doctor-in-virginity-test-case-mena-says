An Egyptian military court
acquitted a military doctor accused of conducting a forced
“virginity test” on a female protester in custody at the time,
the state-run Middle East News Agency reported, in a move likely
to anger activists.  The court said it acquitted Ahmed Adel of conducting the
test after conflicting witnesses’ testimonies, MENA said.  A civilian court in December ordered that such tests should
be halted after Samira Ibrahim, a demonstrator, sued.  The case
has fueled activists’ anger at the military council, which they
accuse of mismanaging the transition after  Hosni Mubarak ’s
February ouster.  “No one violated my honor,” Ibrahim wrote on her Twitter
account today. “It’s the honor of  Egypt  that has been violated.
I will press ahead to win its rights.”  Activists have praised Ibrahim for taking the case to court
and not being deterred by potential social stigma.  Last March,  Amnesty International  called on Egyptian
authorities to investigate “serious allegations of torture,
including forced ‘virginity tests,’ inflicted by the army on
women protesters.”  -- Editor: Jennifer M. Freedman  To contact the reporter on this story:
