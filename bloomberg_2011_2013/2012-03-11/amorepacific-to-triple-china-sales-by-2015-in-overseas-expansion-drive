Amorepacific Corp. (090430) ,  South Korea ’s
biggest cosmetics maker, aims to almost triple  China  sales by
2015 as it expands in  Asia  to boost the revenue contribution
from its overseas operations.  Amorepacific, whose brands include  Laneige and Sulwhasoo ,
is targeting  sales  of about 700 billion won ($626 million) by
2015 in the world’s second-largest economy, compared with the
estimated 258 billion won it aims to bring in this year, Chief
Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Bae Dong Hyun
said. It also seeks to acquire luxury cosmetics brands in the
U.S. or  Europe  to expand its product lines, he said.  “We believe China will be our key growth engine so that we
plan to aggressively expand there by introducing more brands and
expanding distribution channels,” Bae, 56, said in an interview
at his  Seoul  office on March 8.  “We’ll look for acquisition
targets more actively to boost synergies with our existing
business.”  Amorepacific is seeking to tap overseas markets as the
domestic cosmetics industry will mature in the next few years,
Bae said. China’s beauty and personal-care products market is
expected to surge 58 percent to 255 billion yuan ($40.4 billion)
in 2015 from 2010, according to London-based researcher
Euromonitor International.  Global cosmetics makers are tapping that opportunity.
 L’Oreal SA (OR) , for instance, plans to invest 200 million yuan to
expand in Hubei, China, Xinhua News Agency said in November.
L’Oreal had 16 percent of China’s skin-care market in 2010,
compared with 11 percent for  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , 9.8 percent
for Shiseido Co. and 1.6 percent for Amorepacific, SK Securities
Co. said in a March 5 report.  Amorepacific rose 1 percent to 1.09 million won as of 12:30
p.m. in Seoul today.  Overseas Contribution  Seoul-based Amorepacific aims to boost the contribution of
 overseas sales  to 45 percent of total sales by 2020 from about
13 percent currently, Bae said. The company, which has
operations in 10 overseas nations, including China, France,
Malaysia and Thailand, is preparing to enter Indonesia and
 India , he said.  “For growth, you have to accelerate the pace of global
expansion, especially in the region where demand is expected to
grow in double digits,” Bae said. “China and ASEAN countries
meet all criteria we need for overseas expansion: economic
growth potential, disposable income, population and size of
cosmetics market.”  China’s average disposable income of urban households rose
14 percent last year, government data show. Indonesia’s middle
class grew by 62 percent from 2003 to 2010, according to World
Bank estimates.  Shares of Amorepacific have advanced 3.9 percent this year,
compared with a 10 percent gain in the Kospi index. The stock
 trades  at 20.9 times estimated profit, compared with the 18.8
multiple at L’Oreal and 24 at  Estee Lauder Cos. (EL) , according to
Bloomberg data.  The South Korean company in August last year said it agreed
to buy control of French perfume brand  Annick Goutal  from
Starwood Capital, a private-equity firm.  To contact the reporters on this story:
