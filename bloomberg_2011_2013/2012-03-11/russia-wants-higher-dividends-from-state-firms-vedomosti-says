Russia’s Economic Development
Ministry is planning to require state-controlled companies to
pay 25 percent of their profit under International Financial
Reporting Standards in dividends to shareholders, Vedomosti
said, citing draft legislation.  That figure will include profit made by the companies’
subsidiaries, the newspaper reported. Exceptions will only be
made at the request of the prime minister, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
