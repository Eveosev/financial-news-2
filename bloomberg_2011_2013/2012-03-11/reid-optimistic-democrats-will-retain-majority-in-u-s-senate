U.S. Senate  Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said he is becoming more optimistic the Democrats will
retain control of the chamber after the election in November.  “We feel really good” that the party will remain in the
majority, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said today on CNN’s “State
of the Union” program. “We have good candidates all over and I
feel very comfortable about where we are going to wind up.”  Republican Senator Olympia Snowe’s decision not to seek re-
election in Maine and former Senator Bob Kerrey’s plan to run
for the Nebraska seat being vacated by fellow Democrat Ben Nelson have improved the odds his party will keep more than half
the positions in the upper chamber of Congress, Reid said.  “We have some good things going on around the country,”
Reid said. The Senate leader also said the Democrats were having
some “good fortune” is races in  North Dakota , Massachusetts,
Arizona, and in his home state of Nevada.  To contact the reporters on this story:
