China ’s industry minister said the
price of cigarettes in the country is already “quite high” and
that the ability of higher prices to discourage smoking was yet
to be proven.  “I feel the effectiveness of raising cigarette prices
still needs to be proven through execution,” Miao Wei, Minister
of Industry and  Information Technology , told reporters today
after attending legislative meetings in Beijing. “The price of
cigarettes is already quite high and includes very high taxes.”  China is home to a third of all the world’s smokers. About
1 million people in the nation die every year from tobacco-
related illnesses, according to the  World Health Organization .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
