Ireland’s building industry
activity slowed last month,  Ulster Bank  said as its Construction
PMI index dropped.  The index fell to 45.8 in February from 46.4 in January,
Ulster Bank said in a monthly report published today. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  “The construction sector is experiencing renewed weakness
early in 2012,” Simon Barry, chief economist for the  Republic
of Ireland  at Ulster, said in an e-mailed statement. “The
February survey results show that the pace of decline in
activity accelerated further last month as the PMI fell to its
lowest level since last October.”       To contact the reporter on this story:
