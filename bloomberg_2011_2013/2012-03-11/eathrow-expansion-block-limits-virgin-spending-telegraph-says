Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.â€™s U.K.
growth is limited by a block on expanding Heathrow airport,
billionaire  Richard Branson  said in an interview with the Sunday
Telegraph.  Branson, who controls the company, said it may invest as
much as 5 billion pounds ($7.8 billion) in Britain if the
government allowed the airport to be enlarged, creating new
routes and jobs, the newspaper reported. Instead Virgin is
focusing on Australian and U.S. markets, Branson said, according
to the Sunday Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
