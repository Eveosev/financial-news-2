Indian stocks climbed for a second
day after the central bank unexpectedly cut the reserve ratio
and factory output climbed at the fastest pace in seven months.  State Bank of India , the biggest lender, jumped 3.8
percent, pacing gains among its peers.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the
largest engineering company, advanced 3.6 percent.  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the most valuable company, soared 3.2 percent.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.5 percent
to 17,587.67 at the close, paring an intraday advance of 1.5
percent. The  Reserve Bank  of India cut the cash reserve ratio by
75 basis points to 4.75 percent after trading ended on March 9,
the lowest since 2004, and factory output in January jumped 6.8
percent, after a revised 2.5 percent gain in December, the
government said today. The central bank’s rate review on March
15, a day before the presentation of the annual budget, capped
gains in the stock index, according to Peerless Mutual Fund.  “On a normal day, the reaction to the  cash reserve ratio 
cut and good industrial production number would have been much
better,” said Kaushik Dani, a  fund manager  at Peerless, which
has $880 million in assets. “Given the crucial events toward
the end of the week, the mood is cautious.”  A faster-than-estimated gain in industrial output signals
production is withstanding the impact of higher borrowing costs
on domestic demand and the fallout for exports from  Europe ’s
debt crisis. The RBI, which raised  interest rates  a record 13
times from March 2010 to October last year to cool the fastest
inflation among BRIC nations, has signaled readiness to lower
funding costs as inflation eases.  ‘Government Challenge’  Consumer prices held at close to the lowest level in 26
months in February. Still, this year’s 17 percent jump in in
Brent oil, the benchmark for almost all of  India ’s imports,
threatens to spur price rises.  “The challenge for the government and the central bank is
to boost growth without fuelling inflation,” Avinash Gupta,
vice president of equity research at Globe Capital Market Ltd.,
said in an interview from New Delhi.  The Sensex has risen 14 percent this year as foreign funds
poured $7.7 billion into shares as of March 9, a record for the
period, amid optimism the RBI will ease its monetary policy as
inflation eased. The gauge trades at 15.5 times future  earnings ,
compared with 19.4 times at the end of 2010. The  MSCI Emerging
Markets (EEM)  Index trades at 10.7 times.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India rose 0.5 percent to 5,359.55. Its April futures settled at
5,424.60. India  VIX (INVIXN) , which measures the cost of protection
against losses in the Nifty, gained 3.1 percent to 26.27, its
first climb in four days. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  added 0.7 percent.  Lenders Rally  State Bank rose 3.8 percent to 2,310.8 rupees, extending
this year’s rally to 43 percent, while  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  added 1.6
percent to 928.25 rupees. The BSE India Bankex Index added 1.2
percent, its third straight day of gains.  Larsen & Toubro climbed 3.6 percent to 1,349 rupees.
Reliance advanced 3.2 percent to 798.55 rupees.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the biggest power-equipment
maker, gained 2.2 percent to 284.95 rupees.  Havells India Ltd. (HAVL) 
climbed 3.7 percent to 580.5 rupees, leading gains on the BSE
India Capital Goods Index, which rose 2.6 percent.  Overseas  funds  bought a net  13.6 billion rupees  ($271
million) of stocks on March 9, raising their investment in local
equities this year to 381.8 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
