Israel ’s benchmark government bonds
fell, pushing the yield to the highest level in almost three
months, as stronger-than-forecast U.S. jobs data and  Greece ’s
deal on a debt swap tempered demand for safer assets.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit bond due
January 2022 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 4.73 percent at 1:18 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , the highest level
since Dec. 12. The  Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index (TEL-B40)  of corporate bonds
rose 0.1 percent to 262.69 and the  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  of stocks
advanced to the highest in almost a week.  “Investors are selling government bonds and buying stocks
and corporate bonds,” said Shuki Arditi, a bond trader at
 Leader Capital Markets (LDRC)  Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by telephone.
“The Greek debt restructuring deal and good U.S. employment
data are easing the pressure on the market, at least in the
short-term.”  Euro-area finance ministers freed up part of Greece’s
second rescue package, setting the stage for the entire 130
billion-euro ($171 billion) bailout to proceed after investors
agreed to take losses on the nation’s debt over the weekend. The
finance chiefs are scheduled to meet in Brussels on March 12 to
review the Greek aid program. Employers in the U.S. boosted
payrolls more than forecast in February, capping the best six-
month streak of job growth since 2006.  The one-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bond and fixed-rate  government bonds  of
similar maturity, fell six basis points to 276, the lowest since
March 4. That implies an average annual inflation rate of 2.76
percent.  Local funds attracted a net 405 million shekels ($107
million) in the week ended March 7, Meitav Investment House Ltd.
said today in an e-mailed report. Corporate-bond funds drew
investments of 131 million shekels and government-bond funds
raised 232 million, Meitav said.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, rose two basis points to
2.55 percent and the shekel weakened 0.7 percent to 3.7941 a
dollar on March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
