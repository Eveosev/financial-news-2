The  United Nations Security Council 
is unlikely to agree next week on a resolution calling for a
cease-fire and access to humanitarian aid in Syria because of
Russian opposition, French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe  said.  “I don’t think we will obtain this resolution,
unfortunately, because we’re bumping against Russia’s inflexible
position,” Juppe said on Europe 1 radio today. “Despite all
the efforts we’ve been making for weeks and weeks, the slaughter
is continuing.”  Russia “never really accepted” the Western-led
intervention in Libya last year, and is now taking its revenge,
Juppe said. Russia also has “major economic interests” in
Syria, including arms sales, and the country fears Islamic
influence on its territory, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
