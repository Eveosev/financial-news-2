GKN Plc (GKN)  is in talks to buy the
aerospace unit of Sweden’s  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  for 800 million pounds ($1.3
billion), the Sunday Times reported, without saying how it got
the information.  The U.K. company plans to raise about 130 million pounds
from the sale of its wheels business, which makes parts for
construction vehicles, the newspaper reported. Gleacher
Shacklock LLP is advising GKN on both transactions, it said.  A GKN spokesman, who didn’t wish to be identified by name
citing company policy, declined to comment on either of the
transactions when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
