Transportation and industrial
shares are diverging in the U.S., a signal that equity investors
are starting to agree with what the  bond market  already knows:
this economic recovery will remain sluggish for months to come.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 4.2 percent from
its six-month high on Feb. 3 through today, while the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  added 0.8 percent. The gauge of 20 shipping
companies from FedEx Corp. to  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
peaked before the rest of the market when the technology bubble
popped in 2000 and began slipping into a bear market three
months before broader benchmark indexes in 2007.  While Laszlo Birinyi, the founder of Birinyi Associates
Inc., says falling transport stocks don’t signal an end to the
three-year bull market that doubled the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX) , money managers at  Robert W. Baird  & Co. and Legg Mason
Inc. say the 27 percent rise in the index since October may have
gone too fast. Transport stocks are falling as  10-year Treasury
yields (USGG10YR)  stay near 2 percent, with economists forecasting the
slowest post-recession recovery since World War II.  “In a healthy market, everything is going in the same
direction,” Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at
Milwaukee-based Robert W. Baird, which oversees $85 billion,
said in a March 6 phone interview. “When that starts to
diverge, that raises a flag that potential trouble may be
brewing.”  China, Europe  The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,370.87  last week , with
gains in the final three days helping the index avoid its second
weekly slump of the year. Stocks advanced after U.S. employers
added more jobs than forecast, helping the  S&P 500  recover from
a 1.5 percent drop on March 6 that was the largest loss since
Dec. 8. Equities had fallen after  China  lowered its growth
target and a report showed the European economy contracted 0.3
percent last quarter. The S&P 500 ended little changed at
1,371.09 today.  Investors say they are growing concerned about the pace of
the rally, partly because Dow Theory says the transportation and
industrial averages must move higher in tandem for market
rallies to last. The gauge of railroads, trucking companies and
airlines has slumped since the end of January as the  Citigroup
Economic Surprise Index (CESIUSD) , which shows the degree to which reports
beat median estimates in Bloomberg surveys, fell 58 percent from
this year’s high.  Market Cycles  Birinyi, among the first to recommend buying stocks as the
market reached its  bear-market  bottom on March 9, 2009, said
last week that declines in shipping and smaller companies don’t
mean the rally is ending. He remains bullish, based on an
analysis of market-cycle lengths.  “The race is still on,” Birinyi, founder of the Westport,
Connecticut-based firm, said in a Bloomberg Television interview
on March 8. “There’s always something that doesn’t fit the
scenario.”  This  rally  must last another year to match the average
length of bull markets since World War II ended, according to
data compiled by Birinyi Associates. Eight of 13 lasted longer
than this one, including the eight-year advance in which the S&P
500 quadrupled through 1998 and the advance from 1982 to 1987,
when the index more than tripled, the data show.  The S&P 500 and Dow industrials rallied during  the past
five months  as demand for Treasuries kept 10-year yields no more
than 0.16 percentage point above 2 percent since Nov. 1. The
rate fell to a record low of 1.6714 percent in September as
investors sought the relative safety of  U.S. government debt  on
concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing growth in China
would derail the global recovery.  ‘Bipolar World’  “You have this bipolar world with very different views on
the direction of global economic growth,” Wayne Lin, a money
manager at Baltimore-based Legg Mason, said in a phone interview
on March 8. His firm oversaw $631 billion as of Jan. 31. “I
tend to lean a little more on the bond side just because I see
that  earnings growth  is starting to turn over and there seem to
be decelerating economic activities in Europe.”  Treasury yields slid as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  kept  interest rates  near zero since December 2008 and
expanded the central bank’s balance sheet with two rounds of
asset purchases totaling $2.3 trillion. Bernanke told lawmakers
on Feb. 29 and March 1 that elevated  unemployment  and subdued
inflation mean interest rates are likely to stay low.  Slower Growth  The  U.S. economy  will expand 2.2 percent this year,
according to the median forecasts of 79 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. While that’s up from 1.7 percent in 2011, it’s
less than the 3.7 percent  average  from 1983 to 2000.  Gross domestic product has expanded at an average annual
rate of 2.5 percent since the recession ended in June 2009,
making this the weakest recovery in at least six decades,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even though the U.S.
has grown for 10 straight quarters,  average hourly earnings  rose
1.9 percent in February, near the smallest increase since April,
and down from 3.7 percent in January 2009, Labor Department data
show.  “The economy is going to strengthen, but it’s going to be
a subpar recovery,”  Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist
at Raymond James & Associates in  St. Petersburg , Florida, said
in a phone interview on March 7. His firm oversees more than
$300 billion. A level of “1,400 is doable this year on the S&P.
Beyond that, we have to see how strong the recovery is,” he
said. Should the S&P 500 end 2012 at 1,400, it would be an 11
percent gain for the year, or the third-biggest annual advance
in six years.  Stocks of shipping companies peaked ahead of other equities
in the two previous bull markets. While the technology bubble
didn’t end until March 2000, the Dow transport average was
already down 29 percent from its peak 10 months before.  Great Depression  The measure began its retreat three months before the S&P
500 hit an all-time high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007 and gave
way to the worst economic contraction since the Great
Depression, which began after December 2007.  While S&P 500 companies exceeded  analysts’ profit forecasts 
for a 12th straight quarter, earnings-per-share for the 472
companies that reported from Jan. 9 through March 9 rose 4.9
percent for the slowest rate since 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Income will increase 13 percent  this year ,
slowing from an average rate of 16 percent in the previous three
years.  Earnings at  FedEx (FDX) , operator of the biggest cargo airline,
slipped before the 2008-2009 recession. The Memphis, Tennessee-
based company posted its first  profit decline  in more than five
years in the three months ended February 2007, about four
quarters before GDP contracted 1.8 percent.  The  shares  peaked at $120.97 on Feb. 23, 2007, almost eight
months before the S&P 500’s all-time high. Now, they are down
5.8 percent since reaching a seven-month high on Feb. 13,
compared with a 1.4 percent climb in the S&P 500.  United, Overseas Shipholding  United Continental of Chicago has helped lead airlines
lower since Feb. 3, falling 21 percent as oil futures approached
$110 a barrel in  New York .  Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. (OSG) , the
largest U.S. crude-tanker owner, plunged 30 percent in the same
period after the New York-based company said it will stop
loading cargoes in  Iran  amid tightening sanctions on the Persian
Gulf nation.  The Dow transportation gauge fell 3.1 percent  in February ,
compared with a 2.5 percent gain in the Dow industrial index.
Since 1930, there had been 20 previous months when they moved in
opposite directions and shipping companies lagged behind at
least 5.6 percentage points, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The S&P 500 lost 1.4 percent on average in the following month,
and was up 8.2 percent a year later, the data show.  “This is probably the start of something of a short-term
topping process for the S&P 500,” Gina Martin Adams, a
strategist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in New York, said in a
March 8 Bloomberg Television interview. “We’re not suggesting
it’s anything more onerous than a signal that we probably have a
little bit of a correction coming.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
