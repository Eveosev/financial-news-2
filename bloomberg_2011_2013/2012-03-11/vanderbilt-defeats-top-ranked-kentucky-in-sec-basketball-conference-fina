Vanderbilt University  ended the
top-ranked University of  Kentucky ’s 24-game winning streak with
a 71-64 victory in the  Southeastern Conference  men’s basketball
tournament final.  Also today,  Florida State University  defeated the fourth-
ranked University of  North Carolina  85-82 in the  Atlantic Coast
Conference  tournament championship game and  Michigan State
University  downed Ohio State 68-64 to take the  Big Ten 
Conference title for the first time since 2000.  Vanderbilt won on its first appearance in the Southeastern
Conference title game since 1951, when the Commodores also beat
the Wildcats. Kentucky (32-2) was denied a third straight
tournament title and 28th in school history, yet will probably
get one of the four No. 1 regional seeds when the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament field is announced
later today.  Jeffrey Taylor led Vanderbilt (24-10) with 18 points and 11
rebounds, while Festus Ezeli and  John Jenkins  contributed 17
points each for the Commodores at New Orleans Arena.  Darius Miller led the  Wildcats  with 16 points. Anthony
Davis, who was voted the league’s Player of the Year, scored 12
points and had 10 rebounds.  The 17th-ranked Seminoles (24-9) won the ACC tournament for
the first time in school history as the Tar Heels’ P.J. Hairston
missed with a 3-point attempt as time expired at Philips Arena
in Atlanta. North Carolina (29-5) may still gain a No. 1 seed in
the NCAA tournament field.  Florida State’s win comes almost two months after the
Seminoles beat the  Tar Heels  90-57 for North Carolina’s biggest
loss under coach Roy Williams.  It’s the first time that a team outside of North Carolina
has won the tournament since  Maryland  triumphed in 2004.  At Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Brandon Wood
scored a game-high 21 points as eighth-ranked Michigan State
(27-7) denied No. 7 Ohio State (27-7) a third straight Big Ten
title. After the Spartans won the Big Ten tournament for a
second time 12 years ago, they went on to claim their second
title at the NCAA tournament.  In the Atlantic 10 tournament final at Boardwalk Hall in
 Atlantic City ,  New Jersey , conference Player of the Year Andrew
Nicholson had 26 points, 14 rebounds and eight blocked shots as
 St. Bonaventure  won its first title with a 67-56 victory over
Xavier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
