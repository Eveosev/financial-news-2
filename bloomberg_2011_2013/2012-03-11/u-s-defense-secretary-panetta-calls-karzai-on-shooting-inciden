U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
called Afghanistan President  Hamid Karzai  to express his
condolences and “profound regret,” also assuring the Afghan
leader that the perpetrator will be held “fully accountable
under the law,” according to a statement from his office.  “I gave President Karzai my assurances that we will bring
those responsible to justice,” Panetta said. “We will spare no
effort in getting the facts as quickly as possible, and we will
hold any perpetrator who is responsible for this violence fully
accountable under the law.”  “As we mourn today with the Afghan people, we are
steadfast in our resolve to work hand in hand with our Afghan
partners to accomplish the missions and goals on which we have
been working together for so long,” Panetta said in his
statement. “This terrible incident does not reflect our shared
values or the progress we have made together.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
