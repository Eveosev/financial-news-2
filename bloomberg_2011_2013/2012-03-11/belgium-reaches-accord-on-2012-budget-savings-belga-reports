The Belgian government has reached
an agreement on additional savings this year to bring its  budget
deficit  within the European Union limit amid a weaker economy,
Belga reported.  At a meeting that ended late yesterday, ministers agreed to
save 1.8 billion euros ($2.4 billion) and freeze some 650
million euros of expenditures, Belga quoted Premier Elio Di Rupo
as saying. The austerity will enable Belgium to reach a deficit
goal of 2.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2012, below the
EU limit of 3 percent, the newswire said.  Details of the accord will be announced today, according to
Belga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
