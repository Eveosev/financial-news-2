The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations increased 12.31 cents to
$3.8148 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The price jump covers the two-week period ended March 9 and
is based on the Camarillo, California-based company’s survey of
about 2,500 stations. The price is 30.87 cents higher than a
year earlier, when the average was $3.5061.  Higher pump prices heading into peak summer driving season
have become an issue in this year’s U.S. presidential election.
The Obama administration said it’s monitoring prices in 360 U.S.
cities to guard against fraud or price manipulation. Republican
presidential candidates said yesterday environmental and
permitting decisions by Democrats affecting oil drilling have
exacerbated oil-price spikes.  “As refineries complete their maintenance, overall motor-
gasoline supply will become more generous, and this will
probably put a stop to the price rise,”  Trilby Lundberg , the
president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. “This of course depends on whether crude-oil prices
cooperate.”  A Washington Post-ABC News poll published today showed 65
percent of Americans surveyed disapprove of the way President
Barack Obama is handling the situation on gasoline prices, with
26 percent expressing support.  Crude Prices  Prices advanced as West Texas Intermediate crude in  New
York  fell 2.2 percent to $107.40 a barrel, while Brent oil in
 London  rose 0.4 percent to $125.98 in the two-week period from
the last survey.  Gasoline futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  jumped
17.96 cents, or 5.7 percent, to $3.3324 a gallon in the two
weeks ended March 9.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  fell 396,000 barrels in the week
ended March 2 to 229.5 million, a six-week low, the Energy
Department reported March 7.  Gasoline  consumption  slipped 1.2 percent, and the amount of
the fuel supplied over the past four weeks was 7.8 percent below
a year earlier, department data show.  Retail demand in the seven days ended March 2 declined 1.5
percent from the prior week and was 6.5 percent below a year
earlier, according to  MasterCard (MA)  Inc.’s SpendingPulse report on
March 6. Motor-fuel use during the previous four weeks was 6.3
percent below a year earlier, the 50th consecutive decline in
that measure.  Iran Tensions  Crude prices may fall this week as calls for negotiations
between nuclear powers and  Iran  may reduce tension that’s helped
bolster crude prices this year, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Fourteen of 28 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast oil will
fall through March 16. Ten respondents, or 36 percent, predicted
prices will rise and four estimated there will be little change.
Last week, 56 percent of surveyed analysts expected an increase.  Crude-oil  supplies  rose 832,000 barrels to 345.7 million in
the seven days through March 2, according to the department, the
highest level since September.  Inventories (DOESCROK)  at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate
oil, increased 2.37 million barrels to 36.2 million, the highest
level since July.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline increased to $4 a gallon,
according to Lundberg. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged
$4.35.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in  Los Angeles , Lundberg said. The lowest
price was in Denver,  Colorado , where customers paid an average
of $3.36 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
