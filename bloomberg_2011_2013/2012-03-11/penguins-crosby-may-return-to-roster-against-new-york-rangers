Pittsburgh Penguins captain  Sidney Crosby , who has missed 59 games during the past two seasons, may
return to the roster when his team travels to Madison Square
Garden to meet the  New York Rangers .  Crosby, 24, wants to take advantage of next week’s
practices before getting back on the ice March 15 against the
Rangers, who lead the Eastern Conference’s  Atlantic Division ,
four points ahead of the Penguins.  “The good thing is we’ve got a good chunk of practices
here next week,” Crosby told reporters. “We’ll see how that
goes, and hopefully, it’s soon.”  Crosby sustained head injuries in last year’s Jan. 1 Winter
Classic against the  Washington Capitals  and again four days
later against the  Tampa Bay Lightning . He missed the rest of the
2010-11 season.  Crosby returned to the ice this season for eight games
until he was sidelined when concussion-like symptoms returned
during a game against Boston on Dec. 5. After that collision, he
was diagnosed with a soft-tissue injury in his neck.  “I still think I need to get to another level as far as
the extent of the physicality out there,” Crosby said. “Making
sure I’m ready to play the way I need to and be well tested is
what’s most important. So hopefully we’ll get that in the next
couple of days.”  Crosby originally wanted to play in today’s game against
the  Boston  Bruins. He decided against it after the practice
schedule for the week was changed.  “This is something you don’t want to mess around with,
especially at this time of year, when it’s even more physical
than ever,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
