Peyton Manning  arrived this morning
for talks with the  Arizona Cardinals  at the National Football
League teamâ€™s headquarters, the Associated Press reported.  The free-agent quarterback, who missed the 2011 season
after undergoing neck surgeries, showed up with Arizona coach
Ken Whisenhunt, AP said.  The Cardinals are the second team 35-year-old Manning has
visited since being released by the Indianapolis Colts March 7,
the report said. He also had talks March 9 in Denver with the
Broncos, it said.  Four-time NFL Most Valuable Player Manning was cut after 14
years with the Colts, where he won a Super Bowl title. The
decision came a day before Indianapolis would have had to pay
him a $28 million bonus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
