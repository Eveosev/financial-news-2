Currency trading  may have risen to
a record $5 trillion a day in September, surpassing the peak
reached before  Lehman Brothers (LEHMQ)  Holdings Inc.’s collapse in 2008,
according to the  Bank for International Settlements .  Trading then declined to about $4.7 trillion a day in
October and is likely to have fallen considerably in early 2012,
the Basel, Switzerland-based bank said in a report. The BIS said
it derived its estimates from supplementing the data in its
foreign-exchange survey, which is undertaken every three years,
with information collected from central banks and electronic-
trading platforms.  The surveys found currency trading kept increasing in the
first year of the financial crisis, climbing to about $4.5
trillion a day in September 2008, shortly before Lehman’s
collapse, Morten Bech, a senior economist at the BIS, wrote in
the research paper. Average daily trading volume then plunged to
$3 trillion in April 2009, he wrote.  “By mid-2009, global foreign-exchange activity had started
to pick up again and it rose to $4 trillion a day in April
2010,” Bech wrote. “Our measure shows the foreign-exchange
activity may have reached $5 trillion a day in September 2011,
before dropping off considerably by the end of the year.”  Trading Surges  Foreign-exchange trading has surged as central banks
including the  Federal Reserve  flooded markets with cash to
combat the global financial crisis.  Japan  intervened to help its
exporters after a record earthquake and tsunami a year ago,
while the Swiss central bank imposed a cap to stem franc
strength in September. Efforts to boost growth by protecting
exports started a “currency war,” Brazil Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  said in September 2010.  The dollar traded at $1.3109 per euro at 8:42 a.m. in
London, up 0.1 percent from last week. The greenback slid 0.3
percent to 82.24 yen after rising to 82.65 on March 9, the
strongest since April 27.  Bech said the recent data showed London remained the center
with the highest volume of foreign-exchange trading, followed by
 New York .  “The turnover in the United Kingdom dwarfs that of any
other market center,” he wrote. “At slightly over $2 trillion
per day in April 20111, its reported volume was larger than the
other surveyed markets put together.”  Volatility  Implied volatility of three-month options on Group of Seven
currencies as tracked by the JPMorgan G7  Volatility Index (JPMVXYG7) 
climbed to 26.6 percent on Oct. 24, 2008, the most since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1992. The gauge reached a
15-month high of 15.8 percent on Sept. 23 before falling to as
low as 9.71 on Feb. 24.  A lower figure makes investments in currencies with higher
benchmark lending rates more attractive as the risk in such
trades is that market moves will erase profits.  The BIS report differs from its triennial currency survey,
with the next one scheduled for April 2013. In the previous
survey published in September 2010, it said the average daily
trading volume increased 20 percent from 2007 to $4 trillion.  The  BIS  supplemented its survey data with information taken
from central-bank sponsored industry groups in the U.K.,  North
America ,  Canada ,  Singapore , Japan and  Australia . It also took
data from electronic-trading systems operated by EBS and  Thomson
Reuters , Hotspot FX and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  The BIS also used data from  CLS Bank , the New York-based
operator of the largest currency-trading settlement system. CLS
handled an average of $4.5 trillion per day in 2011, compared
with $2 trillion in early 2005, according to the BIS report.  “While good and timely data are available on prices of
foreign-exchange instruments, the same is not true for trading
activity,” Bech wrote. “In this article, I show how it is
possible to leverage alternative sources of FX activity to
obtain a timelier grasp of turnover developments.”  The BIS was formed in 1930 and acts as a central bank for
the world’s monetary authorities. It has published the triennial
survey since 1989.  To contact the reporters on this story:
