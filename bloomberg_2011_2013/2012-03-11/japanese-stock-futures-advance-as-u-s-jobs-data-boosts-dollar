Japanese  stock   futures  rose after
better-than-expected U.S. jobs data pushed the dollar to a 10-
month high against the yen, boosting the earnings outlook for
the Asian nation’s exporters. Australian equities were little
changed.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics, rose 2 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , Japan’s
largest construction machinery maker whose biggest market is
China, advanced 0.5 percent on speculation China’s economic
slowdown may prompt the government to expedite stimulus
measures.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s mining company, added
0.5 percent after metal and commodity prices gained.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 9,950 in Chicago on March 9, compared with 9,840
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,960 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200  Index (CRY) 
swung between gains and losses today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
gained 0.3 percent in Wellington.  “The downside risk to U.S. growth is fairly limited from
here,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment
strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment
Group, which manages about $150 billion. “Five months ago, the
markets were so cheap because of fears of Europe’s financial
meltdown and another U.S. downturn. Now that both of those fears
have been alleviated somewhat, the markets have been
reweighted.”  U.S. Labor Market  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent
today. The index rose 0.4 percent in  New York  on March 9 after a
227,000 increase in payrolls last month topped the median
projection of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The jobless
rate held at 8.3 percent.  The dollar touched 82.65 yen on March 9, the highest level
since April 27. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income
at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Economists expect a Japanese government report today will
show machinery orders gained 2.3 percent in January after
falling 7.1 percent in December. The report is due at 8:50 a.m.
Tokyo time. The Bank of Japan will also start a two-day policy
meeting today.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 11.5 percent this year
through last week, compared with a 9 percent advance by the  S&P
500  and an 8.6 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500
and 11.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese Stocks  China Mobile Ltd., the world’s biggest phone carrier by
users, surged to the highest level since 2009 and led gains in
U.S.-traded Chinese stocks on March 9 after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Credit Suisse AG recommended buying the shares. The
Bloomberg China-US 55 index of the most-traded Chinese companies
in the U.S. rose 0.8 percent to 104.22.  China posted its largest trade deficit since at least 1989
last month as Europe’s sovereign-debt turmoil damped exports and
imports rebounded after a weeklong holiday, the government
reported on March 10.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum rose 1.9 percent
on March 9. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index (CRY)  of raw
