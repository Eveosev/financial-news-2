Qatar is drafting its first
mortgage law,  the Peninsula said , without saying how the
information was obtained.  The law is being drafted by the Qatar Chamber of Commerce

the newspaper said. The law would also create a “benchmark”
for lenders and property developers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
