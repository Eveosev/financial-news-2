European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said the bank’s new inflation
forecasts are more benign than headline figures suggest and
that’s it’s too early for officials to talk about an exit
strategy from emergency operations,  Japan ’s Nikkei said, citing
an interview.   “The increase in inflation is due to two external factors:
mostly, commodity prices, and the taxes which have been decided
by governments,” Coeure was cited as saying in the interview, a
transcript of which was distributed by the ECB. “It is not due
to monetary developments.”  Coeure said the time is not ripe to decide on how the ECB
should withdraw the emergency liquidity deployed to fight the
European debt crisis, though officials should consider options,
Nikkei said. He said the ECB’s emergency bond program will
remain in place “for some time,” though the recent easing in
market turmoil has limited the need for its use in recent weeks,
Nikkei reported.   Coeure said he doesn’t want  Europe ’s  bond market  to be
fragmented as a result of the ECB’s decision to offer banks
unlimited cash for three years.   “We have seen banks in some countries buying bonds issued
by the domestic sovereign,” he was cited as saying. “We would
not like this to result in a lasting fragmentation of the
European bond market. The proper function of  capital markets  in
Europe, cross-country lending and borrowing should be restored.
Local use of savings would not be constructive for the
functioning of capital markets in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
