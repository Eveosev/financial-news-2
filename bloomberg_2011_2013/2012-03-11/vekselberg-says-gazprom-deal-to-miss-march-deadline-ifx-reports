OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  and Russian billionaire
 Viktor Vekselberg ’s IES Holding plan to go ahead with a merger
of their power utilities even while missing a deadline to close
the deal at the end of this month, Interfax said, citing an
March 7 interview with the businessman in Cannes,  France .  The two parties had moved the deadline after failing to
complete the merger by the end of last year. The billionaire
said in January that the deal, announced in July last year,
would be abandoned if the two parties couldn’t agree by the end
of the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
