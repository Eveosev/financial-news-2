Ormat Industries Ltd. (ORMT)  gained the
most in two weeks as the developer of geothermal  power plants 
said its controlling shareholder is in advanced talks to sell
part of its stake.  The shares jumped 2.4 percent to 16.93 shekels at the 4:30
p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The stock has fallen 32 percent in the
past 12 months compared with a 14 percent drop for the TA-100
Index.  The Bronicki family, which has a 35 percent stake in the
company, is in talks with Fimi Opportunity Funds, which holds
10.5 percent. A deal would give the two shareholders equal
stakes in the company, Ormat said in a statement to the Tel-Aviv
Stock Exchange today.  “The news is good,” Guil Bashan, an analyst at the Tel
Aviv-based I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd., said by
phone today. “It will mean an end to the infighting and the
management-ownership situation that has been weighing on the
company and on the share price,”  Ormat Industries’ U.S. unit,  Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , said
Jan. 30 that revenue will decline by almost $25 million in 2012
and 2013. The unit’s contracts with California power plants were
affected by a decrease in gas-price forecasts and the delay of
the state’s greenhouse-gas cap-and-trade program, which is now
expected to begin in 2013, Ormat Technologies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
