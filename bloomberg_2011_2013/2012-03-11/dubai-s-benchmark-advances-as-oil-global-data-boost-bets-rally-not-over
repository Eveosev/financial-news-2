Dubai’s shares surged the most in
more than two years as oil rose and investors bet stronger-than-
forecast U.S. jobs data will bolster global growth, helping the
emirate’s benchmark index extend a rally.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the United Arab Emirates’ biggest
construction company, surged the most since 2010.  Dubai
Financial Market PJSC (DFM)  soared 9.7 percent. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
rallied 4.7 percent, the largest advance since December 2009, to
1,686.66, at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The  Bloomberg GCC
200 (BGCC200)  Index of Persian Gulf stocks added 1.1 percent.  Dubai’s shares have rallied  25 percent so far this year 
after improved earnings and dividends boosted investor
confidence. They posted their first weekly drop since January
last week, tumbling 5.4 percent amid speculation the surge may
have been overdone. A U.S. report showing the best six-month
streak of job growth since 2006 helped lift the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  0.4 percent on March 9.  “With international markets performing well, local
sentiment has picked up,” said Ziad Dabbas, a financial analyst
at  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , the U.A.E.’s second-biggest
bank by assets. “After the strong correction last week, some
believe this is an opportunity to go back in. We feel the market
may ultimately continue to improve in the long term.”  In the U.S., the 227,000 increase in payrolls last month
topped the median projection of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The jobless rate in the world’s largest economy held at
8.3 percent and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
the labor market remains “far from normal,” a sign policy
makers continue to see merit in keeping  interest rates  low for
several years.  About  503 million shares  were traded in Dubai today,
compared with the 12-month daily average of 135 million shares.  Oil Climbs  Oil for April delivery increased 0.7 percent last week to
$107.4 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gulf Arab
oil exporters, including Qatar and the U.A.E., supply about a
fifth of the world’s oil. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) 
advanced 0.7 percent on March 9.  Arabtec increased 9.7 percent, the most since March 2010,
to 2.93 dirhams. Dubai Financial Market surged the most since
March 4 to 1.24 dirhams.  Emirates Integrated Telecommunications
Co. (DU)  advanced 2 percent to 3.12 dirhams. The U.A.E.’s second-
biggest phone company said last week it plans to pay its first
dividend.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  increased 1 percent, the most
since Feb. 26. Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  advanced
0.5 percent. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index advanced 0.7
percent.  Kuwait’s Stock Exchange Price Index (KWSEIDX)  decreased 0.4
percent. Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  fell 1 percent, snapping a
four-day rally.  In North Africa, the  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  slumped 1.8 percent. In
Israel, the  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  gained 0.5 percent. The yield on the
country’s 5.5 percent notes due January 2022 rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
