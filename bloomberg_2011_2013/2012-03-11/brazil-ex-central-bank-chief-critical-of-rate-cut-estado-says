Former Brazil central bank
President Gustavo Loyola said the 0.75 percentage point interest
rate cut this month could cause a “headache” for the country,
with an overheated economy and accelerating inflation toward the
end of the year,  O Estado de Sao Paulo  reported, citing an
interview.  Loyola was head of the central bank in 1992-1993 and from
1995 to 1997.  To contact the reporters on this story:
