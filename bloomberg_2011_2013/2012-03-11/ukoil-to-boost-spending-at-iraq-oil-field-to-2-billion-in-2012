OAO Lukoil (LKOH) ,  Russia ’s biggest non-
state company by market value, plans to boost investments in the
West Qurna-2 oil field in  Iraq  to about $2 billion this year.  Lukoil plans to carry out drilling and begin construction
of a pipeline as it prepares the field for the start of
production, the Moscow-based crude producer  said  in a corporate
newsletter published on the website today.  The company invested more than $200 million in the project
last year, Grigory Volchek, a Moscow-based spokesman for the
company’s overseas unit, said by phone today.  Iraq approved the sale of  Statoil ASA (STL) ’s 18.75 percent in
the field to Lukoil, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said
March 7. Lukoil and  Norway ’s state-controlled Statoil won the
rights to develop the second phase of the West Qurna field in
December 2009, agreeing to produce 1.8 million barrels a day
from the field in southern Iraq about 40 miles (65 kilometers)
northwest of Basra, for a fee of $1.15 a barrel.  Volchek declined to comment on any agreement with Statoil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
