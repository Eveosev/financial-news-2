The  Crown Estate , which operates
property on behalf of the U.K. government and the British
monarchy, may sell suburban land to raise funds for developments
in central  London  and offshore energy projects, the  Sunday
Telegraph  said.  Towns such as Luton, Hemel Hempstead and Taunton could be
rapidly developed by 2020, the newspaper said, citing Paul
Clark, investment director for Crown Estate. The body would
secure planning consent before selling its properties and has
not set a target for how much it wants to raise, according to
the Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
