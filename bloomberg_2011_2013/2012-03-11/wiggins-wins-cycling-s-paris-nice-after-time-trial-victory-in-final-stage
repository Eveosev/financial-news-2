Bradley Wiggins won cycling’s
Paris-Nice race after victory in the final stage time-trial to
become the first British champion since 1967.  Wiggins finished two seconds ahead of his nearest
challenger, Lieuwe Westra of the Netherlands, in today’s 9.6-
kilometer (6-mile) stage to stretch his margin of victory to
eight seconds.  Spain ’s Alejandro Valverde was third overall.  Wiggins, 31, who rides for Team Sky, had held the race lead
since the second stage on March 5.  Tom Simpson was the only previous British winner of the
event, which was being held for a 70th time.      To contact the editor responsible for this story:
