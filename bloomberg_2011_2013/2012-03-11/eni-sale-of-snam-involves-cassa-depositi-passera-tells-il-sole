Talks on  Eni SpA (ENI) ’s forced sale of
its half of Italian gas distributor  Snam Rete Gas SpA (SRG)  involves
state-controlled lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti,  Il Sole 24
Ore  said, citing an interview with Development Minister Corrado
Passera published today.  Passera said Cassa Depositi has a role in the talks
because it’s an Eni shareholder, without elaborating on whether
the lender is a possible buyer, according to the newspaper.  Separately, Passera told Il Sole that  Italy ’s government
may invest in a broadband Internet project that doesn’t involve
 Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , the country’s largest phone company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
