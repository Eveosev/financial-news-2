U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick
Clegg  said Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  must use
his March 21 budget statement to take low earners out of paying
tax and increase the revenue raised from high earners.  “Too often, rather than paying their dues, the wealthy pay
their accountants to get them out of it,” Clegg told his
Liberal Democrat Party’s spring conference today in Gateshead,
northeast  England . “The budget in 10 days time must offer
concrete help to hard-pressed, hard-working families: a big
increase in the income-tax threshold.”  The coalition government is committed to raising the
threshold at which people start paying income tax to 10,000
pounds ($15,670) by 2015. Clegg said today he wants Osborne, a
Conservative, to go “further and faster” towards that goal.  At the other end of the income scale, Clegg pledged his
party would “call time on the tycoon tax dodgers and make sure
everyone pays a fair level of tax.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
