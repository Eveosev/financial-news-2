Brazil President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
government will announce measures next week to boost demand and
target economic growth of 4 to 5 percent this year, O Estado de
Sao Paulo newspaper reported, citing an interview with Trade
Minister Fernando Pimentel.  The measures are intended to complement the central bank’s
0.75 percentage point interest rate cut this month, and will be
announced jointly by the  Finance Ministry , the Trade Ministry,
and the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said, citing Pimentel. Pimentel declined to say what
the measures will be, the newspaper said.  Pimentel also said the government is studying the
possibility of extending tax breaks for household goods such as
stoves and washing machines, according to Estado.  To contact the reporters on this story:
