Boos rang out around Madison Square
Garden as the  New York Knicks  lost their fifth straight game,
106-94 at home against the  Philadelphia 76ers .  Since going on a seven-game winning run after Harvard
University graduate Jeremy Lin came off the bench to take over
as point guard Feb. 4, the Knicks have lost eight of 11 games to
dent their chances of reaching the National Basketball
Association playoffs.  Lou Williams led the 76ers with 28 points and Evan Turner
had 24 points and 15 rebounds today as Philadelphia improved to
25-17 this season with its third straight win. The Knicks
dropped to 18-23 and are in eighth place in the Eastern
Conference, with the top eight teams making the playoffs.  The Knicks are winless in March and gave up 118 and 119
points in losses at the  San Antonio Spurs  and the  Milwaukee
Bucks  without injured center Tyson Chandler. Chandler, who leads
the Knicks in defensive and total rebounds per game, had 12
rebounds today in his return.  The Knicks trailed 51-49 at halftime as they committed 10
turnovers to Philadelphia’s six. Lin ended the half with five
points, four assists and three turnovers, while Carmelo Anthony
had a game-leading 14 points in the opening two quarters.  The 76ers opened a 73-62 lead with three minutes, 49
seconds remaining in the third quarter as they capped an 8-0
scoring run with a four-point play after Anthony fouled Andre Iguodala as he made a 3-point shot. The visitors outscored  New
York  38-24 in the third quarter to push their lead to 89-73.  The Knicks couldn’t close the gap and trailed 104-89 with
3:05 to play.  Steve Novak  then made a 3-point jump shot and J.R.
Smith added two points from the free-throw line to complete New
York’s scoring.  New York was held to 41 percent shooting.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
