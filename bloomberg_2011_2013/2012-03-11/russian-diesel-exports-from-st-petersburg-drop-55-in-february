Russian diesel exports from the  St.
Petersburg  terminal dropped 55 percent in February from a year
earlier, a port official said.  Shipments fell to 101,000 metric tons from 222,000 tons a
year earlier, the official said today by phone from St.
Petersburg, declining to be identified because the information
is confidential.  Exports of  fuel oil  from the Baltic Sea port increased 22
percent to 505,000 tons last month from 414,000 tons a year
earlier, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
