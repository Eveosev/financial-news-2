Bubba Watson takes a three-stroke
lead over  Justin Rose  and Keegan Bradley into the final round of
the Cadillac Championship, the second event in this year’s World
Golf Championships series.  Watson fired a 5-under 67 yesterday at the TPC Blue Monster
Course in Doral, Florida. His 17-under 199 is the best 54-hole
score since the tournament moved to this course in 2007.  “Obviously I’m learning how to play it,” Watson told
reporters. “I think this year the greens are a little soft, so
you can hit balls out of the rough. The course is just soft.
It’s very challenging.”  Rose, an Englishman, bogeyed his final hole to shoot a
three-under 69, while Bradley of the U.S. had a 6-under 66 to
join Rose in second place. Sweden’s  Peter Hanson  was alone in
fourth at 12-under par after a 3-under 69.  Tiger Woods and World No. 1 Rory McIlroy of Northern
Ireland were tied eight strokes off the lead at 9-under 207.
Woods and McIlroy are joined by  Luke Donald  and  Germany ’s  Martin Kaymer ,  Webb Simpson  and Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of
South Africa.  “I never thought I would stand up here and say I’m
disappointed with seven under, but today is definitely one of
those days,” said McIlroy, who shot a third-round 65.  Woods tallied a 68 after birdies on two of the three final
holes, including the 18th.  “I hit a sweet drive down there,” Woods said. “That was
nice. I tried to hit the same drive I hit off of 16 and just
roasted it down there. I hit it, turned over a little bit with
the wind and ended up pretty good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
