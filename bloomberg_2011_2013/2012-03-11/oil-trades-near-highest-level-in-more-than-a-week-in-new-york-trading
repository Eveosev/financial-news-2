Oil fell from the highest price in
more than a week after exports grew more slowly than forecast in
 China , the world’s second-largest crude consumer, signaling an
economic slowdown.  Futures in  New York  slid as much as 0.8 percent, erasing
last week’s gain. China had its biggest trade deficit last month
in at least 22 years as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis damped
exports, a March 10 report by the customs bureau showed.
Overseas shipments increased 18 percent, below a median estimate
of 31 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  Hedge funds  reduced
bullish bets on oil for the first time in five weeks, according
to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  “The data from China is a downside pressure on the oil
market, said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity-derivative sales manager
at Newedge Group in  Tokyo  who predicts oil will trade in a range
from $105 to $110 a barrel this week in New York. ‘‘The trade
deficit is much bigger than expected.’’  Crude for April delivery declined as much as 87 cents to
$106.53 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It was at $106.86 at 3:20 p.m. Singapore
time. The contract climbed 82 cents to $107.40 a barrel on March
9, the highest settlement since March 1. Prices are up 8 percent
in 2012.  Brent oil for April settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange lost as much as 76 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $125.22 a barrel. The European benchmark contract
was at a premium of $18.62 to New York-traded West Texas
Intermediate grade, compared with a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Fibonacci Support  Oil in New York has technical support at $103.39 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the weekly chart,
that is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop to
$32.40 in December 2008 from a record high of $147.27 in July
that year. Buy orders tend to be clustered near support levels.  China’s trade deficit follows reports last week that showed
the weakest January-to-February gain in factory production since
2009 and retail sales falling below estimates. China accounted
for about 11 percent of global oil demand in 2010, according to
 BP Plc (BP/) ’s annual Statistical Review of World Energy. The U.S.
consumed 21 percent.  Large speculators including hedge funds cut wagers on
rising oil prices as concern eased about risks tied to Iran.
Net-long positions in futures and options combined fell by 7.3
percent in the week ended March 6, the CFTC said in its
Commitments of Traders report March 9.  ‘Window of Opportunity’  U.S. President Barack Obama said March 6 that there is a
‘‘window of opportunity” for diplomacy and sanctions to compel
Iran to give up any effort to develop nuclear weapons.  Catherine Ashton , the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said world
powers are ready to resume talks with the Persian Gulf nation.  Iran  will never bow to international military threats,
state television reported President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as
saying yesterday. The country is the second-largest producer
after  Saudi Arabia  in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, which pumps about a third of the world’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
