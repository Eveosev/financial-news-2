Game Group Plc (GMG) , the U.K.’s biggest
independent video-games retailer, is seeking a buyer to avert a
financial collapse, the Sunday Times reported, without saying
how it obtained the information.  Banque Privee Edmond de Rothschild has been hired as an
adviser for the sale and Deloitte LLP will be charged with
overseeing any insolvency proceedings, the newspaper said.  A Game Group spokesman contacted by Bloomberg News today
said the company doesn’t comment on press speculation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
