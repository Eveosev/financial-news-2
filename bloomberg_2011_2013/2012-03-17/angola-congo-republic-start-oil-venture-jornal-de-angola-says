Angola  and the Republic of Congo
agreed to jointly exploit an oil field on their border and share
profits equally, Jornal de Angola said.  The field has estimated crude reserves of 60 million
barrels, the Luanda-based newspaper said, citing the oil
ministers of both countries, Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos
from Angola, and Andre Luemba of the Congo Republic.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  will operate the field, Jornal de Angola
said. Revenues will be paid into an account held in an Angolan
bank, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
