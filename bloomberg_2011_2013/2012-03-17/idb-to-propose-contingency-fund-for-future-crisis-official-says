The  Inter-American Development Bank 
will ask its members to consider a contingency fund to help
countries maintain spending in the event of a future crisis,
said an official of the Washington-based lender.  The proposal would aid countries in sustaining funding for
social development, infrastructure and small and medium-sized
businesses, said Koldo Echebarria, manager of the IDB’s Office
of Strategic Planning and Development Effectiveness.  The IDB’s Board of Governors is analyzing the Latin
American and Caribbean impact of the European debt crisis and
exploring measures to strengthen the region’s economies at their
annual meetings today in Montevideo, Uruguay. The meetings will
continue through March 19.  “The bank is discussing a series of instruments countries
would be able to tap in a preventative manner for priority
spending projects,” Echebarria said in Montevideo, without
giving details on the size of the proposed fund.  Established in 1959, the IDB is the biggest source of
development financing for  Latin America  and the Caribbean,
according to its website. The lender has 48 members, including
the U.S.,  Brazil  and  Mexico .  In January, the IDB’s board approved a $70 billion capital
increase. Members will inject $1.7 billion over five years and
pledge to make the remaining amount available if needed, the IDB
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
