Sudan security forces arrested five
teachers after they demanded better pay, a change to the
curriculum to scrap Islamic instruction and free education, a
group of teacher activists said.  The teachers, all members of Teachers for Change, were
arrested at their homes in Wad Madany, Al Jazirah state, Aziza
Youssef, a member of the movement started in 2009, said by phone
