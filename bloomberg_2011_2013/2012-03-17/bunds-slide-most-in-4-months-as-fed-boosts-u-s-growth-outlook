German bunds fell, driving yields
to their biggest weekly increase since November, as Federal
Reserve policy makers raised their assessment of the  U.S.
economy , damping demand for the euro-region’s safest assets.  German 10-year yields climbed to the highest in three
months as Italian and Spanish borrowing costs fell at bond
auctions. The Fed raised its economic outlook on March 13, while
data two days later showed claims for jobless benefits in the
U.S. dropped to match a four-year low. The yield on Spain’s 10-
year bond rose for a  second week  as finance ministers prodded
the nation to make deeper budget cuts.  Safer assets such as bunds “have underperformed over the
past week, driven by a combination of improvements in underlying
U.S. economic data, more upbeat commentary by the Fed, and
continued positive auction results in  Spain  and Italy,” said
 Brian Barry , a strategist at Investec Bank Plc in  London .
“Concerns over the outlook for the periphery still remain
however, as evidenced by the Spanish 10-year yield trending
higher over the last week.”  German 10-year yields rose 26 basis points, or 0.26
percentage point, to 2.05 percent at 4:23 p.m. London time
yesterday, the biggest increase since the five-day period ending
Nov. 25. The rate climbed to 2.07 percent, the highest since
Dec. 13. The 2 percent bond due January 2022 lost 2.295, or
22.95 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.535.  Two-year (GDBR2)  yields climbed 17 basis points this week to 0.33
percent.  Yields Near Lows  Bund yields remained about 40 basis points from their
record low even after  Greece  won a second bailout and Italian
rates dropped after the second round of ECB longer-term
refinancing operation loans.  That “seemed incongruous with the ‘good news’ of the Greek
restructuring and the second three-year LTRO,” Jamie Searle, a
fixed-income strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in a
client note yesterday. “In the end, it has taken events in the
U.S. to take 10-year bund yields higher.”  Spanish bonds fell even after borrowing costs slid at an
auction. European finance chiefs meeting in Brussels early in
the week called on Spain to prune an additional 0.5 percent of
gross domestic product out of its 2012 budget. Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  on March 2 unilaterally raised the country’s 2012
deficit target to 5.8 percent.  Spanish, Italian Sales  Spain sold 976 million euros of 3.25 percent notes due
April 2016 at an average yield of 3.37 percent, compared with
3.75 percent when the notes were sold in January.  Italy ’s three-year borrowing costs fell to a 17-month low
March 14 as the nation sold 5 billion euros of 2.5 percent notes
due March 2015 at an average yield of 2.76 percent, the lowest
since October 2010.  Spain’s  10-year (GSPG10YR)  yield climbed 20 basis points this week to
5.20 percent. The yield on similar maturity Italian debt rose
three basis points to 4.86 percent.  The European Financial Stability Facility bailout fund
plans to sell as much as 1.5 billion euros of debt maturing in
between 20 and 30 years on March 19 and 3 billion euros or more
in benchmark five-year notes on March 22, Klaus Regling, chief
executive officer of the 440 billion-euro fund said yesterday.  Greece plans to sell 1 billion euros of 91-day treasury
bills on March 20, while  Portugal  is scheduled to auction 119-
and 364-day bills on March 21.  To contact the reporters on this story:
