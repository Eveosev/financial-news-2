Ethiopia ’s government denied a
Reuters report that it made further attacks inside  Eritrea .  “That’s not correct,” Getachew Reda, the Foreign
Ministry’s public diplomacy and communications director, said by
phone from Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, today. “There’s
been no further attacks” after a raid two days ago inside
Eritrea’s territory, he said.  Ethiopian troops today carried out more attacks on rebels
in the north of Eritrea around Badme, Reuters said, citing an
unidentified Ethiopian government official.  Three military posts where the Eritrean government trained
rebels hostile to Ethiopia were targeted on March 15, State
Minister of Communications Shimeles Kemal said.  “The information is false,” he said by phone today about
the Reuters report. “It’s an absolute lie.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
