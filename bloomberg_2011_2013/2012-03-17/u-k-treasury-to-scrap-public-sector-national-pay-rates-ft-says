U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  will introduce regional pay rates for public
sector workers in the coming budget, the Financial Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  About 140,000 civil servants will be affected by the
change, which will see pay freezes in some parts of Britain to
align public and private sector wages, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
