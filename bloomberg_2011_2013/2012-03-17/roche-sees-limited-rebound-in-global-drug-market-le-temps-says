The head of  Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s
pharmaceutical division expects a small rebound in the global
drug market once patent expiries on major products have passed,
Switzerland’s Le Temps  reported .  The recovery will be “fairly limited,” Pascal Soriot,
chief operating officer of Roche’s pharma unit, said in an
interview with the newspaper. The U.S. market will grow by 3
percent at most and  Europe  will stagnate over the next three to
five years, the report quoted Soriot as saying. Roche aims to
expand sales faster than the market in emerging countries and in
line with the market in Europe and the U.S., he said.  Roche is also experimenting with various pricing models in
 emerging markets , Tages Anzeiger reported, citing an interview
with Franz Humer, the Basel, Switzerland-based drugmaker’s
chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
