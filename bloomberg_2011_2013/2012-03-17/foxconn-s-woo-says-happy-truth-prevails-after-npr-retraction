(Corrects story published March 17 to clarify that NPR
doesn’t produce program involved.)  Foxconn Technology Group, Apple
Inc.’s largest supplier and the target of allegations of poor
 work conditions , welcomed a retraction of a U.S. radio program
episode it said was based on lies.  “I am happy that the truth prevails, I am glad that  Mike
Daisey ’s lies were exposed. But I don’t think that the reports
about this have gone far enough to find out what exactly is the
truth,” Louis Woo, spokesman for Taipei-based Foxconn said by
phone.  The weekly radio program “This American Life” retracted a
report on conditions of Chinese workers who construct Apple Inc.
products, saying the broadcast contained “errors” and
“fabrications.” The episode, first aired Jan. 6, centered on a
monologue by Daisey.  “This American Life” airs on National Public Radio
stations and is produced by Chicago Public Media and distributed
by Public Radio International.  “People will have the impression that Foxconn is a bad
company, so I hope they will come and find out for themselves,”
Woo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
