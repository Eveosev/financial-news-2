The living standards of young
British people have been overtaken by those of their
grandparents for the first time, the Financial Times reported,
citing official data.  The disposable household incomes of those in their 20s have
stagnated in the past 10 years and fallen below those of people
in their 60s for the first time since official household income
data were collected 50 years ago, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
