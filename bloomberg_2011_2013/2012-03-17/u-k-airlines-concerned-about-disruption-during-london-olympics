The U.K.’s largest airlines,
including  British Airways Plc (IAG)  and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.,
said they’re concerned about potential delays at  London  airports
during the 2012  Olympic Games   “The industry believes that there is a significant risk of
severe delay and disruption at all of London’s major airports
unless urgent action is taken,” airlines including British
Airways, Virgin Atlantic, British Midland International and
 EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  said in a letter dated March 15 to U.K. Transport
Secretary Justine Greening and other officials.  “Failure to respond leaves the U.K. vulnerable to the type
of major disruption that will cause significant reputational
damage and would be foolhardy and reckless,” the letter said.  The London Olympics will attract more than 320,000 foreign
visitors, national tourism agency VisitBritain has said, citing
a study conducted by Oxford Economics. Brussels, Amsterdam and
Paris are also seeing an increase in travel during the Olympics
period, Madrid-based Amadeus and Barcelona-based Forward Data
said in a report this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
