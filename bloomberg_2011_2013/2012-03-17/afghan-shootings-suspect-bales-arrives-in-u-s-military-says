U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Robert
Bales, the suspect in the killings of at least 16 Afghan
civilians, arrived at the U.S. militaryâ€™s maximum-security
prison in  Kansas , the Army said.  The Pentagon for the first time today cited the name of the
38-year-old sniper, who has yet to be charged in the case. After
being held in  Afghanistan  and then  Kuwait , Bales was flown to
Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, according to an e-mailed Army
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
