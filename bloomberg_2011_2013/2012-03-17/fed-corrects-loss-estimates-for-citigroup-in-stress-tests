The  Federal Reserve  corrected
errors in loan-loss estimates for financial firms including
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  in a stress test of capital during a hypothetical
economic slump.  The revised calculations don’t affect  capital ratios  that
determined whether the banks passed or failed, the Fed said in a
March 16 statement. In the test of Citigroup, an estimate for
losses on first-lien mortgages in a stressed scenario was
decreased by $400 million to $8.9 billion, while the estimate
for losses on “other loans” was increased by the same amount
to $4.8 billion.  The Fed required financial firms with more than $50 billion
in assets to submit capital plans that would demonstrate whether
the industry can withstand another crisis. U.S. banks deemed
strong enough, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., were cleared to
raise  dividends  and repurchase shares.  Citigroup was among four firms whose plans the Fed rejected
March 13 after the central bank estimated that, under the New
York-based lender’s proposal, it might fall short of
requirements in a stressed scenario.  The Fed also changed calculations for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , Ally Financial Inc.,  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  MetLife Inc. (MET)   The central bank, in some cases, reduced loss estimates for
first- and second-lien mortgages, and then specified that the
numbers it provided were for domestic loans only. Projected
losses on Citigroup’s home equity lines of credit, using that
methodology, declined $100 million to $5.9 billion.  International Real Estate  Losses on other loans, which include international real
estate, increased $100 million to $1.8 billion for Bank of
America. The loss rate on first-lien mortgages for Detroit-based
Ally, the largest U.S. auto lender, dropped to 6 percent from
6.1 percent.  The loss rate on other loans in a stressed scenario
declined to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent at  Bank of America ; 2.5
percent from 3 percent at Ally; 2.8 percent from 3.8 percent at
Citigroup; 1.6 percent from 2 percent at MetLife; and 2.1
percent from 2.2 percent at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo.  The rate of total loan losses at New York-based MetLife,
the biggest U.S. life insurer, fell to 1.4 percent from 1.6
percent.  Ally, MetLife and Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc. joined
Citigroup as the only firms out of 19 to fail part of the stress
tests by at least one capital measure, according to Fed data
released March 13. Citigroup, Ally and SunTrust have said they
will resubmit capital plans. MetLife is winding down its banking
business and has said it remains committed to returning funds to
shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
