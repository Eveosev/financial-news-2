Pennsylvania State University
football coach  Joe Paterno , who died 11 weeks after being fired
for his handling of a child-sex scandal, should have his name on
the school’s stadium, a Quinnipiac University poll found.  Pennsylvania voters support renaming Beaver Stadium as Joe
Paterno Stadium by 46 percent to 40 percent, according to the
poll released yesterday.  “There is lingering respect for Joe Paterno,” said Tim
Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling
Institute in Hamden,  Connecticut .  Paterno coached the Nittany Lions to 409 wins, a record at
college football’s highest level. The victories included two
national championships and a record 24 bowl victories in 46
seasons as head coach at one of college football’s most
prestigious programs.  He was fired Nov. 9 after being criticized for failing to
contact police when told of a case involving former defensive
coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who was charged with assaulting boys
in the school’s athletic complex. He died of  lung cancer  Jan.
22.  College football fans were in favor of renaming the stadium
55 percent to 37 percent, while non-fans were opposed 44 percent
to 37 percent, the poll found.  “One has to wonder: If the Sandusky scandal had never
happened whether support for renaming the stadium would have
approached 100 percent,” Malloy said.  The university surveyed 1,256 registered voters by
telephone from March 7-12. The margin of error was plus or minus
2.8 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
