Ed Balls, Treasury spokesman for
the U.K.’s opposition Labour Party, told the Times newspaper
 Gordon Brown  would never be seen as a “great prime minister.”  “I spent a lot of time with somebody for whom not being
the leader was the most important thing,” he said in a Times
magazine interview. “It’s unbelievably debilitating to your
life, to your relationships, to everything.”  Balls began working for the Labour Party in 1994 and spent
most of his time as principal adviser to Brown, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
