Saudi Arabian shares extended
gains, approaching their highest level since the start of the
financial crisis, and volume surged as better-than-expected U.S.
economic data underpinned global growth prospects.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 0.4 percent to 7,600.57,
its highest level since Sept. 14, 2008, at the 3:30 p.m. close
in  Riyadh . Some 759 million  shares  traded, compared with a six-
month daily average of 312 million. The 152-member index rallied
2.6 percent last week, an eighth consecutive gain the longest
streak since April 2005. The gauge is up 18.6 percent this year.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemicals maker, reached the highest since July.  Dar Al
Arkan Real Estate Development Co. (ALARKAN) , the kingdom’s second-biggest
developer by market value, soared the most in more than six
weeks.  “Data released in the U.S. in the past week gave
satisfaction to the market,” said Turki Fadaak, head of
research at Riyadh-based Albilad Investment Co. “Petrochemical
products also slightly rose, boosted by U.S. retail data.”  U.S. stocks gained last week after the central bank said on
March 13 that the economic outlook has improved as the labor
market strengthens. Claims for jobless benefits matched the
lowest level in four years, according to Labor Department data.
The  S&P 500  added 2.4 percent in the week, climbing to the
highest level since May 2008. It has rallied 10 out of 11 weeks
this year.  Retail sales in the U.S. rose in February by the most in
five months, a report on March 13 showed, reflecting broad-based
gains that indicate the world’s largest economy is picking up.  Crude oil for April delivery rose 1.9 percent to $107.06 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the
highest settlement since March 9. Saudi Arabia relied on oil
exports for 93 percent of its revenue in 2011.  Sabic gained 1 percent to 106.50 riyals, the highest since
July 25. Dar Al Arkan surged 7 percent to 12.20 riyals, the
biggest increase since Feb. 1.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
that opens on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
