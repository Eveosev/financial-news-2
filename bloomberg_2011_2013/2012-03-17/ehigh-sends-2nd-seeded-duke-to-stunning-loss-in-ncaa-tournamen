Lehigh University pulled off one of
the most shocking upsets in National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament history, defeating second-seeded  Duke
University  for the second win today by a 15th seed.  Lehigh (27-7), which had never before won an NCAA
tournament game, triumphed 75-70 against Duke, which has 96 NCAA
wins and four national championships, including 2010.  Until today, only four No. 2 seeds had lost their opening
game at the NCAA menâ€™s tournament since 1985. Then it happened
twice in less than three hours.  First, No. 15 Norfolk State beat No. 2 Missouri 86-84 in
the West Regional. Then Lehigh, from Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania ,
pulled off an even bigger surprise with its win against the Blue
Devils (27-7).  The Lehigh Mountain Hawks were 0-4 in the NCAA tournament
before today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
