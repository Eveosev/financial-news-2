SVG Capital Plc (SVI)  may face investor
opposition over plans to return only 15 percent of the firm’s
capital and its proposal to end an exclusive relationship with
buyout firm Permira Advisors LLP, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  Shareholder Jeremy Coller of Coller Capital Ltd. held talks
with  Schroders Plc (SDR)  on voting against the proposals at SVG’s
extraordinary general meeting this month, the newspaper said,
without saying  how it knows. SVG Chief Executive Lynn Fordham
told the newspaper she will move ahead with the company’s
planned strategy. Returning more than the proposed 170 million
pounds ($269.3 million) would mean “significant execution
risk” for SVG, she told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
