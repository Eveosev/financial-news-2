A “thin” one-kilometer (0.6 mile)
oil stain was identified in  Brazil ’s offshore Frade field, where
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  suspended production this week after a new sea-
floor seep, the country’s navy said.  The stain was found yesterday by a navy inspector flying
over the area in the Atlantic Ocean, the navy said in a
 statement  dated yesterday on its website.  The navy, Brazil’s oil regulator ANP and federal
environmental agency Ibama will monitor Chevron’s cleanup of the
stain, according to the statement.  Calls placed to the navy seeking further information went
unanswered, and a Chevron spokesman wasn’t immediately
available.  Chevron, which was stopped from exploring in the field
after a spill of as much as 3,000 barrels in the area in
November, requested authorization from ANP on March 15 to
suspend production there while it investigates a new sea-floor
seep.  The San Ramon, California-based company captured less than
five liters (1.3 gallons) from the seep, Rafael Williamson, a
director of corporate affairs at Chevron, said at a press
conference in  Rio de Janeiro  on the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
