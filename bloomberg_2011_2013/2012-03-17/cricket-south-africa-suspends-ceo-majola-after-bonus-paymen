Cricket South Africa  said it
suspended Chief Executive Officer Gerald Majola pending a
disciplinary hearing into bonuses.  The board of Cricket  South Africa  also appointed Willie
Basson as acting president, replacing AK Khan who quit on March
14, until its annual general meeting in September, the
Johannesburg-based organization, said in an e-mailed statement
today. The disciplinary hearing will consider the findings of an
inquiry appointed by Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula and headed
by retired judge Chris Nicholson, it said.  Nicholson recommended Majola repay a 1.75 million rand
($232,000) bonus that was not declared to the sport federation’s
remuneration committee, that he face disciplinary action and
that Cricket South Africa’s board be reorganized, the South
African Press Association said on March 9. Majola denied any
wrongdoing and said he declared the bonus to the board without
placing it in writing, SAPA said on March 13, citing Majola.  To contact the reporter on this story:
