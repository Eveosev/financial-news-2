Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice
Muamba is “critically ill” in a  London  hospital after
collapsing during today’s F.A. Cup soccer at Tottenham, the
Premier League club said in a statement.  Muamba, 23, collapsed near midfield about 41 minutes into
the first half at White Hart Lane in north London. He was
carried off the field on a stretcher and rushed to London Chest
Hospital.  “Bolton Wanderers can confirm that Fabrice Muamba has been
admitted to the heart attack centre at the London Chest Hospital
where he is currently in a critically ill condition in intensive
care,” the  club said , adding no further information will be
issued at this point.  Players and fans were visibly upset, with some in tears,
and referee  Howard Webb  took both teams off the field. Moments
later the game was abandoned with the score tied 1-1.  Muamba, a member of the England under-21 national team, is
in his fourth season with Bolton. He has appeared in 19 matches
this season, scoring once.  To contact the reporter on this story:
