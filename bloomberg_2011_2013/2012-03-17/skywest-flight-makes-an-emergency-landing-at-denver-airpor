A  SkyWest Inc. (SKYW)  flight with 52
passengers onboard was forced to return to  Denver International
Airport  and make an emergency landing today, an airport
spokeswoman said.  Flight 545X landed at 12:02 p.m. local time and the
passengers were evacuated by bus to the terminal, said Jenny
Schiavone, an airport spokeswoman.  “Denver fire continues to investigate, and they have
nothing thus far,” Schiavone said in a telephone interview.  She said she didn’t immediately have any further
information on what prompted the emergency or where the plane
was bound for.  To contact the reporter on this story:
