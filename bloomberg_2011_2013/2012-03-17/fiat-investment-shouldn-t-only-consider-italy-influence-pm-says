Fiat SpA (F)  has the “right and duty”
to pick investments, including their locations, without only
considering Italian influence, Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said
after meeting with Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne .  “The country may ask much but has to respect” decision-
makers, he told a Milan conference held by the employers’ lobby
in  Italy . Pushing labor markets nearer standards set in other
advanced nations may make Italy more attractive, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
