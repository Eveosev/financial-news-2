Amnesty International  urged  Sudan 
to release a detained teacher and member of Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement-North, Jalila Khamis Koko, saying she’s “at
risk of torture and other ill treatment.”  Koko was two days ago taken from her home by a group
belonging to Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service,
Amnesty International said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The SPLM-N, banned in Sudan, was the northern branch of
South Sudan’s ruling party before it became a separate group
following the south’s independence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
