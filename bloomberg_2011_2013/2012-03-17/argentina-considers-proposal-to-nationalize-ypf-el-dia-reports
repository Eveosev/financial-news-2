Argentina is considering sending a
proposal to the nation’s Congress to nationalize  YPF SA (YPFD) , the
nation’s largest oil producer, El Dia reported today on its
 website , citing unidentified people in the legislature.  Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has
asked Planning Minister Julio De Vido and Deputy Economy
Minister Axel Kicillof to develop proposals about the future of
YPF, according to El Dia.  This week, the Argentine provinces of Chubut and  Santa Cruz 
pulled four oilfield licenses from YPF, saying the company
hadn’t invested enough. YPF is 57 percent owned by Repsol,
Spain’s largest oil producer, while the Eskenazi family’s
Petersen Group controls 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
