The number of foreigners living in
the U.K. who can shelter overseas earnings from U.K. taxes fell
16 percent since the government required them to pay a levy of
30,000 pounds ($47,500) annually if they have been living here
for more than seven years, the Financial Times reported.  The number fell to 118,000 in 2009-2010, the newspaper
reported, citing data obtained by the Scottish commercial law
firm McGrigors LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
