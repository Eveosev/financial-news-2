Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-largest
oil company, will finish increasing its stake in Australia’s
Ichthys liquefied natural-gas venture by the end of the year,
later than planned.  The company was “a little too optimistic” when it said
Feb. 10 that the deal would be completed within weeks, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said today in
Beijing. He declined to comment on whether the transaction would
be finished in the first or the second half of 2012.  Total has 24 percent of Ichthys, while Japan’s  Inpex Corp. (1605) 
owns about 73 percent. The Paris-based company has no plans for
now to take a larger stake in Gladstone, another Australian LNG
project,  De Margerie  told reporters.  The company continues to “actively manage its asset
portfolio” and is selling off “non-strategic” assets, it said
Feb. 10. Total has said it expects output to increase this year
after a decline in 2011 and has pledged to take more risks in
looking for oil and gas.  Total has signed an agreement to take a 20 percent stake in
 China ’s Zhanjiang refinery project, De Margerie said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
