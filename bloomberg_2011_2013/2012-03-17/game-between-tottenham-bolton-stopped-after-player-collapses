The English F.A. Cup quarterfinal
match between Tottenham and Bolton was stopped late in the first
half tied 1-1 following the collapse of Bolton midfielder
Fabrice Muamba.  Muamba, 24, was attended to by medical staff of both teams
after collapsing on the field and was taken off on a stretcher.
Referee Howard Webb ordered both teams off the field and the
decision was made to abandon the game.  ESPN, which was broadcasting the game, said Muamba was
taken to the hospital.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
