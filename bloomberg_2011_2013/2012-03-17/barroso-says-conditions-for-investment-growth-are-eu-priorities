European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  said creating conditions for investment and taking steps
to boost growth and job creation are priorities.  “We have a monetary union in  Europe , but we don’t have yet
a true economic union,” he said at an event hosted in Milan by
Confindustria,  Italy ’s employers lobby. A culture of financial
stability is indispensable for a proper economic union, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
