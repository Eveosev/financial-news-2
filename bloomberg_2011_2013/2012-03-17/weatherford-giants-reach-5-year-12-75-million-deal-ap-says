Punter Steve Weatherford agreed to
a five-year contract worth $12.75 million with the  New York
Giants , the  Associated Press  reported, citing a person familiar
with the deal.  Weatherford, 29, will receive a $3.25 million signing
bonus, the person told the AP. The bonus exceeds the $2.6
million he would have earned if he had signed his franchise
tender with the National Football League team.  Weatherford recorded a career-best 39.2-yard net average
last season for the Giants, who beat the  New England Patriots  in
the Super Bowl championship game.  The San Diego Chargers yesterday cut backup quarterback
Billy Volek, who led the team to an American Football Conference
divisional playoff win in 2007 when Philip Rivers was injured in
the fourth quarter.  Volek, 35, who has been in the NFL for 13 years, appeared
in 15 games during his tenure with the Chargers from 2006-11.  When he stepped in to relieve Rivers in the AFC playoff
game, he directed the team to an eight-play, 78-yard touchdown
drive for a 28-24 victory over the  Indianapolis Colts .  To contact the reporter on this story:
