Bolton Wanderers midfield Fabrice
Muamba was taken to a  London  hospital today after collapsing on
the field just before halftime of an English F.A. Cup
quarterfinal match at Tottenham.  Muamba, 23, went down near midfield about 41 minute into
the first half of the 1-1 game at White Hart Lane in north
London. Team medical staff and paramedics raced onto the field
and started tending to Muamba, who was wearing an oxygen mask as
he was stretchered off following a lengthy delay.  In a  statement , Bolton said Muamba had been taken to the
hospital and no further information was immediately available.  Players on the field were visibly upset and referee  Howard Webb  took both sides off the field. ESPN, which was broadcasting
the game, said Webb spoke with Bolton manager Owen Coyle and his
Tottenham counterpart  Harry Redknapp  and the decision was made
to abandon the match.  Muamba, a member of the England under-21 national team, is
in his fourth season with Bolton. He’s appeared in 19 matches
this season, scoring once.  To contact the reporter on this story:
