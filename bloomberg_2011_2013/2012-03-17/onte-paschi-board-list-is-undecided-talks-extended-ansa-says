Fondazione Monte Paschi failed to
decide on a list of  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  board
candidates and will keep talking tomorrow, Ansa said.  Fondazione has the right to name half the board and plans
to propose former UniCredit SpA Chief Executive Officer
 Alessandro Profumo  as chairman, Ansa said without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
