A proposal put forward by private-
equity firm OpCapita to rescue  Game Group Plc (GMG)  may break down,
the Guardian newspaper reported.  The computer-game retailer, which owes its lenders more
than 100 million pounds ($158.4 million), needs new investors so
it can pay its rent bill this month and avoid job cuts,
according to the report, which cited people it didn’t identify.
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , which is owed 45 million
pounds, said it’s still in discussions with all parties
involving Game Group, the report said, citing a bank spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
