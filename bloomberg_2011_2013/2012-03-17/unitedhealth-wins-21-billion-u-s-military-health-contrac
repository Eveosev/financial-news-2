UnitedHealth (UNH)  Group Inc. wrested a
military health contract valued at as much as $20.5 billion from
 TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corp. (1893Q) , a closely held company that
has had the work since 2003.  UnitedHealth, the nation’s biggest health insurer by
revenue, in April persuaded the Pentagon to reconsider a 2009
decision to award the five-year contract for the western region
to TriWest. The U.S. Defense Department announced the decision
in favor of UnitedHealth after markets closed yesterday, sending
the company’s shares higher in after-market trading.  The win gives UnitedHealth, based in Minnetonka,  Minnesota ,
access to the military health-care market, which the company has
aggressively pursued. In June, it lost a separate challenge for
a $23.5 billion contract for the South region, covered by
Louisville, Kentucky-based  Humana Inc. (HUM)   “It’s a huge strategic win for them because they’re not in
the military space,”  Ana Gupte , an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. in  New York , said before the announcement. “It
just extends the reach of United into every part of health
benefits in the  United States .”  TriWest, Humana and Woodland Hills, California-based
 HealthNet Inc. (HNT)  are the main managed-care providers for Tricare,
the military’s health-care program.  UnitedHealth shares rose as much as 3.8 percent in after-
market trading yesterday to $57.69. Before yesterday’s
announcement, the shares had risen 9.7 percent this year.  Matt Stearns, a UnitedHealth spokesman, declined to
comment. The company had $102 billion in revenue last year.  ‘Primary’ Business  The award comes after TriWest agreed to pay a $10 million
fine in September to settle a federal whistleblower lawsuit. The
suit, filed in U.S. District Court in  San Francisco  by four
former employees, accused the company of submitting claims to
the government without including discounts negotiated with
service providers.  TriWest currently is serving the western region under the
2003 contract. The loss of the new contract, which begins April
1, 2013, essentially would erase much of TriWest’s revenue
stream.  “This is our primary line of business,” Scott Celley, a
TriWest spokesman, said yesterday in a telephone interview
before the announcement. “We have a few other things that
support military families, but this is essentially all that we
do.”  The company hasn’t decided whether it will appeal the
decision, Celley said.  TriWest won its first Tricare contract in 1996 for the
western region. The Phoenix-based company has about 1,800
employees and serves 2.9 million active-duty military, retirees
and their families in 21 states.  “We are extremely disappointed that the  Department of
Defense  chose to reverse their decision,” David McIntyre Jr.,
TriWest’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “For
the past 16 years, we have worked tirelessly and with the
highest levels of respect to meet the health-care needs of West
Region military families who have very much become our family.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
