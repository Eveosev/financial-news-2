Lehigh University and Norfolk State
University, the 15th-seeded schools that stunned their higher-
ranked opponents, will be among the 16 teams trying to advance
to the regional semifinals of the men’s national college
basketball tournament.  Lehigh, which beat Duke, faces No. 10 Xavier in Greensboro,
 North Carolina , today and Norfolk State, winner over  Missouri ,
takes on seventh-seeded Florida in Omaha,  Nebraska , in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association contest.  “We messed up some brackets! We messed up some brackets!”
said Norfolk senior Kyle O’Quinn. “We even messed up my
bracket.”  In other games, No. 1 Michigan State plays ninth-seeded
Saint Louis and No. 11 North Carolina State challenges third-
seeded Georgetown in Columbus, Ohio; No. 6 Cincinnati meets
third-seeded Florida State and No. 12  South Florida  takes on No.

Purdue play in Omaha.  Yesterday top-seeded  Syracuse University  defeated Kansas
State University 75-59 and No. 1 University of  Kentucky  topped
 Iowa State University  87-71 in the third round of the men’s
national college basketball tournament.  Winning Streak  In other tournament games yesterday, No. 2  Ohio State

points for Kentucky (34-2) in the South Region.  The Wildcats visit Atlanta on March 23 to take on  Indiana 
in the next round.  Royce White had 23 points for the Cyclones (23-11) and
 Chris Allen  contributed 16.  “We’ve got nothing to hang our head about. We got beat by
the No. 1 overall seed that played an incredible game,”
Cyclones coach Fred Hoiberg told reporters.  Tie Breaker  At the Rose Garden in  Portland ,  Oregon , Will Sheehey hit a
15-foot jumper with 11 seconds left to break a 61-61 tie and
give the Hoosiers (27-8) their win. Christian Watford had 16
points and Cody Zeller had 16 points and 13 rebounds.  Virginia Commonwealth (29-7) had a 61-56 lead on Darius
Theus’s basket with two minutes, 24 seconds left, the last time
the Rams would score in the game. Zeller added two free throws,
while Victor Oladipo was fouled on his layup to contribute three
and tie the game with 46 seconds left.  “At that time I thought the momentum was on our side. We
had made a little comeback there,” Sheehey said. “And I’m
comfortable shooting at that range. It was pretty open, so I
decided to take it.”  Bradford Burgess led the Rams with 15 points, and Rob
Brandenburg, who missed the winning 3-pointer with two seconds
left in the game, had 13 points.  ‘Killed on Boards’  Dion Waiters scored 18 points and Scoop Jardine added 16 to
lead Syracuse (33-2) in the East Regional game at Consol Energy
Center in Pittsburgh. The Orange will play  Wisconsin  as they
advance for the third straight year into the regional semifinals
being played in  Boston  on March 22.  “The second half, we made shots. We haven’t done that
lately,” said Orange coach Jim Boeheim. “Our offense was not
good in the first half. We had to pick it up on the offensive
end. We got killed on the boards. Second half, we did a much
better job on the boards.”  Rodney McGruder scored 15 points and Jordan Henriguez had
14 points for eighth-seeded Kansas State (22-11).  In the other East Regional game, Jared Sullinger and
Deshaun Thomas scored 18 points each and Aaron Kraft came off
the bench to add 17 for the Buckeyes, who are going into the
regional semifinals for the third straight time.  Ohio State (29-7) will meet No. 6 Cincinnati or third-
seeded  Florida  State in the next round in Boston.  Sullinger Seals Win  The Bulldogs, who were down by 10 points, rallied to tie
the score at 61-61 on a 3-point basket by Elias Harris, who had
16 points, with four minutes, five seconds left to play.
Sullinger’s two jumpers and two foul shots in the final minutes
helped seal the victory for the Buckeyes.  In a West Regional contest, Darius Johnson-Odom and reserve
Jae Crowder each added 17 points for the Marquette Golden Eagles
(27-7) at KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Kentucky.  Marquette reached its second consecutive regional semifinal
against Florida or Norfolk State in Phoenix.  Murray State was led by Isaiah Canaan with 16 points and
reserve Jewuan Long with 12 points. After an aggressive first
half in which they had a 28-25 halftime advantage, the Racers
shot 26 percent in the second half and had only two field goals
over the final 7 minutes 43 seconds.  “I told them in the locker room that I just -- I wish I
could have figured out a way to get them through the last seven
minutes,” Racers coach Steve Prohm said. “We just didn’t
finish some plays on the offensive end that we had to do in
order to withstand some of their run-outs and some of their
execution, and we didn’t.”  Murray State  Murray State lost its bid to become the first team ever
from the  Ohio  Valley Conference to win two games in the NCAA
tournament.  In an East Regional game at University Arena in
 Albuquerque , New Mexico, Jordan Taylor scored 14 points and
Jared Berggren added 12 points for Wisconsin (26-9). Festus
Ezeli had 14 points and 11 rebounds and  John Jenkins  had 13
points for Vanderbilt (25-11).  Following Wisconsin’s win, Brady Heslip scored 27 points
for Baylor (29-7), while Askia Booker came off the bench to lead
Colorado (24-12).  Baylor will play Xavier or Lehigh in the regional
semifinals in Atlanta in the South Region.  At the Rose Garden in Portland, Russ Smith came off the
bench to lead Louisville (28-9) with 17 points. Drew Gordon had
21 points and 14 rebounds for New Mexico (28-7).  Louisville will play Michigan State or Saint Louis of the
