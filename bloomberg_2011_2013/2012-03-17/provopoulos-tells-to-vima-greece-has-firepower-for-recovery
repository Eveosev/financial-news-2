George Provopoulos , the head of
 Greece ’s central bank and a member of the European Central Bank
Governing Council, said there is strong “firepower” to restart
the  Greek economy ,  To Vima  reported, citing an interview.  Provopoulos said an improved climate after the completion
of the country’s debt swap may cause as much as 15 billion euros
($19.8 billion) to return to Greek banks, while the country’s
privatization plan may generate as much as 50 billion euros in
the years to come, To Vima reported in a preview of a story that
will appear in tomorrow’s edition.  Provopoulos told the Athens-based newspaper that Greece’s
debt may fall to 116.5 percent of gross domestic product by
2020.  “The latest, most accurate estimates show a debt reduction
to 116.5 percent of GDP by 2020,” Provopoulos was quoted as
saying. “I don’t believe this target is too optimistic, to the
contrary, I believe we can do better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
