Everton and Sunderland tied 1-1 to
force a replay of their English F.A. Cup soccer quarterfinal.  Phil Bardsley gave Sunderland a 12th-minute lead at
Everton’s Goodison Park and  Tim Cahill  scored with a header 11
minutes later. Everton’s Royston Drenthe hit the post with a
free kick and Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet made
consecutive saves against  John Heitinga  and Nikica Jelavic with
five minutes remaining.  Today’s second quarterfinal between Tottenham and Bolton in
London was abandoned just before halftime with the score tied 1-
1 after Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba, 23, collapsed on the
field.  The quarterfinal round continues tomorrow as Chelsea hosts
Leicester and Stoke visits Liverpool.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
