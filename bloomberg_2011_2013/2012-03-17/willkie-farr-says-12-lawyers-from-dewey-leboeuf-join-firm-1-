Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP said
12 insurance and regulatory lawyers have joined the  law firm 
after leaving Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, including partners Alexander Dye, Michael Groll, Robert Rachofsky and John Schwolsky.  Some of the attorneys will work in Willkie Farr’s New York
office, while others will be in  London . Christopher Petito will
work in Washington, the law firm said in a statement.  The 12 lawyers represented insurance companies on mergers
and acquisitions as well as on stock and bond offerings, the New
York Times reported. The newspaper said 31 of 300 partners have
left New York-based Dewey since January, and many had their pay
deferred or cut after  Dewey (1151L)  posted weak financial results last
year.  Willkie Farr (1179L) , also based in  New York , provides legal and
business advice through about 600 attorneys and other staff from
eight offices in the U.S. and  Europe , according to the law
firm’s website.  Dewey spokesman Angelo Kakolyris and Willkie spokeswoman
Antoinette McGovern didn’t immediately respond to voicemail and
e-mail messages sent by Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
