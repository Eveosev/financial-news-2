U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  will scrap the 50 percent top rate of income tax
in the coming budget, the Financial Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Osborne may cut the rate to 45 percent, while curbing tax
allowances and relief that some high earners use to reduce their
total payments, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
