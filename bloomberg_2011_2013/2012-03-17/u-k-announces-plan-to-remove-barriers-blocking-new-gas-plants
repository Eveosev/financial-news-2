The British government will
announce plans to protect investment in new gas-fired  power
plants  later this year as the country seeks to lock in energy
supplies when old stations close.  “Gas will continue to play a vital role in a low-carbon
economy,” Energy and Climate Change Secretary Edward Davey said
today. “A fifth of the U.K.’s aging fleet of power stations
will close this decade and it’s not possible to fill that gap
entirely with low-carbon alternatives in that timescale.”  About 10,000 megawatts of coal-fired plants are due to
close by 2015 because of European Union emissions laws. The
retirement of nuclear plants toward the end of the decade is
also boosting the need for new generation. At present, reliable
generation capacity exceeds peak demand by 32 percent,  Centrica
Plc (CNA)  managing director Mark Hanafin said in February.  Plans for a capacity market, which would reward companies
for running gas plants to back up intermittent wind generation,
will ensure that companies invest in baseload power, Davey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
