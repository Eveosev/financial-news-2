U.K gilts declined, with 10-year
yields posting the biggest weekly increase in more than three
years, as investors raised their inflation expectations amid
signs the global economic recovery is gathering momentum.  Ten-year  yields  climbed to the highest since October. The
 Federal Reserve  raised its outlook for the  U.S. economy  this
week and speculation mounted the euro-area sovereign debt crisis
is easing, prompting traders to reduce bets on more asset
purchases, or quantitative easing, by the  Bank of England  and
the Fed.  Fitch Ratings  said that the U.K. risks losing its AAA
status. The pound rose against all 16 of its major peers.  “There’s fading hopes that the Fed is going to do another
round of QE, which triggered the initial sell-off in the U.S.,
and German and U.K. bonds are catching up,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd., a broker for banks. “The Fitch announcement came as a bit
of a surprise and added to the negative sentiment” for gilts,
he said.  The 10-year gilt yield rose 29 basis points in the week, or
0.29 percentage point, to 2.45 percent as of 4:17 p.m. London
time yesterday. That was the biggest weekly gain since advancing
by 39 basis points in the five days through Jan. 23, 2009. The
yield reached 2.49 percent, the highest since Oct. 31. The 4
percent bond due March 2022 fell 2.83, or 28.30 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,583) face amount, to 113.68.  Sterling Strengthens  The 30-year yield jumped 26 basis points to 3.48 percent,
after breaching 3.50 percent for the first time since October.
Yields on the benchmark German bund climbed 26 basis points this
week to 2.05 percent, while the Treasury 10-year rate was 28
basis points higher at 2.31 percent.  The pound snapped two weeks of losses against the dollar,
rising 1 percent to $1.5827, and strengthened 0.6 percent to
83.21 pence per euro.  Gilts may extend their slide next week amid speculation
that a government report will show inflation stayed above the
central bank’s 2 percent target last month.  Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent from a year earlier after
a 3.6 percent gain in January, the  Office for National
Statistics  will say on March 20, according to the median
prediction of 36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Bank of
England is scheduled to release the minutes of its latest policy
meeting a day later.  The cost of living in the U.S. rose in February by the most
in 10 months, the Labor Department said in  Washington  yesterday.
The consumer-price index climbed 0.4 percent, after increasing
0.2 percent the prior month. Quicker inflation erodes the
purchasing power of the fixed payments from bonds.  Breakeven Rate  The U.K. 10-year  break-even rate , a measure of expectations
of inflation derived from a difference in yield between regular
and index-linked bonds, widened 12 basis points this week to
2.79 percentage points. It reached 2.81 percentage points on
March 15, the most since Oct. 11.  The extra yield that investors get for holding 30-year
gilts instead of the two-year securities widened to more than
300 basis points yesterday for the first time since Sept. 29,
based on closing levels.  U.K. bonds handed investors a loss of 2.8 percent this year
through March 15, after returning 17 percent in 2011, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Treasuries lost 1.7 percent in
2012, with German debt falling 0.8 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
