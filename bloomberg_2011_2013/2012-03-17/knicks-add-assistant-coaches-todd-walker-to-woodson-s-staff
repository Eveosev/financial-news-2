New York  Knicks interim coach Mike Woodson added assistant coaches Jim Todd and Darrell Walker to
his staff.  Woodson replaced assistant coaches Dan D’Antoni and Phil Weber who left when coach Mike D’Antoni resigned this week after
the Knicks lost six straight games. Woodson won his first two
contests as coach.  Todd comes to New York from the  Sacramento Kings  where he
was an assistant coach this season. He was Woodson’s assistant
with the Atlanta Hawks from 2008-10, and coached in China from
2010-11.  Todd and Woodson both served as assistants under coach
Chris Ford in Milwaukee from 1996-98.  Walker, a former Knicks player, was an assistant coach with
the  Detroit Pistons  from 2007-10. He also worked with the New
Orleans Hornets and the Toronto Raptors where he was promoted to
head coach in 1996-97 and compiled a 41-90 record over two
seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
