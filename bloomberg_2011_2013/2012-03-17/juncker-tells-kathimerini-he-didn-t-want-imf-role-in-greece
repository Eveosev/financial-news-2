Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-
Claude Juncker, who heads the group of euro-area finance
ministers, said Germany and the Netherlands wanted the
 International Monetary Fund  to provide financial support to
 Greece , Kathimerini reported, citing an interview.  “I was among those who didn’t want the IMF’s
involvement,” Juncker told the Athens-based newspaper in a
preview of a story to be published in tomorrow’s editions. “The
Dutch and German parliaments would be very reluctant to provide
Greece with assistance if there were no support from the IMF,”
he said.  Juncker also said Greece’s partners insisted primarily on
fiscal consolidation and didn’t put enough emphasis on promoting
the nation’s growth, Kathimerini reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
