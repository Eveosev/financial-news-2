A Latvian journalist was shot
yesterday in the stairwell of his Riga apartment building by two
assailants, Andrejs Sozinovs, chief of the capital’s criminal
police, said in an  interview  with Latvijas Radio.  Leonids Jakobsons, a journalist for the Kompromat.lv
website, a Russian-language portal that published what it said
were private e-mails from political figures, is recovering in
hospital, according to Sozinovs.  “He’s stable and we hope today we can talk to him in
detail about what happened,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
