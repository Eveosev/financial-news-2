Mexico ’s  benchmark stock  index
rose, extending the biggest weekly advance since December, after
central bank minutes published today showed policy makers are
considering cutting  interest rates .  The IPC index of 35 companies rose 1 percent to 39,521.24
at the close of trading, setting a record high and boosting the
weekly rally to 3.1 percent. MSCI Inc.’s  Latin America (MXLA)  index
rose 0.5 percent.  “There’s been a significant change in the market’s view”
of central bank policy, said Luis Rodriguez, director of
research at Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB in Guadalajara, Mexico.  Most of the central bank board’s members said a rate
reduction may be warranted to bolster the economy should
inflation remain tame, according to the minutes from the March
16 meeting in which they held benchmark borrowing costs at a
record low 4.5 percent.  Alberto Ramos , an economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
wrote in a note to clients that the minutes were “more dovish
than expected.”  Kimberly-Clark de Mexico SAB , Mexico’s biggest consumer
products company, led gains on the day, advancing 6.4 percent.
 Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB (FEMSAUBD) , the company that controls Latin
America’s largest Coca-Cola bottler, soared 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
