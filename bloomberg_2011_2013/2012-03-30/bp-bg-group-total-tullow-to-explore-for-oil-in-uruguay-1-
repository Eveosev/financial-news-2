BP Plc (BP/) ,  BG Group Plc (BG/) ,  Total SA (FP)  and
 Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  won bids to explore for offshore deposits in
Uruguay, the country’s state oil company Ancap said.  The four companies will invest $1.56 billion in three years
of exploration in the country, Raul Sendic, the head of Ancap,
told reporters in Montevideo. The companies were selected from a
total of 19 bidders,  Ancap  said in a separate statement today.  Uruguay is betting that the companies may discover offshore
 oil deposits  similar to those that have been identified in
neighbor Brazil’s  Santos Basin .  YPF SA (YPFD) ,  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) 
and  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP)  won a first round of bids in Feb. 2010.  Ancap will hold a minority stake in each of the concessions
that will expire in 30 years, the company said. Early
exploratory work must be completed within a 3-year period.  BP will invest $532 million in exploration on the three
blocks it won, Sendic said. BG will invest $672 million and
Total will spend $344 million and is the only company that will
drill a well in the first three years, Sendic said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
