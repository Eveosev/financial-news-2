A merger of  Snam SpA (SRG)  with Italian
power-grid operator  Terna Rete Elettrica Nazionale SpA (TRN)  would not
create “synergies,” Eni Chairman Giuseppe Recchi said.  “I don’t think that a merger of Snam and Terna would be
the best way to create synergies, even if it’s up to the
government to decide,” Recchi told reporters today at a
conference in Cernobbio, Italy.  Recchi added that advisers have not yet been appointed on
the sale of Eni’s stake in gas transporter Snam, as Eni is
awaiting the government’s expected decree on the separation. The
Italian government is seeking to improve competition in the
energy industry by having Eni sell Snam by September 2013.  Eni, Italy’s largest oil company, owns 50.03 percent of
Snam, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
