Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) , the
world’s No. 2 computer memory-chip maker, has been asked by
South Korea’s stock exchange to comment on a report it submitted
a bid for  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , according to a regulatory filing.  Hynix has until noon on April 2 to reply. Hynix submitted a
bid today to participate in the sale of Elpida, Yonhap Infomax
reported. Hynix dropped 3.9 percent to 29,300 won as of 2:16
p.m. in Seoul trading, while the benchmark Kospi index was
little changed.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the world’s second-largest maker of  flash
memory , also may invest in Elpida, the Japanese chipmaker that
filed for bankruptcy protection last month, a senior Toshiba
executive said. Toshiba may decide today whether to make a non-
binding bid and could invest in Elpida either alone or as part
of a group, said the executive, who declined to be identified
because the discussions are private.  Elpida filed for  bankruptcy  with liabilities of 448 billion
yen ($5.5 billion) on Feb. 27, after falling prices and a
stronger yen exacerbated the Tokyo-based company’s troubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
