Morocco , North Africa’s third-
largest wheat importer, is distributing barley for livestock
after crops were damaged by dry weather.  The backup plan to preserve livestock started two weeks
ago, and “other measures can be planned and programmed
depending on how the situation develops,” the  Agriculture
Ministry  in Rabat said in an e-mailed response to questions.
Crop damage will be assessed when the season ends, it said.  Jamal Hakimi, who cultivates about 100 hectares (247 acres)
of wheat and potatoes in Berrechid in central Morocco, said his
crops were destroyed.  “This year is exceptional because it’s the worst drought
since 1981,” he said. “The price of barley has tripled. There
is no other solution than to import more.”  Morocco may import the most wheat in at least a half
century in the 12 months beginning in July after rain delayed
planting and cold curbed crop development, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture’s  Foreign Agricultural Service  said in a report
this month. The nation may buy 5.6 million metric tons, from 3.2
million tons a year earlier, the service said. Barley imports
will jump to 1 million tons, from 510,000 tons, as output slumps
to 900,000 tons from 2.34 million tons, the FAS said.  Rainfall this season through this month is the lowest since
2006-07, according to the ministry. Egypt and  Algeria  are North
Africa’s largest wheat importers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
