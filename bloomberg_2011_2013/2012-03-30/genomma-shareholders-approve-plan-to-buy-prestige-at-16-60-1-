Genomma Lab Internacional SAB (LABB) , the
Mexican producer of over-the-counter drugs, said shareholders
approved its unsolicited bid to buy  Prestige Brands Holdings
Inc. (PBH)  for $16.60 a share.  Genomma is seeking to buy Prestige shares “directly or
indirectly,” according to the statement today to the Mexican
stock exchange.  Prestige, the maker of Comet household cleaner and Clear
Eyes eye drops, turned down Genomma’s offer on March 12, saying
the $834 million value the Mexico City-based company established
wasn’t sufficient. The Mexican stock had slumped 20 percent from
Feb. 17, the last trading day before Genomma announced its plan
to buy Prestige, through yesterday.  While Prestige has been trading above the offer price,
Genomma’s Chief Financial Officer Oscar Villalobos said March 14
that his company has no intention “at this moment” to raise
its bid.  Prestige shares fell 0.5 percent to $17.65 at 10:20 a.m.
New York time. Genomma rose 1.1 percent to 23.28 pesos.  Villalobos declined at the time to say whether Genomma
would take its offer directly to shareholders of Irvington, New
York-based Prestige.  To contact the reporter on this story:
