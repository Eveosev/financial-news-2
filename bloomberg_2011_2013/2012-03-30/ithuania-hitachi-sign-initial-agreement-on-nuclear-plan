Lithuania signed an initial
concession agreement with  Japan ’s  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  for the building
of a nuclear power plant.  The accord, which enables Hitachi to proceed with
engineering and preparation work, was signed in Vilnius today,
the government press office said in an e-mailed statement.
Parliament must approve it before a final agreement is signed,
probably before June 28.  Lithuania wants to build the plant, with partners in
Estonia and Latvia, to reduce the region’s dependence on energy
imports from Russia. Lithuania imports 62 percent of its
electricity after closing the Soviet-built Ignalina nuclear
plant in 2009 to comply with European Union rules.  The new reactor is likely to start operating between 2020
and 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
