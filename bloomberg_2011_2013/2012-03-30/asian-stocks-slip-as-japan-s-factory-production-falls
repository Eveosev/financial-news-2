Most Asian  stocks  rose as the
region’s benchmark equity index headed toward its biggest
quarterly gain since 2010. Japanese manufacturers slid after the
nation’s industrial production unexpectedly fell and investors
waited for U.S. data on income and spending.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world’s
most profitable lender, climbed 1.6 percent after posting
earnings that exceeded estimates.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) ,  Japan ’s biggest
maker of factory robots, fell 2.9 percent.  Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd. (16) , the world No. 2 real estate company, plunged 13
percent in Hong Kong after the firm’s co-chairmen were arrested
in a corruption probe.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.2 percent to 126.81
as of 7:56 p.m. in  Tokyo , with five stocks rising for every four
that fell. The gauge is headed for its first monthly drop since
November, paring the biggest quarterly gain since the period
through September 2010. The measure has risen 11 percent this
year, gaining 0.3 percent on the week.  “You just don’t have sustainability for the markets to
reweight higher like they did three or four months ago,” Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the Asia-
Pacific region at Russell Investment Group, which manages about
$150 billion. “You are not going to see any acceleration from
here and you may actually feel a bit of moderation” in the U.S.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11 percent this year
through yesterday as improving economic reports from the U.S.
and progress on tackling  Europe ’s debt crisis boosted the
outlook for the region’s exporters. The U.S.  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPXL1)  has risen 12 percent and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
has advanced 6.6 percent advance.  Hong Kong Developers  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.3 percent, with a gauge
of property companies contributing most to the declines after
the arrest of Sun Hung Kai’s co-chairmen, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 0.5 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX
200 lost 0.1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index closed little
changed.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.3 percent after the
government reported the nation’s industrial production slid 1.2
percent in February from a month before. The median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a 1.3 percent
increase. Fanuc lost 2.9 percent to 14,680 yen.  Earnings Reports  Industrial & Commercial Bank of  China  added 1.6 percent to
HK$5.01 after reporting a 17 percent increase in net income to
44.4 billion yuan ($7 billion) as income from loans and fee-
based financial services outpaced a rise in defaults.  In Taipei, Quanta Computer Inc., the world’s largest laptop
maker by shipments, added 6.9 percent to NT$77.30 after
reporting fourth-quarter net income of NT$6.53 billion ($221
million). The result was higher than the NT$5.52 billion average
of 14 analyst estimates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Of 691 companies listed on the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index that
have reported quarterly profit since Jan. 9, 57 percent have
missed analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.41 times per
book value, compared with 2.19 times for the  S&P 500  and 1.44
times for the Stoxx 600.  Futures on the S&P 500 advanced 0.5 percent today after the
index lost 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday. U.S. household
income rose 0.4 percent and  consumer spending  climbed 0.6
percent in February, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News forecast ahead of today’s reports.  Sun Hung Kai  Hong Kong  developers fell after anti-graft investigators
arrested Thomas and  Raymond Kwok  of Sun Hung Kai Properties in
one of the former British colony’s highest-profile corruption
cases in decades. Rafael Hui, a former No. 2 official in the
government, was also arrested, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because
of the ongoing probe.  “The arrests will have a negative short term impact on
sentiment but it’s not going to have an impact on the operation
of the company,” said  Pauline Dan , Hong Kong-based chief
investment officer at Samsung Investment Trust, which oversees
the equivalent of $72.1 billion in assets. “If the share price
gets down to a low enough level there will some bargain hunting
interest in the stock.”  Sun Hung Kai slumped 13 percent to HK$96.50, the lowest
since December. Henderson Land Development Company Ltd. fell 2.5
percent to HK$42.85, and Sino Land Company Ltd. declined 3.6
percent to HK$12.40.  Trading volume of Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  was 20
percent above the 30-day average today. A gauge of the measure’s
volatility fell 1 percent to 19.98, indicating traders expect a
swing of 5.7 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30
days. Volatility measures for Korea’s  Kospi 200 Index (VKOSPI)  and
Japan’s Nikkei 225 average also fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
