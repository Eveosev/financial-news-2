Granting  London  Metal Exchange
membership to a  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  unit would spur trading
activity from customers in the Asian country, according to the
head of the subsidiary.  Following are comments on LME membership from Arthur Fan,
chief executive officer of BOCI Global Commodities (U.K.) Ltd.,
which applied this week for LME membership. Fan spoke yesterday
by phone from London. BOCI Global Commodities is a unit of Bank
of China’s BOC International Holdings Ltd. arm.  Chinese customers account for more than 50 percent of LME
trading, Fan said.  “We expect to bring positive impact on both Chinese
customers and LME. There will be more volume.  “Once we become a member of the LME, we will be able to
provide a complete hedging solution to the Chinese customers.
Our parent company already has a very close business
relationship with Chinese natural-resources customers. There is
a huge demand for commodities in  China .  “It is a natural development for Chinese investment
banks or brokers to establish an LME business. Chinese
investment banks are really trying to catch up and grow
aggressively in the past few years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
