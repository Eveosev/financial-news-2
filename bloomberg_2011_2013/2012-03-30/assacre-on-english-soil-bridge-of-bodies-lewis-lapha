As  England ’s royal claimants fought
for the throne during the War of the Roses, the battles became
larger and fiercer. Henry VI, of the House of Lancaster, ruled
as king, but his weakness and bouts of schizophrenia emboldened
his challenger, Edward IV of the House of York.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The two forces, totaling 75,000 men, met on Palm Sunday in
1461 at Towton, a village near York. In the ensuing battle,
28,000 died --- the bloodiest day on British soil.  When the Lancastrian line broke, surrendering meant certain
death. There was little chance of escape and no prisoners would
be taken. The Yorkist cavalry used their horseman’s hammers on
the heads and backs of fleeing men. Some made it as far as a
nearby river where the existing crossing had been destroyed. But
so many died there that a “Bridge of Bodies” formed, which
their desperate comrades tried to struggle over.  Those who did escape fared no better: The Earl of Wiltshire
was later captured, decapitated in Edward’s presence and his
head sent south to be impaled on  London Bridge .  I spoke with George Goodwin, author of “Fatal Colours:
Towton 1461 - England’s Most Brutal Battle,” on the following
topics:  1. Warrior-King  2. Feeble Henry VI  3. Power Vacuum  4. York vs. Lancaster  5. Massacre  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
