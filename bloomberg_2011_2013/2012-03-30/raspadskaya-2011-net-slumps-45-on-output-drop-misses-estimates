OAO Raspadskaya (RASP) , a Russian coking
coal producer partly owned by billionaire  Roman Abramovich , said
profit dropped 45 percent last year as output shrank after
delays in restoring its main mine following a 2010 explosion.  Net income fell to $135 million from $245 million a year
earlier, Raspadskaya said today in an e-mailed statement. That
missed an average estimate of $201.8 million from 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Adjusted earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell about 4 percent to $324 million. Revenue
climbed 2.9 percent to $726 million.  Coal output fell 13 percent to 6.25 million metric tons,
Raspadskaya said in January, below the 6.4 million-ton estimate
the company gave in December. The decline was partly due to
delays in safety approvals as  Raspadskaya (RASP)  restores output at its
main mine following the blast in 2010 that killed 90 people.  A design project for a new face at the Raspadskaya mine,
#4-9-23, received approvals and mining is expected to start
there in the middle of April, Chief Executive Officer Gennady
Kozovoy said in the statement.  The drop in production is the main reason for the weaker
performance, Dmitry Smolin, an analyst at Uralsib Capital, said
before the results were reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
