Canadian natural gas for May
delivery rose as prices at the lowest in more than a decade
boosted buying from utilities and other big users.  Alberta  gas rose 1.2 percent after touching the lowest
level in 12 years yesterday. The U.S. Energy Department reported
 stockpiles  of the fuel were 59 percent above the five-year
average in the week ended March 23.  “The market has had a big breakdown,” said Carl Neill, a
consultant with Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “We’re
starting to get some buyer interest.”  Alberta gas for May delivery advanced 2 cents to C$1.68 a
gigajoule ($1.59 per million British thermal units) as of 3:40
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. April gas
slipped 1 cent to C$1.61 a gigajoule. It has declined 11 percent
this week.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 41 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 2.3 cents to settle at $2.126 per million Btu.
Nymex gas has dropped 29 percent this year.  Canadian gas for prompt delivery in the Midwest tumbled
amid milder-than-normal weather across the U.S. and lower
weekend industrial needs. U.S. heating demand will trail normal
by 27 percent through April 6, according to Belton, Missouri-
based forecaster Weather Derivatives.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
tumbled 10.22 cents, or 5 percent, to $1.9316 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western  Canada .  Spot prices in the Northwest gained amid forecasts of
colder-than-normal weather. Portland,  Oregon , may have a low of
38 degrees Fahrenheit (3 Celsius) tomorrow, 4 below normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 6.19 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $1.9195 per
million Btu. At Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, gas gained 4.79 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
$1.9672.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.9 billion cubic
feet, 93 million above target.  Gas Flows  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.88 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.2 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 1 billion cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.65 billion cubic feet today, or 62 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.08
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
