Weekly bookings of the largest  oil
tankers  to load cargoes of Persian Gulf crude reached this
year’s highest level, according to Marex Spectron Group.  Forty-one very large crude carriers were hired so far this
week, exceeding the prior high of 39 in the week before  China ’s
Lunar New Year holiday, Kevin Sy, a Singapore-based freight-
derivatives broker at Marex Spectron, said in an e-mailed report
today. The last business day before the week-long holiday was
Jan. 20.  VLCCs on the industry’s benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan
trade route are  earning  $36,653 a day, a 13-month high,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. Returns have
almost tripled since the start of the year. Iranian output is
“at risk of coming off line,” potentially disrupting supply
and supporting higher freight rates, U.S. investment bank
Dahlman Rose & Co. said this week.  “The week isn’t even over yet,” said Sy. “The supply-
demand situation continues to favor owners, as there are still
eight or so cargoes to go until April 20.”  The highest weekly tally of VLCCs hired last year was 45,
reached twice in November, Sy said. Each of the ships can hold 2
million barrels of oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
