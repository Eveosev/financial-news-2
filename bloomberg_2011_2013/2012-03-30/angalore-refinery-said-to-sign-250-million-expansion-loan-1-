Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals
Ltd. (MRPL) , a unit of the Indian energy explorer Oil & Natural Gas
Corp., signed a $250 million loan, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  Bank of Baroda (BOB) , Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.,  Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. (8411)  and  State Bank of India (SBIN)  arranged the loan,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
details are private. The loan has two parts maturing in June
2017 and December 2018, one of the people said.  Proceeds will be used to expand capacity at the company’s
refinery in Mangalore on India’s west coast, the people said.
Oil & Natural Gas owned 71.63 percent of Mangalore Refinery as
of Dec. 31, according to a stock-exchange  filing .  Two calls to Narayani Mahil, New Delhi-based spokeswoman at
Oil &  Natural Gas , seeking comment on the loan were unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
