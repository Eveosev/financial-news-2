Yani Tseng moved into the lead
during the second round of the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the
first major tournament of the year on golf’s LPGA Tour.  Tseng, the world’s No. 1-ranked women’s golfer, is 8 under
par for the tournament after consecutive rounds of 4-under 68 at
the Dinah Shore Course at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho
Mirage,  California . Tseng, 23, of  Taiwan , won the title in 2010
and was runner-up to Stacy Lewis of the U.S. last year.  She’s two shots ahead of  South Korea ’s Sun Young Yoo and
three ahead of Na Yeon Choi and Se Ri Pak, also of South Korea;
Candie Kung of Taiwan, and  Australia ’s Lindsey Wright, who has
yet to begin her second round.  Tseng is the youngest golfer of either gender to win five
major championships. She’s won two straight tournaments and
three of the first five on the tour this year.  First-round leader Amy Yang of South Korea dropped back
into a tie for seventh at 4 under after a 2-over 74 today.  Lewis, who last year became the fourth golfer to make the
Kraft Nabisco her first title on the tour, is at 1 over.  Michelle Wie, who will graduate from  Stanford University  in
June with a degree in communications, is 14 shots behind Tseng
and probably will miss the cut after rounds of 73 and 77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
