Spanish and Italian bonds led gains
among  Europe ’s higher-yielding government securities as euro-
area finance ministers agreed to increase the region’s bailout
fund to help contain the debt crisis.  Italian securities extended a quarterly gain as ministers
put the total size of the firewall at 800 billion euros ($1.07
trillion), including bailouts already given to  Greece , Ireland
and  Portugal . Spanish bonds rose the most in a week as the
cabinet passed its budget a day after workers went on strike
over changes to labor rules. German bunds were little changed.  “Near-term event risk is out of the way, supporting
Spanish and Italian bonds,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-
income strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “It’s
good for risk sentiment that euro-zone ministers reached
agreement on the size of the firewall. The Spanish budget was
much as expected. It’s a case of looking at the details and the
implementation risk.”  Spain ’s 10-year yield fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 5.35 percent at 4:42 p.m. London time, the
biggest decline since March 23. The 5.85 percent bond due in
January 2022 rose 0.935, or 9.35 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 103.815.  The Italian  10-year yield  declined nine basis points to
5.12 percent, down from 7.11 percent at the end of last year.  European governments capped fresh rescue lending at 500
billion euros, bringing the size of the firewall to 800 billion
euros, according to a statement after a meeting in Copenhagen
today. The finance ministers ruled out using the 240 billion
euros left in the temporary rescue fund to go beyond that.  Sum ‘Important’  “This sum is important,” Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said. “Considering the involvement of the  International
Monetary Fund  as well as the discussions at the G-20, joint
participation depends on what Europe does -- and Europe has now
fixed this sum clearly.”  Finance ministers also agreed to get the European Stability
Mechanism up to full capacity by mid-2014, two years earlier
than previously planned. Governments will pay in two
installments of capital this year, two more in 2013 and the
final tranche in the first half of 2014.  Spain’s  two-year note  yield dropped eight basis points to
2.52 percent, while  Italy ’s two-year rate declined eight basis
points to 2.9 percent.  Spain Budget  Spanish bonds also rallied after the government of Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said it will raise corporate taxes and
reduce public spending as it seeks to make good on a pledge to
trim the deficit by more than a third this year.  “We are in a critical situation that has forced us to
respond with the most austere budget of the Spanish democracy,”
Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro said.  The extra yield or spread investors demand to hold 10-year
Spanish bonds instead of comparable German debt narrowed 11
basis points to 355 basis points.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield declined one basis point to
1.8 percent after dropping to 1.79 percent, the lowest level
since March 13.  Technical Analysis  Ten-year bund yields may decline toward 1.74 percent after
breaking below a key level of support, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Ten-year yields are extending the breach
of the 50-day moving average at 1.89 percent, the data show.  German  two-year  yields are poised to drop to 0.145 percent,
the March 8 low, after falling below the 50-day moving average
at 0.223 percent. Support is expected at 0.19 percent, the March
13 high, according to the data. They were little changed today
at 0.21 percent.  Italian bonds have returned 10 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Portuguese bonds gained 14
percent, the most of 26 sovereign markets tracked by the
indexes. Bunds have risen 0.2 percent.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets followed by  Finland , according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
