Ecuador ’s gross domestic product
expanded at the slowest annual pace in more than a year in the
fourth quarter, the central bank said.  The economy grew 6.1 percent from the year-earlier period,
bringing full-year growth to 7.8 percent, the bank said in a
report on its website today. From the previous three months, the
economy expanded 1 percent.  Ecuador, which uses the U.S. dollar as its official
currency, has had limited access to foreign credit since
defaulting on $3.2 billion of international bonds in 2008 and
2009. Since then, the government has relied on windfall oil
sales, new taxes and at least $7.25 billion in loans from China
to help finance the budget.  The Andean country, which depends on oil sales for about a
quarter of its government revenue, saw crude production rise 0.1
percent in the fourth quarter from the previous year, according
to the central bank. Prices for its  Oriente (LACRORIE)  oil gained 13
percent over the same period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
