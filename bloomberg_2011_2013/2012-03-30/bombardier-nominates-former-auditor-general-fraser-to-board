Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  asked former
Canadian Auditor General Sheila Fraser to follow in predecessor
Denis Desautels’s footsteps a second time by becoming a
corporate director.  The world’s third-largest aircraft maker plans to widen its
board to 15 members from 14 as Janine Bombardier, the 78-year-
old daughter of the company’s founder, retires, according to a
 proxy filing  for the May 10 shareholder meeting.  Fraser, 61, who gained prominence for a series of reports
on wasteful federal spending, is “an excellent addition,” said
Michel Nadeau, executive director of the Montreal-based
Institute for Governance of Private and Public Organizations.
“Auditor generals typically make good board members because
they are very rigorous and meticulous.”  Fraser who held the government post from 2001 to 2011,
would join Desautels at Bombardier as Chief Executive Officer
Pierre Beaudoin works toward a 2013 target for the commercial
debut of the company’s largest-ever plane, the CSeries. The
narrow-body aircraft will cost about $3.5 billion to develop.  She currently sits on the board of  Manulife Financial (MFC) 
Corp.,  Canada ’s biggest insurer, and is one of two new board
nominees. The second is Joanne Bissonnette, 50, a corporate
director for various private entities.  Desautels, who served as auditor general from 1991 through
2001, joined Montreal-based Bombardier’s board in 2003. Now 68,
he chairs the board of  Laurentian Bank of Canada .  CEO Compensation  Bombardier’s board also includes Frenchman Thierry Desmarest, the former CEO of Paris-based oil and gas company
Total SA; Jean Monty, the former CEO of Canadian
telecommunications company  BCE Inc. (BCE) ; and Canadian lawyer Daniel Johnson, a former premier of  Quebec . Janine Bombardier, who is
stepping down, has been a director since 1984 and runs the
family foundation.  Bombardier said in the filing that CEO Beaudoin’s
compensation increased by 19 percent to $8.17 million in the
fiscal year that ended Dec. 31. That included a $1.29 million
salary, $3.27 million in share-based awards, $1.48 million in
option-based awards, $1.57 million under an annual incentive
plan, $362,400 in pension contributions and $193,100 in other
compensation such as the personal use of corporate aircraft.  Bombardier’s Class B stock declined 19 percent last year.
The  shares  fell 3 cents to C$4.14 at the close of Toronto
trading today. The company plans to spend $1.5 billion this year
on equipment, property, plants and new products such as the
CSeries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
