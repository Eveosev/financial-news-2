The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 4 basis points to 162 basis
points as of 8:40 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. While the gauge is set for its highest close since March
7, itâ€™s poised to fall 44.3 basis points this quarter, its best
three-month performance since the second quarter of 2009,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index increased 3.5 basis
points to 149.5 of 11:43 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The measure is set to end the quarter down 31 basis
points, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index advanced 3 basis points to
157 basis points as of 9:32 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
