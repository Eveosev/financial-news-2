United Co. Rusal, the largest maker
of aluminum, advanced the most in almost six months in Moscow on
“window dressing” at the end of the Asian financial year.  Rusal rose as much as 8.4 percent in the Russian capital,
the biggest intraday jump since Oct. 5. It gained 5.1 percent in
 Hong Kong  today and lost 56 percent in the year ending March 31.  “It’s most likely the so-called window-dressing effect,”
said Dmitry Smolin, an analyst at UralSib Capital. “The quarter
is ending, and so is the financial year in  Asia . There is a
little rally in the stock so investors could report more
favorable returns at the end of the reporting period.”  Rusal’s Russian depositary receipts advanced 6.5 percent to
223 rubles by 12:43 p.m. in Moscow trading. They have increased
12 percent in the city this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
