OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , the world’s biggest
natural-gas producer, jumped the most in five weeks in Moscow
trading on expectations that the 2011 dividend payout will
exceed the budgeted level.  Gazprom shares advanced as much as 2.6 percent and traded
up 2.5 percent at 181.46 rubles at 1:37 p.m. on the Micex stock
exchange, the biggest gain since Feb. 24.  The state-controlled gas exporter and producer may pay
record dividends of 220 billion rubles ($7.5 billion), or 9.29
rubles a share, for last year, according to Bloomberg  estimates 
based on profit and company dividend guidance.  Net income to local accounting standards more than doubled
to 880 billion rubles last year as the Russian state-run gas
exporter and producer benefited from rising prices for  Europe .
The company budgeted 25 percent of profit for dividends, Chief
Financial Officer Andrey Kruglov said on Feb. 1.  Gazprom’s earnings “give a fresh twist to the improving
dividend outlook for the Russian stock market,” VTB Capital
said in a research note today. “The gas giant’s net income came
above expectations and thus hints at upside risks to dividend
expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
