Commerzbank AG (CBK) , a German lender
rescued by taxpayers, won European Union approval for its
bailout by agreeing to wind down a unit and extending a ban on
acquisitions until March 2014.  Commerzbank sought EU approval to change the terms of its
2009 bailout which required it to sell its Eurohypo real-estate
unit by 2014. The bank has said a sale of the public-finance and
commercial-property lender would be difficult because of
concerns over the division’s ability to fund itself.  Germany’s second-largest lender will put Eurohypo’s
sovereign debt and parts of its commercial real estate assets
into a bad bank that will wind them down, the European
Commission said. Commerzbank can keep a small part of its own
and Eurohypo’s commercial property businesses in  Germany ,
 France , Poland and the U.K. It must reduce these assets to 25
billion euros ($33 billion) by the end of 2013.  “The winding down of Eurohypo on the balance sheet of
Commerzbank plus a prolongation of the acquisition ban are an
adequate substitute to the divestiture of Eurohypo,” said EU
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  in an e-mailed
statement.  EU regulators have required banks to sell assets to
compensate for the harm to competition caused by large amounts
of aid pumped into the industry following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
