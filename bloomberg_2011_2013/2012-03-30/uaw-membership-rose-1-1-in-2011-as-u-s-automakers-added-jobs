The United Auto Workers membership
rose 1.1 percent to 380,719 at the end of last year, the union’s
second consecutive annual gain, as U.S. automakers added
employees amid rising sales.  The UAW added 4,107 members from 376,612 in 2010, according
to a filing yesterday with the U.S. Labor Department.  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC
gained sales and boosted their share of the U.S. market last
year. While the UAW’s 2011 gain followed a 6 percent increase in
2010, the UAW’s total membership is still only about one-fourth
its size in 1979, when it peaked at 1.5 million members.  “In order to gain any kind of strength at the bargaining
table, they’re going to have to be a bigger union,” said
Kristin Dziczek, director of the labor and industry group for
the Center for Automotive Research in  Ann Arbor , Michigan.
“Organizing new workers is critical to the UAW’s future. That’s
their challenge and that’s what they’ve got to do. It won’t be
easy.”  The UAW, based in Detroit, wants to rebuild membership
after failing to organize U.S. factories of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
 Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  UAW President  Bob King 
pledged to expand the union’s bargaining power by organizing a
U.S. plant owned by an Asian or European automakers in 2011.
King failed to meet that deadline.  The union president said last year the UAW was in
discussions with automakers he didn’t identify. The UAW this
month started passing out authorization cards at  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s
plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Reuters reported last week,
citing factory workers it didn’t identify.  Automakers Hiring  GM, Ford and Chrysler will hire 14,750 workers represented
by the UAW by 2015, according to the Center for Automotive
Research. The three automakers employed 110,150 UAW-represented
workers last year, down almost two-thirds from about 300,000 in
2001, according to the center. By 2015, the U.S. automakers will
employ 120,400 UAW workers, the center estimates.  “How the UAW sustains its organization and their
membership will depend on how they grow,” Dziczek said.
“There’s going to have to be growth through organizing.”  Detroit-based GM’s U.S. light-vehicle sales last year
increased 13 percent while Ford’s, based in Dearborn,  Michigan ,
gained 11 percent and Chrysler’s rose 26 percent. The increases
for GM and Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler came two years
after they reorganized in U.S.-backed bankruptcies.  The UAW reported total assets of $1.04 billion at the end
of 2011, down from $1.08 billion a year earlier. The union said
it had total liabilities of $7.14 million at the end of last
year, up from $4.59 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
