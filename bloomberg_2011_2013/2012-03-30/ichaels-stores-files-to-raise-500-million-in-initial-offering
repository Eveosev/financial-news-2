Michaels Stores Inc. (MIK) , the arts and
crafts retailer owned by  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and Bain Capital
LLC, filed to raise $500 million in an initial public offering.  Michaels didn’t specify the number of shares it plans to
sell or the  price range  in a  filing  today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The amount is typically a
placeholder used to calculate fees and may change.  Large private-equity firms are under pressure to find exits
for their investments as they seek to raise new funds. Fund
returns, a measure the firms use to market themselves to
potential investors, are negatively affected as companies mature
in a fund’s portfolio past about five years, according to a
report last month by PitchBook Data Inc.  Sales at Michaels rose 4 percent to $4.2 billion in the
year ended Jan. 28. Profit at the company, which has almost
1,200 locations, surged 71 percent to $176 million. Chief
Executive Officer John Menzer, a former vice chairman of  Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , has been at Michaels since 2009.  A group led by Blackstone and Bain bought Michaels in a
2006 deal valued at about $6 billion. About $1.6 trillion in
leveraged buyouts were completed from 2005 to 2007, the biggest
buyout boom on record, according to London-based researcher
Preqin Ltd.  At the time, the Michaels acquisition was the biggest
announced retail buyout since a group led by Bain and  KKR & Co. (KKR) 
agreed to buy Toys “R” Us Inc. in a $6.6 billion deal in March
2005. Luxury retailer  Neiman Marcus Group Inc. (NMG)  was bought in
2005 by TPG Capital and Warburg Pincus LLC in a deal valued at
about $5 billion.  Hispanic Customers  The company sees room for at least 1,500 stores in  North
America , including new formats for smaller and urban markets,
according to the filing. Its typical customer is a woman between
the ages of 36 and 55, with a median household income of about
$75,000. Michaels says it’s targeting Hispanic customers with
classes in Spanish and marking key events such as Quinceaneras,
or fifteenth-birthday celebrations, as well as seeking to add
customers in the 8 to 18 age range.  The company had $371 million in cash and cash equivalents
on its books as of year-end, and $3.4 billion in long-term debt.
It employeed 45,300 last year, most of them part-time.  The stock will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol MIK.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) , Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG are managing the IPO.  To contact the reporters on this story:
