OAO Rosneft (ROSN) ,  Russia ’s biggest oil
producer, agreed to borrow $1 billion from OAO Gazprombank to
fund operations.  With interest, the deal totals 34.9 billion rubles ($1.19
billion), the state-controlled producer said today in a
regulatory filing after its board approved the deal. In
February, Rosneft’s board considered a loan of as much as 40.5
billion rubles from the lender, which is part owned by OAO
Gazprom, the state-run natural-gas exporter and producer.  Net  debt  climbed to $15.9 billion at the end of last year,
up 13 percent from the start of the fourth quarter and 16
percent from the start of the year, according to its  website .  Rosneft is boosting  capital spending  about 35 percent to a
record 480 billion rubles this year to help counter slowing
production growth. President-elect  Vladimir Putin  called for
Russia, the world’s biggest oil producer last year, to maintain
output at more than 500 million metric tons (10 million barrels
a day) for at least a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
