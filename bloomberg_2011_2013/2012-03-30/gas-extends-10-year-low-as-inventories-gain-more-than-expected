Natural gas futures fell, extending
a 10-year low, after a government report that showed U.S.
inventories climbed more than expected last week.  Gas slid as much as 1.7 percent, adding to yesterdayâ€™s 5.8
percent decline, after the Energy Department yesterday said
 inventories  rose 57 billion cubic feet in the week ended March
23 to 2.437 trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg showed an expected gain of 48 billion. Mild winter
weather and record production have sent prices down 29 percent
this year.  Natural gas for May delivery fell as much as 3.6 cents to
$2.113 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest intraday price since February
2002. Prices yesterday dropped to $2.149, the biggest single-day
percentage decline since March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
