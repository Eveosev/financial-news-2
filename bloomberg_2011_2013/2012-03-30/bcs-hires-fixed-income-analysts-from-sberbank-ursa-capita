BrokerCredit Service, a Russian
brokerage, hired two fixed-income analysts from OAO Sberbank and
Ursa Capital.  The retail brokerage, which is expanding to cover
institutional clients, hired Maria Radchenko from Sberbank and
Dmitry Dorofeev from Ursa, according to Andrey Podobed, who
heads the debt instruments department at BCS.  BCS is also close to completing the recruitment of a team
of former analysts from Trust National Bank, headed by Leonid
Ignatiev, Podobed said by phone today. Trust National shut down
its fixed-income division last month to focus on retail banking.  To contact the reporters on this story:
