Pro Bowl offensive tackle Jason
Peters of the  Philadelphia Eagles  tore his right Achilles tendon
and will have surgery next week.  The National Football League team said in a statement that
Peters was injured while working out, without giving details.  The Eagles didn’t give a timetable for Peters’s return.
ESPN, citing its medical analyst, Michael Kaplan, said Peters
probably would be sidelined for at least four to six months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
