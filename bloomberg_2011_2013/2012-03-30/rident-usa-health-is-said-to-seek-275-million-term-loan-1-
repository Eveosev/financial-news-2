Trident USA Health Services, a
provider of outsourced health-care diagnostic services, is
seeking $275 million in loans to support its dividend
recapitalization, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  A five-year $175 million first-lien  term loan  will pay
interest at 5.25 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. Libor, a rate banks
say they can borrow in dollars from each other, will have a
floor of 1.25 percent.  Trident is proposing to sell the loan at 98.5 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value to refinance the debt during the first year, the
person said.  A 5.5-year $100 million second-lien term piece will pay
interest at 9 percentage points more than Libor with a 1.25
percent floor, the person said. The deal is expected to be sold
to investors at 97 cents on the dollar.  Trident wonâ€™t be able to refinance the second-lien portion
during the first year, then can do so at 103 cents on the dollar
in the second year, 102 cents in the third year and 101 cents in
the fourth year, according to the person.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing for the
Sparks, Maryland-based company and will host a lender meeting
April 3 at 10 a.m. in  New York , the person said.  Mark Parrish, chief executive officer of Trident, declined
to comment.  First-lien debt is repaid first in a bankruptcy or
liquidation, second-lien debt is repaid next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
