Payrolls increased in 42 states in
February and the jobless rate declined in 29, signs of broad-
based improvement in the job market.  Ohio led the nation with a gain of 28,300 workers, followed
by Texas with 27,900, the Labor Department reported today in
Washington. The biggest drop in unemployment was in  Mississippi ,
where the jobless rate fell 0.5 percentage point to 9.5 percent.  The report follows a four-year low last week in claims for
 unemployment benefits  and new strength in consumer confidence,
indicating the labor-market recovery is helping sustain demand.
Employment increased by more than 200,000 workers in February
for a third consecutive month, giving Americans the means to
boost spending, which makes up 70 percent of the economy.  “The labor market is steadily, if slowly, strengthening,”
said  Steven Wood , chief economist at Insight Economics LLC in
Danville, California. “Another month of 200,000-plus payroll
employment in March is likely.”  The economy created a net 227,000 jobs in February, capping
the strongest six-month payroll gain since 2006, according to
figures from the Labor Department released earlier this month.
The  jobless rate  held at 8.3 percent, the lowest in three years.  Nevada remained the state with the highest jobless rate in
the nation, even after showing the second-biggest decrease in
unemployment. Its rate fell to 12.3 percent from 12.7 percent in
January, today’s report showed.  Rhode Island  was next at 11
percent, followed by California at 10.9 percent.  Michigan Unemployment  Over the past year, the jobless rate dropped the most in
Michigan, going from 10.7 percent in February 2011 to 8.8
percent last month.  North Dakota , with joblessness at 3.1 percent, remained the
state with the lowest rate of unemployment.  New York  registered the third-biggest gain in payrolls last
month, showing a 24,700 increase.  State and local employment data are derived independently
from the national statistics, which are typically released on
the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject
to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller
surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to
the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
