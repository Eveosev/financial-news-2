The Czech government plans to
increase value-added tax rates to boost budget revenue and
narrow the deficit,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Premier

three parties in the ruling coalition havenâ€™t yet agreed on
whether to raise income tax for the highest earners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
