Sergei Shoigu , who’s been  Russia ’s
Emergency Minister since 1991, is among candidates proposed as
the new head of the Moscow region.  Shoigu, 56, the longest-serving minister in the Russian
government, may replace Boris Gromov, who’s held the post since
January 2000 and whose third term ends in May, according to a
statement today on the ruling United Russia party’s website.  United Russia has proposed two other candidates: Igor
Parkhomenko, first deputy head of Moscow’s regional government,
and Alexander Khodyrev, who heads the Reutov city
administration. President Dmitry Medvedev must approve the final
candidate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
