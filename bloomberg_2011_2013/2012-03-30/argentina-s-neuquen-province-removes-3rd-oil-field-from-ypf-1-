Argentina ’s Neuquen province
removed a concession from  YPF SA (YPFD)  to tap the Don Ruiz oil field,
which straddles the Vaca Muerta shale oil deposit in the south
of the country, according to a  notice  on the provincial website.  The field is the third concession that the provincial
government withdrew from the Buenos Aires-based oil producer
because it hasn’t invested enough there, it said. The other two
were taken earlier this month by the province.  Don Ruiz is a 109 square kilometer (42.1 square miles)
field that straddles the Vaca Muerta and Los Molles formations.
YPF said Feb. 9 that a 8,000 square kilometer area of Vaca
Muerta surveyed by external auditors holds at least 23 billion
barrels of oil equivalent, with its share at 13 billion barrels.  YPF surged in trading yesterday after it announced the
discovery of another 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent in
neighboring Mendoza province. The company said the discovery
proves the Vaca Muerta geology extends into Mendoza.  To contact the reporter on this story:
