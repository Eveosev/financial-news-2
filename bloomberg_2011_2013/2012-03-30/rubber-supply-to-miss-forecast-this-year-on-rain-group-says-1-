Natural rubber supply will expand
less than forecast this year after unseasonal rains disrupted
tapping and growers cut output on reduced demand from  China , the
 Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries  said.  Production from members, representing 93 percent of global
supply, may rise 1.1 percent to 10.42 million metric tons, less
than the 2.6 percent gain predicted last month, the group said
in its monthly bulletin today. Production increased 8.6 percent
to 10.305 million tons in 2011, it said.  Limited supply may help extend a 24 percent rally in
futures in  Tokyo  this year, potentially increasing costs for
companies such as  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , Michelin & Cie. and
 Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) , the top three tire makers.  “Prices are expected to improve at a slow pace driven by
supply concerns extending beyond the wintering season,” the
group said. While the global economy showed signs of
improvement, the recovery seems to be slow and hesitant, it
said.  Output may remain ‘low’ during April and May as farmers
resume tapping after the low production period, the group said.
Production fell 5.1 percent in the first quarter, it said.
Demand for natural rubber from members, representing 57 percent
of global demand, may rise 4.5 percent this year to 6.44 million
tons, according to the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
