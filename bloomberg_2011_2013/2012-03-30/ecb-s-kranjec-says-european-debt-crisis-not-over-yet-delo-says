European Central Bank Governing
Council member Marko Kranjec said he won’t be convinced the
euro-area debt crisis is over until he sees a stronger economic
recovery.  “I am conservative by nature and until I see some very
robust results, I will not be convinced the crisis is over,”
Kranjec, who is also governor of  Slovenia ’s central bank, said
in a pre-released interview with the Delo  newspaper . “We have
seen the fall of yields on debt by all periphery countries, but
we cannot exclude another contagion. Personally, I don’t see the
light at the end of the tunnel.”  The ECB’s three-year loans to European banks, which eased
turbulence on financial markets, have so far failed to spur
lending to the real economy, Kranjec said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
