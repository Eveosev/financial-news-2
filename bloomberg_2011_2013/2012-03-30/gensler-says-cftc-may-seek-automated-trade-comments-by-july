The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  may seek comment before July on ways to test and
supervise automated and high-frequency trading systems, said
 Gary Gensler , the agency’s chairman.  The agency, which has scrutinized such trading in the wake
of the May 2010 crash that temporarily roiled markets, is
considering a so-called concept release, which is a regulatory
step prior to publishing proposed new rules for direct  market
access .  “I’m hopeful we’d put that out for public comment this
spring. The document is pretty far along,” Gensler told
reporters after a speech at the Agribusiness Club of Washington.  The concept release would cover testing, supervision and
protections of participants with direct market access, “to
ensure orderly trading in markets,” he said.  The CFTC’s technology advisory committee, led by Republican
Commissioner Scott O’Malia, held a meeting yesterday on high-
frequency trading.  Automated trading firms’ role in periods of market
swings drew attention from regulators after a May 6, 2010, crash
that briefly erased $862 billion from the value of U.S. shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
