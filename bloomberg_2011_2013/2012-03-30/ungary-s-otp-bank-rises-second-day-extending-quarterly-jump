OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, rose for a second day, extending its biggest quarterly
advance in two years.  The shares gained 0.4 percent to 3,866 forint by 12:31 p.m.
in Budapest. A close at that level would mean a 3.3 percent
slump in March and a 20 percent increase in the first three
months of 2012, the best quarterly performance since the same
period of 2010.  European stocks rose, trimming weekly losses, as euro-area
finance ministers began talks to bolster the region’s rescue
funds and investors awaited a report that may show American
consumer spending increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
