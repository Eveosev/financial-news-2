Colombia’s peso posted its biggest
weekly decline in four months as speculation mounted that policy
makers will take additional measures to stem what had been the
region’s biggest rally this year.  The peso declined 1.6 percent this week, the most since the
five days ended Nov. 25. The losses cut into an advance this
year that had reached 10 percent through last week, more than
all other major currencies in  Latin America . It was little
changed today, rising 0.2 percent to 1,788.75.  Investors are anticipating Colombian policy makers will
take more steps to weaken the currency after Finance Minister
Juan Carlos Echeverry told reporters March 28 that the central
bank should consider boosting dollar purchases and study
possible “surprise” moves to halt the peso’s advance.  The currency weakened after Echeverry said he backed more
aggressive actions, leading investors who were long the peso to
close their positions, said Juan Nicolas Garcia, a currency
trader at HSBC Holdings Plc’s Colombia unit. “There were big
bets in the market for the peso to break 1,750,” he said.  An exchange rate of 1,700-to-1,750 pesos per dollar is
“tough” for exporters, Echeverry said in a speech on March 28
at the nation’s Senate.  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent peso-denominated bonds
due in 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,to
7.25 percent in Bogota, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
