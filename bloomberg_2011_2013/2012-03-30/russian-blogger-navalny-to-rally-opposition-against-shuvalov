Russian anti-graft blogger Alexei
Navalny plans to rally opposition in an Internet campaign
against First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, who he
accuses of corruption.  Navalny published documents on financial transactions
carried out by companies owned by Shuvalov after the Financial
Times and the Wall Street Journal reported that the official’s
family benefited from buying shares in state-owned OAO Gazprom
in 2004.  “It’s a great case because we have all the documents
against Shuvalov,” Navalny, who joined street protests opposing
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s rule, said today by phone.
“This will be a campaign of public political pressure.”  Shuvalov denies involvement in financial activities that
could discredit his status as a government official, according
to an e-mailed statement this week. A group named “Shuvalov on
trial” was registered today on Facebook Inc. and had about
1,900 members by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
