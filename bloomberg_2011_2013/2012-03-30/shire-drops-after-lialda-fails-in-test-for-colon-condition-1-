Shire Plc (SHP)  fell the most in almost
three years in London trading after saying its Lialda drug for
ulcerative colitis failed in a trial that may have expanded its
use and potentially reached sales of more than $2 billion.  Shire shares sank 4.6 percent to close at 2,020 pence, the
steepest decline since May 2009.  The treatment failed to meet the main goal in a test of 592
patients with  diverticulitis , a condition where pouches that
form in the wall of the colon get inflamed or infected, the
Dublin-based company said today in a statement. The trial would
have been the last of three stages of human tests usually needed
for approval, which the company said it will no longer pursue.  If the drug worked for diverticulitis, it might have
brought in more than $2 billion with 900,000 U.S. users at its
peak, JPMorgan analysts wrote in a report dated March 8. At the
time of the report, the bank estimated potential sales of $500
million with 200,000 users. The drug  generated  $372.1 million in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
