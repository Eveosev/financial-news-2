European Union foreign policy chief
 Catherine Ashton  won’t attend the Friends of Syria meeting in
Istanbul on April 1.  “She won’t be attending because of agenda reasons,”
 Michael Mann , the EU foreign affairs spokesman, told reporters
today in Brussels. “We will send a high-ranking member of the
External Action Service to replace her.”  Mann said the EU is “very pleased that the Syrian regime
has apparently decided to follow” the peace plan put forward by
United Nations envoy  Kofi Annan .  “But what’s important for us is that this is really put
into practice,” he said. “In the past, we’ve seen that they
were prepared to do things but that they didn’t actually do at
the end of the day. So we want the Syrians to follow Mr. Annan’s
plan in realty to reduce violence. We will monitor the
situation.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
