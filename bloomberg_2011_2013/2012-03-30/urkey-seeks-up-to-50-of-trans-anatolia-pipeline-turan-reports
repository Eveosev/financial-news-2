Turkey  expressed an interest in
raising its stake in the planned Trans-Anatolia gas pipeline to
as much as 50 percent from 20 percent, Azeri news service  Turan 
reported, citing Turkish officials it didn’t identify.  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar, holds 80 percent of
the pipeline project, known as Tanap, which is designed to carry
natural gas from the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz field in the  Caspian
Sea  to Europe via Turkey.  Socar hasn’t received an offer from the Turkish government
or from state-owned pipeline company Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol
Tasima AS, Socar Vice President Elshad Nassirov said earlier
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
