Computer hackers are planning to
attack a European  power auction website  tomorrow and may block
delivery of international transmission capacity, the agency
running the site said in a letter to energy traders.  The hacker group Anonymous is planning to attack servers
owned by the CAO Central Allocation Office GmbH in Freising,
 Germany , according to the Polish unit of Mercuria Energy Group
Ltd., which received the letter.  A potential hacker attack may be dangerous to market
participants as problems in delivering auction results would
hinder scheduling deliveries to customers, Tomasz Krzyzewski, a
director of power trading at Mercuria, said. The U.S. on March 6
charged six alleged members of Anonymous, LulzSec and other
hacking groups with trying to break into computers used by News
Corp.’s Fox Broadcasting and security firm HBGary Inc. and by
governments including Yemen.  “Some trading companies will likely not participate in the
auction at all given the risk,” Krzyzewski said today by phone.  The letter is a preventive measure and the agency did not
believe the attack would happen and that it would be successful,
Jan Radesinsky, allocation operator at CAO, said by phone.  “If it does, it’s better to be prepared,” he said. “If
something happens, auction results would be still accessible at
a different IP address.”  CAO was set up by grid managers from Germany,  Austria ,
 Poland ,  Czech Republic , Slovakia, Slovenia and  Hungary  to manage
auctions for daily, monthly and yearly cross-border power
capacity in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
