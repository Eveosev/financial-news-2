Erwin Sanft, chief strategist for
pan- Asia  equities at BNP Paribas SA, comments on Asian equities
in an interview on Bloomberg Television in  Hong Kong . He is
overweight on  China , India and South Korea, meaning investors
should buy more shares than are represented in benchmark
indexes. He is underweight on Indonesia, an equivalent of a sell
rating.  On India:  “India is a risk-on trade. There are problems there in
terms of what’s happening in the macroeconomy.  But we cannot ignore the fact that India still has one of
the best growth economies in the world. Another great thing
about India is among large cap companies, there are many good
companies to invest.”  On Indonesia:  “We are not saying this is a market you can forget about.
We are just saying it got a bit overboard.  Indonesia  is one of
the economies in Asia where we are going to see a return of high
inflation much faster. That will be a big drag on the Indonesia
market.”  On South Korea:  “Korea is a good combination of tech, industrials. There’s
a lot of stocks we like, Hyundai Heavy, the shipbuilding sector,
Hynix, technology sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
