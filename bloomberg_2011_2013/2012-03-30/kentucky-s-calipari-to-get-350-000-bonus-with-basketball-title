John Calipari  of the  University of
Kentucky  has the best odds to win the men’s college basketball
championship among the coaches at this weekend’s Final Four. He
also has the most incentive, at least financially.  Calipari, 53, would get a $350,000 bonus if his top-seeded
Wildcats, with a starting lineup of three freshmen and two
sophomores, win the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament. Kentucky faces the  University of Louisville  in
tomorrow’s first national semifinal in  New Orleans , followed by
the University of  Kansas  against  Ohio State University .  All of the Final Four coaches -- Calipari, Louisville’s
 Rick Pitino , Kansas’s Bill Self and Ohio State’s Thad Matta --
have reached the championship game before, with Pitino and Self
having won titles. Collectively, the coaches have bonuses in
their contracts of $800,000 for winning the NCAA title.  “It’s par for the course,” said  Andrew Zimbalist , a
sports economist at  Smith College (85087MF)  in Northampton,  Massachusetts .
“Not only that, usually their contracts enable them to go out
and sign endorsement deals separate from that. If they’re in the
Final Four, the deals are richer and the amount they get from
motivational speaking is greater, so the actual return they get
is much greater than that bonus.”  The coaches’ contracts and salary data were obtained by
Bloomberg News using open-records laws.  Calipari has taken three schools to the Final Four without
winning a championship. The Wildcats are 5-7 favorites to win
the title on April 2, odds that break down to a 52 percent
chance of Calipari helping cut down the Superdome nets in
celebration. At those odds, a winning $7 wager would return $5
plus the original stake.  Oddsmakers’ Favorite  Las Vegas oddsmakers have listed  Kentucky  as an 8 1/2-point
favorite against Louisville tomorrow, the biggest point spread
at the Final Four since 1999, when Duke was an 11-point pick
against Michigan State before winning 68-62. The Wildcats beat
Pitino’s Cardinals 69-62 less than three months ago.  Pitino, 59, who won a national title at Kentucky in 1996
and took over at Louisville in 2001, would receive a $150,000
bonus if the Cardinals earn this year’s championship, according
to his contract. Self, 49, who coached the Jayhawks to the title
in 2008, has a $200,000 championship bonus in his contract,
while the 44-year-old Matta would get $100,000 if Ohio State
wins the final game.  “The actual contribution that the coach makes is quite
questionable and uncertain, I think, but their payoff is
enormous,” Zimbalist said in a telephone interview.  The Final Four coaches already have triggered performance
incentives totaling $815,000 over the last month.  $3.8 Million Salary  Calipari, who receives $3.8 million from Kentucky annually
in base salary and broadcasting and endorsement payments, added
a $50,000 bonus for winning the Southeastern Conference regular-
season title. He then received $100,000 for reaching the final
16 of the NCAA tournament, another $100,000 for making the
regional final and $150,000 for the Wildcats’ second straight
Final Four trip.  “I’m just worried about us playing at our best,” Calipari
said at a news conference. “If that’s not good enough, it’s
been a heck of a season.”  Matta has a $2.09 million salary this season and collected
$60,000 in bonuses for winning the Big Ten regular-season and
tournament titles, plus $40,000 for Ohio State’s NCAA tournament
appearance. He also got $20,000 for making the regional final
and $20,000 for reaching the national semifinals.  Self, who has a $3 million salary including vested deferred
payments, pocketed $50,000 for leading the Jayhawks to the Big
12 regular-season title and $100,000 for reaching the Final
Four.  Open Records  Pitino, whose annual salary also is $3 million, got $50,000
for winning the Big East tournament and another $100,000
combined when Louisville advanced to the regional semifinals and
final.  Pitino said he’s more concerned about how his team can get
past Kentucky in the first Final Four showdown between schools
from the same state since 1962.  “The way I look at Kentucky and the way I look at their
coaching staff, I marvel at excellence,” Pitino said. “There
will be people at Kentucky that will have a nervous breakdown if
they lose to us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
