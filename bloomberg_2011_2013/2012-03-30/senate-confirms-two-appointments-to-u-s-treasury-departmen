The U.S. Senate confirmed two
Treasury Department appointments yesterday,  Mary Miller  as the
undersecretary for domestic finance, and Alastair Fitzpayne as
assistant secretary for legislative affairs.  Miller was nominated by President Barack Obama on July 1.
As assistant secretary since 2010, she has been responsible for
Treasury’s management of the public debt and advises Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  on domestic finance, financial markets and
federal government lending policies. She spent 26 years working
for the T. Rowe Price Group Inc.  “For two years, Mary’s steady hand has helped Treasury
navigate a critical set of domestic finance issues, earning her
deep respect from colleagues inside and outside this building,”
Geithner said in a release.  Fitzpayne has served as Treasury’s deputy chief of staff
since January 2009 and was the department’s executive secretary
since April 2010. Prior to Treasury, he was a member of the
economics review team on the Obama-Biden transition team. He
worked on  Capitol Hill  as a legislative assistant to former
Senator Evan Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana, and senior policy
adviser for former Representative  Rahm Emanuel , a Democrat from
Illinois.  “Al has been an integral part of the Treasury leadership
team since the early days of this Administration,” Geithner
said in a release. “His deep knowledge of Congress and the
legislative process is also held in high regard throughout
 Washington  and will be an incredibly valuable asset to me and
the Department.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
