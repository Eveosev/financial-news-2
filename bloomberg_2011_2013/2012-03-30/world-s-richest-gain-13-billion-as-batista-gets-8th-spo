The 20 richest people on Earth
gained a combined $12.5 billion this week as Brazilian Eike
Batista’s net worth surged $7.2 billion after he sold a stake in
his commodities empire.  The 55-year-old tycoon sold 5.6 percent of his EBX Group
Co. holding company to Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development Co. for
$2 billion on March 26. That lifted him to eighth on the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the world’s
richest people. He held the spot for three days before sliding
back to 10th as shares of his oil producer, OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA, fell by 2.2 percent yesterday.  “Eike’s business accomplishments demonstrate that  Brazil 
is the real deal,” Eric Saucedo, a partner at New York-based
merchant-banking firm Tricap Partners & Co., said in an e-mail.
“You did not see this in previous years.”  Billionaire fortunes rose as global stocks posted the best
first-quarter rally since 1998 amid signs of economic
improvement in Europe and the U.S. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rose for the sixth week of the past seven, adding 0.8
percent to close at 1,408.47.  Mexican  Carlos Slim , the richest man in the world, gained
$1.5 billion during the week as his country’s benchmark IPC
stock index reached a record. In a decision published March 27,
antitrust regulators rejected his appeal against a ruling that
could pave the way for increased regulation of his telecom
operator, America Movil SAB. The 72-year-old has a net worth of
$70.8 billion.  Gates, Buffett  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder  Bill Gates , 56, is second on the
index with a net worth of $63.8 billion, up $664.5 million for
the week.  Warren Buffett , 81, is third with $45.4 billion. The
world’s three richest people have gained a combined $19.6
billion year to date.  Among the biggest losers of the week was Stefan Persson,
64, chairman of Swedish clothing retailer  Hennes & Mauritz AB. (HMB) 
He lost $1.2 billion on March 29 after first-quarter profit at
Europe’s second-biggest clothing retailer missed estimates. His
$24.5 billion fortune makes him the world’s 13th-richest person.  Spanish retailer  Amancio Ortega , sixth on the ranking, saw
his fortune climb by $362.1 million to $40.6 billion as shares
of his Industria de Diseno Textil SA, owner of the Zara fashion
chain, gained 0.4 percent in Madrid. Ortega’s net worth is up 16
percent year to date.  Mukesh Ambani’s wealth rose $384.9 million to $24.3 billion
as shares of Mumbai-based  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of
the world’s biggest oil-refining complex, rose for the first
time in five weeks, adding 0.9 percent. His company joined a
rally for Indian stocks after the government issued a
clarification for overseas investors on new tax proposals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
