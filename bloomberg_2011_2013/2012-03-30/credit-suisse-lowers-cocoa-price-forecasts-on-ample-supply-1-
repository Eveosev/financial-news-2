Credit Suisse Group AG reduced
price forecasts for cocoa traded in  New York , citing ample
supplies of the beans.  Prices will be at $2,100 a metric ton in three months,
below the $2,200 forecast last month, the bank said in a monthly
report e-mailed today. The chocolate ingredient will be at
$1,900 in a year, down from a previous estimate of $2,000,
according to the report.  “Global cocoa availability remains high and the market is
entering the new crop with large carryout stocks,” said  Tobias Merath , head of commodities research at the bank.  Global stockpiles of the beans climbed 295,000 tons to 1.7
million tons over the 2010-11 season that ran through last
September, according to a survey by the  International Cocoa
Organization  in  London .  Cocoa supplies may outpace demand by 7,000 tons in the
current season, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. That would
follow a surplus of 347,000 tons. The ICCO is still forecasting
a shortage of 71,000 tons and may give updated figures today at
a press conference in Ecuador, following meetings of its
members.  “We would even argue that there is a risk of an upward
revision of this figure, given that recent rains across western
Africa have been positive for the mid-crop,” Tobias said,
commenting on the ICCO’s figure.  Ivory Coast  and Ghana, the
world’s two biggest cocoa producers, are located in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
