Aston Villa captain Stiliyan Petrov
has been diagnosed with acute leukemia, the Premier League
soccer club said on its website.  The diagnosis was confirmed by tests the 32-year-old
midfielder underwent for a fever following last weekend’s loss
at Arsenal.  “We expect to learn more about Stiliyan’s situation in due
course and we have moved quickly to support him and his
family,” the club said in a  statement . “Stiliyan is cherished
by many and he will get from Villa every ounce of love and
support that we have to help bring this to a positive
conclusion.”  Petrov has appeared in 196 games since joining Villa from
Celtic during the 2006-07 season. The Bulgarian has scored four
of his nine goals for the team this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
