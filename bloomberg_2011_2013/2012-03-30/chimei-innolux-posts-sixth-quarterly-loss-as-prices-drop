Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481) ,  Taiwan ’s
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, posted its sixth
straight quarterly loss as prices fell amid oversupply and
slowing demand for panels.  The fourth-quarter net loss narrowed to NT$19.99 billion
($677.7 million) compared with NT$24.13 billion a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on full-year
results. The average of 11 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg was for a loss of NT$11.27 billion. Consolidated
revenue was NT$137.6 billion, compared with NT$136.5 billion in
2010, the figures showed.  Chimei Innolux joins display manufacturers Samsung
Electronics Co. and LG Display Co. in posting losses from making
the panels used in televisions, notebooks and tablet computers
amid a glut that has persisted for more than a year.  Global LCD revenue dropped 12 percent in 2011 to $75.5
billion, dragged down by declining demand for TVs, computer
monitors and mini notebooks, DisplaySearch, a unit of  Santa
Clara , California-based NPD Group Inc.,  said Feb. 21 .  Losses in the flat-panel display industry have continued
for six quarters, its longest downturn on record, the researcher
said in a separate  report  on Feb. 14.  “Delays in capacity expansion in 2012 and 2013 combined
with continuously increasing demand are expected to finally
start pushing the industry towards a healthier future,” said
Charles Annis, a researcher at DisplaySearch, in the report.  Chimei Innolux and a group of creditors led by  Bank of
Taiwan  agreed on a debt repayment plan on Feb. 17, the Taipei-
based lender said that day, without providing details. The
panel-maker had been seeking to negotiate about NT$200 billion
of loans, including payments on debt that had already matured,
Chief Financial Officer Eddie Chen said Feb. 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
