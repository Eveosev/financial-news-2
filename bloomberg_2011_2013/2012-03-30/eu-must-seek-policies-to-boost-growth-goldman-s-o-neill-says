European officials must focus on
policies to boost growth or the euro area will face a
“perpetual problem,” said Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman  Jim O’Neill .  “They’ve got to shift their attention away from just
austerity,” O’Neill said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television today in Cernobbio, Italy. “There has to be
something to get more broad growth, otherwise it’s going to be a
perpetual problem.”  European finance ministers are meeting in Copenhagen today
as they seek to balance international demands for a more
powerful war chest with opposition in donor countries led by
Germany to providing additional aid for underperforming
countries on  Europe ’s fringes.  Whereas some countries such as Italy are showing “genuine
signs” of structural reform, there are “many ongoing
problems” in the rest of the euro area, O’Neill said.  “There’s a hint that  Italy  has been stabilizing but we do
need more than that,” he said. “Short of something coming from
the rest of the world as an external stimulus it’s tough to see
a lot of growth in Europe.”  O’Neill said that recovery in the U.S. may help drive
global growth and that the country’s housing market “is
turning.”  “The U.S. has got some legs for at least for the next
couple of quarters,” he said. “Big picture, there remain all
sorts of issues but I think the U.S. is going to continue to
positively surprise.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
