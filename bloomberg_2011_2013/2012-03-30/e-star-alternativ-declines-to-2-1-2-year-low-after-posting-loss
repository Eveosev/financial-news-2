years after posting a net loss for 2011.  The shares dropped 7.4 percent to 2,825 forint by 12:05
p.m. in Budapest, the lowest on a closing basis since July 2009.  E-Star posted a net loss of 2.4 million euros ($3.2

posted on the website of the Budapest Stock Exchange today.  “The short-term effect will probably be a negative
reaction,” Peter Szentirmai, a Budapest-based analyst at the
broker unit of  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
