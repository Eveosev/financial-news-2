Ukraine’s winter-wheat crop may
fall 46 percent after drought and frost ruined plants, according
to the national weather center.  The crop will probably fall 8 million to 10 million metric
tons, Tetiana Adamenko, head of the center’s agro-meteorology
department, told reporters in Kiev today. The prior winter-wheat
harvest came to 21.6 million tons, figures from the state
statistics office show.  Ukraine imposed curbs on grain exports in 2010 after
drought ruined its crop. Prices rose to a 23-month high in
Chicago trading in August of that year, contributing to record
global food costs.  Grain from the current crop was lost on 35 percent to 40
percent of planted areas according to the center’s preliminary
estimate, Tetiana Adamenko, head of its agro-meteorology
department, told reporters in Kiev today.  Winter barley was ruined on 60 percent to 70 percent of
planted areas, Adamenko said. Winter rapeseed was lost on as
much as 60 percent of sown areas.  Winter grains sprouted as of today on 7.4 million hectares
(18.3 million acres), or 87 percent of planted areas, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement. Plants were
in good and satisfactory condition on 4.8 million hectares, or
65 percent, it said. The winter crop consists mostly of wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
