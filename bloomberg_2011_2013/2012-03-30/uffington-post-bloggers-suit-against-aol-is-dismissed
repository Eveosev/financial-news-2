AOL Inc. (AOL)  won dismissal of a suit by
unpaid bloggers seeking $105 million for their work on the
 Huffington Post .  U.S. District Judge John Koeltl today threw out the suit,
filed last April by writers seeking a share in AOL’s
$315 million purchase of the news and opinion website run by
 Arianna Huffington . Koeltl said the bloggers submitted pieces to
the Huffington Post for the exposure, knowing they wouldn’t be
paid.  “No one forced the plaintiffs to give their work to The
Huffington Post for publication and the plaintiffs candidly
admit that they did not expect compensation,” Koeltl said in
his opinion. “The principles of equity and good conscience do
not justify giving the plaintiffs a piece of the purchase price
when they never expected to be paid, repeatedly agreed to the
same bargain, and went into the arrangement with eyes wide
open.”  The lawsuit was filed by a group of writers led by Jonathan Tasini who were seeking to represent a class of about 9,000
unpaid Huffington Post bloggers. Koeltl rejected claims that
AOL, an online publisher based in  New York , unjustly enriched
itself by using their work and that the company engaged in
deceptive business practices.  Jeffrey Kurzon, a lawyer for the bloggers, declined to
comment, saying he hadn’t seen the ruling.  The Huffington Post said in November that it had 35 million
readers.  The case is Tasini v. AOL Inc., 11-2472, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
