Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the fourth-
biggest producer of the metal, paid Chief Executive Officer Nick Holland 32.7 million rand ($4.3 million) last year, two-thirds
of that in bonus and share benefits.  Holland earned a salary of 7.5 million rand, the
Johannesburg-based mine operator said today in an annual report
on its  website . Gold Fields, which changed its year-end to Dec.
31 from June 30 in 2010, paid Holland 6.6 million rand in the
six months through December 2010, according to the report.  Gold Fields  shares  climbed 3.3 percent in 2011. Holland is
seeking to boost production in Ghana, Australia and  Peru  while
reducing fatalities and cost increases in  South Africa , where
labor and power expenses are rising faster than inflation. Gold
is trading 12 percent lower than its record-high last May.  Barrick Gold Corp., Newmont Mining Corp. and AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. are the worldâ€™s largest gold producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
