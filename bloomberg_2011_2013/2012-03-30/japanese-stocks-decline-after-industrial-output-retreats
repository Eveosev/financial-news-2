Japanese  stocks  fell after a report
showed the nation’s industrial production unexpectedly declined
in February and as the strengthening yen damped the outlook for
exporters’ earnings.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , Japan’s biggest industrial robot maker,
slumped 2.9 percent.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , a consumer electronics
company that gets almost half of its revenue overseas, sank 1.6
percent.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer by market
value, dropped 0.7 percent after  oil prices  had their biggest
decline of the year yesterday. Daiichi Sankyo Co. fell 2.1
percent after Citigroup Inc. cut the drugmaker’s rating on the
impact of expiring patents.  “Industrial production dropping when people expected an
increase is a huge negative for Japanese stocks, weighing down
the market as a whole,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at
Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages the equivalent of
$302 billion. “The Nikkei is holding above 10,000, acting as a
support level.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slid 0.3 percent to 10,083.56
at the close in  Tokyo , paring its monthly advance to 3.7 percent.
The gauge rose 19 percent in the three months ended today, its
biggest quarterly advance since June 2009, as the yen weakened
and the U.S. showed signs of economic recovery. The broader
Topix Index slid 0.4 percent to 854.35, rising 0.2 percent for
the week. Trading volume today was 19 percent below its 30-day
average.  Manufacturing Drops  Japan’s  factory output  slid 1.2 percent in February from
the previous month, the Trade Ministry said in Tokyo today,
after a 1.9 percent gain in January. The median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 1.3 percent
increase.  Fanuc dropped 2.9 percent to 14,680 yen, the  biggest drag 
on the Nikkei. It also fell after UBS AG recommended selling the
stock, citing the company’s premium compared to its peers, high
competition and risk of correction in global manufacturing.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) , an industrial electronics products
maker, slid 1 percent to 4,735 yen, while Toshiba Corp.
retreated 1.9 percent to 364 yen.  Exporters declined after the yen touched 81.83 against the
dollar today, strengthening from as low as 83.18 yesterday. A
stronger yen reduces overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  Panasonic slumped 1.6 percent to 761 yen.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ,
a carmaker that gets more than 70 percent of sales overseas,
declined 1.4 percent to 145 yen.  Crude Declines  Energy stocks fell after oil for May delivery slumped 2.5
percent yesterday in  New York , the biggest drop since December.
Inpex slipped 0.7 percent to 559,000 yen. Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. fell 1.4 percent to 3,855 yen.  Daiichi Sankyo slid 2.1 percent to 1,508 yen after
Citigroup cut its rating on the stock, saying patents on its
major drugs are close to expiring.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.3 percent.
Declines in Japanese shares were limited ahead of U.S. data
today estimated to show growth in  consumer confidence  and
spending. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of
consumer confidence for March is expected to rise to near the
highest level in a year, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Personal income grew 0.4 percent while  consumer
spending  rose 0.6 percent, economists predicated before the
release of the data today.  Shares on the Topix are valued at 1.05 times book value, up
from 0.88 in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A number less than one means companies can be bought for less
than value of their assets.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 1.5 percent to 19.42,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  “It’s not a bearish case, but you just don’t have
sustainability for the markets to reweight higher like they did
three or four months ago,” saidAndrew Pease, Sydney-based
chief strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell
Investment Group, which oversees about $150 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
