In the early 19th century, a
giraffe became a political mediator.  Muhammad Ali, Ottoman viceroy of  Egypt , offered Zarafa to
Charles X of  France  to persuade him not to support the Greeks in
the war with the  Ottoman Empire .  And so, after a long journey, Zarafa arrived in Paris where
Nicolas Huet, the Younger, depicted the giraffe with her
caretaker Atir. They lived together in the Jardin des Plantes in
Paris for 18 years.  Zarafa is featured at the Morgan Library and Museum in a
show that explores animals as companions, moral teachers and
muses.  Don’t miss David Hockney’s 1993 drawing of his dachshunds
Bodgie and Stanley, which he describes as “intelligent, loving,
comical and often bored.”  “In the Company of Animals: Art, Literature, and Music at
the Morgan” is at 225 Madison Ave. through May 20. Information:

14-foot windows that open to the world. They sell a nice St.
Innocent Anden Chardonnay from  Oregon , which is perfect for a
Saturday afternoon.  But given this kooky weather, why not try a Spiked  Arnold
Palmer  from the new spring menu? It warms with Maker’s Mark
bourbon and cools with iced tea and lemonade.  At 299 Madison Ave. Information: +1-212-867-5535.  Saturday Afternoon  Years before “Mean Streets” and “ Taxi Driver ”
established  Robert De Niro  as a star, his father, Robert De Niro
Sr., was painting pastel representative works and palling around
with Henry Miller and  Tennessee Williams .  DC Moore Gallery is exhibiting 26 of Senior’s pictures from
1960 to 1993, the year he died. They’re offered for sale for
