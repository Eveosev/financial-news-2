Research on a more lethal re-
engineering of the avian influenza can be made public by the
scientists who created it after a review determined no immediate
threat from releasing the data, a U.S. biosecurity panel said.  The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity
recommended unanimously that a revised bird flu study by
Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the  University of Wisconsin  be published
“in full.” The board voted 12-6 to recommend publication of
“data, methods and conclusions” from a second study, by Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam.  The data “do not appear to provide information that would
immediately enable misuse of the research in ways that would
endanger public health or national security,” the board said
today in a statement.  Groups led by Fouchier and Kawaoka engineered the H1N1
virus to be more transmissible among ferrets, mammals whose
response to the flu is most like humans. The studies were
intended to demonstrate how the virus might be changed to spread
rapidly between people, giving scientists and health officials
more information in case of a pandemic.  Publication of the studies in Science and Nature has been
on hold since December, when the U.S. government asked the
journals to censor details of the research so it wouldn’t “fall
into the wrong hands,” the editor of Science said. Fouchier and
Kawaoka also agreed to suspend their research pending a review.  A World Health Organization panel met in Geneva in February
and recommended publication of the studies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
