Chinese equities  traded in the U.S.
posted their best quarter since 2010 on prospects policy makers
will step up monetary easing to combat further slowing in the
world’s second-largest economy.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. added 1.1 percent to 102.99 on March
30 in New York, bringing this year’s advance to 14 percent, the
most since the third quarter of 2010.  Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO) , a video sharing website that agreed to
be acquired by competitor Youku Inc. last month, was the biggest
gainer on the gauge, surging 169 percent in the first quarter.
Online book retailer  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  and social-
networking website Renren Inc. recorded their first quarterly
advances since starting trading in the U.S.  “The Chinese market will rally like crazy if they open up
the liquidity flood gate again,”  Uri Landesman , who helps
oversee more than $1 billion, including Chinese equities, as
managing general partner of New York-based hedge fund Platinum
Partners LLP, said by phone on March 30. “The Chinese want a
bigger growth number.”  After cutting banks’s reserve requirements by one
percentage point since November, policy makers will probably
reduce them the same amount by the end of the second quarter to
free up lending, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey released on March 30.  China  is
contemplating the lowest economic growth target in eight years
as the European debt crisis and a faltering U.S. recovery impede
demand for goods from the world’s largest exporter.  China ETF Climbs  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., gained 1 percent to $36.67 at
the end of last week, extending its second straight quarterly
gain to 5.2 percent.  American depositary receipts of Tudou, China’s second-
largest online video company, jumped 169 percent in the first
three months of 2012 for the first quarterly gain since its U.S.
initial public offering on Aug. 16.  Youku, China’s largest video website, said on March 12 that
it planned to buy Tudou in a stock swap. The announcement
ignited a 157 percent one-day surge in Tudou’s ADRs, boosting
the cost of the takeover by 40 percent to $1.29 billion, the
most expensive takeover premium among pending deals around the
world, data compiled by Bloomberg at the time showed. The deal
currently values Tudou at $870 million.  Shanghai-based Tudou slid 1.7 percent on March 30 to a
three-week low of $29.53. The ADRs reached a record-high $42.50
on March 13.  Beating Hang Seng  Youku, which means “excellent and cool” in Chinese and is
based in Beijing, gained 40 percent in the first three months of
the year in New York after three quarters of losses. The shares
posted their biggest quarterly gain since the December 2010 IPO.
Youku retreated 0.9 percent March 30 to a one-month low of
$21.99.  The quarterly jump in the Bloomberg gauge of U.S.-traded
Chinese stocks this year exceeded a 12 percent rally in the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and a 7.1 percent advance in the
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in
 Hong Kong . The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  -- whose A share market
is only open to domestic investors and approved foreign
institutions -- added 2.9 percent during the period.  China’s economy expanded 8.9 percent in the last quarter of
2011, the least since the three months to the end of June 2009.
The pace of growth slowed to 9.2 percent last year from 10.4
percent in 2010. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on March 5 that the
government is targeting a 7.5 percent economic growth rate this
year, after keeping the goal at 8 percent over the last seven
years.  Higher Valuations  E-Commerce, China’s biggest online book seller known as
Dangdang, surged 84 percent in the first three months of the
year, the first quarterly gain since its IPO in December 2010.
Dangdang’s ADRs jumped 7.9 percent on March 30 to $8.10.  Beijing-based  Renren (RENN) , which runs a social networking
website where users are required to give their real names,
surged 55 percent last quarter, the first advance since the
company’s May IPO in the U.S. Renren’s ADRs were unchanged on
March 30 at $5.52.  The Bloomberg measure of Chinese U.S.-traded stocks is
 trading  at 24 times estimated earnings for member companies,
compared with a multiple of eight times for the  Hang Seng  China
Enterprise Index and 9.6 for the Shanghai gauge.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s largest offshore oil explorer, rose the
most in the first quarter among major state-controlled, U.S.-
listed Chinese companies as 2011 profit beat analysts’ estimates
due to climbing  oil prices .  Cnooc Discounted  Cnooc’s 2011 net income jumped 29 percent in 2011 to 70.3
billion yuan ($11 billion), according to a March 28 statement.
That beat the 2 percent advance reported by  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028) , whose refining unit posted an operating loss
last year, and a 5 percent drop in net income for PetroChina
Co., the country’s biggest oil producer, figures released last
week showed.  ADRs of Cnooc advanced 1.5 percent to $204.29 on March 30,
gaining 17 percent in the quarter. The ADRs, each representing
100 underlying shares in the company, traded 0.6 percent  below 
Hong Kong shares, which added 0.3 percent March 30 to HK$15.96,
or $2.06 per share.  China Petroleum, known as Sinopec, slipped 0.3 percent to
$108.72 in  New York , trimming its  advance  in the quarter to 3.5
percent. Sinopec’s ADRs traded 0.2 percent below its Hong Kong
stock on March 30, from a 0.1 percent premium the day before.
PetroChina’s ADRs added 2 percent to $140.53, taking its
quarterly advance to 13 percent.  Higher Rates  The People’s Bank of China has kept the benchmark one-year
lending rate on hold since raising it to 6.56 percent in July,
the highest level since 2008. The one-year cost of borrowing
will be reduced this year, according to nine of 20 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Six see a decline in the 3.5 percent
deposit rate. China hasn’t cut benchmark rates since the global
financial crisis.  “Chinese stocks are very sensitive to policies,” said
Qiwei Wang, a London-based economist at Capital Economics Ltd.
who focuses on  China’s economy  and markets. “We expect China to
lower banks’ reserve requirements further this year as data
showed economic conditions are still weak,” and they will
probably start to cut rates from the second half, Wang said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
