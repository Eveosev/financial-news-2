Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  rose the most in
seven weeks in Copenhagen trading after  Denmark ’s biggest lender
said it will use a local central bank facility to draw 15
billion kroner ($2.7 billion) for commercial gains.  Danske jumped as much as 4 percent, the biggest increase
since Feb. 15. The stock rose 2.35 kroner, or 2.6 percent, to
92.35 kroner at 10:45 a.m. in the Danish capital, making it
today’s second-biggest gainer in the Bloomberg Europe Banks and
Financial Services Index of 43 companies.  “It’s a financially very attractive option to take this
money from the central bank,” Claus Groen Therp, an equity
analyst at Enskilda Securities in Copenhagen, said in an phone
interview. “This is cheap money.”  Danske will use assets from its bond portfolio as
collateral for the three-year loan, which it will take from a
“purely commercial point of view,” the Copenhagen-based lender
said. The central bank is offering the loans as of today to help
lenders in the Nordic country repay 146 billion kroner in state-
backed debt due next year.  Danske will probably first deploy the cash in a carry trade
and later use it to reduce its funding need, according to Therp,
who recommends buying Danske shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
