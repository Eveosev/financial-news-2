Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer by market value, paid Michael McLintock, head of fund
unit M&G, 7.6 million pounds ($12.2 million) last year, 60
percent more than Chief Executive Officer  Tidjane Thiam .  McLintock will receive 6 million pounds in long-term
incentive pay in addition to 1.6 million pounds in salary and
bonuses, Prudential said in its  annual report  published today.
Thiam received 4.7 million pounds in base pay, bonuses and long-
term incentives, 3 percent less than in 2010.  Prudential is rewarding McLintock after M&G grew to be the
U.K.’s second-biggest retail fund manager, up from fifth-largest
four years ago, as investors flocked to its bond funds in the
aftermath of the financial crisis. M&G’s funds under management
grew 2 percent to 201 billion pounds even as the MSCI World
Index dropped 7.6 percent in the year.  “Michael McLintock’s remuneration is structured in line
with market practice in the fund-management industry,”
Prudential said in an e-mailed statement. “M&G has had three
very successful years. It has been number one in net flows for
13 consecutive quarters and between 2009 and 2011, M&G’s profit
grew by 103 percent.”  Schroders Plc (SDR) , the fourth-largest U.K. fund manager by
assets under management, paid CEO Michael Dobson 3.1 million
pounds in 2011, 10 percent less than the previous year. The
firm’s assets under management dropped 4.7 percent to 187.3
billion pounds, according to its  annual report .  Wells, Foley  McLintock’s pay, which was 40 percent more than the 5.4
million pounds he received in 2010, helped almost double the
aggregate remuneration for all of Prudential’s executive
directors in 2011. As U.S. CEO Mike Wells and Chief Risk Officer
John Foley were added to that board, the executives were paid
29.8 million pounds last year, compared with 16.5 million pounds
in 2010.  Prudential, which has threatened to quit the U.K. due to
new European solvency rules, is “on track” to meet its self-
imposed targets to double 2009 operating profit by next year and
make its Asian unit able to fund itself, Thiam said on March 13.
The company currently invests its U.K. profits in  Asia , where it
gets about 40 percent of its revenue.  The insurer’s operating profit rose 7 percent to 2.07
billion pounds in the 12 months to Dec. 31, boosted by profit in
Asia and surpassing the 2.02 billion-pound median estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The stock declined 4.4 percent in 2011, less than the  FTSE
ASX Life Insurance Index (FALIFE) , which dropped 4.8 percent.  “Over the past three years Prudential has delivered almost
1.7 times the total shareholder return generated by its
comparator group of large U.K. and international insurers,” the
company said. “Executive directors’ share awards are directly
linked to that performance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
