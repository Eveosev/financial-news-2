Kenya’s Monetary Policy Committee
meets on April 4 to discuss its latest interest-rate stance. The
central bank left the benchmark policy measure at a record 18
percent for the third consecutive meeting on March 6 as surging
 oil prices  added pressure to inflation and the currency in East
Africa’s biggest economy.  Neighboring  Uganda ’s central bank will announce its
monetary policy stance on April 2. The Bank of Uganda earlier
this month cut its benchmark rate for the second consecutive
month by 1 percentage point to 21 percent.  Statistics Mauritius announces March inflation data on
April 6. Inflation slowed to a 15-month low of 4.1 percent in
February.
