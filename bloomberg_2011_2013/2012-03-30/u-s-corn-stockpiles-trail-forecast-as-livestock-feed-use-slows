(Corrects headline and first two paragraphs to note
inventories are the lowest in eight years; Adds analyst comment
in third paragraph.)  Corn inventories  in the U.S., the
world’s biggest grower and exporter, were down 7.9 percent on
March 1 from a year earlier, the government said. Wheat supplies
fell 16 percent, while soybeans reserves rose.  Corn stockpiles on March 1 totaled 6.009 billion bushels,
down from 6.523 billion a year earlier and the lowest for that
time of year since 2004, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
today in a report. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey expected 6.16
billion, on average.  “It’s going to be a tight supply situation until farmers
begin harvesting this year’s crops,” Marty Foreman, an
economist for Doane Advisory Services Co. in  St. Louis , said
before the report. “We still need to grow a good crop this year
to rebuild inventories.”  Before today, corn futures tumbled 11 percent since
reaching a five-month high on March 19 on the Chicago Board of
Trade, partly on concern that USDA would report a higher
inventory estimate than analysts expected.  Analysts missed the USDA quarterly inventory forecasts for
corn by an average of 225 million bushels in the past seven
quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s twice
as much as in the previous five years and about equal to 12
months of Russian consumption.  Corn Market  Corn futures for May delivery fell 2.6 percent to $6.04 a
bushel yesterday on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, after earlier
touching a two-month low at $6.03.  “The biggest price factor for corn over the next month to
six weeks will be planting progress and how much rain falls in
parts of the Midwest where soil moisture has been depleted,”
Foreman said.  U.S. wheat inventories at the start of this month totaled
1.201 billion bushels, down 16 percent from 1.425 billion a year
earlier and below the 1.25 billion expected by analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Wheat futures in Chicago before today dropped 17 percent in
the past year as world inventories before the start of the
Northern Hemisphere harvest are forecast to rise to a 12-year
high. Yesterday, the May contract tumbled 2.9 percent to settle
at $6.125 a bushel.  Soybean inventories  on March 1 totaled 1.372 billion
bushels, up 9.9 percent from the 1.249 billion a year earlier,
the USDA said. The average analyst estimate was 1.371 billion
bushels.  Consumption of the oilseed in the three months ended Feb.
29 totaled 998 million bushels, down 3 percent from a year
earlier, the USDA said.  Soybean futures for May delivery declined 0.9 percent to s
$13.555 a bushel yesterday on the CBOT. On March 25, the price
touched $13.885, the highest since September as drought damaged
crops in Brazil and Argentina, the two biggest growers after the
U.S.  Corn is the most valuable U.S. crop, followed by soybeans,
hay and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
