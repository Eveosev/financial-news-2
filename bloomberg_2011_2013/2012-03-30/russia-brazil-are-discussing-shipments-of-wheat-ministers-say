Russia  and  Brazil  are discussing
shipments of the former Soviet state’s wheat to the South
American country.  Yelena Skrynnik, Russia’s agriculture minister, and
Brazilian counterpart Jorge Mendes Ribeiro Filho discussed
exports of the grain at a meeting in Moscow today, the Russian
agriculture ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  “I am sure that shipments of Russian wheat will become an
important item in our countries’ trade volume,” Ribeiro said in
the statement. He said he would promote Russian wheat in the
Brazilian market, according to the ministry, which gave no
further details on the possible volume of  wheat supplies .  The ministers met to discuss agricultural cooperation,
including meat shipments after Russia banned supplies from some
Brazilian packing plants last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
