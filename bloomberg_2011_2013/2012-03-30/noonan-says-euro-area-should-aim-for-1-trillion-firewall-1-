Euro-area finance ministers should
commit to an emergency lending capacity of at least $1 trillion
to reassure investors in the face of the region’s debt crisis,
Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said today.  “The market reaction to these is to the dollar amounts, so
anything that gets you $1 trillion looks like a serious
firewall,” Noonan told reporters before a meeting of European
finance ministers in Copenhagen today. “The maximum that could
be on the table today would be 940 billion euros ($1.3 billion).
That would be a very impressive figure and would send a very
clear signal to the markets.”  Finance ministers neared an agreement to run the temporary
and permanent funds in parallel until mid-2013, potentially
raising the upper limit on emergency lending to 940 billion
euros. Amounts immediately available would range from 340
billion euros to 640 billion euros. Noonan said a suggestion of
his German colleague  Wolfgang Schaeuble  of a firepower of 800
billion euros would probably be sufficient.  “That seems to me to be getting into the ballpark of what
is required,” he said. “But I’m not quite sure what the
composition of the eight is yet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
