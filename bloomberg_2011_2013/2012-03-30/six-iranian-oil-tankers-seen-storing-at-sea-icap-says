Six Iranian supertankers are
storing oil at sea, according to ship-tracking data compiled by
ICAP Shipping International Ltd.  Four very large crude carriers owned by NITC Co. are being
used for short-term storage and another two for long-term
storage, Simon Newman, head of tanker research at London-based
shipbroker ICAP, said in an e-mail today. Four of NITCâ€™s
supertankers are on voyages, down from six last week, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
