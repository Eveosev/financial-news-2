Switzerland  has issued arrest
warrants for commercial espionage against three tax inspectors
from the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia,  Bild am Sonntag 
reported in a preview of an article to run today.  The arrest warrants were issued for the purchase in
February 2010 of CDs with information on German customers at
Credit Suisse, the newspaper said, citing a letter from Swiss
authorities received in Dusseldorf yesterday.  The three inspectors risk being arrested if they travel to
Switzerland, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
