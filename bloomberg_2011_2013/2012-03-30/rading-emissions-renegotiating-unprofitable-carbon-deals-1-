Trading Emissions Plc is seeking to
renegotiate unprofitable carbon contracts and there are
“encouraging” initial signs that Chinese sellers are taking a
“pragmatic approach to the problem.”  The company has an unhedged exposure of 11 million metric
tons of Certified Emission Reduction credits, Trading Emissions
said today in a statement distributed by the Regulatory News
Service. They would be worth 39.7 million euros ($53.1 million)
at yesterday’s closing price of December credits of 3.61 euros a
ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  The carbon assets have a “negative valuation” of 18
million pounds ($29 million), the company said, citing a report
from a firm of accountants that it didn’t identify in the
statement.  Shares in the company have plunged 74 percent in the past
year as the price of credits dropped because of oversupply in
the European Union carbon market. The shares hadn’t traded today
in London.  The company has cash of 62 million pounds and other assets
of 140 million pounds, according to the statement.  The credit plunge was caused by “persistent depressed
demand” and the company is seeking to do everything that’s
“lawfully available to it” to minimize its exposure, it said.
“Initial reception from many sellers has been positive,
provided that, as part of the negotiations, the company agrees
to purchase post-2012 CERs at an agreed discount to the market
price at the time of delivery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
