China Southern Airlines Co. (ZNH)  climbed
the most in  New York  in eight weeks as Asia’s biggest airline by
passenger numbers said it expects to fly its Airbus SAS A380s
internationally this year after overcoming regulatory delays.  The American depositary receipts of the Guangzhou, China-
based carrier, the country’s only operator of A380s, surged 5
percent, the most since Feb. 3, to $23.63 at the close of
trading in New York. The ADRs, each representing 50 common
shares, have declined 7.2 percent this quarter. China Southern’s
 shares  gained 3.3 percent today to HK$3.71 in Hong Kong, the
equivalent of 50 U.S. cents, for a quarterly decline of 5.6
percent.  China Southern Chairman Si Xianmin told reporters in  Hong
Kong  today that the airline, the country’s biggest for domestic
services, will fly the A380 internationally this year. The
carrier plans to fly the planes to the U.S. and  Europe , he said.
The airline, which has three A380s, will receive a fourth in
September followed by the fifth and final one early next year,
Si said.  The carrier expects to receive a total of 57 new planes
this year, including its first Boeing Co. 787 in the third
quarter, as it expands international services amid slowing
domestic travel growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
