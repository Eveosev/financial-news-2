Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)  is seeking to
scale back an expansion of the Prairie Island nuclear plant
following a drop in natural gas prices, a filing showed.  Xcel  said  it is now economical to increase production
capacity at the two-reactor, 1,096-megawatt plant by 135
megawatts instead of the 164 proposed in 2008, according to a
filing today to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.  Natural gas prices “have fallen dramatically” and energy
demand will probably grow at a lower rate than projected four
years earlier, the Minneapolis-based company said.  The benefit to consumers from the expansion of  Prairie
Island , located 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of
 Minneapolis , has been cut to $50 million from the previous
estimate of $278 million given the drop in gas prices, Xcel
said. The revision “reflects the fundamental change in the gas
market due to shale gas exploration and the trend of declining
natural gas price forecasts,” the company said.  The Energy Department predicts natural gas prices will
remain below $6 per million British thermal units through 2020,
down from a 2007 forecast for gas priced at $10 per million Btu
in 2020, Xcel said in its filing.  Gas futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 29
percent during the first three months of this year to $2.126 per
million Btu, the lowest settlement price since Feb. 6, 2002. In
2008, when the Xcel project was proposed, Nymex prices for next-
month delivery reached an intraday high of $13.694 on July 2.  Xcel said that cutting the number of megawatts in the
project by 18 would reduce costs to $310 million from the
initial estimate of $322 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
