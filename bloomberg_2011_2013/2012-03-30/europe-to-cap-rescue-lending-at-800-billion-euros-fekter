Euro-area governments agreed to cap
overall rescue lending at 800 billion euros ($1.1 trillion),
rejecting calls for even bigger defenses against the debt
crisis, Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said.  Some 300 billion euros in already pledged loans will go
along with 500 billion euros in the planned permanent rescue
fund to build the backstop, Fekter said. Funds remaining in the
temporary rescue fund would be used only to get the permanent
fund up to its target, she said.  “The  euro zone  is a lot more stable than a few months
ago,” Fekter told reporters at a meeting of European finance
ministers in Copenhagen today.  European policy makers are trying to strike a balance
between meeting international demands for a more powerful war
chest and opposition in donor countries led by Germany to
providing additional aid for underperforming economies on the
region’s fringes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
