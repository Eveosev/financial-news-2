Greece  could save as much as 110
million euros ($147 million) a year by halting payment of false
medical benefits, Deputy Health Minister Marcos Bolaris said.  The amount Greece loses each year in benefits paid to about
40,000 citizens who arenâ€™t entitled to them could pay for the
construction of a 400-bed hospital, Bolaris told lawmakers in
Athens late yesterday.  Greece, in its fifth year of recession, is pushing to stamp
out corruption in areas including the health-care system as it
cuts spending to meet targets as part of a second bailout from
the European Union and  International Monetary Fund .  The health ministry plans to fine recipients of unwarranted
payments and to discipline doctors and staff, Bolaris said. An
auditing service will be set up to handle the cases and the
state will seek to get back the money with interest, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
