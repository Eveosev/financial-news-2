The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24  raw materials  rose 0.7 percent to settle at 688.71 at 4:07
p.m.  New York  time, led by grains.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI Index of 26  prices  advanced 1.2
percent to 1,603.89.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn surged the most in 21 months, wheat posted the biggest
gain since October and soybeans rallied after government
forecasts signaled tighter U.S. crop supplies, renewing concerns
that food inflation will quicken.  Corn inventories on March 1 fell more than analysts
forecast to the lowest for this time of year since 2004, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Wheat
reserves dropped to a three-year low, and planting intentions
trailed estimates. Farmers will sow 73.902 million acres with
soybeans this year, down 1.4 percent from 2011 and the lowest in
five years, the agency said after surveying farmers.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for May
delivery jumped by the exchange limit of 40 cents, or 6.6
percent, to $6.44 a bushel, the highest since June 30, 2010.  Wheat futures for May delivery soared 7.9 percent to
$6.6075 a bushel, the biggest gain since Oct. 11.  Soybean futures for May delivery increased 3.5 percent to
$14.03 a bushel, the largest advance since Oct. 11.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil climbed after reports showed U.S. consumer
sentiment and spending rose, and President  Barack Obama  cleared
the way for new sanctions targeting  Iran .  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , oil futures for May
delivery rose 0.2 percent to $103.02 a barrel.  Brent oil for May settlement gained 0.4 percent to $122.88
a barrel on the London- based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  BP Plc sold North Sea Forties at the biggest discount to
dated Brent in two months, while Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to
buy a shipment of the blend at the highest premium in nearly two
weeks. There’s a 10-day gap between the loading dates of the two
cargoes.  Two more cargoes of Forties crude for loading in April were
dropped, bringing total cancellations for next month to three
shipments, according to four people with knowledge of the export
program. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals in  Europe 
for the second straight day.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline had the biggest quarterly gain in a year on
speculation that refinery closures and seasonal repairs will
trim supplies of summer-grade fuel in the eastern U.S. at a time
when demand typically rises.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for April delivery fell 0.3
percent to $3.3899 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for April delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$3.1684 a gallon.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures rose as the dollar’s decline bolstered demand
for the precious metal as an alternative investment.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for June delivery
rose 1 percent to $1,671.90 an ounce.  Silver futures for May delivery increased 1.5 percent to
$32.484 an ounce.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for July delivery climbed 1
percent to $1,644.10 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery advanced 1.5 percent to
$654.10 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper futures rose, capping the biggest quarterly gain
since 2010, on signs of economic expansion in the U.S., the
world’s second-biggest consumer of the metal.  On the Comex, copper futures for May delivery advanced 0.8
percent to $3.825 a pound.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 1.1 percent to $8,445 a metric ton ($3.83 a pound.)  Lead, tin and nickel also advanced in London. Aluminum and
zinc fell.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee rose for the first time in three days on speculation
that the biggest quarterly price slump in 12 years will spur
demand from processors.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, arabica coffee for May
delivery jumped 3.4 percent to $1.8245.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to
24.71 cents a pound.  Cocoa futures for May delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
$2,219 a metric ton.  Cotton futures for May delivery declined less than 0.1
percent to 93.52 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery fell 1.6 percent to
$1.645 a pound.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas dropped, extending a slump to the lowest in 10
years, as slack demand and record production contribute to a
ballooning inventory surplus.  On the Nymex, gas futures for May delivery declined 1.1
percent to $2.126 per million British thermal units, the lowest
settlement since Feb. 6, 2002. In the first quarter, the price
tumbled 29 percent, the most in two years.  U.K. summer gas rose on speculation that heating demand
will rise next week and flows from  Norway  will drop.  The contract climbed 0.95 pence to 61.7 pence a therm at
4:45 p.m. in London, according to broker prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s equal to $9.97 per million Btu. A therm is
100,000 Btu.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures rose for the first time in three sessions on
speculation that demand may rebound after U.S. pork prices
dropped to a 14-month low.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for June
settlement advanced 0.4 percent to 90.4 cents a pound.  Cattle futures for June delivery declined 2 percent to
$1.1615 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement dropped 1.8
percent to $1.49125 a pound.  ----With assistance from Ben Farey, Sherry Su and Tony C.
