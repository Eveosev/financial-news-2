The forint gained, capping the
strongest quarter in 2 1/2 years as Hungary sought a bailout
from the  International Monetary Fund  and European governments
increased funds used to fight the region’s debt crisis.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 295.24 per
euro by 4:23 p.m. in Budapest. That means a 6.7 percent advance
in the past three months, the most since the second quarter of
2009 and the second-best performance for the period worldwide
after the Polish zloty. The rally in the government’s 10-year
bonds cut yields 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to
9.08 percent, compared with as high as 10.8 percent on Jan 4.  European ministers today approved fresh rescue lending to
expand funds already committed to an anti-crisis firewall to
contain the crisis in  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal . Hungary, the
most indebted eastern member of the European Union, has sought
aid from the IMF and the EU for the second time since 2008.  “We are still of the view that all parties want to sign
the agreement eventually, and thus expect notably lower yields
in the summer to come,” Adam Keszeg, a Budapest-based analyst
at  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , wrote in a research report
today on Hungary’s IMF talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
