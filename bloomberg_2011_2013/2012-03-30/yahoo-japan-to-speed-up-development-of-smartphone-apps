Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689) , operator of the
country’s most-visited web portal, said it plans to accelerate
development of mobile-device applications as the number of
smartphone users rises.  “The one thing I’ve decided is to make smartphones our
priority,” Manabu Miyasaka, 44, who will become chief executive
officer of  Yahoo Japan  on April 1, said in an interview in Tokyo
yesterday. “That market will grow much faster than the
personal-computer market.”  Miyasaka is replacing Masahiro Inoue, 55, as part of a
management overhaul that includes creating a new position to
oversee smartphone services. Shin Murakami, 35, will be chief
mobile officer from April, while Toshiki Ohya, 42, has been
named chief financial officer in a shake-up that will reduce the
average age of Yahoo  Japan ’s top executives to 41 from 50,
according to the company.  Miyasaka called back Murakami, who left the company in
April 2011, to tap his expertise in mobile phones, the incoming
CEO said. Murakami will work across divisions as many customers
use multiple devices, including desktop PCs, tablet PCs and
smartphones, to surf the Internet, Miyasaka said.  Miyasaka, who joined Yahoo Japan in 1997, is currently a
senior vice president in charge of the company’s consumer
business.  Yahoo Inc.’s Stake  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  is in talks to dispose of its stake of about
34.7 percent in Yahoo Japan, a joint venture with  Softbank
Corp. (9984) , the companies have said. Softbank, Japan’s third-largest
mobile-phone operator, has a combined 42 percent  stake  in the
venture, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s no change in the situation, as talks have been
going on,” Miyasaka said.  Yahoo Japan fell 1.6 percent to 26,780 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, compared with a 0.3 percent decline in the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The shares have gained 8
percent this year.  Yahoo Japan profit has increased every fiscal year since it
was founded in 1996, according to the company. Net income will
probably rise as much as 7.6 percent in the year ending March 31
from a year earlier to 99.2 billion yen ($1.2 billion), the
company forecast on Jan. 25. Sales may increase as much as 4.2
percent to 304.6 billion yen, Yahoo Japan said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
