Former Vice President Al Gore’s
Current TV LLC dismissed its lead anchor  Keith Olbermann  after a
year, saying he no longer represented the channel’s values.  Current TV was “founded on the values of respect,
openness, collegiality, and loyalty to our viewers,” Gore and
co-founder  Joel Hyatt  said in a  letter  yesterday to viewers on
the company’s website today. “Unfortunately these values are no
longer reflected in our relationship with Keith Olbermann and we
have ended it.”  The progressive political outlet replaced Olbermann with
former New York Governor  Eliot Spitzer  on a new show,
“Viewpoint with Eliot Spitzer.” Olbermann clashed with
producers at Current TV earlier this year, refusing to anchor
election segments and taking himself off the air.  Olbermann, 53, said on his Twitter account that he plans to
take legal action against the channel.  Current TV’s claims “are untrue and will be proved so in
the legal actions I will be filing against them presently,” he
wrote on  Twitter . “For more than a year I have been imploring
 Al Gore  and Joel Hyatt to resolve our issues internally, while
I’ve been not publicizing my complaints, and keeping the show
alive for the sake of its loyal viewers and even more loyal
staff.”  Current TV has 68.5 million subscribers and an estimated
net operating revenue of $127 million for 2012, according to
researcher SNL Kagan.  Olbermann, who left  MSNBC  in 2011 after serving a two-day
suspension over political donations in November 2010, received
equity in New York-based Current Media, according to a statement
at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
