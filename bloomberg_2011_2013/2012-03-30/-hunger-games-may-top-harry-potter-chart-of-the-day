“The Hunger Games,” with the
third-biggest opening weekend for a movie with $152.5 million
sales, is showing staying power that may allow it to pass the
leader, the final “Harry Potter,” in its theatrical run.  The  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)  picture will probably
show a revenue decline of 54 percent or smaller this weekend,
followed by a 36 percent drop the next week, estimates Monica
Dicenso, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. THE
CHART OF THE DAY shows the pace is similar to 2008’s “The  Dark
Knight ,” which had the second-biggest opening of all time and
generated $533.3 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters.  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s “The Dark Knight” and “The Hunger
Games,” in which teenagers fight to the death on live
television, have mature themes that attract a broad mix of teens
and adults, said  Paul Dergarabedian , president of researcher
Hollywood.com Box Office. “ Harry Potter  and the Deathly
Hallows, Part 2” dropped 72 percent its second weekend because
the audience was narrower, he said.  “The Hunger Games” earned $29.2 million for  Santa Monica ,
California-based Lions Gate this week on March 26, 27 and 28
according to Box Office Mojo. The film accounts for 71 percent
of advance sales on Fandango, said Harry Medved, a spokesman for
the online ticket seller.  Dicenso estimates “The Hunger Games” will generate $350
million at the domestic box office, with a chance to go as high
as $390 million. That would surpass the $381 million that the
final “Harry Potter” film brought for New York-based Time
Warner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
