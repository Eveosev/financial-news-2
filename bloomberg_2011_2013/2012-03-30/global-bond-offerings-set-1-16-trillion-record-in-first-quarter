Bond sales globally have exceeded a
record $1.16 trillion in the first three months of 2012 as moves
by global central banks along with reduced risk from  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis drive credit-market optimism.  Offerings by companies from Europe to  Asia  and the U.S.
have surpassed the previous record of $1.155 trillion reached in
the first quarter of 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Yields on global corporate bonds fell to 4.12 percent
on March 29, within 15 basis points of the lowest yield in
records going back to 1997, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index
data show.  Issuance has climbed as the  Federal Reserve  holds borrowing
 rates  near zero and after the European Central Bank’s Long-Term
Refinancing Operations have supplied more than a trillion euros
($1.3 trillion) of three-year loans to banks since December. The
efforts by the central banks along with the successful
restructuring of Greek bonds have helped improve confidence in
credit markets.  “The success of the Greek PSI and the LTRO programs have
been catalysts for the improved credit market conditions
globally,” Brendan Hanley, a managing director of investment-
grade capital markets at Bank of America Corp., said in an
interview at the lender’s New York office this week. “Increased
fund flows have contributed to the outsized demand for the new
issue calendar.”  Returns on global bonds of 3.92 percent through March are
poised for the best gains since the third quarter of 2010 when
the securities returned 4.33 percent. Yields on the debt reached
a low of 3.99 percent in October of that year, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch Index data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
