Loans provided by Australian banks
and finance companies increased 0.4 percent in February from the
previous month, the nation’s  Reserve Bank  said today.  The median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was for a 0.3 percent monthly advance. Total lending gained
3.5 percent from a year earlier, the central bank said, more
than the median forecast for a 3.3 percent annual increase.  Loans to consumers to buy houses advanced 0.4 percent from
January and 5.3 percent from a year earlier, according to
today’s statement. Credit provided to consumers for purchases
other than housing increased 0.3 percent last month for an
annual drop of 1.1 percent.  Lending to companies rose 0.4 percent from January and
gained 1.2 percent from a year earlier, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
