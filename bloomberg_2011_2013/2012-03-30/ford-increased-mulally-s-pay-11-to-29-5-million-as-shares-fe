Ford Motor Co. (F)  raised Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Mulally ’s 2011 compensation 11 percent to
$29.5 million, while cutting his cash bonus 42 percent for a
year in which the profitable automaker’s stock fell 36 percent.  He received $2 million in salary, $5.46 million in bonus
and $22 million in stock, options and other compensation, the
Dearborn, Michigan-based  company  said today in a  regulatory
filing . The company this month gave Mulally $58.3 million in
stock as part of an incentive plan for 2009 performance.  Mulally, who joined Ford in 2006 from  Boeing Co. (BA) ,
engineered a turnaround by globalizing operations, cutting costs
and adding fuel-efficient models such as the Fiesta subcompact.
Ford fell last year on uncertainty about the global recovery;
the shares have risen 16 percent this year.  “He’s doing a lot better than the shareholders,” said
 Gary Bradshaw , a  fund manager  at Dallas-based Hodges Capital
Management, which owns about 250,000 Ford shares. “He’s done as
good a job as any executive out there, but it’s getting harder
and harder to justify the big salary and big stock options he
gets when the stock isn’t performing.”  Executive Chairman Bill Ford received total compensation of
$14.5 million, down 45 percent from 2010, when he received pay
deferred from 2008 and 2009. For 2011, Bill Ford received $2
million in salary, $1.56 million in bonus and $10.9 million in
stock, option awards and other compensation.  UAW Criticism  United Auto Workers President  Bob King  in July called
Mulally’s compensation “outrageous” and “excessive.” Ford
rewarded Mulally with $56.5 million in stock last year and
boosted his 2010 compensation 48 percent to $26.5 million. For
2010, Mulally was the highest paid person in the global  auto
industry , according to an analysis by Towers Watson & Co., a
U.S. benefits consultant.  Ford has awarded Mulally stock worth more than $100 million
the past two years. His cash bonus was cut for 2011 because Ford
fell short of market share and quality goals. Mulally’s
compensation for last year was still his highest since joining
Ford. The automaker posted operating earnings of $8.8 billion in
2011.  “Our stock has appreciated under his leadership 370
percent over the last three years,” Jay Cooney, a Ford
spokesman, said of Mulally. “Clearly, he’s delivered
 shareholder value .”  Missed Targets  Ford achieved 55 percent of its corporate quality goal,
according to the proxy. Last year, the automaker plunged in
quality rankings by researcher J.D. Power and Associates due in
part to malfunctions with touch-screen dashboard controls on
Ford and Lincoln models.  The automaker also realized just 8 percent of its corporate
market share goal, including achieving 6 percent of the target
of a winning 13.7 percent of the auto market in  North America 
and  South America , according to the proxy.  Bonuses for Ford’s top five executives, including  Bill Ford 
and Mulally, fell in 2011, according to the proxy.  Ford borrowed $23.4 billion in late 2006 after Mulally, 66,
took over as CEO, putting up assets including its blue oval logo
as collateral. That helped the automaker stay out of bankruptcy
in 2009 as the predecessors of General Motors Co. and Chrysler
Group LLC sought court protection and reorganized with U.S. aid.  To win concessions from the UAW in 2009, Mulally and Bill
Ford agreed to 30 percent cuts in their 2009 and 2010 salaries
and to forgo bonuses for 2008 and 2009.  GM, VW CEOs  GM CEO Dan Akerson, whose pay must be approved by the Obama
administration’s special pay master, said Jan. 10  that he won’t
get a cash bonus for 2011, the year the Detroit-based automaker
earned a record profit and again became the world’s largest.  Akerson, who served as CEO for four months in 2010,
received $2.53 million in total compensation for that year,
including a $566,667 salary and $1.96 million in stock awards
and other pay, GM said in a proxy statement last year. His
annual salary was $1.7 million, the filing said.  Volkswagen AG boosted CEO Martin Winterkorn’s 2011
compensation 87 percent to 17.5 million euros ($23.3 million)
for leading the world’s second-largest automaker to a record
profit. Winterkorn’s pay was the highest among CEOs in the 30
companies that comprise  Germany ’s benchmark DAX Index.  Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota  Sergio Marchionne , Chrysler’s CEO, didn’t receive a cash
salary or shares from the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
automaker, according to a company filing March 6. Marchionne is
also CEO of Fiat SpA, which owns 58.5 percent of Chrysler. Fiat
paid him 14.5 million euros in 2011, mostly in stock grants,
according to a March 15 filing.  Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn
received 982 million yen ($11.9 million) in total compensation
for the 2010 fiscal year, including salary and  stock options ,
making him the highest-paid leader among Japanese companies.
Ghosn is also CEO of Renault SA, based in the Paris suburb of
Boulogne Billancourt.  Toyota Motor Corp. President  Akio Toyoda  was paid 136
million yen in the year ended March 31, 2011, including a 24
million yen bonus, according to a filing last year to  Japan ’s
finance ministry.  Ghosn’s pay was lower than the 2010 average for global
automotive companies, estimated at about $15.3 million by Towers
Watson & Co.  Other Ford Executives  Ford Chief Financial Officer  Lewis Booth , who retires April
1, received $7.7 million in total compensation for 2011, less
than the $8.2 million he received a year earlier, the company
said. Booth’s bonus for 2011 fell 47 percent to $1.4 million.
His 2011 compensation also included a $1.25 million salary and
$5.1 million in stock, options and other compensation.  Mark Fields, the company’s president of the Americas,
received total compensation of $8.84 million, more than the
$8.82 million he received a year earlier. Fields’s cash bonus
for 2011 fell 58 percent to $1.5 million. He also received
salary of $1.35 million and $5.99 million in stock, options and
other compensation.  Joe Hinrichs, president of  Ford (F) ’s Asia Pacific and Africa
region, received total compensation of $5.3 million, 40 percent
less than Fields. Hinrichs received a salary of $751,250, bonus
of $925,000 and $3.6 million in stock, options and other
compensation. Fields and Hinrichs are candidates to replace
Mulally when he retires, people familiar with the deliberations
have said.  The company plans to conduct its annual shareholders’
meeting May 10 in Wilmington,  Delaware . Ford slid 0.2 percent to
$12.475 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
