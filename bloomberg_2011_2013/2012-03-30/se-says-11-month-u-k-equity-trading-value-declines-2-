London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) ,
Europe’s oldest independent bourse, reported a 2 percent drop in
11-month average daily U.K. equity trading value as markets were
buffeted by the euro-area debt crisis.  Chief Executive Officer Xavier Rolet has been trying to
diversify LSE’s business away from stocks and stem its loss of
market share to alternative trading systems such as Bats Europe
and Chi-X Europe Ltd. He’s agreed to buy a majority stake in
LCH.Clearnet Ltd., the U.K.’s largest clearing house, after he
was forced to scrap a planned takeover of Canada’s TMX Group
Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
