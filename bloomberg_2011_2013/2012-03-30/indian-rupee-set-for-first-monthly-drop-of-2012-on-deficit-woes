India ’s rupee headed for its first
monthly decline this year amid concern persisting inflation and
the trade deficit will deter foreign investors.  The currency pared its 2012 advance as the central bank
kept  interest rates  unchanged on March 15, citing risks that
gains in wholesale prices will quicken. Finance Minister  Pranab
Mukherjee  said on March 16 the shortfall in India’s current
account will be 3.6 percent of gross domestic product this
fiscal year ending March 31, compared with 2.6 percent in the
previous 12 months. Capital  flows  into Indian equities declined
to an average $100 million a day in March from $270 million in
February, exchange data show.  “Overall, there are trade deficit and outflow concerns,
which are compounding year-end demand for dollars,” said
Priyanka Kishore, a strategist at  Standard Chartered  Plc in
Mumbai. “We are pretty bearish on the rupee.”  The rupee declined 4.2 percent this month to 51.175 per
dollar as of 9:58 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, paring its quarterly advance to 3.7 percent. The
currency gained 0.4 percent today.  Wholesale-price  inflation  accelerated 6.95 percent in
February, according to government data, after slowing to 6.55
percent a month earlier.  India’s economy  probably grew 6.9
percent this fiscal year, the slowest pace since 2009, Mukherjee
said this month. Markets are expecting a cut in the  Reserve Bank 
of India’s repurchase rate at an April 17 review, Standard
Chartered’s Kishore said, which could provide “some relief” to
the rupee.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 9.80 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Three-month offshore non-deliverable forward contracts for
the rupee traded at 52.29 a dollar, compared with 52.40
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
