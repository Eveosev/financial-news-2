Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  will boost
gasoline imports by about a third to 80,000 barrels a day this
year amid rising demand in Brazil, Folha de S. Paulo  reported ,
citing company Refining Director Paulo Roberto Costa.  Gasoline consumption in Brazil rose 36 percent in January

60,000 barrels of gasoline per day in 2011 and 9,000 barrels a
day in 2010, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
