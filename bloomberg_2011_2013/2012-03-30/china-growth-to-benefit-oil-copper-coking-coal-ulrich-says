China’s economy  still offers “good
long-term investment opportunities” and commodities such as
oil, copper and coking coal will benefit, said Jing Ulrich,
chairman of global markets for  China  at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  China’s economy will accelerate after a slowdown in the
first quarter as the government undertakes “nuanced” stimulus,
Ulrich said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in
Cernobbio,  Italy .  “The macro economy can achieve a soft landing,” she said.
“The central government has shifted its policy from fighting
inflation to supporting growth.”  Ulrich said economists and analysts are expecting Chinese
economic growth of 8 percent this year, more than the
government’s 7.5 percent forecast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
