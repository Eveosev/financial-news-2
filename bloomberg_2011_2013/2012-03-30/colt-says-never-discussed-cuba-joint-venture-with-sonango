(Corrects name in headline.)  Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE) 
has never discussed or even considered a joint venture with
Angola’s state-owned oil company Sonangol EP to explore for oil
in Cuba, Cobalt spokeswoman Lynne Hackedorn said.  “Cobalt is a U.S. company and cannot conduct business in
Cuba, per U.S. laws,” Hackedorn said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Novo Jornal reported today, citing an unidentified official
at Sonangol, that the country’s Minister of Economic
Coordination, Manuel Vicente, traveled to Cuba last week to
discuss Sonangol’s access to the island’s oil sector. The
Luanda-based newspaper said Sonangol may seek to carry out a
venture with Cobalt for Cuba.  To contact the reporter on this story:
