Chile ’s peso gained the most among
major Latin American currencies as copper, the country’s main
export, rose and a report showed a surprise decline in Chilean
unemployment.  The peso strengthened 0.8 percent to 485.89 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:15 a.m. in Santiago from 489.82 at yesterday’s close.  The currency extended gains after the National Statistics
Institute reported an unemployment rate of 6.4 percent in the
three months through February compared with the 6.7 percent
median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Chile had
a jobless rate of 6.6 percent through January.  Copper, set for the biggest quarterly gain since 2010, rose
in London as equities and the euro climbed amid speculation
European officials will increase funds for rescuing indebted
nations. Copper for three-month delivery climbed as much as 1.4
percent in  London  today. Prices are up 11 percent this quarter,
the most since the three months through December 2010.  Copper accounts for more than half of Chile’s exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
