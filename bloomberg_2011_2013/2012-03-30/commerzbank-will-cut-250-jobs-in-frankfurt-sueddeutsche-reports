Commerzbank AG (CBK)  plans to cut 250
jobs at its Frankfurt headquarters, 100 of them in investment
banking and 150 in information technology,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported, citing unidentified employee representatives.  The bank, which currently employs 1,800 people in
investment banking, doesnâ€™t expect that part of the business to
regain former levels, the newspaper said. In the IT unit, the
job cuts were already planned, but the lender had reckoned with
more people switching to other companies, Sueddeutsche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
