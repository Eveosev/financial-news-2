Hong Kong   stocks  dropped, sending
the Hang Seng Index down for a third day, as the billionaire co-
chairmen of Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the city’s biggest
developer, were arrested as part of a corruption probe.  Sun Hung Kai plunged 13 percent, its biggest drop since
1998.  Li Ning Co. (2331) ,  China ’s largest maker of sportswear, sank 4.4
percent after profit fell 65 percent.  Industrial & Commercial
Bank of China Ltd.  gained 1.6 percent after the world’s most
profitable lender posted better-than-estimated earnings.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.3 percent to 20,555.58 at the 4
p.m. close in Hong Kong. The gauge dropped 5.2 percent this
month, its first such decline since November, paring gains this
year to 12 percent. The index slid 0.6 percent this week.  “The arrests will have a negative short-term impact on
sentiment,” said  Pauline Dan , Hong Kong-based chief investment
officer at Samsung Investment Trust, which oversees the
equivalent of $72.1 billion in assets.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
listed in the city added 1 percent to 10,640.16 today. Shares
rose on better-than-estimated earnings from banks and
speculation the government will cut excess production capacity
to support companies.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent
today after the index lost 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday. A
report today is expected to show  consumer confidence  in the
world’s biggest economy gained in March.  ‘Sustainability’?  “You just don’t have sustainability for the markets to
reweight higher like they did three or four months ago,” Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the Asia-
Pacific region at Russell Investment Group, which manages about
$150 billion. “You are not going to see any acceleration from
here and you may actually feel a bit of moderation” in the U.S.  Sun Hung Kai Properties (16) , the most-actively traded stock in
Hong Kong today by value, led real estate companies lower,
tumbling 13 percent to HK$96.50. Shares fell after Thomas and
 Raymond Kwok , the company’s co-chairmen, were detained yesterday
by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The brothers
will continue running the developer, and the arrests won’t
affect business operations, Sun Hung Kai said in a statement.  Li Ning, a sports apparel company founded by the former
Olympics gymnastic gold medalist of the same name, sank 4.4
percent to HK$8.26 after  profit  fell to 386 million yuan ($61
million) last year. Analysts expected earnings of 438 million
yuan.  H-Shares Rise  A gauge of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, the so-
called H-shares index, rose today for the first time in three
days. The index declining 11 times in the 12 trading days
through yesterday amid concern China’s economic growth is
slowing.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China  advanced 1.6 percent
to HK$5.01 today after posting a 17 percent increase in fourth-
quarter earnings as loan growth outpaced rising defaults.
Smaller Bank of China climbed 1.6 percent to HK$3.13 after
saying earnings increased 11 percent to 27.9 billion yuan.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  had its biggest quarterly gain since
the period through September 2009 amid signs of strength in the
U.S. recovery and as China lowered lending curbs. Shares in the
Hang Seng Index traded at 10.3 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring this month slid 0.2
percent to 20,500. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  rose 0.3 percent to
20.24, indicating options traders expect a swing of 5.8 percent
in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
