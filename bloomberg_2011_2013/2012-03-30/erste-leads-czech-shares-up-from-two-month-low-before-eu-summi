Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  snapped eight
days of declines in Czech trading, leading a rebound for the
countryâ€™s equity index from a two-month low as euro-region
finance ministers meet to discuss increasing rescue funds.  The stock climbed 1.9 percent to 429 koruna by 11:28 a.m.
in  Prague , after tumbling 9.3 percent in the previous eight
sessions, the longest losing stretch in more than three years.
The  PX (PX)  gauge, where Erste has a 19 percent weighting, rose 0.7
percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
