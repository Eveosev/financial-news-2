Liz Claiborne Inc. (LIZ)  rose the most in
more than five months after the Wall Street Journal reported
that the retailer had held talks with private-equity firms about
a possible buyout at about $20 a share.  The shares climbed 14 percent to $13.45 at 2:08 p.m. in New
York after earlier rising as much as 30 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Oct. 12.  While Liz Claiborne isn’t currently considering a sale,  KKR
& Co. (KKR) , Permira and Warburg Pincus LLC remain interested in
taking the company private, the newspaper reported today, citing
people familiar with the matter.  Jane Randel, a spokeswoman for New York-based Liz
Claiborne, didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
