U.S. stocks  rose this week, with
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index completing the biggest first-
quarter rally since 1998, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said he will keep stimulating the economy and  Europe 
agreed to increase rescue funds.  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  surged 11 percent, leading health-care
stocks to the biggest rally among 10  S&P 500  groups, amid
speculation the U.S.  Supreme Court  won’t eliminate the insurance
mandate while leaving intact other costly provisions in an
industry overhaul.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  climbed 3.8 percent after a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst said the drugmaker may split
itself up.  Red Hat Inc. (RHT)  jumped 15 percent after the software
maker forecast earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent to 1,408.47 and closed at the
highest level since May 2008 on March 26. It advanced 12 percent
during the first quarter, including a 3.1 percent increase in
March. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 131.31 points, or
1 percent, to 13,212.04 this week. The Nasdaq Composite Index
climbed 0.8 percent and surged 19 percent during the quarter,
the most to start a year since 1991.  “The market can continue to rally into May and the early
part of June,”  Jon Fisher , a  fund manager  at Fifth Third Asset
Management in Minneapolis, which oversees about $16 billion of
assets, said in a telephone interview. “You have all that
monetary policy unleashed in the market globally. At the same
time, you got a huge improvement in sentiment. Outlooks for the
rest of the year are going to continue to be positive.”  Fresh Rescue Lending  Equities advanced, with the  S&P 500 (SPX)  rebounding from 2012’s
biggest weekly decline between March 16 and March 23, after
Bernanke said accommodative monetary policy is still needed to
spur jobs. European finance ministers boosted rescue funding by
500 billion euros ($666 billion), bringing the size of the
firewall to 800 billion euros in the latest move to tame the
region’s debt crisis. Reports on U.S. personal spending and
consumer confidence topped economists’ projections.  More than $3.6 trillion has been restored to U.S. equity
values since October amid better-than-estimated earnings and
economic data. The index has climbed 28 percent since Oct. 3,
sending the S&P 500 to 14.6 times reported earnings, close to
the highest  valuation  since July while below the average since
1954 of 16.4.  “We’re getting closer to fair value,”  Ralph Shive , the
South Bend, Indiana-based manager of the $1.65 billion Wasatch-
Large Cap Value Fund, said in a telephone interview. “There is
most likely a correction this year for sure, with the
uncertainties around the world.”  ‘Off the Table’  The S&P 500  Health Care Index (S5HLTH)  rallied 2.7 percent this week
to the highest level since December 2000. The Supreme Court
ended its hearings of the health-care law March 28. The justices
probably will rule in late June on how much of the law must be
thrown out if they decide Congress can’t require Americans to
buy medical insurance.  “We believe that the worst case scenario for managed care
(solely individual mandate struck) is off the table,” Christine Arnold, an analyst with Cowen & Co., wrote in a March 30 note.
“Given a heightened probability that the individual mandate and
related commercial regulations will be struck, we view
commercial managed care stocks as likely relative winners under
the most probable Supreme Court outcome scenarios.”  WellPoint, the largest U.S. health insurer by enrollment,
surged 11 percent, the most since May 2009, to $73.80.  Aetna
Inc. (AET)  climbed 10 percent to $50.16 while  Coventry Health Care
Inc. (CVH)  advanced 10 percent to $35.57.  Pfizer had the biggest rally in the Dow, increasing 3.8
percent to $22.65.  Jami Rubin , a Goldman Sachs analyst, said the
company may further split itself up after selling or spinning
off its animal health and nutrition businesses.  Surprising Demand  Red Hat surged 15 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$59.89. Chief Executive Officer Jim Whitehurst said the company
was surprised by demand for its Red Hat Enterprise Linux
software from corporations preparing to move more applications
to the so-called cloud, where they can be delivered to users
over the Internet. Profit for the current fiscal year will be at
least $1.16 a share, the company projected. Analysts, on
average, estimated $1.15, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Best Buy Co. had the biggest retreat in the S&P 500,
tumbling 14 percent to $23.68. The largest consumer-electronics
retailer said it plans to close 50 stores as sales missed
forecasts.  Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR) , the world’s largest land-rig
contractor, dropped 9.2 percent to $17.49 after announcing plans
to sell as much as $800 million of oil and natural-gas assets
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
