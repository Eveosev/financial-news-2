Banks must push out by July 2013
part of their swaps-trading business from subsidiaries that get
U.S. assistance through  deposit insurance  or the  Federal
Reserve ’s discount lending window, three regulators said.  Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp.
and Citigroup Inc. must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act’s so-
called push-out provision by July 16, 2013, the Fed, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
