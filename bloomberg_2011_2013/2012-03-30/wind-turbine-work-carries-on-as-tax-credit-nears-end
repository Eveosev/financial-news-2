Sam Courtney, installation supervisor for Wind Turbines of  Ohio  LLC, unbolts the tail section of a wind turbine tower taken down for repairs yesterday at the KMC Sportsman Lodge in Gurnsey County, Ohio. Wind farm developers installed 6,810 megawatts of turbines in the U.S. last year, 31 percent more than in 2010, as they rushed to qualify for a expiring U.S. tax grants. That's enough to power more than  5 million homes . The biggest tax credit for wind power is due to end Dec. 31. If it's allowed to lapse, installations of turbines in the U.S. may fall as much as 95 percent to 500 megawatts in 2013 from this year, according to estimates by  Bloomberg New Energy Finance .
