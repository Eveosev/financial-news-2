  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) , maker
of the Subaru brand of cars, agreed to sell its wind-turbine
business to  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , an electronics and industrial
machinery manufacturer.  The companies will begin discussions on the specific terms
of the agreement and plan to complete the sale by July 1, they
said today in a joint  statement.  Hitachi will pay about 1
billion yen ($12 million) to acquire the business, its spokesman
Yuki Maeda said by phone.  The company posted about 27 billion yen in sales from the
wind business for the year ended March 2011, he said. Fuji
Heavy’s revenue from the segment was about 5 billion yen during
the same period, its spokesman Kenta Matsumoto said by phone.  Japan  is gearing up for more clean energy following the
nuclear accident at Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant last year.
“Specifically in the area of wind power generation systems,
further introduction and expansion in Japan is widely
predicted,” the companies said in the statement.  The two companies together developed a 2-megawatt downwind
type power generation system in 2003 and a total of 25 units
have been delivered to six sites in Japan, according to the
statement.  Hitachi plans to consolidate the resources of the two
companies “to enhance the design and development capability,
and integrate the manufacturing and distribution,” they said in
the statement. Fuji Heavy will focus on its other divisions,
including Subaru, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
