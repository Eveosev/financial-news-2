Cocoa production in  Ivory Coast  and
Ghana, the world’s two top suppliers, will fall this year
because of dry weather in both countries and a civil war in
Ivory Coast, the International Cocoa Organization said.  Global cocoa production in the 2011-2012 growing season
will be 71,000 metric tons short of demand, unchanged from the
February forecast, Jean-Marc Anga, the group’s executive
director, told reporters today in Guayaquil, Ecuador, at the
close of ICCO’s annual meeting.  A five-month conflict in Ivory Coast, following a disputed
presidential election in November 2010, led to a cocoa-export
ban which drove prices to a 32-year high in March 2011. Dry
weather in the two West African nations is adding to supply
problems, Anga said today.  Ivory Coast is “highly unlikely to meet the same level
this year,” Anga said. “The same with production in
neighboring country  Ghana , they are affected by the same
climatic conditions and production will also go down.”  Cocoa production in Ivory Coast will decline to about 1.3
million metric tons during the season after reaching a record
1.56 million tons a year earlier, Anga said. Output in Ghana
will be 970,000 tons. The harvest in  Indonesia , the world’s
third-biggest producer, should reach 500,000 tons.  The ICCO is “very optimistic” about demand for the bean,
as well as cocoa butter and powder, as consumption increases in
 emerging markets  including China and  India , Anga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
