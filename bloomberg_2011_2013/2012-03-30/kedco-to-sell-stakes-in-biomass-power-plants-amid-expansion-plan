Kedco Plc (KED) , an Irish developer of
power from wood and waste, received approaches from companies
seeking stakes in its projects as it adds biomass plants in
the U.K.  British and international companies are interested in
buying equity stakes in its assets, Chief Executive Officer
Gerard Madden said by telephone. Kedco intends to retain
“significant equity” in any project it builds, owns and
operates, he said.  The Cork-based company plans to build five biomass plants
in the U.K. for 59 million pounds ($94 million), funded with
about 70 percent debt and the rest equity. It’s among clean-
power developers expanding in Britain as the country seeks to
get 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. The
government estimates as much as half of that may be generated
from biomass, which includes municipal waste, wood and straw.  Potential investors range from private-equity firms to
industrial companies already involved in the biomass business,
Madden said yesterday. Those companies may want to deploy their
own technology or expertise as well as taking an equity stake,
according to the CEO.  Kedco is working on a project in Newry in Ireland, another
in  London , two in Derbyshire in northern  England  and a fifth in
southern England. It’s seeking to conclude financing for its 45
million-pound London venture by the third quarter. The Newry
site is already financed, having received a 9.44 million-pound
loan from  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s Ulster Bank unit in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
