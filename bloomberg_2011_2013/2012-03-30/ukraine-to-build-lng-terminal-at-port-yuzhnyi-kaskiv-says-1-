Ukraine will build an 846 million-
euro ($1.13 billion) liquefied natural gas terminal at the port
of Yuzhnyi, said Vladyslav Kaskiv, the head of state national
projects.  As much as 70 percent of the cost will come from borrowing,
Kaskiv told reporters in Kiev today, adding that 513 million
euros will be raised by bond issues or from a loan.  The government will set up a managing company with a
private investor within two months, Kaskiv said. Direct
financing from the Ukrainian government will total 55 million
euros, he said.  The terminal will be completed in two stages, and capacity
will double to 10 billion cubic meters by 2018 from a planned 5
billion cubic meters in 2016, he said. Total construction time
will be 49 months, he said.  Another 113 million euros will be needed to build a
pipeline link to carry the fuel from the terminal to consumers,
according to Kaskiv.  To contact the reporter on this story:
