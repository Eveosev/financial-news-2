Asian currencies rose this quarter,
led by  India ’s rupee and the Malaysian ringgit, as the world’s
fastest economic growth attracted funds to regional assets.  Stock markets in  South Korea , India and Taiwan together
attracted some $24 billion of overseas funds this year, exchange
data show.  Asia ’s developing economies will expand 7.3 percent
this year, outpacing growth of 3.6 percent in Latin America and
1.8 percent in the U.S., according to International Monetary
Fund projections published in January. The euro area is forecast
to contract 0.5 percent.  The rupee strengthened 4.3 percent this quarter to 50.88
per dollar in Mumbai, the best performance since mid-2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ringgit climbed 3.7
percent to 3.0598, the biggest gain since the third quarter of
2010.  Thailand ’s baht rose 2.3 percent to 30.85, after sliding
1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 as the nation’s worst
floods in almost 70 years shut factories.  “Funds are flowing into this region, supporting
currencies,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based trader at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “The pace of appreciation may not
be so fast for the baht next quarter as companies may need to
buy the dollar to purchase machines destroyed by the floods.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, climbed
1.5 percent this quarter, the biggest gain since December 2010.
The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of shares rose 11 percent.  Stock Inflows  In  Malaysia , overseas investors bought 1.3 billion ringgit
($425 million) more local shares than they sold in January and a
net 200 million ringgit in February, exchange data show. The
economy is forecast to grow as much as 5 percent this year after
expanding 5.1 percent in 2011, the central bank said in its
annual report released March 21.  “The ringgit is in demand because of portfolio inflows, a
sign that the Malaysian economy will be able to sustain
growth,” said Calbert Loh, the Kuala Lumpur-based head of
treasury at Bangkok Bank Bhd. “The currency is on a
strengthening trend and could test 3.03 to the dollar in the
near term.”  International investors poured a net $2.7 billion into Thai
equities this year and $9.9 billion into government debt,
according to data from the stock exchange and the Thai Bond
Market Association. Gross domestic product will rise between 5
percent and 6 percent this year, the  Finance Ministry   said  this
week. The $319 billion economy expanded 0.1 percent last year,
the least since 2009, amid the flooding.  Improving Economy  The won had a second quarterly advance as Bank of Korea
official Kim Young Bae said in  Seoul  yesterday gross domestic
product will increase more than forecast in the first quarter.
The won strengthened 1.7 percent since December to 1,133.10 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Global investors bought $9.6 billion more Korean shares
than they sold since Dec. 31, the biggest net inflows since
September 2009, exchange data show.  “The won is likely to strengthen further as the economic
recovery gathers pace from later in the second quarter,” said
Kim Sung Soon, chief currency dealer at state-run Industrial
Bank of  Korea  in Seoul. “Net foreign buying of stocks is also
providing good support for the won.”  Possible Upgrade  The Philippine peso rallied this quarter by the most since
September 2010 as speculation the nation will receive a credit-
rating upgrade buoyed demand for Philippine assets. Assistant
Governor Cyd Amador said on March 29 the central bank is seeing
“modest, manageable” inflation and a pause in the current
cycle of interest-rate cuts is “on the table.”  “There are no more rate cuts in the offing and to that
effect it is positive for the currency,” said Radhika Rao, an
economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “They are not going to
narrow the rate differential over the dollar any further.
Inflows will remain positive.”  The peso advanced 2.2 percent this quarter to 42.92 per
dollar in  Manila .  Elsewhere,  China ’s yuan weakened 0.06 percent this quarter
to 6.2980 per dollar and  Taiwan ’s dollar gained 2.6 percent to
NT$29.530. Indonesia’s rupiah fell 1.1 percent to 9,165, a third
quarterly loss.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
