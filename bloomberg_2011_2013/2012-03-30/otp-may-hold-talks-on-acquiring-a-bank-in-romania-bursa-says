OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s biggest
lender, doesn’t rule out talks this year on buying a bank in
Romania, Bursa  reported , citing Deputy Chief Executive Officer
Laszlo Wolf.  OTP may buy a smaller “good quality” bank to increase its
Romanian market share; previous talks about acquisitions in the
country failed because sellers “overvalued their assets,” the
newspaper cited Wolf as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
