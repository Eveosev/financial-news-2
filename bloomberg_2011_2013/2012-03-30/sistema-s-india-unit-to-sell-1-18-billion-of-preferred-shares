Sistema Shyam TeleServices Ltd.,
the Indian mobile phone venture controlled by Russian
billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s  AFK Sistema (SSA) , will sell 60
billion rupees ($1.18 billion) of preferred shares, doubling its
authorized capital.  The non-convertible share issue will not change the voting
structure of the unit, the Moscow-based company said in a
regulatory filing today following a shareholder’s meeting.
Sistema holds 57 percent of Sistema Shyam.  India ’s Supreme court last month canceled 21 licenses that
the unit won in 2008 as part of a probe into the auctions.
Sistema, which says the company has invested more than $3.1
billion, called on the Russian and Indian government to help
settle the dispute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
