Panoro Minerals Ltd. (PML)  extended the
biggest gain this quarter among stocks trading in Latin American
equity indexes as investors bet it will develop one of its
copper and gold deposits and copper prices rose.  The Canadian exploration company rose 1.3 percent to 77
cents at the close of trading in  Lima , pushing its first-quarter
surge to 111 percent. That’s the best performance among 469
stocks in Latin American indexes tracked by Bloomberg.  “The company has raised enough money to finance its
projects and it has good shareholders who have given it
stability,” said Carlos Rojas, a trader at Andino Asset
Management SAC. “Investors expect the company will generate
further value once one of their projects becomes a reality.”  Vancouver-based Panoro, which raised $13.8 million from a
private placement this month, may sell one of its Peruvian
properties this year, country manager Christian Pilon said in a
Nov. 16 interview. Copper rose as much as 1.5 percent in  New
York  today and has climbed 11 percent this year after slumping
20 percent last year.  Panoro said March 21 it discovered more copper and gold ore
at its Cotabambas property in the southern Andes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
