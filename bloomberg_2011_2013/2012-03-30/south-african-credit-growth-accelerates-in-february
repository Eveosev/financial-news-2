South African credit growth
accelerated at its fastest pace in more than two years in
February as the central bank kept  interest rates  low and the
recovery in  Africa ’s largest economy strengthened.  Borrowing (SACEIYY)  by households and businesses rose 7.9 percent
from 7.3 percent in January, the Pretoria-based Reserve Bank
said on its website today. The median  estimate  in a Bloomberg
survey of 15 economists was for credit to expand 7 percent.  The Reserve Bank held its benchmark lending rate at 5.5
percent yesterday, the lowest level in more than 30 years, to
support the economy as inflation slows. Governor Gill Marcus
said the bank will monitor whether price pressures spread as
spending picks up.  “We are seeing a little bit stronger growth on the
corporate side,” Dennis Dykes, an economist for Nedbank Group
Ltd., said in a telephone interview. “If it continues at this
rate, that is something the  Reserve Bank  will be watching.”  The rand rose 0.3 percent to 7.76965 against the dollar at
9:01 a.m. in Johannesburg. The yield on the benchmark rand debt
due in 2015 fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
6.78 percent.  Low interest rates helped to boost spending in the economy
by an annualized 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the fastest
pace in more than a year, the central bank said on March 19. The
economy will probably expand 3 percent this year, up from an
earlier estimate of 2.8 percent, the bank said yesterday.  Inflation (SACPIYOY)  slowed to 6.1 percent in February, staying above
the bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range.  The broad  M3 (SAMYM3Y)  measure of  money supply  rose 5.9 percent in
February from a year earlier, compared with a revised 6.7
percent in January, the central bank said. The median  estimate 
in a Bloomberg survey was 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
