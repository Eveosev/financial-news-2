The  World Bank  plans to pick its
new president April 16 after interviewing the three candidates
for the post the previous week, according to three officials at
the lender’s board.  Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is scheduled
to meet the 25-person board April 9, according to the officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity because the dates haven’t
been made public. Former Colombian finance minister Jose Antonio Ocampo is to be interviewed on April 10, followed by the U.S.
candidate, Dartmouth College President Jim Yong Kim on April 11,
the officials said.  The new president will succeed  Robert Zoellick , whose term
ends June 30. The U.S. is the bank’s largest shareholder, and an
American has always held the top job. The bank had previously
said it would make a decision by April 20.  World Bank spokesman Frederick Jones declined to comment
because the selection process is decided by the board.  In a letter to the other governors of the 187-country World
Bank this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner 
sought support for Kim, a physician and a specialist on
HIV/AIDS, and stressed his understanding of the World Bank’s
responsibilities beyond his area of expertise.  The new president will take over an institution that lent
$57 billion last year, as private investors step up their
funding for development projects, turning the World Bank into
more of a technical adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
