Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
 Japan ’s biggest lender, is considering spending “several
billion” dollars to buy a U.S. regional bank, incoming bank
unit President Nobuyuki Hirano said.  The company is searching for targets mainly on the west
coast to expand its commercial banking operations, Hirano, who
became head of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. on April 1,
said in an interview.  Mitsubishi UFJ accelerated its growth in the U.S. with the
acquisition of a 22 percent stake in  Morgan Stanley (MS)  last year
and San Francisco-based  UnionBanCal Corp. (UB)  in 2008, helping to
counter sluggish  loan demand  at home. The Japanese bank’s west
coast presence widened in March with a $1.5 billion deal to buy
 Santa Barbara , California-based  Pacific Capital Bancorp. (PCBC)   “We are increasing the reach of our global commercial
banking, that’s our core business,” said Hirano, who will take
the bank’s management duties from group President Katsunori Nagayasu. “For  investment banking , we have Morgan Stanley,”
Hirano said in the March 26 interview.  Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ rose as much as 2.7 percent to 423
yen in Tokyo Stock Exchange trading today. They have gained 25
percent this year outpacing the benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average (NKY) ’s 19 percent increase.  Domestic Demand Wanes  Mitsubishi UFJ boosted overseas lending 9.6 percent to 18.2
trillion yen ($221 billion) as of Dec. 31 from 16.6 trillion yen
in March 2010, the bank said in February. Corporate lending at
home declined 8.8 percent to 43.5 trillion yen during the same
period, dragging total loans down to 80.9 trillion yen from 85
trillion yen, data compiled by the bank show.  “After going through two financial crises in three years
and weathering Japan’s biggest earthquake last year, I am set to
lead the bank on a path of growth and evolution,” Hirano said.
He joined the bank’s predecessor in 1974 before it merged with
Bank of Tokyo Ltd. in 1996, and then with UFJ Bank Ltd. in 2005,
according to its website.  Mitsubishi UFJ acquired its Morgan Stanley stake when it
invested $9 billion in the company in October 2008, as the New
York-based firm’s stock price tumbled in the wake of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse. Hirano served on Morgan
Stanley’s board from March 2009 to May 2011.  The Japanese bank exchanged $7.8 billion of Morgan Stanley
convertible preferred stock for common  shares (8306)  in June 2011,
making it the lender’s biggest common shareholder.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-
biggest bank by market value, is also looking abroad for growth.
The company in January agreed to buy  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc ’s aviation division for $7.3 billion, following a 590
million euro ($787 million) deal to buy project-finance loans
from  Bank of Ireland  in November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
