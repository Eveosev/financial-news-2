Finland said it may sell a new euro
benchmark note in the second half of the year.  Finlandâ€™s gross borrowing in 2012 is estimated at 21
billion euros ($28 billion), the Treasury said in an e-mailed
statement. It will also sell more of its existing debt in as
many as two tap auctions in the second quarter.  The country said it will explore selling a U.S. dollar bond
in the second quarter or second half of the year.  Finland, one of the only four AAA rated euro members, last
week unveiled 2.7 billion euros of austerity measures to balance
the budget, which the government aims to do by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
