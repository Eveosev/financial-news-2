rose 0.3 percent to 1,589.0791.  CRUDE OIL  Oil advanced in  New York , heading for a second quarterly

inventories rose 57 billion cubic feet in the week ended March

weather and record production have sent prices down 29 percent

poised to end quarter as the best performer among the six
industrial metals on limited supplies.  Three-month copper rose as much as 1.1 percent to $8,440 a

will rise as production declines in  South America .  The May-delivery  contract climbed as much as 0.5 percent
to $13.6275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures

dropped last month, raising concern demand may weaken for the
commodity used in tires.  September-delivery rubber lost 1 percent to end at 325.7
yen a kilogram ($3,966 a metric ton), the lowest settlement
level since March 7, on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The most-
