Compensation for the highest-paid
U.S. hedge-fund managers plunged 35 percent in 2011 to $14.4
billion after the European sovereign debt crisis pushed the
industry to its second-worst year ever, a survey showed.  Average pay for the 25 top earners was $576 million last
year, down from $883 million in 2010, according to an annual
ranking published by AR  Magazine . In 2009, the figure stood at
$1.1 billion.  Ray Dalio , chief investment officer of Westport,
Connecticut-based Bridgewater Associates LP, topped the list
with $3.9 billion as his biggest pool, Pure Alpha, gained 16
percent, AR Magazine said.  John Paulson , whose $4.9 billion of
pay made him the highest-paid hedge fund manager in 2010, fell
off ARâ€™s list for 2011. His New York-based Paulson & Co. posted
a record 51 percent loss in one of its biggest funds last year.  Hedge funds posted an average decline of  5.3 percent  last
year, a negative annual performance exceeded only by the 19
percent drop in 2008, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.
Concern  Greece  would fail to restructure its debt and that the
U.S. would slip back into recession fueled market volatility.  Bridgewater, which manages $70 billion of hedge fund
assets, uses a macro strategy to try to profit from economic
trends. It profited last year by predicting global economic
headwinds would trigger a flight by other investors to safer
assets such as U.S. Treasuries and German bunds. Dalio, 62, has
earned $8 billion over the past two years, AR Magazine said.  Icahn, Simons  Second on the list was billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , 76,
of Icahn Capital LP, who made $2.5 billion last year, according
to the magazine. Icahn, who returned all outside money in his
hedge funds to clients last April, profited from his investment
in El Paso Corp. after Kinder Morgan Inc. agreed to buy the
natural-gas pipeline company.  Jim Simons , 73, of Renaissance Technologies Corp. in East
Setauket,  New York , ranked third after earning $2.1 billion in
2011, according to AR Magazine.  Eleven hedge fund managers were placed on the AR Magazine
list of 25 highest earners even though their firms posted
single-digit investment returns. The publication attributed this
to managers benefitting from fees charged to investors and to
managers putting their own assets in their hedge funds.  Steve Cohen , founder of  Stamford , Connecticut-based SAC
Capital Advisors LP, earned $585 million after his main hedge
fund gained 8 percent and  Paul Tudor Jones  made $175 million
after his main fund rose 3 percent, the magazine said.  The following table shows the highest-paid U.S. hedge-fund
managers, according to the report:  To contact the reporter on this story:
