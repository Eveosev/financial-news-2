Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the biggest exporter
of coal for power stations, paid Chief Executive Officer  Mick Davis  $5.4 million in salary, bonuses and benefits last year,
the company’s annual report shows.  Davis’s remuneration included $2.29 million in salary and
fees and a $2.26 million cash bonus. The figure is 13 percent
higher than in 2010, excluding a $4.29 million deferred bonus
paid to Davis that year.  Davis, 54, would be CEO of a combined Xstrata- Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  should their proposed merger, announced Feb.
7, proceed. Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg is set to be deputy CEO
and president of the combined company.  Xstrata, based in Zug,  Switzerland , posted a 12 percent
gain in net income before one-time items to $5.79 billion last
year. Its shares dropped 36 percent in London trading.  Chief Financial Officer Trevor Reid’s total payments were
$2.55 million, including salary and fees of $1.2 million and a
$1.18 million cash bonus. That’s an increase of 11 percent on
2010, if his deferred bonus of $2.16 million paid that year is
excluded. The figures are converted from payments made in
pounds, Xstrata said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
