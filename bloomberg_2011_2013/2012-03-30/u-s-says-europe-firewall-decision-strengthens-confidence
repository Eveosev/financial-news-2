Europe ’s decision on a financial
rescue fund will “strengthen confidence,” the  U.S. Treasury 
said today in a statement.  “Today’s announcement by the Eurogroup reinforces a
trajectory of positive efforts to strengthen confidence in the
euro area,” the Treasury said in  Washington .  European governments capped fresh rescue lending at 500
billion euros ($666 billion), after a Germany-led coalition
opposed a further expansion of the region’s anti-crisis
firewall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
