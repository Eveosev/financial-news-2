     March 30 (Bloomberg) -- MasterCard Inc., the second-biggest
payments network, said it’s investigating a potential breach of
account data and that card issuers and  law enforcement  have been
notified.  Data may have been targeted at a “U.S.-based entity,” and
MasterCard’s own systems “have not been compromised in any
manner,” the Purchase, New York-based company said today in an
e-mailed statement. It didn’t specify how many accounts may have
been affected.  “The incident is currently the subject of an ongoing
forensic review by an independent data-security organization,”
it said. “MasterCard is concerned whenever there is any
possibility that cardholders could be inconvenienced and we
continue to both monitor this event and take steps to safeguard
account information.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
