Australia ’s banking regulator has
rejected calls from the nation’s lenders to amend the way it
plans to locally administer proposed global capital rules.  The  Australian Prudential Regulation Authority  “is not
intending to change its broad approach to the implementation of
the Basel III reforms,” the organization said in an emailed
statement today in response to 13 submissions from lenders.  The Sydney-based regulator said a common theme in the
submissions was concern that APRA’s proposals would give some
banks a lower headline capital ratio than lenders in other
countries. APRA, which supervises financial companies overseeing
A$4 trillion ($4.2 trillion) in assets for almost 23 million
Australian customers, also said it will proceed with a plan to
accelerate some of its Basel implementation timetable.  “Some concerns were raised that APRA’s more conservative
stance in some areas would disadvantage authorized deposit-
taking institutions in international comparisons of  capital
ratios ,” Chairman John Laker said in today’s statement.
“However, APRA saw no strong in-principle arguments to move
away from its traditional conservative stance, which is widely
recognized and has served the Australian banking system well.”  APRA also said a common system of disclosure for capital
ratios is being considered by the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  that will, “if adopted, facilitate international
comparisons.”  Steven Munchenberg, chief executive officer of the
Australian Bankers’ Association, said the nation’s banks are
“well placed” to meet the new  capital requirements .  “But we should make sure that progress to compliance with
the Basel III standards is in line with our major trading and
financial partners, and that the measurement of compliance
facilitates comparisons with other banks globally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
