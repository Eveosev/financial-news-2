Mark Zuckerberg , chief executive
officer of Facebook Inc., won approval from U.S. antitrust
authorities for a transaction that a person familiar with the
matter said involves the exercise of stock options he’ll receive
from the company’s initial public offering.  The social network’s chief executive disclosed in a company
filing Feb. 1 that he plans to exercise options for 120 million
shares with the initial public offering. Facebook said in its
IPO prospectus last month that Zuckerberg plans to use proceeds
from a share sale to pay taxes he will owe on the exercise of
the options.  Facebook spokesman Jonathan Thaw declined to comment. The
person who said the transaction involves Zuckerberg’s  stock
options  declined to be identified because he wasn’t authorized
to speak publicly about the matter.  All transactions of more than $68.2 million must be
reported to antitrust regulators for review by law. The U.S.
Federal Trade Commission today announced the plan was approved
without identifying the nature of the transaction.  The value of the Menlo Park, California-based company
could be from $75 billion to $100 billion, two people familiar
with the matter told Bloomberg in January. Based on that
valuation, Zuckerberg’s stock options could reach almost $5
billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
