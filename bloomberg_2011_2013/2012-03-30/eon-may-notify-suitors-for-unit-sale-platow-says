EON AG (EOAN)  may give feedback next week
to bidders for its energy-from-waste unit on their offers, which
valued the business at as much as 2 billion euros ($2.7
billion),  Platow Brief  reported, without citing anyone.  MVV Energie AG (MVV1)  has teamed up with EQT Partners AB to bid,
in competition with  Morgan Stanley (MS) â€™s infrastructure fund and GP
Guenter Papenburg AG, the German newsletter said. Remondis AG
has established a joint venture with German municipalities to
counter potential antitrust concerns over its possible purchase
of the unit of Dusseldorf-based EON, Platow reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
