Kenya’s shilling weakened the most
in seven weeks on increased dollar demand by oil importers
seeking to place orders for the new month.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 1 percent to 83.24 per dollar and traded 0.8 percent
weaker at 83.11 as of 11:28 a.m. in Nairobi. A close at this
level would be the biggest slide since Feb 9.  “The shilling is under pressure as buyers from the energy
sector continue to accumulate dollars ahead of the new month for
placement of their orders,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at
Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC)  won a tender to supply Kenya Petroleum
Refineries Ltd. with a single cargo of 610,000 barrels of Murban
crude oil in May, it said in an e-mailed statement on March 22.  The  inflation rate  declined for a fourth month to 15.61
percent in March from 16.69 percent in the previous month, the
Nairobi-based  Kenya  National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-
mailed statement today. The central bank left its key lending
rate at a record high of 18 percent for a third month after
increasing it six times last year to keep the inflation rate
under check and support the shilling. The Kenyan currency has
gained 28 percent since reaching a record low in October, the
best performer among more than 170 currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The bank’s monetary policy committee will meet on April 4.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.5 percent to 1,593.5 per
dollar, the biggest drop in more than two months. The Ugandan
shilling remained unchanged at 2,515 per dollar. The central
bank monetary policy committee will announce its benchmark rate
today.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Ash Kumar  To contact the reporter on this story:
