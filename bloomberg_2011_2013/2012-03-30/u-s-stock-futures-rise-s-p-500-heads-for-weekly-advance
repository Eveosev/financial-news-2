U.S. stocks rose, extending the
biggest first-quarter advance since 1998 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, as stronger-than-forecast growth in consumer
sentiment and spending bolstered optimism in the economy.  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  and Dow Chemical Co. advanced more than 1.2
percent to pace gains in commodity producers.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ,
the largest U.S. entertainment company by market value, climbed
1.8 percent after Lazard Ltd. raised its recommendation for the
shares.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , which has surged 48 percent in the first
three months of 2012, retreated 1.7 percent today.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.4 percent to 1,408.47 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time, extending its quarterly rally to 12 percent. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average increased 66.22 points, or 0.5 percent,
to 13,212.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.1 percent to
3,091.57. The measure still posted the biggest first-quarter
gain since  1991 (CCMP) , surging 19 percent. The Russell 2000 Index of
small companies declined 0.2 percent to 830.30 today.  “There’s no reason to avoid equities just because they’ve
gone up a lot,” said  David Kelly , who helps oversee about $394
billion as chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New
York. “People are less fearful of a global financial meltdown
emanating from  Europe . If you look at valuations and the
potential for economic growth, those things tell me the market
should have room to move higher over the next few years.”  More than $3.6 trillion was restored to U.S. equity values
since the S&P 500 reached last year’s low in October as the
index surged 28 percent amid better-than-estimated economic
data. It trades at 14.6 times reported earnings, the highest
valuation since July while below the average since 1954 of 16.4.  Monthly Gains  The S&P 500 rose 3.1 percent in  March (SPX) , rallying for a
fourth straight month. The Dow added 2 percent since the end of
February, posting a sixth month of gains. Both capped the
longest stretches of monthly rallies since 2009.  Over the last  100 years , the Dow advanced 1.3 percent on
average in  April (INDU)  and gained 57 percent of the time, according to
data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group. The index rose an
average 2.1 percent in April over the last 50 years and 2.9
percent in the past 20 years, the data showed, marking the best
month for the Dow in both time frames.  Stocks rose today as Americans increased their spending by
the most in seven months, Commerce Department data showed.
Another report showed that the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan’s final index of  consumer sentiment  climbed to 76.2,
the highest since February 2011, from 75.3 last month.  European (SXXP) 
governments capped fresh rescue lending at 500 billion euros
($666 billion), after a Germany-led coalition opposed a further
expansion of the firewall.  Biggest Gains  Nine out of  10 groups  in the S&P 500 rose today as energy,
health-care and consumer-staple companies had the biggest gains.
Twenty-seven out of 30 companies in the Dow advanced.  Commodity shares gained as the S&P GSCI index of raw
materials added 0.7 percent. Halliburton, the world’s largest
provider of hydraulic-fracturing services, rose 1.3 percent to
$33.19. Dow Chemical, the biggest U.S. chemical maker, increased
1.4 percent to $34.64.  Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)  climbed 3 percent to $31.17. The 4.8
percent drop in the oil and gas company’s  shares  yesterday after
the occurrence of a flash fire at the Williams Partners LP-
operated Lathrop compressor station in  Pennsylvania  was
“overblown,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a note.  Disney added 1.8 percent, the biggest advance in the Dow,
to $43.78 after Lazard raised its  recommendation  for the shares
to buy from neutral.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  jumped 7.1 percent to $14.70. The
maker of BlackBerry smartphones said it plans to refocus on the
business market and review strategic options after struggling to
compete against Android devices and Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  Heart Risk  Vivus Inc. (VVUS)  gained 5.1 percent to $22.36 and  Arena
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA)  rose 1.2 percent to $3.08. The
biopharmaceutical companies, which are competing to win U.S.
regulatory approval for weight-loss treatments, probably won’t
be affected by an advisory panel’s recommendation for heart-risk
studies, a Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman said.  Financial shares, which had the biggest gain in the S&P 500
among 10 groups this quarter, swung between gains and losses
today before closing 0.5 percent high. The KBW Bank Index rose
0.3 percent today, after falling as much as 0.8 percent earlier.  Technology shares, which comprise 21 percent of the S&P
500, had the only decline among 10 industries today. The group
had the second-biggest advance in the S&P 500 this quarter,
surging 21 percent.  Apple, the most valuable  technology (S5INFT)  company, lost 1.7
percent to $599.55. An audit of Foxconn Technology Group, the
biggest maker of Apple devices, found “serious and pressing”
violations of Chinese  labor laws , prompting the company to
pledge to cut working hours and give employees more oversight.  Exceeding Estimates  The S&P 500 ended the first quarter 3.4 percent above the
1,362 mean year-end projection of strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The index slumped 0.9 percent over the previous three
days on concern this year’s rally has outpaced prospects for
economic growth.  “The best of 2012 is probably behind us,” Alan Brown,
chief investment officer at Schroders Plc, said in a telephone
interview from  London . His firm oversees $291 billion. “We’ve
had a very substantial rally. I’m not sure where the fresh round
of good news comes from that we haven’t already discounted in
today’s prices. I’m rather more cautious at the present time.”  Shrinking Margins  Profit margins are poised to start falling in the U.S. as
they have worldwide, according to  Pierre Lapointe , Brockhouse &
Cooper Inc.’s global macro strategist. Shrinking margins may
weigh on  earnings  in the next few quarters and hurt stocks, the
report said.  S&P 500  margins have narrowed by 0.2 percentage point this
year, to 13.8 percent. The comparable declines for companies in
in the  European (SXXP)  and Japanese benchmarks are 2 points and 0.9
point, respectively.  “Corporate America can no longer rely on cost-cutting,”
Lapointe wrote in a report with colleagues Alex Bellefleur and
Frances Donald. “The only way to grow the bottom line will be
to grow the top line” by increasing sales, the Montreal-based
strategist wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
