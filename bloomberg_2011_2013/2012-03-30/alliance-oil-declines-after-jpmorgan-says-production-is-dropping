  Alliance Oil Co., (AOIL)  a Stockholm-
listed producer and refiner that operates in Russia, fell the
most in seven months after  JPMorgan & Co. (JPM)  said production has
slipped.  Shares declined 6.6 percent in Stockholm, the most since
Aug. 19. The company’s output fell 9 percent in the first two
months of the year from the fourth quarter, led by the
Kolvinskoye field, JPMorgan analyst Andrey Gromadin said, citing
statistics from InfoTEK.  “If the field production problems are not fixed quickly
enough, it would mean a material downside to this year’s
upstream targets,” Gromadin wrote in a e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
