Nigeria ’s naira strengthened,
heading for the best quarter since 2007, after foreign investors
bought the nation’s debt and on speculation oil companies will
make month-end dollar sales to lenders.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer appreciated
0.1 percent to 157.67 per dollar as of 1.15 p.m. in Lagos, the
