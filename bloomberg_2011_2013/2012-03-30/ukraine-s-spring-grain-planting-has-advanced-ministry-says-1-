Farmers in Ukraine have planted
917,000 hectares (2.3 million acres) of spring grains to date,
the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  That compares with 638,000 hectares during the same period
last year, the Kiev-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today. Wheat accounted for 93,000 hectares and barley for
621,000 hectares.  Farmers need to finish planting wheat and barley by April 5
in the south and by April 12 in the rest of the country, Tetiana Adamenko, the head of the Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Center’s
agro-meteorology department, said by phone from Kiev today.  Farmers have started sowing sunflower seeds and sugar beet,
according to the ministry’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
