Vietnam ’s two-year government bonds
rose the most in a month after the economy expanded at its
slowest pace since 2009, fueling speculation the central bank
will cut  interest rates . The dong was little changed.  Gross domestic product  increased 4 percent in the three
months through March from a year earlier, the General Statistics
Office said yesterday. Slowing inflation may allow the nation to
lower borrowing costs by 100 basis points per quarter, central
bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh said March 12. Consumer prices
 climbed 14.15 percent  this month from a year earlier, the
smallest gain in a year, government data showed March 24.  “Inflation is coming down and growth was a huge
disappointment,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “The central bank will
continue the rate-cutting cycle.”  The  yield  on two-year notes fell 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 11.49 percent, the biggest drop since Feb.
29, according to daily fixings from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate dropped 103 basis points this quarter.  The dong traded at 20,833 per dollar as of 2:45 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,825 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has gained 1 percent since
the end of last year.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on either side
of that rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
