French  consumer spending  rose for
the first time in four months in February, aided by energy
consumption because of a cold snap.  Spending climbed 3 percent from January, when it fell 0.4
percent, national statistics office Insee in Paris said today in
an e-mailed statement. Economists expected an increase of 0.2
percent, according to the median of 20 estimates gathered by
Bloomberg News. From a year earlier, spending rose 0.5 percent.  The boost in spending may add to  Europe ’s second-largest
economy’s recovery after it almost stalled in the fourth
quarter. Confidence among consumers and businesses has started
picking up in recent surveys after plunging in the final months
of last year on concern about Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  While the growth outlook is improving in part with support
from the  European Central Bank , government budget cuts and
rising joblessness will likely weigh on household demand in
months ahead.  “Fairly severe fiscal consolidation will hit households at
a time when unemployment is still rising,” said Joost Beaumont,
an economist at ABN Amro Bank in Amersterdam. “In the months
ahead they may be quite reluctant to spend.”  About two-thirds of the increase in  consumer spending  in
February stemmed from energy consumption, Insee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
