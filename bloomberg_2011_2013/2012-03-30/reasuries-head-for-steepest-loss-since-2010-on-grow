Treasuries fell, posting their
steepest quarterly drop since the last three months of 2010,
while corporate bonds surged as the world’s largest economy
showed signs of improvement.  Thirty-year bond yields rose from a two-week low as
investors sought higher-yielding assets after gains in  consumer
spending  and confidence. U.S. government securities lost 1
percent since Dec. 31 as of yesterday, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. An index of investment-grade and
high-yield corporate bonds returned 3.2 percent, the most since
July to September 2010  “It will be difficult for rates to sell off in a sustained
fashion any time soon unless we get much higher and sustained
growth rates, and by that I mean 3 percent and above,” said
Michael Pond, co-head of interest-rate strategy in New York at
Barclays Plc, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
 Federal Reserve .  Thirty-year bond  yields climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.34 percent at 5:05 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Earlier they fell to
3.25 percent, the lowest level since March 13. They have
increased 44 basis points in 2012, the most since December 2010.
The 3.125 percent securities due in February 2042 tumbled 1
5/32, or $11.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 1/32.  Ten-year note  yields increased five basis points to 2.21
percent. The benchmark  yields  have climbed 33 basis points this
quarter, the most in more than a year. They reached 2.40 percent
on March 20, the highest level since Oct. 28, after touching a
record low 1.67 percent in September. The average over the past
decade is 3.86 percent.  ‘Deck Chairs’  “I’m hearing there’s pretty significant selling out the
curve, selling 30s to buy fives,” said Larry Milstein, managing
director in New York of government and agency debt trading at
R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer for
institutional investors. “This is more short-term play,
rearranging the deck chairs ahead of the weekend and quarter-end
more than anything else.”  Stocks advanced, with the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index
increasing 0.4 percent.  The Fed said today it will buy about $44 billion in longer-
term securities in April and sell about $43 billion in shorter-
term Treasuries. The moves are part of a program to replace $400
billion of shorter-term debt in the bank’s holdings with longer
maturities to hold down borrowing costs. It purchased $2.09
billion of Treasuries today maturing from February 2036 to
August 2041 in its last acquisition in March.  Quantitative Easing  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of debt under two
rounds of quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011 to
support the economy.  Consumer spending in the U.S. rose in February by the most
in seven months, with purchases climbing 0.8 percent, Commerce
Department figures showed today. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey called for a 0.6 percent increase. Incomes
advanced less than projected, sending the saving rate down to
the lowest level in more than two years.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s final index of
consumer sentiment this month rose to 76.2, the highest since
February 2011, from 74.3 in February.  “The U.S. has got some legs, at least for the next couple
of quarters,”  Jim O’Neill , chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television in
 Italy  before the report. “There remain all sorts of issues, but
I think the U.S. is going to continue to positively surprise.”  Real Yield  The increase in Treasury yields this year has brought them
closer to the annual rate of inflation. Ten-year notes have a
so-called real yield of minus 66 basis points, compared with
minus 152 basis points at the end of 2011.  Ten-year yields will increase to 2.54 percent by year-end,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
financial companies, with the most recent projections given the
heaviest weightings.  Philadelphia Fed President  Charles Plosser  said the central
bank may need to raise  interest rates  before late 2014 and
additional stimulus isn’t necessary as the  U.S. economy  shows
signs of strength.  “We should not anticipate additional accommodation,”
Plosser said yesterday in Wilmington,  Delaware . “In the absence
of some shock that derails the recovery, we may well need to
raise rates before the end of 2014.”  The Fed has said economic conditions will probably warrant
keeping its  benchmark rate  at almost zero until at least late
2014. It has held its target for overnight lending between banks
in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  European Crisis  Treasuries rose yesterday as investors sought the safest
assets on speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen again.
 Greece  will probably have to restructure its debt for a second
time,  Moritz Kraemer , head of sovereign ratings at Standard &
Poor’s, said March 28.  European governments capped fresh rescue lending at 500
billion euros ($666 billion), after a Germany-led coalition
opposed a further expansion of the region’s anti-debt-crisis
firewall.  Adding the 300 billion euros already committed to Greece,
Ireland and  Portugal , euro-area finance ministers put the
overall size of the firewall at 800 billion euros. In a
statement, they ruled out using the 240 billion euros left in
the temporary rescue fund to go beyond that.  Europe is counting on the sums pledged so far, plus a 1
trillion-euro cash infusion by the  European Central Bank  into
the financial system, to persuade the rest of the world it’s
doing enough to keep its two-year-old debt crisis at bay.  To contact the reporters on this story:
