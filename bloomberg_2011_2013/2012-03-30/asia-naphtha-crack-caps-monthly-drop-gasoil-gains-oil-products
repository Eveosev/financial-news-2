Asia  refining profits from naphtha
fell for the first month in four. The gasoil and  fuel oil  cracks
rose. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a naphtha cargo and sold
gasoil in Singapore.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
to $118.86 a metric ton at 5:59 p.m. Singapore time from $135.41
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack
spread, a measure of the profit from making the gasoline and
petrochemical feedstock, has narrowed 14 percent this month, the
biggest decline since October.  Shell bought 25,000 tons of open-specification naphtha for
delivery in the second-half of May from Mabanaft GmbH & Co. at
$1,061 a ton, according to a survey of traders who monitored
transactions on the Platts window.  Glencore International Plc, the biggest reported seller of
naphtha this month during trading in  Singapore , sold 25,000 tons
to Noble Energy Inc. at $1,061 a ton. PetroChina Co. bought
50,000 barrels of  92-RON (MOGFC92S)  gasoline from Gracewood International
Ltd. at $134.60 a barrel and bought another 50,000 barrels from
BP Plc at $135 a barrel. Both cargoes were for loading April 14
to 18.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold 150,000 barrels of  gasoil  with 0.5 percent
sulfur for loading April 14 to April 18 to Hin Leong Trading Pte
at a discount of 20 cents a barrel to benchmark prices for the
grade, according to the Bloomberg survey.  JP Morgan Ventures, a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co., sold
150,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur for loading
April 18 to April 22 to Trafigura Beheer BV at a discount of 10

barrels of gasoil with 10 parts-per-million of sulfur to BP Plc
at a premium of $3 a barrel to prices of gasoil with 0.5 percent
sulfur.  Gasoil traded at a premium of $15.50 a barrel to Dubai
crude, down 53 cents from yesterday, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack spread  widened 3.3 percent
this week and has gained 2.2 percent this month.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose to 25 cents today. The
 regrade  was at 20 cents a week earlier, indicating it is more
profitable to make  aviation fuel  relative to diesel.  Fuel Oil  Koch Industries Inc. sold 25,000 tons of 380-centistoke
fuel oil for loading April 14 to April 18 to BP at a premium of
$2 a ton to average prices next month, the Bloomberg survey of
traders showed.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai fell to $6.67 a barrel from
$5.70 yesterday, data from PVM showed. The  discount  has narrowed
4.5 percent this week and 8 percent in March, signaling reduced
losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180)  fuel oil to  380-centistoke (N6SHS380) 
grade, or the  viscosity spread , dropped 50 cents to $11.50 a
ton, PVM data showed.  Refinery News  Reliance Industries Ltd. plans to shut a diesel
hydrotreater at the older of its two plants for maintenance this
month, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The
unit at the 660,000 barrel-a-day Jamnagar site in  India ’s
Gujarat state will be shut until mid-April. The company may also
close a crude-distillation unit and a vacuum-gasoil hydrotreater
at the same refinery later.  Tenders  Qatar International Petroleum Marketing Co., known as
Tasweeq, offered to sell 20,000 to 25,000 tons of gasoil for
delivery in April to  Egypt , according to a notice sent to
potential buyers.  Total SA and China International United Petroleum &
Chemical Co., or Unipec, bought a total of 70,000 tons of
naphtha from Oil & Natural Gas Corp., said two traders. Unipec

about $43.50 more than Middle East prices for another cargo
loading later in the month.  LG Chem Ltd. bought 50,000 to 70,000 tons of naphtha for
