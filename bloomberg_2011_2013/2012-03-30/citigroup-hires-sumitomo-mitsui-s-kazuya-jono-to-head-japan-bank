Citigroup Inc. (C)  hired Kazuya Jono, a
former executive at  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , to
head its banking operations in Japan, according to an internal
memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  Citibank Japan Ltd. ’s board this afternoon approved his
appointment as chief executive officer, succeeding Peter Eliot,
who will become president of the Japanese holding company,
according to the document. Mika Nemoto, a Tokyo-based
spokeswoman at Citigroup, confirmed the contents of the memo.  “Citi management and I consider Japan to be a
strategically important market,” Citibank N.A. Chief Executive
Officer Eugene McQuade, who is in  Tokyo  today, said in the memo.  Citigroup is seeking to bolster the Japanese unit’s local
governance and management after the Financial Services Agency
punished the New York-based lender for at least the third time
in seven years in December following regulatory breaches.  Jono, 57, will join Citibank on June 1. He has 35 years of
experience in the Japanese banking industry, and held positions
in corporate banking, retail banking and risk management at
 Sumitomo Mitsui .  Citigroup had been seeking a Japanese national to run the
local banking unit to ensure the person is familiar with the
nation’s rules and retail market, two people familiar with the
matter said in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
