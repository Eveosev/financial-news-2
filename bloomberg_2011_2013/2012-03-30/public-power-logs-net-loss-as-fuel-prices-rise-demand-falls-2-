Public Power Corp SA (PPC) ,  Greece ’s
biggest electricity company, posted a loss in 2011 because of
increased fuel prices, lower demand and higher taxes at two
units.  PPC had a net loss of 148.9 million euros ($199 million) in
2011 from a year earlier profit of 557.9 million euros, said the
company in a filing today to the Greek bourse. Sales fell 5.1
percent to 5.5 billion euros.  Expenses for fuel, natural gas and energy purchases rose by
more than 31 percent, or 553.2 million euros. Total electricity
sales, including exports, fell 4.4 percent with the
corresponding revenue declining 6.8 percent. Demand from Greek
retail customers dropped 4.7 percent and revenue from the sector
fell 7 percent, the company said.  “2011 has been an exceptionally challenging year as the
 Greek economy  is going through the greatest recession of the
last decades,” Arthouros Zervos,  Public Power ’s chairman and
chief executive said in the statement.  “In 2012, we expect that the increase in tariffs and
further payroll savings as well as all other initiatives for
expense rationalization will have a positive impact on the
financial results,” Zervos said.  Payroll costs fell more than 11 percent, or by 161 million
euros, as the number of permanent employees declined in 2011 by
1,024 to 20,821. Electricity production from cheaper hydro
generation dropped 20 percent amid lower rainfall.  The company said it will pay no dividend on 2011 earnings.
Shares in the company fell 2.1 percent to 3.35 euros at the
close of trade in  Athens  today. The stock has fallen 11.8
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
