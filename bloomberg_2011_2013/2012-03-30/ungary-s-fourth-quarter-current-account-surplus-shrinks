 Hungary’s fourth-quarter current-
account surplus shrank from the previous three months to the
smallest since the last quarter of 2009.  The current-account showed a surplus of 149 million euros
($199 million), compared with a revised 439 million euros in the
previous three months and a revised 226 million euros a year
earlier, the  Magyar Nemzeti Bank  said today. The seasonally
adjusted current-account surplus was 306 million euros, the
central bank said.  Hungary’s current-account balance has been improving as the
economy recovers from a  contraction  of 6.7 percent in 2009, its
worst in 18 years, which sapped consumer demand and reduced
industrial output. The government expects a surplus of more than
2 percent of gross domestic product in 2012, Economy Minister
 Gyorgy Matolcsy  said on Sept. 30.  The surplus was 1.4 billion euros in 2011, compared with
1.2 billion euros a year earlier, according to preliminary data.
Hungary’s net external financing capacity, or the combined
surplus of the current and capital accounts, was an adjusted 3.8
percent of GDP in the fourth quarter.  The country had a surplus of 1.5 billion euros in the trade
of goods and services, down from 1.8 billion euros in the
previous quarter while the surplus on services declined to 689
million euros from 989 million euros. The drop in services
income was largely the result of a seasonal decline in tourism,
Zsuzsa Fekete, head of balance of payments statistics at the
bank told reporters.  Current transfers from the EU had a surplus of 417 million
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
