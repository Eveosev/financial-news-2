Telkom South Africa Ltd. (TKG)  plunged to
the lowest in more than eight years after saying earnings
excluding one-time items probably fell at least 25 percent for
the year through March.  Shares in the Pretoria-based Telkom dropped 1.4 percent to
24 rand, the lowest since October 2003, at the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg.  Africaâ€™s largest fixed-line phone company said earnings
excluding one-time items will be at least 25 percent lower than
the prior year as it spent about 739 million ($96.4 million)
firing workers and recorded a 1.5 billion rand loss on the sale
and impairment of two businesses in the year.  Basic earnings per share from continuing operations will be
at least 90 percent lower than the restated 4.85 rand per share
last year, said Telkom.  The company, majority-owned by the South African
government, will lose about 650 million rand on the sale of
Nigerian unit Multi-Links Telecommunications Ltd., it said on
Sept. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
