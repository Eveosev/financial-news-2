Coach Kim Mulkey, who is taking
undefeated Baylor University into the Final Four of the national
women’s basketball championship in two days, has been diagnosed
with Bell’s palsy, the school said.  Bell’s palsy is a form of facial paralysis caused by a
nerve dysfunction that results in the inability to control
muscles. The condition usually has a rapid onset, often
occurring overnight.  “I noticed while we were in  Des Moines  last week that my
tongue felt strange,” Mulkey said yesterday in a statement.
“Yesterday I noticed when I smiled, only the left side of my
mouth was working. Also, my right eye was drooping and I
couldn’t hear properly out of my right ear.”  Mulkey said she missed practice two days ago and went to
the doctor after consulting with the team’s trainer, Alex Olson.  “Coach Mulkey is being treated with an anti-viral
medication along with oral steroids to reduce the inflammation
of the facial nerve,” Olson said.  The Lady Bears are two wins from their second national
championship under Mulkey and the NCAA’s first 40-win season.
Baylor meets Stanford on April 1 in Denver, while  Connecticut 
and Notre Dame play in the second National Collegiate Athletic
Association national semifinal contest.  The championship game is April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
