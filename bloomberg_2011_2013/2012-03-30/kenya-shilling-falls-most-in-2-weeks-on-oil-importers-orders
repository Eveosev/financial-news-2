Kenya’s shilling weakened the most
in two weeks on increased dollar demand by oil importers seeking
to place orders for the new month.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy retreated to
close the day 0.6 percent down at 82.95 per dollar, the biggest
slump since March 16.  “The shilling is under pressure as buyers from the energy
sector continue to accumulate dollars ahead of the new month for
placement of their orders,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at
Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of  Africa  Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC)  won a tender to supply Kenya Petroleum
Refineries Ltd. with a single cargo of 610,000 barrels of Murban
crude oil in May, it said in an e-mailed statement on March 22.  The  inflation rate  declined for a fourth month to 15.61
percent in March from 16.69 percent in the previous month, the
Nairobi-based  Kenya  National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-
mailed statement today. On a monthly basis, prices rose 1.3
percent after falling 0.04 percent in February, it said.  The increase in the monthly rate is likely to see the
central bank maintain the key benchmark rate when it meets on
April 4, according to a note by Standard chartered Bank Plc.  The central bank left its key lending rate at a record high
of 18 percent for a third month after increasing it six times
last year to keep the inflation rate under check and support the
shilling. The Kenyan currency has gained 28 percent since
reaching a record low in October, the best performer among more
than 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “We are unlikely to see any policy rate easing in Kenya
until the early June MPC meeting at the earliest,”  Razia Khan 
regional head of research for Africa at  Standard Chartered ,
wrote in the note.  Tanzania’s shilling closed 0.4 percent weaker, the most
since Feb. 17, at 1,591 to the dollar. The Ugandan shilling
appreciated 0.3 percent to close at 2,506.88 per dollar after
gaining as much as 0.5 percent to 2,502.5 during the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
