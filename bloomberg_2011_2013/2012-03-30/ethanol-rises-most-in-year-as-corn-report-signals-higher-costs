Ethanol rose the most in a year in
 Chicago  after a government report on corn inventories signaled
higher production costs.  Futures surged after the Agriculture Department said corn
stockpiles on March 1 declined to the lowest level for this time
of year since 2004. U.S. distillers typically use the grain to
make ethanol.  “That stocks report was bullish, friendly towards corn,”
said John Janney, a vice president at Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery soared 11.5 cents, or
5.4 percent, to $2.265 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest one-day gain since March 31, 2011. Futures have
risen 2.8 percent this year in the first quarterly gain since
March 2011.  Corn for May delivery rose the exchange-limit 40 cents, or
6.6 percent, to $6.44 a bushel in Chicago.  Distillers are losing 6 cents per gallon of ethanol based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel, assuming a bushel of
corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
