 Stress tests conducted on  Mexico ’s
banking system suggest it is able to withstand “severe” shocks,
the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Mexican authorities will need to remain vigilant as risks
of spillover from global crises remain, the IMF said in a report
published on its website.  High concentration in Mexico’s financial system and foreign
ownership of major banks pose “important” challenges, according
to a summary of the IMF’s study of Mexico’s financial sector.
The seven largest financial companies managed about three
quarters of total financial assets in June 2011, the report
said.  Latin America’s second-largest economy should establish a
fixed term for the president of its banking commission and
adjust the composition of its board, the IMF said.  Mexico’s economy will grow 3.5 percent this year, according
to the  Finance Ministry . Central bank Governor Agustin Carstens
said in a March 23 interview that gross domestic product will
likely expand at the top end of the bank’s 3 percent to 4
percent target range after data in the first few months of the
year were better-than-forecast.
