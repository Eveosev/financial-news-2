European Union regulators extended
until Sept. 6 their review of  Universal Music Group ’s bid for
the recorded-music business of EMI Group.  The companies requested the extension, according to a
filing on the European Commission’s website today. The EU
antitrust agency last week opened an in-depth probe into the
deal to examine competition concerns over sales of physical and
digital recorded music.  “This is a standard procedural option” which gives the EU
more time to consider companies’ arguments “with a view to
disposing of the case as early as possible,” said Adam White, a
spokesman for  Vivendi SA’s (VIV)  Universal in  London .  Universal would be “almost twice the size of the next
largest player” in  Europe , the EU said last week when it
announced its investigation, and may not be “sufficiently
constrained” by smaller rivals, customers’ buying power or
illegal music downloads. The probe will confirm or rule out
those concerns.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  agreed in November to sell EMI Group’s
recorded-music and publishing businesses in separate
transactions for a combined $4.1 billion. Universal will buy
EMI’s record labels, home to Katy Perry and Coldplay, for
1.2 billion pounds ($1.9 billion). A Sony Corp.-led group that
includes billionaire  David Geffen  will pay $2.2 billion for the
publishing unit, according to statements in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
