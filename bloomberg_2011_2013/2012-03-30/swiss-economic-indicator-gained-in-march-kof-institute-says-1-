Switzerland ’s KOF economic
indicator increased in March, adding to signs the economy is
regaining some strength.  The monthly gauge, which aims to predict the economy’s
direction about six months ahead, rose to 0.08 from a revised
minus 0.11 in February, the KOF Swiss Economic Institute in
Zurich said in an e-mailed  statement  today. Economists forecast
a gain to 0.07, the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  “We might see further gains in the indicator in coming
months,” said Martin Gueth, an economist at Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart,  Germany . “However, there won’t be a
surge as the Swiss economy is merely stabilizing.”  Switzerland’s economy is showing signs of improvement as
exports are resisting flagging global demand and as private
spending is holding up. Foreign sales gained more than expected
in February and the Swiss central bank this month said “there
are growing indications” that the economy “is stabilizing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
