England  fast bowler  Stuart Broad 
will miss the final Test with  Sri Lanka  with a right calf
strain, the England and Wales Cricket Board said.  The 25-year-old will fly home for treatment, and will not
be replaced in the squad, the board said today in an e-mailed
statement. The final Test starts April 3 in  Colombo .  Sri Lanka beat top-ranked England by 75 runs in their
series-opening cricket Test yesterday as Rangana Herath took 12
wickets.  The victory puts Sri Lanka 1-0 up in the best-of-two
contest as the home team seeks a first elite series win since
beating  New Zealand  in August 2009.  It was the host’s first
home Test victory since the 2010 retirement of  Muttiah
Muralitharan , the sport’s record wicket taker.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
