Merko Ehitus AS (MRK1T)  and three of its
subsidiaries were ordered to pay fines totaling 800,000 euros
($1.1 million) by an Estonian court for offering bribes to an
official of the Tallinn City government.  Harju County Court fined Merko Ehitus, the biggest listed
Baltic builder, 300,000 euros; the companyâ€™s OU Constancia and
OU Woody subsidiaries were fined 200,000 euros each and its OU
Metsailu unit 100,000 euros, the court said in an e-mailed
statement today. Merko, in a regulatory statement, denied paying
bribes and said it plans to appeal the verdict.  The stock was down 1.5 percent, at 6.05 euros, at 12:54
p.m. in Tallinn, the lowest level in two weeks. Merko has gained
11 percent this year, compared with an average 15 percent gain
by its Eastern European Industrials peers, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The court found Ivo Parbus, a former adviser to Tallinn
municipality, guilty of soliciting and accepting large bribes on
multiple accounts. He was sentenced to two and a half years in
prison. Tonu Korts, a former management board member of Merko
Ehitus, was sentenced to two years and three months in prison,
of which 22 months are conditional, for giving multiple bribes.
Five other individuals also received jail sentences.  Parbus had taken a total of more than 980,000 krooni
($83,500) in money and gift vouchers to arrange detailed plans
and speed up the issuance of construction permits between May
and December of 2008, according to the indictment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
