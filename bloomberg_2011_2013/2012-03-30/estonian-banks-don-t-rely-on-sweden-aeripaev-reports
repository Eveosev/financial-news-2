Estonia’s biggest lenders aren’t
dependent on financing from their Swedish parent companies after
an increase in deposits and contraction in borrowing,  Aeripaeev 
cited Priit Perens, the head of the local unit of  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) ,
as saying in an interview.  The loan-to-deposit ratio of Estonian banks, which also
include the subsidiaries of SEB AB and  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) , has
declined to 123 percent from about 190 percent in 2007, the
Tallinn-based newspaper cited Perens as saying. Estonian banks
are financing their lending operations independently, when
factoring in their equity capital, it said.  Most of Estonian banks have abandoned collateral-based
financing, meaning clients are mainly assessed based on their
potential cashflow or income, instead of the value of their
collateral, Aeripaeev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
