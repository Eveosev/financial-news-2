Orascom Development Holding AG (ODHN) , the
hotel and construction company, will get a direct loan of 75
million Swiss francs ($83 million) from company chairman and
majority owner Samih Sawiris to help fund construction projects
this year.  Sawiris will additionally guarantee as much as 50 million
francs of bank loans, Orascom Development Chief Financial
Officer Mahmoud Zuaiter said in an interview at the company’s
2011 results conference in Zurich.  Orascom needs the funding to complete unfinished hotel
projects in Oman and  Switzerland . The company lost 69.7 million
francs in 2011 as it battled low sales in  Egypt  because of
political unrest. Egypt contributed 70 percent to Orascom
Development’s 2010 sales.  Zuaiter says the two-year line of credit is priced at
“Swiss market rates,” which he says are 3 percent to 4 percent
today. Orascom has withdrawn 25 million francs of the  credit
line  to date, he says.  The company announced in January that it had finalized up
to 125 million francs of financing as a result of the
commitments of the chairman, without giving further details.  Orascom Development’s management is working out how much
financing will be needed for new projects in 2013, and is
negotiating financing for capital expenditure with banks.
Zuaiter says he will have a clearer idea of its needs when the
company reports first-half results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
