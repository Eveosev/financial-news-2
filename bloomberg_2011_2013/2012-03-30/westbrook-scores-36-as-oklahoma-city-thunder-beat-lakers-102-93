The  Oklahoma City  Thunder opened
the second half with 11 straight points and went on to defeat
the Los Angeles Lakers 102-93 in a National Basketball
Association game.  Russell Westbrook scored 36 points for the Thunder, who at
39-12 have the best record in the NBA’s Western Conference.
 Kevin Durant  added 21 points and 11 rebounds for Oklahoma City.  Derek Fisher, who won five NBA titles with the Lakers, had
seven points for Oklahoma City in his first game back in Los
Angeles since getting traded away by the Lakers earlier this
month and then signing with the Thunder as a free agent.  Andrew Bynum had 25 points and Kobe Bryant added 23 for  Los
Angeles  (31-20), which is in third place in the Western
Conference. Last night’s game was played at the Staples Center
in Los Angeles, where the Lakers had lost only four of their
previous 24 games this season.  Earlier yesterday, the Miami Heat broke a two-game losing
streak with a 106-85 victory against the Dallas Mavericks in a
rematch of last season’s NBA Finals. LeBron James and Chris Bosh
each had 19 points and nine rebounds for the Heat (36-13), who
improved to 21-2 this season at AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
