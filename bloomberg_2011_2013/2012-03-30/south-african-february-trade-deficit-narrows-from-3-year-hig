South Africa ’s trade deficit
narrowed in February from a three-year high in the previous
month as vehicle and machinery exports climbed.  The  shortfall  eased to 7.5 billion rand ($976 million) from
13.5 billion rand in January, the Pretoria-based South African
Revenue Service said in an e-mailed statement today. The  median
estimate  of 11 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a
deficit of 5 billion rand.  An improvement in exports last month may help to narrow the
current account deficit, the broadest measure of trade of goods
and services, and underpin the rand’s gains. The  current account
gap  eased to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in the fourth
quarter from 4.1 percent in the previous three months, the
central bank said on March 19.  Exports rose 4.2 percent to 56.3 billion rand in February
from the previous month, led by a 73 percent surge in vehicles
and aircrafts and a 34 percent increase in machinery and
electrical appliances. Imports fell 5.6 percent to 63.7 billion
rand, as machinery shipments plunged 22 percent.  The current account deficit will probably widen to 4.3
percent this year as consumer demand for imports surges,
according to the government. Credit growth accelerated 7.9
percent in February, the fastest pace since 2009, the central
bank said today.  The monthly trade figures are often volatile, reflecting
the timing of shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
