Turkish  bond yields  dropped after
the central bank offered funding to banks at its lowest rate for
the first time in seven working days. The drop extended the
biggest decline in bond yields in emerging markets this year.  Yields (BENCH)  on benchmark two-year bonds fell 19 basis points, or
0.19 percentage point, to 9.31 percent at the close in Istanbul,
their biggest drop since March 8. The lira gained 0.1 percent to
1.7829 per dollar.  The central bank today extended 6 billion liras ($3.4
billion) of funding to banks at its benchmark one-week repo rate
of 5.75 percent, the first time it did so since March 22, when
it began forcing banks to borrow at one-month repo rates of 11.5
percent.  “We’ve returned to a ‘normal day’ in monetary policy,”
Gizem Oztok Altinsac, an economist at Garanti Securities, said
in e-mailed comments. “The loosening in rates is occurring for
this reason and may continue.”  The central bank in Ankara stopped lending at the benchmark
rate on March 22, squeezing lira liquidity to support the lira
and stem inflation, which was 10.4 percent in February.  Turkish bond yields have declined 169 basis points this
year, the biggest drop among major  emerging markets  worldwide.
The lira has appreciated 6 percent against the dollar on the
year, after declining 18 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
