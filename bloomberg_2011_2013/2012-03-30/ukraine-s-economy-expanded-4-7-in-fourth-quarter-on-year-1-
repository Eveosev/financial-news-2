Ukraine’s  economy  grew 4.7 percent
in the final quarter of 2011 from the same period a year
earlier, the statistics office said.  Gross domestic product expanded 5.2 percent for all of last
year, the office said in a statement on its  website . The office
revised first-quarter GDP growth to 5.4 percent from 5.3
percent, according to the release. The second-quarter expansion
was revised to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent and the third-
quarter was amended to 6.5 percent from 6.6 percent.  Seasonally adjusted growth in the fourth quarter was 1
percent, according to the release.  Ukraine’s government led by Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov 
expects growth of 3.9 percent this year as demand for Ukraine’s
primary export, steel, may fall because of  Europe ’s debt crisis.
Ukraine’s economy expanded an annual 2 percent in February, the
central bank said this week.  The central bank cut its main  interest rate  in March for
the first time since 2010 to help economic growth. The key
discount rate was reduced a quarter of a percentage point by the
 Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  to 7.5 percent from March 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
