The ruble appreciated against the
dollar, snapping three days of declines, as economic sanctions
against  Iran  spurred prices for oil,  Russia ’s main export.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 29.30 per
dollar as of 10:17 a.m. in Moscow. The country’s $3.5 billion of
Eurobonds due 2020 rose, pushing the yield down four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.12 percent.  Brent crude futures gained 0.3 percent to $122.76 per
barrel after U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill seeking to expand
sanctions on Iran, the second-biggest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Oil and gas
together contribute about 17 percent of Russia’s gross domestic
product and 50 percent of state revenue, according to government
estimates.  The ruble lost 0.2 percent to 39.1947 per euro and was
little changed at 33.7732 against the central bank’s target
 dollar-euro basket . Investors pared bets on the currency
weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
29.6986 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 29.8803 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
