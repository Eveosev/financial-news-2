Taiwan ’s dollar had its first
weekly gain in a month on speculation the central bank will
allow appreciation to temper inflation.  Government bonds  were
little changed.  The central bank held the  benchmark   interest rate  at 1.875
percent on March 22, and said consumer prices will be a bigger
issue than maintaining economic growth this year. Industrial
production rebounded 8.4 percent last month from a year earlier,
after a 16.8 percent slump in January, official data show.  “It’s possible the central bank may let the currency rise
more to ease imported inflation later this year,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at Union Bank of Taiwan in Taipei.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent today and this
week to NT$29.53 against its U.S. counterpart, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. The currency has appreciated 2.6 percent this
quarter, the most in a year. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings that traders use to price
options, was steady at 4 percent today and is down from 6.3
percent at the end of 2011.  A government report on April 5 may show the  consumer-price
index  rose 1.2 percent in March from a year earlier, after a
0.25 percent increase the previous month, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 was steady at 0.996 percent today, compared with benchmark
five-year yields of 0.987 percent on Dec. 30, according to
Gretai Securities Market.  The overnight  money-market  rate was little changed at 0.414
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center. It was 0.405 percent at the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
