UT Bank Ltd. (UTB) , a lender in the West
African nation, rose the most in two weeks as a $15 million
equity injection by the International Finance Corp. was enough
to meet a minimum capitalization requirement of the central
bank.  The stock rose 1 pesewa, or 3.3 percent, to 31 pesewas as
of the close in Accra, the capital, the biggest gain since March
16.  The Bank of Ghana’s policy requires lenders to increase
stated capital to a minimum of 60 million cedis ($33.8 million)
by the end of the year.  UT Bank’s now stands “slightly above 60 million cedis
after it received the money from IFC yesterday,” Randy Mensah,
a stock trader at Databank Financial Services Ltd. in Accra,
said by phone today. “That was boosting some confidence in the
shares on the market.”  The deal will enable the Accra-based bank to boost loans to
small-and medium-sized businesses, according to a statement from
the bank yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
