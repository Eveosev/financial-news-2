Jim Yong Kim, the U.S. nominee to
head the  World Bank , added two stops to his global tour to drum
up support for his candidacy among the bank’s shareholders.  Kim, nominated March 23 by President Barack Obama to
succeed Robert Zoellick, will visit Shaoxing,  China , and
Brussels. He is due to arrive in Shaoxing tomorrow and meet with
Chinese Vice Premier  Wang Qishan , the U.S. Treasury Department
said in a statement in Washington today.  Other stops on his trip from March 27 to April 9 include
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul, New Delhi,
Brasilia and Mexico City. The trip is part of his “listening
tour” to solicit ideas for the poverty-fighting lender from
heads of state, finance ministers and others, the Treasury said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
