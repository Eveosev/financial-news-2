Serbia ’s central bank sold euros
for a fourth consecutive day today, lifting the dinar 0.3
percent after it fell to as low as 111.7900 to the euro.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 60 million
euros ($79.91 million), its second-biggest daily intervention
this year, to “enable the smooth functioning of the foreign-
exchange market,” it said in a statement posted on its website.
The bank has sold 498.5 million euros since the start of 2012 to
prop up the dinar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
