Former CBS Sports analyst Billy Packer said in an interview on “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend on Bloomberg Television, that the
 University of Kentucky  is the “prohibitive favorite” to win
this year’s  National Collegiate Athletic Association  basketball
championship, while the college game is being hurt by players
who leave for the pros after one year.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Welcome back. For decades, his voice was the one
heard across the country during March Madness. Former CBS Sports
analyst Billy Packer, the best at what he did, and a fellow
Demon Deacon, joins us now from  Charlotte , North Carolina.  Billy, great to have you on. Let me start off. You’re a
keen observer, even though you’re not doing the games on CBS.
The caliber of teams this year and players, better than average,
below average, what?  BILLY PACKER: Well, I would say, in regard to a historical
perspective, the game is not what it used to be because of so
many kids leaving early, so that the talent level of teams that
play in intercollegiate basketball now is way off of what it
used to be.  But from a standpoint of the historical perspective
of who are these teams and who are the guys coaching them, it’s
about as good a Final Four as you could possibly put together.  HUNT: Oh, boy, it sure is. Let’s talk about that one-and-
out.   John Calipari  has mastered it at  Kentucky , works for him,
may even work for some of the players who make it big in the
pros, but it wouldn’t seem to work for the concept of a student
athlete or the value of an academic environment.  PACKER: Well, one of the things that I felt -- and it was a
huge article this morning in  USA Today  by Mark Emmert, who’s the
president of the NCAA, he’s kind of like your Washington people.
He either knows and is trying to put a positive spin on
something, or he doesn’t know, but in either case, the final
conclusion that he makes that guys leaving one and done is an
overhyped issue.  It’s not at all.  It’s changed the entire historic
perspective of the intercollegiate game, and it’s affected the
NBA, as well, and a negative impact in most cases.  And if  Mark Emmert  doesn’t understand what it does to
intercollegiate basketball, not the kids that go and they’re
successful, but the kids that think they’re going to go or kids
that are told that they’re going to be great at age 16, and
that’s their only perspective, only to fall short, but in many
cases when it’s too late.  So it’s not the kids that go and that are successful. It’s
how it undermines the game.  HUNT: It’s bad for the game and bad for -- and bad for
college.  PACKER: Oh, I don’t think there’s any doubt about it. The
reason that the college game gained great success was because it
built history with inside teams. I mean, you and I are graduates
of Wake Forest.  Tim Duncan  will forever be part of their
history.  Tim Duncan was a four-year player. You watched Tim
progress not only as an individual, but also as a basketball
player. And by the time he got to be a senior and went into the
NBA, he was ready to impact immediately and had a lot of
notoriety, which could be implemented by the NBA.  That no longer is the case. And therefore, I think it not
only hurts the intercollegiate game -- can you imagine, there
are probably right now -- he talks about 40 kids left after
their freshmen year since it was implicated in ‘06. Those 40
guys would be on probably 20 teams.  Those are 20 teams that
would be improved by players of NBA caliber.  And in addition to that, underclassmen, sophomore and
juniors, that would still be playing are over 100 kids that
would be playing college basketball, completely changing the
landscape of the quality of the upper echelon teams and also
their ability to play and eventually be marketed well by the
NBA, having shown what they can really do.  HUNT: Billy, I understand why some kids leave, because they
don’t have any money, they need to make money, et cetera, but
why does a guy like Austin Rivers, the son of a multimillionaire
Boston Celtics coach, Doc Rivers, a great university, Duke, a
freshman, why does he go NBA?  PACKER: Well, I think that you can separate the need from
those that have no need in this respect. Austin Rivers would be
simply an example of what the modern kid -- he’s recognized when
he’s about 15, maybe even younger than that, 14 years of age.
He’s groomed in AAU summer leagues. His entire focus is on being
told that he’s going to be a superstar in the NBA.  So the mindset of these kids is that college is a pass-
through. And in many cases, it’s very difficult, even for a
coach like  Mike Krzyzewski , who without question is an
incredible coach, able to get that mindset to say, you know,
son, you are a good player, you can become a great player.
You’re not that yet.  There’s a lot of things you have to learn
how to do.  I never did see him, by the way, ever stop anybody one on
one defensively on the perimeter. So is he ready to be an NBA
player that can help a team to the playoffs by next year? The
answer to that is no. But it’s so engrained in his mind, even
though -- and I know Doc Rivers extremely well -- even though
his father would be able to give him all kinds of examples,
that’s what he wants to do.  So, therefore, that is his only goal in mind, and a goal
that I think is really kind of foolish, because in my mind, he
had to prove -- and still has to prove - that he can take a
team, put them on his back, and throughout the course of a
season, lead them to an ACC Championship, much less an NCAA
Championship, to be a productive NBA player of impact.  HUNT: OK. Last year on this program, you strongly suggested
the UConn Huskies would win it all, and they did. Now, everybody
this side of  Barack Obama  says Kentucky is a cinch in  New
Orleans  this weekend.  PACKER: Well, let me interrupt you on that. Why did he pick
 North Carolina ?  HUNT: I don’t know.  Because -  PACKER: Sure you -- sure you do. It’s a swing state, and
it’s where -- that’s where the -- the Democratic convention is
going to be held.  PACKER: So I’ll leave it at that.  HUNT: This year is Kentucky, a lead pipe cinch, or can
somebody beat them? And who’s the most likely to beat them?  PACKER: Well, I think that this year any one of the teams
are capable of beating any one of the other teams in a one-and-
done situation, and that’s what makes the tournament so great. I
would say this year that Kentucky is a prohibitive favorite
because of the way they play, and there are so many different
things that they can do on the court, both offensively and
defensively, that gives them an excellent chance to win this.
And I think they are the prohibitive favorites.  HUNT: OK. Billy Packer, as always, it’s great to see you.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
