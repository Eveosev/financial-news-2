French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  indicated that euro-area governments won’t decide today
who to nominate to the  European Central Bank ’s executive board.  Governments are also considering nominations for the heads
of the euro group of finance ministers, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the European Stability
Mechanism.  “There’s a bit of a merry-go-round,” Baroin told
reporters today before a meeting of the 17 euro-region finance
ministers in Copenhagen. “We need time. We need a global accord
to have an agreement on the euro group, and as this decision
will only be made in June, there’ll be no decision on this
question before the French presidential election. We need a
global accord.”  French voters go to the polls in two rounds on April 22 and
May 6 to choose a president for the next five years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
