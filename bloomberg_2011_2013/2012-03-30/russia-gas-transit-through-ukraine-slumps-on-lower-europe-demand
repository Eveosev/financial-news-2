Ukraine’s transit of Russian
natural-gas has fallen by about 50 percent “these days” after
 Europe ’s demand for the fuel shrank, said Vadym Chuprun, deputy
chief executive officer of NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy.  The daily flows fell by about 180 million cubic meters the
day before yesterday and as much 200 million cubic meters by
last night, Chuprun told reporters today in Kiev. Ukraine’s
state energy company had planned to ship 400 million cubic
meters of Russian gas, he said.  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , the Russian gas-export monopoly that supplies
a quarter of Europe’s gas, ships as much as 80 percent of the
fuel to the continent via Ukraine’s pipelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
