Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s implied valued rose
8.9 percent to $102.8 billion yesterday in what was expected to
be the last auction of its stock on SharesPost Inc.’s exchange
before the social-networking company’s initial public offering.  SharesPost  completed the auction at a price of $44.10 for
150,000 units, the firm said in an e-mailed statement. That’s up
from an auction earlier this month with a price of $40.50 a
share, valuing the company at $94.4 billion, based on a share
count of 2.33 billion.  Facebook (FB) , the world’s most popular social-networking
service, filed for an IPO last month that could value the
business at between $75 billion and $100 billion, people
familiar with the matter have said. The Menlo Park, California-
based company, which has more than 845 million users, is seeking
$5 billion in what would be the largest Internet IPO on record.  The company decided to halt the trading of its shares on
secondary markets at the end of this week as it prepares for the
IPO, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Facebook aims
to hold the offering in early May, one person said. SharesPost
moved up the date of the Facebook auction to yesterday from
April 2 to meet the deadline.  Earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission settled with SharesPost to resolve claims that the
online marketplace acted as an unregistered broker of shares. It
was the first action in a broad probe of trades involving
nonpublic startups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
