CIM Group  and developer  Harry Macklowe  are planning to build a Manhattan residential tower
that would be the tallest in  New York City .  Macklowe and Los Angeles-based CIM intend to build an 82-
story, 1,397-foot (436-meter) building at the site of the former
Drake Hotel on Park Avenue. The plan was included in permit
applications for a sprinkler system and fire alarm  filed  this
week with the New York City Department of Buildings.  The developers previously filed plans to build a  six-story ,
88-foot building on the site, according to city records. Those
papers haven’t been updated to reflect the new size of the
tower, according to Ryan FitzGibbon, a department spokeswoman.  “They’ve indicated on subsequent applications that the
height of the new building will now be 82 stories,” FitzGibbon
said in a telephone interview. “However, they have not yet
amended the new building plans nor have these subsequent filings
been approved.”  Steve Solomon, a spokesman for Macklowe, referred questions
about the building to CIM. Bill Mendel, a spokesman for CIM,
declined to comment.  At 1,397 feet, the tower would surpass a residential
property Extell Development Co. is building on West 57th Street.
That one is planned to reach 953 feet, FitzGibbon said. The
Extell site is slated to be  New York ’s tallest residential
building when it’s completed next year.  The Empire State Building, a commercial property, stands at
1,250 feet, according to FitzGibbon.  The plans were reported yesterday by the Real Deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
