Essex County Cricket Club submitted
a bid with the University of East  London  to use the 2012 Olympic
Stadium after the Games end later this year, the club said in a
statement.  “We can confirm that the University of East London and
Essex Country Cricket Club have put in a joint bid to the
Olympic Park Legacy Company to utilize space in the Olympic
stadium,” the university said today in an e-mailed statement.  London organizers in February 2011 recommended a bid from
the east London-based soccer club West Ham and the borough of
Newham over a joint attempt by Premier League team Tottenham
Hotspur and AEG, a U.S.-based entertainment facility operator.
In October, the agreement with West Ham collapsed after a series
of legal challenges from Tottenham and east London soccer club
Leyton Orient.  The Olympic Park Legacy Company, which is selling and
leasing facilities built for the Games, received four bids for
the 80,000 capacity Olympic Stadium last week. West Ham said on
March 23 that it had submitted a renewed bid, which is supported
by U.K. Athletics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
