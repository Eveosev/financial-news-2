France â€™s highest administrative
court has been advised by an independent magistrate to cancel
preferential tariffs for wind-generated electricity,  Les Echos 
reported, citing industry officials.  The newspaper quoted Nicolas Wolff, director general of
wind turbine maker Vestas France SAS, as saying that one-third
of wind-power operators in France could go out of business if
the recommendation is accepted by the court, or State Council.  The magistrate said France had failed to notify the
European Commission when it set a guaranteed tariff of 82 euros
($111) per megawatt hour for wind power in 2008,  Les Echos  said.
A group opposing wind-turbine construction has challenged the
tariff on grounds that it is a form of state aid and therefore
subject to EC review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
