Votorantim Participacoes SA doesn’t
plan to top a $3.31 billion offer for  Cimpor Cimentos de
Portugal SGPS SA  while it may weigh buying a stake in the cement
maker and teaming up with Camargo Correa SA to take control, two
people familiar with the matter said.  Votorantim said today it will analyze Camargo’s offer for
Cimpor and evaluate all alternatives, according to an e-mailed
statement. The Sao Paulo-based company may decide to sell its
existing Cimpor stake, said the two people, who declined to be
identified because the negotiations are private. An official
with Votorantim declined to comment.  Camargo, through its Intercement Austria subsidiary, bid
5.50 euros ($7.34) a share for Lisbon-based Cimpor,  Portugal ’s
largest cement producer, Intercement said today in a filing to
the Portuguese securities regulator. Camargo has a 32.9 percent
stake in Cimpor, while Votorantim holds 21.2 percent.  Votorantim is considering buying the Cimpor stake held by
Caixa Geral de Depositos SA under its right of first refusal,
said the two people. Caixa said in a statement it would sell the
9.6 percent holding to Camargo if Votorantim doesn’t exercise
its right.  Camargo Correa and Votorantim bought stakes in Cimpor in
early 2010, helping derail a hostile bid for the Portuguese
company by Brazilian steelmaker Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
