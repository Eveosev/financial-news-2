The German parliament’s upper
house, which represents the country’s federal states, made the
Schmallenberg livestock virus a notifiable disease, meaning
authorities have a legal obligation to report cases, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  As other European countries report new cases of the
disease, the ministry has called for a European requirement to
report outbreaks, it said in a  statement  on its website today.  The country had 1,117 farms with confirmed cases of the
livestock virus as of yesterday, according to a report by the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut. The virus, named after the German
town where it was first identified in November, causes
stillbirths and deformed offspring in sheep and cattle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
