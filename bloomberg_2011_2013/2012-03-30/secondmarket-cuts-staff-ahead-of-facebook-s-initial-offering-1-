SecondMarket Inc., the marketplace
for stock of private companies such as Facebook Inc. and Twitter
Inc., fired 10 percent of its employees today ahead of
Facebook’s anticipated initial public offering this year, the
company said.  New York-based SecondMarket employed 150 people before the
cuts, according to a spokeswoman. SecondMarket’s last auction of
Facebook stock will take place on April 3, said a person with
knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the
information is private.  “In a post-Facebook market world, we have decided to
eliminate some positions that are no longer core to our
company’s long-term mission,” SecondMarket said in an e-mailed
statement. The company will continue to hire in some areas, it
said.  Facebook, which announced plans for a $5 billion IPO in
February, accounted for “a meaningful proportion of the revenue
last year” for private-company stock trades arranged by
SecondMarket, Chief Executive Officer  Barry Silbert  said at a
Jan. 17 briefing. Besides facilitating private stock trades,
SecondMarket also helps match buyers and sellers for other
thinly traded investments such as asset-backed securities and
bankruptcy claims.  SharesPost Stock  Smaller rival SharesPost Inc. plans to expand headcount to
about 50 by the end of this year from less than 30 currently,
President and founder Greg Brogger said in a phone interview
today.  “We’ve had a significant increase in business and
certainly a big part of that has been in Facebook, but we’ve
also seen an increase in the transaction activity across
multiple companies,” Brogger said.  San Bruno, California-based SharesPost conducts private-
company stock transactions in about 40 companies, according to
Brogger. SharesPost conducted its final auction of Facebook
stock this week, bring the total amount of the company’s equity
sold on the platform to $425 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
