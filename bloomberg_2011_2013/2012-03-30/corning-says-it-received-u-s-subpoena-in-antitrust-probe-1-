Corning Inc. (GLW) , a maker of flat-panel
television glass and diesel engine filters, received a subpoena
from a U.S. grand jury investigating possible automotive product
antitrust violations, it said in a regulatory filing.  The company, based in Corning,  New York , made the
disclosure in a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The grand jury is reviewing evidence
gathered by the U.S. Justice Department in a Detroit-based
federal court, according to the  filing .  The probe concerns catalytic converters, diesel particulate
filters and related products, Corning said in the filing.  “The company’s policy is to comply with all laws and
regulations including all antitrust and competition laws,”
according to the filing. “Currently the company cannot estimate
the ultimate financial impact, if any, resulting from the
investigation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
