(Corrects percentage change in prices in third paragraph.)  U.S. farmers will sow 11 percent
fewer acres with cotton this year, less than analysts expected,
as they seek higher profit from soybeans and corn, the
Department of Agriculture said.  About 13.155 million acres (5.32 million hectares) will be
planted, down from 14.732 million last year, the USDA said today
in a report based on a survey of farmers. Analysts and traders
were expecting a 12 percent decline to 12.997 million, according
to a Bloomberg survey.  Cotton futures have plunged 58 percent since reaching a
record $2.197 a pound on March 7, 2011, as production climbed
and demand slowed. Yesterday, the contract for May delivery
dropped 0.5 percent to 93.54 cents a pound.  This quarter, soybean futures surged 16 percent, the
biggest gain since the end of 2010. Corn prices rose this month
to the highest since September.  “Soybeans and corn typically compete with cotton when it
comes to acreage,” Sterling Smith, a market analyst with
 Country Hedging , a broker in  St. Paul , Minnesota, said in a
telephone interview before the report.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest exporter of cotton and the
third-largest producer after China and  India .  Texas Acreage  Last year, crops in  Texas , the biggest producing state,
were decimated by the worst drought in at least a century.  “Hot weather in West Texas” is also deterring farmers
from investing in the fiber,  Michael Smith , the president of T&K
Futures and Options Inc. in  Port St. Lucie , Florida, said in an
e-mail.  Texas may plant 6.813 million acres, down from 7.570
million last year, the USDA said.  Georgia , the second-largest
grower, will plant about 1.4 million acres, down from 1.6
million in 2011, according to the department.  “Corn and soybeans have to look very attractive” in the
Mississippi Delta region, Jordan Lea, the chairman of
Greenville, Eastern Trading Co., a Greenville, South Carolina-
based exporter, said in an e-mail. Lea is a former president of
the American Cotton Shippers Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
