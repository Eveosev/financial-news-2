U.S. corn  acreage  this year will be
the largest since 1937, and more than expected, as profit
prospects improve and warm, dry weather encourages farmers to
boost plantings, the government said. Soybean acres are forecast
to fall while wheat seeding may climb.  About 95.864 million acres will be planted with corn, up
4.3 percent from 91.921 million last year and more than the
94.658 million expected by analysts, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report based on a farmer survey.
Farm net income may total $91.7 billion this year, the second
highest on record, the USDA said last month.  At current prices, farmers in some parts of the Midwest can
make more than twice as much from an acre of corn as from
soybeans, according to AgStar Financial in Rochester,  Minnesota .
In  Illinois , the biggest corn-growing state after  Iowa , farmers
have already started seeding following recent record high
temperatures, the USDA said earlier this week.  “With the early spring and relatively high prices, we’re
going to get even more total crop area planted,”  Richard Feltes , a vice president of research for R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, said by telephone from  Chicago . “If April and May
continue the above-normal temperature pattern, and precipitation
will largely be normal to below normal, that’s the perfect
formula for rapid early planting and maxing out the total
planted area.”  Farmers may sow 73.902 million acres in soybeans, down 1.4
percent from 74.976 million last year and less than the 75.429
million expected by analysts. Seeding of wheat, including spring
and winter varieties, may total 55.908 million acres, up 2.8
percent from 54.409 million a year earlier and lower than
analyst expectations of 57.551 million.  Food Costs  The USDA said in February that rising acreage may push U.S.
corn production to a record, capping food inflation. Global  food 
costs rose to an all-time high in February 2011, spurring unrest
in northern  Africa  and the  Middle East . Corn futures touched a
six-month high at $6.7575 a bushel on March 19 on the Chicago
Board of Trade. In June, the grain climbed to a record $7.9975
as U.S. stockpiles slid to a 16-year low.  At current prices, farmers in southern Minnesota can make
about $130 per acre of corn, compared with about $60 per acre of
soybeans, because corn crops yield more, said Tom Neher, a vice
president at lender AgStar Financial. Soybean futures have
surged 20 percent since the end of November, as adverse weather
threatened South American crops. Four months ago, before the
rally, farmers would have lost $60 per acre on the oilseed,
Neher said.  ‘More Profit’  “Soybeans have worked really hard to buy back more
acres,” said Neher, who helps manage AgStar’s grain portfolio,
worth $2.1 billion in loans and leases to farmers. “Soybeans
are more in favor now than they were earlier, but there’s still
a lot more profit to be made in corn.”  Farmers from Minnesota to  Washington  may plant 11.976
million acres in spring wheat, down from 12.394 million last
year, the USDA said. Analysts expected 13.35 million acres of
the grain, used to make bread and pizza dough. Durum wheat, used
in pasta, may be planted on 2.223 million acres, up from 1.369
million last year, when floods swamped fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
