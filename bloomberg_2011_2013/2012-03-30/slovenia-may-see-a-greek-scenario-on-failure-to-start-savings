Slovenia may see a Greek scenario
developing for its public finances if the euro-region nation
fails to adopt savings measures, central bank Governor Marko Kranjec said in an interview with Delo newspaper.  “If we don’t get serious and adopt savings measures, we
may see a similar scenario that the Greeks are going through,
when measures will be dictated by foreigners,” Kranjec said in
the interview with the Ljubljana-based newspaper. “It’s better
to do it ourselves than have these measures enforced from
outside the country.”  The government of Prime Minister  Janez Jansa  proposed to
cut spending by about 800 million euros ($1.07 billion), which
will help narrow the budget gap to below 3 percent by the end of
the year after the shortfall widened to 6.4 percent last year,
according to the Slovenian statistics office.  “At the last session of the  European Central Bank  in
Frankfurt we have also discussed an analysis on the quality of
the statistics of public finances,” Kranjec, who’s also a
member of the ECB’s Governing Council, said. “Slovenia along
with  Greece  was pointed out as the country where the reliability
and the quality of budget deficit data is problematic.”  Kranjec said the Slovenian economy is forecast to shrink
1.2 percent this year. That compares with the 0.9 percent
estimate by the government’s economic institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
