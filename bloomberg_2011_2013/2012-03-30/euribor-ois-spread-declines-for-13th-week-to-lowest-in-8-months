European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another fell for the thirteenth week to the lowest in
eight months as the region’s governments moved to bolster rescue
funds.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 41 basis
points at 11:50 a.m. in  London , from 42 yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The measure has fallen every week this year
to the lowest level since Aug. 3.  Finance ministers neared an agreement to run the temporary
European Financial Stability Facility in parallel with the
permanent European Stability Mechanism until mid-2013, lifting
the maximum aid sum from 500 billion euros ($667 billion). The
 European Central Bank ’s so-called longer-term refinancing
operations, or LTROs, have also cut bank borrowing costs.  “We’ve seen the slow and steady decline of the Euribor-OIS
spread since the first LTRO,” said  Brian Barry , a strategist at
Investec Bank Plc in London. “Recent progress in talks to
increase the size of the euro zone firewalls has also
contributed to the decline in the spread.”  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars fell for the fourth week with the three-month cross-
currency  basis swap  at 50.5 basis points below Euribor. The cost
reached an eight-month low of minus 49.5 on March 26.  The one-year basis swap was 45 basis points less than
Euribor, from minus 44 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday
to 786 billion euros, up from 777 billion euros on March 28.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.777 percent from 0.783 percent.
One-week Euribor fell to 0.316 percent from 0.317 percent.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.468 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
