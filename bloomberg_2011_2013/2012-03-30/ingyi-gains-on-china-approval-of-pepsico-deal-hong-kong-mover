Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding
Corp. (322) , China’s biggest maker of packaged food, climbed in  Hong
Kong  trading after getting government approval to swap a stake
for PepsiCo Inc.’s bottling operations in China.  The stock rose 3.7 percent to HK$22.45 at the 4 p.m. close
in Hong Kong. The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 0.3 percent.  China’s Ministry of Commerce yesterday approved a deal that
PepsiCo and Tingyi announced last November, Tingyi Chief
Financial Officer Frank Lin said over the phone. Under the
 agreement , Tingyi’s beverage subsidiary, Tingyi-Asahi Beverages
Holding, will become Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo’s
franchise bottler in China. It will also make, sell and
distribute PepsiCo’s carbonated soft-drink and Gatorade brands.  PepsiCo will transfer equity interests in bottling
operations in  China  to Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding.  In exchange, Pepsico will receive 5 percent of Tingyi-
Asahi, with an option to increase the stake to 20 percent by
October 2015.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
