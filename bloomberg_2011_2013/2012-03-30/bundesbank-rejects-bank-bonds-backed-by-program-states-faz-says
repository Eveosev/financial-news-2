Germany ’s Bundesbank is the first
of the 17 euro-area central banks to refuse to accept as
collateral bank bonds guaranteed by member states receiving aid
from the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund ,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported.  The Bundesbank won’t lend to banks against bank debt
guaranteed by Greece, Ireland and Portugal from May, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified officials. The Frankfurt-
based central bank currently has less than 500 million euros
($667 million) of those bonds on its balance sheet, FAZ
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
