Yuan forwards advanced after a
Chinese manufacturing gauge rose to a one-year high and Vice
Premier  Li Keqiang  said the economy’s fundamentals are sound.  A  Purchasing Managers ’  Index (CPMINDX)  increased to 53.1 in March,
 China ’s logistics federation and the National Bureau of
Statistics said yesterday. That exceeded analysts’ median
forecast of 50.8 and a reading of 51 in February. Li, speaking
at the Boao Forum in the southern Hainan province, said he sees
stable and fast development in the long-term for China, which
will maintain growth and stabilize prices.  “China is not expecting a hard landing,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.
“The first quarter could be the bottom in sequential growth.
There’ll be a rebound in the offshore yuan.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.12 percent to
6.3250 per dollar as of 3:56 p.m. in  Hong Kong , a 0.4 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate on March 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts touched 6.3225, the
strongest level since March 23. Financial markets in China are
closed for public holidays and will reopen on April 5.  The yuan gained 0.02 percent to 6.3108 in Hong Kong. The
currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
