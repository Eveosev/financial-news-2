Oil options volatility was little
changed as the underlying futures rose after reports showed U.S.
consumer sentiment and spending increased and President  Barack
Obama  cleared the way for sanctions targeting  Iran .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 24.98 percent as of 3:25 p.m. on the New
York Mercantile Exchange versus 24.99 percent yesterday.  Crude futures advanced 24 cents to settle at $103.02 a
barrel on the Nymex.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were

with 3,803 contracts trading. May $110 calls were the second-
most active with 2,582 lots changing hands. They rose 1 cent to
35 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading volume.
