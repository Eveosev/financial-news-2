SIF Oltenia SA (SIF5) , a Romanian
investment fund, is seeking a higher price for a minority stake
in Banca Comerciala Romana SA after it agreed last year to sell
it to  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , the bank’s owner,  Ziarul Financiar 
reported, citing unidentified people in the market.  The fund increased its stake in BCR to 6.58 percent from
6.1 percent after adding 8 million euros ($11 million) to the
bank’s capital last year and now plans to renegotiate a deal
with the Austrian lender for the share sale, according to the
Bucharest-based newspaper.  Erste agreed last September to pay 124 million lei in cash
and swap some BCR shares with its own to each of the five
Romanian funds, known as SIFs, that agrees to sell its 6 percent
stake in the Romanian lender. The SIFs would hold a 6 percent
stake in Erste following the share swap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
