Portugal ’s  budget deficit  last year
was 4.2 percent of gross domestic product, less than half of the
9.8 percent shortfall reported for 2010, the country’s
statistics institute said.  Portugal’s debt was 107.8 percent of GDP in 2011 and is
forecast to reach 112.5 percent of GDP in 2012, the Lisbon-based
National Statistics Institute said in a statement today. Debt
was 93.3 percent of GDP in 2010.  The  government  previously said the budget gap narrowed to
about 4 percent of GDP in 2011 following the transfer of banks’
pension funds to the state. It expects the shortfall to reach
4.5 percent of GDP in 2012 and the European Union ceiling of 3
percent in 2013.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and
raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($104
billion) aid plan from the EU and the  International Monetary
Fund . As the country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal followed
Greece and Ireland in April in seeking a bailout and now plans
to return to bond markets in 2013.  The IMF expects Portugal’s ratio of debt to GDP will
“stabilize” at about 115 percent in 2013 and then gradually
decline, Abebe Aemro Selassie, the head of the fund’s aid
mission to the country, said on March 5.  The government must implement the spending cuts and tax
increases in a shrinking economy that has grown less than 1
percent a year on average in the past decade. The Portuguese
economy will  contract  3.3 percent this year, the European
Commission forecast on Feb. 23. By comparison, the 17-nation
euro economy is seen shrinking 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
