The Obama administration expects
 Turkey  to reduce its imports of Iranian oil, Francis
Riccardione, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey, was quoted as saying
by  Haberturk  newspaper.  Other countries have cut Iranian oil imports amid efforts
to ratchet up pressure on the country for its nuclear program,
and the U.S. expects Turkey to do the same, Riccardione was
quoted as saying yesterday at a conference on Turkish-U.S.
relations in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
