Norwegian retail sales surged at
more than twice the estimated pace after the central bank cut
interest rates and as record oil spending boosts employment.  Sales, excluding motor vehicles and petrol stations, rose
7.4 percent in February from a year earlier, the Oslo-based
statistics office said today. They were estimated to rise an
annual 2.7 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of four
analysts. They rose 1.1 percent in the month.  The world’s seventh-largest oil exporter is rebounding as
rising crude oil prices fuel investments in the nation’s
offshore industry. The central bank, or Norges Bank, this month
lowered its main  interest rate  for a second time since December
to support growth and avoid excessive gains in the krone.  “This points in the direction of higher rates and
strengthens our belief that Norges Bank will reverse the March
rate cut already in August,” said Knut Magnussen, an economist
at DNB ASA in Oslo, in a note to clients.  A report today also showed Norwegian manufacturing
accelerated at the fastest pace since October 2007 in March. A
seasonally adjusted index based on responses from  purchasing
managers  rose to 59.7 from a revised 56.7 in February, Oslo-
based Fokus Bank said. A reading above 50 signals an expansion.  The country’s registered jobless rate fell in March to 2.6
percent from 2.7 percent in February, the Oslo-based Labor and
Welfare Organization said yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
