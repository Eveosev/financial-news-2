Serbia’s gross domestic product
grew 0.4 percent in the last quarter of 2011, and the full-year
expansion slowed to 1.6 percent as exports and investment
declined on  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The fourth-quarter and the 2011 full-year GDP data was
revised today from 0.8 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, in
a Jan. 31 flash estimate by the Belgrade-based  Statistical
Office .  Expansion in energy and mining, construction, information
technologies and communications barely compensated the
contraction in manufacturing industries, trade, banking and
insurance, real estate, the report showed.  Serbia is heavily reliant on trade and financial links with
the European Union, and the sovereign-debt crisis in the euro
area has weakened demand for its exports. The government sees
the economy growing by 0.5 percent at best this year, in line
with existing International Monetary Fund’s forecasts.  This year’s GDP estimates may worsen after an almost 13
percent industrial output decline in February, a month of
freezing weather and heavy snowfall that kept many industries
out of work for days. The IMF will update the forecast for
 Serbia  by mid-April, as part of its World Economic Outlook, IMF
resident representative Bogdan Lissovolik said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
