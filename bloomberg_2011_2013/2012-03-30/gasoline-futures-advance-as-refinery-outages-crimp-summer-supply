Gasoline had its biggest quarterly
gain in a year on speculation that refinery closures and
seasonal repairs will trim supply of summer-grade fuel in the
eastern U.S. at a time when demand typically rises.  Futures slipped today as traders settled positions in the
April contract, which expired at the end of floor trading.
Gasoline has increased 26 percent this year, the most of any
contract in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.  “As expiration unfolds you have to keep an eye out for
what side of the market tips the scales,” said  Gene McGillian ,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “It looks as if some longs are finally bailing and
that is why gasoline has dipped.”  Gasoline for April delivery fell 1.07 cents, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3.3899 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices were little changed this week, and
increased 11 percent in March. The more actively traded May
contract lost 3.16 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $3.3081.  East Coast refining capacity declined 36 percent from July,
leaving gasoline  supply  in the region at an 11-week low,
according to Energy Department data.  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  have idled gasoline-making units for repairs at the first-
and third-largest U.S. refineries. Fuel used in warmer weather
has to meet more stringent emissions standards, making it more
costly to produce.  “We have seen over the last couple weeks a gasoline
inventory draw, as well as a number of longer-than-expected cat
cracker turnarounds on the Gulf Coast impacting supply,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Supplies Decline  Stockpiles of the fuel dropped 1.8 million barrels in the
seven days ended March 23 to 58.7 million in Padd 1, the Energy
Department said March 28. The region includes New York Harbor,
the delivery point for Nymex gasoline reformulated blendstock,
or RBOB contract. Demand increased 4 percent to 8.71 million
barrels a day, the highest level since December.  The government calculated operable refinery  capacity  in the
region at 1.19 million barrels a day, down from 1.62 million in
July. Sunoco Inc. and ConocoPhillips have shut two plants in
Pennsylvania and Sunoco may idle a third by July that together
can process more than 700,000 barrels a day of oil.  April Premium  The premium of April over May futures rose to 8.18 cents a
gallon as traders were willing to pay more for delivery sooner,
a market structure known as backwardation. It was the largest
such gap between the two contracts nearest to expiration since
September.  “With gasoline seeing support from supply worries, that
continues to be the dominant theme in the market,” said
McGillian.  BP shut fluid catalytic cracker No. 3 in January for work
at the 475,000-barrel-a-day Texas City, Texas, plant, the third-
largest in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter said at
the time. Exxon idled a similar unit at the beginning of
February at the 584,000-barrel-a-day Baytown refinery, the
nation’s largest.  Prices also surged in the first quarter as bullish bets by
 hedge funds   increased  for 11 consecutive weeks through March 6
to 92,600 contracts of futures and options, the highest level in
Commodities Futures Trading Commission data since 2006. The net-
long position decreased to 88,539 contracts through March 27.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.4
cent yesterday to $3.925 a gallon, according to AAA, the
nation’s biggest motoring club. Prices, which have surged 20
percent this year and 5 percent this month, were 9.2 percent
above a year earlier.  April-delivery heating oil added 0.95 cent, or 0.3 percent,
to settle at $3.1684 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices, which
slipped 1.3 percent this week and 0.6 percent this month, gained
8 percent in the first quarter. The May contract increased 0.03
cent to $3.1701.  To contact the reporter on this story:
