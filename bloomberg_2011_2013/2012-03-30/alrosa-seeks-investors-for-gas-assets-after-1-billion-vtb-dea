OAO Alrosa,  Russia ’s government-run
diamond company, will seek investors for its natural-gas assets
after repurchasing them from VTB Group for $1.04 billion.  State-run VTB bought Geotransgaz and Urengoy Gas Co. assets
from Alrosa in 2009 to help the producer through the financial
crisis. Alrosa has hired VTB Capital to advise on developing the
projects and attracting strategic investors, it said today in a
statement. The company has a preliminary deal to sell 25 percent
to 26 percent to state oil and gas producer OAO Zarubezhneft.  The assets have resources of 187 billion cubic meters of
natural gas and 26.4 million metric tons of gas condensate in
northern Russia’s Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, Alrosa
said. It may start output of 1.8 billion cubic meters of gas and
250,000 tons of condensate a year from the fourth quarter.  Output is seen reaching a maximum annual 4 billion cubic
meters of gas and 1 million tons of gas condensate, the producer
said. Alrosa decided last year to focus on diamond mining and
sell other assets including  iron ore  and natural-gas projects.  The diamond producer announced today that it completed the
purchase of 100 percent of the gas assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
