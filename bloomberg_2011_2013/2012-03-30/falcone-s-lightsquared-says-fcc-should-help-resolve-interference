Philip Falcone ’s  LightSquared Inc. (SKYT) 
said regulators should help find a resolution to interference
concerns rather than block the proposed wireless service.  The U.S. Federal Communications Commission can “find a way
forward that enables LightSquared to operate,”  Jeff Carlisle ,
executive vice president for the Reston, Virginia-based company,
said in a conference call today.  The FCC last month said it would block LightSquared after
the Obama administration found the service would disrupt
navigation gear. Comments on the FCC’s proposed action were due
today.  The agency should go ahead and rescind LightSquared’s
authorization, Jim Kirkland, general counsel of navigation gear
maker  Trimble Navigation Ltd. (TRMB) , said in an e-mail.  At issue are plans to let LightSquared operate a network of
ground-based towers over airwaves previously reserved mainly for
satellites.  Users and makers of global-positioning system gear say the
network would cause interference. LightSquared says the GPS
industry has produced defective equipment that improperly
captures its signals.  LightSquared failed to show it won’t cause interference and
is seeking “changes in the rules after the game is over,”
Kirkland said in the statement issued by the Coalition to Save
Our GPS. The group formed to oppose LightSquared’s plans
includes Trimble, package shippers  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and United Parcel
Service Inc., GPS-unit maker  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) , Delta Air Lines Inc.
and Southwest Airlines Co., and farm-equipment maker  Deere & Co. (DE)   Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  on March 16 said it canceled an
agreement to help build LightSquared’s network, adding to
concern about the venture’s viability and the fate of Falcone’s
$3 billion investment in the business through his  Harbinger
Capital Partners (SKYT)  hedge fund.  LightSquared has hired litigators as it gears up for a
possible legal battle with regulators.  Tammy Sun, an FCC spokeswoman, didn’t provide a comment.  Harbinger managed $4 billion at the end of last year, down
from a peak of $26 billion in mid-2008. It wrote down its
LightSquared position by 59 percent last year because of the
uncertainty over LightSquared approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
