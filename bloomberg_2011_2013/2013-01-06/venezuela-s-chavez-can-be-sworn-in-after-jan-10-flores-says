Venezuela’s  Hugo Chavez  already holds
the office of the presidency and can be sworn in before the
Supreme Court when he returns from Cuba, where he is being
treated after a fourth cancer operation, Attorney General Cilia
Flores said.  Chavez is scheduled to be sworn in for a new six-year term,
after winning the Oct. 7 vote, on Jan. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
