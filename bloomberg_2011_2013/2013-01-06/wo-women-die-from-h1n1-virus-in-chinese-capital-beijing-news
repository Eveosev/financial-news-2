Two women have died from the H1N1 flu
strain in Beijing in the past two weeks, the Beijing News
 reported , citing the city’s health authorities.  The number of flu cases in  China ’s capital is at its
highest level since 2008, according to the article, which was
posted on the website of the Beijing Centers for Diseases
Control and Prevention. The pandemic H1N1 virus, also known as
swine flu, was the most common strain, it said.  A 22-year-old woman developed symptoms on Dec. 25 and
passed away shortly after. The second patient, a 65-year-old
woman in the late stages of cancer, died on Jan. 4, Beijing News
reported.  The public shouldn’t worry because the virus has become a
“seasonal strain” that can be controlled and prevented, the
agency was quoted as saying in the article.  Swine flu spread quickly in China in 2009, prompting mass
inoculations by the Asian nation. The H1N1 virus was responsible
for an estimated 659 deaths as of Jan. 2, 2010, China’s health
ministry said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
