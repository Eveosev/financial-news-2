China started construction of a 3
billion  yuan  ($481 million) nuclear power reactor last month,
the  Xinhua News Agency  reported today, citing the Chinese energy
company in charge of the project.  The reactor, which is being built at Shidao Bay in the
eastern province of Shandong, will start generating power by the
end of 2017 and will have capacity of 200 megawatts, Xinhua
said, quoting the operator of the plant, Huaneng Shandong Shidao
Bay Nuclear Power Co..  China’s State Council approved a nuclear power safety plan
and a development schedule for the industry in October,
effectively lifting a ban on new projects in place since an
earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant in
 Japan  in 2011. The world’s largest energy consumer is seeking to
more than triple its nuclear power capacity to 40 million
kilowatts in 2015 from 12.54 million kilowatts at the end of
2011, according to a government white paper released Oct. 24.  State-owned power generator China Huaneng Group Corp.,
China Nuclear Engineering Group Co., and  Tsinghua University  are
investors in the project which is part of a plan by the three to
build a 6.6 gigawatt nuclear power plant that will require
investment of 100 billion yuan over 20 years, Xinhua reported.
That project, which includes the construction of five
pressurized water reactors, is still awaiting regulatory
approval, it said.  The high temperature gas-cooled reactor to be used in the
Shidao Bay project, developed by Beijing’s Tsinghua University,
will have features that will allow it to safely shut down during
emergencies without causing the core of the reactor to melt down
or a “massive leakage” of radioactive material, Xinhua said,
citing the statement from Huaneng Shandong Shidao.  If commercially successful, the technology and equipment
will be exported to other countries, helping to boost the
country’s nuclear industry, Xinhua said, citing a company
official it didn’t identify.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
