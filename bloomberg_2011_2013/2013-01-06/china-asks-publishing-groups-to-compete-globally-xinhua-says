China  wants its media and publishing
groups to compete globally by reforming operations, promoting
their products overseas and buying equity stakes in businesses,
according to the official Xinhua News Agency.  Regulators will help the country’s leading publishers to
enter the global market and “expand the influence of Chinese
culture,” Xinhua reported yesterday, citing Jiang Jianguo,
deputy director of  the General Administration of Press and
Publication . Chinese media companies should “participate in
global competition by setting up branches and publications
overseas through share-buying and other methods,” Jiang said.  Chinese state media have been boosting overseas operations,
particularly in the U.S. State-owned China Central Television
set up a new English-language channel known as CCTV America last
year which airs on cable and satellite and operates from its
base in  Washington , D.C. The channel seeks to “project China
and more closely connect Asia and America,” according to its
 website .  Xinhua itself began an English-language edition in  North
America  in 2010 and announced a year later the opening of its
U.S. headquarters in Times Square,  New York . The number of
Chinese reporters working overseas is also growing. The U.S.
issued 868 visas to Chinese journalists in 2011, up from 616 the
prior year, according to the U.S. Department of State.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
