The  National Hockey League  and its
players’ union reached agreement on the framework for a new
collective bargaining contract, ending a lockout that began
Sept. 16 and has wiped out about half the schedule.  “We have reached an agreement on a new collective
bargaining agreement, the details of which still need to be put
to paper,” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in comments
posted on the league’s website.  Bettman said he didn’t know when the season would start or
how many games each team would play.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
