Argentina ’s government repudiated
comments by U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  that his military
is prepared to defend the Falkland Islands if necessary, saying
he should instead focus on creating jobs in Europe.  The Foreign Ministry asked Cameron “not to use the
legitimate and peaceful claims we make against the usurpation of
part of our territory and against colonialism as an excuse to
continue to support the arms industry rather than alleviate the
severe social crisis that is sweeping Europe,” according to a
statement e-mailed today. “People need more work and fewer
wars.”  The U.K. and Argentina went to war in 1982 over the islands
that lie off the South American country’s coast. In an open
letter to Cameron published in U.K. and U.S. newspapers on Jan.
3, Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said he
should abide by a 1960 United Nations resolution urging member
states to “end colonialism in all its forms.” Britain should
begin negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands, which
were “forcibly stripped” from Argentina 180 years ago, she
told the prime minister.  Cameron made his comments about the Falklands today on  BBC
Television ’s “The Andrew Marr Show.”  “I get regular reports on this entire issue because I want
to know that our defenses are strong,” he said. “Our resolve
is extremely strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
