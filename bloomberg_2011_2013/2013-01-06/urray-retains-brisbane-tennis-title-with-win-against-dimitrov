Andy Murray  warmed up for this
month’s Australian Open with a straight-sets win against Grigor
Dimitrov yesterday to retain his Brisbane International tennis
title.  The 25-year-old Scot,  ranked No. 3  on the ATP World Tour,
won 7-6 (7-0) 6-4 against his 48th-ranked opponent as he
collected a 25th career title. He came back in each set to beat
Bulgaria’s Dimitrov, 21, who was playing in his first final.  “He plays a lot of different shots, which is tough to play
against because you’re kept off balance a lot of the time,”
Murray said in comments on the ATP website.  Murray, the top seed in Brisbane, was broken in his opening
service game and then had to save a set point at 5-6 before
sweeping a tie-break.  Dimitrov, who will climb to a career-high ranking of No.
39, had a break in the seventh game of the second set before
Murray won three straight games to end his resistance.  Murray dedicated his victory to a sick friend, whom he
didn’t name. The Lawn Tennis Association, the sport’s governing
body in the U.K.,  said  British player Ross Hutchins has been
diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a form of cancer.  Hutchins, 27, is ranked No. 28 in the world in doubles and
has previously partnered Murray.  The Australian Open, the first of the year’s four Grand
Slam events, starts Jan. 14 in  Melbourne . Murray was runnerup in
2010 and 2011 and lost in the semifinals last year.  In September, he won the U.S. Open to become the first British
man to win a singles Grand Slam event in 76 years.   Williams Victory  Two days ago,  Serena Williams  of the U.S. beat Russia’s
