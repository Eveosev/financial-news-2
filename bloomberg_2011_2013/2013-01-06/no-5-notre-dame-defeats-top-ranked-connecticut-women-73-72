Kayla McBride scored a game-high 21
points to help fifth-ranked Notre Dame University upset No. 1
University of  Connecticut  73-72 in the  Big East  Conference
opener of college women’s basketball.  Skylar Diggins added 19 for the Fighting Irish (12-1, 1-0
Big East) last night at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs,
Connecticut.  “Skylar Diggins and Kayla McBride are both really good
guards,” said Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma, who has taken
the Huskies to seven national championships. “We were taking
over the game at one point, and then Diggins made two threes to
get them right back.”  Stefanie Dolson made a two-point layup with 16 minutes, 10
seconds left in the game to give Connecticut (12-1, 0-1 Big
East) a 48-44 lead. Diggins hit a 3-pointer 10 seconds later.
Connecticut’s Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis added two points and
Diggins tied the game 50-50 with another 3-pointer.  Diggins came back with 50 seconds remaining to hit two free
throws to give the Fighting Irish a 73-72 lead.  Mosqueda-Lewis missed a 3-point jumper with eight seconds
left. The Fighting Irish grabbed the rebound and let the clock
run out. Mosqueda-Lewis and Dolson each had 17 points for the
Huskies.  “You’ve got the best three-point shooter in the country
with a wide open three to win it and it doesn’t go in,”
Auriemma said. “I’d be more upset if we had the wrong player
take the wrong shot at the wrong time. I mean we came out of the
timeout, had the right shot, it just didn’t go in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
