The friction between General Stanley McChrystal and the White House that led to the former’s
resignation in 2010 emerged at the start of President  Barack Obama ’s first term, the  New York  Times reported, citing the
general’s memoir.  In “My Share of the Task: A Memoir,” set for release on
Jan. 7, McChrystal said that a “deficit of trust” existed from
the beginning over war strategy and troop levels in  Afghanistan ,
the Times reported.  McChrystal, then commander of U.S. and NATO forces in
Afghanistan, was relieved of duty in June, 2010, following the
publication of disparaging remarks about the administration in a
Rolling Stone article.  McChrystal’s memoir strikes a “respectful” tone and
doesn’t outline the meeting at which he tendered his
resignation, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
