The euro rose for a second day
against the dollar, reversing earlier losses, after failing to
drop below its 50-day moving average.  The 17-nation currency advanced from almost a three-week
low after avoiding the $1.2993 level. The euro fell earlier
before the  European Central Bank  meets this week amid concern
the region’s economy is faltering. The yen gained from almost
the weakest in 29 months versus the dollar even amid bets
Japan’s government will announce further stimulus.  “The euro simply didn’t break much lower and stayed quite
nicely around the $1.30 level,”  Sebastien Galy , a senior
foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in  New York ,
said in a radio interview on “Bloomberg on the Economy” with
Sara Eisen and Scarlet Fu. “The temptation therefore is to try
to push it a little bit higher.”  The euro appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.3117 at 5 p.m. New
York time after falling earlier to $1.3017. It touched $1.2998
on Jan. 4, the lowest level since Dec. 12. The yen gained 0.4
percent to 87.79 per dollar, rising against most major peers,
after declining to 88.41 on Jan. 4, the weakest level since July
15, 2010. The Japanese currency traded little changed at 115.15
to the euro.  It was the second straight day  Europe ’s shared currency
failed to breach its 50-day moving average versus the dollar.
The calculations, which indicate momentum, are seen by some
traders as potential turning points in the direction of a
currency’s price.  Technical Level  The euro also remained above $1.2985, the 50 percent
retracement of its advance from $1.2662 on Nov. 13 to $1.3308 on
Dec. 19, strategists at Credit Suisse Group AG wrote in a client
note, citing Fibonacci analysis. That leaves the euro poised to
rally to $1.3309, the highest since April, they wrote. Fibonacci
analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  “The focus is shifting higher once more, and we envisage a
recovery,” the analysts including Cilline Bain in  London  wrote.  The euro strengthened 1 percent over the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The  U.S. dollar  dropped 0.6
percent and the yen tumbled 7.3 percent.  The  Dollar Index , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the U.S. currency, fell for the first time in four
days. It lost 0.4 percent to 80.203 in its biggest drop on a
closing basis since Dec. 14.  Kiwi Climbs  New Zealand ’s dollar gained versus all of its 16 most-
traded counterparts amid speculation Japan will boost spending
to bolster its economy. The currency, nicknamed the kiwi,
rallied 0.7 percent to 83.71 U.S. cents.  A gauge of price swings remained below average. JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s G7  Volatility Index , based on three-month options
for Group of Seven currencies, was at 7.77 percent after
touching 7.54 percent on Jan. 3, the lowest level since Dec. 21.
The average in 2012 was 9.23 percent.  Lower volatility makes investments in currencies with
higher benchmark  interest rates  more attractive as the risk in
such trades is that market moves will erase profits.  The euro region’s economy is forecast to shrink 0.1 percent
this year after a 0.4 percent drop in 2012, its first
contraction since 2009, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The U.S. may grow 2 percent,
compared with 2.2 percent in 2012.  More ‘Discerning’  “The risk-on, risk-off dynamic has morphed into a little
bit more of a discerning currency-by-currency analysis,”  Thomas Molloy , chief dealer at FX Solutions LLC, an online currency-
trading company in Saddle River,  New Jersey , said in a telephone
interview. “There’s a little bit of an expectation that this
year, 2013, will be the year that currencies that have good news
will have strong currencies, currencies with bad news will have
weaker currencies -- rather than the close-your-eyes and risk-
on, risk-off trade that we had in 2012.”  The ECB meets Jan. 10 and will keep its main  refinancing
rate  at a record low of 0.75 percent, according to the median
estimate of 55 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The  Bank of England  also is to meet on Jan. 10, and another
survey projected it will keep its  key rate  at 0.5 percent.  “We may just be in a bit of consolidation ahead of these
central-bank meetings,” Eric Viloria, senior currency
strategist at Gain Capital Group LLC, said in a phone interview.  The yen rallied after falling against the dollar for eight
consecutive weeks amid speculation  Japan ’s newly elected prime
minister, Shinzo Abe, will boost efforts to spur growth.  The government will announce 12 trillion yen ($137 billion)
of fiscal stimulus this month to boost the nation’s shrinking
economy, the Yomiuri newspaper said today.  The yen’s 14-day relative strength index versus the dollar
dropped to 15.5 on Jan. 4, below the level of 30 that some
traders view as a signal an asset has fallen too fast. The index
was 20.9 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
