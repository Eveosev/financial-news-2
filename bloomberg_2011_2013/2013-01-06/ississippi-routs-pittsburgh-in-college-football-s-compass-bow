Bo Wallace passed for three
touchdowns as the University of  Mississippi  defeated the
University of Pittsburgh 38-17 in college football’s BBVA
Compass Bowl.  Wallace helped the Rebels earn a 24-10 halftime lead
yesterday as he connected with Ja-Mes Logan, Randall Mackey and
Vince Sanders for touchdowns. Bryson Rose added a 31-yard field
goal at Legion Field in Birmingham,  Alabama .  Mississippi ended this season 7-6, a five-win improvement
over its 2-10 record in 2011.  “I’ve tried to learn not to make too much out of a single
game either way, but no question this advances our journey a
bit,” said Mississippi coach Hugh Freeze. “To be where we’re
sitting here Year One far surpasses certainly the
prognosticators and whatever they had for us.”  Tino Sunseri threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Devin Street
and Kevin Harper kicked a 47-yard field goal in the first two
quarters for the Panthers (6-7, 3-4  Big East ).  Barry Brunetti dashed one yard for a touchdown in the third
quarter and I’Tavius Mathers ran 62 yards for a fourth-quarter
score for the Rebels (7-6, 3-5 SEC).  Sunseri ended the game with a 16-yard scoring pass to  Mike
Shanahan  with two minutes, 23 seconds left in the fourth
quarter.  Wallace completed 22 of 32 passing attempts for 151 yards,
three touchdowns and two interceptions. Sunseri connected on 16
of 32 passes for 185 yards, two touchdowns and one interception.  To contact the reporter on this story:
