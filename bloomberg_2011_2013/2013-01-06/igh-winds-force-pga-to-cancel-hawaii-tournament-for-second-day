The PGA Tour’s Hyundai Tournament of
Champions was canceled for the second straight day when winds
pushed golf balls uphill on the greens at Kapalua in Maui, said
Slugger White, vice president of rules and operations.  The Hawaii tournament was shortened to 54 holes with 36
holes to be played today and 18 holes tomorrow, according to the
tour’s website.  “I dropped a ball on the 10th green, on the back of the
green, just dropped it and (it) rolled 20 yards off the front of
the green,” White said yesterday. “We did have balls that were
going uphill on 10 by a foot and a half (46 cm).”  To contact the reporter on this story:
