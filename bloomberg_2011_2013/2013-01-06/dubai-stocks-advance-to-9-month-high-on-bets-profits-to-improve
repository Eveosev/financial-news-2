Dubai’s shares climbed to a nine-
month high on bets some of the emirate’s biggest companies will
post full-year profit growth as the economy recovers.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, advanced to the highest level in almost three years.
Emirates NBD, the biggest United Arab Emirates bank by assets,
climbed 1.1 percent. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose 0.7 percent to
1,694.13, the highest since April 4, at the close in Dubai. The
measure added 4.4 percent last week after U.S. lawmakers passed
a bill averting the so-called fiscal cliff. Abu Dhabi shares
increased 0.9 percent today.  “Expectations for annual results are strong,” said Nabil Al Rantisi, managing director of brokerage at Abu Dhabi-based
Menacorp, who added that the U.S. budget news was also
supporting shares.  A revival in real estate, retail and tourism helped Dubai’s
economy expand 4.1 percent in the first half of 2012, putting
the emirate on track to reach the government’s 5 percent
forecast for the year, government data show. That would be the
fastest pace of growth since 2007. Emaar Properties, which has
the  heaviest weighting  on Dubai’s index, probably posted 15
percent growth in profit last year, according to the average
estimate of 11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Gulf Cooperation Council shares are luring investors as
they offer attractive valuations relative to emerging-market
peers, Franklin Templeton Investment Management Ltd. said last
week. Dubai’s measure, the best performer in the six-nation GCC
in 2012, trades at an estimated price-to-earnings ratio of 9.43
times, versus 11 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  Higher Profit  Emaar, which will probably report results on Feb. 14,
advanced 2.6 percent to 4.01 dirhams, the highest close since
April 2010. The stock rallied 46 percent in 2012, recovering
from two years of declines. Emirates NBD, which may report the
same day, gained to 2.88 dirhams, the highest level since Dec.
6. The bank’s  fourth-quarter profit  may triple, according to the
median estimate of three analysts on Bloomberg.  Dubai Financial Market PJSC (DFM) , the only publicly traded GCC
stock market, gained 0.9 percent as it said it will issue
guidelines for sukuk trading. Mortgage provider  Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) 
decreased 4.2 percent after  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  offered to
take over the company through a share swap. Tamweel shares,
which resumed trading in May 2011 after being suspended since
2008, will be delisted from the Dubai stock market after
completion of the takeover. Dubai Islamic shares decreased 1
percent.  Abu Dhabi Rally  Dubai’s 14-day  relative strength index  surged to 76 today.
A reading above 70 indicates to some analysts that a security or
index is poised to decline. About 322 million shares were traded
in Dubai today, compared with a 12-month daily average of 165
million.  Elsewhere in the GCC,  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  gained,

0.1 percent. In North Africa, the EGX 30 Index was little
changed.  Israel’s TA-25 Index gained 0.5 percent at 2:35 p.m. in  Tel
