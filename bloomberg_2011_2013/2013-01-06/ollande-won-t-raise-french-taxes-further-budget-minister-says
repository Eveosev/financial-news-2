France  won’t introduce any further
tax increases for the rest of President  Francois Hollande ’s
five-year term because companies and individuals need
“predictability” on their fiscal obligations, Budget Minister
Jerome Cahuzac said today in a radio interview on Europe 1.  The government will present revisions to its plan on taxing
the very rich by this autumn, after the Constitutional Council
struck down the 75 percent tax on incomes over 1 million euros
($1.3 million) on Dec. 29, Cahuzac said.  The court “didn’t condemn the idea but the way it was
being implemented,” he said. The government wants “to incite a
bit more prudence and decency in a few very rare executives” to
encourage companies to reduce the pay gap between management and
workers.  Cahuzac didn’t specify whether the new tax on the rich will
be limited to two years as the previous one was, saying that it
“could” last for Hollande’s full term. Hollande took office in
May last year.  Cahuzac maintained the 0.8 percent growth forecast for the
French economy this year, saying the government’s discipline in
sticking to its budget means the goal is “feasible.” He
reiterated Hollande’s statements yesterday that while the state
will help find a buyer for a Petroplus Holdings AG oil refinery,
nationalization isn’t an option.  Cahuzac also refuted a French press report that he has a
Swiss bank account, saying “I deny it in whole and in detail.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
