Global central bank chiefs gave lenders four more years to meet international liquidity requirements and watered down the measures in a bid to stave off another credit crunch.  Banks won the delay to fully meet the so-called liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, following a deal struck by regulatory chiefs meeting yesterday in Basel,  Switzerland . They’ll be able to pick from a longer list of approved assets including equities and securitized mortgage debt as they seek to build up buffers of liquidity for use in a financial crisis.  Bank shares soared after the decision to overhaul the proposed ratio, which top officials such as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  argued would choke interbank lending and make it harder for authorities to implement monetary policies. Lenders  have warned  that the measure might force them to cut back loans to businesses and households.  Lenders gained “some very significant concessions” in the LCR’s design, said  Richard Reid , a research fellow for finance and regulation at the  University of Dundee  in  Scotland , said in an e-mail. “No doubt we will see flexibility in the implementation of other regulatory measures as we go through 2013.”  Shares Rise  The Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index rose as much as 2.1 percent. Italy’s  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  was leading gains at 8.5 percent at 4:40 p.m. in Milan trading.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  was up 3 percent and both  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  advanced more than 3 percent.  The longer timetable for applying the LCR should ensure “that the ensuing costs on banks, and therefore their clients’ products” are “introduced more gradually,”  Patricia Jackson , head of prudential advisory at Ernst & Young LLP in  London , said in an e-mailed statement.  The decision to relax liquidity rules for banks may boost pre-tax profit at Barclays by around 4 percent, according to Andrew Lim, an analyst at  Banco Espirito Santo SA. (BES)   U.K. banks such as Barclays, which have built up large reserves of high-quality liquid assets, will be among the biggest beneficiaries of global regulators’ decision to implement a watered-down version of the LCR, Lim said in a note to clients.  Credit Squeeze  Regulators at the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  struggled throughout 2012 to revise the LCR. After failing to reach a final deal last month, it was left to central bank and regulatory chiefs to make a final decision.  “This was a compromise between competing views from around the world,”  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said at a briefing following yesterday’s meeting. King chairs the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, or GHOS, which decides on global bank rules. “For the first time in regulatory history we have a truly global minimum standard for bank liquidity.”  “The new liquidity standard will in no way hinder the ability of the global banking system to finance a global recovery,” King said. “It’s a realistic approach. It certainly did not emanate from an attempt to weaken the standard.”  The LCR would force  banks  to hold enough easy-to-sell assets to survive a 30-day credit squeeze. It’s a key component of a package of capital and liquidity measures, known as Basel III, drawn up to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.  Basel III has been subject to mounting criticism for its complexity, amid delays to its implementation in the European Union and U.S.  The liquidity rule sets out a  stress test  that banks should apply to their books, assessing whether they would be able to generate enough cash from asset sales to meet their regulatory obligations.  Sixty Percent  A draft version of the measure was published by regulators in 2010, on the basis that it would take effect on Jan. 1, 2015.  Under yesterday’s deal, banks would only have to meet 60 percent of the LCR obligations by 2015, and the full rule would be phased in annually through 2019, according to an e-mailed statement from the GHOS.  A sample of 209 banks assessed by the Basel committee had a collective shortfall of 1.8 trillion euros ($2.4 trillion) at the end of 2011 in the assets needed to meet the 2010 version of the LCR, according to figures  published by  the Basel group.  Banks had warned that the initial LCR proposal would force them to buy additional sovereign debt, more closely tying their fate to governments’ solvency. The 2010 rule was drafted before the EU was fully confronted by a sovereign debt crisis that challenged traditional assumptions about the creditworthiness of  government bonds .  Eurozone Commitments  “GHOS has rescued the concept of a global liquidity rule, but its reality remains up in the air,” Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Washington-based Federal Financial Analytics Inc., said in an e-mail. “Commitments were made by eurozone nations to comply with this agreement, but turning word into deed isn’t going to be easy.”  The latest LCR rule retains the principle that banks may use sovereign debt to meet all of their LCR obligations, if the bonds are considered essentially risk free under international bank capital rules. The EU and U.S. have been  criticized  by international regulators for misapplying parts of the capital rules, allowing lenders to count more of the sovereign debt they hold as risk free.  Under the 2010 plan, banks would have been allowed to use cash and government bonds to meet the LCR, subject to some rules on the quality of the sovereign debt. Lenders could also have used highly-rated corporate debt or covered bonds to meet 40 percent of their LCR requirements.  Corporate Debt  The deal expands the range of corporate debt that banks can use, allowing securities with a credit rating of as low as BBB- to be eligible. The 2010 version of the rule stipulated that such debt must have a rating of at least AA-. Banks would also be allowed to use highly rated residential mortgage-backed securities and some equities.  The changes are “a very important and welcome development,” Jackson said. “The previous design of the rules threatened to limit banks capacity to lend because of the very large liquidity buffers which banks would have had to hold.”  The additional securities will get bigger  writedowns  to their value than those that would have been eligible under the 2010 LCR, the GHOS said. They also won’t be allowed to count for more than 15 percent of a bank’s LCR buffer.  Support Measures  Supervisors will have discretion to decide whether the reserves lenders keep with central banks will count toward the LCR. Regulators will also continue to assess how the LCR will interact with liquidity support measures provided by national central banks, the GHOS said.  “It became clear during the process of discussing all this that it didn’t make sense really to think about an LCR without having a clear view about what to make of access to central bank facilities,” King said.  “The committee and the regulatory community more generally felt it was appropriate to broaden the class of liquid assets,” King said. “That doesn’t mean to say it’s a loosening of the whole regime.”  Authorities also agreed to water down parts of the stress scenario that banks will be pitted against to calculate whether they hold enough LCR assets. Still, they expanded the range of risks on derivatives trades that will be taken into account.  Covered Bonds  Central banks and regulators left the treatment of covered bonds in the LCR unchanged from 2010. Covered bonds are secured by assets such as mortgages or public-sector loans and are guaranteed by the issuer.  Regulatory chiefs said they will give additional guidance on when banks will be allowed to use their LCR buffers.  The GHOS brings together top officials from central banks and regulators in 27 nations including the U.S., U.K.,  China  and  Japan . It is the governing body of the Basel committee.  The Basel committee will also press ahead with reviewing another draft liquidity rule included in Basel III. This measure, known as a net-stable funding ratio, requires banks to back long-term lending with funding that won’t dry up in a crisis.  Yesterday’s deal was “significant progress which addresses issues already raised by the European Commission,”  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services chief, said in an e- mailed statement. The European Banking Authority will carry out further assessments of the LCR before beginning to phase-in the rule in 2015, he said. “The treatment of liquidity is fundamental, both for the stability of banks as well as for their role in supporting wider economic recovery,” Barnier said.
