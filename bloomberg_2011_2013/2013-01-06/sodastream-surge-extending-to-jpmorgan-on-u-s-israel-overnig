SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , the
Israeli maker of soda machines trading at the most expensive
level since February, will extend last year’s 37 percent climb
as its U.S. business grows, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   Shares of the company, based in Airport City,  Israel ,
climbed 12 percent last week in New York to $48.69, the highest
level since Aug. 15, 2011. It was the biggest gainer on the
 Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest U.S.-traded
Israeli companies, which rallied 1.6 percent in its first weekly
advance since November.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  rose 3.2
percent Jan. 4, trimming its slide in the week to 13 percent.  SodaStream, which sells its machines, gas canisters and
flavors in  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , trades at 18.3 times estimated
earnings, the highest level since Feb. 29. The U.S. will
contribute 39 percent of SodaStream’s sales this year, according
to JPMorgan, from 29 percent in 2011. The company will post a 44
percent jump in adjusted net income in the first quarter, the
median of analysts’ estimates shows.  “As the top line continues to grow, and more U.S. revenue
switches to canisters and flavors, the profitability in the U.S.
business will improve,” John Faucher, an analyst at JPMorgan
who rates SodaStream a buy, said by phone in New York Jan. 4.
“That’s a trend that benefits SodaStream.”  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index ended last week at
86.78. Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  rose 0.7 percent to 1,218.84 at
10:57 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  Rising Income  SodaStream, which is counting on a commercial during next
month’s Super Bowl to boost U.S. sales, will  post  net income in
the first quarter of $14.6 million, according to the average of
four analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the
first quarter will rise 23 percent, according to the average of
five forecasts.  The stock is trading at its widest premium versus the
average valuation for companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index
since at least February, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  SodaStream began to roll out its products in May at 2,900
stores owned by Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, while
its machines have also been available since at least the second
quarter at Target Corp., Staples Inc. and Bed Bath & Beyond
Inc., as well as department stores owned by  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  and
Macy’s Inc.  As the shares have soared, bets on its decline have
decreased.  SodaStream’s 9.6 percent rally in the second half of 2012
came as  short interest  on the stock declined to 8.1 million
shares, or 45 percent of the company’s float, at the end of
December from 10.8 million shares in May, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Fad Concerns  Investors have been shorting SodaStream on concern the
product, which carbonates tap water, is a fad and that revenue
growth will slow as copycat machines and products encroach on
market share, Faucher said.  Mellanox plunged last week in the U.S. to $52.31, after the
Yokneam Elit, Israel-based developer of data management
technology cut its fourth-quarter sales forecast to between $119
million and $121 million, compared with revenue guidance given
in October of $145 million to $150 million.  Shares of the company rose Jan. 4 after Chief Executive
Officer Eyal Waldman said in an interview after markets closed
the day before that he expects $150 million in quarterly sales
to again become the “base line sometime in 2013.”  Mellanox’s revenue in the third quarter  reached  a record
$156.5 million. The shares in Tel Aviv rose 3.7 percent to
197.4, or the equivalent of $52.32, this morning.  Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , which develops products to track
wireless traffic, tumbled 16 percent last week to $14.63 in New
York after Oppenheimer & Co. said fourth-quarter sales will miss
analysts’ estimates. Shares of Hod Hasharon, Israel-based Allot
traded in Tel Aviv lost 8.7 percent this morning to 55.69
shekels, or the equivalent of $14.76, heading for the lowest
close since November 2011.  Ittai Kidron, a New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer,
wrote in a Jan. 3 report that Allot will report fourth-quarter
sales of $28.6 million and net income of $5 million, missing the
 mean  for revenue of $31.09 million and profit of $5.5 million of
11 analysts’ estimates collated by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
