Barclays Plc (BARC)  will reduce its IT
spending by billions of pounds after developing its own cloud-
based technology, the Sunday Times reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The bank, which is also beginning to use Linux’s operating
system, could reduce its IT costs by 90 percent, the London-
based newspaper said without attribution.  Shaygan Kheradpir, the chief operating officer for retail
and business banks, is introducing the new system across the
bank’s other divisions, the paper reported without citation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
