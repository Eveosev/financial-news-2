The  Green Bay Packers  beat the
Minnesota Vikings 24-10, and the Houston Texans defeated the
Cincinnati Bengals 19-13 to advance to the second round of the
National Football League playoffs.  The fourth-seeded Baltimore Ravens meet the No. 5 seed
Indianapolis Colts today in the second American Football
Conference first-round game. In the  National Football
Conference , it’s fifth-seeded Seattle against No. 4 seed
Washington.  The Packers reached the NFC’s second round against the  San
Francisco 49ers  on Jan. 12. The Texans moved to the next level
against the  New England Patriots  on Jan. 13.  “The defense played at a championship level,” said
Packers quarterback  Aaron Rodgers  in a televised interview at
Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. “It will be a tough test
next week in  San Francisco .”  Dujuan Harris and John Kuhn ran for touchdowns in the first
half, and Mason Crosby had a 20-yard field goal to give the
third-seeded Packers a 17-3 lead over the Vikings (10-6), whose
quarterback Christian Ponder was sidelined with an elbow injury.  Kuhn caught a nine-yard scoring pass from Rodgers in the
third quarter as the Packers (11-5) went ahead 24-3. Rodgers
connected with an NFL playoff-record 10 receivers as he threw
for 274 yards.  Packer Defense Strong  The Packers defense held  Adrian Peterson  to 99 yards
rushing and sacked quarterback Joe Webb three times.  “The main thing was to just get out and get a big win
here,” said Charles Woodson, who was playing his first game
since he broke his collarbone against  St. Louis  on Oct. 21. “I
felt good. I thought I moved around well.”  Blair Walsh kicked a 33-yard field goal for the sixth-
seeded Vikings in the first quarter, and Webb threw a 50-yard
scoring pass to Michael Jenkins in the fourth quarter.  Webb connected on 11 of 30 passing attempts for 180 yards,
one touchdown and one interception.  At Reliant Stadium in Houston,  Arian Foster  scored one
touchdown and ran 140 yards to lead the Texans to their win.
Foster, who became the first NFL player to gain 100 rushing
yards in each of his first three playoff games, dashed one yard
in the third quarter to give the Texans a 16-7 lead.  “We like to run the ball, we played good defense,” Foster
said in a televised interview.  The Texans tallied 158 rushing yards to 80 yards for the
Bengals. Houston accumulated 419 total yards compared with 207
yards for Cincinnati.  Shayne Graham kicked field goals of 48, 27 and 22 yards in
the first half to give the Texans a 9-7 advantage, and added a
24-yard score in the fourth quarter.  Houston quarterback Matt Schaub completed 29 of 38 passing
attempts for 261 yards and one interception.  “It’s a great feeling to come away with a win,” he said.  The Bengals’ Leon Hall returned a 21-yard interception for
a touchdown in the second quarter, while Josh Brown kicked
field goals of 34 and 47 yards in the second half for the
Bengals (10-7).  Andy Dalton  passed for 147 yards and one interception.  To contact the reporter on this story:
