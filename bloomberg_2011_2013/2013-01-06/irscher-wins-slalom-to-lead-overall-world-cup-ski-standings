Austria’s Marcel Hirscher won today’s
slalom in Zagreb,  Croatia , to move atop the overall standings in
skiing’s World Cup.  The 23-year-old had a combined time of  1 minute, 56.17 
seconds over two legs, 0.57 second faster than Sweden’s Andre
Myhrer. Austria’s Mario Matt was third.  Hirscher, who won the overall and giant slalom competitions
last season, now leads the combined standings this season with
740 points, with Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal on 689. Svindal did
not compete today.  Hirscher also tops the slalom competition after his eighth
World Cup career victory in the discipline. His other seven wins
have all been in giant slalom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
