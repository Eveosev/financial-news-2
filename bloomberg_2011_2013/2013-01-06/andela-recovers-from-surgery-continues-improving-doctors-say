Nelson Mandela , the former South
African president who was hospitalized for two weeks last month,
has recovered from surgery and a lung infection and continues to
improve, the government said today.  After last month’s operation to remove gallstones, Mandela,
94, continues receiving care at his home in Johannesburg and is
gradually re-establishing his daily routine, South Africa’s
president’s office said in an e-mailed statement today. The
Nobel Peace Prize winner has made steady progress, his doctors
said, according to the statement.  Mandela, who became the country’s first black president
after the all-race elections that ended apartheid in 1994, was
admitted to a hospital on Dec. 8 to receive treatment for a
recurring lung infection and discharged Dec. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
