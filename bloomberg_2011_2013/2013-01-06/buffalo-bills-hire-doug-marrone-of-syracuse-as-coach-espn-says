The Buffalo Bills have reached an
agreement with Doug Marrone of Syracuse University to become the
next coach of the National Football League team, ESPN reported,
citing league sources it didn’t identify.  Marrone, who has yet to sign a contract, succeeds Chan
Gailey, who was fired Dec. 31 after going 16-32 over three
seasons. The Bills haven’t had a winning record since 2004 and
have missed the playoffs for 13 straight seasons, the longest
active streak in the NFL.  The 48-year-old Marrone went 25-25 in four seasons at
Syracuse, which had gone 26-57 over the previous seven years,
ESPN said. It was his first head-coaching job. Marrone was
offensive line coach for the  New York  Jets from 2002-05 and
offensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints from 2006-08.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
