Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  criticized efforts by political party leaders opposed
to his policies on the  peace process  to unite or agree on a
joint strategy ahead of Jan. 22 national elections.  “There’s no doubt that the left-wing parties will try to
unite either before or right after the election, and they will
have one goal, to bring down my government,” Netanyahu said in
an interview on  Israel  Radio today.  Netanyahu’s Likud-Beitenu parliamentary election slate,
which joins his party to the faction of former foreign minister
Avigdor Liberman, maintained its lead in a poll published Friday
in the Jerusalem Post that showed it winning 32 seats in
Israel’s 120-seat Knesset. Netanyahu would win re-election with
the support of other parties that have said they would back him
for prime minister, according to the survey.  Labor’s Shelly Yachimovich, Hatenuah’s  Tzipi Livni , and
Yesh Atid’s Yair Lapid have criticized Netanyahu’s handling of
efforts to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians. All three
said in interviews they would meet to discuss ways of uniting to
either block his return to the premiership or to join the next
government as a united group in order to influence its policies.
The three parties would together gain 37 seats according to the
Jerusalem Post poll, well short of the 60 they would need to
block Netanyahu from forming a coalition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
