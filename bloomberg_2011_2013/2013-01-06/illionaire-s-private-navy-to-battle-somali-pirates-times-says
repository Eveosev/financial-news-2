A private navy founded by companies
led by  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  will protect its first convoy
of oil tankers and bulk carriers from Somali pirates in the
Indian Ocean in late March or April, the Sunday Times reported,
citing an interview with Glencore Chairman  Simon Murray .  Typhon, a venture formed by a group of U.K. businessmen led
by Murray, will recruit 240 former marines and sailors for its
navy, the London-based newspaper reported.  The force was set up because the U.K.’s Royal Navy, NATO
and the European Union Naval Force don’t have enough vessels to
patrol the area, the Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
