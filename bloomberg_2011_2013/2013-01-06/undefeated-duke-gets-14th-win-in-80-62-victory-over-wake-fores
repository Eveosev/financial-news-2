Ryan Kelly and Seth Curry each scored
22 points to help top-ranked  Duke University  extend its winning
streak to 14 games with an 80-62 college basketball victory over
 Wake Forest University .  In another game involving a school in the top five
rankings, No. 3 Arizona topped Utah 60-57.  At Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham,  North Carolina , Mason
Plumlee had 13 points and 12 rebounds and Rasheed Sulaimon added
12 points for the Blue Devils (14-0, 1-0 ACC), who snapped Wake
Forest’s three-game winning streak.  Kelly, who fouled out with just over seven minutes left in
the game, finished one point shy of his career-high that he
tallied during the Blue Devils last encounter with the Demon
Deasons 11 months ago.  “He stepped up and he just had the openings and knocked
them down,” said Duke coach  Mike Krzyzewski . “He was on his
way to a 35-point or 40-point game, really, because we would
have kept calling his number.”  Travis McKie led Wake Forest (7-6, 0-1 ACC) with 22 points
and 11 rebounds.  The Demon Deacons had 19 turnovers, just four fewer than
their 23 field goals.  “Our young team played hard,” Wake Forest coach Jeff
Bzdelik said. “We need to play better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
