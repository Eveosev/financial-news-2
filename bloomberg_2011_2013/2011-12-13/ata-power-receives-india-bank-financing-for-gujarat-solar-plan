Tata Power Co., one of  India ’s
biggest non-state generators, will order equipment for a 3.65
billion-rupee ($68 million) solar project from panel suppliers
including Suntech Power Holdings Co.  Suntech, the world’s biggest panel maker, Canadian Solar
Inc. and Tata BP Solar Ltd. will supply the 25-megawatt plant in
western Gujarat state with crystalline silicon-based modules,
the Mumbai-based utility said in an e-mail today.  The project in Mithapur has received financing from local
banks led by  State Bank  of India and Export-Import Bank of
India. The banks will fund 70 percent of the project with rupee
term loans, Tata Power said.  The company declined when asked to provide further details
on the loans and interest rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
