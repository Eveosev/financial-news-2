France ’s port of Rouen,  Europe ’s
largest grain-export hub, will dredge the shipping channel in
the Seine River over the next four years to allow the inland
port to accommodate vessels as big as 58,000 metric tons.  Regional authorities approved the works after negotiations
that started in 2007, Francois Henriot, a port spokesman, said
by phone today. The first phase will involve deepening the
river from its mouth on the  English Channel  to an  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  refinery about 25 kilometers (16 miles) upriver.  The dredging works will increase the channel’s navigable
depth by 1 meter to 11.7 meters (38.4 feet), allowing access
of handymax and supramax sized vessels, according to Henriot.
The budget is 185 million euros ($242 million), he said.  Dredging the shipping channel may allow Rouen to attract
almost 10 million tons of cargo a year, according to an e-
mailed statement from the port. It expects its second-best year
in 2011, after a record in 2010, with more than 24 million tons
of cargo handled as of Dec. 7, Henriot said.  Shipping Channel  The port, France’s fifth-biggest, now mostly receives
vessels of 25,000 to 30,000 tons. Enlarging the shipping channel
will benefit transport of oil products as well as agricultural
commodities, according to the spokesman. Societe de Dragage
Internationale and Entreprises Morillon Corvol Courbot won a
tender for the first phase of the project, using a dredging
vessel from  Belgium ’s Dredging Environmental & Marine
Engineering NV.  Draft constraints typically limit grain cargoes loaded in
Rouen to about 40,000 tons. The port lost business in the first
half of 2010 when  Egypt , the world’s biggest wheat buyer,
demanded cargoes between 55,000 and 60,000 tons be loaded at a
single port, before dropping the demand in July that year.  The port will issue several tenders for further stages of
the dredging project, deepening the river from the mouth to
Rouen, 120 kilometers upstream, according to Henriot. The works
will last from 2012 to 2015, he said.  Rouen this year handled 11.5 million tons of liquid bulk,
10.5 million tons of solid bulk and 2 million tons of other
cargoes, including containers, according to Henriot. Grain
transshipment as of Dec. 7 was 7.2 million tons of cereals,
compared with 9 million tons in 2010.  Exxon Mobile operates a refinery at Port-Jerome, near the
town of Notre-Dame-de-Gravenchon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
