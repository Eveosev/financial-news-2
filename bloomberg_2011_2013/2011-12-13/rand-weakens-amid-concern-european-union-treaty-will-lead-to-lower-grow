The rand strengthened as German
investor confidence unexpectedly increased and  Spain  sold more
debt than planned at an auction, boosting equity markets and
commodities.  South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 0.5 percent
to 8.2235 per dollar, reversing an earlier decline of 0.4
percent. It traded at 8.2366 as of 4:36 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim,
 Germany , said its index of  investor and analyst expectations 
increased to minus 53.8 in December from a three-year low of
minus 55.2 the previous month. Economists forecast a drop to
minus 55.8. Spain sold 4.94 billion euros ($6.5 billion) of
bills, more than the maximum target of 4.25 billion euros.
Countries in the European Union consume about a third of South
African manufactured goods.  “There’s been some recovery in stock markets, if you look
at the DAX and the FTSE,” Ion de Vleeschauwer, chief dealer at
Bidvest Bank Ltd. in Johannesburg, which runs South Africa’s
largest chain of moneychangers, said by phone. “Although not
massive gains, we did see a bit of improvement in sentiment.
It’s a bit of a relief rally really.”  Germany’s  DAX Index (DAX)  rose 0.6 percent, while the  FTSE 100 (UKX) 
Index in  London  climbed 1 percent.  Standard and Poor’s GSCI 
Index of commodities gained 0.6 percent. Commodities make up
more than half of South Africa’s total exports, according to
Rand Merchant Bank.  South Africa’s 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 declined for a
seventh day, driving the yield up four basis points, or 0.043
percentage points, to 6.898 percent, the highest on a closing
basis since Nov. 29. The yield climbed seven basis points
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
