Opap SA (OPAP) , Italyâ€™s  Lottomatica SpA (LTO) ,
 Scientific Games Corp.  of the U.S. and  Intralot SA (INLOT)  will submit a
joint bid today to run and operate Hellenic Lotteries,
 Kathimerini  newspaper said.  The joint venture was formed as access to loans was
difficult under current market conditions and the four will
participate with about an equal share, the Athens-based
newspaper said, without citing anyone. The bid is expected to be
the only one in the first round of the tender for the 12-year
license, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
