Manchester United midfielderDarren Fletcher will take an “extended break” from the English soccer
team because of his health.  Fletcher, who also plays for  Scotland , has missed several
periods during the last year, and today said he’s suffering from
ulcerative colitis, a chronic bowel condition, the team said on
its website.  “He was able to maintain remission of symptoms for a
considerable period,” the club said in the statement. “This
has proved more difficult recently, and Darren’s continued
desire to play and his loyalty to both his club and country has
probably compromised the chances of optimising his own health
and fitness.”  He’ll take a full break after doctors told him it was the
best way of achieving remission from the illness, United said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
