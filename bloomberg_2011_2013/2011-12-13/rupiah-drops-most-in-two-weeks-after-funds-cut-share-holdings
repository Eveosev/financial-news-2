Indonesia ’s rupiah fell the most in
two weeks after international investors cut holdings of the
nation’s assets on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will hurt Asian
exports.  Global funds sold $21 million more local stocks than they
bought yesterday, exchange data show. The currency traded near a
one-week low and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of  shares (MXAP)  declined
after Moody’s Investors Service said last week’s European summit
didn’t reduce the prospect of rating downgrades for the region’s
nations. Ten-year  government bonds  advanced.  “The market is likely to be affected more by sour global
sentiment surrounding Europe’s crisis,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a Singapore-based currency strategist at Malayan
Banking Bhd.  The rupiah dropped 0.6 percent, the most since Nov. 28, to
9,105 per dollar as of 3:40 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached
9,130 earlier, the weakest level since Dec. 7.  A fiscal accord by European Union leaders that added 200
billion euros ($264 billion) to their bailout fund doesn’t
diminish the risk of downgrades, Moody’s Investors Service said
yesterday.  Bank Indonesia  expects the currency to trade between 8,900
and 9,000 next year, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono told
reporters in Jakarta yesterday. The monetary authority plans to
boost “intervention” to support the rupiah, Governor Darmin
Nasution said on Nov. 30 after it touched a 17-month low of
9,240 a day earlier.  “There is still the risk of central bank intervention,”
Tanuwidjaja said. “They will do it if the rupiah gets out of
whack with regional currencies.”  The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 dropped
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.17 percent,
according to Inter Dealer Market Association. It fell to 6.15
percent earlier, the lowest level since October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
