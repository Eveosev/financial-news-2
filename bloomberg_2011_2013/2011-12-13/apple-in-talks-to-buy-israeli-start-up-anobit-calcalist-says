Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is in advanced talks to
buy Israeli semiconductor designer Anobit Technologies Ltd. for
$400 million to $500 million, Calcalist reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Following a deal, Anobit may become Apple’s research and
development center in Israel, the newspaper said.  Anobit, founded in 2006, is a maker of flash-memory
products used in smartphones and tablet computers. Apple is
already using some of the company’s offerings in its iPhone and
iPad, Calcalist said. Anobit would be Apple’s first acquisition
in Israel, the newspaper said.  Apple spokesman Alan Hely said the company doesn’t comment
on speculation. An e-mail message and a fax sent to the Anobit’s
headquarters in Herzliya,  Israel  went unanswered.  Anobit in August said it shipped more than 20 million of
its embedded flash controllers so far this year. The company’s
memory signal processing technology uses proprietary signal
processing algorithms to improve the performance of flash memory
chips.  According to Anobit’s  website , the company raised $76
million from investors including venture capital firms  Battery
Ventures  and Pitango Venture Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
