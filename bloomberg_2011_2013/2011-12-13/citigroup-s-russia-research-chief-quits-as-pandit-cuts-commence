Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s  Russia  research
chief Mikhail Seleznev said he quit as the U.S. bank begins to
cut 4,500 jobs worldwide to control costs.  “I’ve decided to leave the company,” Seleznev said by
phone in Moscow today, declining to give a reason. His departure
follows that of colleagues including sales trader John Heisel.  “As part of our ongoing efforts to control expenses, we
are making targeted headcount reductions in certain businesses
and functions across Citi,” said Denis Denisov, a Moscow-based
spokesman for the bank, by e-mail. “Russia is a priority market
for Citi and we continue to invest in our businesses and hire
new talents.”  Seleznev rejoined Citigroup in 2009 after leaving in 2008
to join Deutsche Bank AG in Moscow as co-head of research.  Other departures include equity traders Alexander Zorov and
Sergey Akimov, according to Citigroup director Pavel Zinoviev,
who answered Zorov’s phone today.  Citigroup Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  said Dec. 6
that he aims to cut 4,500 jobs as part of a bid to trim costs
amid slumping revenue and what he called “unprecedented”
market conditions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
