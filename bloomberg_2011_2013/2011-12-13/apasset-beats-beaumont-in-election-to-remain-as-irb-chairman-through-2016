Bernard Lapasset was elected to a
second straight term as chairman of the International Rugby
Board after defeating vice chairman Bill Beaumont in a vote.  Lapasset, a 64-year-old Frenchman, was re-elected as the
governing body’s top administrator through 2016 by 14 votes to
12 at an IRB Council meeting in  Los Angeles , the board said in
an e-mailed statement.  South African Oregan Hoskins will take over as vice
chairman on Jan. 1 after securing Lapasset’s casting vote
following a 13-13 tie with former England captain Beaumont in
two rounds of voting.  The elections were originally due to have taken place in
Auckland ahead of the Oct. 23 Rugby World Cup final, though the
council postponed a decision to keep the focus on rugby’s
showcase match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
