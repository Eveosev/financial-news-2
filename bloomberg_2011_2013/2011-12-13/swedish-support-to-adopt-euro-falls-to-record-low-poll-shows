Swedish support for joining the euro
slumped to a record low since voters turned down the European
single currency in a referendum eight years ago, a poll by the
statistics office showed.  Of those surveyed, 11.2 percent were in favor of joining
the euro while 80.4 percent would vote against joining the
single currency, the poll published by  Statistics Sweden  today
showed. It surveyed 5,907 people between Nov. 1 and Nov. 27.  Sweden is unlikely to seek euro accession for a long time
as voters recoil from the currency bloc’s deepening debt crisis,
Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Dec. 6.  Those opposing the euro have outnumbered those in favor in
all but one of Statistic Sweden’s bi-annual polls since Sweden
turned down the currency in a September 2003 referendum with
54.6 percent voting against and 43.2 percent in favor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
