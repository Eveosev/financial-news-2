All Blacks and Crusaders winger Zac
Guildford was banned from the first match of the 2012 Super
Rugby season as punishment for his drunken behavior in the Cook
Islands last month.  The New Zealand Rugby Union also ordered Guildford, 22, to
seek alcohol treatment and counseling at his own expense after
conducting a misconduct hearing following reports that he
staggered naked, drunk and bleeding into a bar on Nov. 11 and
then assaulted two people. He was also accused of harassing a
Cook Islands triathlete in the South Pacific nation.  Guildford’s conduct was “unprofessional and brought the
game into disrepute,” the Wellington-based NZRU said today in a
 statement . The governing body imposed a four-match ban covering
the Crusaders’ three pre-season matches and the Feb. 24 Super
Rugby opener against the Blues in Auckland.  “Taking players out of rugby is not something we do
lightly,” Neil Sorensen, the NZRU’s general manager of
professional rugby, said in the statement. “But we have taken
into account the fact that with regard to alcohol-related
behavior, Zac does not have an exemplary record.”  Guildford, who said Sept. 19 that he had an alcohol problem
after being reprimanded by the All Blacks management during the
 Rugby World Cup , said that he was embarrassed by his actions.  “I let down the many people who support me,” he said in
the statement. “I am focused on getting myself into the place I
need to be when I return to rugby next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
