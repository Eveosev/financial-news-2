The liquidator of the MF Global Inc.
brokerage said that “certain” actions of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
a lender to the broker-dealer’s parent, “are likely to be the
subject of investigation.”  The trustee, James Giddens, said he would “act with the
respect to” those actions to recover money for brokerage
customers if necessary. He didn’t specify what the actions were
in a court filing yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
