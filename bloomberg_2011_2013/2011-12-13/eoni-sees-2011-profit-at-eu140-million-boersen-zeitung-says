with Chief Executive Officer Klaus Probst.  The company may pay a dividend of 1.40 euros per share and
may issue as much as 300 million euros in new debt in half a
year, while looking at issuing as much as 400 million euros by
2013, the newspaper cited Probst as saying.  The company aims at outgrowing its industry by as much as 6
percentage points next year, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
