BP Plc bought a  jet fuel  cargo at a
lower price than a deal on Nov. 23. Diesel premiums rose. Gasoil
on  London ’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange increased. The heating
fuel’s premium to  Brent crude , or crack, declined. Gasoline
barge prices surged after Brent climbed.  Light Products  Gasoline  barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $907 to as much as $931 a metric
ton, according to a broker monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board.
That compares with yesterday’s deals at $905 to $914.  Gasoline’s  premium to Brent narrowed 8 cents to $1.28 a
barrel, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and
products broker in London.  Naphtha’s  discount to Brent widened to $8.52 a barrel from
$8.17 yesterday, PVM data show.  Naphtha-based petrochemical plants in Europe may be idled
because of rising costs, leaving the region unable to compete
with cheaper ethane-based facilities in  North America  and the
 Middle East , the  International Energy Agency  said in a report.  Middle Distillates  BP purchased the jet fuel from Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s
trading arm at a premium of $62 a ton to January ICE gasoil,
priced for delivery to the French port of  Le Havre , according to
a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. BP secured a cargo
on Nov. 23 at a $71 premium.  Diesel  barges changed hands at premiums of $13 to $16 a ton
to January gasoil, the survey of Platts showed. That compares
with premiums of $12 to $14 yesterday.  Barges of  gasoil  traded at premiums of $2 a ton to January
gasoil, according to the survey. That’s lower than yesterday’s
deals at $4 and $5 more than the futures price.  Gasoil for January rose 0.6 percent to $928.50 a ton as of
4:46 p.m. London time, according to data by the ICE exchange.
Front-month Brent increased 1.8 percent to $109.17 a barrel.  The fuel’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
shrank to $15.88 a barrel from $16.13 at 4:30 p.m. yesterday
according to ICE data.  Refining profits have ended the year at “dismal” levels
and are set to continue in the new year because of slowing
economic growth that’s cutting demand for oil-products such as
diesel, according to JBC Energy GmbH.  To contact the reporter on this story:
