Jeff Bezos , founder and chief
executive officer of  Amazon.com (AMZN)  Inc., and his wife donated $15
million to Princeton University to fund neuroscience research.  The gift will establish the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit
Dynamics, which will investigate how the brain makes decisions
and recalls memories, the university in Princeton, New Jersey,
said today in a  statement . The center will be housed at the
Princeton Neuroscience Institute.  Bezos, 47, is a 1986 alumnus of Princeton, where he studied
electrical engineering and computer science. His wife, MacKenzie Bezos, graduated from the university in 1992. He founded
Seattle-based Amazon.com, the world’s largest online retailer,
in 1994 after working for D.E. Shaw & Co., an  investment
company . Amazon had sales of $34.2 billion and 33,700 employees
in 2010.  “The Princeton Neuroscience Institute is grappling with
some of the most fascinating questions in the scientific world
today and the Bezos Center will significantly advance our
understanding of how the brain works,” Princeton President
Shirley Tilghman said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
