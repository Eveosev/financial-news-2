Pure Diam of Dubai expects to get
 Kimberley Process  approval to export diamonds from Zimbabwe’s
Marange field, said Gilliam Sithole, managing director of the
company’s Zimbabwe unit, Diamond Mining Corp. (Pvt) Ltd.  Pure Diam started mining gems at Marange four months ago in
a joint venture with the state-owned Zimbabwe Mining Development
Corp., Sithole told reporters in Odzi, eastern Zimbabwe, today.  The Kimberley Process, an organization that monitors the
sale of so-called  conflict diamonds , allowed exports from two
operations in the region last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
