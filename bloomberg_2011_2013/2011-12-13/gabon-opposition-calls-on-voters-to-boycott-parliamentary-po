Opposition political parties in
Gabon, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s sixth-biggest oil producer, called
on voters to boycott a parliamentary election planned for Dec.
17, because they said the vote wouldn’t be fair.  The leaders of 12 groups are traveling around the central
African nation this week to appeal to residents not to cast
ballots for the 120-seat National Assembly, Pierre-Andre
Kombila, leader of the Rassemblement National des Bucherons, an
opposition group, said in a radio statement yesterday.  Prime Minister Paul Biyoghe Mba asked voters to ignore the
boycott call in a statement on Radio Television Gabonaise
yesterday.  As many as 475 candidates are vying for the seats,
including 90 from President Ali-Ben Bongo Ondimba’s Parti
Democratique Gabonaise and 160 candidates from smaller groups
that support the leader, according to the country’s
 Constitutional Court .  To contact the reporter on this story:
