Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social,  Brazil ’s development bank, will provide 1.8
billion reais ($966 million) to finance wind farms as the
renewable energy source dominates government auctions for new
power capacity.  ContourGlobal LP, Uniao dos Ventos, DESA Eolicas SA and
Grupo Galvao will use the funds to build 26 wind energy projects
with a total of 628.8 megawatts of capacity, the Rio de Janeiro-
based bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  Wind farms are receiving more contracts to sell power
through government-organized auctions in Brazil than small
hydroelectric and biomass plants, Eduardo Tabbush, an analyst at
Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s London office, said today in a
telephone interview.  “More wind farms are signing contracts in auctions because
they’re cheaper to build,” he said.  The 26 projects will cost 2.6 billion reais and are planned
for the northeastern state of  Rio Grande  do Norte.  BNDES approved 3.3 billion reais worth of loans to
Brazilian wind farms in 2011, almost quadruple last year’s
total, according to the statement.  Brazilian electricity distributors signed contracts to buy
electricity from 78 wind farms at an average rate of about 100
reais a megawatt-hour in the nation’s last two power auctions in
August, national energy agency Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica
said on its  website . None went to small hydroelectric plants and
11 went to biomass projects.  To contact the reporters on this story:
