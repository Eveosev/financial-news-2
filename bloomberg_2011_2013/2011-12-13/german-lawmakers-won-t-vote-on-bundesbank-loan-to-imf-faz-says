Lawmakers from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition refuse to vote on a plan to use central bank
loans to increase the International Monetary Fund’s lending
capacity, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said.  A Bundesbank loan to the IMF as part of an international
effort aimed at stemming the euro-area debt is a matter for the
independent central bank and so doesn’t require parliamentary
approval, the newspaper cited Christian Democrat Norbert Barthle
and Free Democrat Volker Wissing as saying. Parliament’s budget
committee will take note of the plan at a meeting tomorrow
without voting on it, the newspaper said.  European Central Bank Executive Board member  Juergen Stark 
rejects such an increase of the IMF’s lending capacity by mostly
European central banks that flows back to  Europe , saying it’s an
attempt to circumvent the ban on monetary state financing in the
euro area, the newspaper citing him as saying an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
