Finnish lawmakers are approaching
pension funds and other institutional investors to finance
growth companies, according to Mikael Jungner, the leader of a
parliamentary working group on startups.  “We will get together these startup people and
institutions with huge amounts of money to invest, which haven’t
invested in startup funds before,” Jungner, a lawmaker from the
 Social Democratic Party , said in an interview in Helsinki. “We
will arrange a meeting in early spring.”  Finland, one of six AAA rated euro countries, is trying to
incubate fast-growing technology companies to create jobs,
compensating for positions lost in industries like forestry and
mobile phones. The country is looking to entrepreneurs like
Rovio Entertainment Ltd., creators of the Angry Birds game, to
boost exports and put it on a firmer footing to take care of
 Europe ’s fastest-aging population. Rovio is closely held.  The group is also drawing up a proposal for concrete
measures the government can take to encourage startups, which it
will present in January, Jungner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
