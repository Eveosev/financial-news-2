Spanish home sales declined in
October for an eighth month as the economy stalled and
unemployment surged.  The number of  transactions  fell 18 percent from a year
earlier, after declining an annual 28.2 percent in September,
the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Spain  is struggling to work through an excess of 700,000
new homes after the collapse of a building boom saddled banks
with 176 billion euros ($233 billion) of what the Bank of Spain
calls “troubled” assets linked to real estate. Tax rebates for
buyers have failed to spur the market, as a 23 percent
 unemployment  rate deters consumers from making home purchases.  Spain’s economy stalled in the third quarter, and the Bank
of Spain said on Nov. 30 that the economy weakened further in
the last months of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
