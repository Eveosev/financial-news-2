Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ,
whose bestseller is a multiple sclerosis treatment, rose to the
highest level in more than a month as the safety of a rival drug
by Novartis AG came under scrutiny after a patient died.  The shares in the Petach-Tikva, Israel-based company whose
bestselling drug is Copaxone, an injectable treatment for
multiple sclerosis, gained 2.3 percent to 154.50 shekels, the
highest level since Nov. 8, at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .  “Any alternative to Copaxone which encounters safety
issues is good news for Teva as it underlines Copaxone’s very
clean safety profile,” said Jonathan Kreizman, an analyst at
Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  A patient died on Nov. 23 after starting treatment with
Novartis AG’s Gilenya, the Basel, Switzerland-based drugmaker
company said yesterday. The death is the first reported within
24 hours of the initial dose in more than 28,000 patients who
have taken the drug, and a role for Gilenya in the death can’t
be excluded or confirmed, spokesman  Eric Althoff  said yesterday
in a statement.  Teva shares have dropped 17 percent this year in Tel Aviv
as competition grows for Copaxone and after it introduced fewer
generic drugs in the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
