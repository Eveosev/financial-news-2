Greece  made new proposals on the
structure of a debt swap agreement with private creditors, while
disagreement remains on key issues, according to a person on the
lenders’ negotiating committee.  Under one proposal, Greece would give 15 cents in cash and
35 cents in new bonds for every euro of existing debt that will
be swapped, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the discussions are private.  Greece also agreed in principle to try to give private
creditors seniority equal to official lenders such as the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union, though it’s
not clear whether that would be legally permissible, the person
said. Agreement hasn’t been reached on the maturity of the new
bonds or their coupon, which are crucial to determining the net
present value loss the debt holders will face, the person said.  Greece’s debt is forecast to balloon to almost double the
size of its economy next year without an accord with private
investors, the European Commission said last month. The swap
deal, part of a 130 billion-euro ($170 billion) second bailout
agreement for Greece, is supposed to help the nation reduce its
debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020.  The country’s 206 billion euros of privately held debt
would be reduced by 50 percent under an agreement announced at
an Oct. 26 summit of European leaders in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
