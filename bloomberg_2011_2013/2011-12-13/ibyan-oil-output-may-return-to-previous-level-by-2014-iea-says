Libya’s  crude production will return
to pre-conflict levels of 1.6 million barrels a day by 2014,
 International Energy Agency  said.  “The recovery in Libyan output has exceeded expectations
so far in 2011,” the Paris-based adviser said today in its
monthly oil market report. Libyan output dropped to 45,000
barrels a day in August, according to Bloomberg estimates.  Libya , holder of Africa’s biggest oil reserves, will
increase daily output to 1.6 million barrels by the end of 2012,
Nuri Berruien, chairman of state-run National Oil Corp., said
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
