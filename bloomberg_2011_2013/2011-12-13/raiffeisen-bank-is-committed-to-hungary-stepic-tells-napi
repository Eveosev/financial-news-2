Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  is
committed to staying in  Hungary  even as its activities there
“cause a lot of discomfiture and cost a lot of money,” Chief
Executive Officer Herbert Stepic told  Napi Gazdasag  in an
interview.  “The protracted slowdown of the  economy , the excessive
bank tax, the mortgage repayment plan that goes against European
Union practices and norms, and the extra burden placed on banks,
have a very negative impact on the Hungarian environment,”
Stepic said in the interview, published today.  Hungarian lawmakers passed legislation in September
allowing repayment of mortgages denominated in euros and
Swiss francs at almost 30 percent below market rates, forcing
lenders to take losses.  Banks will continue to contest the repayment plan and
demand compensation for losses incurred at both national and
international level, Napi cited Stepic as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
