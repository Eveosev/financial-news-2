Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) 
reduced its estimate of oil products spilled from a pipeline
near Nemaha City, Nebraska, to 2,834 barrels from 6,000.  The volume of diesel and jet fuel of 1,305 barrels and
1,529 barrels of gasoline spilled Dec. 10, after heavy equipment
struck the pipeline, was determined by metering and pressure
loss data, Bruce Heine, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  “This incident could have been prevented if the bulldozer
operator would have simply called the Nebraska One-Call Center
at 811 before excavating in the area near our pipelines,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
