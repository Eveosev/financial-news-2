Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) , the pharmacy-
benefits manager planning to merge with  Medco Health Solutions
Inc. (MHS) , is in a “contractual dispute” with  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  that
may lead to litigation, the companies said.  The dispute involves the interpretation of certain terms of
Express Scripts’s 2009 purchase of WellPoint’s NextRx pharmacy-
benefits division, St. Louis-based Express Scripts said today in
a regulatory filing and WellPoint said in an e-mail.  WellPoint, based in Indianapolis, raised the dispute and
the possibility of a lawsuit, Express Scripts said. Both
companies said they are seeking to resolve the matter through
discussions though litigation remains possible. Express Scripts
acquired WellPoint’s NextRx unit, with 25 million members, on
Dec. 1, 2009, for $4.7 billion.  Express Scripts  declined 2.9 percent to $43.10 at 5:25 p.m.
New York time in extended trading after closing at $44.40.
WellPoint was unchanged in extended trading after dropping 1.2
percent to close at $64.64.  “The dispute relates to the interpretation of certain
financial contractual terms in the PBM agreement and certain
operational matters associated with Express Scripts’s
performance,” Kristin Binns, a WellPoint spokeswoman, said in
the e-mail.  Express Scripts agreed in July to buy rival Medco to create
the biggest pharmacy benefits manager in the U.S. The deal
requires clearance from the Federal Trade Commission. Pharmacy
benefits managers act as middlemen among drugmakers, pharmacies
and health-plan sponsors to negotiate prices and manage the use
of drugs by patients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
