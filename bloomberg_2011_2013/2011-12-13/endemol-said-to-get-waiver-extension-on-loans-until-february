Endemol NV , the Dutch producer of
the “Big Brother” TV shows, won approval from lenders to waive
its loan terms until February, two people with knowledge of the
discussions said.  The agreement gives Amsterdam-based Endemol more time to
restructure 2.8 billion euros ($3.6 billion) of debt, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
confidential. The waiver has been extended three times since
September.  The company declined to comment on the waiver, reported
earlier by Reuters.  Endemol this week received a $1.3 billion all-cash offer
from  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  It was taken over in 2007 by Mediaset
Espana Comunicacion SA, Cyrte Fund II BV,  Mediaset SpA (MS)  and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
