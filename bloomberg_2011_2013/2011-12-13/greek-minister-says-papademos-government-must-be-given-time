Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
must be able to reshuffle his Cabinet and be given time to
implement budget cuts to avert an economic collapse, Education
Minister Anna Diamantopoulou said.  “The prime minister must have the option of a reshuffle,
to form a government without the imprint of political party
agendas and with wider support,” Diamantopoulou said in a
 letter posted  on her website. “The most capable and suitable
people should participate.”  Papademos, appointed on Nov. 11 as head of an interim
government backed by three of the five Greek parliamentary
parties, is racing against a three-month deadline to secure a
130 billion-euro ($171.5 billion) bailout for  Greece  agreed by
European Union leaders on Oct. 26.  “This government must be given the time it needs to
implement critical decisions and achieve immediate targets,”
Diamantopoulou said. The interim body can’t just be seen as
charged with the task of securing one or two loan tranches, she
said.  Diamantopoulou, who kept her post at the ministry when the
interim government was formed, said every ministry and area
faces “massive” problems that need to be dealt with
immediately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
