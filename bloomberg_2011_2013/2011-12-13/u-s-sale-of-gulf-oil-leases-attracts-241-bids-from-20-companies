The first lease sale for oil
production in the  Gulf of Mexico  since  BP Plc’s  2010 spill
attracted 241 bids from 20 companies, the Interior Department
said as an environmental group sought to block the auction.  Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  will open sealed bids for
tracts off the Texas coast in  New Orleans  tomorrow at 9 a.m.
local time, according to a statement today from the agency. The
total exceeds by 52 the number of bids in the previous western
Gulf sale in August 2009, the department said.  The administration canceled one sale and postponed another
after the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig leased
by BP in April 2010, which killed 11 people and triggered the
largest U.S. offshore spill. Environmental groups filed suit in
 Washington  today to block tomorrow’s sale, saying regulators had
yet to adequately consider production risks.  “The federal government is failing to learn from one of
the most environmentally and economically destructive incidents
in U.S. history,” said David Pettit, senior attorney with
 Natural Resources Defense Council , in an e-mailed statement.  Salazar said in a Nov. 10 statement that new regulations
adopted after the spill have strengthened oversight “at every
stage” of the development process.  Blocks up for sale are located in federal waters from 9
miles (15 kilometers) to more than 250 miles offshore, in water
depths of about 16 feet (5 meters) to more than 10,975 feet,
according to the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , a division
of the Interior Department.  The agency estimates that this sale could result in
production of approximately 222 million to 423 million barrels
of oil and 1.49 trillion to 2.65 trillion cubic feet of natural
gas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
