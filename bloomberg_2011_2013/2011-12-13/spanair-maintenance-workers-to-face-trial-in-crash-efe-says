A Spanish judge decided to send two
plane-maintenance workers to trial over the 2008 crash of a
Madrid-to-Canary Islands Spanair SA flight that killed 154
people and injured 18, Efe reported, citing a court ruling.  The men, who are charged with negligent homicide and
negligent injury, should have done further studies on the
airplane’s faulty equipment and not have cleared it for takeoff,
Judge Juan Javier Perez said yesterday, the newswire said,
citing the concluding report of the Madrid court’s investigation
into the crash.  Perez dismissed charges against a maintenance supervisor
and Spanair’s divisional chiefs for maintenance and quality, Efe
said. The judge allowed civil complaints to remain in effect
against the Barcelona-based airline and insurer Mapfre SA, the
newswire said.  Spanair declined to comment immediately on the report.
Phone calls to Mapfre’s press department weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
