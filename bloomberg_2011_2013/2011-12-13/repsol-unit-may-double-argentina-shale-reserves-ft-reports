Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s Argentina unit said
a three-well drilling program may double its unconventional oil
and gas reserves in the country, the Financial Times reported,
citing Tomas Garcia Blanco, the executive director for upstream.  The wells are being drilled in a 500 square-kilometer (193
square miles) area north of YPF’s Vaca Muerta shale discovery,
which the company says holds recoverable resources of 927
million barrels of oil equivalent. Two of the three new wells
are producing and indicate the new find may hold the same size
reserves as Vaca Muerta, Blanco told the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
