Chinese soybean imports may surge 10
percent in the marketing year that started on Oct. 1, increasing
the country’s share of world purchases to 60 percent, Hamburg-
based researcher Oil World said.  China ’s inbound soybean shipments will total 57.8 million
metric tons this year, Oil World said today in a report. Global
imports will total 95.9 million tons, according to the report.
Brazilian shipments to China surged to 1 million tons in
November from 10,000 tons in the same month a year earlier and
Argentinian exports to the East Asian country more than tripled
to 400,000 tons, according to the report.  “Chinese imports are picking up,” Oil World said. “The
latest exports of soybeans to China were quite impressive with
shipments from  South America  unusually high.”  Soybean futures have dropped 21 percent this year on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price has declined on speculation
that demand for raw materials used to make food and fuel will
fall amid faltering global economies.  China imported a total of 5.41 million tons from the U.S.,
 Argentina  and  Brazil  in November, up 3 percent from the same
period a year earlier, Oil World said. China’s share of the
soybean-import market was 58 percent last year, data from the
researcher show. Production in the country may fall 8.7 percent,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
