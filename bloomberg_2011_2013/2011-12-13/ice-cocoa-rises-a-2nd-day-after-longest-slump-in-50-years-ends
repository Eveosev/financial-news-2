Cocoa rose for a second day in New
York, following the longest slump in at least 50 years, after
Olam International Ltd. said output will trail consumption in
the season started Oct. 1. Sugar advanced.  Cocoa production will be 100,000 metric tons less than
consumption in 2011-12, with the crop in top global producer
 Ivory Coast  falling to 1.35 million tons, down from more than
1.75 million tons the previous season, Gerry Manley, managing
director and global head for cocoa at the company, said by phone
from London yesterday. Cocoa has fallen 9.2 percent in London
and 13 percent in New York over the past month on speculation
supplies would be better than initially estimated.  “Futures prices have been hit hard, with the sell-off over
the last six weeks from European debt concerns rivaling the
falls experienced immediately after the failure of Lehman in
2008,” Paul Deane, an economist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. wrote in a report e-mailed today. “Even with
last night’s bounce, prices are still hovering at levels more
consistent with 2007 levels.”  Cocoa for March delivery advanced 0.4 percent to $2,190 a
ton by 07:15 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The price,
which fell as much as 4.1 yesterday, later bounded to climb as
much as 8.7 percent. Prior to yesterday, it had fallen for 12
consecutive sessions, the longest slump since at least 1961.
Cocoa for March delivery climbed 0.8 percent to 1,430 pounds
($2,229) a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Money managers reduced their net-short position, or bets on
lower prices, in London cocoa by 55 percent in the week ended
Dec. 6, data from NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE
Euronext, show. Net-short positions fell to 2,695 from 5,995
futures a week earlier, according to the weekly commitments of
traders report published on the exchange’s website yesterday.  Australian Output  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.3 percent to 23.35
cents a pound on ICE. White, or refined, sugar for March
delivery rose 0.3 percent to $608 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Australia , set to be the world’s third-biggest sugar
exporter, lowered its output forecast 7.1 percent amid a decline
in plantings and lower yields.  Raw-sugar production may total 3.9 million tons in the year
to June 30, 2012, the  Australian Bureau  of Agricultural and
Resource Economics and Sciences said today in a report. That
compares with 4.2 million tons forecast in September and output
of 3.6 million tons in 2010-2011, it said.  Arabica coffee for March delivery was up 0.8 percent to
$2.2275 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for January delivery
was little changed at $1,884 a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
