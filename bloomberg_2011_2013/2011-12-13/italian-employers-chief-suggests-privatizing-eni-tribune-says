Italy’s new government should
privatize more companies, possibly including energy group  ENI
SpA (ENI) ,  Emma Marcegaglia , head of employers’ lobby Confindustria,
told  La Tribune  in an interview.  While praising the budget plan put forward by Prime
Minister  Mario Monti , Marcegaglia called for additional market
liberalization and privatization. “It’s not written in stone
that the state has to control 30% of energy group ENI,” she
told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
