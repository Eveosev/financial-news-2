Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH) , the U.K.
company looking for oil off the Falkland Islands, climbed the
most in five weeks in London after saying it found hydrocarbons
in four fields.  The 14/15-4 exploration well penetrated the Beverley,
Casper South, Casper and Sea Lion reservoirs and showed that all
targets contain some oil or gas, the company said today in a
statement in London. At the potentially commercial Sea Lion
field, the well found 8 meters (26 feet) of net oil pay.  Rockhopper shares surged 12 percent to 268.5 pence as of
the 4:30 p.m. close of London trading.  Desire Petroleum (DES)  Plc,
which has a 40 percent interest in the well, gained 2 percent.  “This fantastic result from our most aggressive well of
the campaign will further increase our minimum estimates of oil
in place for Sea Lion and Casper, in addition to proving two new
discoveries in Beverley and Casper South, which is our third oil
discovery in the basin,” Chief Executive Officer Sam Moody said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
