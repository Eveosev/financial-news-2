The  Seattle  Seahawks defeated the St.
Louis Rams 30-13 to keep their slim National Football League
playoff chances alive with a fourth win in five games.  Marshawn Lynch rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown as the
Seahawks won last night’s matchup at Seattle’s CenturyLink Field
between a pair of teams with losing records.  At 6-7, the Seahawks trail Detroit and Atlanta by two games
in the race for the two wild card playoff spots in the National
Football Conference. They’re also one game behind Dallas and
 Chicago  with three weeks left in the regular season.  Seattle would likely have to win its remaining games
against Chicago,  San Francisco  and  Arizona , and have other wild
card contenders lose multiple games to have a shot at making the
playoffs.  Michael Robinson returned a blocked punt 17 yards for a
touchdown, Tarvaris Jackson threw a 29-yard scoring pass to Doug Baldwin and Steven Hauschka kicked three field goals for the
Seahawks, who started the season 2-6.  The Rams have lost four straight games and are now 2-11,
tied with Minnesota for the NFL’s second-worst record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
