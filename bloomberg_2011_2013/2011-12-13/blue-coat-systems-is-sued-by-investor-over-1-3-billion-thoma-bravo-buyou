Blue Coat Systems Inc. (BCSI) , a provider
of Internet-security software, was sued by an investor who
contends the stock is undervalued in a planned $1.3 billion
buyout by a group headed by Thoma Bravo LLC.  Directors of the Sunnyvale, California-based company have a
duty to get the best possible price for the stock, and
negotiated an inadequate premium in the $25.81-a-share deal,
 lawyers  for Robert N. McLain said in a Delaware Chancery Court
complaint made public today in Wilmington.  The agreement offers Blue Coat shareholders a premium “of
only 14 percent over its average daily trading price for the
preceding year,” according to the complaint. The stock rose 5
cents to $25.20 at 2:21 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading.  “It’s our policy not to comment on legal matters,” Steve Schick, a Blue Coat spokesman, said in an e-mailed message.  Blue Coat is looking for $465 million in loans to back the
takeover, including a $415 million term loan and a $50 million
revolving line of credit, according to a Dec. 9 regulatory
filing.  The case is Robert N. McLain v. David Hanna and Blue Coat
Systems Inc., CA7105, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
