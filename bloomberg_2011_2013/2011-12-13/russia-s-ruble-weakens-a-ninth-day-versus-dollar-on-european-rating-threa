The ruble strengthened for a second
day against the euro, erasing earlier losses as oil,  Russia ’s
chief export earner, rose in  New York .  The Russian currency gained 0.1 percent to 41.735 per euro
at the close in Moscow. The ruble was little changed at 31.585
per dollar, leaving it steady at 36.1525 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Crude futures climbed 2.9 percent to $100.64 a barrel in
New York after the ZEW Center for European Economic Research
said German investor confidence improved for the first time in
10 months. Oil and natural gas account for about 40 percent of
Russia’s state revenues and 17 percent of the country’s gross
domestic product.  Russia’s dollar Eurobonds due in July 2018 snapped five
days of losses, pushing the yield down six basis points to 4.431
percent. Investors expect the ruble to reach 32.0383 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 32.091 per dollar
yesterday, non-deliverable forwards show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
