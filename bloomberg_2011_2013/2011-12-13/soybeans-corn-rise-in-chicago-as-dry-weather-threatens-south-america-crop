Soybeans rose the most in more than
a week and corn gained for the first time in three sessions as
adverse weather threatens to reduce crop yields in  South
America .  Dry weather in the next 10 days will reduce soil moisture
and increase stress on crops in parts of Argentina, Paraguay and
 Brazil ,  T-Storm Weather LLC  said in a report. About 40 percent
of the growing area has been drier than normal since Nov. 15 in
Brazil, which the U.S. government ranks as the biggest global
 shipper  of soybeans this year.  “After a fast start to planting crops in the last two
months, the drier weather is becoming a concern,” Greg Grow,
the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc.
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “People have been
betting on record or near-record production in South America,
and that is now coming into question.”  Soybean futures for January delivery gained 0.6 percent to
close at $11.185 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since Dec. 2. Yesterday, the price
touched $10.95, the lowest for a most-active contract since
October 2010. The oilseed has dropped 20 percent this year on
rising world production and U.S. inventories.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to $5.945
a bushel. The grain has slumped 5.5 percent this year as rising
global output reduced demand for U.S. supplies.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
