U.S. stocks fell, while the dollar
and Treasuries rallied, as the  Federal Reserve  refrained from
taking more steps to stimulate the economy and concern grew that
European leaders won’t agree on ways to expand the region’s
bailout capacities. Gold slumped to a seven-week low.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.9 percent to
1,225.73 at 4 p.m. in New York, wiping out a gain of as much as
1.1 percent. The Dollar Index rose 1 percent,  topping 80 (DXY)  for the
first time since January, as the euro fell on reports that
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  rejected boosting  Europe ’s
permanent bailout fund. Ten-year Treasury yields slipped five
basis points to 1.97 percent following stronger-than-average
demand at an auction. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities rose 1.5
percent after surging as much as 2.3 percent.  Stocks headed lower as Fed policy makers said the U.S. is
maintaining growth even as the global economy slows and defied
speculation from some investors that the central bank would
signal plans for a third round of large-scale asset purchases
known as quantitative easing, or QE3. The Fed said it would
continue its exchange of $400 billion of short-term debt with
long-term securities to lengthen the average maturity of its
holdings, a move dubbed Operation Twist.  “Operation Twist remains in effect but there was no
mention of a QE3, or further coordinated action with the ECB,
which may have disappointed investors,”  Mark Bronzo , who helps
manage $23.5 billion at Security Global Investors in Irvington,
New York, said in an e-mail, referring to coordinated action
with the  European Central Bank .  Gains Erased  Earlier gains in stocks were triggered as German investor
confidence unexpectedly grew and  Spain  sold more debt than
planned at an auction.  Financial shares erased earlier gains after the Fed’s
statement, sending the 80 banks, insurers and investment firms
in the  S&P 500  down 1.5 percent as a group. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. sank 3.1 percent to help lead losses in the group.  Retailers were the biggest drag on the S&P 500 among 24
industries after the government reported sales rose in November
at the slowest pace in five months. The 0.2 percent gain  trailed (BBY) 
the median economist projection for a 0.6 percent increase. Best
Buy Co. decreased 15 percent, the most in nine years, after the
largest consumer-electronics retailer reported third-quarter
profit that trailed analyst estimates, hurt by Black Friday
promotional costs.  Treasury Auction  Treasuries reversed losses after the U.S. sale of $21
billion in 10-year notes. The securities drew a  yield  of 2.020
percent, compared with a forecast of 2.050 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Federal Reserve’s 21
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of debt offered, was 3.53,
the strongest level since April 2010.  Thirty-year Treasury yields lost five basis points to 3.00
percent, while two-year rates were little changed at 0.23
percent.  “I think people were short the back end of the curve, the
10- and 30-year point,” James Caron, head of U.S.  interest rate 
strategy at Morgan Stanley, told Bloomberg Television. “And
given that the Fed didn’t really have anything new in its
communication, it actually caused people to short-cover and that
caused the curve to flatten.”  The Fed’s statement reiterated a warning at two previous
meetings that “Strains in global financial markets continue to
pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.” Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month that the sentence
refers to the European debt crisis.  ‘Exceptionally Low’  The Fed left unchanged its statement that economic
conditions are likely to warrant “exceptionally low” interest
rates “at least through mid-2013.” The central bank lowered
its target overnight interest rate to a range of zero to 0.25
percent in December 2008.  Cocoa, gasoline and oil jumped more than 2 percent to lead
gains in 15 of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI gauge.
Gold futures for February delivery dropped 2 percent to
$1,635.20 an ounce in electronic trading on the Comex in  New
York . At the close of floor trading, the price was down 0.3
percent to settle at $1,663.10. The metal touched $1,634 today,
the lowest since Oct. 21.  Crude settled up 2.4 percent at $100.14 a barrel and
advanced as much as 3.6 percent after the state-run Fars news
agency reported the Iranian military drills to close the  Strait
of Hormuz  will be “soon,” citing Parvis Sorouri, a member of
the parliament’s national security and foreign policy committee.
The strait is a bottleneck for oil exports from the  Persian
Gulf .  European Shares  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  rose 0.5 percent, paring a gain
of as much as 1.2 percent. Gauges of energy and mining stocks
led gains among 19 industry groups, jumping more than 1.5
percent. Lagardere SCA,  France ’s biggest publisher, rose 3.3
percent after Deutsche Bank AG upgraded the shares. Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and BP Plc gained more than 1.7 percent. Declines in
banks and insurers limited gains on the Stoxx 600 with Banco
Santander SA and BNP Paribas SA, the largest lenders in Spain
and France, respectively, dropping at least 1.5 percent.  The ZEW Center’s  confidence  index increased to minus 53.8
in December from a three-year low of minus 55.2 the previous
month. The gauge was forecast to drop to minus 55.8, according
to the median of 34 estimates in Bloomberg survey of economists.
Its index of current conditions fell to 26.8 from 34.2 in
November, compared with a reading of 31 in a Bloomberg survey.  European Bond Yields  The yield on Spain’s 10-year note slipped eight basis
points to 5.71 percent after climbing earlier. The government
sold 12-month debt at an average yield of 4.050 percent,
compared with 5.022 percent at an auction on Nov. 15, and 18-
month bills at 4.226 percent,  down (S5FINL)  from 5.159 percent last
month.  The two-year Italian note’s yield slipped 18 basis points
and the nation’s 10-year yield rose 12 basis points to 6.69
percent after climbing as much as 19 basis points.  The European Financial Stability Facility, the region’s
temporary bailout fund, sold 1.97 billion euros of 91-day bills
at an average yield of 0.2222 percent, the Bundesbank said.
Investors bid for 3.2 times the amount sold, according to data
from the central bank.  The 17-nation euro currency dropped against 13 of its 16
major counterparts after Merkel told German coalition lawmakers
that the 500 billion euro ($654 billion) cap on Europe’s planned
permanent bailout fund will stay in place, two officials with
knowledge of the discussion said.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  fell 1.1 percent, the
lowest on a closing basis since Nov. 29.  South Korea ’s Kospi
Index sank 1.9 percent after Morgan Stanley cut its rating for
the nation’s equities to “equal-weight” from “overweight.”
The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.9 percent to a more than
two-year low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
