Mauritius raised its 2011 sugar-crop
forecast for the second time in a month to 430,000 metric tons,
the Chamber of Agriculture said.  Output will probably exceed the 410,000 tons estimated on
Nov. 15 because of higher yields, the Port Louis-based chamber
said today in a statement e-mailed by the Mauritius Sugar
Syndicate.  The Indian Ocean island nation produced 452,473 tons of the
sweetener last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
