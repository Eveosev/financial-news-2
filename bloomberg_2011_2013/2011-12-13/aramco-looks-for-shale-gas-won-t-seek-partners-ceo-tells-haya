Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will explore
for natural gas in shale rock formations in the kingdom to
determine the extent of available resources, Chief Executive
Officer Khalid al-Falih told  al-Hayat .  The company, known as  Saudi Aramco , won’t invite
international  oil companies  to join as partners in the
enterprise, al-Falih said in an interview with the newspaper.
 Saudi Arabia  consumes 500,000 barrels of oil a day on average to
generate power and to desalinate water, al-Falih was cited by
the newspaper as saying.  Aramco’s Manifa oil field development is aimed at
maintaining the company’s production at 12 million barrels a day
as it slows output from older fields, al-Falih said. If Aramco
were to pump crude from Manifa and older wells at full capacity,
it could produce as much as 12.9 million barrels a day, al-Hayat
cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
