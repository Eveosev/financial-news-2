OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) ,
the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , said
preparations to produce its first crude before the end of this
month are in the “final phase.”  The installation of production lines at its Waimea field
off Rio de Janeiro’s coast is almost complete and a plan to
start producing before the end of the year hasn’t changed, the
company said in an e-mailed response to questions today. The
floating platform that will pump oil from the field still hasn’t
left Rio’s port.  OGX, which aims to reach 150,000 barrels a day of output in
2013 as it develops discoveries off Brazil’s coast, will take
about two weeks to connect the platform to an oil well as soon
as the unit reaches Waimea, Ricardo Abi Ramia, a production
manager at the Rio-based company, said in an Aug. 11 conference
call.  OGX fell 0.8 percent to 14.28 reais in Sao Paulo trading at
4:08 p.m., extending its loss this year to 29 percent, compared
with a 17 percent decline in the benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
