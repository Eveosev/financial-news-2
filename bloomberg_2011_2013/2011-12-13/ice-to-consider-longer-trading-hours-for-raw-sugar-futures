ICE Futures U.S. plans to consider
starting trading earlier for raw-sugar futures after a committee
voted to approve the move.  The proposal to begin trading at 2:30 a.m. New York time
during daylight savings time and 1:30 a.m. the rest of the year
was approved 14-5 by the committee, according to an ICE e-mail
dated yesterday obtained by Bloomberg News. The recommendation
will be reviewed by the ICE board this week.  Trading for the sugar no. 11 contract, a global benchmark,
currently starts at 3:30 a.m. and runs until 2 p.m. ICE Futures
is part of  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) , based in Atlanta. The
company’s electronic exchanges also offer energy contracts and
futures in coffee, cocoa, cotton and orange juice. Sugar also
trades on rival exchanges in London and China  Extending sugar hours “has significant implications for
all market participants,” Tim Barry, a vice president of
product development, said in the e-mail. The committee’s
approval came “on the basis of what is in the best interest of
the contract versus more narrow concerns about the potential
effect of an earlier open time on individual circumstances,” he
said.  CME Group Inc. is the largest U.S. futures exchange,
followed by IntercontinentalExchange. ICE also offers trading in
sugar no. 16 for U.S. supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
