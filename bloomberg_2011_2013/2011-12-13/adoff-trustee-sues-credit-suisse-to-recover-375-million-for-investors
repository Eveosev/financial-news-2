Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  was sued by
the trustee liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s former investment firm
to recover $375 million in redemptions that were taken out of
con man’s company before his  Ponzi scheme  was exposed.  Trustee Irving Picard filed an adversary complaint
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for the return
of funds transferred to the Swiss bank by investors in Fairfield
Sentry Ltd. and Kingate Global Fund Ltd. The two so-called
feeder funds, which invested almost all their assets with
Madoff, are now in liquidation themselves, Picard said.  Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $19 billion in principal, Picard has said.
Picard has filed similar lawsuits to recover investments taken
out of Madoff’s firm.  “While we are still reviewing the complaint, there is no
allegation that CS did anything wrong,” Victoria Harmon, a
spokeswoman for Zurich-based Credit Suisse, said in an e-mail.
“This is simply another of the numerous claims the trustee has
filed in an attempt to clawback further funds.” ‬  The case is Picard v. Credit Suisse, 11-02925,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
