The  Ghana Stock Exchange Composite
Index  tumbled for an eighth day, dropping 2.2 percent to close
at 943.71, the biggest decline since Oct. 5.  The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  gained 0.4
percent to 19,871.97 in Lagos, according to a statement on the
bourse’s website. Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX)  rose 0.2 percent to
1,860.28 by the end of trading. The  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index (FTN098) 
fell for a fourth day, retreating 0.1 percent to 835.90 in
Windhoek. Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  fell for the first session in
three, declining less than 0.1 percent to 54.11 in Nairobi.  The following shares were active in sub-Saharan Africa,

nation’s fifth-largest lender by market value, fell 3.3 percent
to 11.6 shillings, the lowest close since April 2010, on
expectations of reduced earnings and increased provisions
against bad debt.  “The drop is due to expectations of reduced earnings on
account of lower credit growth and increased provision for
doubtful debt as the higher  interest rates  increase chances of
default,” Eva Njuguna a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview.  Lafarge WAPCO Nigeria Plc (WAPCO)  , a unit of Lafarge SA,
jumped by the daily limit of 5 percent to 42.84 naira, the
biggest rise since Aug. 12, as Nigeria’s cement companies
“should benefit from years of underinvestment and a fiscal
policy shift toward more public investment,” according to Tim
Drinkall, a New York-based fund manager at Morgan Stanley
Investment Management with $340 million in assets under
management in frontier markets.  Sasini Ltd. (STCL)  , a Kenyan tea and coffee producer,
declined for a second day, retreating 1.6 percent to 12.6
shillings, after reporting net income for the year to September
tumbled 60 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
