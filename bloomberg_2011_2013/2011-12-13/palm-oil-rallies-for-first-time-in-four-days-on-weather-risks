Palm oil  climbed for the first time
in four days after soybeans recovered from a 14-month low as hot
weather threatened crops in  South America .  The February-delivery contract advanced as much as 0.8
percent to 3,023 ringgit ($950) per metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange before ending the morning session at 3,014
ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . The contract fell 3.9 percent in the
past three sessions.  Hot weather may redevelop in Argentina’s soybean, corn and
wheat areas over the weekend and no significant rain is expected
through Dec. 18, Telvent DTN Inc. said in a forecast yesterday.
In Brazil, soybean crops are still vulnerable to damage from
dryness later in the month and in January, it said.  “Dry weather will be a concern for the soybean crop,
especially in  Brazil ,” Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip
Futures Pte., said by phone from  Singapore . “Regional weather
concerns including forecasts of floods in Indonesia’s growing
regions in December will also provide support to palm oil.”  January-delivery soybeans gained as much as 0.5 percent to
$11.175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade before trading at
$11.1175 at 1:31 p.m. Singapore time, while soybean oil for
March gained as much as 0.5 percent to 49.97 cents a pound.  Palm oil for delivery in May climbed as much as 0.5 percent
to 7,896 yuan ($1,241) per ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
and soybean oil for September advanced 0.6 percent to 8,774 yuan.  Output  in  Malaysia , the second-biggest producer after
Indonesia, declined 14.8 percent to 1.6 million tons in November
from a two-year high the previous month after the peak-harvest
season ended, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said today.
Production was estimated at 1.7 million tons in a Bloomberg News
survey of four analysts and two plantation companies first
published on Dec. 6.  “The peak-production period is over,” Ker said. “Harvesting
was also affected by adverse weather.”  Stockpiles declined 1.5 percent to 2.1 million tons, while
exports shrank 9.9 percent to 1.7 million tons, the board said
after the close of morning trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
