Iraq will account for about 80
percent of the forecast increase in OPEC’s crude-oil production
capacity by 2016, according to the  International Energy Agency .  The 12-member group of oil-exporting nations will be
capable of producing 38.1 million barrels a day in five years,
up from 35.8 million in 2010, the IEA said in a report today.
Iraq’s crude output is predicted to increase by 1.87 million
barrels a day to 4.36 million.  The Paris-based agency lifted its Iraq outlook by 335,000
barrels a day from its June estimate, citing “steady progress
at the country’s 12 joint venture projects.” The IEA also
warned that the withdrawal of U.S. troops this year may
jeopardize stability.  The recovery in  Libya ’s output also exceeded expectations
in 2011, with output forecast to rise to pre-war levels of 1.6
million barrels a day by 2014, the agency said. Libya pumped
500,000 barrels a day in November, from a low of 45,000 barrels
in the midst of the rebellion against former leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
