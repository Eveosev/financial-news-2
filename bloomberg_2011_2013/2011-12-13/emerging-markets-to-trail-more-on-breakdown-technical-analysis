Emerging market stocks’  relative
strength (MXEF)  chart to U.S. equities produced a “head and shoulders
breakdown” pattern, a signal  developing countries ’ shares will
continue to underperform next year, Bank of America Corp. said.  The ratio of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index to the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index reached a 16-year high of 0.96 in
October 2010 and stayed mostly above 0.80 from May 2009 through
September this year, forming a two-year “head and shoulders”
pattern, and has declined since then, data from Bloomberg and
Bank of America show. A head and shoulders pattern is formed by
three consecutive peaks on a chart, the highest in the middle.  “The relative chart of MSCI Emerging Markets index to the
 S&P 500  has a massive head and shoulders breakdown,” Mary Ann Bartels, New York-based head of U.S. technical and market
analysis at Bank of America, wrote in a note dated yesterday.
This is “the biggest risk we see for 2012,” she wrote, and
“suggests emerging markets should significantly underperform
the S&P 500 as we enter 2012.”  The emerging market index has slumped 20 percent this year,
compared with a loss of 1.7 percent in the S&P 500, amid concern
economic growth will slow from China to  Brazil . The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  yesterday fell to the lowest level since March
2009 as data showed exports in the largest developing country
rose by the least in two years.  The ratio of the emerging markets index to the S&P 500 sank
to 0.73 in October, the lowest level since April 2009. A falling
ratio shows emerging markets are lagging behind the U.S.  The gauge for emerging-market stocks beat the U.S. index in
nine of the past 10 years, on optimism that faster economic
growth would bolster earnings for companies from  China  Mobile
Ltd. to Petroleo Brasileiro SA.  Losing in 2012 would mark the first time since Russia’s
default in 1998 that developing countries underperformed for two
consecutive years, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
