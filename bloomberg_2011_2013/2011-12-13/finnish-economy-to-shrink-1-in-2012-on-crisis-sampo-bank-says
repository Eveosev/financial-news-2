Finland’s economy will grow 1
percent in 2012 and 2.4 percent in 2013, Svenska Handelsbanken
AB said in an e-mailed report today.  Growth is driven by private consumption as anemic demand
for exports weighs on investments, Tiina Helenius, the bank’s
Helsinki-based chief economist, said in the report. The bank had
previously forecast growth of 1.8 percent for next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
