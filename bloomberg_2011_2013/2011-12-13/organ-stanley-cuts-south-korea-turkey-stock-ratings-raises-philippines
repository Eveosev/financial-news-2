Morgan Stanley cut its rating for
South Korean equities to “equal-weight” from “overweight” on
valuations and lowered Turkey and Peru to “underweight” from
“equal-weight.”  Valuations on South Korean stocks are “full” after
outperforming the MSCI Emerging Markets Index this year,
 Jonathan Garner  and Pankaj Mataney, analysts at Morgan Stanley,
wrote in a report dated yesterday.  South Korea ’s  Kospi index (KOSPI) 
lost 7.3 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a 20
percent decline by MSCI’s developing-nation gauge.  Turkey is the “most vulnerable” among emerging markets to
a stop in cross-border bank lending and has the largest current
account deficit relative to its economy, the analysts wrote.
Turkey’s current-account gap in October was $4.2 billion, taking
the 12-month cumulative deficit to a record $78.6 billion, the
central bank in Ankara said yesterday.  Chile and Colombia were raised to “equal-weight” from
“underweight,” while the Philippines was boosted to
“overweight” from “equal-weight,” according to the note.  Chile has improved on earnings growth, while the shares are
“oversold,” Morgan Stanley wrote. The MSCI Chile Index has
lost 22 percent this year.  The Philippines “earnings revision breadth” compared with
 emerging markets  “continues to improve,” helped by domestic
industries including consumer-discretionary, financial and
industrial companies, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
