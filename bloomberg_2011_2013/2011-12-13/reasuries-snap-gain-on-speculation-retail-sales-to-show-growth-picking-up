Treasuries pared losses on concern
European leaders wont’ agree on how to expand the region’s
rescue capacities as debt-strapped nations struggle to fund
their budget deficits.  U.S. government debt  fell earlier as investors prepared for
a $21 billion auction of 10-year notes and Europe’s bailout fund
sold the maximum amount at its first auction of bills, reducing
the refuge demand for U.S. government debt. German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said the 500 billion-euro ($654 billion) upper
limit on Europe’s planned permanent bailout fund will remain in
place. The  Federal Open Market Committee  is meeting today.  “The market looks conflicted with the supply and headlines
coming out of Europe,” said  Sean Murphy , a Treasury trader at
Societe Generale in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “There are a lot of key issues going on. You
also have the FOMC to follow.”  Benchmark 10-year note yields gained two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.03 percent at 12:11 p.m.  New York 
time after reading 2.06 percent earlier, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. Yields on  30-year bonds  rose one basis
points to 3.06 percent after earlier touching 3.10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
