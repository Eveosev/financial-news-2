DuPont Co. (DD) , the chemical maker that
acquired Danisco A/S this year, said it expects profit margins
in the businesses it purchased to increase as it achieves $130
million of cost savings early and new products are introduced.  Pretax operating margins in the Nutrition and Health unit
may rise to between 12 percent and 14 percent in the “long
term,” from 7 percent in 2011, Craig Binetti, the president of
the business, said today at an investor presentation at DuPont
headquarters in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Margins will be boosted through achieving synergies by
2012, a year earlier than forecast, the company said. Sales in
Nutrition and Health may increase by between 7 percent and 9
percent a year from $2.5 billion this year.  Profit margins in Industrial Biosciences are forecast to
expand to between 15 percent and 17 percent, from 10 percent in
2011, as the company begins licensing technology for making
butanol and ethanol from plants, said  Jim Collins , the president
of the unit. Sales may rise between 10 percent and 12 percent a
year, from about $700 million currently.  DuPont will review its other businesses when the investor
presentation continues tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
