Ferrovial SA (FER)  has offered the Madrid
administration cost cuts of up to 20 percent to boost business
with the city,  Expansion  reported, citing Santiago Olivares,
chief executive officer of builderâ€™s services unit.  The builder plans to gain market share in Madrid at the
expense of rivals including  Fomento de Construcciones y
Contratas SA (FCC)  and ACS Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA
as the municipality regroups services and sets new criteria, the
newspaper said.  Madrid service contracts, including waste management, are
valued at about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) annually,
Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
