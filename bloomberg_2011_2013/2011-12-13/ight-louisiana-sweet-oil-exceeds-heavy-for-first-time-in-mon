Light  Louisiana  Sweet oil’s premium
versus U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate exceeded the
premium for Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude for the first time in
more than a month.  The heavy oil had been at a  premium  to the light grade
since Nov. 7 after Exxon Mobil Corp. shut its Southwest System
Pipeline in Louisiana “indefinitely” on Oct. 31. The Irving,
Texas-based company closed the line after the U.S. Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration rejected the company’s
request to waive federal safety requirements.  The 12-inch pipeline runs from  South Bend  to Krotz Springs,
Louisiana, and delivers the heavy oil to Exxon’s North Line
system and its refinery in  Baton Rouge , Louisiana, according to
the company’s website.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium narrowed 60 cents to $11.30
a barrel at 12:50 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI widened 10
cents to $11.50 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI decreased 10 cents to $8.75.
The premium for Mars Blend narrowed 25 cents to $6.80 a barrel.
 Poseidon  lost 15 cents to $6.30 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium increased 30 cents to $6.30
a barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount widened 5 cents to 85
cents.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  was unchanged at
$15.35.  Syncrude ’s premium was unchanged at $2.50 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
