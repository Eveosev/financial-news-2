The U.K. coalition government’s
approach to reducing the deficit was supported by 74 percent of
respondents to a poll by ComRes, it said in a statement today.  Three out of four respondents agreed that the government
should not increase public borrowing and should eliminate the
deficit as soon as possible, the poll, conducted for the
Independent newspaper, found, the statement said.  Taken after after the European Union summit last week, the
poll also found that support for the governing  Conservative
Party  and the opposition  Labour Party  was equal, at 38 percent,
while the  Liberal Democrats , the Conservative’s coalition
partner, had 12 percent, the statement said. Support for Labour
had slipped 2 percentage points since a ComRes poll taken just
before the summit, while support for the Conservatives and the
Liberal Democrats had risen 2 points, the statement said.  While about 68 percent are optimistic about their own
future, only 34 percent said they were optimistic about the
U.K.’s prospects for next year, ComRes said. Sixty percent said
they aren’t optimistic about the country’s fortunes in the next
12 months.  ComRes interviewed 1,002 U.K. adults by telephone between
Dec. 9 and Dec. 11, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
