Groupama SA , the French insurer hurt
by losses on Greek sovereign debt and stock investment declines,
said it will sell part of its stake in real-estate company Silic
SA to state-owned Caisse des Depots et Consignations.  The insurer will sell about a 6.5 percent stake in Silic in
exchange for about a 2.7 percent stake in Caisse des Depots unit
 Icade (ICAD)  SA, the companies said in an e-mailed statement today.
Icade will at a later stage make a public offer for all of
Silic’s shares, the companies said. The exchanges will be based
on a ratio of five Icade shares for four Silic shares, the
companies said.  CDC will also inject 300 million euros ($391 million) in
Groupama’s unit Gan Eurocourtage by subscribing to preferred
shares, the companies said.  CDC, the Paris-based state-owned bank, and customer-owned
Groupama said Dec. 4 they were in talks about CDC participating
in Silic through an exchange with Icade shares. The Paris-based
insurer owns a 44 percent stake in Silic, which has a market
value of 1.22 billion euros.  Groupama named Thierry Martel as chief executive officer in
October, ending the 11-year-long tenure of his predecessor, Jean
Azema. The company approved on Nov. 25 a 500 million-euro
capital injection from the group of regional insurance firms
that own its holding company to help improve solvency
“flexibility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
