The  Czech Republic  should fund the
mechanism aimed at tackling the euro areaâ€™s crisis only if all
other European Union states outside the euro region contribute
as well,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing Premier Petr Necas.  The government should ask the central bank to provide part
of its foreign exchange reserves in a funding for the
 International Monetary Fund  only if there was a threat that the
Czech Republic would become isolated, the newspaper cited Necas
as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
