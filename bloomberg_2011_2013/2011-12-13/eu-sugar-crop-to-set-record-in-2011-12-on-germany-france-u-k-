Sugar production in the European
Union will climb to a record in the 2011-12 season on bigger
harvests in  France ,  Germany  and the U.K., according to
French crop office FranceAgriMer.  EU sugar output will climb 15 percent to 18.25 million
metric tons in the 12 months ending in September, FranceAgriMer
estimated in a report e-mailed today. The bigger crop may result
in greater stockpiles, the office said.  The EU sugar regulations allow producers to sell a fixed
quantity for food use in the bloc’s internal market, while the
remainder must be exported, used by industry or stored until the
next season. The European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm,
on Nov. 24 authorized local producers to sell an additional
400,000 tons of the sweetener within the bloc to ease shortages.  White, or refined, sugar futures have dropped 19 percent in
 London  in the past year as traders speculated that supply would
expand. Output will exceed demand by about 9.7 million tons in
the October to September period, researcher Kingsman SA
forecasts.  German sugar production will climb 1.2 million tons,
France’s will rise 700,000 tons and the U.K. will produce
350,000 tons more than in 2010-11, according to FranceAgriMer.
Sugar output will rise in most countries in the bloc, with the
exception of Italy and  Austria , where crops will drop by 200,000
tons and 35,000 tons respectively this season, it said.  Europe  will likely import 3.1 million tons of sugar this
season and export 2.05 million tons, the crops agency said in
the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
