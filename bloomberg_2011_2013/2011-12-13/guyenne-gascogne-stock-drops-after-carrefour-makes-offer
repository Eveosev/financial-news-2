Guyenne & Gascogne SA (GG)  fell the most
in a year and a half in Paris trading after  Carrefour SA (CA) ,
 Europe ’s largest retailer, offered buy its main French
franchisee for less than the stock’s trading price.  Guyenne, whose shares were suspended before the market
opened yesterday, dropped as much as 7.7 percent to 80.87 euros,
the biggest intraday decline since May 25, 2010, and was down
6.6 percent at 1:13 p.m. That narrowed the stock’s gain this
year to 1.4 percent.  Carrefour said yesterday that it will pay investors owning
about 57 percent of Guyenne’s capital 74.25 euros a share for
about half their holdings and 3.9 Carrefour shares for each
remaining Guyenne share. The franchise operator will pay an
interim dividend of 7 euros a share prior to the closing of the
offer, Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based Carrefour said.  Guyenne operates six Carrefour hypermarkets and 27
Carrefour Market supermarkets in southwestern  France , according
to the Bayonne-based company’s website. It also holds 50 percent
of a joint venture with the retailer that owns 13 Carrefour
hypermarkets in the country and has a stake in Carrefour’s
Spanish business.  The Beau family and First Eagle Investment Management LLC,
which together hold 41.45 percent of Guyenne, have agreed to a
12 month lock-up on the Carrefour shares they will receive in
the offer, the retailer said.  Altis  Put Option   Carrefour said in a separate statement yesterday it plans
to exercise its put option on its 50 percent stake in Altis
Group, another French franchisee, and will receive 153 million
euros ($202 million) in cash for the holding.  “In all, the dilutive impact of this transaction for
Carrefour should be about 1.5 percent on earnings,” Arnaud Joly, an analyst at CA Cheuvreux in Paris, wrote today in a
note, referring to both announcements.  Carrefour shares were up 0.2 percent after rising as much
as 1.5 percent. The stock has fallen 34 percent this year amid
an extended sales slump at stores in France, where the company
is revamping outlets, supplying more own-label goods and
increasing promotions. The retailer lowered its 2011 profit
forecast on Oct. 13, the second reduction in three months,
saying it now expects a decline of as much as 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
