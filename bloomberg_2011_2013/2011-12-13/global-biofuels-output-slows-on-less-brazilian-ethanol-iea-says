World production of biofuels will
increase at a slower pace than previously forecast in the next
five years as  Brazil ’s ethanol output declines and the U.S.
market becomes saturated, the  International Energy Agency  said.  Global growth is estimated at 400,000 barrels a day from
2010 until 2016, compared with the earlier forecast of 500,0000
barrels a day, the Paris-based agency said today in its monthly
Oil Market Report.  Brazilian ethanol production in 2011 is set to drop by
75,000 barrels a day to 375,000 barrels a day on a “poor sugar
cane harvest and high sugar prices” and will reach 530,000
barrels a day in 2016, according to the IEA.  In the U.S., the expiry of a 45 cent-per-gallon blenders’
tax credit at year-end is expected to sap distillery investment
as the market gets more saturated, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
