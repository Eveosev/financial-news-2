The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries boosted its 2012 demand estimate for its
crude for a second month as it lowered estimates for supplies
from outside the group.  OPEC, which meets tomorrow in Vienna, will need to produce
30.1 million barrels a day to balance global crude supply and
demand, the group’s secretariat said today in its monthly
report. That’s up 100,000 barrels a day from its forecast last
month. OPEC cut its global demand forecast for 2012.  “Economic turbulence is shaking oil demand as the slowdown
hits manufacturing activities worldwide,” OPEC said.  The group, which failed to reach an agreement on production
quotas in June, will use its demand forecast for next year as a
basis for discussion on output at the meeting, a person with
knowledge of OPEC’s policy said on Dec. 6. OPEC will need to
pump 30.2 million barrels a day next year, the  International
Energy Agency  said in its monthly report today. That marked a
downward revision of 200,000 barrels from its November forecast.  Supply from outside the group is projected at 53.1 million
barrels a day, a downward revision of 150,000 barrels a day from
last month. The U.S.,  Brazil , Canada, Colombia and Russia are
expected to boost output next year while declines are forecast
in Syria, Norway and Mexico, according to the report.  Oil demand will average 88.9 million barrels a day next
year, about 100,000 barrels less than its previous forecast, as
demand growth in  China  and  India  slows, it said. Consumption
will average 87.8 million barrels this year, according to OPEC.  OPEC’s production including  Iraq  averaged 30.37 million
barrels a day in November, compared with 29.81 million the
previous month, the report showed.  The group’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United
Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from quotas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
