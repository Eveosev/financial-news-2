Japanese  stock (MXAP)   futures  and
Australian equities fell after the  Federal Reserve  refrained
from taking new measures to spur growth and U.S. retail sales
rose at the slowest pace in five months, clouding the earnings
outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , which generates
20 percent of its sales in the U.S., fell 1.5 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender by market value, lost 1.9
percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , an Australian mining company,
dropped 1.5 percent in Sydney after metal prices fell.  Futures (TPX)  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 8,500 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,570 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,530 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped
0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.2 percent
in Wellington.  “The Fed didn’t say anything about a third round of
quantitative easing, which some in the market had expected,”
said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. “That disappointment led to a selloff in the
U.S. and should also be a negative factor for Japanese stocks.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.1 percent
today. The index dropped 0.9 percent in New York yesterday after
the Fed stopped short of offering another large-scale asset
purchases to boost the economy. Stocks also fell as a report
showed U.S. retail sales gained last month at the slowest pace
since June.  ‘Market Strains’  The Fed said in a statement that the U.S. economy continues
to expand even as global growth slows. The statement reiterated
a warning from the Fed’s two previous meetings that “strains in
global financial markets continue to pose significant downside
risks to the economic outlook.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 17 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 2.5 percent drop by the S&P
500 and a 14 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.4 times for the S&P 500
and 10.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 0.4 percent
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
