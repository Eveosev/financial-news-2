An Israeli army base in the  West
Bank  was vandalized overnight by some 50 “right-wing
activists” who set fire to tires and damaged vehicles, the army
said in an e-mailed statement today.  In a separate incident last night, 17 activists entered a
closed military zone on the border with Jordan and occupied an
abandoned structure in the area until they were ejected by
Israeli authorities, an Israeli army spokeswoman said, speaking
anonymously in accordance with military regulation.  The army “expects the local council heads and the
community rabbis to reject these severe activities,” the army
said.  The activists were spurred by rumors that  Israel  is
planning to evacuate several unauthorized settler outposts in
the West Bank in the near future, the Haaretz daily reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
