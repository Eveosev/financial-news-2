Gold futures slumped to a seven-week
low after the  Federal Reserve  refrained from taking new actions
to boost growth.  Most U.S. stocks fell and the dollar extended gains against
the euro after the Fed took no additional monetary policy steps
to stimulate the  U.S. economy . The central bank said the U.S. is
“expanding moderately, notwithstanding some apparent slowing in
global growth.”  “There were no substantial changes to the policies and,
hence, nothing to boost gold,”  William O’Neill , a partner at
Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, said in a
telephone interview. “The cautious statements from Fed will
continue to push investors towards risk-off trade.”  Gold futures for February delivery dropped 2 percent to
$1,635.50 an ounce at 3:24 p.m. in electronic trading on the
Comex in  New York . At the close of floor trading, the price was
down 0.3 percent to settle at $1,663.10. The metal touched
$1,634 today, the lowest since Oct. 21.  Imports by India, the world’s largest gold consumer, may
decline as much as 16 percent from a record as the rupee’s
plunge to an all-time low boosts local prices, according to the
Bombay Bullion Association. Purchases may fall as low as 800
tons this year from 958 tons in 2010,  Prithviraj Kothari , the
group’s president, said yesterday.  Silver dropped after the Fed statement, erasing earlier
gains. Futures for March delivery lost 1.2 percent to $30.62 an
ounce. At the close of floor trading, the metal rose 0.8 percent
to settle at $31.26 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
