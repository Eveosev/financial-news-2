The euro’s tumble below its weakest
levels against the dollar reached during October and November
suggests the 17-nation currency may weaken to its lowest level
this year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “If you see an intraday break like this it’s a sign that
the market is weak and there is still a trend for the market to
go lower, until we see the euro get above the levels it broke
down today, which is $1.3145 and extends up to $1.3212,” said
 Niall O’Connor , a New York-based technical analyst with
JPMorgan. “That we’ve broken some key chart levels is important
and suggests that there is still downside risk with potential to
extend to the January low.”  The euro traded 0.8 percent weaker at $1.3080 at 12:22 p.m.
after earlier gaining as much as 0.4 percent versus the
greenback.  A break below $1.3047, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci
retracement level from a four-year low reached in June 2010, may
send the shared currency to the weakest this year, according to
O’Connor. The 2011 low is $1.2867, reached on Jan. 10.  “Some people will look at $1.30 as a mental level, but
there is nothing technical there stopping it,” O’Connor said.
“If we start breaking $1.2860, it’s hard to spin that in a
positive way.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Technical analysts who use the
Fibonacci ratios, described by Leonardo of Pisa in “Liber
Abaci” in 1202, believe the price of an asset may reverse an
earlier gain or decline after reaching certain levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
