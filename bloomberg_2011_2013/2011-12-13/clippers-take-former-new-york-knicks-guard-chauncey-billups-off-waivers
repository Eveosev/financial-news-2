The  Los Angeles Clippers  picked up
former New York Knicks point guard  Chauncey Billups  off waivers
after pulling out of a proposed trade with the New Orleans
Hornets for Chris Paul.  Billups, 35, was waived three days ago as the Knicks
cleared salary cap space to add Tyson Chandler. A five-time
National Basketball Association All-Star, Billups averaged 16.8
points, 5.4 assists and 2.6 rebounds last season in 72 games for
the Knicks and Denver Nuggets.  Neil Olshey, the Clippers’ vice president of basketball
operations, said yesterday that the team wasn’t willing to match
the Hornets’ asking price for Paul, who’s been an All-Star each
of the past four seasons.  “We decided it wasn’t the right move for us based on the
package we’d have to give up,” Olshey said in an interview on
the team’s website. “Every team in the league would like to
have Chauncey. He’s one of the classiest guys in the league and
a great leader.”  Billups is entering his 15th NBA season. The Clippers also
retained center DeAndre Jordan by matching an offer sheet from
the  Golden State Warriors . The 6-foot-11 Jordan averaged 7.1
points and 7.2 rebounds last season.  The defending NBA champion  Dallas  Mavericks yesterday added
13-year veteran Vince Carter, an eight-time All-Star.  Carter, 34, joined the Mavericks after clearing waivers
from the Phoenix Suns. Dallas two days ago acquired forward
Lamar Odom in a trade with the  Los Angeles Lakers  after losing
Chandler to the Knicks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
