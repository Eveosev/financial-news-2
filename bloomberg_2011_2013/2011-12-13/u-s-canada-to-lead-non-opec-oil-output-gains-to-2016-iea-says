Non-OPEC oil supplies will rise by
about 3.4 million barrels a day from 2010 to 2016, led by the
U.S. and  Canada , according to the IEA.  The two North American nations will boost supply by about 3
million barrels a day, Brazil and Columbia will add 1.4 million
barrels and biofuels and improved fuel processing will account
for an extra 900,000 barrels, the Paris-based organization said
today in its Oil Market Report. Output declines in the  North Sea 
and Middle East countries not in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will partially offset the drops, it said.  The increase is due in part to higher exploration and
production spending as well as new technologies to boost
recovery rates against a background of record prices, according
to the report.  “U.S. liquids production is expected to grow by 20 percent
to reach 9.6 million barrels a day in 2016, on average 0.7
million barrels a day higher than our June estimate,” it said.
Shale oil and gas development is expected to increase field
condensate production, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
