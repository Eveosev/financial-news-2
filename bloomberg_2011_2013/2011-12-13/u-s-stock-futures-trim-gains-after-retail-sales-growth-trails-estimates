U.S. stock-index futures trimmed
gains after government data showed retail sales climbed less
than economists forecast in November.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March rose 0.5 percent at 8:32 a.m. in  New York  after earlier
climbing as much as 0.7 percent.    The 0.2 percent gain in retail sales followed a 0.6 percent
advance in October that was more than initially reported,
Commerce Department figures showed. Economists
projected a 0.6 percent November increase, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Purchases excluding
automobiles also rose 0.2 percent.  The S&P 500 slipped 1.5 percent yesterday, retreating after
a back-to-back weekly gain, as Moody’s Investors Service and
Fitch Ratings said the Dec. 9 euro-area accord failed to ease
the debt crisis and Intel Corp. cut its revenue forecast.  The  Federal Reserve  may keep its target rate in a range of
zero to 0.25 percent at a policy meeting today, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his policy-
making colleagues meet today to discuss the outlook for an
economy that has strengthened since their November gathering.
The  Federal Open Market Committee  will announce its interest-
rate decision at 2:15 p.m. in Washington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
