Lithuania  and Latvia had the
outlooks on their credit ratings cut to stable from positive by
 Fitch Ratings  because of a deteriorating external environment.  Fitch affirmed Lithuania’s BBB rating, the company’s
second-lowest investment grade, and Latvia’s BBB-, one grade
lower.  “Strong economic and financial linkages mean that
countries in central and eastern Europe are being adversely
affected by downward revisions to economic growth prospects and
heightened financial stress in the euro zone,” Ed Parker, a
managing director for emerging markets at Fitch in London, said
today in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
