The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  gained 0.6 percent to 12,844.10, while the
Colcap Index rose 0.9 percent to 1,585.82.  Banco de Bogota SA (BOGOTA)  , Colombia’s second-biggest
bank, rose 0.6 percent to 48,100 pesos after it sold $600
million of five-year bonds in overseas markets yesterday.  The lender sold the 5 percent dollar-denominated securities
to yield 5.25 percent, according to a filing yesterday on the
financial regulator’s website. Banco de Bogota, which had
initially offered to sell $500 million of the bonds, said
investor demand totaled more than $3.2 billion.  Citigroup Inc., HSBC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the
sale.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  , Colombia’s
second-biggest electricity distributor, gained the most in two
months as it resumed trading after a three-day suspension
following a plunge. Shares of EEB, as the city-run company is
known, gained 2.4 percent to 1,075 pesos. Shares earlier rose as
much as 4.3 percent, the most intraday in two months.  Colombia ’s securities regulator suspended trading of the
shares Dec. 7 following a 17 percent plunge over the three days
after Gustavo Petro, mayor-elect of the country’s capital, said
he would seek to merge the electricity company with other city-
controlled utilities.  “Petro seems to have taken on a more conciliatory tone,
the company has given the market new information about its
financial state and the trading suspension has given the market
some time to analyze what has happened,” said Santiago Melo, an
analyst at Alianza Valores SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
