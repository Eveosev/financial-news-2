India ’s 10-year  bonds  gained for a
second day after factory output shrank for the first time in
more than two years, adding pressure on the central bank to
loosen monetary policy.  Yields on the most-traded debt due 2021 declined to this
quarter’s lowest level after government data yesterday showed
that  factory output  fell 5.1 percent in October from a year
earlier, the first contraction since June 2009. The  Reserve Bank 
of India, which boosted its  repurchase rate  13 times since the
start of 2010 to cool inflation, is scheduled to review its
policy on Dec. 16.  “The bond rally may continue as monetary easing is around
the corner,” said  Roy Paul , a Mumbai-based deputy general
manager at Federal Bank Ltd. “Growth is faltering and inflation
worries are also waning.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.42 percent as
of 9:37 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year note
since September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation probably slowed to 9.04 percent in November from
9.73 percent the previous month, according to the median of
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey before the data is
published tomorrow.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
fell four basis points to 7.75 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate fell to a three-month low of
7.73 percent earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
