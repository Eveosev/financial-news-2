Apple Inc. (AAPL) , fighting to protect
sales of the iPhone worldwide, was sued by a U.S. company
contending its products infringe two patents for caller-
identification technology.  Cequint Inc. of Seattle, a unit of data-network servicer
 TNS Inc. (TNS)  of Reston, Virginia, seeks unspecified damages and a
court order to stop Apple’s use of the inventions, according to
a complaint yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “Cequint has been damaged by Apple’s infringement” and
“will be irreparably harmed” unless stopped by a judge,
Cequint’s lawyers said in the complaint.  Apple, of Cupertino, California, has been battling
companies such as  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and HTC Corp. over
patents for mobile telephones and tablet computers.  Apple spokesman Colin Smith didn’t immediately return phone
and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Cequint Inc. v. Apple Inc., U.S. District
Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 7,200,212 and 6,353,664.  To contact the reporter on this story:
