Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB) ,
 Colombia ’s second-biggest electricity distributor, said the
“sudden and strong” plunge in its shares isn’t justified given
its “solid” financial results.  The company, known as EEB, will begin trading today after
Colombia’s financial regulator on Dec. 7 suspended it after
shares plunged 17 percent over three days following mayor-elect
Gustavo Petro’s comments that he would seek to merge it with
other city-controlled utilities.  EEB commented on its share price in a regulatory  filing 
late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
