Polish inflation quickened to a six-
month high  in November on a weaker zloty, leaving little room
for policy makers to ease borrowing costs even as the economy
slows because of the euro region’s debt crisis.  Consumer prices  rose 4.8 percent from a year earlier after
a 4.3 percent increase in October, the Warsaw-based  Central
Statistical Office  said today. The median estimate of 30
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 4.5 percent. Prices rose
0.7 percent from the previous month.  Inflation has remained above the central bank’s 2.5 percent
target since September last year even after the bank raised the
benchmark seven-day rate by a combined 1 percentage point in the
first half of 2011. The Monetary Policy Council left the rate
unchanged last week for a sixth month, saying a weak zloty is
the biggest inflation risk.  “The effect of a weaker zloty is becoming more and more
visible across entire categories in the consumer-price basket,”
Ernest Pytlarczyk, chief economist at BRE Bank, wrote in a note
before the release.  The zloty tumbled 13 percent against the euro in the
past six months, the biggest drop among currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Poland  sells 54 percent of its exports to the
euro area and western banks own 59 percent of its bank assets.  Economic slowdown in the euro region and a weaker zloty
offset each other as far as the impact on inflation goes,
keeping “the chances for rate moves either way” unchanged
since the meeting last month, central bank Governor Marek Belka
said Dec. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
