Avoid New York’s big stores jammed
with fullback shoppers and endless queues.  Cool gifts can be found in less populated neighborhoods of
downtown  Manhattan .  Aedes de Venustas  Open on Christopher Street since 1995, Aedes de Venustas is
a heaven of scents. In a room decorated with burgundy and gold
tones reminiscent of a Renaissance canvas, the shop hosts a vast
and nicely displayed collection of candles, perfumes and creams.  Brands include  Cire Trudon , which lit the intrigues of the
18th-century French court, and the  Diptyque  line of scented
candles. My pick is the latter’s “ Tubereuse Rouge ” ($90),
which combines unrivaled perfume in a fine and simple design.  Not to be found elsewhere are the “Ernesto” and “Abd el
Kader” pillar candles ($115) created especially for the store.  Before you leave, meet the Aedes de Venustas mascots, Shih
Tzus Romy and Lucy.  At 9 Christopher St. Information: +1-212-206-8674;

editions and other rare books.  It’s where you’ll find a $5,000 first edition of
Hemingway’s “A Farewell to Arms,” and where you’ll be likely
to spend your afternoon browsing, reading, looking and
marveling.  The store’s assortment includes signed copies of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” and  Albert Einstein ’s
“Out of My Later Years.”  At 17 Eighth Ave. Information: +1-212-924-5638;

Mimi Vang Olsen has been around since the 1980s, when  Greenwich
Village  was still a neighborhood of writers and artists. “It
was colorful,” she told me. “There were many characters, of
which very few are left.”  She remains, however, and continues to paint portraits of
pets in the same store she has owned for almost 30 years.  You call her up -- she doesn’t use computers -- and she’ll
arrange to meet the pet, take photos and discuss the outcome of
the work. An oil on canvas in one of several sizes takes a month
and $2,500.  For $150 she’ll paint your pet on holiday ornaments and
boxes. One image can be done in five days, and you’ll have your
pet on the Christmas tree every year.  At 545 Hudson St. Information: +1-212-675-5410.  Treasure & Bond  Treasure & Bond lies on West Broadway in the heart of SoHo
and offers a different take on retail and philanthropy, donating
all its profit to charities benefiting children.  Passing a larger-than-life piggy bank called Penelope or
Oscar (the name hasn’t been decided yet), I graze the loft-like
space and its colorful mix of clothing, accessories, home
furniture and jewelry. I am tempted by a cashmere scarf ($162),
a hat in fun colors ($265) and a bag of very familiar design for
$65.  No, it’s not an authentic  Balenciaga , but a cotton tote
with the front of the designer bag printed on one side, and its
back on the other -- much cooler than the real thing.  If you’re looking for jewelry, go for the handmade wool and
crystal necklace designed by  Akong London  ($840). It’s almost a
work of art.  At 350 West Broadway. Information: +1-646-669-9049;

Glassybaby is a great story -- it creates and sells hand-blown
glass cups, and gives part of the profits to charity.  The stock in 400 different colors comes from 70 artists
working in a Seattle factory. When the cup is used as a
candleholder, the colors change as they’re lit.  So far, the company has donated more than $650,000 to
charities involved with cancer patients. Each piece is $44.  At 555 Hudson St. Information: +1-917-546-6850;

You’ll find  Proenza Schouler ’s hip bags,  Alexander Wang ’s shoes
and  Rodarte ’s dresses in the $6,000 range. There are lace head-
pieces, multi-colored sunglasses, silk patterned scarves and
pieces by emerging designers, often being shown in the U.S. for
the first time.  The second floor features mostly Argentine designers. Worth
consideration are a pair of leopard-patterned fake-pony hair
shoes ($280), handmade wallets by Arandu and Ale Sly’s small
cowhide bags ($115).  Olympia Le Tan’s book-clutches imitate famous literary
works. You can have “Madame Bovary” for $1,630 and “The Glass
Menagerie” for $1,425.  There’s a sleeveless dress from the 1920s ornamented with
real silver beads ($2,530). If it flops, you can sell the
silver. I am told it might be worth more than the dress.  At 35 Howard St. Information: +1-212-219-2688;
