Australia , set to be the world’s
second-biggest wheat shipper, cut its forecast for agricultural-
export earnings on concern that the European debt crisis may
damp global economic growth and hurt commodity demand.  Earnings from farm, forest and fisheries products may total
A$38.4 billion ($38.6 billion) in the year to June 30, the
 Australian Bureau  of Agricultural and Resource Economics and
Sciences said today. That compares with A$38.6 billion forecast
in September and a revised A$36.1 billion in 2010-2011, it said.  Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday it will review the
ratings of European Union countries after a summit last week
failed to offer measures to end the crisis. Agriculture prices
including wheat may decline in 2012 on bigger harvests,
according to a report this month from Credit Suisse Group AG.  “Emerging economies, particularly in  Asia , continue to
underpin world economic activity, but weak private demand and
concerns over public debt levels have weakened activity in major
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
economies,” the Canberra-based bureau said in the report.
“Economic growth across non-OECD Asia is continuing, although
some easing has been observed.”  Farm-export earnings, including crops and livestock, may
total A$34.5 billion in the year to June 30, while forestry and
fisheries exports may total A$3.9 billion, the bureau said.
 Export  earnings are forecast gain for wheat, barley, cotton,
sugar and beef on continued Asian demand, the bureau said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
