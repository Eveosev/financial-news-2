U.S. stocks  erased gains (SPX)  as the
 Federal Reserve  refrained from taking new actions to boost the
economy, disappointing investors who speculated the central bank
would signal plans for a third round of quantitative easing.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,235.33 at 2:35 p.m. in New York after gaining as much as 1.1
percent earlier.  “The disappointment was due to a minority expecting QE3,”
 Philip Orlando , the New York-based chief equity market
strategist at Federated Investors Inc., said in a telephone
interview. His firm oversees about $355 billion. “We don’t
think that’s warranted. The economy is accelerating. If the
economy collapses or the threat of deflation becomes more
apparent, then the Fed may change its mind.”  Fed policy makers said the economy in the U.S. is
maintaining its expansion even as the global economy slows. to
lower borrowing costs.  “The economy has been expanding moderately,
notwithstanding some apparent slowing in global growth,” the
 Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement at the
conclusion of its meeting today in Washington. “While
indicators point to some improvement in overall labor market
conditions, the  unemployment rate  remains elevated.”  Earlier gains in stocks were triggered as German investor
confidence grew and Spain sold more debt than planned at an
auction.  The S&P 500 has struggled to stay above its 2010 closing
level of 1,257.64 since topping it during the last week of
October after slumping below it for almost three months. The
index has shown a year-to-date gain during 18 sessions since
Oct. 27, only to later turn lower for 2011. It is currently down
about 1 percent for the year, led by a 20 percent slide in
financial shares.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
