U.S. Senate Republicans elected  John Thune  of  South Dakota  to become the third-ranking leader in a
revision of their top team prompted by Senator Lamar Alexander’s
decision to step aside.  Thune, a second-term senator, ran unopposed to replace
Alexander of Tennessee as head of the Senate Republican
Conference, in charge of helping shape the party’s message.
Alexander, who announced the results in an e-mail, said in
September he would give up the position to focus on his 2014 re-
election and offer a more independent voice on deficit reduction
and other debates.  Alexander’s decision opened three leadership jobs. In
today’s only contested race, Republicans elected Senator  Roy Blunt  of Missouri for the No. 5 job, vice chairman of the Senate
Republican Conference. Blunt is a former House majority whip and
longtime legislator now in his first Senate term.  Blunt will replace Senator  John Barrasso  of Wyoming, who
will take over from Thune in the fourth-ranking position as
Republican Policy Committee chairman. Like Thune, Barrasso faced
no opposition to his rise up the ranks of a team led by Senate
Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  of Kentucky.  All of the leadership positions will be voted upon after
the 2012 elections, which will determine control of the Senate.
At that time, Republicans will pick a new No. 2 leader because
Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona plans to retire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
