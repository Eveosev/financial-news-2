Pandora Media Inc.  rose the most in
two months after the Internet radio service said its audience
expanded in each of the top 10 U.S. radio markets.  Pandora’s shares rose 6.5 percent to $10.57 at the close of
trading in New York, the biggest gain since Oct. 6. The average
number of people listening to Pandora for at least five minutes
during the average quarter hour rose between 13 percent and 25
percent from September in the 10 cities with the biggest radio
audiences, the company said in a statement today.  “The audience is going up, which suggests that this is a
service that consumers like,” John Tinker, New York-based
senior media analyst at Maxim Group LLC, said in a telephone
interview. “The numbers that came out today are beginning to
quantify just how many consumers they actually have in the key
markets.”  In November the weekly number of Pandora’s unique listeners
exceeded 1 million people for the first time in the  New York  and
Los Angeles metropolitan areas, according to the statement. The
company posted its biggest gain in the New York area, where
listenership rose 25 percent, the company said.  The Oakland, California-based company has faced growing
competition from Spotify Ltd., the music-streaming company that
began offering U.S. service in July. Pandora’s shares have slid
34 percent from the company’s June 14 public offering price of
$16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
