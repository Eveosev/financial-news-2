Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the investment
bank that boosted staff after the financial crisis, said it will
claw back 2011 bonuses from any employees who defect to
competitors next year.  Jefferies will award discretionary cash bonuses with one-
year restrictions, requiring they be repaid if workers join a
rival firm during that period, according to a memo sent to
employees today. Restricted cash paid in lieu of restricted
stock at the request of employees is subject to a separate 20-
month clawback, Chief Executive Officer  Richard Handler  and
Brian Friedman, chairman of the New York-based firm’s executive
committee, wrote in the memo.  “We believe this approach assures that our year-end
compensation pool will only accrue to the benefit of those who
are committed to the long-term success of our firm,” Handler
and Friedman said in the memo, which was reported earlier today
by Fox Business Network.  Jefferies set aside $1.17 billion for employee compensation
in the first nine months of its fiscal year, amounting to about
59 percent of net revenue, according to the firm’s latest
quarterly report. The one-year deferral applies to cash payments
that aren’t already subject to other terms, such as contractual
agreements, according to the memo.  “We are paying out a full compensation rate as a
percentage of revenues (albeit revenues below our collective
expectations), and the portion of our compensation that will be
paid in cash is among the highest percentages of cash among our
major competitors,” the two executives said in the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
