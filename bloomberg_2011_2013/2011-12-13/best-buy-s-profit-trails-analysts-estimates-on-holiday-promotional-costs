Best Buy Co. (BBY)  tumbled the most in
more than nine years after the world’s largest consumer-
electronics retailer’s third-quarter profit declined more than
analysts estimated, hurt by Black Friday discounts.  Best Buy fell 15 percent to $23.73 at the close in New
York, the biggest drop since Aug. 8, 2002. The shares have
slumped 31 percent this year.  Net income fell 29 percent to $154 million, or 42 cents a
share, in the quarter ended Nov. 26, from $217 million, or 54
cents, a year earlier, the Richfield, Minnesota-based company
said today in a statement. Excluding restructuring costs, profit
totaled 47 cents, trailing the 51-cent average of 23 estimates
in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Dunn opened stores at
midnight Thanksgiving night, five hours earlier than last year,
and increased discounts on flat-panel televisions, mobile
devices and movies to spur sales. Gross margin narrowed to 24.2
percent in the quarter from 25.1 percent a year earlier.
Analysts projected 25 percent.  “That’s the challenge that Best Buy faces in this
extremely competitive segment: to gain back share, they have to
become increasingly promotional,” John Tomlinson, an analyst at
ITG Investment Research in  New York , said today in a telephone
interview. “Unless increased sales roll to the bottom line,
investors aren’t going to be pleased.”  Full-Year Forecast  Sales by stores open at least 14 months rose 0.3 percent
compared to analysts’ prediction for a decline of 0.9 percent.
Total third-quarter sales increased 1.8 percent to $12.1
billion.  Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving and the start of
the  holiday shopping season , is so named because many retailers
are said to become profitable that day. Total Black Friday sales
increased 6.6 percent to $11.4 billion this year, ShopperTrak
said last month.  Best Buy reaffirmed its full-year forecast for adjusted
earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.65. Analysts projected $3.44.  In the U.S., online sales climbed 20 percent from a year
earlier, while same-stores sales advanced in tablet computers,
appliances, e-readers, movies and mobile phones, which rose 9
percent. Televisions posted a comparable-store sales decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
