Asian currencies declined, led by
 India ’s rupee and Thailand’s baht, after ratings companies said
last week’s European summit did little to ease the region’s debt
crisis, weakening the outlook for exports.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares fell 1 percent after
Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday the summit doesn’t
diminish the risk of credit-rating downgrades for European
nations.  Fitch Ratings  said a comprehensive solution hasn’t yet
been offered and predicted a “significant economic downturn”
in the region. Global investors sold $17.6 billion more South
Korean, Taiwanese and Thai stocks than they bought this year,
exchange data show.  “The European summit failed to reassure investors the debt
crisis will ease soon, and this is fueling concern about an
economic slowdown,” said Kim Doo Hyun, a senior currency dealer
at Korea Exchange Bank in Seoul. “Asian currencies, including
the won, will continue this weakening trend at least until year-
end.”  The rupee weakened to a record low, sliding 1 percent to
53.3750 per dollar as of 2:13 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched 53.5200.  Thailand ’s
baht dropped 0.8 percent from Dec. 9 to 31.20 as markets resumed
following yesterday’s public holiday. Indonesia’s rupiah
declined 0.6 percent to 9,105, while South Korea’s won and the
Philippine peso fell 0.6 percent to 1,153.99 and 43.885,
respectively.  ‘Much Weaker Outlook’  India’s rupee fell for a sixth day as factory output shrank
5.1 percent in October, the first contraction since June 2009,
the government reported yesterday.  “The fundamentals for the rupee are very weak,” J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based executive vice president at IndusInd
Bank Ltd., wrote in an e-mail today. “Domestic cues are bearish
and the external sector is yet to see the worst.”  Philippine data today showed exports fell 14.6 percent in
October from a year earlier, compared with a 27 percent decline
the previous month.  China ’s overseas sales rose 13.8 percent in
November, the smallest gain since 2009, as demand from  Europe 
declined, data showed last week.  The yuan dropped the most in more than a week as the
People’s Bank of China weakened its daily fixing by 0.1 percent,
the most since Nov. 24, to 6.3359 per dollar. The currency
declined 0.07 percent to 6.3652 in the  spot market , according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  “As the European debt crisis is likely to linger for
longer, China’s exporters are facing a much weaker outlook next
year,” said Tommy Ong, Hong Kong-based senior vice president of
treasury and markets at DBS Group Holdings Ltd.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit weakened 0.4 percent to
3.1790, the  Singapore dollar  dropped 0.2 percent to S$1.3015 and
Taiwan’s dollar retreated 0.1 percent to NT$30.260. Vietnam’s
dong rose 0.5 percent to 21,011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
