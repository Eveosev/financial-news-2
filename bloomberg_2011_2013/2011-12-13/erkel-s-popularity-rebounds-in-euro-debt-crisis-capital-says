German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
popularity among business and political leaders rebounded after
a slump in summer, with 70 percent of respondents saying she’s a
“strong” leader, Capital magazine said, citing a survey it
commissioned from polling company Allensbach.  That’s twice the support Merkel had in summer, when she
lost credibility after deciding to abandon nuclear power,
Capital said. Sixty-nine percent of respondents said Merkel does
well as a crisis manager in  Europe , the magazine said.  Eleven percent of respondents expect the euro region to
break apart and 78 percent back Merkel’s push for an economic
and fiscal union even at the expense of leaving some European
Union countries behind, Capital said.  Twenty-one percent said euro bonds are a “promising”
solution to the region’s debt crisis and 63 percent said the
 European Central Bank ’s reputation is permanently damaged after
buying euro region debt, it said.  Allensbach polled 500 decision-makers at businesses,
political parties and in administration, Capital said, without
saying when the survey was held and what the margin of error
was.  To contact the reporter on this story:
