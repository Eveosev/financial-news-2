It has become commonplace to compare and contrast the two rising Asian powers. The faster pace of  China 's growth is attributed to the simpler command chain of authoritarianism and one-party rule. Meanwhile, many bemoan Indian red tape, indecision and chaos, the apparent cost of the state's democratic character and its accommodation of diverse points of view. But might it be too simplistic to explain the development patterns of the two countries as simply the difference between autocracy and democracy? Might it be that India's growth is slower not so much because the country is democratic per se, but rather because of the kind of democracy it is? To get a sense of its pitfalls look no further than the  debate about foreign investment  over the past month, which culminated with the government's reversal in one week of the exact steps taken the week before. Is democracy, the idea, being made culpable for the failures of the parliamentary democratic system set up at the time of independence in 1947 in imitation of models close at hand, but urgently in need of recalibration -- like  the very idea of the Indian nation  -- today? Might it be that the fragmentation of India's Parliament among  more than three dozen  big and small political parties has produced not just what the  political scientist Arend Lijphart  calls a consensus democracy (as opposed to simpler two-party majoritarian democracies) but something beyond it, requiring its own moniker to represent a state of peculiar democratic stasis and entanglement -- perhaps a dissensus democracy? Over the years,  India's Parliament , where no party has enjoyed a simple majority since 1989, has become a  minefield  of clamor and disruption.  Much of this year's winter session , for instance, passed without a single new bill being debated because many of the opposition parties decided to bog down the government over a range of issues, most prominently  foreign direct investment  and a political scam. Were the spectacle of Parliament in session to be presented to a child, he or she might conclude that Indians were  going to enormous expense  to fund a drama that was, to borrow from Macbeth, "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." A  recent study  by an independent group,  PRS Legislative Research , showed that Parliament consistently fails to carry out its appointed work. In one particularly disastrous session, last winter, it  worked only 6 percent of the time . Were the members of Parliament office workers, this record would likely result in them being fired from their jobs. That they represent, between them, the aspirations of more than 1 billion people makes their conduct both tragic and farcical. Has the Indian system of parliamentary democracy miscast the balance between representation and efficiency, between a legislature that is elected and then also sits atop of an executive that must govern? This was the case powerfully made this week by the writer and member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor in an essay called " Shall We Call The President? " in Tehelka. Arguing that  India  should  consider a move to an American-style presidential system of government  that makes a clearer separation between the legislature and the executive, Tharoor offered a catalogue of the problems engendered by parliamentary-style politics in a field as vast and varied as India's: There's a good deal of merit in Tharoor's critique of the status quo. Very simply, at a crucial juncture in its history, India is facing a crisis of leadership. Over the last few years, and especially since the general elections of 2009, public confidence in both Parliament and government has been severely eroded. This isn't just because, as Devesh Kapur and Pratap Bhanu Mehta write in a pessimistic 2006 report called " Indian Parliament as an Institution of Accountability ," the fissures between political parties entrusted to work together in a common space such as Parliament have deepened, so that "the imperatives of electoral and party politics give politicians great incentives to delay important legislation just for the sake of delay." It is also because the government itself has appeared rudderless, with power concentrated in the party at its center, the Indian National Congress, broken up between the prime minister,  Manmohan Singh , the president of the Congress Party,  Sonia Gandhi , and her son  Rahul Gandhi , the Congress's heir apparent. When  Singh's decision to open up the country to foreign direct investment  was derailed last week by some of the Congress's coalition partners, neither of the Gandhis spoke in support of the prime minister, displaying what the  journalist Dhiraj Nayyar  called "the Congress Party's continued, and damaging, ambivalence on economic policy." As the historian Ramachandra Guha wrote recently in a piece called " The West places too much faith in Singh ": The mood of stasis and crisis in the country was summed up in a recent essay by the political scientist Sunil Khilnani, in a piece called " Why India Is At A Crucial Cossroads ": Where, then, will a new chapter in India's long tradition of political creativity and imagination, central to so many political movements across the world in the 20th century, come from? It seems hard to expect it from a ruling party in the grip of a political dynasty and a rhetoric of welfarist cant, a main opposition party sunk in an atavistic idea of cultural nationalism sometimes verging on outright bigotry. Nor does it seem likely to arise from a Parliament that has in great measure congealed -- as a striking chapter in Patrick French's  recent book on India shows  -- into a family business where last names count for more than good ideas (itself a reflection of a country still too accustomed to passing difficult questions through the filters of religion and caste). To be an Indian today is to live in a time that is both immensely exciting and profoundly sobering. (Chandrahas Choudhury, a novelist, is the New Delhi correspondent for the World View blog.
