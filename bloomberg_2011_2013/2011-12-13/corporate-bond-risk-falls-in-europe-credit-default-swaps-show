The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index linked to 15
governments dropped three basis points to 379 at 4:30 p.m. in
London. A decline signals an improvement in perceptions of
 credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 50 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped five basis points
to 788.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of swaps on 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings declined one to 184.75.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased 5.5 basis points to 320 and the
subordinated index was little changed at 567.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
