The World Sugar Committee, an
advisory group to ICE Futures U.S., recommended starting trading
of the No. 11 raw-sugar contract earlier, Reuters reported,
citing a letter from the group to the exchange.  The new hours, which still need the approval of the
bourse’s board, would mean a 30-minute overlap with trading on
 China ’s Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
