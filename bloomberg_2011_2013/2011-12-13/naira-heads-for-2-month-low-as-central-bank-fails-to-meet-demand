Nigeria ’s naira depreciated against
the dollar, declining to the lowest in two months, after the
central bank failed to meet demand at foreign-currency auctions.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.1
percent to 162.35 per dollar in interbank trading at 3:50 p.m.
in Lagos, its lowest since Oct. 17 on a closing basis, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria sold $200 million at a foreign-currency auction
yesterday, less than the $248.6 million  demanded  by lenders,
with the  marginal rate , which is also used as the prevailing
exchange rate, unchanged from the previous auction on Dec. 7,
the Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said in an e-mailed
statement. The last time lenders’ demand was met was Nov. 30.  The central bank on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint of its
exchange-rate band at the auctions to 155 naira per dollar from
150 naira as rising imports and weakening oil prices increased
pressure on the currency. Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest
economy depends on oil exports for more than 95 percent of
foreign income, according to the  Finance Ministry .  Dollar demand has exceeded the supply, “as at the central
bank auctions last week demand for US dollars was $474million,
London- based CSL Stockbrokers Limited said in e-mailed note to
clients today. “We believe that in time the naira will find a
new official rate of around 172.5 naira to the dollar, down from
the current official rate of N155 per dollar.”  Nigeria’s government will reduce spending to cut the fiscal
deficit to 2.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 from 3
percent this year, in a bid to help sustain growth in the West
African nation, President  Goodluck Jonathan  told lawmakers in
the capital, Abuja, today. Expenditure will increase 6 percent
to 4.8 trillion naira in 2012.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.6455 per dollar as of 3:50
p.m. in Accra, the nation’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
