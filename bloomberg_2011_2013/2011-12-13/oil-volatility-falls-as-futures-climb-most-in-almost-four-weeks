Oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose the most in almost four weeks on
speculation there may be a supply disruption.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, declined to 35.1 at 2 p.m. in  New York  from 36.8
yesterday. Futures rose on a report that  Iran  will hold drills
to close the  Strait of Hormuz , a bottleneck for oil exports from
the  Persian Gulf .  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were February $85 puts, with 3,040 lots changing hands as
of 2:12 p.m. in New York. The options fell 34 cents to 61 cents
a barrel. January $95 puts traded 2,508 lots, dropping 37 cents
to 11 cents. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Oil for January delivery was up $2.39, or 2.4 percent, to
$100.16 a barrel at 1:56 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , heading for the biggest gain since Nov. 16.  February $130 calls were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 6,185 lots changing hands. They
dropped 3 cents to 21 cents a barrel. The next-most active
options, February $135 calls, declined 2 cents to 17 cents on
volume of 5,808 contracts.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $150 calls with
38,023 contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 35,704
contracts and December 2012 $100 calls with 32,766.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
