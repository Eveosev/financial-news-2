BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
asset manager, plans to eliminate 59 jobs in  San Francisco 
starting at the end of January.  The company, based in  New York , disclosed the cuts in a
Dec. 7 state filing in  California . BlackRock owns the iShares
exchange-traded fund business, which is based in San Francisco.  BlackRock, which oversees $3.35 trillion, acquired the
iShares business in December 2009 through its purchase of
 Barclays Global Investors . The firm reshuffled the iShares
leadership in September, appointing Mark Wiedman as head of the
unit that is the world’s biggest provider of ETFs. BlackRock,
led by Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, had about
10,200 employees globally as of Sept. 30.  “In these challenging markets, BlackRock continues to
exercise financial discipline,” Bobbie Collins, a spokeswoman
for the company, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. “We
are focusing resources on key priorities while identifying ways
to streamline processes and reduce expenses. This has included
shifting some personnel, hiring select key talent, and in some
instances eliminating positions consistent with client needs.”  The iShares unit continues to be a “major growth
business” at BlackRock, Collins said, along with the firm’s
retirement products, the BlackRock Solutions advisory unit and
the multiasset investment group.  Job cuts announced by financial firms globally have risen
to more than 200,000 this year from about 58,000 in 2010 and
174,000 in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
