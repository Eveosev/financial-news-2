Greece ’s state budget deficit
widened 5 percent in the first 11 months of the year, better
than a revised target for the period.  The gap, which excludes outlays by state-owned institutions
and companies, rose to 20.5 billion euros ($26.5 billion) from
19.5 billion euros a year earlier, according to preliminary
figures received by e-mail from the  Finance Ministry . The figure
came in below a target of 21 billion euros set in the 2012
budget, it said. Final figures are due later this month.  Ordinary budget revenue declined 3.1 percent in the first
11 months as Greece’s recession weighed on tax collection.
Spending rose 3 percent, or by 3.7 billion euros, boosted by a
20 percent increase in debt-servicing costs that added 2.6
billion euros to the bill, the Athens-based ministry said.  Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos ’s 2012 budget, approved on
Dec. 7, aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.4 percent of
gross domestic product from 9 percent this year. Efforts to trim
the shortfall have deepened the recession, now in its fourth
year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
expects the economy to contract 6.1 percent this year, more than
the 5.5 percent forecast in the government’s budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
