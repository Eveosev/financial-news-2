The death rate from malaria have
dropped more than 25 percent since 2000 as more insecticide-
coated nets and diagnostic tests were shipped to  Africa  and
other affected regions, the  World Health Organization  said.  The number of long-lasting nets delivered rose to 145
million last year from 88.5 million in 2009, the Geneva-based
United Nations health agency said today in a report on the
disease. About half of households in sub-Saharan Africa own at
least one bed net, the report said. Manufacturers shipped 88
million rapid diagnostic tests to affected regions in 2010,
almost double the 45 million sent in 2008, the WHO said.  “Worrisome signs suggest that progress might slow,” WHO
Director-General Margaret Chan wrote in a foreword to the
report, citing expected decreases in funding for malaria
prevention and treatment. More than $5 billion a year is needed
to meet goals for fighting the disease, and funds may have
peaked this year at $2 billion, according to Chan.  Malaria  is caused by a parasite transmitted through
mosquito bites. The parasite multiplies in the liver and infects
red blood cells. Left untreated, it can disrupt blood supply to
vital organs. There were 216 million malaria cases last year and
655,000 deaths, most of them in Africa, according to the WHO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
