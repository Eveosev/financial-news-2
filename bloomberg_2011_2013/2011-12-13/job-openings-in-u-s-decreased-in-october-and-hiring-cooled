The number of positions in the U.S.
waiting to be filled dropped in October, indicating a sustained
surge in the labor market may take time to develop, a government
report showed.  Openings  fell by 110,000 to 3.27 million, the Labor
Department said today in  Washington . Hiring also slowed by
110,000 from the prior month to 4.04 million, and firings eased.  Payrolls climbed by 120,000 workers in November after a
100,000 gain in October, and the  unemployment rate  fell to 8.6
percent, Labor Department figures showed on Dec. 2. Companies
may remain reluctant to expand their workforce as the threat
from  Europe ’s debt crisis and political gridlock in the U.S.
weighs on the outlook for the world’s largest economy.  “Businesses are not ready to take on a lot of workers as
demand is lackluster,”  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S. economist at
RBC Capital Markets Corp. in  New York , said before the report.
 “Growth just isn’t strong enough.”  Other reports today showed retail sales climbed in November
at the slowest pace in five months and companies boosted
inventories in October.  Purchases increased 0.2 percent after a 0.6 percent
advance in October that was more than initially reported,
Commerce Department figures showed. Economists projected a 0.6
percent November increase, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Inventories Climb  Stockpiles increased 0.8 percent, the most in five months,
other data from the agency showed.  Job openings  dropped 3.3 percent in October from a revised
3.38 million in the prior month that was more than previously
estimated, the report from the Labor Department showed.  The rate of job openings decreased to 2.4 percent from 2.5
percent in September. Professional and business services, which
include accountants and temporary-help agencies, showed the
biggest decrease in available employment.  The report helps shed light on the dynamics behind the
monthly employment figures. Payrolls advanced in November,
following revisions that added a total of 72,000 jobs to
payrolls in September and October, the Labor Department reported
earlier this month. Private employment rose by 140,000, it said.  Among companies expanding payrolls is  Boeing Co. (BA) , the
largest U.S. aircraft maker. The Chicago-based company is hiring
about 100 machinists a week as it boosts production by about 60
percent over three years to whittle down a backlog that now
stretches to nearly 4,000 aircraft.  Vying for Jobs  Compared with the 13.9 million Americans who were
unemployed in October, today’s figures indicate there were about
4 people vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the
recession began in December 2007.  Employers took on 4.04 million workers in October, down
from 4.15 million the previous month, today’s report showed.  Total firings, which exclude retirements and those who left
their job voluntarily, decreased to 1.6 million from 1.72
million a month before.  In the 12 months ended in October, the economy created a
net 1.3 million jobs, representing 48.1 million hires and about
46.8 million separations, today’s report showed.  American businesses are concerned the euro region may slide
into recession as European leaders struggle to solve the
sovereign debt crisis, causing a global slowdown that would also
limit U.S. growth.  In the U.S., politicians are clashing over proposals on a
 payroll tax  break set to end on Dec. 31. If Congress doesn’t
act, the two-percentage-point reduction in the payroll tax for
employees will expire at the end of this year, and workers will
pay 6.2 percent of their first $110,100, up from 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
