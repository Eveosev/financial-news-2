South Africa , which has the highest
unemployment rate of 61 countries tracked by Bloomberg, added
59,000  non-farm jobs  in the third quarter.  Employment in formal, non-agricultural industries rose 0.7
percent to 8.359 million from the second three months of the
year, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said on its website
today. The data is based on a survey of companies registered to
pay taxes.  South Africa’s economic growth stalled in the third
quarter, threatening a target to slash unemployment. Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  on Oct. 25 cut the government’s forecast
for growth to 3.1 percent in 2011 from a previous estimate of
3.4 percent, as the deepening debt crisis in  Europe  reduces
demand for exports. The region purchases about a third of South
Africa’s manufactured goods.  The  Reserve Bank  has kept the benchmark rate at a 30-year
low of 5.5 percent this year as it seeks to stimulate the
economy. South Africa’s GDP grew 1.4 percent in the third
quarter, little changed from an almost two-year low in the
previous previous three months.  The government says gross domestic product needs to expand
7 percent annually to meet a target to cut  unemployment  to 14
percent by 2020 from 25 percent.  Employment rose 2.5 percent, or 204,000 jobs, in the third
quarter from a year earlier, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
