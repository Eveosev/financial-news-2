Marubeni Corp. (8002)  and  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  of
Japan won an order to build a 55-megawatt geothermal plant from
Indonesia’s PT Geo Dipa Energi.  The plant, to be built in the suburbs of Bandung southeast
of Jakarta, will start operating in 2014, the companies said in
a statement today.  The order is worth about 6 billion yen ($77 million), Toru
Ohara, a Toshiba spokesman, said by phone. It’s the third
overseas geothermal project for Toshiba this year, after the
company won orders in New Zealand and Kenya.  To contact the reporters on this story:
