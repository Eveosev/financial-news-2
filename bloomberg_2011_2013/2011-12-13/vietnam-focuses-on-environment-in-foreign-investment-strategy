  Vietnam  will make environmental
protection a priority when considering future foreign direct
investment projects, said Nguyen The Phuong, deputy minister at
the Ministry of Planning and Investment.  “After 20 years calling for foreign investment, it’s now
time for us to choose projects which can bring us not just
economic benefits, but also help protect our environment,”
Phuong told reporters at a conference in Hanoi today. “We will
give priority to projects which come with green solutions, use
less natural resources such as coal, fuel, and electricity,”
Phuong said.  The ministry is working on a plan to attract foreign
investment in fields which would help develop green technology
in Vietnam, Phuong said, without elaborating.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
