Direct sales of tea to international
buyers has reduced the number of bidders at the centralized
Mombasa tea auction,  Business Daily  reported, citing Peter
Kimanga, the chairman of the East African Tea Trade Association.  Direct sales have resulted in a 30 percent decline in total
export volumes and there are concerns that this will undermine
pricing at the auction, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
