Treasuries  rose after the  Federal
Reserve  refrained from taking new actions to boost growth and
the refuge appeal of  U.S. debt  boosted demand to the highest
since April 2010 at today’s $21 billion 10-year note auction.  Yields on current 10-year notes reached a two-week low
after the sale’s  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount offered, reached 3.53, the
strongest level in 20 months. Concern than Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis is far from a resolution damped risk appetite.  “There is no Fed activity being priced in until 2013,”
said Bret Barker, a portfolio manager at Los Angeles-based TCW
Group Inc., which manages about $115 billion in assets. “The
strength of the 10-year auction has been the driver of price
action today.”  The  yield  on the current 10-year note dropped five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.97 percent at 5 p.m. in
 New York , according to BGCantor Market Data. It touched 1.95
percent, the lowest level since Nov. 25. Earlier the yields rose
to 2.06 percent. The 2 percent securities due in November 2021
climbed 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 10/32.
 Thirty-year bond  yields fell four basis points to 3.01 percent
and reached 2.98 percent, the lowest since Nov. 30.  Treasuries extended their advance as the euro slid to as
low as $1.3009, the weakest level since Jan. 12. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index of stocks fell 0.9 percent after rising earlier
as much as 1.1 percent.  Risk-Asset Weakness  “There’s general weakness in risk assets,” said Dan Mulholland, a trader in New York at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC
Capital Markets unit, one of the 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed. “The euro is putting pressure on stocks, and
subsequently we’re seeing a rally in Treasuries.”  The U.S. sold $35 billion in four-week bills at a rate of
zero percent, the same as at the previous offering on Dec. 6.
The bid-to-cover ratio was 7.47, the  second highest  since
Bloomberg data on the sales beginning in 2001. The record, 7.66,
was reached at last week’s sale.  The Fed said the economy in the U.S. is maintaining its
expansion even as the global economy slows.  “There was not much that was unexpected,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of  interest rates  at the primary dealer Cantor
Fitzgerald LP in New York. “There’s nothing new here.”  Today’s  Federal Open Market Committee  statement reiterated
the warning at the Fed’s two previous meetings that “Strains in
global financial markets continue to pose significant downside
risks to the economic outlook.”  ‘Exceptionally Low’  The Fed left unchanged its statement that economic
conditions are likely to warrant “exceptionally low” interest
rates “at least through mid-2013.” The central bank lowered
its  target interest rate  to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in
December 2008.  The central bank said it would continue its exchange of
$400 billion of short-term debt with long-term securities to
lengthen the average maturity of its holdings on its balance
sheet, an effort traders dubbed Operation Twist. The Fed bought
$2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of quantitative easing from
December 2008 to June 2011.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to a record low 1.72
percent on Sept. 22, the day after the central bank announced
the maturity-lengthening program.  Treasuries fell earlier today as  Europe ’s bailout fund sold
the maximum amount at its first auction of bills, reducing
refuge demand. They briefly pared declines after German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  rejected raising the upper limit of
funding for another rescue mechanism.  10-Year Auction  U.S. 10-year notes at today’s auction  yielded  2.020
percent, compared with a forecast of 2.050 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven primary dealers. The September
sale yielded a record low 2 percent.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 61.9 percent of the notes today,
compared with an average of 46.7 percent for the past 10
offerings. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that
place their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.4
percent, versus a 10-sale average of 10.1 percent.  “Clearly investors like Treasuries at these levels, given
continued concern about risk assets headed into the end of the
year as concern about a weakening Europe and economy remains,”
said  Scott Graham , head of government-bond trading at Bank of
Montreal’s BMO Capital Markets unit in  Chicago , a primary
dealer.  Debt Supply  The U.S. is selling $78 billion in notes, bonds and
inflation-indexed debt this week. It will auction $13 billion of
30-year debt tomorrow and $12 billion of five-year Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities on Dec 15. It sold $32 billion in
three-year notes yesterday to a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.62, a
record for the maturity.  The European Financial Stability Facility issued 1.97
billion euros ($2.6 billion) of 91-day bills at an average yield
of 0.2222 percent, the Bundesbank said. Investors bid for 3.2
times the amount sold, the German central bank said. The EFSF
sells debt to finance rescue loans extended to Europe’s high
debt and deficit nations.  Treasury yields stayed higher earlier after government data
showed U.S. retail sales rose 0.2 percent in November, the least
in five months. A Bloomberg survey forecast a 0.6 percent
increase. Recent reports have shown U.S. unemployment fell,
manufacturing picked up and  consumer confidence  climbed.  “The economy is still in a tenuous position,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams
Capital Group, a brokerage for institutional investors. “It
wouldn’t take too much to derail what’s happening.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
