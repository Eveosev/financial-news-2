Frank Schaeffler , an FDP lawmaker on
the German parliament’s finance committee, demanded a referendum
on euro rescue plans, according to an article he wrote in
 Handelsblatt .  The people should have the possibility to intervene in
decision making, Schaeffler said; should debt and transfer
policies continue, prosperity will suffer and eventually hurt
all Europeans, Schaeffler wrote in Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
