Peru ’s central bank made its second-
biggest dollar purchase this year to slow gains in the sol as
optimism Europe may stem its debt crisis spurred demand for
emerging-market assets.  The central bank bought $211 million in the spot market
today and paid an average 2.6950 soles per  U.S. dollar , it said
on its website. The bank’s  purchases  total $1.06 billion so far
this month.  The sol rose 0.3 percent to 2.6945 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, from 2.7015 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit.  Global stocks and commodities rallied earlier today after
German investor confidence unexpectedly increased and Spain sold
more debt than planned at an auction. The sol fell 0.2 percent
yesterday after President  Ollanta Humala  swore in 10 new cabinet
ministers on Dec. 11 in the wake of mining protests.  “Positive news abroad today is pushing the cabinet changes
into the background,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at
 Banco Santander  in Lima.  The sol will likely continue its advance this month as
companies seek the local currency to make year-end bonus and tax
payments, Navarro said.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 was little changed at 5.75 percent,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price
eased 0.02 centimo to 114.08 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporters on this story:
