     Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) --Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al Jaber Al-Sabah approved a new government formed by Prime
Minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah, the state-run KUNA
news agency reported.  The ministers of oil, finance, foreign affairs, commerce,
interior and defense in the new 11-member Cabinet remain the
same, KUNA reported, citing an Emiri decree.  Sheikh Sabah dissolved parliament on Dec. 6 and said
elections should be held, after a dispute over corruption
allegations sparked anti-government protests unprecedented in
the Persian Gulf state. New elections, according the
constitution, must be held within 60 days of the dissolution of
parliament.  Parliament was dissolved after the Cabinet, headed by
Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Sabah, resigned following months of
protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
