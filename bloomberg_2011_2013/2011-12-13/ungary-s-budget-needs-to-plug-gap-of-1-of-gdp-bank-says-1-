Hungary ’s Cabinet, which is
overhauling its 2012 budget after cutting its growth and forint
forecast, needs to trim the deficit by about 1 percent of gross
domestic product to meet its target, the central bank said.  The 2012 shortfall may be between 3.4 percent and 3.6
percent of GDP, compared with the Cabinet’s 2.5 percent target,
the Budapest-based bank said in a report today. The forecast
takes into account the development of bond yields, the currency
and macroeconomic trends, the report said.  Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  last week cut the
country’s growth forecast to ’’at most’’ 0.5 percent from 1.5
percent, citing slower expansion in western  Europe , Hungary’s
biggest export market. The country faces a shortfall of about
200 billion forint ($867 million) as a result, Economy State
Secretary Zoltan Csefalvay said yesterday.  The government can narrow the budget gap to within 3
percent of GDP next year by scrapping its budget reserves,
according to the report. Keeping the reserves intact and meeting
the Cabinet’s 2.5 percent goal would require an adjustment of
about 1 percent of GDP, the bank said.  The forint strengthened 1 percent to 303.26 per euro as of
4:06 p.m. in Budapest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
