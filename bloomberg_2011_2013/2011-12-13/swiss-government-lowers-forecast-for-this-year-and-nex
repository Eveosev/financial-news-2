The Swiss government lowered its
growth forecasts for this year and next, saying the economy will
recover in 2013.  Swiss  gross domestic product  will rise 1.8 percent this
year and 0.5 percent in 2012, the State Secretariat for Economic
Affairs in Bern said in an e-mailed  statement  today. In
September, it had forecast the economy to expand 1.9 percent and
0.9 percent this year and next, respectively. In 2013, the
economy will gain traction again and expand 1.9 percent, the
government said.  Switzerland ’s economy is showing signs of a slowdown as the
franc’s appreciation is making exports more expensive, curbing
demand just as the global economy is weakening. The  KOF leading
indicator  fell to the lowest in two years in November and Jona,
Switzerland-based Holcim Ltd., the world’s second-largest cement
maker, last month said the franc’s appreciation reduced third-
quarter sales and operating profit by 15 percent.  Swiss exports may rise 3.4 percent this year, the
government said in its statement. That’s 0.2 percentage points
more than forecast in September. In 2012, exports will gain 0.4
percent, the government added. In September, it forecast 0.7
percent of foreign sales growth.  Exports will climb 4.4 percent in 2013, the state
secretariat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
