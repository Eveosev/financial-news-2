Fitch Ratings  said it revised its
outlook on the  Czech Republic  to stable from positive and
reaffirmed the country’s A+ assessment.  “The revision of the Czech Republic’s outlook to stable
largely reflects the deterioration of the growth outlook and
heightened financial stress in the eurozone, which is the Czech
Republic’s main trading partner by far,” Michele Napolitano,
Associate Director in Fitch’s Emerging Europe Sovereigns
team in  London , said in a statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
