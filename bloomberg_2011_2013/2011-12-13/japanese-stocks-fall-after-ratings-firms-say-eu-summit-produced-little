     Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average paring yesterday’s gains, after ratings
companies said last week’s European summit did little to resolve
the debt crisis that has roiled markets this year.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
fell 2.6 percent.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co (6305) , a Japanese
machinery maker that counts  China  as the biggest market, slid
2.6 percent after Chinese housing sales dropped. Chip-related
companies including  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035)  slid after bellwether
 Intel Corp . cut its sales forecast. Olympus Corp. rose for a
third day on speculation the scandal-hit company won’t be
delisted.  The Nikkei 225 declined 1.2 percent to 8,552.81 as of the 3
p.m. close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix index lost 0.8 percent to
740.71. The broader gauge has all but wiped out yesterday’s
gains as investors assess the impact of  Europe ’s fifth major
agreement in 19 months aimed at ending the crisis.  “Nothing new came of last week’s European summit,” said
 Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co. “If EU nations get downgraded, funding costs in
the region will definitely rise.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 1.5 percent yesterday
in  New York  after Moody’s Investors Service said the latest
European summit didn’t produce “decisive” measures to end the
crisis.  Fitch Ratings  said the summit did little to ease
pressure on Europe’s sovereign bond ratings. Futures on the  S&P
500 index  were little changed today.  ‘Negative News Flows’  “The market is pricing in possible downgrades to a degree,
but people have a sense that this will not lead to a financial
crisis,” saidKazuyuki Terao, chief Investment Officer of RCM
Japan Co.  Exporters of cars and electronics contributed the most to
the Topix’s decline. Sony fell 2.6 percent to 1,386 yen. Honda
Motor Co., Japan’s second-biggest automaker by market value,
dropped 2.9 percent 2,384 yen.  In China, housing transactions declined in 27 out of 35
cities tracked by Soufun Holdings Ltd. during the week of Dec.
5-11, with 13 cities seeing a drop of more than 50 percent.
Transactions fell more than 60 percent in at least 4 cities,
including Tianjin and Hangzhou, according to the operator of the
nation’s biggest real-estate website.  Hitachi Construction fell 2.6 percent to 1,370 yen.  Komatsu
Ltd. (6301) , Japan’s largest construction machinery maker that gets 23
percent of its sales in China, lost 1.9 percent to 1,962 yen.  Topix Performance  Japanese companies this year have had share prices hit by
more than Europe’s crisis. The yen’s rise to a postwar high
against the dollar and disruptions to production from floods in
 Thailand  and the country’s worst earthquake on record have sent
the Topix down about 18 percent since January, compared with a
14 percent decline on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Japan’s largest company by sales, last
week cut its full-year profit forecast by more than half, citing
damage to factories in Thailand. Toyota’s shares have dropped 20
percent in 2011 and production cuts have jeopardized the
company’s position as the world’s top carmaker.  “Investors appreciate a quick rebound in supply chains
despite a lot of hardships,” said Kenji Sekiguchi, general
manager at Mitsubishi　UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees
the equivalent of $75　billion. “The market’s focus will be on
domestic demand and global economic slowdowns. People are
focusing on reconstruction efforts.”  The March disaster in some parts has decided winners and
losers this year.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , the utility at the
center of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, has been
the worst performer in the Topix index, losing 88 percent.
Nissei Build Kogyo Co., a homebuilder benefiting from
reconstruction efforts, has jumped to 211 yen from 52 yen at the
end of 2010, becoming the biggest winner on the gauge.  Chip Shares Fall  Japanese manufacturers of semiconductors and chipmaking
equipment dropped today after Intel, the world’s largest
chipmaker, slashed its sales forecast. The  Santa Clara ,
California-based company said flooding in Thailand had caused a
shortage of hard-disk drives that is forcing computer companies
to cut production.  Tokyo Electron, Japan’s biggest manufacturer of chipmaking
gear, fell 1.3 percent to 4,115 yen.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , a maker of
memory-chip testers, slid 2.6 percent to 800 yen.  Renesas
Electronics Corp. (6723) , the world’s largest producer of
microcontrollers used in cars, dropped 3 percent to 523 yen.  Olympus rose for a third day amid speculation it will meet
a deadline for reporting earnings tomorrow. The company said
yesterday it plans to release its second-quarter earnings by
Dec. 14. Tokyo Stock Exchange rules require the company to be
delisted if it misses the deadline.  Shares of the optical equipment maker advanced 5.4 percent
to 1,370 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
