Shares of the following companies
had  unusual (JCI)  moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The Jakarta Composite index fell 0.8 percent to 3,763.58,
the most since Nov. 25.  PT Citra Marga Nusaphala (CMNP)  , a toll-road operator,
jumped 7.6 percent to 1,710 rupiah, the steepest increase since
Sept. 27. The shares gained on speculation parliament will
approve this week a land acquisition bill that will accelerate
toll-road projects, said Adrianus Bias Prasuryo, an analyst at
Jakarta-based PT Samuel Sekuritas Indonesia.  PT International Nickel Indonesia (INCO)  , the nation’s
largest producer of the metal, declined 2.4 percent to 3,100
rupiah, the biggest loss since Nov. 25. Nickel futures dropped
as much as 1.9 percent to $18,092 a metric ton in  London .  PT Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC)  , Indonesia’s
biggest listed oil company, fell 2 percent to 2,425 rupiah.
Crude oil futures in  New York  fell to a two-week low yesterday,
dropping 1.7 percent to $97.77 a barrel. Oil last traded at
$98.15 a barrel in after-hours trading.  PT Media Nusantara Citra (MNCN)  , a media company, sank
5.2 percent to 1,290 rupiah, the most since Sept. 22. An
“undisclosed shareholder” sold 350 million of the company’s
shares at 1,270 rupiah apiece, said Richard Taylor, Hong Kong-
based senior managing director at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets,
which helped arranged the sale. That’s below yesterday’s closing
price of 1,360 rupiah.  PT Renuka Coalindo (SQMI)  , a coal producer, jumped 25
percent to 455 rupiah. The stock extended yesterday’s 24 percent
jump after the company said Dec. 9 it expects coal output at its
PT Jambi Prima Coal unit to rise to at least 1 million metric
tons next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
