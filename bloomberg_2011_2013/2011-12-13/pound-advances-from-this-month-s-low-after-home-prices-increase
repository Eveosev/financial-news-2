The pound strengthened to a nine-
month high against the euro as concern the region’s debt crisis
will worsen boosted demand for the relative safety of the U.K.
currency.  Sterling reversed a gain versus the dollar and gilts pared
a decline. Fitch Ratings yesterday joined Moody’s Investors
Service and Standard & Poor’s in warning it may cut the credit
ratings of euro-area nations.  The pound climbed 0.5 percent to 84.19 pence per euro at
4:06 p.m. London time, the strongest since Feb. 22. It fell 0.4
percent to $1.5515 after climbing 0.3 percent.  A gauge of  housing  compiled by the  Royal Institution  of
Chartered Surveyors rose to minus 17 percentage points from
minus 24 points in October, the group said by e-mail today.  Ten-year gilt yields climbed four basis points to 2.14
percent, while two-year yields added two basis points to 0.38
percent.  The FTSE 100 index of shares jumped 1.1 percent and the
Stoxx 600 rose 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
