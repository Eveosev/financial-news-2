Hungary  should raise the banking
system’s capital adequacy ratio from 8 percent to ease the
threat of further credit downgrades and help talks with
creditors, Karoly Szasz, the head of the financial market
regulator  Pszaf , told state news agency MTI.  “We must not wait until a potential new credit downgrade
or for the  International Monetary Fund  to request us to do so,”
Szasz said in an interview published today. “We must be
proactive and the stability of the system requires it as well.”  Hungary, which had its  credit rating  cut to junk at Moody’s
Investors Service last month, has asked the IMF for a
“financial safety net” as it seeks to avoid recession next
year. The IMF package may be between 15 billion euros ($19.8
billion) to 20 billion euros,  Mihaly Varga , chief of staff for
Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , said in an interview with the  Origo 
news website today.  Hungary’s financial system, though stable, has “reached
the limit of its ability to withstand risks and burdens and is
showing a rising number of cracks,” Szasz said. The European
debt crisis and domestic measures, including a special tax on
banks and a mortgage repayment plan forcing banks to book losses
on such products, has taken a toll on banks’ capital and
profitability, according to Szasz.  The watchdog is proposing an increase in the Tier 1 ratio
of certain banks that reach a regulatory size limit and lenders
would have to come up with the extra capital in 2012, Szasz
said. Pszaf has sent the proposal to the Economy Ministry for
approval, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
