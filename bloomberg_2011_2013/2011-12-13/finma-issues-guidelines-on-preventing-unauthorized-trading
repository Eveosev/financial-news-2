The Swiss Financial Market
Supervisory Authority said it expects banks to provide a
“robust” framework measuring and controlling trading risks to
prevent losses from unauthorized transactions as seen at  UBS AG. (UBSN)   The watchdog, known as Finma, said it will check
“selectively” if and how institutions fulfill  guidelines  it
issued today on the application of its rules to prevent
unauthorized trading, according to a statement on the Bern,
Switzerland-based regulator’s website.  UBS,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, reported a $2.3 billion
trading loss in September after “unauthorized or unexplained”
activity that the bank’s internal systems detected wasn’t
“sufficiently” probed and controls weren’t enforced, Chief
Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti  told employees in October.  “Operational risks for banks active in trading are
substantial and often relate to unauthorized trading,”
according to the statement from the Swiss markets watchdog.
“Such risks can rapidly result in significant losses, as recent
events caused by unauthorized trading activity at UBS in  London 
have shown.”  Banks’ senior management should appropriately prioritize
the risks associated with unauthorized trading while “a balance
must be struck between profitability and risk when determining
annual goals,” Finma said. Control systems must be given
priority, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
