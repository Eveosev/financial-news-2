Brown University Athletic Director
 Michael Goldberger  will retire at the end of the academic year,
the school said in a statement.  Goldberger, 61, joined the Providence, Rhode Island-based
university in 1973 as an assistant football coach. He later
coached freshman football, was an assistant baseball coach, a
facilities director and the director of the school’s admissions
office for 10 years before being named athletic director in July
2005.  During Goldberger’s tenure as  athletic director , Brown won
12 Ivy League championships and made 14 National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament appearances in sports including
soccer. The women’s crew team won the Division I rowing
championships in 2007, 2008 and 2011, and the football team won
the Ivy League championship in 2005 and 2008.  “I am fortunate to have been able to have three different
careers -- coaching, admission and athletic administration --all
at a university that I love,” Goldberger said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
