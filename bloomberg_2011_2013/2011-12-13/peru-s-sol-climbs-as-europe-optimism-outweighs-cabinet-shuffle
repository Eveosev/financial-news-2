Peru ’s sol climbed the most in two
weeks as concern about Europe’s debt crisis waned, spurring
demand for emerging-market assets.  The sol rose 0.2 percent to 2.696 per  U.S. dollar  at 10:39
a.m. in Lima, from 2.7015 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit.  Global stocks and commodities rallied today after German
investor confidence unexpectedly increased and Spain sold more
debt than planned at an auction. The currency snapped an eight-
day rally yesterday as President  Ollanta Humala  swore in 10 new
cabinet ministers in the wake of mining protests.  “Positive news abroad today is pushing the cabinet changes
into the background,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at
 Banco Santander  in Lima.  The sol will likely continue its advance this month as
companies seek the local currency to make year-end bonus and tax
‘payments, Navarro said.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 was little changed at 5.75 percent,
according to pricing from Citibank Peru. The bond’s price held
at 114.10 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
