Canada’s dollar dropped to its
weakest level this month after the  Federal Reserve  supported the
U.S. currency by refraining from taking new action to lower
borrowing costs.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known, fell earlier
after German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said a cap on the European
Stability Mechanism will stay in place. Canadian government 10-
year bonds rose after the Fed’s statement.  “The absence of the hint that they might loosen further in
the future creates a very small, knee-jerk U.S. dollar-positive
reaction,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at
Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.  The loonie depreciated 0.7 percent to C$1.0343 per U.S.
dollar at 5 p.m. Toronto time after reaching C$1.0349, its
weakest since Nov. 30. One Canadian dollar buys 96.68 U.S.
cents. The Canadian currency rose 0.5 percent to C$1.3477
against the euro.  Canadian 10-year bond yields fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.97 percent. The 3.25 percent
securities maturing in June 2021 increased 30 cents to C$110.96.  Fed policy makers said the  U.S. economy  is maintaining its
expansion even as the global economy slows. The central bank
left unchanged its statement that economic conditions are likely
to warrant “exceptionally low”  interest rates  “at least
through mid-2013.” The U.S. is Canada’s biggest trading
partner.  The U.S. central bank lowered its target rate for overnight
lending between banks to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in
December 2008.  Stock Markets  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  slid 0.9 percent after
earlier rising 1.1 percent. The S&P/TSX Composite Index,
Canada’s equity benchmark, decreased 1.2 percent.  U.S. retail sales rose 0.2 percent in November and were
revised to 0.6 percent higher in the previous month, from 0.5
percent, the Commerce Department reported today.  During a meeting of  Germany ’s Christian Democratic caucus
in Berlin, Merkel confirmed the 500 billion-euro ($656 billion)
limit on the European Stability Mechanism as agreed to by
European Union leaders at a summit last week, two officials said
on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
