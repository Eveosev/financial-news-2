The  Los Angeles Kings  fired coach
Terry Murray after a four-game National Hockey League losing
streak.  Assistant coach John Stevens will take charge on an interim
basis, team President and General Manager Dean Lombardi said in
a  statement  on the Kings’ website today.  Murray, 61, had a 139-106-30 record since taking over as
the Kings’ coach during the 2008-09 season. He reached the 100-
win mark faster than any coach in team history and helped the
Kings reach the NHL playoffs the previous two seasons.  The Kings’ recent slide has left them 13-12-4 and in fourth
place in the Western Conference’s five-team Pacific Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
