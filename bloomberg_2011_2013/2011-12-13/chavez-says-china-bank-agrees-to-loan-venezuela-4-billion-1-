Venezuela’s President  Hugo Chavez 
said a Chinese bank agreed to loan Venezuela $4 billion that
will be used for housing construction.  Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez signed the agreement during a
recent trip to Beijing, Chavez said today on state television.
Chavez, who in June underwent surgery to remove a cancerous
tumor, last week cited needing to attend to an emergency caused
by heavy rains for canceling visits to Argentina and  Brazil  in
what would have been his first official trip since announcing he
had cancer.  “Yesterday in Beijing an agreement was reached for a new
loan of $4 billion from another Chinese bank for Venezuela,
mostly to build housing,” Chavez said in comments broadcast on
state television. The president has made solving Venezuela’s
housing deficit of more than 2 million homes a cornerstone of
his campaign for re-election next year.  Venezuela currently sends  China  about 400,000 barrels of
oil a day to repay about $32 billion in loans negotiated through
the  China Development Bank . Chavez has said that forming
strategic alliances with countries such as China and  Russia  is
critical to his attempts to foil what he calls U.S. hegemony in
the region.  Heavy transport aircraft purchased from China will arrive
in Venezuela soon, Chavez said today. The former paratrooper
said he was obliged to turn to China after the U.S. blocked him
from obtaining spare parts for the country’s fleet of Hercules
planes.  The U.S. in May 2006 ended all commercial arms sales to
Venezuela, saying the country hadn’t done enough to fight
terrorism, and has urged other countries to do the same.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
