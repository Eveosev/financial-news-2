More than 100 Chinese fisherman
filed a lawsuit against ConocoPhillip’s  China  unit seeking 490
million yuan ($77 million) in compensation after an  oil spill  in
June, the official Xinhua news agency reported.  The 107 fishermen from Hebei province filed their lawsuit
in a maritime court in Tianjin city today, claiming that the oil
spill in Bohai Bay killed their clams and sea cucumbers. Xinhua
cited Zhao Jingwei, a lawyer with Beijing-based Yingke Law Firm,
who is representing the fishermen.  The fishermen must wait seven days for the court to decide
if it will accept the case, Xinhua said.  “ConocoPhillips has not been notified of a lawsuit,” John McLemore, the company spokesman, said in an e-mail today.  China ordered  ConocoPhillips (COP) , operator of Penglai 19-3, to
stop production at the country’s biggest offshore field on Sept.
2, saying the Houston-based company failed to contain leaks at
the field since June. The oil spill has polluted more than 6,200
square kilometers of water in the bay, an area about nine times
the size of Singapore, according to the Xinhua report.  The  International Energy Agency  in September cut its
outlook for China’s 2011 oil production by 1.2 percent to 4.2
million barrels a day because of the closure.  --Jing Yang. Editor: Mike Anderson,  To contact the reporter on this story:
