Crude oil inventories rose 462,000
barrels to 334.6 million last week, the  American Petroleum
Institute  said.  Distillate fuel inventories  increased 1.24 million barrels
to 142.4 million, the APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Gasoline
stockpiles  slipped 12,000 barrels to 215.3 million.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, gained
94,000 barrels to 31.2 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil fell
2.5 million barrels last week, according to the median of 12
responses in a  Bloomberg News  survey. Gasoline inventories
probably advanced 1.2 million barrels, and distillate
inventories probably rose 1 million barrels, the survey showed.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for January delivery rose $2.27 to $100.04 a
barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract, which settled at $100.14,
traded at $99.96 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
