Church & Dwight Co. (CHD)  must turn over
sales data sought by U.S. regulators probing retailer discounts
the company used to secure shelf space for Trojan brand condoms,
an appeals court ruled.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in  Washington  today turned down
the company’s challenge to a subpoena from the Federal Trade
Commission, ruling the agency should get information on Church &
Dwight’s sales of other products, too, such as cat litter and
toothpaste, so it can determine whether the company is using
monopolistic practices.  Church & Dwight, the leading manufacturer of condoms in the
U.S., argued that information on non-condom products wasn’t
“reasonably relevant” to the FTC probe in part because the
agency resolution authorizing the investigation in June 2009
didn’t explicitly request such data. Other brands made by
Princeton, New Jersey-based Church & Dwight include Arm &
Hammer, First Response, Nair and Orajel.  “The resolution lawfully encompasses an investigation into
whether Church & Dwight has bundled discounts for condoms and
other products in order to acquire or maintain a monopoly in the
market for condoms in the  United States ,” Judge Douglas
Ginsburg wrote in the opinion.  Church & Dwight’s marketing services department  didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the
ruling.  The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Church & Dwight
Co., 10-5383, U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
