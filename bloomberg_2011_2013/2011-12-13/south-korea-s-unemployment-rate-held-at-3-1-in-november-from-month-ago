South  Korea ’s unemployment rate held
at a three-year low last month as  service industries  hired more
workers to meet growing demand.  The  jobless rate  stood at 3.1 percent in November,
unchanged from October, Statistics Korea said today in Gwacheon,
south of Seoul. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
of 10 economists was for a rate of 3.2 percent.  South Korea ’s job market is showing resilience even as the
deepening debt crisis in Europe and slowing global growth
threaten to cool an economy that has grown for 11 straight
quarters. Industrial production unexpectedly  fell  in October
while department store sales also dropped.  “Labor market conditions will likely worsen due to rising
uncertainties in Europe,” Lee Sung Kwon, an economist at
Shinhan Investment Corp. in  Seoul , said before the release.
“The central bank and government may try to support growth with
lower  interest rates  and more fiscal spending.”  The won declined 0.6 percent to close at 1,153.99 per
dollar as of 3 p.m. in Seoul yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark Kospi stock index slid 1.9
percent.  Growth Cut  Amid signs of a slowdown, the  Bank of Korea  last week kept
borrowing costs unchanged at 3.25 percent for a sixth month, the
longest pause since tightening began in July 2010.  The central bank last week cut its growth forecast for next
year to 3.7 percent from 4.6 percent estimated in July, compared
with a 3.8 percent gain this year.  The government projected the same growth on Dec. 12, with
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan hinting that an extra budget may
be needed in case of a sharp economic slowdown or downturn
because of  Europe . About 280,000 jobs are expected to be created
next year, compared with 400,000 jobs this year, according to
the Finance Ministry.  The seasonally unadjusted jobless rate stood at 2.9 percent
in November, unchanged from October, today’s report showed. The
number of employed people increased by 479,000, or 2 percent, to
24.589 million last month from a year earlier.  Employment in manufacturing fell 2.1 percent from a year
earlier, while the number of people self-employed or working in
government jobs increased 3.1 percent.  The number employed in the electricity, transportation,
telecommunication and finance industries rose 5.7 percent, while
jobs in the agricultural, fishery and forestry industries
declined 0.7 percent.  The health and welfare service sector added 113,000 jobs.
Wholesalers and retailers added 109,000 jobs in November from a
year ago, the data showed.  The government plans to create more jobs in the public
sector to support the job market as the expected economic
slowdown damps hiring at private companies.  State-run firms and agencies will recruit 14,450 workers
next year, 40 percent higher than this year’s hiring, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
