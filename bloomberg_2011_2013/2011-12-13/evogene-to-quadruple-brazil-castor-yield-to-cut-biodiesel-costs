Evogene Ltd. (EVGN) , the Israeli
biotechnology company, is seeking to quadruple the yield of
castor beans it grows in Brazil to cut the cost of producing
biodiesel.  The company expects to produce 4 metric tons of castor a
hectare annually by 2013, said Liat Cinamon, director of
 investor relations .  The global average is about 1 ton, she said today in a
telephone interview from Israel, citing  production data  from the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the  United Nations .  Evogene, based in Rehovot, Israel, said yesterday it’s
expanding a field trial it began last year with local
agribusiness  SLC Agricola SA (SLCE3)  to breed castor plants in northeast
Brazil that bear more seeds and grow more densely.  “This will significantly cut the cost of biodiesel
feedstock,” which accounts for 80 percent of production costs,
she said.  Castor oil, which can also be used in paints, lubricants
and chemicals industries, sells for about $2,000 a ton, compared
to $1,500 for  soybean oil , Cinamon said.  “When Evogene meets its target it will be competitive”
with other biodiesel raw materials such as soybean oil, which is
the staple feedstock for most Brazilian refineries, she said.  About 79 percent of biodiesel feedstock was soybean oil in
September and none was made from castor oil, according to data
posted  online by  fuel regulator Agencia Nacional do Petroleo,
Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
