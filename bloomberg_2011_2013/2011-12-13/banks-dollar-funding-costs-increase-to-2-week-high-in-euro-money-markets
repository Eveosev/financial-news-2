The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars rose to the highest in two weeks, according to
money-market indicators.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, was 128 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:13 a.m. in  London . It
has widened by 19 basis points since Dec. 8, when  Europe ’s
leaders met in Brussels to address the region’s debt crisis.  The one-year basis swap was at 90 basis points under
Euribor from minus 89 basis points yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
Europe rose. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was at 95.5 basis
points from 94.6 yesterday.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank , placing 346 billion euros ($457 billion) at the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, from 335 billion euros on Dec. 9.
That’s the most since June 2010 and compares with a year-to-date
weekly average of 89 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
