Following is the text of the monthly
retail sales report from the Commerce Department.  NOVEMBER 2011  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance
estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for November,
adjusted for seasonal variation and holiday and trading-day
differences, but not for price changes, were $399.3 billion, an
increase of 0.2 percent (+/-0.5%)* from the previous month and
6.7 percent (+/-0.7%) above November 2010. Total sales for the
September through November 2011 period were up 7.4 percent (+/-
0.5%) from the same period a year ago.  Retail trade sales were up 0.3 percent (+/-0.5%)* from
October 2011, and 6.8 percent (+/-0.7%) above last year.
Nonstore retailers sales were up 13.9 percent (+/-2.3%) from
November 2010 and gasoline stations sales were up 12.9 percent
(+/-1.7%) from last year.  The scheduled release dates for 2012 are as follows:
January 12, February 14, March 13, April 16, May 15, June 13,
July 16, August 14, September 14, October 15, November 14,
December 13.  The advance estimates are based on a subsample of the
Census Bureau's full retail and food services sample. A
stratified random sampling method is used to select
approximately 5,000 retail and food services firms whose sales
are then weighted and benchmarked to represent the complete
universe of over three million retail and food services firms.
Responding firms account for approximately 65% of the MARTS
dollar volume estimate. For an explanation of the measures of
sampling variability included in this report, please see the
Reliability of Estimates section on the last page of this
publication.  The Advance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services for
December is scheduled to be released January 12, 2012 at 8:30
a.m. EST.  For customized retail time series estimates by industry,

Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude
that the actual change is different than zero.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department
