Drake & Scull International PJSC (DSI) 
jumped to the highest in almost three months after the Dubai-
based construction company said a unit won a contract valued at
142 million dirhams ($39 million) in  Egypt .  The shares jumped 2.2 percent to 85.4 fils, the highest
price since Sept. 21, at the 1 p.m. close in Dubai.  The contract is for building a mining-grade ammonium
nitrate plant at the province of Ain Sukhna in Egypt, the
company said today. The contract brings Drake & Scullâ€™s project
wins to 618 million dirhams in Egypt this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
