U.S. stocks pared early gains and
the euro slid to the lowest level versus the dollar since
January following a report that German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
is rejecting an increase in the upper limit of funding for
Europe’s permanent bailout mechanism.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to
1,239.73 at 10:48 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 1.1
percent. The euro weakened as much as 0.7 percent to $1.3100 as
it fell against 13 of 16 major peers.  Stocks and the euro turned lower as Reuters reported that
Merkel has rejected raising the upper limit of funding for the
European Stability Mechanism. Earlier gains in equities came
after German investor confidence improved and Spain sold more
debt than planned at an auction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
