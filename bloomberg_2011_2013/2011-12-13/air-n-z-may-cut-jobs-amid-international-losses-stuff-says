Air New Zealand Ltd. (AIR)  may cut jobs
early in 2012 to trim losses of about NZ$1 million ($762,000) a
week on international routes, stuff.co.nz reported without
saying where it got the information.  The job losses at the carrier’s Auckland head office and in
the U.K. and U.S. may be in the “low hundreds” and won’t
affect services to  London , the website said today.  The suggestion of job cuts is “pure speculation,”
Brigitte Ransom, a spokeswoman for the airline, said by e-mail
today. The company is conducting a review of operations to
improve performance on the London route, she said.  Air New Zealand, which is 73 percent owned by the
government, is constrained by its small domestic population and
the large distances between  New Zealand  and major international
markets, Nomura analyst David Fraser wrote in a Sept. 7 note.
The company’s scheduled service from Auckland to London takes 25
hours and travels more than 11,000 miles.  The nation’s largest carrier is targeting a NZ$110 million
increase in international earnings by June 30, 2015, the company
said in a Nov. 25 presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
