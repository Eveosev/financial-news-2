Coffee output at the Cooparaiso
cooperative in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, will fall
4.7 percent in the season starting July 1 from the previous
peak-yield period in the biennial crop cycle.  Production will drop to 3.15 million bags from 3.31 million
bags, Marcelo Almeida, a technical director at  Cooparaiso , said
today in a telephone interview from Sao Sebastiao do Paraiso in
the state of  Minas Gerais .  The crop will fall 10 percent in the Mogiana region in the
state of  Sao Paulo  and by 3.6 percent in the South of Minas area
in Minas Gerais, partly because of dry weather, Alemida said.  Minas Gerais is the nation’s largest arabica-producing
state. The beans are brewed by specialty companies including
Starbucks Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
