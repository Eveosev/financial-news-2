U.K. store visits fell last week as
severe winds and flooding restricted holiday shopping trips in
 Scotland  and northern England, researcher  Experian Plc (EXPN)  said.  Visits to stores and malls declined 2.5 percent in the week
beginning Dec. 5 compared with a year earlier, Experian said in
an e-mailed statement today. Shopper visits slumped 30 percent
in Scotland on Dec. 8, when flooding disrupted transport.  Visits to retail parks, or out-of-town centers, rose 0.4
percent from a year earlier, though were down 2.2 percent on the
previous week, Experian said. Cash-strapped Britons may wait
until the “final few days” before Christmas to shop as they
seek out last-minute bargains, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
