Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for
the first trading session in three after the central bank said
funding allocated from the  International Monetary Fund  will
stabilize the currency.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.1 percent to 89.40 per dollar and was trading less
than 0.1 percent higher at 89.46 per dollar at 11:27 a.m. in
Nairobi.  The IMF executive board completed the second review of
Kenya under the Extended Credit Facility and approved
“immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to $143.7
million,” the board  announced  on Dec 9. Yesterday was a public
holiday.  “It’s going to support us in the policy effort that we
have to stabilize the  exchange rate ,” central bank Governor
Njuguna Ndung’u told reporters in the capital, Nairobi, today.
“We believe that we will win the war against inflation.”  Uganda ’s currency strengthened for the second day, reaching
the highest in almost six months, on increased dollar inflows
from Ugandans living abroad and reduced dollar demand by
businesses preparing for the end of year.  The shilling gained 0.3 percent to 2,443 per dollar, the
highest since June 20.  “The shilling has gained because of dollar inflows from
Ugandans living abroad amid low demand in the market as
businesses wind down their operations for the year,” Walter
Mananu, a currency trader at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd. said by
phone from Kampala.  The Tanzania shilling gained for the fourth day, rising
less than 0.1 percent to 1,612.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
