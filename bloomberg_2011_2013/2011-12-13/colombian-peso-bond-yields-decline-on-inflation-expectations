Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities lower, after a central bank
survey showed year-end inflation expectations remained little
changed.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.59
percent, according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.139 centavo to 119.088 centavos per peso.  Economists predict inflation will end this year at 3.64
percent, according to the median forecast in the central bank
survey published yesterday. That compares to 3.62 percent in
last month’s survey. Annual inflation quickened to 4.02 percent
in October, breaching the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent
target range for the first time since April 2009, before slowing
to 3.96 in November.  “This is good news because it shows that last month’s rate
hike helped anchor inflation expectations,” said Francisco Chaves, an analyst at brokerage Corredores Asociados SA in
Bogota.  Banco de la Republica raised the overnight lending rate by
25 basis points to 4.75 percent on Nov. 25, making Colombia the
only country in  Latin America  to increase rates in the past four
months.  The Colombian peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 1,929.55 per
 U.S. dollar , from 1,931.39 yesterday. The currency has slipped 1
percent in the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
