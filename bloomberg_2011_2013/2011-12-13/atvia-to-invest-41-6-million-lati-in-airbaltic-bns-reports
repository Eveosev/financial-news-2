Latvia’s government agreed to invest
41.6 million lati ($78.8 million) in unprofitable state-owned
airline AirBaltic AS’s capital, the  Baltic News Service 
reported, citing a Transport Ministry official.  The increase would follow an investment of 16 million lati
the state made in October, and would need to be approved by
Parliament, said Anrijs Matiss, the Transport Ministry’s state
secretary, the newswire reported.  Should the minority shareholder, Baltic Aviation Systems,
be unable to invest in the capital, another 25.4 million-lati
loan would be given to the airline from the state treasury,
Matiss said, BNS reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
