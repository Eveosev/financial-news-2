Ethanol futures faltered for a third
day in  Chicago  amid record production and ample inventories.  Futures have fallen 3.2 percent since a Dec. 7 Energy
Department report showed  ethanol production  at a record 954,000
barrels a day in the week ended Dec. 2 and  stockpiles  at 17.9
million barrels, the highest since Aug. 19.  “There’s a lot of sellers right now and not a lot of
buyers,” said Jim Damask, a manager at BiofuelsConnect, a
Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy broker. “There’s
plenty of material to be bought.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 0.3 cent to
$2.111 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price
since Dec. 10, 2010. Futures have fallen 11 percent this year,
heading for the first yearly decline since 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped
7.5 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.375 a gallon and on the West
Coast the additive decreased 5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.40,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  increased 3 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$2.45 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel added 2.5 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.325.  To contact the reporter on this story:
