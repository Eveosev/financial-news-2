Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened for
a second day after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Port Arthur refinery
had a power failure and compressors tripped offline at Motiva
Enterprises LLC’s plant in the Texas city.  There wasn’t a material impact to production from the 10-
minute outage at the Valero refinery,  Bill Day , a company
spokesman based in San Antonio, said in an e-mail. Motiva’s
compressors tripped because of high pressure, according to a
filing with state regulators.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  narrowed 0.55 cent to 6.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
7.04 cents to $2.5635 a gallon.  The same fuel in  Chicago  weakened 2.5 cents to a discount
of 13 cents a gallon versus futures. It’s the lowest level since
July 22.  U.S. gasoline inventories may have risen 1.2 million
barrels last week, to 216.2 million, according to the median
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The Energy
Department reports fuel inventories tomorrow at 10:30 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
