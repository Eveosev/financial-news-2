Russia  has issued 592,000 Emission
Reduction Units, including 234,810 to Orbeo, the carbon-trading
venture of Societe Generale SA and Rhodia SA, the Russian carbon
registry said today.  ERUs are issued under the  United Nations ’ Joint
Implementation program, which focuses on Eastern Europe and
Russia and is the second-biggest greenhouse gas offset program
overseen by the UN after the Clean Development Mechanism. Each
ERU corresponds to one metric ton of carbon dioxide.  Units from JI projects can be used by factories and power
stations to comply with caps set under the European Union’s
emissions trading system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
