The upper Great Plains and Midwest
may be warmer than normal next week, while meteorologists are
divided on what will happen along the U.S. East Coast.  MDA EarthSat Weather and Commodity Weather Group LLC both
predict the East Coast may be 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to
2.8 Celsius) above normal from Dec. 18 to Dec. 22. Weather
Derivatives’ 6- to 10-day outlook calls for East Coast
temperatures to be more seasonal.  The warmth across much of the eastern U.S. this week has
convinced Commodity President  Matt Rogers  that the trend will
continue for the short term. That may change for the 11- to 15-
day outlook, he said from his office in Bethesda,  Maryland .  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling.  Power plants  use about
30 percent of the nation’s natural gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  In his outlook for Dec. 23 to Dec. 27, Rogers calls for
most of the U.S. to be more seasonal. Temperatures in the
Northeast and parts of Nevada and Idaho may be 3 degrees higher
than normal, he said.  In its 11- to 15-day outlook, MDA predicts colder-than-
normal temperatures across the Southwest, with parts of the
upper Great Plains and Northeast remaining about 3 to 4 degrees
warmer.  Weather Derivatives, in Belton,  Missouri , doesn’t issue a
comparable forecast.  For Dec. 22, the normal average temperature in  New York  is
about 36 degrees, according to MDA in Gaithersburg, Maryland. In
Boston it’s 33; in Atlanta, 44; Houston, 54;  St. Louis , 32;
Chicago, 26; Seattle, 40; and in Burbank, California, it’s 54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
