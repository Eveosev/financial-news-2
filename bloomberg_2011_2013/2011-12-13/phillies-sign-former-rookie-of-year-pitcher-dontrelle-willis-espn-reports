The  Philadelphia Phillies  agreed to
terms with Major League Baseball free-agent pitcher Dontrelle Willis, according to ESPN.  Willis and the Phillies agreed on a one-year deal pending a
physical, the  network reported  today citing an unidentified
person in baseball. The deal will pay the 29-year-old left-
hander about $1 million and includes performance-related
bonuses.  Phillies spokesman Greg Casterioto didn’t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment.  Willis was 1-6 with a 5.00 earned-run average in 13 starts
with the  Cincinnati Reds  last year. He is 72-69 with a 4.17
earned run average in a nine-year career with four teams.  A two-time All-Star, Willis won the 2003 National League
Rookie of the Year award with the  Florida Marlins . He hasn’t
started more than 13 games in a season since 2007, his final
year in Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
