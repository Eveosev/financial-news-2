Fuji Xerox Co. ,  Japan ’s third-
biggest copier maker, aims to increase  China  sales by 67 percent
in three years by doubling the number of dealerships and
boosting its sales force.  “China is the world’s No. 1 market, where there is a great
demand for both high- and low-end products,” President Tadahito Yamamoto said in an interview in  Tokyo  today. “We plan to sell
1 million low-end copiers in China by fiscal 2015.”  Fuji Xerox, 25 percent owned by closely held Xerox Ltd.,
has been expanding its business to China and Asia Pacific
countries. The Tokyo-based company plans to boost its overseas
sales ratio to 50 percent in the year ending March 2014 from 41
percent in fiscal 2010, led by  developing countries , mainly
China, Yamamoto said today.  Fuji Xerox, a subsidiary of  Fujifilm Holdings Corp. (4901) ,
operates in 28 cities in China. The company had sales of 60
billion yen ($772 million) in the world’s most-populous nation
in fiscal 2010 and is aiming for 100 billion yen in three years,
Yamamoto said.  The company plans to increase its dealerships in three
years to 1,200, compared with 600 now, and expand its sales
force in two years to 1,000, compared with 700 now, he said.  Fuji Xerox plans to achieve annual sales of 1.1 trillion
yen in the year ending March 2014, up 13 percent from fiscal
2010, Fujifilm  said  in October.  Fujifilm, which makes equipment for medical scans, has been
reported as a possible bidder for Japanese camera maker  Olympus
Corp. (7733)  Yamamoto, who also is a board member at Fujifilm, declined
to comment on a possible buyout of Olympus today.  Fujifilm Chief Executive Officer Shigetaka Komori said last
month it was too early to discuss Olympus issues while the
third-party panel was still probing the fraud at the camera
maker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
