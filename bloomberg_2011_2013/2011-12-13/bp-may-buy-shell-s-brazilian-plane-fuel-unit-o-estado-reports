BP Plc may buy a Brazilian airplane
fuel production unit half-owned by Royal Dutch Shell Plc for as
much as 200 million reais ($109 million), O Estado de Sao Paulo
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  BP has signed a binding offer with Raizen, a venture half-
owned by Shell, to acquire the assets, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said. The letter has been delivered to the Brazilian
competition regulator, known as Cade, which had ordered Raizen
to sell the assets, the newspaper said.  Shell acquired the fuel production assets in 2009 from
Cosan SA Industria & Comercio, before the two companies formed
Raizen, Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
