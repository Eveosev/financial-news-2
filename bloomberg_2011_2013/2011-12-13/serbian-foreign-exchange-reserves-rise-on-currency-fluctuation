Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
rose 125.5 million euros ($125.5 million) to almost 11.4 billion
euros in November on more-convenient exchange rates for the
country’s assets, the central bank said.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , rose to 6.61 billion euros from 6.57 billion euros in
October, the  Narodna Banka Srbije  said. This equaled 448 percent
of M1 money supply, up from 443 percent in the previous month,
or about eight months of imports.  The Balkan country spent 12.6 million euros from the
reserves on servicing external debt last month, while commercial
lenders withdrew 17 million euros from their mandatory reserve
accounts kept with the central bank. Inflows included 6.4
million euros from donations, the central bank said.  Interbank trading volumes fell 7.5 percent to 1.16 billion
euros in November, while the 11-month trading total reached 17.4
billion euros, the central bank said.  The dinar weakened a nominal 3.4 percent against the euro
in November, while remaining 1.5 percent stronger against the
common European currency this year so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
