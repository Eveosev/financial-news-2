Houston Ship Channel pilots resumed
boarding deep-draft vessels about 3 p.m. local time today after
suspending transits for about seven hours because of heavy fog,
the U.S. Coast Guard said.  About four ships were waiting to pass through the channel
when service resumed, Richard Brahm, a Coast Guard spokesman,
said in an interview.  Pilots stopped boardings shortly after 8 a.m., shortly
after two ships collided, Brahm said. That accident is under
investigation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
