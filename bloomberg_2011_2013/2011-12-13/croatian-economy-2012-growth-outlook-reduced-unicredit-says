The Croatian economy will probably
contract 0.5 percent in 2012 on the weaker global outlook and
the government’s fiscal tightening,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  said in a
revision of a 1 percent growth forecast.  There will be no economic growth this year, compared with a
September forecast of 0.2 percent growth in 2011,  Goran Saravanja , the chief economist of  Zagrebacka Banka d.d. (ZABARA) , a unit
of Italy’s UniCredit group, today in an e-mailed statement.  The budget deficit will narrow to 5 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012, compared with a forecast of 6 percent
for this year and reflecting “expectations from the new
government,” according to Saravanja.  The ruling  Croatian Democratic Union  was dethroned on Dec.
4 by an opposition bloc led by the  Social Democrats , which is
expected to form the government by the end of the year. Premier-
Elect Zoran Milanovic said on Dec. 6 he will introduce fiscal
measures within 50 days of taking office to bolster the
country’s credit rating and avoid seeking international aid.  “The main focus in the near-term will be the economic
policy initiatives the new government announces, given that
 Croatia ’s sovereign credit rating is on the bottom investment
grade rung, with two out of three agencies maintaining a
negative outlook,” Saravanja said.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
