Cooperative Bank of Kenya Ltd. (COOP) , the
East African nation’s fifth-largest lender by market value, fell
for the first session in three on expectations of reduced
earnings and increased provisions against bad debt.  The stock dropped as much as 4.2 percent to 11.50 before it
pared losses to 2.1 percent at 11.55 as of 2:31 p.m. in Nairobi.
Yesterday was a public holiday.  “The drop is due to expectations of reduced earnings on
account of lower credit growth and increased provision for
doubtful debt as the higher interest rates increase chances of
default,” Eva Njuguna a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Sterling Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview.  Commercial banks are expected to extend the loan repayment
period, absorb additional costs and not raise  interest rates 
again despite an increase in the benchmark rate, Richard Etemesi
the Kenya Bankers Association chairman told reporters today in
Nairobi. Kenyan lenders have raised their interest rates on
borrowed funds to match the rise in the benchmark rate to 18
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
