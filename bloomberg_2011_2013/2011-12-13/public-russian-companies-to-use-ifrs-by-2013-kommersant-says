Public companies in  Russia  will
begin using International Financial Reporting Standards in 2012
and publish their accounts on this basis in 2013, Kommersant
said, citing Leonid Shneidman, a Finance Ministry official.  At present, 65 percent of public companies report earnings
using international standards, the newspaper said.  OAO Surgutneftegas , Russiaâ€™s fourth-largest oil producer
and the  oil company  with the most cash, reports using only
Russian accounting standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
