Almost two-thirds of voters in
 Scotland  want a referendum on independence from the rest of the
U.K. before 2014, the Times reported, citing an Ipsos MORI poll
for the newspaper.  The poll showed a nine-point rise in the past four months
in those Scots who want the vote held before First Minister Alex Salmond who pledged in May to conduct the vote from 2014
onwards, the second half of this parliamentary term.  A total of 64 percent want it held within the next two
years, compared with 55 percent four months ago, with 33 percent
saying it should be held as soon as possible, the poll showed.  Support for a referendum to be held between two and five
years from now, that is from 2014 onwards, is at 29 percent,
down 8 points from August, according to the poll. Support for
independence among Scots certain to vote has risen by three
points since August and is now at 38 percent.  The majority of Scots, 57 percent, want Scotland to remain
part of the U.K., down three points from August. About 68
percent of Scots want more financial and other powers devolved
to the Scottish parliament, compared with 28 percent who
disagree.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
