Chubb Corp. (CB) ’s Vigilant Insurance
unit won the dismissal of a lawsuit in which  Bear Stearns Cos. 
accused the insurer of breaching a contract by refusing to pay
part of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settlement.  Bear Stearns in March 2006 agreed to pay $250 million to
settle regulators’ claims it was at the center of a system for
clients to break mutual-fund trading rules. The accord comprised
$160 million in wrongful profit and a $90 million civil penalty.  Bear Stearns, which was bought by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  in
2008, demanded that Vigilant indemnify it for the $160 million
in profit. The insurer refused on the ground that the payment
wasn’t an insurable loss or was excluded from coverage.  A state appeals court in  Manhattan  today granted Vigilant’s
motion to dismiss the complaint. It reversed a September 2010
ruling by Justice Charles Ramos of state  Supreme Court .
Disgorgement of “ill-gotten gains or restitutionary damages”
are not insurable under state law, the  appeals court said .  “The public-policy rationale for this rule is that the
deterrent effect of a disgorgement action would be greatly
undermined if wrongdoers were permitted to shift the cost of
disgorgement to an insurer,” Justice Richard T. Andrias wrote
for the court.  Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on the
ruling.  The case is J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. v. Vigilant
Insurance Co., 600979/2009, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
