The U.S.  Postal Service  agreed not
to close post offices or mail-processing facilities before May
15 to give Congress time to change laws restricting the
service’s operations and finances, 15 U.S. senators said.  As part of the agreement, the Postal Service won’t have to
make a $5 billion payment this year to prefund future health-
care costs for retirees, Senator  Bernard Sanders , a Vermont
Independent, said today at a press conference in Washington.  Congress will look for ways to allow the Postal Service to
be more “entrepreneurial,” Sanders said. Congress will seek to
legalize the mailing of wine and beer and remove bans on the
agency providing notary services and issuing hunting and fishing
licenses, he said.  “I feel that if we just cut, cut, cut, it will create a
death spiral that will make the agency a weaker and less
efficient institution,” Sanders said.  The service, which is supposed to be self-supporting, last
month predicted a $14.1 billion loss in 2012 as mail volume
continues to drop. It asked its regulator Dec. 5 for permission
to slow delivery of letters and bills to save $2.1 billion a
year.  The service said in September it may close 252, or more
than half, its mail-processing plants.  Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has asked Congress,
which oversees Postal Service activities, to allow him to break
labor contracts; close 3,700, or 12 percent, of post offices;
and end Saturday mail delivery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
