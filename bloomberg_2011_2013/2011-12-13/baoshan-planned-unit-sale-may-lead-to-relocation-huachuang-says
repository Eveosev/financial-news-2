Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) ’s plan to
sell some stainless steel and specialty-steel assets may be a
prelude to relocating the units, Huachuang Securities Co. said.  Baoshan Steel proposes to sell the assets to parent
Baosteel Group Corp.,  China ’s biggest publicly traded steelmaker
said in a Dec. 11 filing to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange .  “Judging from the statement, relocation of Baoshan’s
stainless and specialty-steel units has been put on the
agenda,” Huachuang analyst Han Zhenguo, based in Shanghai, said
in a note dated Dec. 11. Huachuang recommends a “buy” on the
Baoshan Steel stock.  Yu Hong, a securities affairs representative of Baoshan,
declined to comment on the report.  Baoshan Steel’s main plants, located on the northern
outskirts of  Shanghai , account for almost 25 percent of the
city’s energy demand and contribute about 6 percent of its gross
domestic product, Huachuang said. China, the world’s biggest
steelmaker, is seeking to move some alloy-making operations to
reduce energy consumption and cut pollution in cities, according
to the nation’s  steel industry plan  for 2011-2015.  Baoshan may swap assets with its parent while selling the
units or buy assets from other companies, Huachuang’s Han said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
