Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, sold its remaining stake in life insurer  Primerica
Inc. (PRI)  for $180.1 million as Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit 
completes the bank’s exit that started almost two years ago.  Citigroup sold about 8.1 million shares in a public
offering, the Duluth, Georgia-based insurer said today in a
statement. The firm sold the shares for $22.29 apiece. Primerica
last month agreed to buy back 8.92 million shares held by New
York-based Citigroup for $22.42 a share, or about $200 million.  Pandit has been reducing the bank’s stake in Primerica
since selling a portion in a March 2010 public offering. Pandit,
54, included the firm among more than $600 billion of businesses
and assets he wanted to sell or wind down after Citigroup took a
$45 billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008.  Primerica fell 93 cents, or 4 percent, to $22.29 at 4:15
p.m. in New York trading. The shares have fallen 8 percent this
year. Citigroup dropped 1.2 percent to $26.90, bringing its
decline for the year to 43 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
