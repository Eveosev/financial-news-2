ATC International Group Ltd. , a
Chinese maker of smart meters, may build a factory in Brazil to
meet the country’s growing demand for the electronic power
gauges.  ATC is waiting for the government to issue rules specifying
minimum technical requirements for smart meters before deciding
to build a plant, David Y.N. Liang, the Hong Kong-based
company’s chief executive officer, said today in a telephone
interview.  The rules may be issued early next year and if ATC moves
forward, it may partner with a local company to open a plant in
early 2013, he said. Brazil is seeking to replace all 63 million
of its standard meters with electronic ones with wireless
capabilities in an effort to fight electricity theft, he said.  “ Brazil  will become one of the world’s top five markets”
for smart meters, he said. “It’s sizable. We’ll use it as a
base for expansion” into other South American countries.  ATC’s partner “may build the factory, we may provide the
production equipment,” Liang said.  Utilities are using smart meters to spot houses that are
illegally tapping electricity from the grid and then remotely
disconnecting them, he said.  A national smart-meter replacement program may be announced
by Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy by the end of 2012,
Andre Pepitone da Nobrega, director of electricity regulator
Agencia Nacional de Energia Eletrica, said Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
