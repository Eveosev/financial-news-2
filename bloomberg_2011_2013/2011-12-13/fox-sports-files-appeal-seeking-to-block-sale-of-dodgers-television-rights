Fox Sports Net West 2 LLC filed an
appeal seeking to block the sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers
baseball team’s television-broadcasting rights.  The  News Corp. (NWSA)  unit’s so-called notice of appeal is the
first step in its attempt to persuade a federal district court
to overturn a decision by the bankruptcy judge overseeing the
Dodgers’ case to allow the team to solicit bids for the rights.  The filing didn’t include any legal arguments or details
about why Fox believes the Dec. 8 decision by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Kevin Gross in Wilmington, Delaware, should be overturned.  Dodgers owner  Frank McCourt  is selling the team, which
filed for bankruptcy in June. To increase the value of the team,
the Dodgers are soliciting separate offers for the rights to
televise future games, which Fox holds through next year.  Gross gave the team permission to begin trying to sell the
rights months before the Dodgers’ current contract with Fox
allows. Fox argued in court that it will be harmed by
accelerating negotiations.  The case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-12010,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
