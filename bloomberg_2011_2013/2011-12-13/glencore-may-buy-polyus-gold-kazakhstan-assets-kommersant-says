Glencore International Plc’s Kazzinc
unit is in talks with Polyus Gold International Ltd. to buy the
Russian gold producer’s assets in  Kazakhstan ,  Kommersant 
reported today, citing people it didn’t identify.  The Assaubayev family, which had exclusive rights to buy
out Polyus’ Kazakh assets, failed to find the funds by a Dec. 12
deadline, Kommersant said. Polyus is now free to talk about a
sale with other potential buyers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
