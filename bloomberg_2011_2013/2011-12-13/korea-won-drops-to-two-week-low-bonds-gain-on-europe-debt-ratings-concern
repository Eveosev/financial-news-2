South Korea ’s won slid to a two-week
low as rating companies said last week’s European summit did
little to ease the region’s debt crisis.  The Kospi index of shares dropped 1.9 percent to this
month’s low after Moody’s Investors Service said the summit
offered few new measures and doesn’t diminish the risk of
credit-rating downgrades for European nations.  Fitch Ratings 
said a comprehensive solution has not yet been offered and
predicted a “significant economic downturn” in the region.
South Korea’s economy may expand less than the government
forecast of 3.7 percent next year if the European situation
deteriorates, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said yesterday.  “The European summit failed to reassure investors the debt
crisis will ease soon, and this is fueling concern about an
economic slowdown,” said Kim Doo Hyun, a senior currency dealer
at Korea Exchange Bank in  Seoul . “We’re seeing more of
importers’ dollar buying than exporters’ selling in the local
 currency market , which is also putting pressure on the won.”  The won fell for a fourth day, declining 0.6 percent to
1,153.99 per dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,160.00 earlier, the weakest level since
Nov. 28.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.5 percent bonds due September
2016 declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to a
one-week low of 3.49 percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc.
