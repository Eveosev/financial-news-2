Libya ’s eastern city of Benghazi,
where protests that led to the ouster of the late Muammar
Qaddafi began, will become the country’s new economic capital,
the head of the ruling National Transitional Council said.  “Life and activity will return to all cities,” Mustafa
Abdel Jalil said in a news conference in Tripoli today.
“Benghazi will be the first economic city in Libya.”  Benghazi was marginalized during the old regime and its
people suffered from a lack of basic services. All economic
institutions were centralized and based in the capital.  The NTC was created in Benghazi in March and many of its
members are from the city.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
