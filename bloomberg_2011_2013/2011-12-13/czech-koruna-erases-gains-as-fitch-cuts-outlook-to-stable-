The koruna erased gains after  Fitch
Ratings  cut the Czech Republic’s outlook to “stable” from
“positive.”  The Czech currency weakened less than 0.1 percent to 25.661
per euro at 5:08 p.m. in Prague after earlier strengthening as
much as 0.5 percent. The PX  index (PX)  of stocks closed 0.2 percent
higher at 862.2 before the Fitch statement.  Fitch, which reaffirmed the country’s A+ assessment, said
the outlook revision reflected the deterioration of the growth
outlook in the euro area, the Czech Republic’s main trading
partner.  Czech gross domestic product growth “has already slowed to
a virtual standstill,” Michele Napolitano, a Fitch director,
said in a statement. “The 2012 deficit is likely to slightly
overshoot the government’s forecast, given an optimistic growth
assumption.”  The koruna strengthened earlier today after a Czech central
banker said further interest rate cuts wouldn’t help the economy
and a report showed that investor confidence in  Germany 
improved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
