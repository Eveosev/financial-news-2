Serbia  may fail again in March to
become a candidate for European Union membership because it
won’t recognize Kosovo, Beta  news agency  reported, citing Deputy
Premier Ivica Dacic.  After the EU last week postponed deciding on Serbia’s
application by three months and the country’s president pledged
to keep striving for EU integration, Dacic said there may be no
progress in March because some EU states demand that Serbia
first officially accept the secession of its Albanian-dominated
breakaway province, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
