OPEC’s crude production rose in
November as higher output from  Libya ,  Saudi Arabia ,  Angola  and
 Nigeria  offset cuts in supply from Algeria, Venezuela and the
United Arab Emirates, the group’s secretariat said.  The 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries bound by quotas produced 27.687 million barrels a day
in November, Vienna-based OPEC said today in its monthly oil
market report. Production climbed 1.8 percent from 27.187
million barrels in October, OPEC said, citing secondary sources
for the data.  Saudi Arabia increased output last month by 1.9 percent to
9.597 million barrels a day, Libya by 64 percent to 570,000
barrels a day, Angola by 6 percent to 1.833 million barrels a
day and Nigeria by 4.1 percent to 2.077 million barrels a day,
the report said.  Algeria  reduced production by 1.6 percent to
1.239 million barrels a day, and the United Arab Emirates cut by
2 percent to 2.515 million barrels a day, according to OPEC.  The Saudi production figure for November in the report is
smaller than that provided by Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al- Naimi, who said yesterday the kingdom pumped 10.047 million
barrels a day last month. Naimi, arriving in Vienna for a
meeting of OPEC ministers on Dec. 14, said he was happy with the
group’s current oil production amid demand from “all over.”  Quota Busters  OPEC will probably fail to set a target that more closely
matches production, according to all but five of 26 traders and
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News from Dec. 6 to Dec. 8.
Instead, the group OPEC is likely to stick with a 3-year-old
ceiling that members are exceeding by 11 percent. OPEC has kept
its quota unchanged at eight meetings since December 2008, when
the group announced record supply cuts.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 amid a
collapse in global demand. The decision capped production at
24.845 million barrels a day for all members except  Iraq .  OPEC’s output including Iraq increased by 1.9 percent to
30.367 million barrels a day in November, the report said. Iraq
is exempt from the quota system. The group’s members are
Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
 Qatar , Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
