The proportion of U.K. voters
wanting to leave the European Union has seen a “marked
decline” in a poll carried out after Prime Minister  David Cameron  refused to support an EU-wide treaty to rescue the euro.  The survey by  YouGov Plc (YOU)  for the Sun newspaper found 43
percent of respondents would vote to leave the EU if there were
a referendum, compared with 52 percent in a poll in August.
Thirty-six percent said they would vote to stay in the EU in the
 survey  of 1,724 voters carried out online on Dec. 11 and
yesterday.  “We found a marked decline in the number wanting to leave
the EU,” YouGov President Peter Kellner said in an e-mailed
briefing note. “This is the narrowest result that YouGov has
detected in recent times.”  Cameron’s action at a summit in Brussels on Dec. 9 has
decreased Britain’s influence in  Europe , according to 51 percent
of respondents, compared with 11 percent who thought it had
increased British influence, the poll found. At the same time,
58 percent said the prime minister was right to block the
treaty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
