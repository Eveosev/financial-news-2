Alstom SA (ALO)  Chief Executive Officer
Patrick Kron said he’s “confident” the French maker of trains
and power stations will have positive  cash flow  in its fiscal
second half after an outflow in the first six months.  “The first half showed a substantial cash outflow and some
of the reasons are not recurring,” Kron said today near Naples,
Italy, where the company was presenting a new high-speed train.
“Our expectation is to be cash-positive for the second half.”  Kron said he expects “some stability and gradual
recovery” for the transport division’s operating margin, as a
“recovery in sales is going to be gradual.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
