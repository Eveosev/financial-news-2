The U.S. violated  Iran ’s airspace
and must be held accountable for infringing on international
laws, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast  said
in Tehran today.  Mehmanparast spoke one day after President Barack Obama
said the U.S. has asked Iran to return a drone aircraft that
U.S. controllers lost contact with on Dec. 4.  Iran has said it shot down the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft
in the country’s east and that it is close to accessing
information stored in it. Iranian officials have identified the
drone as the RQ-170 Sentinel and showed images of it on
television last week.  The aircraft will remain in Iran’s possession as part of
the country’s assets, Iran’s Defense Minister Brigadier General
Ahmad Vahidi said today, according to the state-run  Press TV 
news channel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
