Fiat SpA (F)  and Fiat Industrial SpA
signed a collective labor deal with their 86,000 Italian
employees that increases shifts and shortens breaks in exchange
for a 20-billion euro ($26 billion) investment plan.  Workers’ base salary will rise 5.2 percent, Roberto Di
Maulo, head of the Fismic union, said in a telephone interview
from Turin. Employees will also receive a 600-euro production
bonus in 2012 and be paid 10 percent more for overtime, he said.  “The agreement signed today signals a historic moment for
our company and its workers,” Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said in an e-mailed statement without providing the
agreement’s financial details.  The one-year contract, which goes into effect in January,
is part of Marchionne’s strategy of raising productivity at
Turin, Italy-based Fiat’s domestic plants as he aims to end
losses in  Europe  by 2014. Italy’s inflation rate calculated
using European Union standards declined in November to 3.7
percent from the three-year high of 3.8 percent in October.  Fiat closed up 1 cent, or 0.3 percent, at 3.76 euros in
Milan trading. The shares have dropped 44 percent this year,
valuing the carmaker at 4.71 billion euros. Fiat Industrial
closed up 8 cents, or 1.2 percent, at 6.29 euros.  Capacity Utilization  Burdened by a dearth of new models, capacity utilization at
Fiat’s Italian plants was just 38 percent in the first nine
months of 2011, compared with 76 percent at the carmaker’s other
European factories, according to a Dec. 8 company presentation.  “Labor flexibility only helps if your plants are close to
full capacity,” said Erich Hauser, a Credit Suisse analyst in
 London  with an “underperform” rating on Fiat shares. “With 30%
plant utilization ratios, I struggle to see the benefit of
having a more efficient  labor force . Labor costs seem to
increase with the new contract.”  The deal will apply to new hires as well, Di Maulo said.
Fiat workers will have to ratify the agreement at every plant,
where the unions will hold votes over the next two months, a
spokesman or the Uilm union spokesman said.  Fiom Cgil, the carmaker’s biggest union and the only one
not to sign the agreement, has claimed the deal curtails worker
rights. It led an eight-hour strike yesterday at the company’s
Italian plants. The union’s roughly 10,000 workers will
nonetheless fall under the agreement if it’s ratified.  Chrysler Rebound  Some 22,000 factory workers in  Italy  assembled 650,000 cars
in 2009, while the 6,100 employees at Fiat’s plant in Tychy,
 Poland , built 600,000 vehicles. Without taking into account
differences in models or working hours, Fiat’s Italian workers
made 30 cars a year on average, compared with almost 100 in
Poland.  Rebounding sales at Chrysler Group LLC, which Fiat
controls, are helping prop up the Italian automaker. Third-
quarter earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items,
which Fiat calls trading profit, rose to 851 million euros from
256 million euros a year earlier, with the U.S. company
contributing 65 percent to the overall result. Fiat fully
consolidated Chrysler’s results from June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
