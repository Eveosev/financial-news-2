Copper fell for a second day on
renewed concern that European leaders won’t agree on ways to
expand the region’s rescue packages.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is rejecting increasing the
upper limit of funding for Europe’s permanent bailout mechanism.
U.S.  equities (SPX)  pared gains, and the euro declined to an 11-month
low against the dollar. Copper has slumped 23 percent this year
as Europe’s debt woes escalated.  “This is a skittish market,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a market
strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in
an e-mail. “We are seeing a macro-based move. The strength in
the dollar is causing copper gains to evaporate, and stocks
moving lower from the morning rally is contributing to the
selloff.”  Copper futures for March delivery slid 0.6 percent to close
at $3.4415 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
metal dropped 2.6 percent yesterday, the most in three weeks,
after Moody’s Investors Service said it will review the credit
ratings of European Union nations.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months slipped 0.1 percent to $7,600 a metric ton ($3.45 a
pound).  Aluminum, zinc, nickel, tin and lead also fell in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
