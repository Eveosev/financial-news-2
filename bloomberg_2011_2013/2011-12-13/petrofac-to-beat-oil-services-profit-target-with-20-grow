Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the U.K. oilfield
services and engineering provider, said it will beat its profit
target in 2011 as it works through a record order backlog.  Net income will rise at least 20 percent, the London-based
company said today in a statement, more than the 15 percent goal
set at the start of the year. Petrofac expects to have an order
backlog of $10.6 billion on Dec. 31, compared with last year’s
record $11.7 billion, and will have $1.3 billion in cash.  “We have a robust backlog, a strong financial position and
a good outlook for the bid pipeline,” Chief Financial Officer
Tim Weller said on a conference call with journalists. “We’re
very confident about our medium-term target of at least doubling
our earnings by 2015.”  Chief Executive Officer Ayman Asfari is expanding in
 Thailand , Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria. This year Petrofac
has won contracts in  Mexico  and was hired to upgrade floating
production and storage facilities in the U.K. North Sea. The
company reported net income of $557.8 million last year.  Petrofac added 5.1 percent to 1,443 pence as of the 4:30
p.m. close in  London . The shares are down 9 percent this year.  “Given our excellent earnings visibility, we expect to
deliver strong growth in 2012,” Asfari said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
