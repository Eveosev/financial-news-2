Siberian Agrarian Holding Group is
in merger talks to form one of  Russia ’s largest agricultural
holdings, said Pavel Skurikhin, the company’s chairman.  Siberian Agrarian is holding negotiations with a Russian
and a Mid-Eastern company, Skurikhin said in Moscow today,
adding the talks may be completed next year.  The Novosibirsk, Siberia-based company is interested in
enhancing bread baking, entering the meat segment and increasing
its scale to reduce costs after the merger, Skurikhin said.  Siberian Agrarian is ready to sell 30 percent to 35 percent
of its land to reduce debt leverage, he said. The company
operates about 400,000 hectares (988,400 acres), of which it
owns 250,000 hectares, he said.  Skurikhin didn’t provide the company’s operating results
and this year’s harvest size because of the talks with potential
partners. He said the company’s crop is larger than in last
year. In 2010, the company harvested about 200,000 metric tons
of grain, or 60 percent less than planned as Russia suffered its
worst drought in at least 50 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
