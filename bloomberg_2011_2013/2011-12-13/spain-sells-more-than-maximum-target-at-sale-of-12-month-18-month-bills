Spain  sold 4.94 billion euros ($6.52
billion) of bills, more than the maximum target, and its
borrowing costs fell.  The Madrid-based Treasury said it sold 12-month debt at an
average yield of 4.050 percent, compared with 5.022 percent at
an auction on Nov. 15. It sold 18-month paper at 4.226 percent,
down from 5.159 percent last month.  Demand for the 12-month securities rose to 3.14 times the
amount sold, compared with 2.13 last month, and the bid-to-cover
for the longer-dated paper was 4.97 times compared with 5.96
previously. Spain aimed to auction as much as 4.25 billion
euros. An official at the Treasury, who declined to be
identified in line with government policy, said it sold more
than the target because of the high volume of non-competitive
demand, or bids that accept the rates that are determined by the
auction. There was also an increase in demand from retail, or
non-institutional investors.  “A positive set of Spanish auction results but providing
only temporary relief given the ongoing systemic issues and
related downgrade threat besetting the region,”  Richard
McGuire , a fixed income strategist at Rabobank in  London , said
in an e-mail. “These sales represent a temporary stay of
execution.”  Pressure on Ratings  European Union leaders’ efforts to move towards a new
fiscal accord at a summit on Dec. 9 lacks a “comprehensive
solution,” increasing pressure on sovereign credit ratings,
 Fitch Ratings  said yesterday. Meanwhile, Moody’s Investors
Service plans to review all its European ratings. The yield on
Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  rose yesterday above the 6
percent level that prompted the  European Central Bank  to start
buying Spanish debt in August.  Spain’s shorter maturity bonds gained after the sale with
the yield on benchmark two-year debt falling 14 basis points to
4.34 percent. The yield on the 10-year bond rose 8 basis points
to 5.865 percent, widening the gap with German equivalents to
381 basis points, from 377 basis points yesterday.  Spain’s Parliament opened today after the pro-business
People’s Party won a landslide victory in national elections
on Nov. 20. Prime Minister-elect  Mariano Rajoy  pledged
“important decisions” yesterday on austerity and measures to
overhaul the economy when his Cabinet holds its first meeting on
Dec. 23.  The Treasury aims to sell as much as 3.5 billion euros of
bonds maturing in 2016, 2020 and 2021 on Dec. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
