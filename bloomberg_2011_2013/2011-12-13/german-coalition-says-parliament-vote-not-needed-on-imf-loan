Leaders of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s ruling coalition said a parliamentary vote won’t be
needed on Bundesbank loans to the  International Monetary Fund  to
tackle the European debt crisis.  Michael Meister, a vice chairman of Merkel’s Christian
Democratic-led caucus in parliament, said the lower house, or
Bundestag, doesn’t need to vote on loans aimed at increasing the
IMF’s lending capacity because it doesn’t affect Germany’s
federal budget. Free Democratic floor leader  Rainer Bruederle 
concurred, saying a Bundestag vote was not needed.  “We respect all decisions taken by the Bundesbank on its
own within the established legal framework,” Meister said in an
e-mailed statement today. Bruederle told reporters in Berlin
that parliament must respect the Bundesbank’s independence.  Leaders at last week’s European Union summit extracted a
contribution from euro central banks of 150 billion euros ($197
billion) toward the IMF’s general resources. Another 50 billion
euros will come from non-euro EU states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
