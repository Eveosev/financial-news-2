Home prices in  Southern California 
fell 4.2 percent last month from a year earlier as financing for
high-end properties became harder to get,  DataQuick  said.  The median paid for houses and condominiums was $275,000 in
Los Angeles, Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino and
Orange counties, down from $287,000 in November 2010, the San
Diego-based data seller said today in a report. Prices were up
1.9 percent from $270,000 in October.  Home sales of $500,000 or more declined almost 16 percent
from a year earlier because of reduced loan limits in higher-
priced markets that took effect Oct. 1, the company said. In Los
Angeles and Orange counties, the limit was cut from $725,750 to
$625,000.  “Part of it is the economy and would-be buyers’
uncertainty -- about jobs,  home prices  and a potential surge in
foreclosed properties hitting the market,” DataQuick President
 John Walsh  said in a statement. “Part of it’s the folks who
can’t move up because they’re upside down with their mortgages.
And many who want to buy more expensive homes struggle with the
financing.”  Jumbo loans, mortgages above the old conforming limit of
$417,000, made up about 15 percent of last month’s purchase
lending, down from about 18 percent a year ago, DataQuick said.  A total of 16,884 homes sold in the region last month, up
4.2 percent from a year earlier and 0.3 percent from October,
driven by demand from first-time buyers and investors for
properties priced below $400,000. The number of houses sold in
that range rose 6.1 percent in November from a year earlier,
DataQuick said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
