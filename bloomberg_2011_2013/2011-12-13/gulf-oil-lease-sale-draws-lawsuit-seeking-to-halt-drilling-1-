Oil-lease auctions for the  Gulf of
Mexico  should be halted because regulators failed to fully
consider the risks revealed in the Deepwater Horizon disaster,
according to a lawsuit filed by environmental activist groups.  The groups asked a federal judge in  Washington  today to
block the Interior Department’s first lease sale for oil
production in the Gulf of Mexico since  BP Plc ’s spill in 2010.  The department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn’t
take into account “what this disaster taught us about the
likelihood of oil spills, the difficulty of cleaning them up,
and their environmental impact on the resources and species of
the Gulf,” the groups claimed in their complaint.  Interior Secretary Ken Salazar will open bids for tracts
off the Texas coast at an event in  New Orleans  tomorrow, the
agency said in a statement today. The lease sale attracted 241
bids from 20 companies, the department said.  The groups suing are Oceana Inc., Defenders of Wildlife,
 Natural Resources Defense Council  and the Center for Biological
Diversity.  The case is Oceana v. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
11-02208, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
