Russia will keep its tax on raw
sugar imports at $140 a metric ton in January, the Customs Union
Commission said.  The duty is based on monthly sugar prices in  New York , with
a one-month lag. A minimum rate of $140 a ton is applied from
August through April if the monthly average price in New York
exceeds $396.84 a ton, according to the commission. The duty may
fall to $50 a ton from May through July, while the government
said on Nov. 22 that next year it might extend the $140 level
through that period because of a “high” sugar-beet crop.  The average raw sugar price in New York was calculated at
24.52 cents a pound, or $540.52 a ton in November, the Customs
Union Commission, which oversees the tariffs for Russia, Belarus
and  Kazakhstan , said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
