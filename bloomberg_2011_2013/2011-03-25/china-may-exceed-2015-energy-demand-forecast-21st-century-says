China  may exceed its 2015 energy
demand forecast of the equivalent of 4 billion metric tons of
coal because of growth in energy-intensive industries, the 21st
Century Business Herald reported today, citing  Zhang Guobao ,
former head of the National Energy Administration.  The government didn’t set a cap on total energy consumption
for the five-year plan through 2015 because of the difficulty in
adjusting the nation’s economic structure, where the secondary
industry accounts for a high proportion, the Guangzhou-based
 newspaper said , citing Zhang.  To contact the reporter on this story:
