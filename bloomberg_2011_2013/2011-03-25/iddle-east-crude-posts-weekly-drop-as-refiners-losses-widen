Middle East crude for sale to  Asia 
fell for the week as losses from turning high-sulfur cargoes to
residual products widened.  Oman crude for immediate loading fell 69 cents, or 0.6
percent, this week to $109.56 barrel, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in May was down 64 cents
from last week at $109.28.  Abu Dhabi ’s light Murban grade
declined 56 cents for the week to $112.97.  Refiners’ losses from  fuel oil , the most common product
from processing Middle East crude, widened 2 cents to $9.93 a
barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates, a broker. This crack spread has increased since
reaching $5.97 on March 15, the highest in six months, on
speculation  Japan  won’t be burning more fuel oil as it copes
with power shortages following an earthquake March 11.  The premium of London-traded Brent futures to Dubai crude
swaps declined 8 cents to $6.35 a barrel, based on PVM data. A
narrowing difference indicates it’s profitable for Asian
refiners to ship low-sulfur crude from the Atlantic basin,
compared with Middle East cargoes. The Atlantic basin includes
West Africa, the Mediterranean and the  North Sea .  Futures contracts for Oman crude, the most widely traded
spot grade in Asia, settled at $110.08 a barrel for  May , up 34
cents, the Dubai Mercantile Exchange said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
