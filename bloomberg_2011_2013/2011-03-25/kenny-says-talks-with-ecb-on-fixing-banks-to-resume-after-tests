Irish Prime Minister  Enda Kenny 
said talks with the  European Central Bank  on fixing the
country’s banks will resume after stress tests are published
next week.  The government is pushing the ECB to create medium-term
funding for Irish banks and wean them off emergency liquidity.
Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  has twice traveled to  Frankfurt 
for talks with the ECB, Kenny told reporters in Brussels today.  Irish banks would have more “credibility” in markets if
they had access to a “medium- to long-term funding facility,”
Kenny said in an interview with Dublin-based broadcaster  RTE .
“The ECB accepts it would not be prudent to have immediate fire
sales.”  Kenny said he’s “hopeful” European finance ministers will
“make progress” on easing the terms of Ireland’s bailout after
the capital needs of the banks are clarified. As part of last
year’s international rescue, 35 billion euros ($49.5 billion)
was earmarked for the banks, with the government due to make a
decision on March 31 about how much will be drawn down.  Ireland may have to inject 27.5 billion euros into the
banks, according to a survey of 10 analysts and economists.
Kenny said some of the more “extreme” estimates are based on a
scenario where banks were forced into a “fire sale” of assets
as the ECB seeks to reduce its Irish exposure.  In 2008, Ireland’s government provided a guarantee for six
lenders including the country’s four so-called viable banks that
are the focus of the present stress tests: Bank of Ireland Plc,
Allied Irish Banks Plc, Irish Life & Permanent Plc and EBS
Building Society.  Irish borrowings from the ECB amounted to 116.9 billion
euros, according to figures published this month, in addition to
as much as 70.1 billion euros in exceptional liquidity from the
Irish central bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
