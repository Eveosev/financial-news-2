Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s multiple sclerosis
pill Gilenya will cost 1,850 euros ($2,645) for 28 days in
Germany, according to a company spokesman.  Novartis has set an annual wholesale price of about 24,000
euros for the drug, Eric Althoff, a spokesman for the Basel,
Switzerland-based company, said by phone. Germany is usually
used as an indicator for pricing in other European countries, he
said.  Gilenya, the first multiple sclerosis pill on the market,
will be more expensive than injectable competitors such as
 Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) ’s Avonex,  Merck KGaA (MRK) ’s Rebif and  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ’s Copaxone, Althoff said. The
pill will be cheaper than Biogen’s Tysabri, Althoff said.
Gilenya costs about $48,000 annually in the U.S.  The drug’s German pricing “is based on the more
restrictive label and the general cost of therapies in  Europe ,”
Althoff said.  The European Commission earlier this week cleared the
treatment for use against the relapsing-remitting form of
multiple sclerosis, as the second choice of treatment for
patients with an active form of the disease who’ve used beta
interferon, or as the first drug for those with a rapidly
evolving form of the disease.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Gilenya on
Sept. 22 as the first choice for all patients with the relapsing
form of the disease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
