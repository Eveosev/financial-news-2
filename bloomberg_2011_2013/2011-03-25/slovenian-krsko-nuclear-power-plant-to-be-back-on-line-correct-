Slovenia’s  nuclear power plant  in
Krsko, near the border with  Croatia , will be back on line next
week, plant spokeswoman Ida Novak Jerele said in an e-mailed
statement.  The only nuclear facility in the former  Yugoslavia  halted
output on March 23 due to a power-line outage.  The 730-megawatt plant produces 20 percent of Slovenia’s
electricity and is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
