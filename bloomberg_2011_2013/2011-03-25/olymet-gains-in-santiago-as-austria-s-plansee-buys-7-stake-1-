Molibdenos y Metales SA (MOLYMET) , the
world’s largest molybdenum processor, advanced for the first
time in three days in Santiago trading after Austrian
metallurgical products company Plansee AG bought a stake.  Molymet, as the company is known, climbed 2 percent to
11,046 pesos at 4:21 p.m. New York time.  Plansee bought 8.9 million Molymet shares, or a 7 percent
stake, on the Santiago stock exchange today for 10,650 pesos
each for a total of 95 billion pesos ($198 million), according
to a statement posted on the website of Chile’s securities
regulator. IM Trust SA Corredores de Bolsa advised on the sale.  “The operation involves the entry of a world-class
shareholder and consolidates a commercial and technological
relationship,” John Graell, Molymet’s executive chairman and
chief executive officer, said, according to an e-mailed press
release. Plansee has been a Molymet customer since 1989, the
statement said.  Molymet sold about $266 million in new shares Nov. 10, the
largest equity offering in  Chile  last year. The company is
controlled by Chile’s Mustakis, Gianoli and Matte families,
according to information posted on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
