Hundreds of mercenaries from
Liberia are raping, pillaging and killing in  Ivory Coast ’s
western Guiglo region,  Agence France-Presse  reported, citing
Jacques Franquin, a spokesman for the UN’s refugee agency.  The militias from neighboring Liberia support neither
incumbent Laurent Gbagbo nor his rival Alassane Ouattara and are
exploiting the lawlessness in the embattled region, the news
agency cited Franquin as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
