European stocks rose, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index heading for its first weekly gain in a
month, on optimism a resolution to the region’s debt crisis will
be agreed and prospects for reconstruction in  Japan . Asian
stocks and U.S. index futures also advanced.  Lafarge SA, the world’s biggest cement maker, followed
Asian construction shares higher on speculation the industry
will benefit from rebuilding after Japan’s earthquake. Randgold
Resources Ltd., a producer of the metal in West Africa, gained
1.1 percent as gold climbed.  The Stoxx 600 climbed 0.3 percent to 276.55 at 8:04 a.m. in
 London . The index, which tumbled the most in eight months last
week on fears that Japan’s March 11 earthquake would lead to a
nuclear meltdown, has rebounded 3.3 percent this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
