Nuclear safety and rules for the
planned stress tests on atomic plants caused a “real storm” at
today’s meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels,  Poland ’s
Prime Minister  Donald Tusk  said.  EU leaders discussed issues relating to nuclear power
production in the region and details on the voluntary checks
that are due to be carried out later this year to reassess
safety standards after an atomic accident in  Japan , where an
earthquake and tsunami crippled reactors.  “It is difficult to agree a common stance,” Tusk told a
news conference after the meeting. “There are countries that
have nuclear power and want to have more of it, countries that
have it and want to phase it out, countries that want to ban it
and also countries that don’t have nuclear plants but want to
build them.”  It’s up to national governments in the EU to decide whether
to use nuclear power, which is produced in 14 member countries.
Safety is a shared responsibility between national and EU
authorities.  “I share  France ’s view that we shouldn’t become hysterical
because of the developments in Japan and we should instead
support solutions that will make nuclear even more safe,” Tusk
said. “Surely biomass and wind won’t replace production of
energy from coal or nuclear. If we are talking about
competitiveness of the European economy in the morning, we can’t
declare in the afternoon that we’re ready to kill off energy and
eliminate the most effective and cheapest sources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
