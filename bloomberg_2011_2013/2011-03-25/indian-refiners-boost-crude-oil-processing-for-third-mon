Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s
largest refiner, and rivals including Hindustan Petroleum Corp.
boosted crude processing in February for the third straight
month.  The refiners turned 13.4 million metric tons of crude into
products last month, 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier, the
oil ministry said in a statement in  New Delhi  today.  Processing by state-owned Indian Oil rose 3.6 percent to
4.34 million tons after its plant at Haldia in West Bengal state
increased production by 26 percent. Hindustan Petroleum, the
nation’s third-biggest state refiner, increased output 6.8
percent to 1.33 million tons, according to the ministry.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s biggest
refining complex, produced 2.67 million tons of fuels, a decline
of 3.4 percent from a year earlier.  Essar Oil Ltd. (ESOIL) ,  India ’s
second-biggest non-state refiner, raised output 1 percent.
Reliance didn’t provide data for its newer 29 million ton-a-year
refinery, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
