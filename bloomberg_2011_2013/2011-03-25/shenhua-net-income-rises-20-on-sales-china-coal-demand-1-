China  Shenhua Energy Co., the
listed unit of the nation’s biggest coal producer, posted a 20
percent rise in profit as demand in the world’s fastest-growing
major economy helped push up prices of the fuel.  Net income last year rose to 38.1 billion yuan ($5.8
billion), or 1.91 yuan a share, from 31.7 billion yuan, or 1.59
yuan a share, the previous year, according to a statement
released by the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  Average benchmark power-station coal for immediate delivery
at Qinhuangdao, China’s largest port for the fuel, rose 25
percent last year.  China’s economy  grew 10.3 percent in 2010,
the fastest pace in three years, boosting power demand from
business and households. Coal fuels more than two-thirds of the
nation’s electricity generators. Shenhua’s revenue increased 25
percent to 152 billion yuan, according to today’s statement.  “The numbers are very strong,” said  Helen Lau , an analyst
at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The company should also do
well this year after buying assets from its parent. We think
coal sales should rise by 10 percent.”  Shenhua agreed in December to buy $1.3 billion of assets
from its parent Shenhua Group Corp, which will increase its
recoverable coal reserves by 24 percent to 9.15 billion metric
tons, Shenhua said at the time.  Coal Sales  Coal sales climbed 15 percent in 2010 to 292.6 million tons
and production increased 6.9 percent to 224.8 million tons,
according to a company  statement  on Jan. 24.  The company released unaudited figures in February, saying
profit rose to 37.2 billion yuan in 2010. The energy producer
didn’t release second-half earnings numbers today. Profit in the
first half of last year was 19.3 billion yuan.  Shenhua’s shares rose 11 percent in the past 12 months in
 Hong Kong  trading compared with an 11.4 percent gain in the
benchmark  Hang Seng  index. The stock was at HK$34.80 at the
close today, before the earnings announcement.  The shares are rated “buy” by 26 out of 31 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Four rate the stock a “hold.” Net
income this year may rise to 44.1 billion yuan, according to the
mean estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The economy of China is expected to maintain a steady and
relatively fast growth in 2011, which will boost more demand for
energy, including coal,” Shenhua said in the earnings
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
