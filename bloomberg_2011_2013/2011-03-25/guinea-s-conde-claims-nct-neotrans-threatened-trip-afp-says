Alpha Conde, the president of
Guinea, claimed NCT Neotrans of Paris threatened to disrupt his
trip to France this week because he refused to reconsider the
cancellation of the company’s contract at the port of Conakry,
Agence France-Presse reported.  Conde was cited by the  news agency  as saying he did not
need to re-tender the contract, which was awarded to  Bollore (BOL)  of
France after NCT Neotrans’ deal was scrapped, because Bollore
came second in an earlier round of bidding.  No one was immediately available to comment at NCT
Neotrans’ office in the French capital, according to a woman who
answered the phone and did not identify herself.  To contact the reporter on this story:
