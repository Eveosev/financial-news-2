Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) , the world’s
biggest operator of  Boeing Co. (BA)  737 jets, may start to expand its
aircraft fleet again in 2013 to end its longest no-growth period
in 40 years of flying.  “We’re trying to restore profitability to the point where
it is finally justified to commit to buying airplanes,” Chief
Executive Officer  Gary Kelly  said yesterday in an interview at
Bloomberg’s world headquarters in New York. “2013 is an active
idea in our minds.”  The airline’s likely choice would be Boeing’s 737-800,
which is bigger than Southwest’s current 737 model, Kelly said.
Southwest agreed in December to buy its first 737-800s to add
seats on some routes, fly farther and boost  fuel efficiency .  Southwest put the brakes on fleet growth in 2009 as  travel
demand  crumbled during the recession, reversing a tradition of
annual expansion. The Dallas-based airline has 552 jets, all
737s, and has been taking planes in the past two years only to
replace older aircraft being retired.  No final decision has been made on resuming growth in 2013,
Kelly said, and that may dictate what aircraft type Southwest
buys. Seating capacity will rise as much as 6 percent this year
as Southwest flies its aircraft more.  ‘Little Aggressive’  “We don’t have any plans to grow our fleet in 2011,” said
Kelly, 56. “I think 2012 is probably a little aggressive to
think about a step-up in our fleet mix.”  Southwest rose 14 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $12.68 at 4:15
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
fallen 2.3 percent this year.  “When they do decide to accelerate growth, it will
probably be at the right time,”  Jim Corridore , a  Standard &
Poor’s  equity analyst in New York, said today in an e-mail.
Southwest has shown it knows when to add capacity profitably,
Corridore wrote.  Kelly, who became CEO in 2004, agreed in September to buy
 AirTran Holdings Inc. (AAI)  for about $1.4 billion in cash and stock,
bolstering Southwest’s status as the biggest discount carrier.
One of his challenges will be integrating AirTran’s Boeing 717s,
which are smaller single-aisle jets than Southwest’s 737s.  The airline is awaiting regulatory approval for the
acquisition and expects it to close during the second quarter.
Acquiring  Orlando , Florida-based AirTran will allow Southwest to
begin flights at Atlanta and  Washington ’s Reagan National
airport and expand service from New York’s LaGuardia.  Newark, LaGuardia  Southwest will begin flights from  New Jersey ’s Newark
Liberty International March 27, and Kelly said the carrier is
interested in growing there and at LaGuardia if more takeoff and
landing slots become available.  Service will continue at Long Island MacArthur Airport in
 Islip , New York, even as Southwest boosts service at the larger
New York-area airports, Kelly said. Southwest has 24 daily
departures from Islip.  Southwest has said its new 737-800s will come from a
conversion of existing orders for 737-700s, with deliveries
starting in the first quarter of 2012. The airline hasn’t
specified how many of the current orders were being shifted.  Kelly said Southwest eventually expects to operate 80 to
120 737-800s. The  bigger plane  has 175 seats, 28 percent more
than the 737-700, is about 10 percent more fuel efficient and
should trim costs to fly each seat a mile (1.6 kilometers) by
about 15 percent.  Southwest will “wait for an answer this year” as Boeing
decides whether to upgrade the 737 with more fuel-efficient
engines or design a new plane to succeed the model that is the
world’s most widely flown jetliner, Kelly said.  ‘Not Fast Enough’  “They are not moving fast enough for Southwest,” Kelly
said. “I’ve read all kind of things from Boeing. It’s all over
the map. I’m not paying attention to anything that I read, other
than what I hear from the CEO.”  Boeing is leaning toward developing a successor to the
single-aisle 737 instead of offering new engines, Mike Bair, who
leads the planemaker’s team studying the concept, said March 1.
That jet may enter service as soon as 2019, he said.  Airbus SAS said Dec. 1 it would offer an option of more
fuel-efficient engines for its rival narrow-body A320s,
delivering the so-called A320neo starting in 2016.  “When we have all the real facts, we’ll have to decide at
that point, ‘Are we going to talk to other manufacturers to
seriously study what our alternatives are?’” Kelly said. “I
don’t see any reason to prejudge that yet.”  Southwest has raised ticket prices six times this year, a
rate that Kelly said probably is unprecedented, to help cover a
33 percent jump in the price of  jet fuel  in 2011 through
yesterday. At this point, the airline isn’t considering joining
its biggest U.S. peers in trimming planned 2011 growth to curb
spending on fuel, he said.  “If fuel will moderate from here, we won’t be forced to
seek higher fares to offset that,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
