European Union producers will be
allowed to export 650,000 metric tons of so-called out-of-quota
sugar in 2011-12 as part of the bloc’s regulatory efforts,
according to a proposal by the European Commission.  The commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, won’t consider any
increase of the export limit for the year starting Oct. 1 until
“the early months” of next year, it said in an e-mailed
statement today. The EU also proposes an import quota of 400,000
tons for industrial sugar.  Under EU rules, local sugar producers can supply a limited
amount of sugar to the domestic market, and any surplus must be
exported or put to non-food use. The  World Trade Organization  in
2005 limited EU exports of subsidized sugar to 1.37 million tons
after a complaint by  Brazil ,  Australia  and  Thailand .  “With these measures, sugar operators received a strong
signal that it is attractive to grow and produce sugar,” the
commission said.  The EU has allowed the sale of 500,000 tons of out-of-quota
sugar on the domestic market this year to improve supplies, and
the total amount has been taken up by producers, the commission
said. The bloc also allowed extra imports of 300,000 tons of
sugar at zero duty.  The additional supply “will arrive in the next few months
to contribute to ease price pressures,” the commission said.  If the same market conditions arise during the next
marketing year, the commission would be ready to adopt
“exceptional measures similar to the ones implemented during
the present marketing year” to secure adequate supply for the
EU market, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
