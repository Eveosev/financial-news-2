The  New York Yankees  signed free
agent pitcher Kevin Millwood to a minor-league contract, Fox
Sports reported on its  website .  The 36-year-old right-hander has compiled a record of 159-
137 during his 14-year career with five teams.  The Yankees are returning three starting pitchers from last
season -- CC Sabathia, A.J. Burnett and  Phil Hughes . Sergio Mitre, who made three starts for the team last season, was
traded today for Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Chris Dickerson.  According to Fox, Millwood will have a chance to compete
with Ivan Nova, Freddy Garcia and Bartolo Colon for one of the
two remaining spots in the five-man rotation.  Millwood was 4-16 with a 5.10 earned-run average in 31
starts with the  Baltimore Orioles  last season. He can request to
be released if he isn’t named to the team’s 25-man opening day
roster, Fox said, citing an unidentified source.  Yankees spokesman Jason Latimer didn’t immediately respond
to a voicemail message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
