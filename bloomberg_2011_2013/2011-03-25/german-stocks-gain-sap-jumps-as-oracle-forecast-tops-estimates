German stocks rose, with the
benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  posting its biggest weekly increase in 10
months, as  SAP AG (SAP)  rallied after  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  boosted its
forecast.  SAP climbed 1.9 percent as rival Oracle forecast profit
that beat analysts’ estimates and HSBC Holdings Plc advised
buying the shares.  BASF SE (BAS)  gained as two people with knowledge
of the matter said the world’s biggest chemical company is in
talks with potential buyers of its fertilizer units.  The DAX rose 12.78, or 0.2 percent, to 6,946.36 at the 5:30
p.m. close in  Frankfurt , extending this week’s rally to 4.2
percent. The measure has gained 6.6 percent from this year’s low
on March 16 as investors speculated that the 12 percent slump
from Feb. 18 left German equities undervalued. The broader  HDAX
Index (HDAX)  gained 0.2 percent today.  “Equity markets edged higher today, capping an impressive
weekly rebound, choosing to focus on broker upgrades and upbeat
company results, and set aside concerns about  Japan ’s nuclear
reactors, as well as spreading unrest across the Middle East,”
Michael Hewson, a market analyst at CMC Markets in  London , wrote
in an e-mail.  German business confidence fell from a record high in
March. The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, declined to 111.1
from 111.3 in February, which was the highest reading since
records for a reunified Germany began in 1991. Economists had
predicted a drop to 110.5, according to the median of 39
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  SAP Extends Gain  SAP extended yesterday’s 2.8 percent gain, giving it the
biggest two-day advance since July 2009. Rival Oracle yesterday
forecast profit excluding acquisition costs and some other
expenses of 69 cents to 73 cents this quarter, surpassing the
66-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Oracle also posted earnings on the same basis of 54 cents a
share in the quarter that ended Feb. 28, exceeding analysts’
projections.  Separately, HSBC upgraded SAP shares to “overweight” from
“neutral” today.  BASF gained 1.1 percent to 59.03 euros. The German company,
based in Ludwigshafen, said earlier this month that it would
seek to sell the fertilizer businesses, which generate about 500
million euros ($703 million) in combined sales.  Gildemeister AG (GIL)  rallied 7 percent to 16.78 euros after the
machine-tool manufacturer said it will implement the previously
announced increase of its share capital, with the new shares
offered to shareholders for subscription at a 5:1 ratio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
