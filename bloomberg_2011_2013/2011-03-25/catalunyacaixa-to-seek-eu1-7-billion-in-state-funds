 CatalunyaCaixa, a grouping of
Spanish savings banks, will seek 1.7 billion euros in state
funds in order to increase its core capital ratio, the group
said in a statement on its website.  CatalunyaCaixa will study alternatives which will allow it
to attract investment from private investors that can substitute
aid from the bailout fund, known as the Frob, in the “medium
term,” according to the statement.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
