Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President Richard W. Fisher said he supports the idea of
dropping the central bank’s congressional mandate for achieving
full employment.  Such a mandate on jobs “puts us on a slippery, political
slope,” the regional bank chief, who votes on monetary policy
this year, said during a panel discussion today in Brussels.
“Personally, I would prefer a single mandate.”  The Fed has operated since the 1970s under a dual mandate
to promote  price stability  and full employment, and stripping
the jobs portion would leave the central bank focused solely on
inflation. Fisher is a critic of the Fed’s second round of
quantitative easing, and said earlier this week that no
additional monetary stimulus will be necessary after the central
bank completes its asset purchase program in June.  The Dallas regional bank president said “we will
complete” the current $600 billion Treasury purchase plan and
said “I am worried about inflation.”  Fisher, at a separate event earlier today, also said the
U.S. monetary policy is at risk of being over-extended and that
the central bank can’t be seen as “the instrument of the fiscal
authorities or other political authorities in the U.S.”  “We’ve done enough,” Fisher said at a luncheon hosted by
the Bruegel research institute. “We’re at risk of doing too
much.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
