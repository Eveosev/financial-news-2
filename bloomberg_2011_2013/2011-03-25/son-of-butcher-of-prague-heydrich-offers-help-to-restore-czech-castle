Heider Heydrich, a son of the high-
ranking Nazi official assassinated in  Prague  in 1942, offered to
help obtain financing to reconstruct Panenske Brezany Castle ,
 Cesky Rozhlas  reported late yesterday.  Heydrich, who recently visited the residential suburb about
20 kilometers (12 miles) outside Prague, offered village mayor
Libor Holik administrative help in arranging European Union
funding to refurbish the ruined castle, the radio station said,
citing the mayor. The Heydrichs resided in the castle during the
World War II.  Panenske Brezany  castle is used by a research institute and
the owner lacks money to convert the castle into a monument or a
museum to commemorate Czech resistance to the German occupation,
the radio said.  Reinhard Heydrich, who was called the “Butcher of Prague”
for his brutal policy toward the Czechs, was appointed Reich
Protector for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in
September 1941. He was assassinated May 27, 1942 by two
Czechoslovak soldiers trained by the British military and sent
by the Czechoslovak government in exile.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
