French growth accelerated more than
originally estimated in the fourth quarter, led by road
transport services as import growth weakened.  The economy expanded 0.4 percent from the third quarter,
when it grew 0.2 percent, national statistics office Insee in
Paris said today. It had previously estimated an expansion of
0.3 percent in that period. In 2010, gross domestic product rose
1.5 percent, in line with a previous estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
