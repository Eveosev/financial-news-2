World Trade Organization judges,
acting on a Canadian request, will decide whether a European
Union ban on trade in seal products breaks global rules.  Canada  asked for consultations with the EU in September
2007 after  Belgium  banned the manufacture and sale of all
products containing seal and the Netherlands prepared to take
similar action. The 27-nation EU closed its borders to all seal
products in August last year.  The Canadian government says the EU ban doesn’t contain an
exemption clause for products from seals that have been killed
humanely. Canada argues that scientific evidence shows the
country’s seal hunt follows what it calls “rigorous” standards
of animal welfare.  The value of Canada’s seal hunt in 2009 was about C$10
million ($10.2 million), down from C$35 million in 2006. Total
sales of seal products to  Europe  are worth $2.5 million,
according to the federal government, with as much as 90 percent
of that coming from exports to  Russia .  The EU today blocked a separate request by Norway for the
Geneva-based WTO to set up a panel to investigate the bloc’s ban
on seal products. Norway said on March 15 that its  consultations 
with the EU had failed to resolve the dispute. The EU can’t
block a second request, which is likely to come in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
