Japan â€™s Nuclear and Industrial
Safety Agency ordered Tokyo Electric Power Co. to improve
radiation monitoring at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant
after three workers were exposed to radiation yesterday.  The workers were contaminated after stepping in water with
radiation levels 10,000 higher than water used in reactor
cooling, Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the agency, said at
a briefing today.  The agency plans to replace the sea water being used to
cool the reactors with fresh water, as sea water contains
impurities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
