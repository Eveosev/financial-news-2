Airports Company  South Africa  may
post a loss of as much as 500 million rand ($73 million) for the
year through March due to delays in finalizing new tariffs,
 Business Report  said, citing Priscillah Mabelane, the companyâ€™s
finance director.  The industry regulator approved a tariff increase of 41
percent, less than the 133 percent state-owned ACSA had
requested, leading to the company challenging the decision, the
Johannesburg-base newspaper cited Mabelane as saying. A
government task team was appointed to look at the increase,
resulting in a delay, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
