Paxton Media Group LLC, a closely
held owner of community newspapers, canceled plans to borrow
$240 million to refinance existing loans, Moody’s Investors
Service said today in a report.  The transaction, proposed in October, included a $210
million  term loan  B due 2016, a $20 million term loan A due
2013, and a $10 million, five-year revolving line of credit,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Paxton Media, based in Paducah, Kentucky, had offered to
pay 5.5 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate on the term loan B and 4.5 percentage points more than the
lending benchmark on the term loan A.  Chief Financial Officer Richard Paxton didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.  A term loan A is sold mainly to banks while so-called B
loans are sold mainly to non-bank lenders such as collateralized
loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and  hedge funds . In a
revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again once it’s
repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  -- Editors: Chapin Wright, Faris Khan  To contact the reporter on this story:
