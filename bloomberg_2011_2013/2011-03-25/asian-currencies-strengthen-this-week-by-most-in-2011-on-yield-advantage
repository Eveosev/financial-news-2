Asian currencies strengthened this
week by the most in almost three months on speculation regional
central banks will increase  interest rates  further to curb
inflation, boosting yield premiums over developed nations.  Philippine policy makers joined China,  India ,  South Korea ,
 Indonesia  and Thailand in raising borrowing costs this year by
lifting the benchmark rate a quarter percentage point to 4.25
percent on March 24, the first increase in more than two years.
Overseas investors bought $793 million more Indonesian, South
Korean and Thai equities than they sold in the first four days
of this week, exchange data show. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
shares rallied the most this year during the week.  “Gains in stocks and yield differentials are encouraging
inflows of funds into the region, supporting the currencies,”
said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader in the Asian and emerging-
markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo .  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies, gained 0.6 percent from a
week earlier to 116.95 yesterday after touching 117.04, the
highest level since 1997. South Korea’s won climbed 1.1 percent
this week to 1,114.20 per dollar, India’s rupee jumped 1 percent
to 44.68 and Malaysia’s ringgit rose 0.8 percent to 3.0260,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Developing economies in Asia may grow 8.4 percent this
year, more than triple the 2.5 percent pace for advanced
economies, according to estimates by the  International Monetary
Fund  released in January. Benchmark policy rates in Indonesia
and India are 6.75 percent and South Korea’s borrowing costs are
3 percent, compared with a maximum of 0.25 percent in the U.S.
and  Japan .  Further Rate Increases  The Philippine peso completed a weekly gain after the
central bank signaled further rate increases may be needed to
tame inflation. The currency strengthened 0.9 percent to 43.31
per dollar.  “The peso reacted positively to the rate increase,” said
Marcelo Ayes, a Manila-based senior vice president at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. “Overall, risk appetite has
improved.”  The won touched 1,112.65 yesterday, the strongest level
since Feb. 21, as foreign investors bought a net $601 million of
South Korean stocks this week through March 24, according to
exchange data. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index climbed 3.9 percent
this week.  Malaysia  Inflation  Malaysia’s ringgit rose to a 13-year high and had its first
weekly advance in three as a report yesterday showed consumer
prices in Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy rose 2.9
percent in February from a year earlier, the most since April
2009. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists
was for a gain of 2.7 percent.  “Inflation is rising across the region while economic
growth in Asia remains resilient,” said Sim Moh Siong, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd.
“Therefore we can expect the tightening cycle in Malaysia to
continue.”  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah advanced 0.6 percent for the
week to 8,714 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to NT$29.488,
 China ’s yuan gained 0.18 percent to 6.5576 and the Thai baht
added 0.2 percent to 30.26. Singapore’s currency strengthened
1.2 percent to S$1.2608.  To contact the reporter on this story:
