European Central Bank council
member  Guy Quaden  said a “moderate” increase in interest
rates, starting from a low base, won’t stifle the economic
recovery,  L’Echo  newspaper reported, citing an interview.  “While an interest rate of 1 percent was appropriate two
years ago, it is hard to maintain that it still is now that
economic growth and inflation have become significantly positive
again,” Quaden said. “A moderate increase of interest rates,
starting from a base level that is also low, will not hamper the
economic recovery.”  Quaden, who leaves his post as Belgian central bank chief
at the end of this month to be succeeded by Luc Coene, told the
newspaper he backed a call to begin with a “normalization” of
 interest rates  at the most recent meeting of the ECB’s governing
council in  Frankfurt . Euro-area inflation has been above the
central bank’s 2 percent limit since December and ECB President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  this month said policy makers may raise the
benchmark rate in April from a record low of 1 percent.  Speaking about the health of Belgian banks, Quaden told the
newspaper that financial institutions haven’t been completely
stabilized “because of the interaction between the balance-
sheet issues of sovereign states and those of the banks.” The
aim of the next round of stress tests is “to verify their
solidity,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
