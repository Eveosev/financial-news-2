Wheat production in the European
Union, the world’s largest growing region, is set to climb 2.3
percent this year on rising yields in  Germany  and the U.K.,
Copa-Cogeca said.  The overall EU wheat crop will rise to 138 million metric
tons from 134.9 million tons in 2010, the Brussels-based farm
group predicted in a  report  on its website today. Rising
productivity in some of the bloc’s largest growers of the grain
will more than compensate for lower plantings in Italy and the
 Czech Republic , based on Copa-Cogeca’s estimates.  Milling-wheat futures jumped 87 percent in the past year in
Paris trading as drought in  Russia  and flooding in  Canada ,
Germany and  Australia  reduced supply. Rising production costs
will limit farmers’ response to higher prices, according to
Copa-Cogeca.  “Producers are being squeezed by high input costs,” the
group said. “Forecasts for this season show only a slight rise
in EU wheat production of 2.3 percent, as producers are faced
with high production costs and slow yield-growth rates.”  Overall wheat planting will slide 0.8 percent to 25.6
million hectares (63.4 million acres), Copa-Cogeca said.  Reduced Sowing  The EU harvest of soft wheat, used in bread, baked goods
and  animal feed , will climb 2.7 percent to 129.7 million tons,
according to the forecast. Planting will slip 0.4 percent to
22.9 million hectares, it shows.  Copa-Cogeca’s outlook compares with a January forecast by
the European Commission for a 2011 soft-wheat crop of 131.9
million tons produced from 23.5 million hectares.  France , the largest EU grower, will reap 35.8 million tons
of soft wheat, 0.3 percent more than in 2010, while the German
crop is estimated to rise 2.6 percent to 24.6 million tons on
higher yields, the farm group said. U.K. soft-wheat production
will jump 6.3 percent to 15.8 million tons, Copa-Cogeca said.  Output of durum wheat, the hard variety used to make pasta
and couscous, will drop 3.6 percent to 8.3 million tons,
according to the farm group.  EU barley production is forecast to climb 0.6 percent to
53.4 million tons, while corn production may advance 6.9 percent
to 59.1 million tons, Copa-Cogeca said.  Italy , the EU’s second-
largest corn grower after France, will boost production of the
grain to 8.97 million tons in 2011 from 7.75 million tons, the
group estimated.  The rapeseed crop in the 27-nation bloc is forecast to rise
to 20.2 million tons from 19.7 million tons, while sunflower-
seed harvesting may advance to 7.32 million tons from 6.77
million tons, according to Copa-Cogeca.  To contact the reporter on this story:
