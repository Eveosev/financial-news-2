DCP Midstream LLC, a privately
owned gas-gathering and processing company, shut a pipeline in
Jefferson County,  Texas , after a  power outage  knocked its Port
Arthur gas processing plant offline, according to Roz Elliott, a
company spokeswoman.  The shutdown today “caused a relief valve to operate as it
should and release,” Elliot, based at company headquarters in
Denver, said in a telephone interview.  “We are in the process of bringing gas volumes back
online, and are processing 130 million cubic feet a day,”
Elliot said.  The processing plant is expected to be back at normal rates
later today, according to Elliott. There were “very, very minor
curtailments for just a few hours,” she said.  The plant has a capacity of 200 million cubic feet a day,
according to a company  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
