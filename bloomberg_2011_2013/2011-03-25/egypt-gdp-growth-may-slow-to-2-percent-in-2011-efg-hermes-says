Egypt ’s gross domestic product
growth may slow to as little as 2 percent this year after
tourists fled and companies closed following demonstrations that
ousted President  Hosni Mubarak , according to the country’s
biggest publicly traded investment bank.  “We expect GDP growth will go down to 2 or 3 percent this
year,” Yasser El Mallawany, co-chief executive officer of EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE, said in an interview in London today.
“These are very tough times.”  El Mallawany was in London for EFG’s annual Egypt Capital
Markets conference, promoting investment in the country after a
popular revolt against the former regime shut the bourse for
almost two months. EFG expects mergers and acquisitions and
shares to rise as the markets stabilize later this year, El
Mallawany said.  Egypt’s GDP increased 16.2 percent last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The country’s benchmark EGX30 Index
of shares has dropped 31 percent this year, compared with a 15
percent advance in 2010.  Finance Minister Samir Radwan told investors at the
conference that the new government is “pro-business, pro-
private sector and will not increase the rate of taxes,” El
Mallawany said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
