Illovo Sugar Ltd. (ILV)  may decide to
produce biofuels from sugarcane if it makes commercial sense
under forthcoming South African guidelines, Business Day
reported, citing Managing Director Graham Clark.  Illovo will wait for an announcement on regulated
bioethanol and biodiesel prices from the  Department of Energy 
later this month before making a decision, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper said, citing Clark.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
