Portugal ’s debt was downgraded two
notches by  Standard & Poor’s  Ratings Services, following a cut
by  Fitch Ratings  yesterday, after the country’s prime minister
resigned when lawmakers rejected his austerity measures.  Standard & Poor’s lowered the nation’s long-term sovereign
credit rating to BBB from A-. The long- and short-term ratings
remain on negative credit watch, the company said in a March 24
statement. Portugal has continued to rule out a rescue after the
parliament’s rejection of budget cuts led Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  to offer to quit.  “The resulting increased political uncertainty could hurt
market confidence and heighten Portugal’s refinancing risk,”
said Standard & Poor’s analysts led by London-based Eileen
Zhang. “In our view, it is likely to take at least two months
to both hold elections and to form a new government.”  Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos on March 11
presented additional deficit-cutting measures equal to 4.5
percent of gross domestic product over three years, including a
reduction in pensions of more than 1,500 euros ($2,125)  a month
and cuts in tax benefits. The measures were rejected two days
ago in parliament by opposition parties.  President Anibal Cavaco Silva said March 23 that he will
meet the main parties today and the government will retain its
powers until he accepts Socrates’s resignation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
