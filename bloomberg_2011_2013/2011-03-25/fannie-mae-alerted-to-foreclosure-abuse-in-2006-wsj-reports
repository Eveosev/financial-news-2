Fannie Mae  was alerted to abuses by
lenders and their law firms of the foreclosure system in 2006,
long before official investigations began, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing an internal report by the government-
controlled agency.  The report said foreclosure attorneys in Florida had tried
to speed up the process by routinely making false statementds in
court; it also raised questions over the legal standing of some
mortgage servicers, the newspaper said.  An unidentified Fannie Mae spokeswoman said the agency had
addressed the issued raised in the 2006 report and regularly
monitored the behavior of lawyers, the WSJ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
