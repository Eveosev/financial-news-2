Statoil ASA (STL)  halted production from
its Brage platform on Monday because of a rust hole in the
flaring pipe, Dagens Naeringsliv reported, citing
company spokesman Ola Anders Skauby.    Production is expected to start again “relatively
quickly,” he told the Oslo-based newspaper.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
