The  Ivory Coast  is “close to civil
war” as forces loyal to the country’s two rival presidents
battle in the streets of the capital, Abidjan,  France ’s
Ambassador to the United Nations,  Gerard Araud , said today in
 New York .  The UN Security Council is meeting to consider a French
resolution that would let UN peacekeepers use “all necessary
measures” to protect civilians, according to diplomats who
spoke on condition of anonymity.  Battles between supporters of incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  and the internationally recognized victor of the Nov. 28
election, Alassane Outtara, have caused “a collapse of law and
order” in the capital, Araud said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
