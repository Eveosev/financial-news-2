The  Federal Reserve  didn’t seek to
drain reserves from the banking system today with tri-party
reverse repurchase agreements.  Bloomberg News sent a story earlier today saying the
central bank was conducting the operations. The Fed said March
23 that it would resume the transactions, part of a series of
open-market operations that began in 2009, to prepare for the
eventual withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The central bank
drained $310 million in reserves yesterday with three-day tri-
party reverse repos.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties. The central bank added more than $1
trillion in extra cash to its balance sheet as part of its
effort to combat the financial crisis.  In a tri-party arrangement, a third party functions as the
agent for the transaction and holds the security as collateral.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. are the
only banks that serve in a trade-clearing capacity in the tri-
party repo market.  The central bank has drained $7.16 billion in reserves from
the banking system through tri-party reverse repos since it
began what it calls “readiness exercises” in 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
