Japan  may urge the voluntary
evacuation of people living within a 20-kilometer (12 mile) to
30-kilometer radius near the damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
power plant, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said.  While people living within a 20 kilometer radius were
evacuated after the March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami,
people living within 20-30 kilometers were urged to stay inside.  The possibility of expanding the evacuation radius is
because of the difficulty in getting supplies to the area and
not because of a rise in radiation levels, Edano said at a press
conference today in Tokyo. The government will continue to aid
people who remain in the area, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
