U.S. nuclear-power output fell 0.8
percent as  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW)  slowed the Paolo Verde 1
reactor in Arizona, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  said.  Power generation nationwide decreased by 703 megawatts from
yesterday to 84,690 megawatts, or 83 percent of capacity,
according to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Seventeen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Pinnacle West reduced output from the 1,335-megawatt Palo
Verde 1 to 60 percent of capacity from full power yesterday.
Units 2 and 3, which have the same capacities as Unit 1, are
operating at full power. The plant is about 45 miles (72
kilometers) west of Phoenix.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  decreased output its 852-megawatt FitzPatrick
reactor in New York to 86 percent of capacity from full power
yesterday. The plant is 6 miles northeast of Oswego.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  boosted the 1,130-
megawatt Salem 2 reactor in New Jersey to 85 percent of capacity
from 75 percent yesterday. The 1,174-megawatt Salem 1 fell to 94
percent of capacity from full power yesterday. The plant is
about 18 miles south of Wilmington, Delaware.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
