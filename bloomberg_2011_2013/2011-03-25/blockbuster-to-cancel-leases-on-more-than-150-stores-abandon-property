Blockbuster Inc. (BLOAQ)  the bankrupt
movie-rental chain, intends to cancel leases on more than 150
U.S. stores and abandon any property left in the buildings to
the landlords.  Blockbuster, based in Dallas, listed the leases it plans to
cancel in two motions filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
in Manhattan. Such announcements usually mean a retailer plans
to either close the store associated with the lease or attempt
to renegotiate its rent.  Any property left in the stores “shall be deemed
abandoned,” Blockbuster said in the motions. The company listed
stores in more than a dozen states, including  New York , Texas,
California, Florida and Illinois.  Blockbuster, once the world’s largest movie-rental chain,
won permission this month to sell itself at auction after
receiving a $290 million bid from  hedge funds .  The company filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 23 and had been
locked in dispute with movie studios and other unsecured
creditors about whether it can sell its assets to hedge funds
that loaned Blockbuster money to operate in bankruptcy.  Blockbuster began reorganizing with 5,600 stores, including
3,300 in the U.S. The bankruptcy petition listed assets of $1.02
billion and debt of $1.47 billion.  After bankruptcy, Blockbuster rejected about 220 leases for
stores that were closing. Blockbuster said it would shut 72
additional stores by the end of 2010 and about 110 more this
quarter.  The case is In re Blockbuster, 10-14997, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
