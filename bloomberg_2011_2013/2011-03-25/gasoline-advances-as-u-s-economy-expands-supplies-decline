Gasoline rose a fifth consecutive
day as growth in the  U.S. economy  indicated that demand for the
motor fuel may increase while inventories are dropping.  Futures gained after the Commerce Department reported that
gross domestic product expanded at a 3.1 percent annual rate in
the fourth quarter, more than the 2.8 percent estimate issued
last month. Gasoline stockpiles fell a fifth consecutive time to
an 11-week low last week, the Energy Department said March 23.  “GDP met the expectations and that probably provided some
support,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “And we seem to have
a little more strength in gasoline because we’ve seen more than
20 million barrels wiped out in the stockpiles.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 0.69 cent to $3.0517 a
gallon at 9:42 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
touched $3.0617, the highest intraday level since March 7.  Gasoline inventories have shrunk 21.4 million barrels in
five straight weeks of declines, according to department data.  Heating oil for April delivery added 0.29 cent to $3.0649 a
gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1
cent to $3.561 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
