Agfa-Gevaert NV (AGFB) ,  Europe ’s largest
maker of prepress products, said fourth-quarter profit rose 60
percent as financing costs fell because of lower debt following
a stock sale to existing investors and the sale of receivables.  Fourth-quarter net income climbed to 32 million euros ($45
million), or 21 cents a share, from 20 million euros, or 16
cents, a year earlier, the Mortsel, Belgium-based company said
today in a statement. Sales rose 9.7 percent to 806 million
euros, matching preliminary figures reported on Feb. 24.  Agfa got net proceeds of 141 million euros from a 1-for-3
rights offering and generated an additional 34 million euros of
cash from a reduction of receivables in the fourth quarter,
cutting net debt to 161 million euros. Its gross margin, or the
proportion of revenue left after costs of goods sold, narrowed
0.8 percentage point to 32.4 percent as silver rallied to more
than $30 a troy ounce in December. Agfa reiterated the impact
will become “more substantial” in the current quarter.  “We expect higher metal prices to knock 184 million euros
of recurring earnings before interest and tax off Agfa’s income
statement in 2011,” Arnaud Goossens, an analyst at Exane BNP
Paribas in Brussels, wrote in a note published on March 9. He
has an “underperform” rating on the stock.  Goossens said he doesn’t expect Agfa’s silver consumption
to increase from about 475 metric tons last year, based on
contacts with management, and estimates Agfa can pass on about
40 percent of the higher silver price to customers.  Every one-dollar advance in spot silver cuts Agfa’s
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization by
12 million euros annually, Agfa said in the prospectus of its
rights offering. Agfa stopped hedging silver purchases at an
undisclosed time last year, according to the document.  Silver averaged $31.60 an ounce so far this year, compared
with $20.20 for all of last year, and rose to as high as
$38.165, the highest level since 1980, yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
