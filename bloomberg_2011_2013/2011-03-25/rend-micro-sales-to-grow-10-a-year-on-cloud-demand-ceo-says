(Corrects headline and first paragraph of article published
March 25 to show that CEO is giving a personal goal.)  Trend Micro Inc. (4704)  Chief Executive
Officer Eva Chen said she hopes for the security-software
maker’s revenue to increase by at least 10 percent over the
longer term a year as demand grows from an expanding cloud
computing.  Business demand will grow as protection against data
manipulation and viruses becomes crucial in cloud computing,
Chen said in an interview in  Tokyo  yesterday. Cloud computing is
a network where files are stored or processes are conducted
remotely rather than on a personal computer. Trend Micro
reported full-year revenue of 95.4 billion yen ($1.18 billion)
last year and net income was 12.7 billion yen. The company has
not disclosed its earnings outlook for this year.  “It’s not enough to place a security system at the
doorstep,” said Chen. “Each individual and server that
connects to the  data center  needs to implement security.” Chen
expects more security demand from users of smart phones and
tablet computers.  The global server security business has an estimated market
worth $30.1 billion, according to Trend Micro. The company has
the highest market share at 23 percent, according to research
company  IDC Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
