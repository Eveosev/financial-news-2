Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga 
is the country’s most popular presidential candidate and would
win 33 percent of the vote if an election were held today,
according to a poll conducted by  TNS Research International .  Deputy Prime Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  is the second most-
popular and would receive 14 percent of ballots, while Vice
President Kalonzo Musyoka and suspended Higher Education
Minister William Ruto would each get 12 percent, the company
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday from Nairobi, the
capital.  Odinga has been the most popular presidential candidate
since October 2009, it said.  TNS interviewed 1,010 people in the survey that was
conducted between Feb. 21 and March 4, according to the
statement. It didn’t give a margin of error.  President Mwai Kibaki, whose second term of office ends
next year, isn’t eligible for re-election. A presidential vote
is scheduled for Aug. 14, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
