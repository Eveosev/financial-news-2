New Zealand upset  South Africa  by
49 runs in the quarterfinals of the Cricket World Cup as Jacob Oram took four wickets, and Ross Taylor and Jesse Ryder combined
for 114 runs.  The Kiwis elected to bat after winning the toss and reached
221-8 at the end of their 50 overs. Ryder put on 83 runs and
Taylor reached 43, with both their wickets taken by Imran Tahir,
who was 2-32. Morne Morkel was 3-46 for South Africa.  The total looked difficult to defend in the day-night match
at Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur,  Bangladesh . South Africa,
the second favorite behind tournament co-host India, was bowled
out for 172 as Oram took 4-39.  “We would have liked a few more, but we knew this score
was going to be competitive,”  New Zealand ’s Nathan McCullum,
who took three wickets, said after the match. “Our guys showed
some guts and determination to get through a difficult period.”  After South African opener Hashim Amla was out for 7,
captain Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis combined for 61 runs,
and it looked like the chase would be short. But the Proteas
failed to build another partnership as six wickets went for 38
runs. Kallis was out for 47, leaving South Africa on 108-3. When
Dale Steyn was caught on 8, South Africa was 146-8.  “It’s very difficult to explain how you feel right now,”
Smith said in the post-match interview. “There are really no
words to describe it, so we just have to take it on the chin.”  Earlier this week, U.K. bookmaker Ladbrokes had South
Africa as a 7-2 chance, meaning a successful $2 bet would bring
in $7 and the original stake. Only  India , at 3-1, had better
odds. New Zealand was the longshot of the eight teams left in
the quarterfinals, at 20-1.  New Zealand will play the winner of tomorrow’s England-Sri
Lanka quarterfinal for a place in the final.  Pakistan  meets
India in the other semifinal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
