Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d., the
Slovenian drinks company that’s selling 23.3 percent of  Mercator
Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., will announce results of bidding for the
stake by the end of the month, STA reported, citing Pivovarna
Chief Executive Officer Dusan Zorko.  The price offered won’t be the only criteria taken into
account although it remains important considering the company’s
liquidity problems, Zorko told the newswire. He added that there
would have to be strong arguments for a sale not to proceed, STA
reported.  Pivovarna Lasko has about 400 million euros of debt ($567
million), 70 percent of which is in short-term loans, the news
service said.  Agrokor d.d. of  Croatia , Warburg Pincus LLC and Mid Europa
Partners Ltd. placed bids for the stake of Mercator retailer on
March 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
