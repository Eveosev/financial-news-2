KenolKobil Ltd., a fuel retailer
with operations in seven African nations, rose the most in
almost two weeks after saying full-year profit grew 38 percent
and forecasting “double-digit” first-half earnings growth.  Shares in KenolKobil,  Kenya ’s biggest fuel retailer by
market value, gained 20 cents, or 2.2 percent, to 9.5 shillings
by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the biggest jump since March 14.  “The positive outlook of the company could generate
increased interest in the stock,” Nairobi-based Sterling
Investment Bank Ltd. said in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The company also has operations in Uganda, Tanzania,
 Rwanda , Burundi, Zambia and Ethiopia. In November, the company
said it planned to begin operations in Zimbabwe and Mozambique
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
