O’Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY)  agreed to
pay $20.9 million to resolve a U.S.  Justice Department  probe of
a scheme to manipulate earnings and double bill at CSK Auto
Corp. before O’Reilly bought it in 2008.  CSK accepted responsibility for the illegal conduct of its
former employees, and as part of the agreement neither company
will face further prosecution, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Justice Department today. According to the
non-prosecution agreement, former CSK employees misstated
earnings at the company from 2001 to 2006, the Justice
Department said.  The investigation has produced guilty pleas from three
former CSK employees, according to the statement. In May, former
CSK Auto Corp. Chief Financial Officer Don W. Watson pleaded
guilty in  Arizona  federal court to fraud charges. Watson, of
Gilbert, Arizona, admitted that he and others claimed tens of
millions of dollars in false vendor rebates as income.  Edward W. O’Brien III, CSK’s former controller, and Gary M. Opper, the company’s ex-director of credits and receivables,
pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice, the U.S. said.  Mark Merz, a spokesman for Springfield, Missouri-based
O’Reilly, declined to comment on the agreement.  The case is U.S. v. Fraser, 09-cr-00372, U.S. District
Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix).  To contact the reporter on this story:
