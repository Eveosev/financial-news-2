India ’s crude oil output increased
12 percent in February, rising for the 15th straight month,
after production by non-state companies including  Cairn India
Ltd. (CAIR)  surged.  Asia ’s second-biggest energy consumer pumped 2.99 million
metric tons of oil in February compared with 2.66 million tons a
year earlier, the  oil ministry  said in a statement today.  Production by non-state explorers climbed 88 percent to
834,200 tons. Output from Rajasthan state, the site of the
country’s biggest onshore oil deposit operated by Cairn India,
surged more than eightfold to 488,900 tons, according to the
data. Cairn India started output at the field in August 2009.  State-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the nation’s largest
energy explorer, produced 1.86 million tons of oil, a drop of
4.1 percent from a year earlier, according to the ministry.  Output at ONGC’s Mumbai High fields declined 6.1 percent to
1.28 million tons. The fields, 100 miles (160 kilometers)
northwest of Mumbai in the  Arabian Sea , account for 43 percent
of India’s oil production.  Oil India Ltd. (OINL) , the second-biggest state-run crude
producer, reported a 4.7 percent increase in output to 290,800
tons, according to the statement.  India is Asia’s third-largest oil producer, behind  China 
and  Indonesia , according to the BP Statistical Review of World
Energy.  Natural gas output in India fell for the third straight
month, declining 7.3 percent to 3.91 billion cubic meters,
according to the data.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s biggest company by market
value, cut production from the country’s biggest gas field off
the east coast from a maximum level of 60 million standard cubic
meters a day because of reduced pressure in the reservoir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
