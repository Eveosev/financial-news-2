Japan  will push ahead with plans
announced in 2008 to double aid to  Africa  by next year, even
after a tsunami and earthquake hit the Asian country, the Daily
News reported, citing Japanese Ambassador Hiroshi Nakagawa.  Japan’s support to Tanzania increased to $250 million in
2010 from $143 million in 2009 and $80 million in 2008, the Dar
se Salaam-based newspaper said.  The Japanese government estimates it will cost $300 billion
to recover from the earthquake, Nakagawa said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
