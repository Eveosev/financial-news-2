Indian stocks rallied, with the
benchmark index posting its biggest weekly gain in 20 months, as
speculation that global economic recovery will be sustained
spurred gains in equities across  Asia . Software makers jumped.  Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO) , the nation’s second-largest
software-services provider, climbed 5.3 percent, the most since
July 2009. Asian stocks increased, tracking a rally in U.S.
equities, after U.S. initial jobless claims data signaled the
labor market in the largest economy is mending.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the
third-biggest, advanced 3.7 percent.  Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd. (TCS) , the largest, added 2.4 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
surged 464.90, or 2.5 percent, to 18,815.64 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, the highest level in two months. The guage
jumped 5.2 percent this week, the most since the period ended
July 17, 2009. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange rose 2.4 percent to 5,654.25. The BSE 200 Index
increased 2 percent to 2,310.58.  “Investors are expecting Indian software companies to
benefit from the recovery in the  U.S. economy ,” R.K. Gupta,
managing director of Taurus Asset Management Ltd., said by phone
from  New Delhi .  India ’s biggest software exporters get about
half of their revenue from the U.S.  Regional Gains  Asian equities rose, with the region’s benchmark MSCI Asia
Pacific Index posting its biggest weekly gain since November.
The U.S. Labor Department figures showed the number of Americans
filing applications for  unemployment benefits  fell 5,000 to
382,000 last week. Data on the economy, consumption and  consumer
confidence  are due today.  Technology exporters across Asia rallied after forecasts at
Oracle Corp., the U.S.-based supplier of  database software , and
 Accenture Plc (ACN) , the second-largest technology-consulting company,
topped analyst estimates.  Infosys climbed 5.3 percent to 3,163.05 rupees. Wipro rose
3.7 percent to 455.9 rupees, the most in more than a month,
while Tata Consultancy added 2.4 percent to 1,119.65 rupees.  “It’s a sentimental reaction on hope that the Indian
software firms will get more orders,” said Ambareesh Baliga,
chief operating officer of Way2Wealth Securities.  The Sensex is the world’s worst-performer this year after
benchmark indexes Egypt, Tunisia and Kuwait, as concerns that
rising interest rates will crimp economic growth and corporate
earnings have dragged stocks lower. Companies on the Sensex
trade at an average 17.7 times estimated earnings, compared with
21.5 times in March 2010, after the gauge dropped 8.3 percent
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Attractive Valuations’  “Money waiting on the sidelines is now finding its way
into Indian stocks as valuations have come down to attractive
levels,” Mumbai-based Prateek Agrawal, head of equity at Bharti
AXA Investment Managers Pvt. which managed 4.12 billion rupees
($92.3 million) in assets at the end of December, said by phone.
He favors shares of “large-cap software” companies, lenders
and automakers.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the nation’s biggest real estate developer,
rallied 6.4 percent to 249.1 rupees, the steepest gain among
Sensex stocks.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the country’s biggest
engineering company, gained 3.1 percent to 1598.4 rupees.  Overseas funds bought a net 3.93 billion rupees ($87.5
million) of Indian stocks on March 23, paring their outflow from
equities this year to 73.9 billion rupees, according to the
 website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  India’s economic expansion and corporate earnings lured
foreign investors to purchase a record $29.4 billion of local
equities last year and made the Sensex the best performer and
most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  -- With assistance from Hemal Savai in Mumbai. Editor: Ravil
