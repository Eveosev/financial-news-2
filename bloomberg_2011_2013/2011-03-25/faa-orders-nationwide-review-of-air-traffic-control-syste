U.S. aviation regulators  are
reviewing procedures and equipment to prevent a repeat of an
incident in which planes landed while a controller slept.  Pilots will be reminded they can divert elsewhere when they
get no response at an airport, the  Federal Aviation
Administration  said. Controllers at radar facilities will
contact 30 towers staffed with a single worker after midnight to
ensure they are prepared to handle a flight, the agency said.  “I am determined to make sure we do not repeat Wednesday’s
unacceptable event,” FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in a
statement today.  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American Airlines and  United Continental
Holdings Inc. (UAL) ’s United Airlines planes carrying a combined 154
passengers landed without tower assistance after midnight on
March 23 at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after
failing to make contact with a controller, who later told
investigators he had fallen asleep.  To contact the reporter for this story:
