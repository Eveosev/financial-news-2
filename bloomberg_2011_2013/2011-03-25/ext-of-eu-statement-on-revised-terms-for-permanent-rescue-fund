Following is the text of a European
Union statement on the revised financing for the European
Stability Mechanism, the permanent aid mechanism due to start in
2013. It was read out by EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  in a
press conference. A printed text wasn’t immediately available.  “The ESM will have a total subscribed capital of 700
billion euros. Of this amount, 80 billion will be in the form of
paid-in capital provided by the euro-area member states being
phased in from July 2013 in five equal annual installments.  “In addition, the ESM will also dispose of a combination
of committed callable capital and of guarantees from euro-area
member states to a total amount of 620 billion euros.  “During the transitory phase from 2013 to 2017, member
states commit to accelerate, in the unlikely event that this is
needed, the provision of appropriate instruments in order to
maintain a minimum 15 percent ratio between paid-in capital and
the outstanding amount of ESM issuance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
