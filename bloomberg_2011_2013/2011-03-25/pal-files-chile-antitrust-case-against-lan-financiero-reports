Chile’s Pal Airlines filed an
antitrust complaint against  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) , Latin America’s
biggest carrier by market value, and asked authorities to reject
Lan’s planned takeover of  Brazil ’s  Tam SA. (TAMM4)   In a case lodged with Chile’s competition tribunal, Pal
said Lan lowered fares from Santiago to Cordoba,  Argentina , to
46,075 pesos ($96) in September when Pal was preparing to start
flights on the same route from 436,850 pesos in April.  The reduced prices were below cost and represent a
“predatory practice,” Pal wrote in a statement distributed
today by e-mail. Officials in Lan Airlines’ press department
didn’t answer phone calls made after trading hours or return an
e-mailed request for comment.  Pal also asked the competition tribunal, known as the TDLC,
to reject the planned takeover of Tam on grounds that it will
reduce competition, it said in the statement.  The TDLC halted the proposed tie-up as it reviews the
transaction at the request of a consumer group. Lan will
collaborate with the tribunal’s review, which the Santiago-based
carrier hopes will be completed by the end of second quarter,
Lan said in an e-mailed statement March 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
