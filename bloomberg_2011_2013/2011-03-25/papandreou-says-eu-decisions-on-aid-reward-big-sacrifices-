Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou comments on European Union leaders’ approval of a
permanent debt-crisis mechanism for euro-area countries starting
in 2013.  Papandreou spoke to reporters today in Brussels after the
EU summit, which also affirmed March 11 decisions to ease the
terms of emergency aid that  Greece  received in return for budget
cuts and to bolster the role of the temporary European Financial
Stability Facility.  “The message is that the European Union is committed to
support the euro zone and the euro zone’s countries by any
means. This is a very strong commitment.”  “We made big sacrifices. The efforts are today recognized
by all European partners. The efforts have delivered results.”  “We need time, but we are committed to put Greece on a new
path, on a modern path.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
