Warren Buffett ’s $9 billion offer
for  Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  halted the chemical company’s pursuit of a
“large potential acquisition” that  Citigroup Inc. (C)  was helping
to evaluate.  “Lubrizol was in the process of evaluating a number of
potential acquisitions, including one large potential
acquisition” when Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  came
forward with its bid, the Wickliffe, Ohio-based firm said today
in a regulatory filing. Lubrizol didn’t name companies.  Buffett, the 80-year-old Berkshire chairman and chief
executive officer, is getting Lubrizol at the cheapest price for
a specialty chemicals company in 12 years, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The deal, announced on March 14, is subject to
shareholder approval. Lubrizol, the world’s largest producer of
lubricant additives, said in October it was seeking purchases to
improve profit margins.  David Sokol , head of Berkshire’s energy and luxury flight
businesses, initiated talks with Lubrizol CEO James Hambrick in
January, according to the filing. Buffett offered $135 a share
on Feb. 8. On March 2, he rejected a Lubrizol request to
increase the bid to $140 a share.  Lubrizol, which had been using New York-based Citigroup and
Evercore Group LLC to evaluate deals, instructed its advisers to
consider Berkshire’s interest in the firm.  Internal forecasts by Lubrizol show the company expects
revenue to rise 34 percent over five years to $7.32 billion,
according to the filing. Adjusted earnings may climb to $18.18 a
share in 2015 from $10.10 last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
