French  consumer confidence  fell to
an eight-month low in March as surging energy costs sapped
spending power and President Nicolas Sarkozy readied a new
wealth tax.  An index of sentiment fell to 83 from 85 in February,
national statistics office Insee said today in an e-mailed
statement. That was the lowest reading since July.  With  oil prices  up more than 40 percent in a year, French
motorists are paying more for gasoline while the government is
planning electricity-price increases for later this year. That’s
slashing spending power at a time when joblessness remains stuck
near a seven-year high.  Sarkozy’s government is preparing an overhaul of a tax on
the nation’s wealthiest households and the anti-immigration
National Front is surging in opinion polls.  “The higher oil price, combined with the current political
climate and an impending  tax reform  concerning affluent
households” are weighing on sentiment, said Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
