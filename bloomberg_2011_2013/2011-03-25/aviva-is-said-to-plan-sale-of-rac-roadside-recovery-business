Aviva Plc (AV/) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest insurer by market value, plans to sell its roadside
recovery service as it focuses on strengthening its main
businesses, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The insurer appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co., which is also
its corporate broker, to manage the sale of  RAC , said the
person, who declined to be named because the talks are private.
The deal is in its early stages, the person said.  Aviva is focusing on investing in 12 key markets and will
“de-emphasize” some of the other 18 areas in which it operates
over the next year, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Moss said
earlier this month. The insurer last year rejected a 5 billion-
pound ($8.1 billion) bid for the whole of its non-life insurance
division from U.K. rival  RSA Insurance Group Plc. (RSA)   Aviva spokeswoman Rashmi Gautam declined to comment.
JPMorgan spokeswoman Kate Haywood also declined to comment. The
story was previously reported by the Insurance Times.  Aviva’s then CEO Richard Harvey bought RAC in 2005 for
1.2 billion pounds, including debt and the company’s pension
plan. The insurer has since shed parts of the unit including its
windscreen repair and driving school businesses, which were both
sold to Arques Industries AG in 2008 and 2009, respectively.  Aviva climbed 2.3 pence, or 0.5 percent, to 433.9 pence
at 10:23 a.m. in London trading, valuing the firm at about
12.2 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
