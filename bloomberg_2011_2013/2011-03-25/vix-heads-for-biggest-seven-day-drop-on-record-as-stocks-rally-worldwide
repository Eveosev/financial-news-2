The benchmark measure of U.S. stock
options fell a seventh day in the longest streak since July, as
the economy grew faster than previously reported and concern
that the Japanese earthquake will curb growth eased.  The VIX, as the  Chicago  Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell 0.5 percent to 17.91 at 4:15 p.m. New York
time. Earlier today it slid as low as 17.07, a 42 percent drop
since March 16, the most over seven days for the two-decade old
index. The measure ended the day down 39 percent from the March
high, the biggest decline in the same number of days since
November 2008.  Stocks globally have rallied seven consecutive days,
driving the MSCI All-Country World Index of shares in 45 nations
up 5.1 percent. The VIX, which measures the cost of using
options as protection from losses in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, had jumped to 29.40 after the magnitude-9 quake in  Japan 
on March 11 and resulting tsunami and crisis at a nuclear plant
135 miles (217 kilometers) north of  Tokyo . It has averaged 20.38
in its two-decade history.  “I’ve never seen such a change in tone,” said Christopher Rich, head options strategist at JonesTrading Institutional
Services LLC in Chicago, who has been trading options for more
than 30 years. “Last week, everything was about Japan and
nuclear reactors, and this week it’s back to no fear. The market
and the media perception of this is that it was important one
week and not as much the next.”  Economic Growth  The S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent to 1,313.80 today after the
Commerce Department said the world’s biggest economy grew at a
3.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, more than the
original 2.8 percent estimate.  The stock market’s decline from this year’s peak in
February caused shorter-term risk gauges such as the VIX and
options volume to jump even as prices for longer-term assets
such as credit-default swaps and long-term  S&P 500  puts saw
smaller moves, according to a report today from New York-based
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “This shows that investors believe recent events in the
Middle East and Japan are unlikely to have a large and lasting
negative effect on global growth,” wrote John Marshall and Krag “Buzz” Gregory, options strategists at Goldman Sachs. “In one
month, the VIX rose from 15 to 29, but it only took 6 days for
the VIX to recede to a close of 18 yesterday.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
