Representatives of rebels fighting
forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi failed to arrive at a meeting
organized by the  African Union  to discuss a cease-fire, an
official from the group said.  The meeting, which includes representatives of Qaddafi and
the 22-member  Arab League , began at 11:30 a.m. local time in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, said the official, who declined to be
identified because he isn’t a spokesman.  African Union  Commission Chairman Jean Ping called for
direct talks between the two sides to stop the fighting and
agree on democratic changes, according to an e-mailed copy of
his opening address to the meeting.  Today’s talks will focus on how to end hostilities, provide
humanitarian assistance, create an “inclusive transition” and
reorganize Libya’s constitution and electoral system, according
to a separate e-mailed statement from the African Union.
Participants at the meeting will also hold consultations about
the impact of the Libyan unrest on neighboring nations, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
