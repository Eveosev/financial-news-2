The Philippine peso rose, headed
for a weekly gain, after the central bank raised  interest rates 
for the first time since 2008 and signaled further increases may
be needed to tame inflation. Five-year bonds advanced.  The currency climbed to a two-week high after U.S. data
showed a dip in jobless claims, bolstering confidence a recovery
will be sustained in the world’s biggest economy. Bangko Sentral
ng Pilipinas yesterday raised its benchmark overnight borrowing
rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent in what Governor Amando
Tetangco described as a “pre-emptive” action.  “The peso reacted positively to the rate increase,” said
Marcelo Ayes, a Manila-based senior vice president at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. “Overall, risk appetite has
improved.”  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 43.338 per dollar as of 10:15
a.m. in  Manila , according to prices from inter-dealer broker
Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency gained 0.9 percent this week
and touched 43.325 today, the strongest level since March 10.  The  Philippines ’ economic growth remains on target and a
quarter-point increase in interest rates was “just right,”
Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said in a Bloomberg Television
interview today. President  Benigno Aquino  aims to expand the
economy by as much as 8 percent annually.  The U.S. Labor Department data showed jobless claims
declined by 5,000 to 382,000 in the week ended March 19, in line
with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  Philippine five-year bonds gained, pushing their yield to
the lowest level in seven weeks. The rate on the 7 percent note
due January 2016 fell 8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage point,
to 5.75 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. It
dropped 15 basis points this week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
