Merck KGaA, sole producer of a
paint pigment for automakers such as  Ford Motor Co. (F) , cannot
operate its Japanese factory because it is too close to a
nuclear reactor crippled by the earthquake and tsunami.  Merck’s Onahama factory, which produces the metallic paint
pigment Xirallic, will take four to eight weeks to restart once
company engineers can gain access to the facility, Gangolf
Schrimpf, a company spokesman, said. Merck doesn’t know when it
can re-enter the plant, which at 28 miles (45 kilometers) from
the Fukujima-Daiichi nuclear reactor is inside the exclusion
zone, he said.  “It’s not our fault and we can’t get back in,” Schrimpf
said in an interview. “It’s bad for us and bad for our
customers. It’s sort of at a dead-end currently.”  Darmstadt, Germany-based Merck isn’t affiliated with Merck
& Co., the drugmaker based in  Whitehouse Station ,  New Jersey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
