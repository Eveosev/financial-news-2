Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  hired Ben Solomon
from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to run commercial-mortgage backed
securities trading as banks ramp up groups dedicated to real
estate debt.  Solomon, who traded derivatives tied to commercial real
estate loans at New York-based Goldman Sachs, will run secondary
commercial-mortgage backed bond trading at Deutsche Bank,
according to a person familiar with the move.  Renee Calabro , a
spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based lender, confirmed the hire.  Deutsche Bank is seeking to bulk up trading as Wall Street
firms have issued about $8 billion of commercial-mortgage backed
securities this year, compared with $11.5 billion in all of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank and
UBS AG sold $2.2 billion of the securities last month in the
largest offering since 2007 before the market seized up amid the
financial crisis.  “There’s a lot of movement” between banks following
payment of bonuses, said  Jeanne Branthover , a managing director
at Boyden Global Executive Search Ltd. in  New York . “Financial
services companies are hiring again. They are paying again. This
is the biggest war for talent we’ve ever seen.”  The market for newly issued commercial mortgage debt is
reviving after top-rated securities tied to real estate gained
6.6 percent in the past year, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data.  Solomon declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
