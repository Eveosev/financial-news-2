Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South
African bank controlled by Old Mutual Plc, raised 3.1 billion
rand ($451 million) through a sale of four bonds.  The lender issued 1.14 billion rand of five-year, fixed-
rate debt at 150 basis points above the benchmark 13.5 percent
government bond due September 2015, Bruce Stewart, head of
structured products and debt origination at Nedbank Capital,
said by phone from Johannesburg today. The government bond
traded at a yield of 7.76 percent at 3:30 p.m. in Johannesburg.
It also sold 450 million rand of three-year, fixed-rate debt at
128 basis points above government debt of the same maturity.  Nedbank plans to continue issuing senior debt in 2011,
Chief Executive Officer  Mike Brown  said on Feb. 28. The company,
which is rated BBB by  Fitch Ratings , its second-lowest of 10
investment grades, has 26.1 billion rand of outstanding debt
maturing in more than a year, according to its balance sheet for
the year through 2010.  “There is always ongoing growth and a need for liquidity
to fund that,” Stewart said. “We wanted to sell the debt post-
results and come with certainty to the market, and the pricing
has reflected that.”  Nedbank last month reported a 15 percent increase in profit
before one-time items, known as headline earnings, to 4.9
billion rand for the year through December as the lowest lending
rates in 30 years helped consumers repay debt.  Corporate Debt  South African companies have raised $4.63 billion of debt
in 59 issues this year, almost double the amount sold in the
same period a year earlier. Nedbank Capital has arranged eight
issues this year, and has 11 percent of market share by value of
contracts, making it the fourth-biggest underwriter, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the sale, Nedbank issued 677 million rand of five-year
floating-rate notes at 125 basis points above the three-month
Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate, which was at 5.575 percent
today. It also sold 838 million rand of three-year floating rate
securities at 105 basis points above Jibar.  Nedbank shares last traded unchanged at 137 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
