Milan prosecutor Eugenio Fusco is
probing movements of  Parmalat SpA (PLT)  stock amid a battle for
control that led to a 16 percent gain in the dairy company’s
market value this year, said two people familiar with the probe.  Parmalat Chief Executive Officer Enrico Bondi was
questioned as a witness by Fusco today, said two people, who
declined to be identified because the probe is ongoing. The
prosecutor has been reviewing share activity dating back to at
least February, one of the people said.  Groupe Lactalis on March 22 said it would buy the 15.3
percent stake held by a group of activist investors, boosting
its stake to 29 percent, becoming Collecchio, Italy-based
Parmalat’s biggest investor.  Lactalis bought the Parmalat shares from a group of foreign
investors that had been pressuring Bondi to use the company’s
1.44 billion euros ($2.04 billion) in net financial assets to
either make acquisitions or pay out bigger dividends. Bondi
accumulated the funds through lawsuits against the company’s
former banks and accountants, who he accused of helping sustain
the fraud that led to the company’s 2003 bankruptcy.  Spokespeople for Parmalat and Lactalis, who declined to be
identified in keeping with company policy, said they had no
comment today. A call to Fusco's office after hours wasn't
answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
