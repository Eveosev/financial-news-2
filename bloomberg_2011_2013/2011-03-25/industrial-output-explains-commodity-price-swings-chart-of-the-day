Swings in commodity prices “have
followed global economic activity” during the past few years,
according to Reuven Glick, an economist at the  Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco .  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how Glick drew that conclusion:
by comparing an index of worldwide industrial production with a
price gauge for commodities other than energy. These indicators
are compiled by the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy
Analysis and the Commodity Research Bureau, respectively.  “Commodity prices fell during the recent recession and
rose with the recovery,” primarily because of demand from
 developing countries , Glick wrote in a March 10 report.  Industrial output tumbled 12 percent for the 12 months
ended in March 2009, according to the Dutch bureau’s figures.
The U.S. and other countries were in the midst of recessions
during that time.  Since then, production has risen 19 percent. The index
reading for January, the most recent month available, was the
highest since the bureau’s data began in 1991.  Glick’s version of the chart, starting in 2000, appeared in
a posting yesterday on the Wall Street Examiner financial blog.
Lee Adler, the blog’s editor and publisher, wrote that money
printing by the  Federal Reserve  led to the shifts in both
industrial output and commodity prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
