MRS Logistica (MRSA3B)  SA, a Brazilian rail
operator, will invest 1.5 billion reais ($900 million) this year
to increase its transport capacity, Valor Economico  reported ,
citing company President Eduardo Parente.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company will spend more than 400
million reais to buy 90 locomotives as demand to transport  iron
ore  rises, the newspaper said. MRS transported 22.5 million
metric tons in the first two months of the year, a 9 percent
increase, Valor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
