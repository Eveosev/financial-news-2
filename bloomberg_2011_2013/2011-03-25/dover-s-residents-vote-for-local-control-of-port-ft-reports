The port of Dover, in southeast
 England , may be bought for 200 million pounds ($322 million) by
the local community, the Financial Times reported.  Ninety-eight percent of the town’s residents who voted in a
referendum supported a “People’s Port” plan led by Charles
Elphicke, the local Conservative member of parliament, to keep
the port under local control rather than allow it to fall into
private hands, the newspaper said.  The community bid, which has funding commitments, must be
approved by the government before it can proceed, the FT said.  The campaign began when Dover Harbour Board, a trust that
has operated the port since 1606, asked the government for
permission to sell its majority stake to a private investor to
finance construction of a new cross-Channel ferry terminal, the
newspaper said.  Adrian Bell, who heads debt advice and origination at
Evolution Securities Ltd. and is advising on Elphicke’s plan,
said “strong indications of support” have been received from
several banks, at least two of them “major U.K. banks,” the FT
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
