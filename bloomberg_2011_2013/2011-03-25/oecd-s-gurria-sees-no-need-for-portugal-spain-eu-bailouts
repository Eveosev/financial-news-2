Angel Gurria , the secretary-general
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
said Portugal and Spain should not need to seek assistance from
the European Union.  “The line should be drawn in the sand after Ireland and
Greece,” Gurria said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television’s “Last Word” today. “Portugal and Spain have done
what is necessary.”  Fitch Ratings  and Standard & Poor’s yesterday downgraded
Portugal’s sovereign-credit ratings after Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  offered to resign when lawmakers rejected his budget-
cutting plan.  “In the case of Portugal they’ve taken all the political
decisions and policy decisions that were necessary,” Gurria
said. Spain is “starting to differentiate the product very
successfully. They’re addressing their deficit, their pensions,
their labor market and they’re addressing their banking
system.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
