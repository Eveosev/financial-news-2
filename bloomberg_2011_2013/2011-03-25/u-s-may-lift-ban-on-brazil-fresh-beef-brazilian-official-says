The U.S. may lift a ban on fresh
beef imports from some Brazilian states this year, according to
a Brazilian official.  “There are well-founded reasons to believe that the
situation may be solved by the end of this year,” Emilio Garofalo, secretary of the government’s Foreign Trade Chamber,
said yesterday in a phone interview from Brasilia.  The U.S. may lift a ban on imports from 15 Brazilian
states, including  Sao Paulo , Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and
Goias states, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
