The pound approached the weakest
since November versus the euro as European leaders met in
Brussels and investors bet the  European Central Bank  will raise
interest rates before the Bank of England.  Britain’s currency slipped to the lowest in a week against
the dollar, dipping below $1.61. Data yesterday showed U.K.
retail sales fell more than economists estimated, stoking
concern about Britain’s recovery.  Sterling depreciated 0.1 percent to 88.01 pence per euro as
of 8:35 a.m. in London. It yesterday reached 88.09 pence, the
weakest since November 4. Against the  U.S. dollar , the pound
fell 0.2 percent to $1.6084.  U.K. government bonds were little changed, with the yield
on the benchmark 10-year gilt at 3.58 percent. The 3.75 percent
bond due September 2020 fell 0.16, or 1.6 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,640) face amount, to 101.2. The two-year yield was unchanged
at 1.26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
