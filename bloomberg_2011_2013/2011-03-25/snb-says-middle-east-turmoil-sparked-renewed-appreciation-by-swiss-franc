The Swiss central bank said Middle
East unrest sparked a renewed appreciation of the franc against
the euro and the dollar.  “The growing strength of the  Swiss franc  since November
has so far had only a moderate effect on the import price
index,” the Zurich-based central bank said in its  quarterly
report  on its website today. “The Swiss franc prices of some
import goods react with a time lag to movements in the exchange
rate, as they are adjusted by companies at only irregular
intervals.”   The  Swiss National Bank  also said that exports have lost
“considerable momentum” over the past year, given the
“continued strength” of the currency. The economy may expand
about 2 percent this year, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
