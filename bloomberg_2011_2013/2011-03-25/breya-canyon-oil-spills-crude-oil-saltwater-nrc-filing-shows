Breya Canyon Oil was yesterday
spilling crude mixed with seawater from a Los Angeles pipeline
at the rate of 200-300 gallons per minute, according to a  filing 
with the National Response Center.  The mixture was escaping into a storm drain that leads to
Machado Lake, according to the filing. The spill was possibly
the result of mechanical failure and the fire department is
attempting to secure the leak, it said.  U.S. refineries and producers must notify the response
center if they release hazardous substances in excess of
reportable quantities, according to the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly
known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldnâ€™t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
