Japanese investors bought more
foreign assets than they sold after the biggest earthquake on
record, evidence that the yen’s climb to a post World-War II
high after the March 11 disaster wasn’t driven by repatriation.  Purchases of foreign assets including bonds and notes
exceeded sales by 291 billion yen ($3.6 billion) during March
13-19, the  Finance Ministry  said in a report in  Tokyo  today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
