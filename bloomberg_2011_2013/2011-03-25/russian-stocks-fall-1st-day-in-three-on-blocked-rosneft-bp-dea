Russian stocks gained for the
seventh day in eight, led by OAO Rostelecom, after MSCI said
 Russia ’s dominant long-distance phone company may be included in
its Russia index.  The Micex Index rose 0.7 percent to 1,807.46 at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, extending the week’s gain to 3.44 percent,
the best weekly rise since Dec. 5. The dollar-denominated RTS
Index climbed 0.7 percent to 2,041.49.  Rostelecom advanced 6.4 percent to 172.06 rubles, the
biggest jump since Jan. 12, after MSCI said the company’s merger
with regional telecoms will boost the company’s market
capitalization by more than 50 percent, making the united
company eligible for inclusion in the “large cap” part of the
MSCI Global Standard Indexes.  “We assess the potential new flows into the stock at $400
million from MSCI index trackers and $1.2 billion from actively
managed funds,” VTB Capital wrote in a note today. “The move
will increase the weight of Russia in the emerging-markets
universe.”  OAO Sberbank climbed 0.4 percent to 105.50 rubles. Russia’s
biggest lender increased its stake in the Micex exchange to 10.2
percent from 7.3 percent, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
