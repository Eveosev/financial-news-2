The Portuguese government must
adhere to its budget deficit-reduction goals through 2013 no
matter who becomes prime minister, said Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers.  Juncker spoke to reporters in Brussels today after a
meeting of European Union leaders on the debt crisis.  “The next Portuguese prime minister must understand that
 Portugal  has a duty concerning the stability of its finances.”  “It’s too early to comment on Portugal. We must wait to
see what happens in the next few weeks.”  “I insisted in talks with the Portuguese opposition leader
that Portuguese policy must make clear that the goals the
country has set for itself -- to have a budget deficit of no
more than 4.6 percent in 2011, 3 percent in 2012 and 2 percent
in 2013 -- must be respected and adhered to by any  Portuguese
government .”  “There has been no request from the Portuguese authorities
for the support of the euro area, and as long as there’s no
specific Portuguese request, I’m not willing to answer this
question. Portugal won’t be left alone by the other Europeans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
