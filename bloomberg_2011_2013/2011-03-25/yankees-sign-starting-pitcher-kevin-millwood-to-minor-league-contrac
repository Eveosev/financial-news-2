The  New York Yankees  signed free
agent pitcher Kevin Millwood to a minor-league contract.  The 36-year-old right-hander will join the team when he
passes a mandatory physical, the team said in a press release.
Millwood has compiled a record of 159-137 during his 14-year
career with five teams.  The Yankees are returning three starting pitchers from last
season -- CC Sabathia, A.J. Burnett and Phil Hughes. Sergio Mitre, who made three starts for the team last season, was
traded today for Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Chris Dickerson.  Millwood joins Ivan Nova, Freddy Garcia and Bartolo Colon
as starting pitchers competing for a spot in the five-man
rotation. Millwood has made at least 30 starts in five of the
last six years and pitched at least 190 innings in eight
different seasons. He won more than 15 games four times in his
career, 1998, 1999 and 2002 with the  Atlanta Braves  and in 2006
with the  Texas Rangers .  Millwood was 4-16 with a 5.10 earned-run average in 31
starts with the  Baltimore Orioles  last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
