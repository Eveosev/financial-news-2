Spanish savings banks will only
seek 5.7 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in aid from the government
rescue fund,  El Economista  reported, without citing anyone.  The amount, which is far less than the Bank of  Spain â€™s
estimate of 14 billion euros, is subject to change as some
entities will complete mergers before a deadline to present
recapitalization plans expires, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
