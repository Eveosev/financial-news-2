Tanzania’s benchmark coffee grade
fell 5.2 percent at an auction yesterday on deteriorating bean
quality and increased supply, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The average price for the top arabica AA grade declined to
$310.76 a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $327.93 at the
previous sale, the board said in an e-mailed statement today.
Supplies more than doubled to 2,572 bags, it said. Prices of
other grades climbed as stocks declined and global prices
improved, the agency said.  “Overall average prices at Moshi exchange for mild arabica
were up by $10.14 per bag and robusta down by $11.74 per bag
compared to the last auction held on March 10,” the board said.  The bulk of the beans supplied were of inferior quality,
although some lots of good-quality grades were offered, William
Harris, managing director of Moshi-based Taylor Winch (Tanzania)
Ltd., said by phone today.  “The main problem was quality, because some of the beans
had been withdrawn during earlier auctions because of poor
quality,” he said. “The terminal market in  New York  was
significantly down from two weeks ago.”  Supplies at the 29th auction of the 2010-11 season fell 19
percent to 9,918 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags from 12,313 bags
at the previous sale, the agency said. The board prices its
beans in terms of 50-kilogram bags, while offers and sales are
in 60-kilogram bags.  Sales at the auction slid 24 percent to 7,623 bags from
10,038 bags on the prior occasion, the agency said.  Tanzania reaps its coffee crop from April through August.
The arabica variety accounts for 75 percent of production.  Following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
