Nigeria will spend about 912
billion naira ($5.9 billion) to buy 200 locomotives, Punch
 reported , without saying how it got the information.  Nigerian Railway Corp. has already taken delivery of 25
locomotives from Connecticut-based General Electric Co. at a
cost of 114 billion naira, the Lagos-based newspaper said.  About 60 percent of the trains will be dedicated to
passenger services in Lagos, Kano, Enugu and three other states,
while the remainder will be reserved for freight services, Punch
said, citing John Dottie, Lagos railway district manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
