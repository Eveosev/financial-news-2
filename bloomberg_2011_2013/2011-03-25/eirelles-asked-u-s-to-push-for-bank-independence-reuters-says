Former Brazilian central bank
President Henrique Meirelles asked U.S. diplomats to lobby his
government for greater bank independence, Reuters said, citing
U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.  Meirelles made the request in a 2006 meeting with U.S.
diplomats, Reuters said, citing a cable obtained by WikiLeaks,
which publishes secret government and corporate documents
online, and given to the  news agency  by a third party.  Meirelles told the diplomats that then-Treasury Secretary
 Henry Paulson  could be an effective advocate pushing Brazil’s
Congress and former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for
greater central bank autonomy, according to Reuters. Brazil’s
central bank is not formally independent like the U.S. Federal
Reserve, where board members are appointed to fixed terms.  Meirelles, who is currently heading the government’s drive
to prepare for the 2016  Summer Olympics , said in an e-mail to
Bloomberg that the comments allegedly attributed to him don’t
represent the content of any conversation he’s ever had with
U.S. authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
