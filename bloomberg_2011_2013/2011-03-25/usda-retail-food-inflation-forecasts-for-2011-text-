Following is the text detailing
forecasts for percentage changes in annual food prices,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture :  Food Price Outlook, 2011  In 2011, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all food is
projected to increase 3 to 4 percent. Food-at-home (grocery
store) prices are forecast to rise 3.5 to 4.5 percent, while
food-away-from-home (restaurant) prices are forecast to increase
3 to 4 percent. Although food price inflation was relatively
weak for most of 2009 and 2010, cost pressures on wholesale and
retail food prices due to higher energy and food commodity
prices, along with strengthening global food demand, have pushed
inflation projections for 2011 upward.  The all-food CPI increased 0.8 percent between 2009 and 2010,
the lowest food inflation rate since 1962. Food-at-home prices
increased by 0.3 percent--the lowest annual increase since 1967-
-with cereal and bakery prices declining 0.8 percent and
processed fruit and vegetable prices dropping 1.3 percent. Food-
away-from-home prices rose 1.3 percent in 2010, the lowest
annual increase for restaurant prices since 1955.  See ERS data on CPI for food and CPI forecasts February 2011
Prices (Not Seasonally Adjusted)  The CPI for all food increased 0.4 percent from January to
February 2011, increased 0.9 percent from December 2010 to
January 2011, and is now 2.3 percent above the February 2010
level. The food-at-home CPI increased 0.6 percent in February
2011 and is up 2.8 percent from last February, while the food-
away-from-home index was up 0.2 percent in February 2011 and is
1.6 percent above last February. Recent food commodity price
increases, along with grocery store price increases over the
past few months, have pushed ERS’s forecasts for food-at-home
inflation up to 3.5 to 4.5 percent for 2011. The all-items CPI
was up 0.5 percent in February and is 2.1 percent above the
February 2010 level.  Beef prices increased 1.9 percent in February and are 10.8
percent above last February, with steak prices up 11.2 percent
and ground beef prices up 9.9 percent. Pork prices increased 1
percent in February and are 8.9 percent above last February’s
level. Poultry prices increased 0.5 percent in February and are
2 percent above prices last year at this time, with chicken
prices up 1.3 percent and other poultry prices (including
turkey) up 5.1 percent. As commodity prices and input costs have
risen over the past 9 months, beef and pork prices are now
significantly higher than in 2010. Increased inflation for beef
and pork products is expected in the first half of 2011, as
reflected in ERS’s forecasts--beef prices are now projected to
increase 4.5 to 5.5 percent and pork prices 6 to 7 percent in
2011.  Egg prices decreased 1.9 percent in February 2011, following a
1-percent drop in January 2011. Due to two months of sharp
increases in November and December 2010, egg prices are now just
0.1 percent above the February 2010 level.  Dairy prices were up 0.6 percent in February and are 2.4 percent
above the February 2010 level. Within the dairy category, prices
changed as follows in February: milk prices were up 0.5 percent
and are 3 percent above last February’s prices; cheese prices
were down 0.2 percent but are 1.1 percent above last February’s
level; ice cream and related product prices were up 2.1 percent
and are 5.9 percent above last February’s level; and butter
prices increased 3.6 percent this month and are 23.3 percent
above last February. In 2010, dairy prices were up only 1.1
percent from 2009 (following a 6.4-percent decline from 2008 to
2009). However, higher projected prices for farm milk in 2011
will lead to increases of 4.5 to 5.5 percent for retail dairy
product prices in 2011 based on current ERS forecasts.  Fresh fruit prices decreased a mostly seasonal 3.7 percent in
February. The fresh fruit index is still up 2.4 percent overall
from last year at this time, with apple prices up 4.1 percent,
banana prices up 5.1 percent, citrus fruit prices up 11.2
percent, and other fresh fruit prices down 2 percent. Fresh
fruit prices fell in 6 of the past 13 months, leading to an
overall fresh fruit price decline of 0.6 percent in 2010.
However, current forecasts predict some price inflation for
fruit prices in 2011. The fresh vegetable index increased 4.7
percent in February. Since last year at this time, fresh
vegetable prices are up 8.9 percent, with potato prices up 7.5
percent, lettuce prices up 19 percent, tomato prices up 10.3
percent, and other fresh vegetable prices up 6.5 percent.
Processed fruit and vegetable prices increased 0.1 percent in
February (the sixth monthly increase in the past 13 months) but
are 0.1 percent below the February 2010 level.  Cereal and bakery product prices were up 0.4 percent from
January to February 2011 and are up 1.1 percent from last year
at this time, with bread prices up 3.2 percent and breakfast
cereal prices up 1.5 percent over the past year. Although cereal
and bakery product prices declined 0.8 percent overall in 2010,
higher wheat commodity costs should begin to affect cereal and
bakery product prices over the next few months, causing prices
to rise 3.5 to 4.5 percent overall in 2011. Sugar and sweets
prices were up 0.8 percent in February and are 1.1 percent above
last February. Within the nonalcoholic beverages category,
prices changed as follows in February: carbonated drink prices
were down 1 percent and are down 0.8 percent from February 2010;
coffee prices were down 0.2 percent but are up 5.2 percent from
last February; and nonfrozen noncarbonated juices and drinks
prices were up 0.1 percent in February and are 0.5 percent above
the February 2010 level.  Background on the CPI for Food  Although ERS analyzes changes in retail prices for individual
food items, sometimes it is useful to record and analyze a
measure of change for the overall level of food prices.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the most publicized and most
widely used measure of the general level of prices in the  U.S.
economy . The CPI is a composite measure of the level of average
prices paid by urban consumers for a defined market basket of
goods and services, including food.  The CPI for food at home is a component of the full CPI and is
the principal indicator of changes in retail food prices.
Policymakers, both public and private, closely follow the CPI
for food consumed at home and its changes, which measure price
inflation for food items. The CPI for food consumed at home also
affects policy evaluation because the effects of many current
and proposed policies are evaluated based on CPI measures. To
contribute to the analysis of government and commercial
decisionmakers, ERS estimates the future direction of changes in
the CPI for all food, food at home, and food away from home (see
data on the CPI for food forecasts).  The food price level can be influenced by changes in costs
incurred by food system firms. Changes in input costs can
translate directly into changes in the CPI or may have little or
no effect. Researchers at ERS not only produce forecasts of the
CPI but also analyze the impact of economic factors on changes
in the CPI, including changes in firms’ costs.  ERS regularly updates and provides food price forecasts for the
short-term period of 12 to 18 months. These forecasts are a
composite of formal model results and judgment. Monthly Bureau
of Labor Statistics’ indexes for all food, food away from home,
food at home, and 15 food at home categories are used in
conjunction with ERS analysis to adjust the current short-term
forecasts for each of the food categories. See ERS data on the
CPI for food and CPI forecasts.  ERS food price forecasts are developed through a three-step
process:  First, USDA develops its 10-year baseline projections. The
baseline provides long run projections for the agricultural
sector and covers agricultural commodities, agricultural trade,
and aggregate indicators of the sector, including farm income
and food prices. The baseline projections are a conditional
scenario with no shocks and are based on specific assumptions
regarding the macroeconomy, agricultural policy, the weather,
and international developments. In particular, the baseline
incorporates provisions of the Farm Security and Rural
Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Act) and assumes that current
farm legislation remains in effect through the projections
period. For the actual projections, see the USDA Agricultural
Baseline Projections Briefing Room.  In the second step, ERS analysts develop the short-term
forecasts that incorporate the most recent baseline assumptions
and current information on market conditions and expectations,
weather patterns, commodity prices and supplies, and expected
consumer demand for specific foods.  In the third step, these short-term forecasts are compared
with a computer-based Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model that determines whether the ERS short-term
forecast falls within an expected statistical range of a 95-
percent confidence interval.  Food price forecasts developed using this three-step process are
subject to revision if the conditions on which they are based
should change significantly. Projections could be affected by
changes, for example, in the feed grain crop outlook; in export
markets, especially for meat items; in nonfarm markets; or in
weather-related crop conditions in major fresh fruit and
vegetable growing areas.  Historical data indicate that fresh fruits and vegetables and
egg prices are the most volatile food prices that ERS tracks.
Grain price changes affect the price of meats, poultry, eggs,
and dairy products more than the prices of other food items and
to a lesser extent cereals and bakery products. Because these
items account for more than half of the at-home food dollar,
price changes for these categories can significantly affect the
 Consumer Price Index  (CPI) for food at home.  SOURCE:  U.S. Department of Agriculture  To contact the reporter on this story:
