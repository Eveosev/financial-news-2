A federal appeals court panel in
 San Francisco  refused a request by Jared Lee Loughner’s lawyers
to return him from Springfield, Missouri, where he was sent for
a mental competency evaluation.  In the same order today, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in San
Francisco temporarily blocked both prosecutors and Loughner’s
lawyers from access to video recordings of clinical interviews
with Loughner conducted by Bureau of Prisons staff.  “The video recording should proceed, but no copy of any
video recording should be provided to or made available to any
counsel, pending further order,” the appellate panel said in
the one-page order.  Loughner, 22, has pleaded not guilty to charges he killed
six people and wounded 13 at U.S. Representative  Gabrielle Giffords ’s Jan. 8 community meeting outside a supermarket in
Tucson, Arizona. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns has scheduled a
May 25 hearing to determine whether Loughner is competent to
stand trial.  Loughner’s lawyers filed an emergency appeal yesterday to
overturn Burns’s order sending their client to Missouri for a
competency exam and providing both prosecutors and his lawyers
with video recordings of the examination.  Judy Clarke , Loughner’s lead lawyer, didn’t immediately
return a call to her office today.  The case is U.S. v. Loughner, 11-00187, U.S. District Court,
District of Arizona (Tucson).  To contact the reporter on this story:
