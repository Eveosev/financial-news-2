Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  won a
court ruling that will let it challenge a patent owned by  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  for the Seasonique birth-control
tablet.  A judge erred last year in upholding Teva’s patent, which
expires in 2024, without holding a trial, the  U.S. Court of
Appeals  for the Federal Circuit said today. The Federal Circuit
sent the case back to the lower court for further action.  The appeals court  said  that Corona, California-based Watson
was likely to win the lower court case, yet the judge wasn’t
asked to resolve the question of the patent’s invalidity.  “We leave that determination to the district court on
remand,” Circuit Judge Alan Lourie wrote for the three-judge
panel in  Washington .  Teva acquired Seasonique, a newer version of the now-
generic Seasonale, in the  Petah Tikva , Israel-based company’s
2008 purchase of Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. The disputed patent
covers a way to combine contraceptives with as many as seven
days of low-dose estrogen to limit premenstrual symptoms. Other
birth-control pills use placebos for those days.  Watson conceded it infringed the patent, and the validity
issue was the only remaining question in the case.  The case is Duramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Watson
Laboratories Inc., 2010-1331, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower court case is Duramed
Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Watson Laboratories Inc., 08cv116, U.S.
District Court for the District of  Nevada  (Reno).  To contact the reporter on this story:
