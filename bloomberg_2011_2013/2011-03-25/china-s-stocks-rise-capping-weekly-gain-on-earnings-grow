China ’s stocks rose, capping a
weekly gain for the benchmark index, as signs of an expanding
economy bolstered optimism earnings will exceed analyst
estimates and a drop in  oil prices  eased inflation concerns.  A gauge of financial companies gained the most in six weeks
as Bank of China Ltd. rallied for a fifth day after the lender
reported record profit.  Gree Electric Appliances Inc. (000651)  surged to
an all-time high as Sinolink Securities Co. boosted its earnings
estimates after the maker of home air-conditioners recorded a
jump in annual net income. Hainan Airlines Co., the carrier
whose profit soared 800 percent in 2010, rose the most in two
months on plans for tax-free shopping in the island.  “Corporate earnings are good so far,” said Wu Kan, a  fund
manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million.
“We might have a rebound going forward, but the magnitude will
be mild as the issue of inflation hasn’t been tackled.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, gained 31.11 points, or 1.1 percent, to
2,977.81 at the 3 p.m. close, the highest since March 9. It has
added 2.4 percent this week, the first advance in three weeks.
The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  climbed 1.3 percent to 3,294.48 today.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
