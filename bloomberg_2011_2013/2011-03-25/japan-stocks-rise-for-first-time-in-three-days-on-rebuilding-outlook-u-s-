Japanese stocks rose, driving the
Topix index to its biggest weekly gain since July, on the
outlook for orders to rebuild following the country’s worst
earthquake, and after a U.S. report showed falling unemployment
claims.  IHI Corp., a maker of heavy machinery, climbed 6.6 percent,
the most in the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average. Comsys Holdings Corp.,
which designs and builds phone and power facilities, rose 6.3
percent and Komatsu Ltd., the world’s No. 2 manufacturer of
construction machinery, gained 4.7 percent. Sony Corp., an
electronics maker that gets 20 percent of its sales in the U.S.,
increased 3.3 percent. Tokyo Electric Power Co., which operates
a nuclear plant crippled after the quake, dropped 6.2 percent.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.1 percent to 9,536.13 at the 3 p.m.
market close in Tokyo. It fell 8 percent from March 11 to
yesterday, the biggest decline among indexes for the world’s
largest equity markets, after an earthquake and tsunami that day
killed more than 10,000 people, razed homes and factories and
crippled the Fukushima nuclear-power station northeast of  Tokyo .  “There’s uncertainty about how big an impact the
earthquake disaster will have on the macro economy and on how
companies will factor the impact into their earnings forecasts,
but we can expect a boost from demand for reconstruction,” Ikuo Mitsui, who helps manage $270 million at Vivace Capital
Management Co.  The broader Topix index gained 0.4 percent to 857.38, with
about three shares advancing for every two that declined. For
this holiday-shortened week, the Topix rose 3.3 percent, the
most since July, and the Nikkei 225 increased 3.6 percent.  Post-Quake Plunge  The Nikkei 225 plunged 10 percent last week on concern
damage from the quake would hurt the world’s third-largest
economy, and the yen gained to a post-World War II high against
the dollar. Japanese investors bought more foreign assets than
they sold last week, the  Finance Ministry  said today, evidence
that the yen’s climb wasn’t driven by repatriation.  Purchases of foreign assets, including bonds and notes,
exceeded sales by 291 billion yen ($3.6 billion) from March to
19, the Finance Ministry said. Foreign investors bought 891
billion yen in Japanese stocks in the week to March 18, the most
since comparable records began in 2005, the ministry also said.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.4
percent today. The index advanced 0.9 percent yesterday in  New
York  after corporate profits topped analysts’ estimates and
figures from the Labor Department showed jobless claims declined
by 5,000 to 382,000 in the week ended March 19, in line with the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  ‘Steadily Recovering’  “The  U.S. economy  is steadily recovering,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “Unless
there’s bad news related to nuclear issues, we can expect stocks
will be bought back.”  IHI surged 6.6 percent to 193 yen, the most in the Nikkei.
Komatsu leapt 4.7 percent to 2,795 yen, the highest close since
July 2008, and was the second-most-actively traded stock in
Japan. Ebara Corp., a pump maker, jumped 4.4 percent to 431 yen.
The industry group that includes IHI, Komatsu and other heavy-
machinery makers was the second-largest boost to the Topix.
Comsys Holdings rose 6.3 percent to 827 yen.  “There’s reconstruction demand in Japan,” Vivace Capital
Management’s Mitsui said. “People expect demand for
construction machinery to recover in  North America , and in
emerging nations, especially  China , they expect it will remain
strong.”  Reconstruction Demand  Deutsche Bank AG analyst Toshiharu Morota, who has
maintained his “buy” rating on Komatsu since October 2009,
increased his estimate of the company’s operating profit for
this year to 231 billion yen from 210 billion yen. The company’s
latest forecast is for 230 billion yen.  “Results in construction machinery markets in most regions
in January-February were ahead of guidance in terms of percent
growth,” Morota said in a report dated yesterday. “We believe
the earthquake will have little impact on the earnings for the
year ending March 2011, with strong results through mid-March
offsetting any adverse impact.”  Sony jumped 3.3 percent to 2,634 yen. Advantest Corp., the
world’s biggest maker of machines used to test memory chips,
gained 2.5 percent to 1,430 yen. Nissan Motor Co.,  Japan ’s
third-largest carmaker by sales, advanced 1.5 percent to 681
yen.  Sony also got a boost after Deutsche Bank increased its
rating on the company to “buy” from “hold,” citing an
improving profit outlook and valuations.  Among stocks that fell, Tokyo Electric Power declined for a
third day, losing 6.2 percent to 846 yen. The company had the
sharpest slide in the Nikkei 225, followed by NEC Corp. and was
the most actively traded stock in Japan. NEC, Japan’s biggest
maker of personal computers, slumped 5.5 percent to 171 yen,
after the company said it won’t pay a full-year dividend, citing
expected losses from the March 11 earthquake. NEC paid a
dividend of 4 yen per share a year earlier.  “If nuclear issues become more serious or there’s more bad
news, a correction mode may linger,” Vivace Capital
Management’s Mitsui said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
