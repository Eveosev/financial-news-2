Harmony Gold Mining Ltd.,  Africa ’s
third-biggest producer of the metal, dropped the most in five
months in Johannesburg trading after dismissing a suggestion it
could become a takeover target.  The shares fell 3.5 percent to 95 rand at the 5 p.m. close,
the largest one-day decline since Oct. 7. The stock yesterday
jumped the most in more than two years after  RBC Capital Markets 
said another mining company may bid for Harmony to strip out its
Papua New Guinea assets and re-list the rest separately.  Any move to separate Harmony’s assets would see its non-
South African operations “gobbled up” by “majors,” Chief
Executive Officer Graham Briggs said yesterday in an interview
with SAFM radio station after the market closed.  Harmony was reduced to “underweight” from “neutral”
today at HSBC Holdings Plc by analyst Sabrina Grandchamps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
