Petrol Group d.d., Slovenia’s
biggest energy company, said 2010 profit more than tripled after
a loss from its units wasn’t repeated. Shares surged.  Net income soared to 35.5 million euros ($50 million) from
10.4 million euros a year earlier, the Ljubljana-based company
said in a  statement  to the city stock exchange. Revenue rose 20
percent to 2.8 billion euros, the company said.  “Last year, sales of oil products have been very good and
we didn’t have to write down the value of our assets, especially
in  Istrabenz (ITBG) ,” Aleksander Salkic, Petrol’s spokesman said by
telephone today.  Petrol in 2007 bought a third of Istrabenz Group d.d., a
holding company with interests in food, energy and tourism that
was struggling with debt repayments.  The Slovenian company, which focuses on business in the
Balkans, may benefit from an accord with the  Russia ’s OAO
Gazprom Neft. The two companies signed an agreement to cooperate
in the supply and distribution of oil products in southeastern
 Europe  during a recent visit by Premier  Vladimir Putin  to
Slovenia.  “Results are slightly above our expectations,” Milan
Smiljanic, head of trading at Ljubljana-based brokerage
Perspektiva d.d. said in a telephone interview. The company owns
Petrol shares. “The deal with Gazprom Neft is also likely to
have a positive effect for Petrol.”  Petrol rose the most in almost two years in Ljubljana. The
stock advanced 25.05 euros, or 10.9 percent, to close at 259
euros at the Ljubljana stock exchange, the biggest gain since
June 2009. That gives Petrol a market value of 541.4 million
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
