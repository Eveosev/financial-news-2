Malaysia ’s ringgit completed its
best week this year and reached the strongest level in 13 years
on speculation borrowing costs will be raised to help cool
inflation.  The currency had its first weekly gain in three as
economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted consumer prices in
Southeast  Asia ’s third-largest economy rose 2.7 percent in
February from a year earlier, the most since April 2009. The
statistics department will release the data about 5 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur.  Government bonds  declined before a debt sale next
week.  “Inflation is rising across the region while economic
growth in Asia remains resilient,” said Sim Moh Siong, a
foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd.
“Therefore we can expect the tightening cycle in Malaysia to
continue.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.8 percent to 3.0255 per dollar
as of 4:12 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  from a week ago, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It gained 0.1 percent today and
touched 3.0210, the highest level since October 1997.  Bank Negara Malaysia  said on March 23 that economic growth
is likely to improve in the second half of the year and the
upside risks to inflation have become increasingly visible in
2011. It forecast prices to rise by 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent
this year versus 1.7 percent in 2010.  Policy makers have kept the overnight rate at 2.75 percent
since July, after raising it three times earlier in 2010. They
doubled the statutory reserve-requirement ratio to 2 percent,
effective from April 1, to absorb excess cash in the system. The
central bank’s next rate-setting meeting is on May 5.  Swaps, Bonds  Bank Negara  will raise the policy rate by 25 basis points,
or 0.25 percentage point, in May and lift it to 3.5 percent by
the end of the year, according to a research note from Standard
Chartered Plc today. This should support the ringgit as higher
 interest rates  drive capital inflows, it said.  The bank also recommended paying five-year interest-rate
swaps in Malaysia because the market doesn’t appear to be
aggressively pricing in higher borrowing costs. The rate may
climb to 4.5 percent from the current 4.05 percent, Standard
Chartered predicted without specifying the timeframe.  Benchmark 10-year bonds fell this week. The yield on the
4.16 percent note due July 2021 climbed five basis points to
4.06 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. It rose one basis
point from yesterday.  The treasury will sell 4 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion) of
debt maturing in September 2014 on March 30. The auction will
bring total bond-sale proceeds for this quarter to 24.5 billion
ringgit, 29 percent more than in the same period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
