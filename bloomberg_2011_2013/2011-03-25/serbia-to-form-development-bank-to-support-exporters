Serbia will establish the
 Development Bank  later this year to consolidate support and
services for its exporters as it seeks to narrow its trade
deficit, Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  said.  The bank will be set up as a non-profit government body and
won’t be subject to regulations that apply to commercial banks,
Cvetkovic said. It will be formed by October, helping Serbian
exports grow further after increasing 24 percent last year, the
premier said at a business forum in Belgrade today.  Serbia is consulting with German KfW on how to organize the
bank, which will provide comprehensive support to export-
oriented industries, consolidating and expanding the work done
so far by the country’s Export Credit and Insurance Agency and
Development Fund, Cvetkovic said.  Under a government-endorsed development plan,  Serbia ’s
output should double by 2020, on the back of exports rising 10
percent a year on average, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
