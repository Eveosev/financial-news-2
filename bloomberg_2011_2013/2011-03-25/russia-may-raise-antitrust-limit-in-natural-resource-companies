Russia  may raise the antitrust
limit on ownership in companies involved in extracting the
country’s natural resources.  Legislation has been prepared that will allow investors to
buy as much as 25 percent in a company involved in resource-
extraction without anti-trust approval or the permission of a
commission on foreign investment, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
told the Cabinet today. The current limit without prior approval
is 10 percent, he said.  Russia is the world’s largest producer of oil and natural
gas and the home to United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest
producer of aluminum, and OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s
largest nickel miner.  The proposal will be sent to lawmakers in Russia’s Duma for
approval in April, Igor Artemyev, head of Russia’s Federal Anti-
Monopoly Service, also said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
