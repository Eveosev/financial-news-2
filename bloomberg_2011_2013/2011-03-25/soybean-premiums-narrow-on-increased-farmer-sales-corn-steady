Cash premiums for soybeans shipped
this month to terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to
Chicago futures as farmers increased sales of last year’s
harvest after prices rose. Corn bids were unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month at  Gulf of Mexico  ports was 61 cents to 70 cents a bushel
above May futures, compared with 64 cents to 70 cents yesterday,
U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The corn basis was
unchanged at 50 cents to 53 cents a bushel. This week,  bids  for
the grain rose from 48 cents to 50 cents on March 18.  “Farmers increased sales this week ahead of increased
competition from supplies coming out of South America,” where
harvesting began late last month, said  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines , Iowa.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 3.75 cents, or 0.3
percent, to close at $13.5825 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade today. Corn futures for May delivery fell 13 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $6.895 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
