On Aug. 4, 1639, William Okeley
sailed from the Isle of Wight on the Mary, bound for  South
America . He was captured by pirates and taken to Algiers, where
he was paraded in front of the pasha, Yusuf II, before being
sold at the slave market.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Okeley had a lot to fear. Christians were sometimes
tortured to force a conversion to Islam, males could be raped,
and punishment was appalling. One slave had his arms and legs
broken with a sledgehammer, another was thrown from a high wall
onto a meat hook and left to die, while another was dragged
naked through the streets, his ankles tied to a horse’s tail.  In the 17th century, more than a million Europeans were
sold into slavery on the Barbary Coast. Okeley was one of the
very few who, after years in captivity, managed to escape and
make it back to  England .  I spoke with Adrian Tinniswood, author of “Pirates of
Barbary,” on the following topics:  1. Christians vs. Muslims  2. Capturing Slaves  3. State-Funded Crime  4. Pirate Terror  5. Paying Tribute  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the

Time” interview series for Bloomberg News.)  To contact the writer on the story:
