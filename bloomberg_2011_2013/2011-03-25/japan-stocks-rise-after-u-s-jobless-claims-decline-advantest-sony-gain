Japanese stocks rose for the first
time in three days on the outlook for orders to rebuild
following the country’s worst earthquake, and after a U.S.
report showed a decline in unemployment claims.  Comsys Holdings Corp., which designs and constructs phone
and power facilities, jumped 5.2 percent, the biggest gain in
the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average. Ebara Corp., a pump maker, climbed
4.9 percent and Komatsu Ltd., the world’s second-largest
manufacturer of construction machinery, advanced 4 percent. Sony
Corp., an electronics maker that gets 20 percent of its sales in
the U.S., increased 3.8 percent.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.9 percent to 9,521.70 as of 9:30 a.m.
in Tokyo. It fell 8 percent from March 11 to yesterday, the
biggest decline among indexes for the world’s largest equity
markets, after an earthquake and tsunami that day killed
thousands of people, razed homes and factories and crippled the
Fukushima nuclear-power station northeast of Tokyo.  “Unless there’s bad news related to nuclear issues, we can
expect stocks will be bought back,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, a
market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “The  U.S. economy  is
steadily recovering.”  The broader Topix index climbed 0.6 percent to 859.06, with
all but one of its 33 industry groups advancing. For this
holiday-shortened week, the Topix has risen 3.5 percent, on
course for its biggest weekly gain since July, and the Nikkei
225 has increased 3.4 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.2
percent today. The index advanced 0.9 percent yesterday in  New
York  after corporate profits topped analysts’ estimates and
figures from the Labor Department showed jobless claims declined
by 5,000 to 382,000 in the week ended March 19, in line with the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
