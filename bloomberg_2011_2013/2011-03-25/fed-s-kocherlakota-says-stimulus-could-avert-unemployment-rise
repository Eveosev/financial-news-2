President  Narayana Kocherlakota  said monetary policy stimulus,
when done on a sufficient scale, could stop a bursting asset
price bubble from causing an increase in unemployment.  “The bubble collapse has no impact on unemployment or
output, given sufficiently accommodative monetary policy,” the
bank president said, referring to an economic model in the text
prepared for a speech today in Marseille.  Kocherlakota, who votes on monetary policy this year,
qualified his remarks saying, “the paper should be viewed only
as an exploration of the properties of a new economic model and,
as such, containing no information about my own thinking about
current policy.”  The regional chief voted with the rest of the  Federal Open
Market Committee  last week to keep in place the Fed’s second
round of large-scale Treasury purchases to stimulate growth and
reduce unemployment. He said earlier this month that he sees no
reason to stop the Fed’s $600 billion program and that it’s too
soon for the central bank to begin withdrawing record stimulus.  “With insufficiently accommodative monetary policy --
generated perhaps by the zero lower bound on nominal  interest
rates  -- the bubble collapse can lead to increases in
unemployment,” Kocherlakota, 47, said at a conference on asset
prices, credit and macroeconomic policies.  Kocherlakota has led the  Minneapolis Fed  since October 2009
and is former chairman of the economics department at the
University of Minnesota. Kocherlakota earned his bachelor’s
degree in mathematics from  Princeton University  and his
doctorate from the University of Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
