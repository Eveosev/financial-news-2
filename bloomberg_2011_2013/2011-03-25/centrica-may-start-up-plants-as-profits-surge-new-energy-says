Centrica Plc (CNA)  is more likely to re-
open four out-of-service  power plants  by 2013 since profits for
generation using natural gas surged this week, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Winter 2013 clean-spark spreads, a measure of profitability
at gas-fed power plants for the six months from October 2013,
almost doubled, from about 2.60 pounds ($4.20) a megawatt-hour
to 5 pounds since March 22, Bloomberg data show. That’s the
highest in almost two months. The figure accounts for costs of
fuel and European Union emissions permits.  Centrica, Britain’s biggest energy supplier, said March 3
that its Barry, Kings Lynn, Peterborough and Brigg gas-fueled
power stations were in “preservation” mode, forecasting there
would be zero generation from the plants over the next year.  “There is a better chance now that the semi-mothballed gas
plants that Centrica has could come back online by 2013,” said
Matthew Cowie, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst in  London .  Bloomberg data is compiled using over-the-counter prices
from brokers including ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc. and Spectron
Group Ltd. Bloomberg’s sparks calculations assume an average
power station efficiency of 49 percent and 0.42 tons of carbon-
dioxide emissions per megawatt-hour of electricity produced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
