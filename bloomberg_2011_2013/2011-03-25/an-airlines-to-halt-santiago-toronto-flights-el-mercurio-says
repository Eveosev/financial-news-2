Lan Airlines SA (LAN) , Latin America’s
biggest air carrier by market value, will halt direct flights
between Santiago and Toronto because of increases in fuel
prices,  El Mercurio  reported.  The Santiago-Toronto flights will stop from April 3 while
the airline evaluates adjustments to long-haul flights to other
destinations, the Santiago-based newspaper reported, citing
company officials that it didn’t name.  Lan declined to comment, an official from the company’s
press department in Santiago said by telephone.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
