Orco Property Group (ORCO)  SA rose to its
highest in 1 1/2 years after the developer in central  Europe 
posted full-year profit for the first time since 2007.  Orco jumped as much as 13 percent to 252.1 koruna, its
highest intraday level since August 2009, and was trading up 7.4
percent at 240.5 koruna as of 11:43 a.m. in Prague, valuing the
company at 2.9 billion koruna ($167.5 million).  Net income  was 233.4 million euros ($330.7 million) last
year after a 2009 loss of 250.6 million, the Luxembourg-
registered company said late yesterday. Revenue rose 25 percent
to 315 million euros and net asset value rose to 28.6 euros per
share.  “Sales exceeded expectations thanks to higher revenue from
development,” Petr Bartek, an analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS,
the  Prague  unit of Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a report today.
“Rising net asset value reflects improving market conditions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
