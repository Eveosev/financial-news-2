Isovoltaic AG will start gauging
investor interest for its Vienna initial public offering today,
according to terms of the deal obtained by Bloomberg News.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  are joint global coordinators
and bookrunners in the sale.  Lebring, Austria-based Isovoltaic, which produces
backsheets for solar photovoltaic modules, is planning a share
sale that will end in the company having a so-called free float
of 45 percent, with only existing shares being sold, the company
said in a statement yesterday. The offer may raise as much as
300 million euros ($425 million), two people with knowledge of
the plans said in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
