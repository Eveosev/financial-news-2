What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation that
shipments to  China  will surge, said  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.
U.S. exporters sold 1.25 million metric tons to unknown buyers,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. Traders expect
the sales are to China, Shultz said.  -- Wheat futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as dry weather threatens crops in the U.S.
southern Great Plains and in China, and cold, wet conditions may
delay planting in Canada, Schultz said.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT on increased global demand for vegetable oils to
produce biofuel, Schultz said. Soybean-oil futures are expected
to open O.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal
futures may open up $1 lower to $1 higher for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
