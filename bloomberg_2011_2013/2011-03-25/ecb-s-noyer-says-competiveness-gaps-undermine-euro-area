Differences in competiveness among
member states undermine the stability of the euro area, and
penalties for countries that overspend should be automatic,
Eurepean Central Bank board member  Christian Noyer  said.  “I think that competiveness must be watched with precise
rules accompanied by sanctions,” Noyer, who is also governor of
the Bank of  France , said in a speech in the Breton town of
Vannes. “In particular, unit labor costs must absolutely be
compatible with the ECB’s inflation targets.”  Noyer said euro members have to ensure that governments
follow the limits on budget deficits set out in the Stability
and Growth Pact.  “On several occasions the ECB has expressed its conviction
that automatic sanctions for non-respect of the pact were an
essential condition for its future efficiency, but it is
obviously up to heads of government to decide,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
