U.S. stocks advanced, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest weekly rally since
February, after  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s profit forecast beat analyst
estimates and the rate of economic growth was revised higher.  Oracle, the world’s top supplier of  database software ,
climbed 1.6 percent. U.S. shares of  Accenture Plc (ACN) , the world’s
second-largest technology-consulting firm, rallied 4.5 percent
after its sales forecast beat analyst’s projections. Bristol-
Myers Squibb Co. advanced 3.3 percent after the pharmaceutical
company won U.S. approval a melanoma drug.  The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 1,313.80 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The gauge climbed 2.7 percent this week. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  advanced 50.03 points, or 0.4 percent, to
12,220.59 today. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index, which measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the  S&P 500 , fell 0.5 percent to 17.91,
extending its retreat since March 16 to 39 percent.  “Corporations are making money amid this pace of economic
growth,” said Kevin Caron, a market strategist in Florham Park,
 New Jersey , at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which has about $90
billion in client assets. “We saw a solid GDP number. The fact
that Oracle reported a decent forecast would be consistent with
that trend. As long as the data is supporting the recovery, the
S&P 500 can get to $100 a share of earnings over the next year
and a half. That means the index rising to 1,500.”  Recouping Losses  U.S. stocks rose yesterday, recouping losses that followed
 Japan ’s March 11 earthquake, as corporate profits beat estimates
and a government report showed a decline in jobless claims. The
S&P 500 has advanced 4.5 percent in 2011, extending last year’s
13 percent rally, amid government stimulus measures and an
eighth straight quarter of higher-than-estimated earnings.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter, led by a jump in  consumer spending  that will be
hard to match early in the year as energy prices surge. The
revised increase in gross domestic product compares with a 2.8
percent estimate issued last month, figures from the Commerce
Department showed today in  Washington .  Stocks rose even as the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan final index of consumer sentiment decreased to 67.5
from 77.5 in February. The preliminary estimate issued earlier
this month was 68.2. The median forecast of 67 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a reading of 68.  Emergency Aid  European Union leaders at a two-day meeting in Brussels
agreed to cut the startup capital for the future euro emergency
aid mechanism, while  Portugal  continued to rule out a rescue
after the parliament’s rejection of budget cuts led Prime
Minister  Jose Socrates  to offer to quit.  A bailout may total as much as 70 billion euros ($99
billion), two European officials with direct knowledge of the
matter said, as credit-rating cuts threatened to deepen
Portugal’s debt woes.  “The market has digested a lot of uncertainties in the
past couple of weeks, with the tragedy in Japan and the unrest
in  Libya ,” said Charles Stamey, who helps manage $42 billion at
Manning & Napier Advisors Inc. in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida . “I
certainly think the market is looking for some good news and
this is a bit of it,” he said of Oracle’s forecast.  Oracle climbed 1.6 percent to $32.64 after the company late
yesterday forecast profit excluding acquisition costs and some
other expenses of 69 cents to 73 cents this quarter, beating the
average analyst estimate of 66 cents. Earnings on that basis
were 54 cents a share in the period that ended Feb. 28, also
exceeding analysts’ projections.  Accenture Rallies  Accenture added 4.5 percent to $54.29. Third-quarter net
revenue, or sales before reimbursements, will grow to a range of
$6.3 billion to $6.5 billion, the Dublin-based company said. The
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey was $6.08
billion. The company also increased forecasts for full-year net
revenue growth to a range of 11 percent to 14 percent, from 8
percent to 11 percent, and for earnings per share to $3.22 to
$3.30, from $3.08 to $3.16.  “Very robust results from enterprise bellwethers Oracle
and Accenture will reassure people that the enterprise capex
cycle remains a powerful tailwind,” London-based analysts
Jonathan Tseng and Andrew Griffin at BofA Merrill Lynch Global
Research wrote in a report to clients.  Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 3.3 percent to $27.29. The
pharmaceutical company won U.S. approval for ipilimumab, the
first drug in a new family of medicines to treat advanced
melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer.  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  gained 2 percent to $24.44. The
world’s biggest pork processor said it sees no “backup” in
Japanese orders and that the nation is shifting to fresh pork,
according to a Barclays Plc presentation.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  slumped 11 percent to $56.89 after
the maker of the BlackBerry smartphone forecast first-quarter
revenue and profit that trailed estimates. Earnings will be
$1.47 to $1.55 a share as the company spends more on research
and steps up marketing for its PlayBook tablet and new
smartphones, RIM said late yesterday. Analysts had predicted
profit of $1.66 on average, excluding some costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
