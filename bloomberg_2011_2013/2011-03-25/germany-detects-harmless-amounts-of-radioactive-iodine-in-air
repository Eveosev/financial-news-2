Germany  detected minute amounts of
radioactive iodine in the atmosphere that are traceable to
 Japan ’s Fukushima reactors, the  Environment Ministry  said.  Traces of the radiated element were reported at three
measuring stations in Germany yesterday, the Berlin-based
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. The radiation
levels of the particles are “harmless” to health, it said.
