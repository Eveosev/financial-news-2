(Corrects Chuquicamata production in fifth paragraph of
story originally published March 25.)  Codelco, the world’s largest copper
producer, said annual production from its aging Chilean copper
mines fell for the fifth time in six years.  Codelco produced 1.769 million metric tons last year
compared with 1.782 million tons in 2009, the state-owned
company said in a  statement  on its website. Excluding its share
of the El Abra mine, owned by Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc., output slid to 1.689 million tons from 1.702 million tons.  Chief Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  is investing a
record $16.5 billion over five years to lift output at mines in
central and northern Chile, some of which are a century old.
Codelco’s profit rose to $1.88 billion in 2010 from $1.18
billion in 2009 as the metal’s price gained about 30 percent.  Codelco is “going to reach” its target of maintaining
output between 1.7 million and 1.8 million tons in 2011,
Hernandez told reporters in Santiago today. “We are facing
deficits in some areas and surpluses in others,” he said.  Codelco plans a $2.2 billion expansion at its largest mine,
Chuquicamata, where annual production rose to 528,000 tons from
511,000 tons, according to a statement posted on the website of
 Chile ’s securities regulator.  The outlook for Chuquicamata’s production is “complex” as
the company begins phasing out the current open pit to build a
new underground mine, Hernandez said.  Copper Market Outlook  Aging copper mines and geopolitical risk provide a
“challenging” environment for global mining companies, Codelco
said in the statement. Copper demand will be higher than
historic averages as emerging countries intensify their use of
the metal, the company said.  Copper rose in New York today, heading for a second
straight weekly gain, on signs the economic recovery is
accelerating in the U.S., the world’s second-largest copper
consumer. Futures for May delivery added 0.4 percent to $4.415 a
pound at 11:09 a.m.  New York  time.  “If we look at the issue of supply and demand, we think
effectively high prices should be maintained,” Hernandez said.
“But there always are surprises.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
