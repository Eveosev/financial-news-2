Taiwan ’s dollar gained the most in
more than three weeks after a U.S. government report showed a
decline in unemployment claims, boosting optimism the world’s
biggest economy is recovering.  The currency completed its first weekly gain in three and
the Taiex index of shares rallied as foreigners bought $409
million more local shares than they sold today, exchange data
show. The number of U.S. workers filing claims for jobless
benefits declined by 5,000 to 382,000 in the week ended March
19, Labor Department figures showed yesterday.  “We’ve seen foreigners buying Taiwan’s stocks again,
that’s the main reason for the currency’s appreciation,” said
Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader at the Union Bank
of Taiwan. “The economic data from the U.S. lifted sentiment in
 Asia  today.”  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.3 percent, the most since
March 3, to NT$29.488 against the greenback as of the 4 p.m.
local time close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
gained 0.4 percent for the week.  Government bonds  had the first weekly loss in three. The
yield on the 1.375 percent bond due March 2021, the most-traded
government debt, gained two basis points to 1.357 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate was little
changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
