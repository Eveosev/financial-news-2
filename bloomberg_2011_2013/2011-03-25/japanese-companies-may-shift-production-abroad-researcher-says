Some Japanese companies may shift
more production overseas because of electricity shortages after
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami shut nuclear power plants, a
researcher said.  “Companies currently face planned blackouts but they’ll
likely also be subjected to limits on total consumption,”
Shunsuke Furuya, a senior project manager at  Mitsubishi Research
Institute Inc. (3636) , said in an interview yesterday in Tokyo.
Restrictions on electricity usage may last several years to have
a “bottomless” impact on corporate earnings, he said, without
naming any companies.  Japan  is considering energy-saving measures that may need
to be implemented before an expected surge in electricity demand
in summer,  Kyodo News   reported  today. The 9-magnitude earthquake
and tsunami shut about 11 percent of the nation’s generating
capacity, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “It will be difficult to restart nuclear plants or to get
an approval to build one,” Furuya said. Some companies have
started considering shifting some of their production outside
Japan, while others have begun purchasing power-generating
facilities such as gas turbines, he said.  The death toll from the quake and tsunami climbed to 10,035
as of 11 a.m. local time, with 17,443 people missing, according
to the  National Police Agency  in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
