Videocon Industries Ltd. (VCLF) ,  India ’s
biggest consumer-electronics maker, picked  Standard Chartered
Plc (STAN)  to advise it on plans to combine the company’s energy assets
and sell a stake in its oil and gas business, said a person with
knowledge of the matter.  The company, led by billionaire Venugopal Dhoot, is seeking
to take advantage of crude’s 31 percent gain in the past year,
which makes oil and natural gas reserves more valuable. Videocon
may use the funds to invest in developing its assets in Asia,
 Africa  and Latin America.  Arijit De, a Standard Chartered spokesman in Mumbai,
declined to comment.  Videocon fell 1.4 percent to 189 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai after climbing as much as 1.7 percent. The
stock has declined 16 percent in the past year compared with an
8 percent increase in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  Videocon, based in Aurangabad, India, and partners  Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and Bharat Petroleum Corp. made three gas
discoveries off the coast of Mozambique, according to a Nov. 29
statement. The company and its partners also found hydrocarbons
in Brazil and Indonesia.  The company has $2.5 billion of debt, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Dhoot, with $2.67 billion in assets, is
ranked India’s 25th richest man, according to Forbes magazine.  India’s energy use may more than double by 2030 to the
equivalent of 833 million metric tons of oil from 2007,
according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
