Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day against the dollar as the central bank sold
securities in a bid to withdraw liquidity from the system, a
transaction known as a repurchase agreement.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
as much as 0.7 percent to 84.33 per dollar and traded 0.6
percent stronger at 84.40 by 5:03 p.m. in Nairobi from a close
of 84.89 yesterday, bringing its gain this week to 0.1 percent.  “The shilling has strengthened following the central
bank’s repo action where it has tightened liquidity by mopping
up excess cash in the market,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at
Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Kenya sold 2.85 billion shillings ($34 million) in
 repurchase agreements  after offering 10 billion of the
securities, the central bank said. The rate on the seven-day
agreements was 1.663 percent, according to the central bank’s
page on Bloomberg.  The central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 6 percent on March 22
after the shilling fell to a 17-year low and inflation
accelerated for a fourth consecutive month. All four economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast the rate would remain
unchanged.  The demand lagged supply at the repo sale as “market
players are cautious due to the unexpected rise in  interest
rates ,” Eric Musau, an analyst at Nairobi-based African
Alliance, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
