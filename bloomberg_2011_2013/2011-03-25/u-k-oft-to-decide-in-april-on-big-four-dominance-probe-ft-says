The U.K.  Office of Fair Trading 
will determine whether to carry out a probe of the audit market
on concerns about the dominance of the four biggest players,
Deloitte LLP, Ernst & Young LLP, KPMG LLP and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP next month, the Financial Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The “targeted market study” would examine whether “Big
Four-only” loan clauses, in which banks oblige borrowers to
engage one of the four biggest accounting firms to audit their
books, the FT said. All but one FTSE 100 company are audited by
one of the four, the newspaper said.  British Bankers’ Association Chief Executive Officer  Angela
Knight  said she was not aware of this “being a prevalent market
practice,” the FT said. “There is however a natural
gravitation from major companies to use one of the major
accountancy firms,” she said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
