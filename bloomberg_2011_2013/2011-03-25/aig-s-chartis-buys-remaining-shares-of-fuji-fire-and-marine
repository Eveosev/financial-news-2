American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out insurer, said its property-casualty unit
completed a tender offer for shares of Fuji Fire & Marine
Insurance Co. that it didn’t already own.  Chartis  Japan  Capital Co. purchased 305.3 million shares,
or 43.6 percent of the outstanding stock, of Fuji Fire and
Marine for 146 yen each, the New York-based insurer said in a
statement released by Business Wire today.  When the offer settles on March 30, the insurer will own
98.3 percent of Fuji Fire & Marine. Chartis Japan will acquire
the remaining shares and Fuji Fire and Marine will become a
wholly owned subsidiary, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
