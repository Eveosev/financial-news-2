Natural gas for next-day delivery
in the U.S. West slipped for the first day in eight on forecasts
of warmer weather that may reduce demand for the heating fuel.  Wholesale gas delivered at the Kingsgate BC hub, where gas
is transported from British Columbia to  Washington , fell 8.92
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $4.0691 per million British thermal
units on the Intercontinental Exchange.  The low temperature in Seattle, Washington, early today was
39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 Celsius), which is the average,
according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. The
overnight low may be 40 degrees, 1 degree above normal.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
fell 13.91 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $4.1317 per million Btu.
The decline was the first in six days.  A sample of scheduled gas deliveries to homes in the U.S.
and Canada shows shipments fell 2.4 percent to 35.1 million
dekatherms (34.2 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Residences in the western U.S. were to receive 3.5 million
dekatherms of gas, down 13 percent from yesterday, Bloomberg
data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants dropped 7.9
percent to 11.8 million dekatherms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
