United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
the world’s largest airline, said it hedged 44 percent of its
expected jet fuel needs for this year.  “Right now we’re a little less than 50 percent hedged for
2011, I think 44 percent is the number,” John Rainey, senior
vice president financial planning and analysis, said yesterday,
according to the transcript of a conference call on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
