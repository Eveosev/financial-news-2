The United Nations Human Rights
Council will send a commission of inquiry to  Ivory Coast  to
investigate allegations of abuses in the West African nation
mired in a violent post-election stalemate.  The probe will look into “allegations of serious abuses
and violations of human rights” following the country’s
disputed Nov. 28 presidential vote, according to an e-mailed
copy of the resolution made by the Geneva-based council, which
was backed by  Nigeria .  While the international community recognizes  Alassane Ouattara  as the winner of the election, the incumbent  Laurent Gbagbo , refuses to concede defeat, amid allegations of voter
fraud.  The resolution called on state-owned  Radio Television
Ivoirienne , which supports Gbagbo, and other media outlets
controlled by his supporters to “refrain from inciting
violence, hostility and the propaganda of hate speech.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
