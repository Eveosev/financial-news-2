Spot gasoline in New York Harbor
strengthened after a government report showed inventories of the
fuel in the region slipped and as imports held at their lowest
seasonal level in at least six years.  Gasoline inventories on the East Coast dropped 2.04 million
barrels to 60.4 million barrels last week, according to the
Energy Department. Imports were unchanged at 484,000 barrels a
day last week, the lowest level for a week in March since the
department began keeping records in May 2004.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 2.5 cents to 16 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:42 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery of the
fuel gained 1.8 cents to $2.8838 a gallon.  “We have seen that imports have been declining over the
last couple of weeks and we finally did see a significant draw
in New York Harbor gasoline inventories,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or carbob, in
 Los Angeles , widened 0.75 cent to 20.75 cents a gallon. The same
fuel in  San Francisco  gained 1 cent to 17.5 cents a gallon.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
 Gulf Coast  was unchanged, while prompt delivery of the grade
fell 0.3 cent to $2.921 a gallon.  “As people look out forward to what they hear on ship
fixtures, they see that the lower rate of imports is going to
continue over the next couple of weeks,” Lipow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
