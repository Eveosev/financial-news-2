The trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff’s firm said a lawyer’s attempt to remove him from his job
was a “baseless, fallacious and unprofessional attack” that
should be “summarily rejected” by the bankruptcy judge.  Helen Chaitman, a lawyer for Madoff investors, has been
seeking to overturn trustee  Irving Picard ’s $220 million
settlement with heirs of Norman Levy, saying Picard concealed
the scale of Levy’s business with the jailed conman. Earlier
this week in a court filing, she asked a judge to remove Picard
from his post.  Chaitman didn’t “set forth” any basis for the trustee’s
removal, a lawyer for Picard said in a letter to U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge  Burton Lifland  in Manhattan today.  “The attempt to remove the trustee and counsel in a reply
brief is procedurally flawed and lacks any foundational
support,” wrote  David Sheehan  of Picard’s law firm, Baker &
Hostetler LLP. “Moreover, it is a baseless, fallacious and
unprofessional attack upon the integrity of the trustee and his
counsel.”  The effort to undo the settlement should be denied, he
said.  Chaitman said Sheehan’s letter hadn’t challenged her claim
that Picard withheld “material” information.  “We will be seeking the appropriate relief,” she said in
a voice mail message.  The case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. Bernard
L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-01789,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
