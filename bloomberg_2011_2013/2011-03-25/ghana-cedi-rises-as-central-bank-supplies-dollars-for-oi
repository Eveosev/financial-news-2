Ghana ’s currency, the cedi,
appreciated against the dollar as the  Bank of Ghana  supplied
commercial lenders with foreign exchange to finance oil imports.  The cedi strengthened 0.1 percent to 1.5330 per dollar at
1:15 p.m. from a close yesterday of 1.5340, according to data
Standard Chartered Plc’s local unit.  “Most of the oil bills are funded by the central bank,”
said Kevin Adarkwa, a currency trader with the Accra office of
the lender. “Some flows have come in. I saw a bit yesterday and
a bit today.”  No one was available to comment at the Bank of Ghana’s
treasury department, said a woman who answered the phone and did
not identify herself.  To contact the reporter on this story:
