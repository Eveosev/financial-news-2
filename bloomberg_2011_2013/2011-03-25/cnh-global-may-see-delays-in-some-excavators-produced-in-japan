CNH Global NV (CNH) , an agricultural
equipment maker, may see supply disruptions in excavators made
in Japan in the second quarter, said James McCullough, chief
executive officer of the company’s construction equipment unit.  Excavators sold by CNH under the Case brand and the largest
of the excavators made by Kobelco Construction Machinery America
could be affected by damage from the earthquake and tsunami that
hit Japan on March 11, McCullough said. Under a joint venture,
Amsterdam-based CNH manages Kobelco brand excavators in  North
America , Latin America and Europe.  While the exact impact is unclear at this time, delays in
April or May could come from some employees’ inability to work
and lack of utilities, he said.  “It may be difficult to maintain production rates,”
McCullough said today in an interview at the CONEXPO-CON/AGG
construction industry conference in  Las Vegas . He said he
doesn’t expect disruptions to other components or products.  CNH is a unit of Fiat Industrial SpA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
