South Korea  plans to send back 27
North Korean citizens, whose boat drifted into its waters last
month, on March 27, South Koreaâ€™s Red Cross said in an e-mailed
statement today.  An initial plan to return the North Koreans on March 17 was
delayed due to bad weather and problems with the boat, according
to the statement.  North Korea  on March 15 agreed to let the 27 people return
after earlier refusing to take any back because four of the 31
from the boat sought to defect to South Korea, according to the
Unification Ministry in Seoul.  Separately, the South Korea found nine people, who appeared
to be North Korean defectors, in a vessel in its western waters
yesterday, coast guard spokesman Kim Yong Jin said by telephone.
Associated Press today reported six of the people are seeking
asylum in South Korea while three Chinese nationals would be
subject to deportation.  Telephone calls to coast guard seeking comment on the
report went unanswered today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
