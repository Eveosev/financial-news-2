Singapore  extended a ban on some
foods imported from  Japan  after finding radioactive contaminants
in vegetables that were as much as three times higher than
prescribed limits.  Imported rape seed plant was found to have 311 becquerel
per kilogram of iodine-131, exceeding the 100 Bq/kg standard set
by the United Nations  Food and Agriculture Organization ,
Singapore’s Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority said in a  statement 
on its website yesterday. Higher-than-acceptable levels were
also found in Japanese mustard and perilla leaf, the AVA said,
adding the food doesn’t pose a health threat.  The findings prompted the regulator to suspend imports of
fruit and vegetables from Chiba and Ehime prefectures, it said,
a day after it banned imports from four other prefectures near
the stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  “The short-term consumption of food at these detected
levels of radioactive contamination does not pose a health
hazard,” the AVA said. “An adult would need to consume 3.5
kilograms (7.7 pounds) of these vegetables to receive a similar
level of  radiation exposure  from one X-ray.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
