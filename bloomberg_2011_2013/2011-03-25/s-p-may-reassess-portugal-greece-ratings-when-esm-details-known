Standard & Poor’s  may “reassess”
the sovereign debt ratings of Greece and  Portugal  when full
details of the planned European Stability Mechanism emerge, said
 Moritz Kraemer , managing director of European sovereign ratings
at the company.  If S&P’s concerns are confirmed, “we would reassess the
ratings specifically of Greece and Portugal which we think are
the most likely potential customers of the ESM,” Kraemer said
in an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television’s
“Inside Track” in  New York  today.  As speculation mounted that Portugal will be the next
victim of Europe’s debt crisis, leaders bowed to German
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s call to pare the fund’s paid-in
capital as of 2013 to 16 billion euros ($23 billion), less than
the 40 billion euros foreseen in a March 21 accord.  Kraemer signaled he’s less concerned about  Spain  needing a
bailout any time soon.  “What we have seen in the last few weeks is that there is
more differentiation in the market place,” he said. “A few
months ago we would have talked about Spain in this context but
the market seems to have taken the view that Spain is in a
different category and not immediately threatened by the same
challenges as Portugal.”  “That’s our view as well and that’s the why the rating for
Spain remains significantly higher,” Kraemer said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
