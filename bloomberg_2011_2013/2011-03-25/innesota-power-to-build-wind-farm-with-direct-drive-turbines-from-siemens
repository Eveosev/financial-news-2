Minnesota Power , a division of
 Allete Inc. (ALE) , will build a 105-megawatt wind farm using direct
drive turbines from Siemens AG.  The $157 million Bison 2 wind project in central North
Dakota will use 35, 3-megawatt turbines made by Siemens,
 Minnesota  Power said in a statement. Financial terms of the
contract werenâ€™t disclosed.  Siemens expects to deliver the first turbines in August
2012, and the wind farm may go into commercial service by the
end of 2012, the Erlangen, Germany-based company said.  Minnesota Power, of Duluth, Minnesota, is already using
direct drive turbines from Siemens at its Bison 1 project near
Center, North Dakota. The manufacturer says the technology uses
fewer parts than conventional, geared turbines, which makes them
easier to maintain and increases output.  The utility submitted this week plans for the Bison 2
project to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for
approval, and expects to file a site permit application with the
 North Dakota  Public Service Commission in April, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
