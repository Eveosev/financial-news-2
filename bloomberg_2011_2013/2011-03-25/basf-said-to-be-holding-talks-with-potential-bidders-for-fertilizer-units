BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest
chemical company, is in talks with potential buyers of its
fertilizer units and hired Morgan Stanley to handle the sale,
two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The assets include a nitrogen site in Antwerp, Belgium, and
a share of a venture in France. Companies that already have
fertilizer operations have expressed interest in the units, said
the people, who declined to be identified because the process is
private.  The German company, based in Ludwigshafen, said earlier
this month that it would seek to sell the businesses, which
generate about 500 million euros ($707 million) in combined
sales.  BASF spokeswoman Jennifer Moore-Braun declined to comment
on the planned sale. A  Morgan Stanley (MS)  spokesman in  London 
declined to comment.  Yara International ASA (YAR) , the world’s largest publicly traded
nitrogen-fertilizer maker, may be interested in the operations
at the right price, spokesman Asle Skredderberget said March 10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
