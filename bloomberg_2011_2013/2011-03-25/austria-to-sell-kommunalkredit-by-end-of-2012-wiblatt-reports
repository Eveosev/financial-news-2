The European Union has told Austria
that it must sell Kommunalkredit Austria AG by the end of 2012,
Wirtschaftsblatt newspaper reported, without saying where it got
the information.     Should Austria fail to find a buyer by then, the Europea
Commission would appoint a trustee, who would sell the bank,
which was nationalized in 2008, within a year, the Vienna-based
paper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
