(Corrects name of dam to Lower Monumental in the second
and third paragraphs. The story was originally published March
24.)  Shipping on the Columbia-Snake
River System, a major gateway to the  Pacific Ocean  for U.S.
wheat and barley exports, will reopen on March 26 after a three-
month shutdown, the  Army Corps  of Engineers said.  Barge traffic has been “effectively” halted since Dec. 10
as eight dams along a 465-mile (748 kilometer) stretch of the
river system underwent repairs and maintenance, said Scott
Clemans, a spokesman for the Army Corps in  Portland ,  Oregon .
Work is finishing up today on two dams, The Dalles and
Bonneville, and the Lower Monumental dam will reopen March 26,
clearing the final obstruction on the waterway, he said.  The river system’s reopening, originally scheduled for
March 18, was delayed in part because of winds and heavy rain
near Lower Monumental and problems during the installation of
gates at The Dalles, Clemans said.  “For these projects, doing gate replacements, we’re
talking about tremendously large pieces of equipment that are
120 feet tall, 100 feet wide and weighing up to 2 million pounds
in some cases, and yet they have to be aligned within
millimeters,” Clemans said. “It’s a very complex and demanding
task.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
