Gold fluctuated after rising to a
record yesterday as turmoil in  Libya  and Japan spurred demand
for the metal as an investment haven. Silver headed for the
longest rally in more than three months.  Concern that Portugal may need a bailout also helped gold
reach an all-time high of $1,448.60 an ounce. The coalition
against Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi is taking aim at his armored
units, military facilities and supply lines after crippling his
air force. Japan’s nuclear regulator said one reactor core at
the damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant may be cracked and leaking
radiation.  “Gold is still in a  bull market , but it needs a fresh
catalyst,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC
in Chicago. “Gold has priced in the situation in  Europe , the
Middle East and Japan, and there isn’t an impetus to go higher
yet.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $1.80 to $1,436.70 at
10:39 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Before today, the metal
climbed 32 percent in the past 12 months.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 13.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $37.51 an ounce. The price was up for the sixth
straight session, the longest rally since early December. The
metal has more than doubled in the past 12 months.  Yesterday, sliver reached $38.18, the highest since
February 1980. In that year, the metal reached a record of
$50.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
