The U.K. government may raise its
 carbon tax  to ensure a premium over European Union emissions
permits that will give revenue, according to  Citigroup Inc. (C)   “It is clear that the setting of each year’s tax rate is
subject to ministerial discretion,” analysts including Meg Brown in London said in an e-mailed report yesterday. “So the
government does have the option to set it at a premium to the EU
carbon price regardless of where that price is. Without a
premium there is no  tax revenue  for the government.”  Chancellor  George Osborne  fixed March 23 the carbon tax at
4.94 pounds ($7.94) a metric ton in 2013. That’s based on a 16
pound floor, using 2009 prices, which rises to 30 pounds by
2020. The Treasury will publish details of the tax next week in
its response to a carbon price support  consultation  that ran in
the two months through Feb. 17.  European Union permits for December 2013 pared this month’s
gains, falling 2.3 percent to 18.43 euros ($26.10) a metric ton
yesterday on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
