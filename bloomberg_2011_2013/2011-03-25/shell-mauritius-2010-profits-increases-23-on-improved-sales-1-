Shell Mauritius Ltd. (SHELL)  said full-year
profit climbed 23 percent as business at its marine and retail
units increased.  Net income for the 12 months to Dec. 31 rose to 324.9
million rupees ($11.4 million) from 264.3 million rupees a year
earlier, it said in a  statement  on the Port Louis-based Stock
Exchange of Mauritius’s website today. Revenue advanced 12
percent to 9.45 billion rupees.  “Good growth in retail and marine has enabled the company
to improve its operating profit by 30 percent to 372 million
rupees,” it said.  The company declared a final dividend of 6.10 rupees for
its financial year 2010.  Vitol Group, in partnership with Helios Investment
Partners, agreed to buy the majority of Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s
shareholding in most of their downstream businesses in  Africa 
for about $1 billion, Vitol said on Feb. 19.  “The divestment includes the potential sale of the 75
percent of the share capital of Shell Mauritius held by Shell
Overseas Holdings Ltd.,” the company said today, without
