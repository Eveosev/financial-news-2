Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL) , a
Turkish gold miner, said owners including  Koza Anadolu Metal
Madencilik Isletmeleri AS (KOZAA)  sold $211.8 million worth of its
shares via  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   The sale of 16.8 million of its shares at 19.5 liras each
was aimed at increasing Koza Altin’s free float, with Koza Ipek
group companies still controlling 70 percent of the company,
Koza Altin said in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange 
today. Buyers weren’t identified.  The shareholders, which also include Koza Ipek Holding AS,
ATP Insaat & Ticaret AS, and Ipek Matbaacilik Sanayi & Ticaret
AS, raised 328.2 million liras ($211.8 million) from the share
sale, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the sole book-runner for the
placement, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Koza Altin fell 1.45 liras, or 6.7 percent, to 20.30 liras
at 4:52 p.m. in Istanbul, heading for the biggest drop since
June 2010. Koza Anadolu dropped 4 kurus, or 0.8 percent, to 4.79
liras. Ipek Matbaacilik advanced 5 kurus, or 1.4 percent, to
3.63 liras.  The Ipek family, which owns the companies, has agreed to
not sell more shares for 90 days, Goldman said.  Editor: Mark Bentley  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
