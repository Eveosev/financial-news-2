The European Union may allow
further duty-free imports of sugar in summer, when stockpiles
are usually low, as supplies in the bloc remain tight, broker C.
Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd. said.  Rising prices in the international market and a lower
European reference price have eroded EU sugar inventories,
Czarnikow said in a report today. Raw sugar climbed to a 30-year
high in New York trading last month. The EU’s reference price is
the basis for negotiations with importers.  The EU’s sugar-management committee this month backed plans
to import 300,000 metric tons of raw or refined sugar at zero
duty. The measure will apply from April 1 to Sept. 30, the
European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said March 10.
Changes to the bloc’s sugar industry introduced by the
commission in 2003 set limits for EU production.  “With national production quotas consequently finalized at
13.3 million tons of sugar, consumption in the EU of between 16
and 16.5 million tons per annum left the European market
structurally short of around 3 million tons of sugar a year,”
Czarnikow said.  The EU had aimed to fill the gap by importing from nations
including countries in  Africa  and the Caribbean and Pacific
regions.  “Although the EU reforms have produced a number of
efficiencies in beet sugar production, the market deficit has
not been met by imports as expected and the EU balance sheet is
fragile as a result,” Czarnikow analyst Peter de Klerk said in
a statement. “EU prices therefore will need to be competitive
to attract imports.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
