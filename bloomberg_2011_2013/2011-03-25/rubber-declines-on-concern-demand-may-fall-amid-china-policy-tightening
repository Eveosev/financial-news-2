Rubber in  Tokyo  declined, paring a
weekly gain, on concern demand from China, the biggest consumer,
may stall as the government continues to tighten monetary policy
to rein in inflation.  The August-delivery contract on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange fell as much as 3.9 percent to 419.2 yen a kilo ($5,175
a metric ton) and traded at 429 yen by 12:55 p.m. local time.
Futures have gained 5 percent this week, rallying to 446.9 yen
on March 23, more than 33 percent higher than a four-month low
reached this month, after  Thailand ,  Indonesia  and Malaysia, the
three biggest producers, agreed in principle to delay exports if
prices tumbled.  “The rally might fizzle out if the biggest buyer  China 
doesn’t step up to the plate and start buying in big volume,”
Forest Hu, manager at the rubber department of PKU Founder
Commodities Group Co., said by phone from Shanghai today. “From
here we can see that China’s tightening looks set to continue so
demand might be crimped.”  The central bank has raised  interest rates  three times
since October to cool inflation that reached 4.9 percent in
February, exceeding the government’s 4 percent annual target. It
has boosted banks’ reserve requirements nine times since the
start of 2010, including an increase of half a percentage point
from today.  China’s consumer prices may rise about 5 percent in March
from a year earlier, the China Securities Journal reported
today, citing a report by the pricing department of the National
Development and Reform Commission. Prices in the first quarter
may have gained about 4.9 percent, the report said.  China Supply  September-delivery natural rubber in  Shanghai  dropped 0.9
percent to trade at 35,560 yuan ($5,422) a ton at the 11:30 a.m.
local time break, paring declines of as much as 1.7 percent.  China’s Hainan province, the country’s biggest producer,
will start tapping rubber trees in late March, Zhang Bei,
analyst at Nanhua Futures Co., said yesterday. “So domestic
supply will be on the rise as those Hainan produce is coming on
stream,” Zhang said.  Rubber in Tokyo on March 15 fell to 335 yen, the lowest
level since Nov. 4 as worsening Middle East tensions and slowing
car sales in China raised concerns demand may decline. Losses
intensified after the massive earthquake in  Japan .  --Feiwen Rong. Editors:  Richard Dobson , Thomas Kutty Abraham  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
