The Southern African Customs Union,
a group of five countries including  South Africa , agreed to
jointly negotiate future trade agreements, said Rob Davies,
South Africa’s Trade and Industry Minister.  This will include trade talks with  India  and Latin
America’s Mercosur bloc, Davies told reporters today in the
capital, Pretoria, after a SACU heads-of-state meeting. Existing
agreements won’t be affected, he said.  “We’ve finally been able to agree on a set of principles”
to ensure all future trade talks are done collectively, Davies
said.  SACU was formed more than a hundred years ago, giving South
Africa, the continent’s biggest economy, the right to steer
regional policies while sharing customs and excise revenue with
neighboring countries Botswana,  Lesotho , Swaziland,  Namibia .
Income from the union, which makes up more than half of the
budgets of  Swaziland  and  Lesotho , declined in the past two years
because of the global economic crisis.  In 2009, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland signed separate
economic partnership agreements, or EPAs, with the European
Union, angering South Africa.  SACU also agreed to an “urgent” review of terms under
which revenue is shared out among its members, the group’s
Executive Secretary Tswelopele Moreni said today.  Thousands of people marched in Swaziland’s capital, Mbabane
on March 18 to protest against possible job cuts and a civil
service wage freeze as the government struggles to find ways to
deal with a budget crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
