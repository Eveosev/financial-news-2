Hedge funds  and private equity
firms including Paulson & Co., Cerberus Capital Management LP
and Apax Partners LLP have held talks with Spanish savings banks
which are seeking to raise 15 billion euros ($21 billion) in new
capital and avoid a state bailout, the Financial Times reported,
citing unnamed bankers and investors.  The firms have held talks with banks including Bankia and
Banca Civica, the newspaper said. The low valuations placed on
the banks by the investors have caused the process to stall, the
FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
