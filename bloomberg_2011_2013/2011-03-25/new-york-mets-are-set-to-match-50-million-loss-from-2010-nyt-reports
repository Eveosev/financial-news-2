The  New York Mets  lost almost $50
million in 2010 and stand to lose a similar amount this season,
the New York Times said, citing two people familiar with the
Major League Baseball team’s finances.  The owners of the Mets are trying to sell a portion of the
team as they fight a $1 billion lawsuit tied to the Bernard L. Madoff Ponzi scheme.  The Mets contributed about $24 million to baseball’s
revenue-sharing pool in 2010, compared with $40 million two
years ago, the Times said.  Revenue fell by more than $60 million last year, the Times
said. The net loss, after interest, was about $50 million during
2010, the same year the Mets secured a $25 million loan from the
league.  The Mets declined to discuss finances, the New York Times
said. Spokesman Jay Horowitz didn’t respond to an e-mail for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
