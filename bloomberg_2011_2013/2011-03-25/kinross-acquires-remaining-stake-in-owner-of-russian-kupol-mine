Kinross Gold Corp. (K) ,  Canada ’s third-
largest producer of the precious metal, will acquire the
remaining 25 percent it doesn’t already own in Russia’s Kupol
mine.  The Russian Federation’s State Commission for the Control
of Foreign Investments “pre-approved” the deal, Toronto-based
Kinross said today in a statement. Earlier today, Igor Artemyev,
head of Russia’s Anti-Monopoly Service, said Kinross would soon
buy the stake in Kupol developer, ZAO Chukotskaya Mining &
Geological Co., from the Chukotka regional government.  Kinross, which didn’t disclose how much it paid for the
stake, will finance the acquisition with the proceeds from the
sale of shares in Harry Winston Diamond Corp. and with $200
million in non-recourse debt, according to the statement.  The company got a controlling stake in Siberia’s Kupol mine
in 2007 when it bought Bema Gold Corp. for C$4.27 billion ($4.37
billion).  Kinross fell 29 cents, or 1.8 percent, to C$15.76 at 4 p.m.
in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The shares have dropped 17
percent this year.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  and  Goldcorp Inc. (GG)  are the two largest
Canada-based gold producers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
