Rosatom Corp.,  Russia ’s government-
owned nuclear holding company, agreed a contract valued at about
$2.8 billion to supply enriched uranium to the U.S., Russian
state-run newspaper  Rossiyskaya Gazeta  said, citing the company.  The accord includes an option to double supplies, possibly
boosting the value of the deal to $6 billion, Kommersant  said  in
a separate report, citing Rosatom Chief Executive Officer Sergei Kirienko. Sergei Novikov, a spokesman in Moscow for the company,
wasn’t immediately available to comment.  Rosatom’s  Techsnabexport  unit, known as Tenex, agreed a 10-
year deal to supply low-enriched uranium to Bethesda, Maryland-
based  USEC Inc. (USU)  from 2013, the U.S. company said on March 23.  Tenex has previously worked with USEC on the “Megatons for
Megawatts Program,” in which Russia agreed to supply $8 billion
of uranium from dismantled warheads, it said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
