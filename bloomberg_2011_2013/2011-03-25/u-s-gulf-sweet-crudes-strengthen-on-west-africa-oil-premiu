Sweet, or low-sulfur, crudes
strengthened on the  Gulf Coast  as West African grades traded
near the highest premiums over benchmark Dated Brent since July
2008 after Libyan exports were curtailed.  Gulf Coast sweet crudes compete with imports from  Nigeria 
and other West African countries. Gulf differentials
strengthened as Bonny Light’s premium over Brent slipped 5 cents
to $3.83 from a 32-month high reached March 23.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 25 cents to
$12 a barrel at 12:23 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained 50 cents to
$12.50 over the benchmark.  Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades weakened as Russian
Urals crude in Northwest  Europe  fell to a 32-month low versus
Brent. Mars Blend narrowed $1.25 to $7.50 a barrel over WTI.
Poseidon’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $7.75.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened 75 cents to $8.
Thunder Horse lost $1 to $11 a barrel over WTI.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to $3.50 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing.  Canadian Syncrude’s premium gained $1 to $10.75 a barrel.
The discount for Western Canada Select widened 10 cents to $17 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
