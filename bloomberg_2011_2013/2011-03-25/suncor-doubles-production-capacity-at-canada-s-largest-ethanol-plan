Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , a Canadian
energy company, doubled production capacity at its Ontario
ethanol plant.  The company’s St. Clair facility is now Canada’s largest
ethanol plant, Calgary-based Suncor said today in a statement.
The C$120 million ($122 million) expansion project doubled
production capacity to 400 million liters (106 million gallons).  Canada currently requires 5 percent ethanol be blended into
retail gasoline. A similar, 2 percent requirement for biodiesel
is expected to be enacted in coming months, the Canadian
 Renewable Fuels Association  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
