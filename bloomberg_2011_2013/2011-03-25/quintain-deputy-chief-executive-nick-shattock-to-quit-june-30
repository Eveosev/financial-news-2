Quintain Estates & Development Plc (QED) ,
the developer of the area surrounding London’s Wembley stadium
and a site on the Greenwich Peninsular, said Deputy Chief
Executive Nick Shattock resigned and will leave the company on
June 30.  Shattock, 51, will quit “to pursue new opportunities,”
the London-based company said in a statement today.  The executive, who joined Quintain 16 years ago,
spearheaded the company’s regeneration business and Chief
Executive Officer Adrian Wyatt will now oversee these duties,
while Chief Financial Officer Rebecca Worthington will handle
the Greenwich project, the company said.  “This was totally unexpected,” said Daniel Horwood, an
analyst at London-based broker Liberum Capital with a “buy”
recommendation on the stock. “Quintain isn’t a one-man band,
though, and there’s a large team below him.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
