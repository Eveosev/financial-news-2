Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688)  Chairman Jack Ma
“called for the heads” of Chief Executive Officer David Wei
and Chief Operating Officer Elvis Lee after learning some
employees helped clients defraud users, Forbes reported.  Ma told Wei, who subsequently resigned, that he should have
done more to stop the abuses sooner, the  magazine reported.   “This was Forbes’ interpolation,” Alibaba spokesman John Spelich said in an e-mail today. “We stand by what we announced
in February.”  Alibaba, owner of  China ’s biggest online-commerce website
for businesses, said on Feb. 21 that Wei and Lee resigned to
take responsibility for a “systematic breakdown” of integrity.
More than 2,300 vendors used the company’s website to defraud
buyers, and about 100 employees were responsible for letting
sellers create bogus storefronts, Alibaba said. Wei and Lee
weren’t accused of wrongdoing.  Ma said he is “disappointed” about Yahoo! Inc. and
doesn’t trust the U.S. shareholder “after working with them for
years,” according to Forbes. Lisa Tam, a senior public
relations manager at Yahoo in  Hong Kong , said she couldn’t
immediately comment on the report.  Yahoo is the biggest shareholder in Alibaba Group Holding
Ltd., the parent of Hong Kong-listed Alibaba.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
