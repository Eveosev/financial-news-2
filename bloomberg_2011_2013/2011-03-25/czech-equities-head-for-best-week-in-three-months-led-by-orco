Czech stocks rose, extending the
best week in three months, as  Orco Property Group (ORCO)  SA reported
its first full-year profit since 2007 and investors speculated
 CEZ AS (CEZ)  will benefit from higher electricity prices in Germany.  The PX Index of 15 stocks added 0.4 percent to 1,245.4 at
4:28 p.m. in Prague, its highest close since Feb. 16. The gauge
jumped 2.8 percent this week.  Orco rallied 8.9 percent to 244 koruna, its highest close
since September 2009. Net income was 233.4 million euros ($330.7
million) last year, compared with a loss of 250.6 million euros
in 2009, the Luxembourg-registered developer in central  Europe 
said. About 190,000 shares changed hands, more than seven times
the daily average in the past three months.  CEZ, the biggest utility in the Czech Repunlic, advanced
0.8 percent to 863 koruna, its highest close in two months,
extending this week’s gain to 4.1 percent.  Power for next-year delivery today rose to 58.70 euros per
megawatt-hour in neighboring  Germany , the contract’s highest
close since October 2009. The recent gain in Germany’s power
prices may boost CEZ’s sales, Marek Hatlapatka, an analyst at
Cyrrus brokerage, said March 22.  Growing prices after Germany shut down seven atomic
reactors will have a “positive impact” on CEZ’s earnings, Alan Svoboda, CEZ’s trading director, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
