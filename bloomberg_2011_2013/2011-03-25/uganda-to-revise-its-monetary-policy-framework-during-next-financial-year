Uganda ’s central bank will revise
its monetary policy framework at the beginning of the country’s
next financial year, Bank of Uganda Deputy Governor Louis
Kasekende said.  The bank will use repo and reverse-repos to manage
liquidity, and use Treasury bills and bonds for government
financing, Kasekende said in a videolink posted on the Kampala-
based bank’s website. Bonds and Treasury bills have previously
been used primarily to conduct monetary policy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
