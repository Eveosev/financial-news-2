Belgium ’s federal government may
need to cut spending or raise taxes by 50 percent after
transferring 10 billion euros ($14 billion) of revenue to the
nation’s regions,  De Tijd reported , citing a planning bureau
report.  Belgium’s regional governments will have to take over part
of the national debt or agree to finance as much as 40 percent
of additional spending powers without transfers from federal
coffers to keep Belgian government finances from spiraling out
of control, the newspaper said. Without transfers to the
regions, the federal entity will have to rein in expenditure or
raise taxes by 36 percent by 2015, according to  De Tijd , which
cited calculations from the federal planning bureau.  To contact the reporters on this story:
