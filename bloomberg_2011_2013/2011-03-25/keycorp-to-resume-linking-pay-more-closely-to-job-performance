KeyCorp (KEY) ,  Ohio ’s second-biggest
bank, will resume linking executive pay more closely to
performance after it repays a $2.5 billion taxpayer bailout.  The compensation adjustment was among recommendations
suggested by the lender’s board in December, Cleveland-based
KeyCorp said today in a statement. Implementation of the
guidelines also would settle a shareholder suit filed against
the bank last year over 2009 executive pay, the bank said.
KeyCorp was accused of violating fiduciary duties and committing
corporate waste, according to a regulatory filing.  “While not admitting the validity of any allegations,”
KeyCorp said it and the plaintiffs had reached a settlement that
awaits court approval, according to the statement. Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Henry L. Meyer III, incoming CEO Beth Mooney and Tom Stevens, vice chairman, were among those named in
the suit.  Meyer was asked by Mooney to remain with the bank as a non-
executive employee for up to another year, according to the
statement. His stock and compensation until Mooney takes over on
May 1 will be an annualized $3 million, the same as last year,
the bank said. Then he will be paid $240,000.  The bank sold $1 billion in bonds March 21 to help repay
borrowings under the U.S. Treasury Department’s Troubled Asset
Relief Program.  To contact the reporter for this story:
