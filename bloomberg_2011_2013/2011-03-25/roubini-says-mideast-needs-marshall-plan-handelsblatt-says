Nouriel Roubini , the economist who
predicted the global financial crisis, said a new Marshall Plan-
style fund should be set up for North Africa and the Middle East
to stabilize regional economies, according to an article he
wrote in  Handelsblatt .  Roubini the fund would be stocked by money from the
 International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and would prevent a
“deadly combination” of weak growth and sharply accelerating
inflation, Handelsblatt reported.  The  Marshall Plan  ran from 1947 to 1951 and used U.S. funds
to rebuild Europe in the wake of World War II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
