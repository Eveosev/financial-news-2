(Corrects second paragraph to show flaring isn’t associated
with refinery.)  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  plans to flare
gases in  Baton Rouge ,  Louisiana , because of routine maintenance,
Curt Monte, a spokesman for the Baton Rouge fire department,
said in a telephone interview. The fire department received a
notification earlier today, he said.  The flaring wasn’t planned for Exxon’s Baton Rouge refinery
or chemical plant, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman, said in
an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
