Japan ’s Nuclear and Industrial
Safety Agency ordered Tokyo Electric Power Co. to improve
radiation monitoring at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant
to ensure that more workers are not exposed to radiation.  Three workers were contaminated yesterday because an
“appropriate survey had not been carried out” before work to
restore power to the reactors started, Hidehiko Nishiyama, a
spokesman for the agency, said at a briefing today.  The workers were contaminated after stepping in water at
the turbine building of the No. 3 reactor. The water had
radiation levels 10,000 times higher than water used in reactor
cooling, Nishiyama said.  The agency plans to replace the sea water being used to
cool the reactors with fresh water, as sea water contains
impurities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
