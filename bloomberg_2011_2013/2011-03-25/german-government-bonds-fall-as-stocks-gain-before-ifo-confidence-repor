German 10-year  government bonds 
fell, paring their first weekly gain in three, as advances in
stock markets damped demand for the relative safety of
government debt.  Two-year notes were headed for their first weekly decline
in three. The Munich-based Ifo institute’s business climate
index was at 110.5 this month, after climbing to a record 111.2
in February, according to the median estimate of 39 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey before today’s release. The rate of
growth in M3  money supply , which the European Central Bank uses
as a gauge of future inflation, was 1.7 percent last month, up
from 1.5 percent in January, a survey of economists showed
before the ECB release today.  The 10-year bund yield increased three basis points to
3.27 percent as of 7:59 a.m. in London while yields on two-year
notes were two basis points higher at 1.70 percent. The 10-year
yield has increased eight basis points since March 18.  The  MSCI AC Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index rose 0.8 percent, while
Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Index climbed 1.1 percent.  German government bonds have handed investors a loss of 1.8
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
