The European Union appealed a World
Trade Organization ruling saying the bloc’s method of applying
extra duties on imports of Chinese iron or steel fasteners it
considers to be unfairly priced breaks global trade law.  WTO judges  ruled  in December that the EU’s policy of
imposing a single blanket duty on imports discriminates against
Chinese exporters of the screws and bolts. The win was  China ’s
first against the EU at the WTO. A European Commission
spokeswoman said the bloc appealed the ruling in Geneva today.  The ruling quashed a key policy by the EU in dealing with
imports from countries it deems not to be market economies, such
as China, Vietnam and Cuba. Unless the Geneva-based WTO backs
the EU appeal, the case may have broader implications by
compelling the 27-nation bloc to start imposing anti-dumping
tariffs on a company-by-company basis.  The initial WTO panel offered specific remedies for the EU
to take on some points and declined to make recommendations on
others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
