Sheila Bair , the chairman of the
U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., suggested mortgage lenders
should look at paying borrowers in arrears large cash sums to
vacate their homes, the Financial Times reported.  At a meeting between regulators and the five biggest U.S.
mortgage servicers on March 21, Bair suggested the lenders
should offer borrowers more than 90 days behind with payments
$1,000 to seek independent financial advice and $20,000 as a
“fresh start” inducement to surrender keys, the newspaper
said, citing unidentified people who were present.  The “cash-for-keys” idea, aimed at ending the foreclosure
crisis, hasn’t been adopted by the government and received a
hostile reception from some of the banks, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
