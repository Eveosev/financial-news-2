WestLB AG, the state-owned German
lender bailed out during the financial crisis, said its loss
narrowed last year after it set aside less money for bad loans.  The net loss was 240 million euros ($340 million), compared
with a deficit of 531 million euros in 2009, Dusseldorf-based
WestLB said in a statement today. Provisions for loan losses
dropped 70 percent to 242 million euros.  The lender needed bailouts from its owners, including the
German state of North Rhine Westphalia and the country’s federal
government, after running up losses during the global financial
crisis. WestLB is seeking a buyer under conditions set by the
European Union for approving the aid and said today that sale
discussions with two bidders continue. Its owners last month
submitted restructuring proposals for the bank to the European
Commission, the EU’s executive arm.  “WestLB has proven in 2010 that its business model
works,” Chief Executive Officer Dietrich Voigtlaender said in
the statement. “We have strengthened our customer business and
increased our client base, despite difficult conditions.”  WestLB’s core capital ratio, a measure of financial
strength, rose to 11.4 percent at the end of last year after it
reduced risk-weighted assets, from 8.2 percent at the end of
2009 and 6.4 percent at the end of 2008.  Risk-weighted assets are forecast to decline to 41 billion
euros by 2015 from 52 billion euros by the end of March this
year, the bank said today. Total assets will probably drop to 83
billion euros by 2015 from 125 billion euros by the end of
March.  WestLB also expects sales of 1.15 billion euros at its main
business by 2015, compared with 1.42 billion euros last year,
while pretax profit at the main operations will probably fall to
319 million euros that year from 446 million euros in 2010, it
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
