Britain’s new tax on carbon-dioxide
may fail to reduce power generation from coal, according to
Evolution Securities.  Gas prices have been trading at about the coal equivalence
price, where the cost to produce power using the two fuels is
comparable, and are likely to continue to do so, Lakis
Athanasiou, a London-based Evolution Securities analyst, said
today by telephone.  “Summer natural gas prices are around the U.K. coal
equivalence price as far ahead as 2014,” Athanasiou said.
“That’s a visible pricing point that buyers and sellers are
clustering around on the forward curves.”  Chancellor  George Osborne  fixed March 23 the carbon tax at
4.94 pounds ($7.94) a metric ton from 2013, to raise revenue and
prompt the use of cleaner-burning fuels for power generation.
 Drax Group Plc (DRX) , owner of Britain’s largest coal-fed plant,
plummeted as much as 8 percent after the announcement on concern
the profitability of coal-fired plants, or dark green spread,
would fall.  “The negative reaction of Drax’s share price is wrong,”
Athanasiou said. “We expect that the share price will come back
up when we see the impacts of the higher CO2 prices feeding
through to electricity and gas prices, shoring up the hit on the
dark green spread.”  Drax rose 7 pence, or 1.9 percent, to 379 pence as of 11:30
a.m in London. Athanasiou has a neutral recommendation for Drax
and a price target of 410 pence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
