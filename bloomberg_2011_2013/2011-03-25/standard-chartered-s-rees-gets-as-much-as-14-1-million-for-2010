Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s Mike Rees,
head of corporate banking, may be paid as much as $14.1 million
for 2010, making him the highest-paid director on the board.  The total includes a salary of $926,000 and $6.6 million in
deferred shares, the London-based company said in its  annual
report  published today. The package amounts to a 6 percent
increase on his $13.3 million package for 2009.  Rees’s division contributes about three-quarters of the
bank’s profit and includes investment banking activities such as
equities, and mergers and advisory services. In November,
Standard Chartered decided not to join a pact between U.K. banks
and the government to restrain bonuses for 2010 because 97
percent of its staff are based outside Britain.  The bank this month reported its seventh successive year of
record profit. Net income at  Standard Chartered , which focuses
on  Asia , the Middle East and  Africa , rose 28 percent to $4.33
billion. Operating profit in the corporate-banking, or
“wholesale” unit climbed 17 percent to $4.77 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Peter Sands may get compensation
totaling as much as $7.8 million, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
