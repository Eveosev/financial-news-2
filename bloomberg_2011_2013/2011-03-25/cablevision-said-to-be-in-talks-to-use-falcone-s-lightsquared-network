Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)  is in
discussions with Philip Falcone’s LightSquared Inc. about a deal
to use the venture’s network to offer wireless services to its
customers, according to a person familiar with the situation.  No deal has been reached, according to the person, who
declined to be identified because the negotiations are private.
LightSquared, backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners
hedge fund, is building a wireless network with so-called
fourth-generation technology to compete with  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Verizon
Wireless  and  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)   Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , Cablevision’s rival in the New York
area, is also in talks to use LightSquared’s network, two people
familiar with the situation said this week.  Cablevision, based in Bethpage,  New York , could use the
access to offer expanded wireless capability to its Internet,
television and telephone customers. LightSquared has also
announced deals with retailer Best Buy Co. and pay-as-you-go
mobile-phone carrier Leap Wireless International Inc.  Jim Maiella, a Cablevision spokesman, and Audrey Schaefer,
a spokeswoman for LightSquared, declined to comment.  Cablevision shares fell $0.01 at $34.85 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 3
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
