Colombia ’s peso rose for the third
week this month as faster-than-forecast economic growth overcame
efforts by the central bank to limit the currency’s
appreciation.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,870.73 per  U.S.
dollar  today, from 1874.01 on March 18. The currency weakened
0.3 percent today from yesterday.  “We had supremely robust growth numbers, higher than
market expectations,” said Wilson Tovar, head of research at
brokerage Acciones y Valores SA in Bogota.  “We expect this
boost in internal demand and investment will be maintained,
particularly from the energy sector, which puts pressure on the
currency to appreciate.”  The peso was boosted by a report yesterday that showed the
economy expanded 4.6 percent in the last three months of 2010
from a year earlier, exceeding forecasts for 4.1 percent
expansion, and an upgrade to the nation’s credit rating last
week by  Standard & Poor’s .  In a bid to ease gains in the local currency, the central
bank began buying a minimum of $20 million a day on Sept. 15
through auctions that will last “at least” through June 17.  The peso has dropped 3.4 percent since the daily dollar
purchases began.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 11 percent bonds
due July 2020 fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
8.329 percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
