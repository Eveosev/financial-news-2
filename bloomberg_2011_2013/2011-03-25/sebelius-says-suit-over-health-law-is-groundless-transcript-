U.S. Health and Human Services
Secretary  Kathleen Sebelius  said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,”
airing this weekend, that a legal challenge to President
Barack Obama’s health-care overhaul by a group aligned with
Republican strategist Karl Rove is groundless.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Health and Human
Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Thank you for being
with us, Madam Secretary.  KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Great to be back.  HUNT: The health care bill, the administration said
once it started to take effect, people would have a more
favorable view. It’s a year old now. Polls show still most
Americans either don’t like it or don’t think it will
really improve health care. Is that because the
administration has done a poor job selling it? Or are there
just too many flaws in the bill?  SEBELIUS: I don’t think it’s either. I think that the
early features of the bill affect a relatively small number
of Americans. A lot of people still don’t know how they are
going to connect with the new Affordable Care Act.  HUNT: So when will it turn around?  SEBELIUS: Well, I think - I think, you know, we’ll see
things building to 2014, when the new marketplace will be
in place. But I can tell you, Al, I travel all over the
country, and parents with children with pre-existing health
conditions definitely know about the bill and are thrilled
that their children finally will have health coverage.
Parents with young adult kids know about it. Seniors -  HUNT: So you don’t think it’ll be an albatross for
 Barack Obama  in his seeking re-election?  SEBELIUS: Well, I know that the opponents would like
to continue to drive the misinformation about the bill, but
I think each and every day some of those myths are
dispelled, and that’s good news. Seniors now know Medicare
is stronger. They’ve got new benefits.  HUNT: Is that it won’t be an albatross?  SEBELIUS: Well, I don’t think - I think he is proud of
the work that we’ve done, and we’ll continue to implement
the bill in ways that will impact people positively.  HUNT: Speaker Boehner and Minority Senate Leader
McConnell this week in an op-ed, I think in the Cincinnati
paper, said that this bill’s going to cost 800,000 jobs -
they’re citing CBO figures - over the next decade.  SEBELIUS: Well, the figures that they’re citing are
the CBO saying that it is possible that some people will
choose to retire early because they no longer will be
desperately clinging to their job only to have health
coverage. So, in fact, this is a freedom that people will
have. They can change jobs -  HUNT: So you think they’re -  SEBELIUS:  - leave jobs, live their lives the way they
want. That’s the 800,000. It isn’t a job loss. It’s
actually Americans having more freedom to choose, to start
a business, or have the jobs they want, because they don’t
have to be tied to the health care associated with one job.  HUNT: Let me talk about your administration of this
measure. You granted the state of  Maine  a waiver from the
requirement that plans have to spend I think 80 cents of
every dollar of individual premium revenue on patient care.
 Florida  has asked for a waiver now. And all the analysts
say this is the big one. If Florida gets it, you know, just
about every state has to get it. They have six insurers
that cover I think about 85 percent. Will Florida likely
get a waiver? And when will you make the decision?  SEBELIUS: Well, I think the staff is taking a careful
look, which we’re recommended to do. We need data from the
state. The Maine situation is pretty unique, Al. Maine has
two insurers, one of which has 30 percent of the
population, and said we will actually leave the market, we
will not offer individual coverage -  HUNT: And that situation doesn’t exist in Florida?  SEBELIUS: No. It exists almost nowhere else in the
country.  HUNT: Do you have any idea when you’ll make the
Florida decision?  SEBELIUS: I think when they get the data together -  HUNT: What are we, weeks or months away?  SEBELIUS: Probably months. I really - I really can’t
tell you. I know they’re actively working on it.  HUNT: Speaking of waivers, Crossroads Global Policy
Strategy, spearheaded by  Karl Rove , is suing you,
suggesting that some of the waivers you’ve granted various
companies and unions are politically motivated.  SEBELIUS: I just think - nothing is further from the
truth. There have been about 1,000 waivers given for one
section of the bill, where we were given specific direction
by Congress to say look carefully at market disruptions. So
there a lot of policies in place which are pretty limited
benefits, mini-med plans that offer some coverage, not
comprehensive coverage -  HUNT: But no politics in there?  SEBELIUS: No. Ninety-six percent of the people who
came forward got a waiver because they met the criteria.
The ones who have been rejected just didn’t fall within the
market disruption statistics. And some coverage is better
than no coverage, so -  HUNT: Let’s turn to fiscal issues. House Budget
Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan  and his roadmap budget would
turn Medicare into a voucher system. He says it’s more
efficient, it’ll cost less, and it’ll be more competitive.  SEBELIUS: Well, I think vouchers can be very
dangerous, depending on what your individual health
condition is and what your sophistication is. So if you are
a seriously chronically ill elderly person without a real
ability to navigate a complicated health system, you’re
going to be in very serious shape without a guaranteed set
of benefits -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: And that’s what the Ryan proposal would do?  SEBELIUS: It absolutely would do that. You’d be on
your own to figure out your own health care.  HUNT: You know, one of the things that Republican
critics also say is that you were - last year, you sort of
teased and said we’ll look at medical malpractice, but then
you’ve just dropped it. They’re adamant that some kind of
medical malpractice reform has to be achieved. Are you
going to get behind any proposal this year in that area?  SEBELIUS: Well, again, we currently have 13 projects
around the country. It isn’t that we ducked it at all. We
funded health system, court systems, others to really look
at what works.  And, Al, the data is very inconclusive. States that
have this full range of limitations on courts, some of them
have very high insurance rates, some of them have very low
insurance rates. The president has said all along, we want
to look at patient safety, we want to look at malpractice
rates for doctors, and we want to look at overall
settlements that move quickly.  He’s proposed in his budget another huge set of
projects run by the -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: But not ready for a federal - for a change in
federal law on that yet?  SEBELIUS: Well, actually, the president really doesn’t
support federalizing state law.  HUNT: OK. Let me - another thing. The president has
said that a model for your health care bill was the
 Massachusetts  plan enacted under Governor Romney. Governor
Romney says, no, no, there’s no comparison. He had a state
mandate. That’s different. That’s flexible. It could work
in Massachusetts and not  Texas . That’s not the same as your
mandate. He had business support, no tax increase. Does he
have a point?  SEBELIUS: Well, I think it’s very ironic. There’s no
question that the framework looks very much like
Massachusetts, bringing everybody in. The one piece that
the Affordable Care Act did inspired by the Massachusetts
experience is we dealt with some of the cost issues at the
same time we were dealing with access issues. Anybody in
Massachusetts will tell you they made a huge mistake. They
looked at access only, and now they’re revisiting - thanks
to Governor Patrick and others and leaders in the business
community - how you will actually lower costs.  HUNT: So Romney -  SEBELIUS: And they did it as a two-step -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: Romneycare was the forerunner of Obamacare?  SEBELIUS: Well, I think there’s no question that the
framework of having exchanges, having universal access,
working on coverage for everyone, but, again, the
Affordable Care Act includes a major initiative looking at
cost controls at the same time.  HUNT: If Barack Obama is re-elected and asked you to
stay in government service, would you do it?  SEBELIUS: I - I am definitely staying, you know, to
fulfill the mission of the agency that I’m running. It’s
incredibly important work. I’m very excited about the
challenges that this president has taken on that have been
tried for decades. And, you know, we haven’t gotten to a
“what happens 10 years down the road” future, but every day
I’m working hard and love what I do.  HUNT: You’re going to be here through 2012? And then
we see from there?  SEBELIUS: Absolutely, yes, absolutely.  HUNT: Okay. Kathleen Sebelius, thank you so much for
joining us.  SEBELIUS: Sure.  HUNT: And when we come back, NATO takes control of air
strikes in  Libya , but not without American help. We’ll talk
to our reporters next.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
