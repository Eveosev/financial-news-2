American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out insurer, posted the worst underwriting results
for the second straight year among 25 firms as it added to
reserves after underestimating claims in prior years.  The New York-based insurer paid about $1.29 on claims and
expenses for every dollar it received in premiums in 2010, the
highest among a group of U.S. property and casualty carriers,
according to a study released today by A.M. Best. The 25
insurers paid about $1.01 on average for every dollar in
premiums.  AIG was forced to bolster reserves in the fourth quarter of
2010 after determining it put aside insufficient funds to cover
claims on casualty policies sold in prior years. Rivals
including New York-based Travelers Cos. and  Chubb Corp. (CB)  of
Warren,  New Jersey  have booked profits after determining theyâ€™d
set aside more than needed.  In 2009, AIG paid $1.10 on claims and expenses for every
dollar it collected in premiums, the worst among the 25
insurers, according to a study that year by A.M. Best. The group
of insurers paid about 99 cents on average for every dollar in
premiums in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
