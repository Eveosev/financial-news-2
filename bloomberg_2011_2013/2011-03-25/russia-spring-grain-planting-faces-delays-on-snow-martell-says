Russia’s spring-grain production
may be less than expected as a deep snow cover in the country’s
northern growing regions delays planting, forecaster  Martell
Crop Projections  said.  The country’s northern grain areas received “very heavy
snow” over the winter into last week that hasn’t melted yet,
Gail Martell, head of the Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin-based
forecaster, said yesterday in an e-mailed report.  Russia banned all grain exports in August after a drought
that Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said destroyed 13 million
hectares (32.1 million acres) of crops. The snow pack that
accumulated over winter contains an estimated 5 to 6 inches  of
water, enough to fully replenish soil moisture after last year’s
drought, according to Martell.  “The problem is fields will become saturated as they
slowly thaw in April,” Martell said. “It may require several
weeks for sodden fields to warm up and dry out. Spring seeding
may be delayed by three, four weeks.”  A planting delay is “not a good situation in a northern
climate, where the growing season is relatively short,” and
could hurt crop yields, the forecaster said. Getting grains
planted may be “a struggle” with a delayed and heavy snow
melt, according to Martell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
