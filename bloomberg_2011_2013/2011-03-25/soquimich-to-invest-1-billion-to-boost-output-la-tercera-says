Soc. Quimica y Minera de  Chile  SA,
Chile’s largest fertilizer producer known as Soquimich, plans to
invest $1 billion over the next four years to boost production,
La Tercera reported.   Sales may rise to about $2 billion this year and profit
probably will exceed last year’s $382 million, the Santiago-
based newspaper cited Chief Executive Patricio Contesse as
saying.  Soquimich plans to increase annual potassium chloride
output to 2 million metric tons by 2014 from 1.7 million tons,
while production of potassium nitrate will rise to 1.2 million
tons, La Tercera reported. Iodine output will reach 14,000 tons,
Contesse was quoted as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
