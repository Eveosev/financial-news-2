A portrait of Pedro Martinez, one
of five Major League Baseball pitchers to win Cy Young Awards in
both leagues, will go on display today at the Smithsonian’s
 National Portrait Gallery  in  Washington .  The  portrait  was created by American painter Susan Miller-
Havens in 2000 with oil and beeswax on Baltic birch and measures
57 inches by 21 inches. It’s a gift to the museum from MLB
Network analyst Peter Gammons and will be included in the
exhibition “Recent Acquisitions.”  Martinez played in the major leagues from 1992-2009 and won
three Cy Young awards as the best pitcher in his league. He won
his first Cy Young in the National League with Montreal in 1997
and two more in the American League with the Boston Red Sox in
1999 and 2000. Roy Halladay,  Roger Clemens ,  Randy Johnson  and
Gaylord Perry are the only other pitchers to win Cy Young awards
in both leagues.  Martinez, 39, had a career  219-100 record  with a 2.93
earned run average with the Expos,  Red Sox , Los Angeles Dodgers,
New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies.  Martinez also has worked to promote educational
opportunities for underprivileged children in the U.S. and his
native Dominican Republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
