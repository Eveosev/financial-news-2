Indonesia ’s rupiah completed its
second weekly advance on speculation the central bank is
tolerating gains to curb inflation.  The currency traded near the strongest level in almost four
years after global funds bought $98 million more Indonesian
stocks than they sold yesterday, exchange data show. The
nation’s lawmakers voted to delay planned cuts to fuel subsidies
on concern higher  oil prices  will cause inflation to accelerate,
Teuku Rifky Harsya, chairman of the parliamentary commission for
energy affairs, said March 21.  “Bank Indonesia is happy with the rupiah strengthening,”
said Mika Martumpal, a senior market analyst at PT Bank
Commonwealth in Jakarta. “The investment into stocks this week
has also been strong.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.7 percent this week to 8,707 per
dollar as of 3:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was up 0.1 percent today. The currency touched
8,703 on March 23, the strongest level since May 2007.  Indonesia’s central bank sees  core inflation  possibly
increasing in March due to rising commodity prices, while
headline inflation may fall as food price have declined, Perry Warjiyo,  Bank Indonesia ’s director of economic research today
said.  “That’s why Bank Indonesia has allowed the rupiah to
strengthen,” he told reporters. “That would reduce imported
inflation.  Consumer prices rose 6.84 percent in February from a year
earlier, the least in three months, official figures show.
January’s 7.02 percent increase was the biggest since April 2009.  The yield on the 8.25 percent bond due July 2021 dropped 20
basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, this week to 8.13 percent,
according to midday prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  Overseas funds increased their holdings of Indonesian
government debt to 203 trillion rupiah ($23 billion) as of March
21, from 196 trillion rupiah at the end of last year, according
to the  finance ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
