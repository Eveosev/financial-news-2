Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said he’s “not particularly concerned” about events
in  Japan  derailing the U.S. economic recovery.  “The principal concern that we have should be with the
immediate humanitarian” needs in Japan, Geithner told reporters
today on a trip to a company factory in Springdale,  Arkansas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
