Tokyo  Governor Shintaro Ishihara
criticized Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s response to the crisis at
its nuclear power station north of the Japanese capital that was
damaged in the earthquake and tsunami on March 11.  “Their response has been no good at all,” Ishihara told
reporters today after meeting the governor of Fukushima
prefecture, Yuhei Sato, in the city of the same name 240
kilometers (150 miles) north of the capital. “It’s been slow.”  Repairs at the site of the worst nuclear disaster since
Chernobyl in 1986 have been plagued by explosions, fires and
leaks of toxic material. Ishihara criticized the company known
as Tepco for not using sea water earlier to cool reactors after
backup generators failed.  “Had they used sea water from the start we wouldn’t be in
this situation,” Ishihara said.  He said it was necessary for  Japan  to keep using nuclear
power even as the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, hit by the tsunami
that followed the magnitude-9 earthquake, has raised concerns
over nuclear safety.  “Japan is a resource-poor country, where thermal and hydro
power have their limits, so we simply cannot do without atomic
energy,” Ishihara said. “In other countries, nuclear power is
under government control, but in Japan, the  utility companies 
run the show. This turned out to be a negative factor, slowing
the response.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
