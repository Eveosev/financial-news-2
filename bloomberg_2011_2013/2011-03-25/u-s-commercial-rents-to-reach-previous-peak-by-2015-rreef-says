U.S. commercial rents will reach
their former peak levels by 2015, with growth in office and
warehouse rates surpassing the apartment sector in two years,
according to a forecast by RREEF.  Buildings in  New York , San Francisco,  Boston , San Diego and
 San Jose ,  California , will have some of the strongest growth
after office rents fell 4.9 percent nationally last year, Alan Billingsley, head of research for RREEF, an investment unit of
 Deutsche Bank AG (DB) , said yesterday at a conference in San
Francisco.  “Net operating income is still moving downward, but when
rent growth starts, it really takes off,” Billingsley said.  U.S. commercial property prices fell 4.3 percent from a
year earlier in January, the second straight monthly decline, as
distressed sales in all sectors held back values, the
Moody’s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index showed March 22.
The delinquency rate on loans packaged as commercial mortgage-
backed securities rose to a record 9.2 percent in February,
Moody’s said March 15.  Property in technology-driven markets including Seattle and
Austin,  Texas , are among RREEF’s most favored investments,
according to Billingsley. Rental housing in “youth magnet”
coastal cities that attract workers born between 1981 and 1995,
estimated at 60 million people, will also get a boost this
decade, he said.  Office Buildings  Apartments rents, which increased as millions of U.S.
homeowners were foreclosed upon and forced to find other places
to live, are projected to grow 4 percent this year and 5 percent
in both 2012 and 2013, RREEF estimates. Offices and industrial
buildings take the lead in growth in 2013, at 5.1 percent and
5.9 percent respectively.  Office rents will advance 7.7 percent in 2014 and 8 percent
in 2015, while industrial rates gain 7.3 percent and 6.3 percent
and apartments lag behind at 3 percent and 2 percent, according
to Billingsley, who made the presentation at a conference
sponsored by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts, a Washington-based trade group.  Retail will trail other sectors until 2014, when its 3.5
percent growth rate will surpass apartments, RREEF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
