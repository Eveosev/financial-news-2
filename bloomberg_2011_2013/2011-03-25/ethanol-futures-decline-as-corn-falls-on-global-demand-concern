Ethanol futures declined in  Chicago 
as corn dropped on concern global demand for the grain may wane.  The grain-based additive followed corn lower on speculation
consumption from  Japan  could suffer as the country battled to
avoid a meltdown at its Fukushima plant and as unrest swept
across the Middle East and Africa. Ethanol is made from corn in
the U.S.  “Ethanol was hampered by the volatility in corn,
particularly in the physical markets, with both sides of the
market unable to stick to numbers as prices whipped around,”
analysts at SCB & Associates LLC wrote in a note to clients.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slipped 1.1 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $2.504 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 63 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago jumped 6.5 cents,
or 2.6 percent, to $2.54 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel
increased 6 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.63, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast gained 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.725 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive rose 2
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.665.  Corn for May delivery fell 13 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$6.895 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes about 2.75 gallons
of ethanol.  An average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is losing 8 cents on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 13
cents, according to Ag Trader Talk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
