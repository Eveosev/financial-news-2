Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) ’s loans rose 16
percent in 2010, boosted by lending to corporate clients, said
Seyi Kumapayi, chief financial officer at the Nigerian lender.  The bank last year sold 13.2 billion naira ($85 million) of
non-performing loans to the Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria ,
Kumapayi said on a conference call today. Amcon, as the company
is known, was set up by the government to buy debts from
lenders. Access on March 22 reported pretax profit of 16.2
billion naira for the year through December, below a median
estimate of 16.4 billion naira by five analysts polled by
Bloomberg.  “Aggregate contributions to group profit before tax by
subsidiaries was negative due to provisions on loans
particularly in Cote d’Ivoire,” the bank said in an e-mailed
presentation statement.  Nigerian lenders cut loans after a debt crisis in 2008 and
2009 threatened to collapse the industry. The  Central Bank  of
Nigeria fired the chief executives of eight of the country’s 24
lenders, and bailed out the industry with 620 billion naira.
Access, which passed the central bank’s audit, didn’t receive a
bailout.  Access reduced its non-performing loan ratio to 8.1 percent
in 2010, from 19 percent a year earlier, Kumapayi said. The bank
plans to lower it to 7.5 percent in 2011, he said.  Net Income Return  The lender returned to profit in the year, reporting net
income of 11.1 billion naira from a loss of 4.4 billion naira a
year earlier, it said in a separate statement on the Nigerian
Stock Exchange’s website.  Access has units in  Ivory Coast , the  Democratic Republic of
Congo , Gambia and  Ghana . Others are in Rwanda,  Sierra Leone , the
United Kingdom and Zambia, according to its website. Nigeria
accounted for 94 percent of the lender’s profit before tax last
year, it said. Three countries were profitable, “with three
others recording marginal losses,” it said.  For the loss-making units, Access has embarked on a cost-
cutting process that will return them to profitability in 2011,
Kumapayi said in answer to a question.  The stock fell a second day, losing 26 kobo, or 2.9
percent, to 8.64 naira, by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. Access
has fallen 9.1 percent this year, underperforming the  Nigerian
Stock Exchange ’s All-Share Index, which has gained 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
