President Richard W. Fisher said U.S. monetary policy was at
risk of over-extension.  “We’ve done enough, we’re at risk of doing too much,” the
regional bank chief, who votes on monetary policy this year,
said in a speech today in Brussels.  “We’re not the instrument of the fiscal authorities or
other political authorities in the U.S.,” Fisher said at a
luncheon hosted by the Bruegel research institute. “No central
banker wants to become the instrument of a lecherous congress or
parliament.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
