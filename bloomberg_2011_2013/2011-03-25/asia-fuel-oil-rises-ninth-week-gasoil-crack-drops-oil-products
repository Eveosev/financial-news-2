Asia  fuel oil  rose for the ninth
week, the longest gaining streak since May 2004, as demand for
power-generation fuels increased in Japan following the March 11
earthquake. Naphtha refining margins climbed, while gasoil
profits declined.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose 0.5 percent to
$655.20 a metric ton, gaining for the ninth week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the longest stretch since May
21, 2004. The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as
marine fuel, advanced 0.4 percent this week to $639.50 a ton.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or the crack spread,
shrank 11 percent to $7.87 a barrel this week, Bloomberg data
showed. The viscosity spread, or the premium of 180-centistoke
fuel oil to 380-centistoke fuel oil, climbed 45 cents to $15.70
a ton.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  rose 1.5
percent this week to $995 a ton, the first gain since March 4,
according to Bloomberg data.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the
crack spread, rose to $124.15 a ton from $109.67 a ton at the
end of Asian trading March 18, Bloomberg data showed.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline rose for the second week, gaining
0.5 percent to $120.45 a barrel. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha
fell 90 cents this week to $11.60 a barrel, Bloomberg data
showed. A narrower reforming margin means the profit from
turning naphtha into gasoline is falling.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 50,000 barrels of 97-RON
gasoline loading April 18 to April 22 from PetroChina Co. at
$123.90 a barrel and purchased a second similar cargo of 97-RON
from the Chinese refiner at $124 a barrel. Vitol Group sold
50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline loading April 14 to April 18
to Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. at $120.50 a barrel.  BP Plc bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-half May
delivery from Vitol Group at $997 a ton. Noble Group bought a
similar naphtha cargo from Koch Industries Inc. at $997 a ton.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur, fell 1.1
percent this week to $132 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.
Jet fuel dropped 0.9 percent to $133.55 a barrel.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude fell 4.4 percent this week,
the most since Feb. 25, to $22.55 a barrel, Bloomberg data
showed.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose 30 cents to $1.55 a
barrel this week, Bloomberg data showed. A wider regrade means
it’s more profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Cargill Inc. bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 500-
parts-per-million of sulfur from PetroChina at a premium of
$2.90 a barrel over prices of gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur.
The cargo was for loading April 20 to April 24.  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or
Unipec, bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.25 percent
sulfur from Vitol at a premium of $1.40 a barrel over prices of
gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur. The cargo was for loading April
20 to April 24.  Unipec also bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5
percent sulfur loading April 9 to April 13 from Shell at parity
to Platts prices.  Hin Leong bought 100,000 barrels of jet fuel loading April
14 to April 18 from Shell at a premium of 30 cents over Platts
prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
