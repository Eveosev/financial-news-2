The U.S. soccer team will face
 World Cup  and European champion Spain in a June 4 exhibition
game in Foxborough, Massachusetts.  The match at Gillette Stadium will be Americans’ final
warm-up for the CONCACAF Gold Cup. It’s the first meeting
between the teams since a 2-0 U.S. win in the semifinals of the
2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa.  “Spain is clearly one of the most talented teams in the
world,” U.S. coach Bob Bradley said in a  statement . “We value
the opportunity to test ourselves against a team of their
quality, and we couldn’t ask for a better match to prepare for
the Gold Cup.”  The U.S. opens play in the Gold Cup, the championship for
the North, Central America and Caribbean region, against  Canada 
on June 7 in Detroit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
