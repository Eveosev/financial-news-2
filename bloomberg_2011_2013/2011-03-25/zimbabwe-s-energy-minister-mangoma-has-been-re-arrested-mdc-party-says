Zimbabwe ’s Energy Minister Elton Mangoma was re-arrested and indicted today on more charges of
abusing his office, about two weeks after being released on
bail.  Mangoma was picked up by the police from his Harare home
today, his Movement for Democratic Change party, which is led by
Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai , said in an e-mailed statement.  Mangoma will face trial on July 18 for allegedly canceling
a state tender, Magistrate Kudakwashe Jarabini said in the High
Court today, without giving details. This is in addition to a
March 28 trial for awarding a fuel supply contract without going
through a tender process.  Mangoma is a senior member of the MDC, which has been in a
power-sharing government with  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front Tsvangirai since 2009. Tsvangirai
condemned the first arrest as being politically motivated,
saying it “strikes at the heart” of the coalition agreement.  Mangoma will be held in custody and can apply for bail,
Jarabini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
