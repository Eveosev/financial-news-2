South Africa ’s National Treasury
Director-General Lesetja Kganyago will leave his post, the Mail &
Guardian reported, without saying where it got the information.  The announcement is expected to be made at a special media
briefing called by President  Jacob Zuma  and Finance Minister
 Pravin Gordhan  later today, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said on its website today.  Kganyago renewed his contract for two years until January
2012 and has said he won’t extend it further. Treasury
spokeswoman Lindani Mbunyuza declined to comment when called by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
