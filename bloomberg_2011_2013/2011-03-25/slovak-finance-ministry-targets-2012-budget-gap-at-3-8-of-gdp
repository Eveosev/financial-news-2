Slovakia’s  Finance Ministry  wants
to lower the 2012 budget-deficit target to 3.8 percent of gross
domestic product from 4.9 percent this year, Finance Minister
Ivan Miklos said.  The ministry expects to save at least 435 million euros
($616 million) by freezing public-sector wages, cutting overhead
costs by 5 percent and other measures, Miklos said at a press
conference in Bratislava, Slovakia today to unveil a budget
framework for 2012. At the same time, a planned increase in
property and excise taxes, as well as the introduction of a bank
levy, will boost revenue.  The deficit target is based on expectations of the economy
growing 4.8 percent compared with a projected 3.4 percent this
year. The government will discuss the framework next month and
must submit the 2012 budget to parliament by October.  Slovakia, a euro-region member since 2009, wants to reduce
the budget shortfall below the European Union’s limit of 3
percent of GDP by 2013. The deficit ballooned to about 8 percent
in 2009 when the export-driven economy was hit by the global
economic crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
