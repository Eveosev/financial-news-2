Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending rate, opened at 0.15 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.13 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  will likely do tri-
party reverse repurchase agreements with the 32 money market
mutual funds it added in January as counterparties for these
transactions.  The New York Fed announced on March 23 that a series of
these temporary open-market operations would begin yesterday.
The actions, part of those first begun in December 2009, don’t
represent any change in monetary and are in preparation for the
Fed’s eventual withdrawal of its unprecedented monetary
stimulus.  The central bank will also acquire Treasury notes due from
September 2012 to September 2013 today as part of its plan to
purchase $600 billion more  U.S. debt  through June and reinvest
its maturing mortgage holdings. The Fed expects to reinvest $250
billion to $300 billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed debt
and agency securities into Treasuries during that time.  The central bank plans to purchase between $4 billion and
$6 billion securities today, according to the  Federal Reserve
Bank of New York ’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
