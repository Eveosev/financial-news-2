Wheat and corn rose in  Chicago ,
heading for a second week of gains, on concern grain stockpiles
may be too low to satisfy climbing demand.  World grain markets will face “continued tightness” next
season even as production may increase, the International Grains
Council said yesterday. Global cereal output will jump 4.6
percent to 1.805 billion metric tons in the year through June
2012, while consumption will advance 1.1 percent to 1.808
billion tons, it said.  “Carryover stocks could be quite tight, even as we’re
looking to have almost record plantings this year from the
States,” said Gary Mead, an analyst at VM Group in London.  Wheat for May delivery climbed 6 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$7.455 a bushel at 11:01 a.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices are up 3.1 percent this week. The grain fell
the most since August on March 15 on concern the prior week’s
earthquake in  Japan  might threaten demand.  “It’s remarkable how rapidly prices recovered after the
selloff after the Japanese earthquake,” Mead said. “I’m not
surprised, because the fundamentals for most of the grains are
very strong.”  Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 6 euros, or 2.6 percent, to 235.75 euros ($333.77) a
ton.  Chinese Purchase  China , the world’s biggest wheat consumer, bought 116,000
tons of the grain from the U.S. in the week ended March 17, the
largest such purchase since July 2005, Department of Agriculture
data showed yesterday. The amount was a “surprise,” said  Larry Glenn , an analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter,  Kansas .  Corn for May delivery added 7.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$7.10 a bushel in Chicago. The grain, up 3.9 percent this week,
touched $7.105, the highest price since March 9.  May-delivery soybeans rose 8.75 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$13.6325 a bushel. The oilseed was little changed for the week.  Food prices jumped to a record in February on rising
commodity costs, the  United Nations  said this month. Corn and
wheat may rise further as wet weather in the U.S. northern
Plains curbs production of the grains, VM’s Mead said.  The northern Plains states of  North Dakota ,  South Dakota 
and  Minnesota  are among the areas with an increased threat of
flooding in the next few weeks, according to the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Excess rain there may
trigger floods along the Red River of the North and the
Mississippi and Minnesota rivers.  “It will delay the planting, and that is likely to lower
yields, and farmers could run into early frost damage if we have
late harvesting,” Mead said. “This is still the early stages
of a bull market for corn and possibly for wheat.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
