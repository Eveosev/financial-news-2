Uganda ’s central bank took control
of Libyan-owned Tropical Bank Ltd. to protect it from United
Nations sanctions against the North African country, Bank of
Uganda Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile said.  The central bank sacked the board and managers appointed by
Libyan Arab Foreign Bank to ensure the lender is “fully
independent of the Libyan government,” Tumusiime-Mutebile said
in a statement handed to reporters today in the capital,
Kampala.  The UN imposed sanctions on  Libya  last month in an effort
to halt attacks by Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s regime on
protesters. Uganda’s government has frozen $375 million worth of
Libyan-owned assets to comply with the UN action, the Kampala-
based Daily Monitor newspaper reported today, citing the Foreign
Ministry.  The measures taken by the central bank were “to ensure that
Tropical Bank can continue to operate normally as a commercial
bank in Uganda,” Tumusiime-Mutebile said. “Tropical Bank is in a
sound financial condition and will continue with its normal
business operations.”  Board Chairman Gerald Sendaula will be retained at Tropical
Bank because he was appointed by the Ugandan government, while
Executive Director Kassim Nakibinge Kakungulu will take up the
position of managing director, Louis Kasekende, the central
bank’s deputy governor, told reporters in Kampala.  The Libyan Arab Foreign Bank owns 99.6875 percent of
Tropical Bank, with the Ugandan government controlling 0.3125
percent of the shares, according to the lender’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
