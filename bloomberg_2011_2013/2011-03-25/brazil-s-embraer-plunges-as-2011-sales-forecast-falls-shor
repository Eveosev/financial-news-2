Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker, fell the most in 17 months after its 2011
sales forecast missed analysts’ expectations.  The shares plunged 4.4 percent to 13.48 reais at 11:14 a.m.
New York time in Sao Paulo trading. Earlier, they declined 6.2
percent, the most on an intraday basis since October 2009. The
Bovespa index gained 1 percent to 68,191.26.  Embraer forecast net revenue of $5.6 billion in 2011, a 4.6
percent increase from 2010, according to a regulatory filing.
The “guidance implies limited growth and profitability
improvement,” said Caio Dias and Alexandre Amson, analysts at
Banco Santander SA, in a note to clients today.  The company also said it plans to will deliver 18 large
jets and 100 light jets this year, compared with Bank of America
Corp.’s estimate of 18 large jets and 145 light jets.  “The outlook is likely more conservative than many were
expecting,” a team of Bank of America analysts including Ronald Epstein wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
