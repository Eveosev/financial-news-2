Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , Canada’s third-
largest producer of the precious metal, is nearing completion of
a deal to buy the shares it doesn’t own in  Russia ’s Kupol mine,
according to a government official.  Kinross, which already owns 75 percent of Kupol developer
ZAO Chukotskaya Mining & Geological Co., will soon acquire the
rest, Igor Artemyev, head of Russia’s Anti-Monopoly Service,
told reporters today near Moscow, without putting a value on the
deal. Those shares are held by the Chukotka regional government,
according to Kinross’s  website .  The Toronto-based company got a controlling stake in
Siberia’s Kupol mine in 2007 when it bought Bema Gold Corp. for
C$4.27 billion ($4.37 billion).  Steve Mitchell, a spokesman for Kinross, wasn’t immediately
available for comment today. The company’s largest competitors
based in  Canada  are Barrick Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
