Jyoti Ltd. (JYTI) , an Indian engineering
company, expects orders worth 1.1 billion rupees ($25 million)
in the quarter ending June, a 61 percent increase from a year
ago, an executive said. Shares surged the most in three weeks.  “The government and private players are all setting up
plants, so I don’t see a slowdown in business,” Vice President
of Finance Ajay Kamdar said in an interview. Jyoti has an order
backlog of 10 billion rupees from companies including NTPC Ltd.,
 India ’s power producer, he said.  Sales at the Gujarat-based company may climb 32 percent to
3.85 billion rupees in the year ending March as an increase in
industrial production lifts demand for its products including
extraction pumps and switchgears used by utilities, chemical
makers and irrigation-equipment producers, said Kamdar. Revenue
may jump 33.5 percent to 1.6 billion rupees in the three months
ending March 31, he said.  The shares climbed as much as 6.9 percent to 92 rupees in
Mumbai before closing at 88.95 rupees, up 3.4 percent, the most
since March 4. The stock has shed 5.3 percent this year, less
than the 14 percent slump in the 552-member BSE Small-Cap Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
