Gold futures fell on bets that the
rally yesterday to a record was overdone. Silver also declined
as the dollar rose against a basket of major currencies and U.S.
equities gained.  “Gold made new highs, but it didn’t have any follow-
through,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC
in Chicago. “If you’re a trader bulled up in gold and it didn’t
launch, you have to sell.”  Yesterday, gold futures jumped to an all-time high of
$1,448.60 an ounce. The metal gained 0.7 percent this week after
turmoil in  Libya , radiation leaks from a damaged nuclear reactor
in Japan and Europe’s lingering debt crisis spurred demand for
an investment haven.  Gold futures for April delivery fell $8.70, or 0.6 percent,
to settle at $1,426.20 at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
The price has climbed 30 percent in the past 12 months.  Silver futures for May delivery dropped 32.6 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $37.049 an ounce. Yesterday, the price reached
$38.18, the highest in 31 years. The metal jumped 5.7 percent
this week and has more than doubled in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
