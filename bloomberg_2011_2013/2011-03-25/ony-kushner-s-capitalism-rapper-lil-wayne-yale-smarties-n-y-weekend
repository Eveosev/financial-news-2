Spend the evening with the
Marcantonios, as retired Italian longshoreman Gus fights with
his three grown kids about radicalism, unions and whether it’s
ever right to pay for sex.  Set in a Brooklyn brownstone, Tony Kushner’s “The
Intelligent Homosexual’s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with
a Key to the Scriptures” starts with Gus telling his family he
wants to kill himself and then spins into a freewheeling
dramatic odyssey.  Michael Cristofer, Linda Emond, Michael Esper and Stephen
Spinella reprise their roles from the Guthrie Theater world
premiere, and Michael Greif once more directs.  In previews at the  Public Theater , 425 Lafayette St.,
opening May 5. Information: +1-212-539-8500;

about the Russian painter: “Single and free.”  To explore his legacy, Gagosian is currently showing major
Malevich canvases surrounded by geometric works by such American
heavyweights as Judd,  Mark Rothko , Ellsworth Kelly, Dan Flavin
and Barnett Newman.  Take a look at Malevich’s purely abstract “Suprematism,
18th Construction,” and marvel that he painted it in 1915.  Through April 30 at Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Ave.
between 76th and 77th Sts. Information: +1-212-744-2313;

spiraling upward in circular pavilions at the Park Avenue
Armory.  Decorated with lightning bolts, mazes, flowery vines and
dazzling optical effects, all 650 are unique, displaying 300
years of craft creativity.  Curated by the American Folk Art Museum, the exhibited
quilts are part of Joanna Rose’s great collection.  “Infinite Variety: Three Centuries of Red and White
Quilts” runs through March 30 at 643 Park Ave between 66th and
67th Sts. Information: +1-212-265-1040;

couch. It takes awhile to notice the shadowy men staring
intently at her.  This is Sebastiaan Bremer’s 2011 hand-painted chromogenic
print “Susanna Surprised by the Elders.”  Bremer enlarges photographs and then applies dots of paint
to the surface, giving the images a hallucinatory quality. In
“Leda and the Swan,” an ethereal bird embraces a woman’s
curves from behind.  “Nudes and Revolutions” runs through April 23 at Edwynn
Houk Gallery, 745 Fifth Ave. at 57th St. Information: +1-212-
750-7070;  http://www.houkgallery.com .  Saturday  For some smart talk, head to Le Poisson Rouge to join the
 Writers Studio  celebration of the  Yale Review ’s 100th
anniversary.  The Review actually started in 1819, but didn’t become a
literary journal until nearly 100 years later. Now it’s the
nation’s oldest.  Early on, a critic noted its “freedom from cant, from
pedantry, and from vaporous theorizing,” despite its “many
articles by university professors.”  Lorrie Moore, Edmund White, Caryl Phillips and Louise Gluck
will be on hand to read, along with some surprise guests. Editor
and poet J.D. McClatchy introduces the proceedings.  At 6:30. 158 Bleecker St. Information: +1-212-505-3474;

Jamison Connelly, a foul-mouthed, recovering alcoholic nun who
saves souls in a rehab center.  Newcomer Evan Jonigkeit plays Cody, a 19-year old meth
addict who has no real interest in recovery. Stephen Kunken is
the priest who put them together.  In writing “High,” Matthew Lombardo tapped into his own
struggles with crystal meth.  In previews at the Booth Theater, 222 W. 45th St., opening
April 19. Information: +1-212-239-6200;

“Hell” looks at post-war Berlin.  Kokoschka, Kandinsky, Nolde, they’re all here: The exhibit
has 250 works by 30 artists focused on urban angst, sex,
violence, decadence and the faint hope of redemption.  “German Expressionism: The Graphic Impulse” runs through

Sunday in the company of bubblegum-bruiser Nicki Minaj and
Teflon Don Rick Ross.  Wayne will no doubt supply his usual frenetic blast of
rhymes and beats, while Nicki will pull her best monster faces.  Your night can only be enhanced by a healthy supply of
purple drank.  1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, NY. Information: +1-
