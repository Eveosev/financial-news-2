Ukraine recorded a current-account
deficit in February after a surplus in January as the former
Soviet state increased imports of Russian natural gas.  The shortfall totaled $1.135 billion last month, the Kiev-
based Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy said today in a statement on its
 website . The central bank revised the January surplus to $319
million from $282 million.  The country had an $816 million current-account gap for the
first two months of the year, compared with a surplus of $304
million in the same period a year ago, the bank said.  Imports surged 63.1 percent in January-February as gas
purchases more than doubled to 3.3 billion cubic meters, the
bank said. Exports rose 46.2 percent, driven by metals and
chemicals, according to the statement.  Foreign direct investment totaled $509 million in the first
two months, compared with $465 million in the same period a year
ago, the bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
