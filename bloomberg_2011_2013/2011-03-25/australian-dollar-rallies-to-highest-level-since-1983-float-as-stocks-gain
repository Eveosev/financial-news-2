The Australian dollar advanced to
its highest level since it began trading freely in 1983 as a
gain in global stocks boosted demand for assets related to
economic growth.  The Aussie had its biggest weekly rally since July against
its U.S. counterpart on eased concern  Japan ’s nuclear crisis
following its worst earthquake on record will slow global
economic growth. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index, known as the VIX, dropped for a seventh day in its
longest stretch of decreases since July.  “There’s low volatility, a stable VIX index and equities
are doing well, so you have to be long on the highest-yielding
currency you can find,” said  Tony Allen , global head of
foreign-exchange trading at  Australia  & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. in Sydney. A long position is a bet an asset will
gain in value.  Australia’s dollar appreciated 0.7 percent to $1.0288 at
12:12 p.m. in  New York , from $1.0212 yesterday, after touching
the record high of $1.0294. The Aussie rallied 3.3 percent this
week in its biggest five-day advance since July 9.  New Zealand ’s
dollar gained 1 percent to 75.66 U.S. cents.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent. The VIX fell
to 17.22 after touching 29.40 on March 16, the highest level on
a closing basis since July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
