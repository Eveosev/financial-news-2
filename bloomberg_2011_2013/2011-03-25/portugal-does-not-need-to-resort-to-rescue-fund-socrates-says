Portuguese Prime Minister  Jose
Socrates  said his country does not need to resort to a rescue
fund and has conditions to finance itself in the market.  “The idea that  Europe  would be better defended if Portugal
requested external aid is a childish idea,” Socrates told
reporters in Brussels today. “Because everyone knows that in
the first place that would be damaging to Europe, damaging to
the prestige of Europe with the weakening of the single
currency. And worse than that, if Portugal were to fall that
would mean that other countries and other situations would be
exposed with more risk.”  “That would mean supporting the domino theory, in which
one goes after the other,” the prime minister said. “This has
to stop, and it will stop here.  Portugal  does not need any
rescue fund, Portugal does not need external help, and Portugal
will defend itself.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
