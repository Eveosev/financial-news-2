Spanish police said they arrested a
foreign-exchange operator suspected of running a $300 million
Ponzi-type fraud that may have affected at least 100,000
investors in  Europe , the U.S. and Latin America.  The "mini-Madoff," dubbed in reference to jailed Ponzi con
man Bernard L. Madoff, offered returns of as much as 10 percent
to 20 percent monthly for investments in foreign currencies and
instead used the money to buy real estate for himself and
colleagues, according to a National Police statement today.  The man, German Cardona Soler, is 49 years old and a
Spanish citizen, said a police spokeswoman who declined to be
named, following agency policy. He was arrested in the
Mediterranean city of  Valencia . Two more people were apprehended
and seven people were accused in relation to the suspected
fraud, the statement said.  Accounts in 12 banks have been blocked and the titles
frozen for more than 20 properties in  Spain , the police said.  In Ponzi schemes, money from new customers is typically
used to pay phony "returns" to earlier investors, giving the
pretense that actual investments have taken place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
