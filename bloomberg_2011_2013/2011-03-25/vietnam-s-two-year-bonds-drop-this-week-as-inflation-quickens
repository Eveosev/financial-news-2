Vietnamese two-year  government
bonds  slid for a fifth straight week as inflation quickened to a
25-month high in March. The dong gained today.  Prices rose 13.89 percent from a year earlier, the most
since February 2009, the General Statistics Office said
yesterday.  The yield on two-year bonds rose eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 11.50 percent this week, according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
dropped five basis points today.  The State Treasury failed to sell 2 trillion dong ($96
million) of five- and 10-year bonds yesterday, the Hanoi Stock
Exchange said in a statement on its website. Investors sought
rates from 11.95 percent to 12.50 percent on the five-year
notes, while the ceiling rate was 11.80 percent, according to
the statement posted late yesterday.  The dong rose 0.1 percent today to 20,875 per dollar as of
2:50 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency was little changed from a week ago.  The central bank set the dong’s reference rate at 20,683,
compared with 20,688 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
