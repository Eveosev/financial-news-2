Telenor ASA (TEL) , the Nordic region’s
largest phone company, said that a court in  India  has blocked a
rights issue aimed at helping its unit there expand.  The company is asking an Indian court to lift the stay so
that a rights issue authorized by the board of Indian unit
Uninor can proceed, Glenn Mandelid, a spokesman for Fornebu,
Norway-based Telenor, said by e-mail.  Telenor owns 67.25 percent of  Uninor , and Indian real
estate company  Unitech Ltd. (UT)  owns the remainder. Uninor, which
opened to customers in December 2009, had an operating loss of
5.04 billion kroner ($903 million) on sales of 773 million
kroner last year as it struggled to build a loyal customer base
in the crowded Indian mobile market. Unitech opposes the rights
issue, it said in a separate statement by e-mail.  “Unitech has obtained a stay order on certain actions,
which Telenor was proposing to take and which Unitech believes
are not in the best interests of the shareholders,” Unitech
said, according to the statement.  A hearing on Telenor’s petition will be held tomorrow at
the Gurgaon District Court, Telenor’s Mandelid said in a text
message. Telenor didn’t immediately respond to requests for
further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
