Saab Automobile Chief Executive
Officer Jan-Aake Jonsson, who has led the unprofitable Swedish
automaker for six years, will retire in May.  Dutch owner  Spyker Cars NV (SPYKR)  has started a search for a
successor, the company said today in a statement. Jonsson, who
turns 60 this year, took over Trollhaettan, Sweden-based Saab in
April 2005, when it was a unit of  General Motors Co. (GM)   “The last three years were very intense, I spent almost all
my time focusing on work,” Jonsson told reporters on a
conference call today. “It’s put a lot of strain on myself as
an individual. We all get older and get new perspectives and
priorities.”  Jonsson led Saab through the financial crisis at a time
when it was on the brink of bankruptcy, before GM sold the
company to Spyker in February 2010. The executive, who’s worked
for Saab for almost 40 years, said he has “no immediate
plans.”  “He was a very experienced manager,” Martin Crum, an
analyst at Amsterdams Effectenkantoor BV, said by phone. Finding
a replacement for Jonsson will be difficult, Crum said. The
resignation is “absolutely a negative.”  Spyker, which today reported a full-year loss before
interest and taxes of 140 million euros ($198 million), said
Jonsson will leave Saab on May 19 after the parent company’s
shareholder meeting. Victor Muller, Spyker’s CEO and chairman of
Saab, will take over as the Swedish company’s chief executive
until a successor is named.  Industry Candidates  Replacement candidates “are definitely from the
industry,” Muller told reporters. “It would take too long for
someone who’s not from the industry to understand how it really
works in a car company, let alone Saab.”  Spyker dropped as much as 35 cents, or 7 percent, to 4.65
euros and was down 4.5 percent, to 4.78 euros, at 11:02 a.m. in
Amsterdam. The shares have gained 38 percent this year, valuing
the carmaker at 96.1 million euros.  Saab sold 31,696 cars last year, up 15 percent from 2009.
Its best year was 2006, when it delivered 133,000 vehicles. The
company aims to sell 120,000 cars and become profitable by next
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
