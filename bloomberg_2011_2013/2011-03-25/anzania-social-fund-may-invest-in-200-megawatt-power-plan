Tanzania’s state-run  National
Social Security Fund  may invest in a 200-megawatt power plant in
the region of Mkuranga, to the south of Dar es Salaam, the
commercial capital.  “We plan to construct the gas-fired power plant and later
sell it,” John Msemo, projects manager at the fund, said in an
interview yesterday from Dar es Salaam.  The fund is investing in generating electricity for the
first time, prompted by a 260-megawatt deficit in East Africa’s
second biggest economy. Msemo said the size of the investment
would be determined after feasibility studies are complete. He
didn’t say whether the fund would seek a partner.  In January 2007, Paris-based Etablissements Maurel et Prom
SA found a flow of 19.2 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas in Mkuranga, according to information on its website.  The Social Security Fund may also invest in developing two
power plants fired by both gas and heavy  fuel oil  at Kinyerezi
in  Dar es Salaam  and Somanga Funga, about 200 kilometers (124
miles) from the city, Msemo said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
