Natural gas futures rose to the
highest level in more than seven weeks as forecasts showed
colder-than-normal weather, boosting demand for the heating
fuel.  Gas gained for a third week as the  Climate Prediction
Center  forecast cooler-than-usual weather for the eastern U.S.
from March 30 to April 7. The low temperature in New York will
be 26 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3 Celsius) tomorrow, 12 degrees
below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
 Pennsylvania .  “You have cold weather along the East Coast next week and
traders are not willing to go short over the weekend,” said
 Hamza Khan , an analyst with the Schork Group Inc., a consulting
company in Villanova, Pennsylvania.  Natural gas for April delivery advanced 15.9 cents, or 3.8
percent, to $4.403 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement level since
Feb. 2. The futures increased 5.6 percent this week. The April
contract expires on March 29.  Gas gains accelerated in the last 30 minutes of trading,
with prices rising from below $4.30 to above $4.40.  “Apparently some traders decided to go long in the last
few minutes since it’s going to be cold next week,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics, an energy research
firm in  London ,  Arkansas . “Some traders are probably also
buying contracts to cover their short positions before the
contract expires.”  April Storms  A series of storms stretching into April is making it
harder for computer forecasting models to determine how cold the
U.S. East will be,  Matt Rogers , president of  Commodity Weather
Group LLC , said in a note to clients today.  CWG’s forecast from March 30 to April 3 says it’s likely
that an area of below-normal temperatures will develop in the
Northeast and the Ohio Valley and back into Illinois and
Missouri.  U.S. heating demand will be 19 percent higher than average
from tomorrow through April 1, according to Weather Derivatives
in Belton,  Missouri .  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas also gained as data showed the  U.S. economy  is
improving, according to Williams.  Economic Growth  Gross domestic product grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in
the fourth quarter, comparing with a 2.8 percent estimate issued
last month, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
 Washington .  The number of gas drilling rigs rose this week after
dropping to the lowest level since Jan. 29, 2010 in the previous
week.  The rig count increased 5 to 880, Houston-based Baker
Hughes Inc. reported today.  U.S. gas inventories slipped 6 billion cubic feet in the
week ended March 18 to 1.612 trillion cubic feet, the Energy
Department reported yesterday.  The stockpile decrease was smaller than the five-year
average withdrawal for the week of 17 billion cubic feet,
department data show. A surplus to the five-year average rose to
2.2 percent from 1.4 percent the previous week.  U.S. gas production advanced 1.1 percent in December from
November, according to the Energy Department’s monthly  EIA-914
report . Output in the lower 48 states increased for a second
month, increasing 0.2 percent to 66.76 billion cubic feet a day
from a revised 66.6 billion.  The department will release a new EIA-914 report on March
29, covering January production levels.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
259,726 as of 2:56 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 307,000. Volume was 408,591 yesterday. Open interest was
887,596 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
878,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
