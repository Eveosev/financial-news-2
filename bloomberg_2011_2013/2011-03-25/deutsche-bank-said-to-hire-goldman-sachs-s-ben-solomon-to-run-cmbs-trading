Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  hired Ben Solomon
from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to run commercial-mortgage backed
securities trading.  Solomon, who traded derivatives tied to commercial real
estate loans at New York-based Goldman Sachs, will run secondary
commercial-mortgage backed bond trading at Deutsche Bank,
according to a person familiar with the move.  Renee Calabro  a
Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, confirmed the hire.  The Frankfurt-based lender is bulking up in trading
commercial-mortgage-backed securities as banks have issued about
$8 billion of the debt this year, compared with $11.5 billion in
all of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche
Bank and UBS AG sold $2.2 billion of the securities last month
in the largest offering since 2007 before the market seized up
amid the financial crisis.  Solomon declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
