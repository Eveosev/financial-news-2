Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  will move cautiously with
any customization of Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 operating
system, the magazine Network World reported on its website,
citing executive vice president Kai Oeistaemoe.  “Even if we have the right to change it, it would be unwise
to change it in ways that cause problems,” Oeistaemoe said
according to Network World. Nokia will look to integrate its
maps and camera functions with Windows Phone 7, improving the
repertoire of the system for other developers as well, Network
World said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
