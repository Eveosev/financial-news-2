  BG Group Plc , Premier Oil Plc and
Cove Energy Plc, the U.K. explorers, plan to secure exploration
permits for two blocks off Kenya, according to  Pancontinental
Oil & Gas NL , the group’s Australian partner.  The Kenyan government offered the companies new licenses
for offshore blocks 10A and 10B, Pancontinental said yesterday
in a statement.  “East Africa is becoming an increasingly prospective area
with major gas discoveries to the south in Tanzania and
Mozambique,” Richard Rose, an analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd.
in London, said in an e-mailed note.  Oil explorers have been attracted by the deepwater finds by
BG and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. East Africa holds more than 31
billion barrels of oil, according to U.K. explorer  Afren Plc ,
three times as much as Brazil’s  Tupi field , the biggest
discovery in the Americas in 30 years.  Malcolm Brown, senior vice president for exploration at BG,
on Feb. 21 declined to comment on plans in Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
