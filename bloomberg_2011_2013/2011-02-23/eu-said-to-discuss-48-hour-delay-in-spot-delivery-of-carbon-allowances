The European Union regulator will
discuss introducing a 48-hour delay on delivery of spot carbon
allowances to help protect the worldâ€™s biggest emissions market
from crime, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  The mechanism will provide extra time for the transfer of
permits between user accounts in the registries that track
ownership of the allowances, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the consultations are private.  The commission will discuss the trading delay at a meeting
with member states in Brussels today, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
