  Egypt ’s interim government is
considering how it can improve the lives of the country’s
poorest citizens to make sure they benefit from economic growth,
said Gouda Abdel Khaleq, solidarity and social justice minister.  Officials are studying proposals that address wages, taxes
and a national employment program, Abdel Khaleq told reporters
in Cairo today without giving details.  “It’s time for the poor to get their rights from the
output of this society,” he said.  Abdel Khaleq, nine other ministers and a new deputy prime
minister were sworn in yesterday. The new Cabinet lineup follows
the Feb. 11 toppling of President  Hosni Mubarak  after anti-
government protests. Mubarak ceded power to the military, which
suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament, saying it
will rule for six months or until elections are held.  To contact the reporters on this story:
