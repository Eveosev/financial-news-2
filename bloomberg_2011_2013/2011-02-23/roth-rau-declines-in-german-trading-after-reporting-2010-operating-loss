Roth & Rau AG fell as much as 8.3
percent in Frankfurt trading, the most since December, after the
German maker of solar-cell production equipment reported an
operating loss for 2010, owing largely to one-time costs.  The company, based in Hohenstein, said today in a  filing 
that 42.9 million euros ($58.9 million) of “special items” at
the operating level led to a 25.9 million-euro loss in earnings
before interest and tax. Ebit before special items was a gain of
17 million euros. A year ago Ebit was 16.1 million euros.  The stock dropped as low as 14.14 euros in electronic
trading and was at 14.15 euros, down 8.2 percent, as of 4:16
p.m. local time.  The one-time costs relate to risks and impairment loses
related to projects and customers, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
