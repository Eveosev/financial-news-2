  Colombia ’s peso fell for a third day
amid concern escalating violence in Libya will further boost the
price of oil, slowing global economic growth.  The peso slid 0.2 percent to 1,898.45 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,895.15 yesterday. It has lost 1.1 percent in the past three
days, paring its gain this year to 0.5 percent.  Oil rose to the highest level in more than two years today
as Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  vowed to keep fighting the
rebellion in the country,  Africa ’s third-biggest oil supplier.
The spread of political turmoil to Libya will add
“stagflationary winds” to the global economy, Mohamed El- Erian, chief executive officer at Pacific Investment Management
Co., said in an interview yesterday.  “The risk-off move is dominating,”  Paul Biszko , an
emerging-market strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto,
said in a telephone interview. “The higher oil price is a
double sword for Colombia. Exports benefit from better terms of
trade, and on the other hand, it exacerbates inflation.”  Crude accounts for about 40 percent of Colombia’s exports
and coal makes up 15 percent. Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent
in January from a year earlier, the fastest pace since June
2009.  The yield on benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.35 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The price fell 0.15
centavo to 116.704 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
