The price of natural gas for next-
day delivery in the U.S. Northeast slipped for the first time in
three days on forecasts of moderating temperatures that may
reduce demand for the heating fuel.  Temperatures may be normal across much of the mid-Atlantic
tomorrow, according to Frontier Weather Inc. in Tulsa,  Oklahoma .
Temperatures were below-normal throughout the Northeast today.  Wholesale natural gas for next-day delivery at the Transco-
Z6 hub, which transports the fuel to the New York City area,
tumbled $3.0398, or 27 percent, to $8.2862 per million British
thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Gas at the
Tetco-M3 hub, which also transports gas to New York, fell 81.67
cents, or 16 percent, to $4.1955.  Gas for next-day delivery at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, dropped 6.5 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.8289. The
hub is the benchmark for gas futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Scheduled deliveries to homes in the U.S. and Canada
declined 4.6 percent to 37.6 million dekatherms (36.5 billion
cubic feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 2:20
p.m. in  New York . That was the lowest level since Nov. 30.  Residences in New York were to receive 3.7 million
dekatherms of gas, 4.1 percent fewer than yesterday, Bloomberg
data show. The decline was the first in six days.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants were to be down
0.4 percent to 11.1 million dekatherms.  The low temperature early today in New York was 21 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 6 Celsius), the National Weather Service
reported. The normal is 30, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. The low tomorrow will be 39
degrees, 9 above normal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
