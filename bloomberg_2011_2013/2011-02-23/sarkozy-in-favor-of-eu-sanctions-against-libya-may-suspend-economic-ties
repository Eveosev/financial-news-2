French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
wants the European Union to consider imposing sanctions against
Libya, a statement from his office said.  Sarkozy may suspend France’s economic and commercial
relations with the North African country, the statement said.  Sarkozy said he’s asking “our European partners to rapidly
adopt concrete sanctions so that those who are implicated in the
violence know that they must bear the consequences of their
actions,” the statement said. “These measures should include
the possibility of making people face justice, blocking access
to the European Union, and the surveillance of financial
movements.”  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has vowed to fight a growing
rebellion until his “last drop of blood,” as army units
defected and a former aide said his regime may crumble within
days.  Human Rights Watch  says 300 people have already died in
the violence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
