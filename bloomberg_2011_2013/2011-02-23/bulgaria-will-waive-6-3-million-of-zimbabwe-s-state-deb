  Bulgaria ’s Cabinet decided to waive
$6.3 million, or 77 percent, of Soviet-era Zimbabwean debt and
transform it into development aid.  According to a draft agreement between the two countries to
be signed later this year,  Zimbabwe  would repay $1.886 million
in four instalments, the Sofia-based government said in an e-
mail today, after approving the draft.  Zimbabwe’s $8.2 million debt, not serviced in the past 20
years, was accumulated before the collapse of the communist
regime in Bulgaria in 1990, in return for arms, construction of
roads and factories and technical aid. The southern African
nation’s total external debt was $6.9 billion at the end of last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
