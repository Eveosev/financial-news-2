  Telekom Austria AG , the country’s
biggest phone operator, reported an unexpected fourth-quarter
loss as spending rose for changing the company’s business
structure and shedding employees.  The net loss was 61.1 million euros ($83.8 million)
compared with net income of 63.6 million euro a year earlier,
the Vienna-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
were expecting net income of 25.3 million, according to the
average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The former Austrian phone monopoly, which runs mobile
networks in seven eastern European countries, reported a 98
million-euro one-time reorganization cost in the quarter. The
company has been offering severance packages to encourage
workers to leave, along with combining business units to cut
long-term costs.  Telekom  Austria  reiterated that 2011 earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization will total as much
as 1.6 billion euros. The company is targeting sales of up to
4.6 billion euros.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
