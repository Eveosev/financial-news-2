A bill pulling  New Hampshire  out of
the U.S. Northeast carbon cap-and-trade program advanced in the
Republican-led state House.  The House of Representatives voted 240-108 for a bill that
would remove New Hampshire from the 10-state Regional Greenhouse
Gas Initiative at the end of this year, according to the
legislature’s website.  The bill passed the House Committee on Science Technology
and Energy on Feb. 15. Today’s vote sent the bill to the House
Finance Committee. It must be brought back for a House vote
before being sent to the state Senate.  Governor  John Lynch , a Democrat, said Feb. 10 he’ll oppose
the Republican effort to pull the state out of the regional
program, which regulates carbon dioxide from power-plant
smokestacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
