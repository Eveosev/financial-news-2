European Central Bank Governing
Council member Mario Draghi’s career at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc .
is a problem for European Union governments as they seek to find
a successor for ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet ,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing an unidentified French official.  Draghi was at the core of the U.S. financial system, whose
“excesses” went far beyond the imaginable, the newspaper said,
citing the official. France hasn’t determined which candidate to
back as a decision won’t come before June, the Duesseldorf-based
newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
