  Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd .,
South Africa’s second-largest construction company, had a loss
in the six months through December after it took charges because
it may not be fully paid on three large public-sector projects.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Bruce, 61, and Financial
Director Roger Rees, listed as 57 in the latest annual report,
will both retire by the end of June after 11 years in their
posts, the company said. A new CEO will be named before then,
Murray & Robert said in a statement today.  The net loss was 636 million rand ($89 million), compared
with a profit of 576 million rand a year earlier, the company
said in the statement. Sales rose 2.5 percent to 15.8 billion
rand.  Payment delays on a rapid-rail project and a power station
in  South Africa  as well as a terminal at Dubai airport forced
Murray & Roberts to take impairment charges of 410 million rand
on “contracts in progress” and a charge of 385 million rand
for “expenses against which revenue recovery is not certain,”
the company said.  There is 1.25 billion rand in “uncertified revenue,” said
Murray & Roberts, which is based near Johannesburg. The company
said it’s pursuing “complex claims on major projects” through
arbitration and is unable to “confidently quantify” any
recoveries.  Murray & Roberts shares fell 2.1 percent to 27.41 rand at
the 3 p.m. close of trading in Johannesburg, after trading
little changed before the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
