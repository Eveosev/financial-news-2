The yield on  India ’s 11-year bond
held near a six-week low on speculation demand for debt in the
secondary market is increasing due to the absence of new
offerings for at least the next month.  The  finance ministry  has sold 4.27 trillion rupees ($94.4
billion) of fixed-income securities since April, completing its
borrowing program for the fiscal year ending March 31, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks and fund managers are
adding to their holdings from the secondary market due to the
lack of new offerings, said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader
at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  “The positive is there are no supplies scheduled for at
least a month more,” Verma said. “That is spurring some
buying.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022, the
most-traded government debt, rose two basis points to 8.11
percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. It touched 8.08 percent yesterday, the
lowest since Jan. 5.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
was little changed at 7.48 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
