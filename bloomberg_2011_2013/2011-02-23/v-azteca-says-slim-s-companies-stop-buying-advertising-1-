TV Azteca SAB,  Mexico ’s second-
largest broadcaster, said billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s companies
have stopped buying advertising, days after bigger rival Grupo
Televisa SA disclosed Slim was no longer a client.  A TV Azteca official who can’t be named under company
policy confirmed a report on the decision by Slim’s companies by
Mexico City newspaper El Universal. The official said the
company isn’t providing further details.  America Movil SAB, Telefonos de Mexico SAB and Grupo Carso
SAB, all controlled by Slim, are forgoing advertising on the two
TV chains, which capture almost all of Mexico’s broadcast
audience.  Arturo Elias , a spokesman for Slim, said last week
that the investor’s companies walked away from Televisa because
of a price increase.  Elias didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-mail
messages today.  TV Azteca is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results
tomorrow. The Mexico City-based company is controlled by  Ricardo Salinas , who according to Forbes magazine is Mexico’s second-
richest man, after Slim.  TV Azteca gained 2 centavos to 8.42 pesos in Mexico City
trading. The shares have declined 2.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
