Executive Officer William Nazaret after reporting its fourth
straight quarterly loss.  Salvador Alvarez, former CEO of medical services company
Aplicaciones Medicales Integrales SA, will take over for Nazaret,
Maxcom said today in a statement. Nazaret, who led Maxcom for
two years, will be an external adviser for a transition period

service to lure customers from larger rival Telefonos de Mexico

earlier to almost 238,000, business lines dropped 16 percent to
more than 65,000.  Maxcom’s fourth-quarter loss of 949 million pesos ($77
million) compared with income of 23 million pesos a year earlier,
the company said today in a filing to Mexico’s stock exchange.

million-peso estimate of analyst Karla Beatriz Pena of Corp.
Actinver SAB in Mexico City.  Maxcom fell 4 centavos to 6.35 pesos today before the CEO
change and fourth-quarter results were announced. The shares
