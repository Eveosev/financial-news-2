  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Property Index,
which contains seven of the city’s largest developers, reversed
losses after Financial Secretary John Tsang said today measures
to prevent the formation of asset bubbles were working.  Tsang made the statement in an address on the city’s budget,
in which he also said Hong Kong’s economy has fully recovered
from the global financial crisis.  “The budget speech didn’t include harsh measures to curb
the property prices so the market welcomed it,” said  Yoji Takeda , who helps manage $1.1 billion in Hong Kong at RBC
Investment Management   Asia ) Ltd. “Markets were concerned there
could be further measures to control the property prices, but
nothing concrete came out. The increased land supply was
expected already.”  The index, which earlier fell as much as 0.9 percent,
climbed 0.5 percent to 28,205.84 at the midday-trading break.    Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd ., the world’s largest developer
by market value, advanced 1.1 percent to HK$123.10 after
dropping as much as 1 percent before Tsang began presenting his
annual budget speech to legislators. Sino Land Co., a Hong Kong
developer controlled by billionaire Robert Ng, increased 2.6
percent to HK$14.14. New World Development Ltd., which gets more
than half of its revenue from Hong Kong, increased 1.9 percent
to HK$13.98.  To contact the reporters on this story:
