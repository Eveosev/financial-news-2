Following is a list of  oil companies 
active in  Libya  with information as to whether they have reduced
production because of current violent protests in  Africa ’s third
largest crude producer.  The output figures are for crude in barrels a day and are
the latest estimate of pre-crisis production unless a timeframe
is given in brackets. Libya produced 1.59 million barrels of
crude a day in January, according to Bloomberg estimates.  All figures except those for  BASF SE ’s Wintershall refer to
each company’s share of production where fields are jointly
owned with partners. Wintershall couldn’t be reached today to
clarify this when Bloomberg News called its press office in
Kassel,  Germany  three times today.
