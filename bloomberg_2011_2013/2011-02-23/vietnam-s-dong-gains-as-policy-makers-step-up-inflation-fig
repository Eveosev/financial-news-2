  Vietnam ’s dong rose after the
central bank increased its reverse repurchase rate, boosting
borrowing costs for the second time in a week to help curb the
fastest inflation in two years.  The State Bank of Vietnam raised the rate it charges
commercial banks in open-market operations to 12 percent from 11
percent for the seven-day term yesterday, Deputy Governor Nguyen
Toan Thang said by telephone in Hanoi. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dung will sign a resolution today directing the central bank and
ministries to tighten monetary and fiscal policy, and lower the
credit-growth target to about 20 percent from 23 percent, Le
Xuan Nghia, an adviser to the premier, said yesterday.  The dong gained 0.2 percent to 20,835 per dollar as of 3:13
p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set the daily  reference
rate  at 20,683, compared with 20,678 yesterday, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  “Investors are expecting dong  interest rates  will climb as
the government’s priority now is containing inflation, which is
reflected in their moves to raise the rate at open-market
operations and cut the credit-growth target,” said Lai Tat Ha,
head of  currency trading  at Hanoi-based Vietnam Technological &
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank. “Therefore, people may consider
buying less gold and foreign currency.”  The dong traded between 22,070 and 22,150 per dollar at
money changers in  Ho Chi Minh City , compared with between 22,000
and 22,130 yesterday, according to an information service run by
state-owned Vietnam Posts & Telecommunications.  The yield on the benchmark five-year bonds was unchanged at
11.54 percent, according to a daily fixing price from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  Consumer prices rose 12.31 percent from a year earlier this
month, following a 12.17 percent increase in January, according
to figures released by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi
today. That’s the biggest advance since February 2009. Prices
increased 2.09 percent from last month.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
