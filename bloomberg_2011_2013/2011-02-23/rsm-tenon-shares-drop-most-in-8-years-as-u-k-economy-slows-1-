  RSM Tenon Group Plc , a U.K. adviser
to about 10,000 businesses, fell the most in eight years after
saying income may be crimped by a slowing economy and rising
inflation.  The shares slumped 11.25 pence, or 21 percent, to 42 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London trading, the biggest loss since
February 2003, giving the company a market value of 135.4
million pounds ($220 million).  “There is a high degree of uncertainty in the U.K.
market,” Andy Raynor, chief executive officer said by phone
today. “We have to maintain a shifting emphasis in our business
to find the most appropriate levels of profitability. Our
objective is to pursue organic growth.”  The U.K. government’s biggest spending cuts since World War
II, insolvency statistics and inflation, which have affected
RSM’s business in the first half, will continue this year, the
company said in a statement today.  “This results in a more uncertain trading environment and
whilst we fully expect underlying profitability to continue to
progress, we consider that it will be at a slower pace than
originally anticipated,” RSM said in the statement.  Profit from continuing operations rose to 1.31 million
pounds, or 0.4 pence a share, in the six months through December
from 1.22 million pounds, or 0.61 pence a share, a year earlier,
the London-based company said in a statement today. Sales rose
65 percent to 121.1 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
