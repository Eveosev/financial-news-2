A former member of  Zimbabwe ’s
Parliament and 45 other people were charged with treason after
police raided a meeting they held to express solidarity with
protesters in Egypt and  Tunisia , the lawmaker’s lawyer said.  Munyaradzi Gwisai and the other members of Zimbabwe’s
International Socialist Organization were arraigned in a court
in Harare, the capital, today, said Alec Muchadehama, his
lawyer. They will appear again tomorrow, he said by phone.  The Feb. 19 meeting was held to draw lessons for Zimbabwe
from the popular uprisings in the North African countries that
saw their presidents leave power, said James Sabau, a police
spokesman, in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
