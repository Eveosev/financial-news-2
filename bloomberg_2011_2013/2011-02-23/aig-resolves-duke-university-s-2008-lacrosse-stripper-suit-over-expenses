  American International Group Inc . has
resolved a lawsuit filed by  Duke University  over expenses tied
to the school’s dispute with lacrosse team members falsely
accused of sexually assaulting a stripper.  The university and the unit of New York-based AIG that sold
insurance coverage to Duke “agree to the dismissal” of the
claims, according to a joint filing yesterday in U.S. District
Court in Durham,  North Carolina . The court document didn’t
disclose terms of the settlement.  The school was seeking reimbursement of costs from
confidential settlements with three members of the team who were
exonerated after they were accused of rape by a woman invited to
a 2006 party. AIG, the bailed-out life and property-casualty
insurer, had offered $5 million to Duke, Joseph O’Neil, a lawyer
for the insurer, said in December 2008.  Duke had demanded reimbursement for costs tied to lawsuits
by players and another by the team’s former coach over the
school’s role in investigating the accusation, according to the
November 2008 complaint. The athletes said Duke remained silent
during the probe even though the university had evidence they
were innocent.  Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, and Gregg McDougal, a
lawyer for Duke at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP, declined
to comment.  The case is Duke University and  Duke University  Health
System Inc. v. National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh
Pa., 08-cv-0854, U.S. District Court, Middle District of North
Carolina (Durham).  To contact the reporter on this story:
