  Argentina ’s trade surplus fell 58
percent in January to $513 million from the same month a year
earlier as imports rose more than twice as fast as exports.  The surplus fell from $1.2 billion in January last year,
the national statistics institute said reported today. Exports
rose 22 percent to $5.4 billion, while imports rose 52 percent
to $4.9 billion in the same period, the agency said in Buenos
Aires today. Economists expected a $412 million surplus,
according to the median six estimates in Bloomberg survey.  President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government last
week imposed limits on some overseas goods by requiring
importers to obtain special permits for those products and
materials, a policy Economy Minister Amado Boudou today said
sought to protect local industries. The 2010 surplus shrank to
$12.1 billion from $16.9 billion in 2009.  “Since 2003, we’ve been using policies that tend to
preserve Argentines jobs -- a program to substitute imports and
to boost exports,” Boudou said in an interview with Radio La
Red in  Buenos Aires . “This path has been good to have more jobs
and to ensure that the economy expands every year.”  The jump in imports was led by an increase in purchases of
chemicals, parts and accessories, laptops and liquefied natural
gas, the agency reported.  The combination of accelerating inflation and the peso’s
4.5 percent decline against the dollar, which was the worst-
performance in 2010 among seven major Latin American currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, is hurting the country’s competitiveness,
said Camilo Tiscornia, a former economist at the central bank
who now runs Buenos Aires-based research company C&T Asesores
Economicos.  “We are in a situation where on the one hand you have a
government that doesn’t want to let the peso move because that
makes people calm, and on the other hand is losing
competitiveness with an inflation rate of 25 percent to 30
percent,” Tiscornia said.  The peso, which has weakened 1.3 percent this year, was
little changed today at 4.0296 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
