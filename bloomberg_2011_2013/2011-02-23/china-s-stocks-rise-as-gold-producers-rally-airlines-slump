  China ’s stocks rebounded from the
biggest loss in a month, as investors sought gold producers as a
hedge against inflation and after violence escalated in Libya.  Zijin Mining Group Co., the biggest gold producer, surged
the most in four months after bullion traded within 3 percent of
a record. A gauge tracking health-care companies gained the most
among 10 industry groups in the  CSI 300 Index  on speculation
they will be more sheltered from tightening measures and Middle
East tensions.  Air China Ltd . paced declines for airlines as oil
traded near the highest in two years.  “The sentiment in the market is to seek havens as unrest
in Middle East may drag the indexes down for the near term,”
said Wu Kan, a  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “Some investors may seek valuation
opportunities after a big plunge, but the overall downward trend
isn’t changing.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 2.8 points, or 0.1 percent to
2,858.32 at 1:23 p.m. The CSI 300 gained 0.2 percent to 3,170.76.  The Shanghai gauge has advanced 1.8 percent this year on
signs the economy is withstanding curbs that drain cash from the
financial system to restrain inflation and limit the risk of
asset bubbles. The government raised banks’ reserve requirement
for a second time this year on Feb. 18, adding to an interest-
rate increase on Feb. 8. Inflation accelerated to a 4.9 percent
annual pace in January, exceeding the government’s 2011 target
for a fourth month.  Zijin Mining led gains for bullion producers, surging 6.8
percent to 8.34 yuan, the most since Oct. 14. Zhongjin Gold Co.
added 4.1 percent to 38.32 yuan, the highest since Jan. 5.    Libya  Violence  Gold prices may advance as tension in the Middle East spurs
demand for precious metals as a store of value. Gold, which
touched an all-time high of $1,431.25 on Dec. 7, traded at
$1,396.20 an ounce in  Singapore . Oil jumped to the highest price
in more than two years in  New York  as intensifying violence in
Libya, the holder of  Africa ’s largest crude reserves, fueled
concern that supplies may be disrupted.  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  vowed to fight a growing
rebellion until his “last drop of blood,” as parts of the
capital of Tripoli resembled a war zone and some of his
followers and troops defected to the opposition.  A gauge tracking health-care companies in the CSI 300
advanced 1.9 percent.  Shanghai  Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co.
rose 1.2 percent to 12.55 yuan. Beijing Tongrentang Co., a
traditional Chinese medicine maker, surged 8.8 percent to 35.66
yuan, the biggest gain since Oct. 26.  China Shenhua Energy Go., the listed unit of nation’s
largest coal producer, advanced 0.8 percent to 25.08 yuan.  Coal Prices  Chinese spot coal prices may rise by 15 percent this year
and 10 percent in 2012 as demand for the fuel from the power,
steel and cement industries may grow as much as 12 percent
annually, UOB-Kay Hian said in a report today. The coal industry
was rated “overweight” by analyst  Helen Lau .  Angang Steel Co. advanced 1 percent to 7.83 yuan. The
company raised prices for March delivery, the Shanghai
Securities News reported. Hot-rolled product prices were
increased by 350 yuan ($53) a metric ton and cold-rolled prices
by 260 yuan a ton, according to the newspaper.  The nation’s consumer-price growth for January and February
may be the highest for the year,  Ba Shusong , a researcher at the
State Council’s Development Research Center, wrote in a
commentary published in the People’s Daily’s overseas edition.  Inflation has curbed consumers’ willingness to spend,
according to a statement released by the Statistics Bureau,
citing Pan Jiancheng, deputy director general of China Economic
Monitoring and Analysis Center. The consumer confidence index
fell to 100 in the fourth quarter.  China Southern Airlines Co. slid 1.7 percent to 8.56 yuan
after the nation’s largest carrier and its rivals raised fuel
surcharges to offset higher oil prices. Air China lost 2 percent
to 11.55 yuan.  Airline Surcharges  China Southern will impose a charge of 90 yuan ($13.7) for
domestic flights of more than 800 kilometers (500 miles),
compared with 70 yuan levied previously, the carrier said on
website yesterday.  China listed companies’ earnings growth may slow to between
16 percent and 25 percent this year from a likely 32 percent
advance in 2010, Citic Securities Co. said.  Profit growth this year may slow to less than 20 percent
should  oil prices  jump and real-estate investment growth ease 23
percent, analysts led by Xi Feng wrote in a report. The forecast
for earnings growth represents a price-to-earnings ratio ranging
from 13 times to 15 times for China’s stocks, close to the
historical bottom, according to the report.  --Irene Shen. Editors: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
