  Hewlett-Packard Co . calls had the
biggest losses in the U.S. options market after the world’s
largest maker of personal computers missed analysts’ second-
quarter sales and profit estimates yesterday.  HP’s March $48 calls to buy the stock and April $52.50
calls had the second-biggest market loss, plunging 96 percent.
The April $52.50 calls were the most-traded yesterday and
accounted for one-fifth of all call volume for the day. March
$49 calls, March $50 calls and March $47 calls all had losses of
at least 94 percent.    Palo Alto , California-based HP tumbled 9.6 percent to
$43.59 today for the biggest loss since August 2004. Excluding
some costs, second-quarter profit will be as much as $1.21 a
share, the company said yesterday in a statement. That missed
the $1.26 predicted by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales
will top out at $31.6 billion, compared with an average estimate
of $32.6 billion.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
