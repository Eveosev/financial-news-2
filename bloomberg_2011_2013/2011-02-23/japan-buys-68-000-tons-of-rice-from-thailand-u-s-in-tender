Japan bought 68,000 metric tons of
rice from the U.S.,  Australia  and Thailand in a tender today,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Of the total, 12,000 tons were from the U.S., 12,000 tons
were from Australia and 44,000 were from Thailand, the ministry
said in a statement.  Japan is self-sufficient in rice. The nation agreed to give
minimum market access to exporting countries at the  Uruguay
Round  of world trade talks in 1993, buying 770,000 tons a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
