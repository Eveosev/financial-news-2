  Virgin Media Inc ., the U.K.’s
second-largest pay-television company, said it’s issuing the
equivalent of 750 million pounds ($1.2 billion) of senior
secured notes to repay some of its loans.  The 10-year bonds will be sold in a private placement and
will rank pari passu with Virgin Media’s senior loans and its
existing senior secured notes due 2018, the Hook, England-based
company said in a statement.  Proceeds of the sale will be used to prepay approximately
533 million pounds of the A portion of Virgin Media’s senior
credit facility, according to the statement. The remainder will
be used to repay part of the B loan.  Virgin Media’s senior credit facility consists of an 800
million-pound A loan maturing in 2014, and a 675 million-pound B
loan and new 200 million-pound A loan expiring in 2015,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There is also a 250
million-pound revolving credit which matures in 2015, data show.  Prices of Virgin Media’s loans remained unchanged at par,
according to Mizuho Financial Group UFJ. Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
