Yemen’s Council of Ministers
approved economic changes to reduce poverty and invest in new
projects, Saba News Agency reported late yesterday.  The measures include a plan to prevent Yemen’s budget
deficit from widening more than 3 percent from 2011 to 2015, the
state-run news agency  reported.   The constitutional reforms are pending approval by the
country’s House of Representatives and Shura council.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
