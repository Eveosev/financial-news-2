  Turkey  has begun the biggest
evacuation effort in the country’s history as it transports
citizens from Libya amid escalating unrest in which one Turkish
citizen has died, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said.  Turkey evacuated 5,099 people in the last 72 hours, using
only the airport in Tripoli, the capital, because the rest of
Libya’s airports are closed, Davutoglu said in a televised press
conference in Ankara today. Libya rejected Turkish requests for
extra evacuation flights, he said. Turkey activated a “Plan B”
to run ferries between Turkey and Libya to evacuate some of the
25,000 Turks working in the country, he said.  The circumstances of the Turkish citizen’s death at a
construction site near Tripoli are unclear, Davutoglu said. He
called on Turks in  Libya  to remain calm. A “crisis table” at
the Foreign Ministry is working 24 hours a day, he said.  The Libyan government’s crackdown on demonstrations has
left almost 300 dead, according to Human Rights Watch, and
helped drive  oil prices  to a 2 1/2-year high. Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  said late yesterday that he would fight the
rebellion until his “last drop of blood.”  Ten other countries have requested Turkish assistance in
evacuating their citizens from Libya, Transport Minister Binali Yildirim said at a conference in Istanbul, without naming them.
Turkish ships will also be carrying food and medicine to Libya,
Davutoglu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Benjamin Harvey  in Ankara at
