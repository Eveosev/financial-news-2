The  New Jersey  Nets acquired two-
time All-Star point guard  Deron Williams  from the Utah Jazz,
days after failing to land forward  Carmelo Anthony , Yahoo Sports
 reported .  Williams, 26, comes to New Jersey in a three-team deal with
the Jazz and Golden State Warriors, Yahoo reported without
saying where it obtained the information. The Jazz get forward
Derrick Favors, the No. 3 pick in the 2010 National Basketball
Association draft; guard Devin Harris; and a 2011 first-round
pick from the Nets.  The Nets also acquired forward Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric from the Warriors for forward Troy Murphy and $3
million, according to Yahoo. The Jazz will receive a 2012 first-
round pick that the Nets acquired from the Warriors.  The  New York Knicks  acquired Anthony, a four-time All-Star,
in a three-team deal completed yesterday. Last week the Nets
were reported by the Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, to
have a tentative deal to acquire Anthony that would have
included Favors, Harris and four first-round draft picks. The
Knicks also were interested in Williams, the New York Times
reported without saying where it got its information.  Nets spokesman Aaron Harris said in a telephone interview
that the team had nothing to announce. The Jazz were unable to
confirm the report, team spokesman Jonathan Rinehart said in an
e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
