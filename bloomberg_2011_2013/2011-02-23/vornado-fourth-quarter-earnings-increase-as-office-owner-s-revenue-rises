  Vornado Realty Trust , the third-
biggest U.S. real estate investment trust by market value, said
fourth-quarter earnings excluding items rose as revenue climbed
and it had a gain on its investment in retailer J.C. Penney Co.  Funds from operations increased to $335.8 million, or $1.76
a share, from $20,000, or zero on a per-share basis, a year
earlier, the New York-based REIT said today in a statement.
Analysts projected FFO of $1.53 a share, the average of 11
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  A rise in earnings from Vornado’s retail operations
bolstered revenue as income from office properties “slipped
modestly,” Ross Smotrich, an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc.
in New York, said today in a research note. Vornado gets a
majority of its revenue from its New York and  Washington  office
buildings.  “The retail portfolio performed well during the holiday
season,” said Smotrich, who rates Vornado shares
“overweight.” “The downtick in office fundamentals was
essentially occupancy-driven as rents were essentially in line
with expectations.”  Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $713 million from $706.6
million a year earlier. Rental revenue climbed 5 percent to $585
million, led by a 13 percent increase in retail rentals to
$121.2 million.  Office Occupancy  Same-store earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization decreased 3.1 percent from the third quarter
for the company’s New York offices, and 0.9 percent for its
Washington offices. Vornado controls 28 office properties in  Manhattan  and 74 in Washington, according to a regulatory filing
today.  Office occupancy in  New York  -- where the company’s
buildings include 1 and 2 Penn Plaza, 1290 Avenue of the
Americas and 770 Broadway -- was 95.6 percent, down from 96
percent in the third quarter. Occupancy in Washington, including
properties in the city’s Maryland and  Virginia  suburbs, was 94
percent, down from 94.3 percent.  Vornado owns 161 retail properties, including seven
regional malls in New York,  New Jersey , Virginia and  San Juan ,  Puerto Rico . Among its 24 “street retail” holdings in
Manhattan are the shops at 1540 Broadway in Times Square,
anchored by Forever 21 and the Disney Store.  J.C. Penney Interest  The company recorded a $140.4 million net gain on its
interest in J.C. Penney, the third-biggest U.S. department store
chain, based on a Dec. 31 closing price of $32.31 and an average
share cost of $26.31. Vornado disclosed in October that it
bought a 9.9 percent stake in the Plano, Texas-based retailer.
Vornado Chairman  Steven Roth , 69, was named to J.C. Penney’s
board last month.  FFO adjusted to remove certain one-time gains and losses
was $1.17 a share, up from $1.02 a year earlier. The items
removed from the company’s adjusted FFO include $97.9 million of
income from the pricing of derivative positions in securities it
holds, a $93.9 million gain from early extinguishment of debt,
and a $94.5 million writedown of costs associated with real
estate development.  Funds from operations exclude depreciation and other items.
The cash-flow measure, used by real estate investment trusts,
doesn’t conform to generally accepted accounting principles.  Fourth-quarter results were announced before the opening of
regular U.S. trading. Vornado, the largest REIT after Simon
Property Group Inc. and Public Storage, fell 94 cents, or 1
percent, to $88.25 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The stock has gained 6 percent this year,
compared with a 3.6 percent increase in the Bloomberg REIT
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
