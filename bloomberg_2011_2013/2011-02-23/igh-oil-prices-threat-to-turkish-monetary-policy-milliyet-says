  Turkey â€™s central bank may have to
revise its  monetary policy  if  oil prices  rise above $110 a
barrel, threatening inflation targets, Milliyet newspaper
reported, citing economists including Guldem Atabay of Ekspres
Invest.  The bank in Ankara bases its policies on a forecast of $95
a barrel and it has already warned that a major inflation threat
