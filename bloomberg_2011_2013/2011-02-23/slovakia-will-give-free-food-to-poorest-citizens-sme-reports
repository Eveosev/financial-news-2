The Slovak government will give free
food to about 370,000 of the countryâ€™s poorest citizens because
prices have risen,  Sme  reported, citing Prime Minster Iveta
Radicova.  About 45,000 tons of grain from state reserves will be used
to make flour and pasta, which will be distributed to the needy
through humanitarian organizations, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
