Spain saw 490,000 mobile-phone users
change operators last month, using a system that allows them to
swap companies while keeping their phone numbers,  Expansion 
reported, without citing anyone. That’s the second-highest
number ever, after the 507,000 who changed in December, it said.    Telefonica SA ’s Movistar and  Vodafone Group Plc  are the
biggest losers in the battle to capture customers from other
operators; France Telecom SA’s Orange and Yoigo, a unit of
Sweden’s TeliaSonera AB, are the gainers, the newspaper said.  The economic crisis, which is encouraging users to look for
the lowest prices, regulation that has made it easier to change
and more competition have encouraged people to switch, Expansion
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
