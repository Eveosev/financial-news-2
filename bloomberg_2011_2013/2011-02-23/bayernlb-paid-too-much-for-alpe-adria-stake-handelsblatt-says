BayernLB paid more to acquire half
of Austrian lender Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank International AG in 2007
than investment bank Rothschild suggested in a report to the
board that it should,  Handelsblatt  reported today, without
saying where it got the information.  The advice to BayernLB’s board was that Alpe-Adria was
worth a maximum of 3.2 billion euros ($4.5 billion) minus a risk
deduction of 200 million euros, according to the newspaper.  The executives told the bank’s supervisory board the
following day that Hypo Alpe-Adria’s value was 3.4 billion
euros; BayernLB paid 1.65 billion euros for the 50 percent
stake, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
