The European Union executive will
hold consultations with stakeholders about security measures for
national carbon registries and addressing the issue of emission
allowances stolen in computer-hacking attacks.  The European Commission also will shortly propose a
modification to the EU regulation on registries that keep tabs
on pollution permits “to give a stronger legal basis for
measures to protect the integrity of the carbon market and
uphold the reputation” of the bloc’s emissions trading system,
it said in a statement today.  The EU executive also plans to intensify work to make the
EU carbon market subject to appropriate financial markets
regulation and will bring forward a public consultation on
enhanced carbon market oversight announced in December,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
