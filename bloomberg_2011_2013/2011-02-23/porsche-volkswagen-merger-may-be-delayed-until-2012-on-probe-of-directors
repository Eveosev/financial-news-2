Porsche SE said a planned merger
with  Volkswagen AG  may not be achieved this year after German
prosecutors informed it that probes against two former
management board members won’t be completed before 2012.  The outcome of the investigations, which relate to alleged
share-price manipulation, “is relevant for the valuation of
damage claims raised against Porsche,” the Stuttgart-based
carmaker said in a statement. “This valuation must be made for
the purposes of the merger.”  Porsche and Volkswagen agreed to combine in August 2009
following a failed attempt by the sports-car maker to take over
its larger rival, based in Wolfsburg. Under the agreement, a
combination is scheduled for the second half of this year.
Porsche shareholders voted in favor of a 5 billion-euro ($6.9
billion) share sale that would facilitate a merger by lowering
debt piled up as part of its earlier takeover attempt.  “Substantial delays” make an eventual merger less likely,
Porsche said, adding that its management board still believes a
combination “can be achieved even after 2011.”  U.S. hedge funds last month appealed a judge’s ruling
dismissing lawsuits they brought claiming Porsche cost them more
than $2 billion by misleading short-sellers in its purchase of
Volkswagen shares in 2008. Porsche maintains it did nothing
wrong. The two carmakers must also resolve tax issues in  Germany 
linked to any merger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
