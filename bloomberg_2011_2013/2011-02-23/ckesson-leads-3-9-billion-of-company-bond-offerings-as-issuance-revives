  McKesson Corp ., the biggest U.S.
drug distributor, led companies that sold $4.36 billion of debt
today as corporate bond issuance revived amid the lowest
investment-grade yields this month.  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, Waste Management Inc.,  Wyndham Worldwide Corp . and American Honda Finance Corp. also
sold debt after $1.25 billion of issuance yesterday, the slowest
start to a week this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has its biggest two-day
decline in six months as violence escalated in  Libya , the latest
country in the region convulsed by protests ignited by the
ouster of Tunisia’s president last month and energized by the
departure of  Egypt ’s President  Hosni Mubarak  on Feb. 11. As
investors sought refuge in U.S. Treasuries, yields on
investment-grade bonds tumbled to the least since Jan. 28 and
speculative-grade yields set a record low.  “A couple of deals that were supposed to price yesterday
probably wanted to wait to see if there was any bit of settling
down in the markets,” said  Rajeev Sharma , a money manager at
First Investors Management Co. in New York who oversees $1.5
billion of investment-grade credit. Companies “are kind of
testing the waters, they know that rates are low, they came down
a little bit yesterday. It’s a good time to hit the market
again.”  McKesson sold $1.7 billion of 5-, 10- and 30-year notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Other Sales  Kinder Morgan Energy sold $1.1 billion of 5- and 30-year
bonds; Waste Management issued $400 million of 10-year notes;
American Honda Finance raised $450 million of 18-month floating-
rate notes; and Wyndham Worldwide priced $250 million of 10-year
notes, Bloomberg data show.  Yields on investment-grade bonds fell to 4.05 percent
yesterday, the least since reaching 3.99 percent on Jan. 28,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
Speculative-grade bond yields fell to a record low of 7.285
percent, the data show.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has decreased
3.49 percent from 3.74 percent on Feb. 8.  “Sovereign risk has been an issue since last year, and
continues to be one,” Sharma said. “What’s happening in the
Middle East is definitely causing a rally in the Treasury market
in the U.S.”  McKesson Notes  McKesson’s $600 million of 5-year notes yield 115 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the $600 million
of 10-year debt pays a 130 basis-point spread, and the $500
million of 30-year bonds pays 150 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Proceeds will help pay back a $1 billion short-term loan
used as part of the acquisition of US Oncology Inc. San
Francisco-based McKesson used a bridge loan to help redeem debt
issued by US Oncology, according to a regulatory filing today.  McKesson agreed to buy US Oncology in November to expand in
cancer care and medicines. The transaction, valued at $2.2
billion, included $415 million of cash and about $1.79 billion
of debt, the company said in a Dec. 30 statement. The bridge
loan borrowings cost 1.76 percent per year and must be repaid by
Dec. 30, 2011, according to today’s filing.  McKesson last issued debt in February 2009, about five
months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
selling $700 million of 5- and 10-year notes, Bloomberg data
show. That offering included $350 million of 6.5 percent debt
that yielded 450 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
