The  African Union Peace and Security
Council  condemned the Libyan government’s crackdown on pro-
democracy protests, saying it violated international
humanitarian law.  Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi has used “indiscriminate and
excessive use of force and lethal weapons against peaceful
protesters,” the 53-member  African Union ’s security body said in
a statement e-mailed today after a meeting in Addis Ababa, the
Ethiopian capital.  “The aspirations of the people of Libya for democracy,
political reform, justice and socio-economic development are
legitimate,” the council said in the statement. Libya’s
“territorial integrity and unity” should be preserved.  The council is planning to send a mission to Libya “as soon
as possible” to assess the situation in the North African
country, council Chairman Kakena S.K. Nangula said earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
