Japanese stock futures and
Australian shares fell, as oil surged to $100 a barrel for the
first time in two years amid an escalating conflict in  Libya .  American depositary receipts of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc., Japan’s biggest publicly traded bank, lost 0.8
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Toyota
Motor Corp., a Japanese automaker that gets about 70 percent
of its sales abroad, dropped 0.6 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd.,
Australia’s biggest mining company, fell 1 percent in Sydney.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,545 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
10,570 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,550 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 0.2 percent today.  “Investors are really uncertain about how soon the Mideast
unrest will end,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about
$450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “Investors are likely to be in a bearish mood.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.6 percent
yesterday in New York, falling for a second day, amid growing
tension in the Middle East and after Hewlett-Packard Co.
reported forecasts that trailed analysts’ estimates. The S&P 500
closed last week at its highest level in 32 months.  $100 Barrels  Crude oil for April delivery increased 2.8 percent to
settle at $98.10 a barrel in  New York , after earlier reaching
$100 a barrel for the first time since October 2008, as Libya’s
uprising threatened to disrupt exports from Africa’s third-
biggest supplier and spread to other Middle East oil producers.
Heavy gunfire broke out in Tripoli again yesterday, army units
defected and a former aide to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
warned the spreading revolt may topple the regime within days.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4 percent by the S&P
500 and 2.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.9 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.6 times for the  S&P 500  and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
