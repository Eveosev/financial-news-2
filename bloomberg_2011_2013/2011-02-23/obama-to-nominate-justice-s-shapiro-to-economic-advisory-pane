President Barack Obama will nominate  Carl Shapiro , the deputy assistant attorney general for
economics at the antitrust division of the  Justice Department ,
to his Council of Economic Advisers, White House press secretary
Jay Carney said.  Shapiro, who is also an economics professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, will replace Cecilia
Rouse, who is leaving the panel at the end of next month.  Obama previously nominated University of Maryland Professor
Katharine Abraham to the vacancy on the panel created when
Austan Goolsbee was named the councilâ€™s chairman last September.  The nominations of Shapiro and Graham are subject to
confirmation by the Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
