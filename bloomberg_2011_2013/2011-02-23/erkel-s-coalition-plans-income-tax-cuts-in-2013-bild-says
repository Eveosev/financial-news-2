The parties in German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government are planning to reduce income tax
rates for low- and medium-income earners,  Bild-Zeitung  reported,
citing financial policy experts in the parties’ parliamentary
groups.  Tax cuts taking effect on Jan. 1, 2013, are possible “if
economic growth maintains its pace,” the newspaper said today,
citing Klaus-Peter Flosbach, finance policy spokesman for
Merkel’s  Christian Democrats  and their Christian Social Union
sister party.  A decision has to be made after a tax estimate in May 2012,
Flosbach told the Berlin-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
