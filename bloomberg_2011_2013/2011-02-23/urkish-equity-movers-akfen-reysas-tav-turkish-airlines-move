Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100

trading in Istanbul. The index has fallen for three straight
days.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in

construction, real estate, tourism and energy, fell 10 kurus, or
0.9 percent, to 10.90 liras. TAV Insaat, a subsidiary of the
company, is a partner in building new international terminals at
the airports in Tripoli and Sebha, Libya, Akfen said in a
statement to the exchange. Akfen is evacuating personnel from
the country until the situation there stabilizes, it said.  TAV

nations in the Middle East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
