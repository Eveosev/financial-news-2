A “sustained spike” in crude  oil
prices  due to the crisis in the Arab world may trigger another
U.S. recession, said economist Cary Leahey, senior managing
director at Decision Economics Inc. in  New York .  “The odds of a recession from the current situation are
probably 1 in 5,” Leahey said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Radio’s “The Hays Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays .
Leahey said crude oil at $150 a barrel or higher will probably
precipitate another contraction.  The current increase in crude oil to about $100 a barrel
from about $80 a barrel may trim a quarter to a half percentage
point from gross domestic product this year, Leahey said.  During the fourth quarter of last year, GDP expanded at a
3.2 percent annual rate, faster than the previous quarter’s pace
of 2.6 percent, according to statistics from the Commerce
Department. Revised figures on fourth-quarter GDP will be issued
Feb. 25.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
