  Pioneer Corp ., the Japanese maker of
car-navigation and audio equipment, persuaded the U.S.
International Trade Commission to take another look at whether
Garmin Ltd.’s global-positioning system devices infringe its
patents.  The six-member ITC  said  in a notice today it will review
some aspects of a commission judge’s December finding that there
was no violation of Pioneer’s patent rights. A final decision is
likely by April 16, according to the agency’s timetable.  A finding of violation may lead the ITC, a quasi-judicial
arbiter of trade disputes, to block imports of Garmin GPS
devices into the U.S. Pioneer filed the complaint in 2009,
claiming Schaffhausen, Switzerland-based Garmin and  Honeywell
International Inc . were infringing patents related to GPS and
automobile-multimedia devices. Honeywell later settled the case.  The case is In the Matter of Certain Multimedia Display and
Navigation Devices and Systems, 337-694.  To contact the reporter on this story:
