  BlackRock Inc ., the world’s biggest
money manager, acquired a 25 percent stake in a community
banking cooperative started by Lee Sachs, a former aide to
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Terms weren’t disclosed.  Alliance Partners, based in  Chevy Chase , Maryland, has
assembled a cooperative network of banks called BancAlliance,
the company said in a statement. BancAlliance seeks to provide
its members with more lending opportunities to reduce their
reliance on real estate loans and assets.  “We see the BancAlliance program as a constructive
opportunity for community banks across the country to diversify
their asset portfolios,” Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock’s chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  Sachs last month started Alliance Partners, aimed at
helping smaller regional banks lend to a wider base of
borrowers. Lenders that join BancAlliance’s network will be able
to elect the partnership’s board of directors.  BlackRock, based in  New York , manages $3.56 trillion in
mutual funds, institutional accounts and exchange-traded funds.
The firm in December 2009 acquired  Barclays Global Investors  to
more than double assets under management and add passive  index
funds  to its line-up of actively managed funds.  In 2008, BlackRock and Highfields Capital Management LP
backed former Countrywide Financial Corp. president Stanford
Kurland to form Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company
LLC. The firm, dubbed PennyMac, seeks to buy delinquent
residential mortgages.  BlackRock may partner with BancAlliance to bring other new
products to community banks and smaller lenders, Matthew Botein,
head of BlackRock’s alternative investments and the firm’s
special-situations unit, said in a telephone interview today.  “We helped to create PennyMac during the height of the
mortgage crisis,” Botein said. “The BancAlliance partnership
is an opportunity to bring innovation and fiduciary principles
to an important set of members in the financial system, the
community banks,” Botein said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
