  Delta Air Lines Inc ., the world’s
second-biggest carrier, should go to trial over Virgin Atlantic
Airways Ltd.’s claims it infringed a patent for its upper-class
seating system, a U.K. appeals court ruled.  A November 2010 ruling in Delta’s favor erred because the
patent covering the seating system applies to seats assembled
off the aircraft, not just those on board, Justice Robin Jacob
wrote at the Court of Appeal in London today.  “The case must proceed to trial, where, I understand,
Delta will take a number of other non-infringement points,”
Judge Jacob wrote on behalf of a three-judge panel.  Virgin, the long-haul carrier controlled by billionaire  Richard Branson , sued Atlanta-based Delta in 2008 for using
upper-class seats designed by  Premium Aircraft Interiors Group
Ltd. , a U.K. aircraft-interior designer that was sued by Virgin
a year earlier for about 49 million pounds ($79.6 million).  The ability to provide comfortable reclining seats on long-
haul routes can play a vital part in the success of an airline,
according to an earlier judgment in the case. When Virgin
introduced its flat-bed  seats  in 2003 it increased its market
share on long-haul routes by 12 percent, it said.  Delta spokeswoman Betsy Talton didn’t immediately return a
call before business hours today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
