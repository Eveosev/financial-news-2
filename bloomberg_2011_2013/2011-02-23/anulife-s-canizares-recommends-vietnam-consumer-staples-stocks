Mark Canizares, Ho Chi Minh City-
based head of equities at Manulife Asset Management   Vietnam ),
which oversees about $280 million of assets, commented on the
Vietnamese stock market by e-mail today.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, snapped five days of declines, gaining 0.1
percent to 470.67, as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung will sign a resolution today
directing the central bank and ministries to curb inflation by
tightening monetary and fiscal policy, Le Xuan Nghia, an adviser
to the premier, said yesterday.  “The resolution can be viewed positively as this
demonstrates the commitment of the government to ensure that
macro concerns, such as inflation rising and high credit growth,
are addressed.  “This news, along with cheaper valuations, might have
helped the stocks recover today.  “In the short-term, there would be some negative reaction
first as the market fully prices in all these macro risks, such
as inflation.  “But with price levels falling, and earnings still looking
bright especially for the domestic consumption space, some
sectors such as consumer staples are starting to become
attractive again.”  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
