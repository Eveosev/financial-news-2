Zon Multimedia SGPS SA,  Portugal ’s
biggest cable-television provider, predicted that sales will
increase this year after revenue per user advanced in 2010,
though growth will slow as the country’s economy struggles.  “2011 will be a difficult and challenging year but we’re
starting it in great conditions,” Chief Financial Officer Jose Pedro Pereira da Costa said in an interview. Revenue will
increase at a slower pace than in 2010, when sales rose
7.3 percent to 872.3 million euros ($1.2 billion), he said today
in a conference call with analysts.  Zon, spun off from  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA  in 2007, has
completed most planned investments to upgrade its network to
gain more phone customers while facing competition for
television subscribers from its former parent. The percentage of
clients with “triple-play” services of phone, Internet and TV
advanced to 55 percent in 2010 from 41 percent a year earlier,
Lisbon-based Zon said last night in a statement.  Portugal is carrying out the deepest spending cuts in more
than three decades to convince investors it can narrow its
budget gap further after  Greece ’s debt crisis led to a surge in
borrowing costs for high-deficit euro nations. The Bank of
Portugal predicted Jan. 11 that the economy will contract
1.3 percent this year because of the measures.  Share Performance  Zon shares were unchanged at 3.80 euros as of 2:16 p.m.,
after falling as much as 1.4 percent earlier in the Lisbon
trading day. The stock has gained 2.6 percent in 12 months.  “The key focus for 2011 is not so much how much revenue
will grow but much more our ability to improve quite
substantially our cash flow generation capacity,” Pereira da
Costa told analysts. “We have a much higher degree of control
on that front, namely on  capital spending  but also on margins.”  The company forecast that earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales will
advance by 1 percentage point in 2011. The Ebitda margin was
34.7 percent at the end of last year.  Zon’s average monthly revenue per user rose 4.8 percent to
35.4 euros in 2010. Capital spending climbed 16 percent to
248 million euros, the company said yesterday. Zon forecast on
Feb. 16 that capital expenditure will decline to 155 million
euros to 160 million euros this year, or about 18 percent
of sales. In the next two to three years, it may drop to
15 percent, Pereira da Costa said.  Reduced capital spending will boost free  cash flow  and let
the company pay down debt and raise dividends, Chief Executive
Officer  Rodrigo Costa  said this month. The company said in
October it has no refinancing needs until mid-2012. The
executives declined to give more details today.  Revenue rose 2.6 percent to 221 million euros in the fourth
quarter and net income gained 26 percent to 3.9 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
