Royal DSM NV, the world’s largest
vitamin maker, abandoned a plan to buy Danisco A/S after failing
to agree on a price, leaving the way open to DuPont Co.’s $5.8
billion offer for the Danish food-ingredient maker.  DSM built a 4.95 percent stake in Danisco in 2007 and early
2008 to get a strategic footing in the company, Chief Financial
Officer Rolf-Dieter Schwalb said in an interview today, after
DSM reported quarterly earnings. The Dutch maker of enzymes and
performance polymers instead went on to buy Martek Biosciences
for $1.09 billion.  Western chemical makers are scrambling to buy science-based
businesses that offer higher-margins and faster growth, along
with less competition from petrochemical makers in the Middle
East and  Asia . Martek, a U.S. maker of nutritional supplements,
had also drawn the interest of personal-care ingredient maker
Croda International Plc.  “In hindsight, it’s been a very rewarding investment, but
we didn’t do it from a financial investment point of view,”
Chief Executive Officer Feike Sijbesma said on a conference call
today.  DSM will decide on whether to accept DuPont’s agreed offer
for the company closer to the April 1 deadline. It stands to
make a pretax profit of about 129 million euros ($168 million)
if it tenders its stake. Elliott Associates LP, a New York-based
hedge fund, and Copenhagen-based retirement fund AP Pension are
among investors who have spurned the bid for being too low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
