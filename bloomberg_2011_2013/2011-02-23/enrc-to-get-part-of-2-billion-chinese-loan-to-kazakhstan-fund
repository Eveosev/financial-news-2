Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.
will get funds from China Development Bank Corp. as part of a
loan package of more than $2 billion agreed on by  Kazakhstan ’s
National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna with the Chinese lender.  The Kazakh state-owned fund signed two deals in Beijing
with the Chinese bank yesterday during a visit by President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, Samruk-Kazyna said in an e-mailed response
to questions. ENRC’s Sokolovsko-Sarbaiskoye GOK iron-ore unit
will get part of a $1.7 billion loan, while its TNK Kazchrome
unit will receive as much as $400 million, Samruk-Kazyna said.  ENRC, a producer of ferrochrome, aluminum and iron ore in
Kazakhstan, is seeking funds to diversify its industrial-metals
output and geographic reach as prices for the raw materials
surge. The company plans to spend $2.6 billion developing an
iron-ore mine it bought in  Brazil , and is investing in copper
and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo through Central
African Mining & Exploration Co.  “ENRC was provided with $1.5 billion for further
development of Sokolovsko-Sarbaiskoye GOK and $400 million for
chromium industry development,” Nazarbayev said in Tianjin,
according to Kazakh state-owned news service  Kazinform .  Asel Kurmanalieva, a spokeswoman for ENRC, declined to
comment when contacted by telephone in the Kazakh capital,
Astana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
