Asian currencies rose from a one-
week low on speculation regional central banks will raise  interest rates  to counter the effect of a surge in oil prices on
inflation, boosting the yield premium on local assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies, added 0.2 percent to 116.23
as of 4:33 p.m. in  Hong Kong . It earlier reached a low of 115.95.
South  Korea ’s won advanced 0.3 percent to 1,124 per dollar and
Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent to 8,856, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil prices climbed to the highest level in more than two
years as intensifying violence in  Libya  stoked concern that
supplies will be disrupted should the turmoil spread to other
crude-producing countries in the Middle East and North Africa.  China ,  India , Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam all
increased borrowing costs this year, widening the gap with the  Federal Reserve ’s near-zero benchmark rate, as Asia leads a
global economic recovery.  “Asia is the region where interest-rate hikes are expected
in some countries,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency
strategist at Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd. in Tokyo. “That
means regional currencies are also on a trend of appreciation.
The region’s economy remains quite solid.”  Crude climbed 2.4 percent to $95.96 a barrel and earlier
reached $96.09, the highest level since October 2008. The price
rose 8.6 percent yesterday.  Inflation Data  A report today showed Malaysian consumer prices rose 2.4
percent in January from a year earlier, the fastest pace since
May 2009, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Singapore’s inflation accelerated to 5.5
percent in January from 4.6 percent the previous month, official
data released today show.  Developing economies in Asia will expand 8.4 percent this
year, compared with 4.3 percent for Latin America and 2.5
percent for advanced countries, according to International
Monetary Fund forecasts released last month.  The won snapped a two-day loss after Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said  South Korea  needs to make contingency plans for
rising prices. Inflation can become a “threat” to peoples’
livelihood, he said. The Bank of Korea unexpectedly left its
benchmark rate unchanged at 2.75 percent this month even after
consumer prices climbed 4.1 percent in January from a year
earlier, breaching the central bank’s ceiling of 4 percent.
Policy makers next meet on March 10.  “The road is clear for another rate hike at the next
central bank meeting,” said Cliff Tan, head of emerging-markets
currency research at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “This
would normally be consistent with a slightly stronger currency
as well, though this isn’t always the case with Korea.”    Vietnam  Tightens  Vietnam’s central bank raised its reverse repurchase rate
yesterday, the second increase in less than a week. The bank
lifted the rate it charges commercial banks in daily open-market
operations to 12 percent from 11 percent. The government will
focus on the “main task” of curbing price gains in 2011,
according to a statement on its website today.  Consumer prices rose 12.31 percent from a year earlier this
month, following a 12.17 percent increase in January, according
to figures released by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi
today. That’s the biggest advance since February 2009. Prices
increased 2.09 percent from last month.  Elsewhere, the Singapore dollar rose 0.2 percent to
S$1.2770 against the greenback, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  Chinese yuan  advanced 0.09 percent to 6.5743 and
the Indian rupee strengthened 0.2 percent to 45.1765. The
Vietnamese dong gained 0.2 percent to 20,835, while the
Malaysian ringgit declined 0.2 percent to 3.0470.  To contact the reporter on this story:
