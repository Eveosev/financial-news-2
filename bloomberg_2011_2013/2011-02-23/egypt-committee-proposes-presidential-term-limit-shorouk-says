An Egyptian constitutional committee
is proposing to limit the time presidents can serve to two four-
year terms, Al Shorouk newspaper reported today, citing
unidentified officials.  The proposals would also make it easier for independents
and members of political parties to contest presidential
elections, the Cairo-based newspaper said. Sobhi Saleh, a member
of the committee set up by the country’s ruling military
council, said by telephone he couldn’t divulge the details of
the proposed amendments before they were officially announced.    Egypt ’s current constitution, which has been suspended
following the end of the 30-year rule of former President  Hosni Mubarak , sets no limit on how many times the president can run
for office, with each term spanning six years. Under the new
proposals, presidential hopefuls would be able to run for office
after securing 30,000 signatures from eligible citizens in 12
provinces or 150 signatures from members of the upper and lower
houses of parliament, the newspaper said.  Other suggestions include ensuring judicial supervision of
elections and stipulating that an extension of a state of
emergency beyond six months would require a national referendum,
Al Shorouk reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
