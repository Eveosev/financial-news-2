  Erste Group Bank AG , eastern  Europe â€™s second-biggest lender, may say fourth-quarter profit
climbed 48 percent as bad debt charges declined.  Net income probably rose to 270 million euros ($384
million) from 183 million euros a year earlier, according to the
mean estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The Vienna-
based bank is due to report results on Feb. 25 at 7:30 a.m.  Loan-loss provisions fell 21 percent to the lowest level
since the first quarter of 2009, according to analyst estimates.
Erste and rivals  UniCredit SpA  and  Raiffeisen Bank International
AG , the biggest and third-biggest lenders in emerging Europe
respectively, boosted provisions for delinquent loans in the
past two years as the region entered recession.  Bad debt charges in the  Czech Republic , where Erste owns
the biggest lender, are declining as the economy rebounds. That
may help Erste post a record profit of 1.27 billion euros this
year, according to analyst estimates.  The following is a table of analyst estimates and results
from the previous and year-earlier quarters. The figures are in
millions of euros apart from non-performing loans, which are
given as a percentage of total lending.       The following banks participated in the survey: Atlantik,
BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Concorde Securities, Credit Suisse,
Cyrrus, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, ING, KBC, Keefe Bruyette &

Centrobank, silkroutefinancial, UBS, UniCredit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
