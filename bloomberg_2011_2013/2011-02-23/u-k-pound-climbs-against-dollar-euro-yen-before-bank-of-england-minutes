The pound strengthened against the
dollar before the  Bank of England  publishes the minutes of its
most recent interest-rate meeting.  The British currency also advanced versus the yen and the
Swiss franc. Minutes from the central bank’s Feb. 10 meeting,
when it kept its benchmark rate unchanged at a record low
0.5 percent, may show a divide on the Monetary Policy Committee,
which has been split three ways since October.  Adam Posen  has
called for an expansion of the bank’s bond-purchase plan, while
Andrew Sentance and  Martin Weale  want the key rate increased.  A small increase in the rate may prevent a more rapid
tightening later, Weale said in a BBC Radio 4 interview
broadcast on Feb. 21.  The pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.6199 as of 8:03 a.m. in  London  and 0.3 percent to 133.95 yen. The British currency was
little changed at 84.68 pence per euro and strengthened
0.2 percent to 1.5172 Swiss francs.  Sterling advanced 3.8 percent versus the dollar this year
and 1.3 percent against the euro amid speculation the Bank of
England will raise its main interest rate this year to curb an
inflation rate that’s double its target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
