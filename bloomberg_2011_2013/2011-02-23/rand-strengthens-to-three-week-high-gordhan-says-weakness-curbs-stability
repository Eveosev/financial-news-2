South Africa’s rand gained to the
strongest level in three weeks against the dollar after Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said a sharp depreciation in the rand
may undermine the economy’s stability and stoke inflation.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy appreciated 0.8
percent to 7.1043 per dollar by 2:11 p.m. in Johannesburg.  “Overly rapid currency depreciation carries risks to
macroeconomic stability,” Gordhan said today in his budget
speech to Parliament in  Cape Town . “Changes in the volume and
direction of capital flows may be significant over the year
ahead, and are largely beyond our control or influence.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
