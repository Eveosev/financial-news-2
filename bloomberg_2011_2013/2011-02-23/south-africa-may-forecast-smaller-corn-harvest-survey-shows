  South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, may forecast a smaller crop of the
grain in the 2010-11 season, a survey showed.  The government may say farmers will reap 11.5 million
metric tons, down from the 12.82 million tons harvested in the
prior season, according to the median estimate of 14 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg. Forecasts ranged from 12.8 million tons
to 11 million tons.  The government’s  Crop Estimates Committee  is scheduled to
release its first assessment of the harvest tomorrow at 3:30
p.m. Johannesburg time.  White corn for July delivery dropped by the maximum daily
limit of 80 rand, or 4.8 percent, to close at 1,574 rand ($221)
a ton on the South African Futures Exchange today. Meal made
from the grain is the country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for July delivery fell 80 rand, or 4.7 percent,
to 1,610 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as  animal feed  in
South Africa. The U.S. and  Argentina  are the world’s biggest
corn exporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
