BioVerde Industria e Comercio de
Biocombustiveis SA  signed a cooperation agreement with  Spain ’s
Integral Bioenergies Systems, S.L. to produce biodiesel derived
from animal and vegetable oil and increase margins by reducing
its dependence on commodities.  “This agreement opens a new paradigm in the biodiesel
industry,” said Chief Executive Officer Ailton Domingues in a
Feb. 18 interview in Sao Paulo. “We will have margins above the
traditional biodiesel market, mainly when commodities prices are
high.”  Under the accord, BioVerde will use technology developed by
the Valencia-based group, which converts fatty acid into
biodiesel at a rate of up to 98 percent. Domingues said the cost
of the raw materials doesn’t move in tandem with commodities
prices, unlike products such as soy, which increased 34,1
percent in 2010.  BioVerde plans to expand its production more than sixfold
to 1.2 billion liters by 2013, when its two mills will be
operating at full capacity. The company currently produces 181
million liters. By the end of this year, output should reach 400
million liters, Domingues said.  The company may go public in 2013, when revenue may reach 2
billion reais, said Domingues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
