  Toll Brothers Inc ., the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, reported an unexpected first-quarter profit
as the company increased revenue, cut costs and reduced property
impairments.  Net income for the three months ended Jan. 31 was $3.4
million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a loss of $40.8
million, or 25 cents, a year earlier, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts projected a
loss of 8 cents a share, the average of 16 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Meaningful headway was made on the cost side of the
ledger,” Stephen East and Paul Przybylski, analysts with New
York-based Ticonderoga Securities LLC, wrote in a note to
clients today. “Much heavy lifting is still needed, but the
results are encouraging.”  Toll Brothers reduced expenses and sold homes at higher
prices to counter slumping demand for new properties. About
321,000 new homes were sold last year, the fewest in records
dating to 1963, the Commerce Department reported Jan. 26. Sales
weakened after the federal program of tax credits worth as much
as $8,000 for first-time homebuyers expired last spring.  Toll Brothers said it ended the quarter with a backlog of
$825.2 million and 1,472 homes. The company predicted sales of
2,200 to 2,800 properties this fiscal year at a price of
$540,000 to $565,000.  Buyers ‘Concerned’  “We’re cautious,” Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley
said in an interview today with  Carol Massar  and  Matt Miller  on
Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” program. “The buyers
are still concerned.”  Toll Brothers’ revenue rose to $334.1 million from $326.7
million. The company sold 570 homes for an average price of
$586,000, compared with 596 for an average of $548,154 a year
earlier. Buyers signed contracts for 548 new homes, 4 percent
more than a year ago.  “In many places, the market appears to be improving,”
Yearley said in the statement. “These include the metro  Washington , D.C.-to-metro Boston corridor, especially our metro  New York City  urban projects, as well as  Texas .”  Toll Brothers shares increased 44 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
$21.20 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock rose 12 percent this year, compared with a
1.6 percent gain for the 12-member Standard & Poor’s
Supercomposite Homebuilding Index.  Drop in Writedowns  Toll Brothers’ results included $25.1 million of charges. A
year earlier, the pretax writedowns totaled $33.4 million. The
quarter also included a $20.4 million tax benefit.  The company operates in 19 states, building single-family
homes, urban condominiums, golf course developments and “active
adult” communities. Last year, Toll Brothers started Gibraltar
Capital and Asset Management, a division to invest in distressed
real estate.  Gibraltar contributed a “small net profit” in the first
quarter to Toll Brothers’ earnings, Yearley said in the
statement.  The company ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash. It
spent $146 million of cash in the quarter to buy property and
land-related notes. Toll had $798 million available under a bank
credit agreement at the end of the first quarter.  “The territories that are good, are good, but there’s
plenty of territories out there that are bad and the uptick is
very slight,” Robert Toll, the company’s chairman, said in a
conference call with analysts.  The company’s cancellation rate was 5.7 percent in the
quarter compared with 6.7 percent in the same period a year
earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:  John Gittelsohn  in New York at
