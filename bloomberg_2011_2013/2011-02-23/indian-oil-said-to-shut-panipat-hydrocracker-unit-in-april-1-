Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s
largest refiner, plans to shut a hydrocracker unit at its
Panipat refinery in northern  India  for 25 days in April for
maintenance, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The unit, which can process 1.7 million metric tons a year,
will be closed for scheduled annual servicing, said the one of
the people, who declined to be identified as they were not
authorized to speak to the media. The company doesn’t disclose
its maintenance schedule.  Hydrocrackers convert heavy hydrocarbons into lighter fuels
like high-octane gasoline.  Mumbai-based Indian Oil in November surpassed Reliance
Industries Ltd. as the biggest refiner in the country after
increasing capacity at Panipat by 25 percent to 15 million
metric tons a year.  The combined crude processing capacity of Indian Oil’s
refineries is 65.7 million metric tons a year, or about 1.3
million barrels per day, according to its  website , equivalent to
almost 35 percent of the nation’s refining capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
