  China ’s benchmark money-market rate
was little changed near a three-week high as banks conserve cash
before an increase in their reserve-requirement ratios takes
effect tomorrow.  Major lenders will have to set aside 19.5 percent of their
deposits as reserves, half a percentage point more than at
present, the People’s Bank of China said Feb. 18. Liquidity was
also tight owing to a planned 23 billion yuan ($3.5 billion)
convertible bond sale by China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.,  Asia ’s biggest oil refiner, which was approved today.  The money-market rate is being “driven by the reserve-
requirement hike and demand for the Sinopec bond,” said Wee- Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong .  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of the availability
of funds, was at 6.24 percent as of 11 a.m. in  Shanghai , little
changed from yesterday’s 6.26 percent, according to a daily
fixing from the National Interbank Funding Center. The rate
surged 328 basis points to 6.09 percent on Feb. 21. That was the
biggest increase since 2004, when Bloomberg started compiling
the data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  February’s increase in banks’ reserve-requirement ratio
will be the fifth since October. It comes after consumer prices
climbed 4.9 percent from a year earlier in January, following a
4.6 percent increase the previous month, official figures show.
November’s 5.1 percent gain was the biggest since July 2008.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase was unchanged at 3.87
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on
the government’s 3.77 percent bond due December 2020 slipped one
basis point to 4.02 percent, according to Chinabond, the
nation’s biggest debt-clearing house.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
