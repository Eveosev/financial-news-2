Right On Co., a Japanese retailer of
jeans and casual wear, jumped to the highest in six months in
Tokyo trading after reporting the first gain in same-store sales
in more than two years.  The shares surged by the daily limit of 80 yen, or 17
percent, to 538 yen, at the market close in the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, a level not seen since August 16. The company had the
second-biggest increase among the 1,666 companies in the Topix
index.  The company, based in Ibaraki prefecture, near Tokyo, said
same-store sales rose 3.4 percent in the month ended Feb. 20
from a year earlier as average spending per customer increased
4.6 percent. That was the first gain in its monthly sales since
November 2008, according to the company’s statements.  The stock has increased 15 percent this year, compared with
the Topix Index’s 5.4 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on the story:
