LaBranche & Co. shareholders sued to
stop the market-maker’s planned sale to financial services firm  Cowen Group Inc ., saying they’re not getting fair value.  The deal is structured to deter competing bids and will
result in LaBranche stockholders ceding control for less than
the company’s true value, the investors said in a complaint
filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court.  “The proposed transaction is the product of a flawed
process that is designed to ensure the sale of LaBranche to
Cowen on terms preferential to Cowen, but detrimental” to
LaBranche shareholders, Stanley and Barbara Moskal said in their
complaint, which seeks class-action status.  Under the proposed deal announced Feb. 17, Cowen will
acquire LaBranche in an all-stock transaction. LaBranche
shareholders will receive 0.998 share of Cowen common stock for
each LaBranche share. LaBranche is a market-maker in options,
exchange-traded funds and futures.  Jeffrey McCutcheon, LaBranche’s chief financial officer,
didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. Dan Gagnier, a
Cowen spokesman, declined to immediately comment. Both
companies, which are based in  New York , were sued.  The case is Stanley Moskal v. LaBranche & Co. Inc., 650472-
2011, New York State Supreme Court   Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
