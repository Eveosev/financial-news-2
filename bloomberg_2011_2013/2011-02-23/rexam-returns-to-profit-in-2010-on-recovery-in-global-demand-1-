  Rexam Plc , the world’s biggest
beverage-can maker, returned to profit in 2010 as the global
economic recovery pushed up demand and prices.  Net income was 124 million pounds ($201 million), compared
with a net loss of 29 million pounds a year earlier, London-
based Rexam said today in a statement. Sales rose 2 percent to
4.96 billion pounds. Rexam declared a total dividend of 12 pence
a share.  “In 2010 we delivered record profits and cash flow,”
Chief Executive Officer Graham Chipchase said in the statement.
“We expect 2011 to be a year of continued progress” with a
focus on “optimizing cash and controlling costs.”  Rexam, reducing expenses to help restore profitability,
said Dec. 15 it planned to sell a division making container
lids. Rexam hired  Barclays Capital  to manage the sale, Chipchase
said today in a phone interview, valuing the unit’s net assets
at 230 million pounds. The company reported a loss of 112
million pounds from discontinued operations at the unit.  Rexam dropped as much as 4.9 percent to 352 pence in London
trading, the biggest intraday decline in almost seven months.
The stock was at 361.2 pence as of 8:10 a.m. local time.  The company’s beverage-can volumes grew by 2 percent over
the year, driven by demand for specialty cans “across all our
regions and good growth in  South America ,” it said.  Rexam saved 88 million pounds from cost cutting and
“restructuring” last year, Chipchase said. The company plans
to reduce expenses by 30 million pounds this year, he said.  Net debt fell to 1.68 billion pounds by the end of 2010
from 1.83 billion pounds a year earlier, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
