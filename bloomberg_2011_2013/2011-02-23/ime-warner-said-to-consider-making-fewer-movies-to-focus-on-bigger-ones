  Time Warner Inc . is considering
reducing further the number of movies it makes to focus on big-
budget pictures, a person familiar with the situation said.  The maker of the   Harry Potter ” and “Dark Knight”
movies hasn’t set specific plans or decided how to allocate
cutbacks among studios at the Warner Bros. film unit, said the
person, who spoke anonymously because the discussions aren’t
public. Any changes would affect the releases starting in 2013,
the person said.  A reduction would be the second for Time Warner since 2008,
when the company closed its Warner Independent and Picturehouse
units, and folded New Line Cinema into Warner Bros. Then, the
company also said it wanted to focus on so-called event movies,
which Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes says are more likely to
turn a profit.  “We’re focusing even more of our resources on event
films,” Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes said
in a Feb. 2 conference call. “Warners produces more of these
films each year than any studio, and it distributes them better
than any studio. Importantly, event films also tend to be more
consistently profitable for us than smaller movies.”  The Deadline Hollywood website reported earlier today that
Time Warner planned to cut production at New Line. Candice
McDonough, a spokeswoman for New Line, didn’t immediately
respond to a telephone request for comment.  Time Warner, based in New York, fell 48 cents to $37.70
today in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael White  in  Los Angeles  at
