  Goodman Group , Australia’s biggest
industrial real estate investment trust by market value, will
boost its share of earnings from overseas and seek to expand in
Europe and  Asia , Chief Executive Officer Greg Goodman said.  “Half our earnings are now coming from overseas,” Goodman
said in a telephone interview after the company’s first-half
results today. “Moving forward, that will be a greater
percentage of earnings, certainly in 2012 and 2013. We’re
looking at assets at the moment, primarily to help build out our
European and Asian businesses.”  The Sydney-based company returned to profit in the six
months ended Dec. 31 with net income of A$226 million ($226
million) from a loss of A$500.3 million a year earlier, it said
in a statement to the Australian stock exchange. Operating
profit rose to A$170.5 million, compared with A$138.5 million a
year ago.  The company is working on development projects in  Germany ,  France , Poland and the U.K., Goodman said. It has restructured
its Japanese business, and has more than 400,000 square meters
of developments and land sites in  China , he said.  Goodman is awaiting ING Industrial Fund shareholder
approval, expected on March 17, for its A$1.47 billion offer to
buy the fund, after winning the backing of ING Real Estate
Investment Management on Jan. 4. The company led a consortium
that included three pension and sovereign wealth funds,
identified as China Investment Corp., the Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board and Dutch pension fund Algemene Pensioen Groep
NV by the Australian newspaper.  The acquisition is expected to add to Goodman’s management
income and to earnings in the 2012 fiscal year, the company said,
without specifying an amount.  Goodman will pay a dividend of 1.5 Australian cents per
share for the half, it said. The stock added 0.8 percent to 67.5
Australian cents at the 4:10 p.m. close of trade in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
