The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell for
a fourth day, its longest losing streak since October, as Libyan
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  vowed to fight a rebellion.  Air France-KLM Group, Europe’s second-biggest airline by
sales, retreated 1.4 percent as  oil prices  advanced.  OMV AG ,
central Europe’s biggest oil company, sank 5.8 percent after
saying production will come to a standstill in Libya.  Cable &
Wireless Communications Plc  jumped 6.2 percent after agreeing to
sell its Bermuda unit.  The Stoxx 600 fell 1.1 percent to 282.38 at the close in
London, as all 19 industry groups retreated. The measure has
still rallied 2.4 percent this year amid speculation the
economic recovery will continue. It peaked at the highest level
since August 2008 last week.  As Qaddafi vowed to fight the uprising, parts of the
capital of Tripoli resembled a war zone and some of his
followers and troops defected to the opposition. In Tripoli,
bodies were left in the streets after an attack on protesters by
pro-Qaddafi gunmen, the opposition National Front for the
Salvation of  Libya  said.  Libya, holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves, is the
latest nation to be rocked by protests ignited by last month’s
ouster of Tunisia’s president and fanned by the Feb. 11 fall of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.  “I’m a little more concerned than I was” days ago,
Richard Lacaille, who oversees $2 trillion as chief investment
officer at State Street Global Advisors in London, told
Bloomberg Television’s On the Move with Francine Lacqua. “This
is a vindication of a long-term strategy. You can ride out the
bumps.”  National Benchmarks  National benchmark indexes slid in 15 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s CAC 40 lost 0.9 percent. Germany’s
DAX dropped 1.7 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 retreated 1.2
percent.  “Ongoing fears over the state of affairs in North  Africa 
and the risk of contagion elsewhere in the region look set to
sustain a bear market attitude for some time yet,”  Ben Potter ,
a research analyst at IG Markets in Melbourne, wrote in a note.  Air France slipped 1.4 percent to 11.62 euros.  Crude for April delivery gained as much as 97 cents to
$96.39 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest since Oct. 2, 2008.  OMV sank 5.8 percent to 30.08 euros. The stock declined
after Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer said he
expects “production will come to a standstill for a certain
period of time for safety reasons” in Libya and fourth-quarter
profit missed analysts’ estimates.  Cable & Wireless Communications  Cable & Wireless Communications, which split from its
parent company in March 2010, surged 6.2 percent to 49.33 pence.
The company agreed to sell its Bermuda unit to The Bragg group
for $70 million.  European carmakers posted the worst performance among 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600, led by declines in Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG. The world’s biggest makers of
luxury cars retreated 3.5 percent to 58.30 euros and 3.3 percent
to 51.29 euros, respectively.    Accor SA  dropped 3.7 percent to 33.91 euros, even as
Europe’s biggest hotel company reported full-year earnings
before interest and taxes of 446 million euros ($612 million),
compared with 235 million euros a year earlier. The company said
it will accelerate an asset disposal plan and forecast that
market growth last year will continue in 2011.    Natixis , MTU  Natixis SA climbed 4.3 percent to 4.30 euros. The
investment-banking and asset-management unit of France’s second-
largest bank by branches said fourth-quarter profit fell 48
percent to 442 million euros on lower revenue and after it
didn’t repeat tax gains. Profit beat analyst estimates.    MTU Aero Engines Holding AG , the German partner in a group
building engines for Airbus SAS’s A400M military-transport
plane, slid 4.2 percent to 48.26 euros after earnings and a 2011
forecast fell short of analysts’ expectations.    Swedish Match AB  soared 5.6 percent to 197.40 kronor.
Europe’s largest maker of smokeless tobacco products said
fourth-quarter net income rose to 1.07 billion kronor ($0.17
billion) from 595 million kronor a year earlier.    Lafarge SA , the world’s biggest cement maker, lost 2.2
percent to 44.51 euros. The company’s long- and short-term
credit ratings may be cut to junk, Standard & Poor’s said,
citing “weak” credit metrics that “are showing no signs of
improvement.”    Transgene SA  plunged 19 percent to 12.00 euros.  Roche
Holding AG  ended an agreement to license the rights to the
French company’s experimental vaccine for cervical lesions.
Roche ended the agreement because of “its own strategic
reasons,” and not because of data about the drug, Transgene
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
