The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is examining potential conflicts of interest in the
market for shares of private companies such as Facebook Inc. and
Twitter Inc., the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The regulator is concerned about the “middleman” role
played by market-makers such as SecondMarket Inc. and SharesPost
Inc. that specialize in privately held shares, the newspaper
said.  SEC officials believe the “middleman” role might cause
conflicts of interest, in view of the difficulty of ascribing a
fair value to privately traded shares; they take the view that
some of the firms promoting the buying and selling of shares in
private companies should be registered as broker-dealer
operations, the Journal said  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
