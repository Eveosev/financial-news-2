  South Korea ’s trade commission
will seek the imposition of a 13.17 percent anti-dumping duty on
Japanese stainless-steel plates over the next five years.  The Korea Trade Commission will ask the finance minister to
impose the tax after a probe found dumping of the product by
Japan hurt the domestic industry, the Ministry of Knowledge
Economy said in an e-mailed statement today.  The decision came after the commission started an
investigation in April that followed a complaint from DKC Corp.,
South Korea’s sole maker of the product, that its sales fell and
it swung to an operating loss because of the imports.  The market for the product, used in petrochemical and
desalination plants, was estimated to be worth about 350 billion
won ($312 million) a year between 2008 and 2009, it said.
Japanese products accounted for about 27 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
