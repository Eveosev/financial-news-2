  SunTrust Banks Inc ., the Georgia
lender that has yet to repay $4.85 billion in taxpayer bailout
funds, reported a 34 percent increase in Chief Executive Officer
James Wells’s 2010 compensation.  Wells’s total $10.3 million included $4.5 million in pay to
be collected later, primarily boosted by the changing value of
his pension benefits, the bank said today in a regulatory filing.
He received $4.6 million in stock, more than three times as much
as the previous year, it said. His salary was unchanged at $1.1
million, and he didn’t get a cash bonus or stock options. The
bank reported a $3.3 million option award for 2009.  SunTrust, led by Wells since January of 2007, returned to
quarterly profits last year for the first time since 2008 as it
set aside less money to cover bad loans. The company may sell
stock to repay funds received under the $700 billion Troubled
Asset Relief Program, Wells, 64, told analysts last month.  He declined more than 552,900  stock options  that were
awarded for 2009, according to the filing. Had he accepted the
grant, his total compensation for 2010 would have fallen 37
percent from the year earlier, the Atlanta-based company said.  SunTrust climbed 0.2 percent to $30.62 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange Trading today. The shares have advanced 35
percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
