Namibia’s  central bank left its
benchmark interest rate unchanged after economic growth
accelerated and the inflation rate rose from a five-year low.  The repurchase rate stayed at 6 percent,  Bank of Namibia 
Governor Ipumbu Shiimi told reporters today in the capital,
Windhoek. The bank cut interest rates at the last two meetings
and the latest decision is in line with  South Africa ’s move to
leave its repo rate at 5.5 percent on Jan. 20.  The economy in Namibia, the world’s biggest miner of
offshore diamonds and the fourth-largest producer of uranium,
expanded about 4.2 percent last year, after a 0.7 percent
contraction in 2009, Shiimi said on Dec. 15. A slowdown in
growth in  Europe  is a threat to  Namibia ’s economy, he said.  Inflation accelerated to 3.5 percent in January from 3.1
percent a month earlier, which was the lowest rate since
December 2005.  Namibia’s currency is pegged to the South African rand and
the central bank generally follows monetary policy set by the
South African Reserve Bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
