The Korea Feed Association,  South
Korea â€™s biggest grain-buying group, purchased 45,000 metric tons
of soybean meal in a tender today, according to two industry
executives with direct knowledge of the bidding.  The group bought the cargo from Concordia Agritrading Pte
at $433.87 a ton on a cost-and-freight basis, the executives
said, asking not to be identified because tender results are
confidential. The shipment is due for arrival by June 5 at the
port in Incheon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
