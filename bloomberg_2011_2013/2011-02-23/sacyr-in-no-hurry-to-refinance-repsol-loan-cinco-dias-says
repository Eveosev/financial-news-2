  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA  is in “no
hurry” to refinance the 5 billion-euro ($6.9 billion) loan it
took out to purchase 20 percent of  Repsol YPF SA  in 2006,  Cinco
Dias  reported, citing Chairman Luis del Rivero.  Rivero, who was speaking at a conference in  Panama , said
that once Sacyr renegotiates the loan, which comes due at the
end of this year, it will have to pay more interest, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
