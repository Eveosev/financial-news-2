The French government will limit new
solar power projects to 500 megawatts a year,  Les Echos 
reported, citing Prime Minister Francois Fillon.  That limit may be raised to 800 megawatts in the future,

also plans to create a simplified tender system for solar
projects of between 100 and 250 kilowatts, according to Les
Echos.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
