  Jazztel Plc , a Spanish phone
company, posted fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates as sales surged, boosted by an increasing base of
broadband customers.  Net income was 4.8 million euros ($6.6 million), compared
with a net loss of 13.1 million euros a year earlier, the
company said in a statement today. Sales climbed 32 percent to
171.9 million euros, while earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization reached 29.3 million euros.
Jazztel’s base of broadband clients grew 45 percent in the year
to 865,745.  Jazztel, which has its main offices in Madrid, was expected
to earn 4.4 million euros on sales of 166.4 million euros and
Ebitda of 27.7 million euros, according to the average analyst
estimates from a Bloomberg survey. The company also exceeded its
own forecasts provided in March last year.  “Jazztel will continue to gain market share in  Spain ,”
Stephane Beyazian, a Paris-based analyst at  Raymond James , said
by phone before the results. “They need also to invest in the
network to expand its coverage and margins will continue to
improve over the next 12 months.”  The company has an 8 percent market share in broadband, it
said in the filing.  Full-year net income reached 7.2 million euros, the first
full-year profit in its history, which compares with a net loss
of 24.5 million euros in 2009.  Jazztel forecast Ebitda of 120 million to 130 million euros
this year, compared with 93.6 million euros last year. Net
income excluding one-time items will be in the range of 25
million to 35 million euros, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
