The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, which has fostered the building of market
economies in Eastern Europe in the past two decades, is
considering adding  Egypt  to the countries where it invests, EBRD
President Thomas Mirow said.  Egypt, a founding shareholder of the London-based lender,
filed a request in May to be included in the bank’s target
region, the ERBD spokesman, Anthony Williams, said today by
telephone. Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  was toppled Feb. 11
after anti-government protests.  “We will analyze Egypt’s commitment to democracy and the
market economy -- values promoted by the EBRD’s statutes,”
Mirow will say today at Oxford University, according to the text
of a speech distributed by the EBRD’s press office. “Now, that
examination is proceeding apace.”  An initial report will be prepared in coming months and
considered by the board of directors. A final decision will have
to be made by the bank’s shareholders, Mirow said.  The EBRD, owned by 61 countries and two intergovernmental
institutions, was created in 1991 to invest in former communist
countries to help them transform their economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
