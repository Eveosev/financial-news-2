Virgin Group Ltd is considering
starting an e-mailed “daily deals” service to offer limited-
time discounts on products from Virgin and other companies, the
Financial Times reported, citing an unidentified investor with
knowledge of the proposal.  A group of entrepreneurs raised the idea with the company
last year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
