The New Zealand dollar rose after
Moody’s Investors Service said it saw no immediate impact on the
nation’s credit rating following yesterday’s earthquake in
Christchurch.  The so-called kiwi rose 0.4 percent to 74.96 U.S. cents as
of 1:32 p.m. in Wellington, paring yesterday’s 2.3 percent
plunge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
