Spot gasoline in New York
strengthened to futures as earnings increased for tankers used
to import the fuel during the U.S. refinery maintenance season.  “A recent rise in fixture activity for gasoline shipments
to the U.S. from  Europe , ahead of refiners emerging from
seasonal maintenance periods, has seen tanker earnings on this
route rise by 48 percent from last week,” George Los, an
analyst at Charles R. Weber Co., a Greenwich, Connecticut-based
shipbroker, said in an e-mail.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 0.12 cent to 1.63 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:18
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It is the highest
level at the hub since Feb. 9. Prompt delivery rose 11.79 cents
to $2.7025.  Utilization is likely to rise as refiners emerge from
maintenance, boosting rates for shippers to take distillate from
the U.S.  Gulf Coast  to Europe, Los said.  Refinery utilization is forecast to rise 0.5 percentage
point, according to a median of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Total U.S. refinery use dropped 3.5 percentage points to
81.2 percent in the period ending Feb. 11, according to the
Energy Department, the lowest level since March.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf Coast
strengthened 0.18 cent to 2.63 cents a gallon versus futures.
Prompt delivery rose 12.4 cents to $2.9409.  “I see imports into the East Coast continuing and exports
out of the Gulf Coast continuing as well,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline imports to the East Coast rose 40,000 barrels a
day to 883,000 barrels in the week ended Feb. 11, according to
the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
