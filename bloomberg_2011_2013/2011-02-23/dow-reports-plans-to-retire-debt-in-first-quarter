  Dow Chemical Co ., the largest U.S.
chemical maker, plans to use cash to repay more than $1.5
billion of debt during the first quarter to reduce interest
payments.  Dow started a cash tender offer for four notes with an
aggregate principal of about $750 million, the Midland,
Michigan-based company said today in a statement. It’s also
paying off $800 million of matured debt and more than $150
million of so-called InterNotes in the quarter, Dow said.  The results of the tender won’t be known until next month,
Rebecca Bentley, a Dow spokeswoman, said by telephone. The debt
reduction will cut interest payments by $120 million to $130
million a year starting in the second quarter, she said.  Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris said Feb. 3 he plans
to reduce cash and cash equivalents to as little as $2 billion
this year from $7 billion on Dec. 31 by repaying debt,
increasing shareholder payouts and funding expansion projects.
Dow’s fourth-quarter net income almost tripled to $511 million,
beating analysts’ estimates on higher prices for products
including plastics and caustic soda, as sales in emerging
markets climbed to a record.  The notes Dow is buying via the tender have $5.33 billion
of outstanding principal with coupons ranging from 7.75 percent
to 9.4 percent, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
