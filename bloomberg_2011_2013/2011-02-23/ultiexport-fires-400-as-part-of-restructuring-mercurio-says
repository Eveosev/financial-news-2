  Multiexport Foods SA ,  Chile ’s
largest listed salmon exporter, has fired 400 workers as part of
a restructuring process of its operating divisions, El Mercurio
wrote.  The restructuring process will separate Multiexport’s
salmon farming operations under the unit Salmones Multiexport
SA, while another unit, to be called Alimentos Multiexport SA,
will be in charge of other product lines such as smoked foods,
the Santiago-based newspaper wrote, citing Chief Executive
Officer Andres Lyon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
