Yeochun NCC Co.,  South Korea â€™s
biggest ethylene producer, aims to resume operations at a
naphtha cracker today that was shut following a power outage, a
company official said.  The No. 1 plant in Yeosu, south of  Seoul , which is able to
make 857,000 metric tons of ethylene a year from naphtha, was
halted yesterday, according to the official, who declined to be
identified because of corporate policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
