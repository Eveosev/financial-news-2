(Corrects headline to add billion to earnings total.)  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
says U.S. banks had net income of $21.7 billion in the fourth
quarter, boosting earnings for the full year to $87.5 billion,
the highest since 2007.  Even as industrywide earnings reached their highest level
since before the 2008 credit crisis, the number of institutions
on the FDIC’s confidential “troubled” bank list rose to 884
from 860 in the preceding quarter, the agency said today in its
Quarterly Banking Profile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
