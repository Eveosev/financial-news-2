Malaysia’s ringgit weakened for a
third day as political turmoil in the Middle East prompted
investors to favor safer bets than emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional stocks fell to its
lowest level in more than a week after Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  vowed to fight a growing rebellion until his “last drop
of blood” and pledged to deploy the army and police to impose
order. Consumer prices climbed 2.4 percent in January from a
year earlier, the most since May 2009, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the
data due today. Prices rose 2.2 percent in December.  “Investors are taking a look at the Middle East situation
carefully,” said Tetsuo Yoshikoshi, a Singapore-based senior
economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “The inflation rate
is expected to be higher but it may not be a major concern as it
is still low in the region.”  The ringgit declined 0.1 percent to 3.0464 per dollar as of
4:29 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 3.0240 on Feb. 21, the strongest level
since October 1997.  Qaddafi’s crackdown, which has followed the ouster of
leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt  and protests in Bahrain and Yemen,
has already left almost 300 dead, according to  Human Rights
Watch .  Ten-year notes fell. The yield on 4.16 percent bond due
July 2021 rose two basis points to 4.08 percent, according to
Bursa Malaysia. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
