  Pakistan ’s large-scale manufacturing
sector output expanded 2.96 percent in December, according to
the Federal Bureau of Statistics.  Manufacturing sector output contracted 1.57 percent during
first six months of the financial year that started July 1,
according to data posted on the  website  of the Islamabad-based
statistics agency.  Pakistan is seeking to improve industrial output and boost
exports to sustain growth in a country where the  World Bank
