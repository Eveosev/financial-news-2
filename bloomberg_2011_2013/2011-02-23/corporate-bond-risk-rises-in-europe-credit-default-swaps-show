The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 9 basis
points to 400, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 3 p.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose for a fifth day, increasing 1.75
basis points to 101.75. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers fell 0.25 basis points to 165 and the
subordinated index was 8 higher at 284 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
