Turkish stocks slumped to their
lowest in more than five months and the country’s bonds and
currency declined on concern violence in  Libya  and rising oil
prices will widen the current-account deficit and hurt earnings.  The  ISE National 100 Index  of stocks fell 2.4 percent to
63,131.68 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul, its lowest since
Sept. 14. Yields on two-year bonds climbed 17 basis points to
8.70 percent, the highest since June, according to the RBS
Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index. The lira weakened 0.4 percent to
1.6045 per dollar.    Turkey  is a net oil importer and a $10 rise in oil prices
will widen the current-account deficit by $2 billion,” Nezihi Abay, head of trading at Global Securities in Istanbul, said by
telephone.  Oil approached $100 a barrel in  New York  as Libya’s
uprising threatened exports. The ratio of Turkey’s current-
account deficit to gross domestic product rises 0.6 percentage
points with a $10 increase in crude oil prices, creating an
“important risk,” Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said in
Ankara today. Deputy Prime Minister  Ali Babacan  said this week
the widening current-account deficit means there’s “no room for
error” in managing the economy.  Abay said he expects the deficit to reach $61 billion this
year, up from $48.6 billion in 2010.  Contracts  Turkish companies have $15.3 billion in Libyan contracts,
Trade Minister Zafer Caglayan said at a news conference in
Ankara on Feb. 21. Exports to the Middle East and North Africa
constituted 26 percent of total Turkish exports last year,
according to the Turkish Statistics Institute.  Rising oil prices and the loss of contracts in Libya may
hurt company earnings, except for those of oil refiner  Tupras
Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS , said Abay. Tupras rose 0.3
percent to 40.40 liras today.  “The unrest in Libya is accelerating the deterioration in
our market,” Burak Demircioglu, a trader at EFG Istanbul
Securities, said in e-mailed comments.    Akfen Holding AS , with interests in construction, real
estate, tourism and energy, fell 10 kurus, or 0.9 percent, to
10.90 liras as the company evacuated employees from its two
airport terminal projects in Libya. Akfen’s unit Tav Insaat has
25 percent share in a contract to build a new terminal at
Tripoli airport and 50 percent in a similar contract for Sebha
airport, Akfen said in a statement to the Istanbul Stock
Exchange today.  Turkish Airlines    TAV Havalimanlari Holding AS , Turkey’s biggest airport
operator, in which Akfen has a 26 percent stake, dropped 28
kurus, or 4.1 percent, to 6.48 liras, its lowest since Aug. 5.    Turk Hava Yollari  AO, or Turkish Airlines, the national
carrier, dropped 26 kurus, or 5.5 percent, to 4.44 liras as oil
prices increased.  Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi vowed to keep fighting the
rebellion in the country, Africa’s third-biggest oil supplier,
in a crackdown that Human Rights Watch says has left almost 300
people dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
