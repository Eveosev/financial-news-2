Brookfield Renewable Power Inc., a
Toronto-based developer, hired RMT Inc. to build a 99-megawatt
wind farm in  New Hampshire .  The Granite Reliable project in Coos County will be the
state’s largest wind farm and is expected to be complete by the
end of the year, Brookfield said today in a statement. Terms of
the contract weren’t disclosed.  Brookfield bought a 75 percent stake in the project from
Essex, Connecticut-based wind energy developer Noble
Environmental Power Inc. in December. Freshet Wind Energy LLC
owns the remainder.  RMT, a Madison, Wisconsin-based engineering and
construction company, began clearing the site Feb. 12. The wind
farm will have 33  wind turbines  from Vestas Wind Systems A/S,
each with capacity of 3.0 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
