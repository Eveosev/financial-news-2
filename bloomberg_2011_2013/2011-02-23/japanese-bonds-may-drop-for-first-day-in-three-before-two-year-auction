Japanese bonds gained for a third
day as violence in  Libya  pushed up crude  oil prices , fueling
speculation global economic growth will slow.  Ten-year yields dropped to the lowest level in three weeks
after crude climbed to $100 a barrel in  New York  yesterday for
the first time in two years, spurring demand for the safety of
debt. Bonds also climbed after demand for safe-haven currencies
boosted the yen against most of its 16 major counterparts,
triggering a slump in domestic stocks.  “Investors started shifting focus to the negative aspect
of surging oil prices and that it will cause the deterioration
of economic activity,” said Tadashi Matsukawa, fixed-income
head at PineBridge Investments Japan Co. in Tokyo, which manages
the equivalent of $2.1 billion in bonds. “This seems to be a
factor that’s giving some support to long-term bonds.”  The 10-year yield fell two basis points to 1.225 percent as
of 3:35 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.2 percent security
maturing in December 2020 rose 0.175 yen to 99.781 yen.  The yield earlier reached 1.22 percent, the lowest level
since Feb. 2. The three-day gain in 10-year bonds was the
longest winning streak since Jan. 12.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery advanced 0.09 to
139.79 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Two-year yields were unchanged at 0.22 percent after a 2.6
trillion-yen ($31.7 billion) auction of the securities today
drew bids valued at 3.7 times the amount on offer, down from a
so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 5.33 in January.  Flight to Safety  Oil surged in  London  to the highest in almost 30 months on
concern unrest in the Middle East will disrupt supplies.
Loyalists of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  sought to crush
dissent in Tripoli as his opponents tightened control of eastern
cities. Libya is Africa’s third-biggest oil producer.  The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average sank 1.2 percent as the yen
gained to 81.98 per dollar, the strongest since Feb. 8. A higher
yen decreases the value of overseas sales at Japanese companies.  “The stock market is weak with heightening tension in the
Middle East,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist in Tokyo at
Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which manages about $331 billion
in investments. “Risk aversion is dominating the market, and
money is flowing into the  bond market .”  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, one of the 24 primary
dealers obliged to bid at Japan’s debt sales, recommends buying
shorter-term securities once the yield spread between two-year
notes and 10-year debt narrows to less than 100 basis points.
The yield gap was at 100.5 basis points today.  “It is important to be aware of 100 basis points as a key
threshold for the 2-year to 10-year spread,”  Akito Fukunaga ,
chief rates strategist in Tokyo at Royal Bank of Scotland’s
brokerage unit, wrote in a note today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
