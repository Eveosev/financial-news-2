John Williams, research director at
the Federal Reserve Bank of  San Francisco , said that while
monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative for some time,
policy makers will reverse course at the appropriate time.  “I want to emphasize that, when the right time comes, the
Fed will reduce monetary stimulus,” Williams said in the text
of a speech today in San Francisco.  Williams reiterated the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s
pledge to keep an accommodative policy in place for an
“extended period,” saying that it will take “quite some
time” before unemployment falls to a level that pushes
inflation too high based on the San Francisco Fed’s forecasts.
He added that “even the best forecasts can be wrong.”  “A great deal of thought has gone into designing the
proper ways to unwind the measures now in place,” Williams said
in a speech to the Chicago Booth Graduate School of Business
Alumni Club of San Francisco. “I’m confident we’ll be able to
do so successfully and maintain  price stability .”  The San Francisco Fed has been without a president since
last year, when Janet Yellen joined the Fed board in  Washington 
as its vice chairman. Williams has given speeches on behalf of
the San Francisco Fed while the search for Yellen’s successor is
under way.  To contact the reporter on this story:
