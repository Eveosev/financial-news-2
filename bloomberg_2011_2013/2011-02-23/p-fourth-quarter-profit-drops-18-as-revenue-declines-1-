  MLP AG ,  Germany ’s third-biggest
financial-services broker, said fourth-quarter profit fell 18
percent as it earned less from selling retirement products.  Net income declined to 21.6 million euros ($29.6 million)
in the three months ended December from 26.5 million euros in
the year-earlier period, the Wiesloch, Germany-based company
said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  MLP, led by Chief Executive Officer Uwe Schroeder-Wildberg,
reiterated a target to raise earnings before interest and tax to
15 percent of sales in 2012 from 9 percent in 2010. Revenue
dropped 7 percent to 173.7 million euros in the fourth quarter.
The number of consultants, an indicator for future earnings,
fell to 2,273 from 2,317 at the end of September.  Sales at financial-services brokers are “being influenced
by discussions about inflation and the reduction in the
guaranteed yield for  life insurance  and private pension
policies,” the company said in the statement.  The broker, whose shares have gained 14 percent over the
past year, plans to increase its dividend payout for 2010 to 30
cents a share from 25 cents distributed for 2009. Full-year
profit rose 41 percent to 34.1 million euros, it said.  The company cut its fixed expenses by 16.4 million euros in
2010, exceeding its target for cost reductions of 10 million
euros, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
