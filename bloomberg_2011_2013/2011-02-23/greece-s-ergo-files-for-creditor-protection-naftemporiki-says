Ergo 3 , a Greek construction
company, filed for protection from creditors as it seeks to
reorganize some operations and expand business in  Azerbaijan ,
 Naftemporiki  reported.  Ergo plans to sell some assets, including real-estate
developments in  Georgia  and a 33 percent stake in an underground
parking management company in  Greece , to repay lenders, the
newspaper said, without indicating where it got the information
from. The company has 18 million euros ($25 million) in debt,
the newspaper added.  Ergo plans a joint venture with a local partner in
Azerbaijan to enter the construction and technology services
markets, Naftemporiki said, citing Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Angelos Sismanopoulos.  Officials at the company’s headquarters in Thessaloniki
weren’t immediately available for comment in response to a phone
call by Bloomberg News.  For Related News and Information:
