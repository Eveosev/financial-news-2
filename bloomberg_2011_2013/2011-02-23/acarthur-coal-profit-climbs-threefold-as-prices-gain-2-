  Macarthur Coal Ltd ., the world’s
biggest producer of pulverized coal, said half-year profit rose
more than threefold as coal prices gained.  Net income was A$141.3 million ($141.4 million), or 50
cents a share, compared with A$39.7 million, or 16 cents, the
Brisbane-based company said in a statement. This compares with
an earlier forecast of A$138 million to A$143 million.    Australia  had its wettest September-to-November spring on
record, with heavy rain and flooding across Queensland and New
South Wales cutting output and driving up cash prices for both
thermal and steelmaking coal. Macarthur declared force majeure
on Dec. 3, a clause that allows companies to miss deliveries
because of circumstances beyond their control.  “Demand remained robust through the half year and
metallurgical coal accounted for 95 percent of coal sold during
the period,” Chief Executive Officer Nicole Hollows said in the
statement.  Macarthur gained 0.8 percent to A$12.03 at the 4:10 p.m.
close on the Australian stock exchange. Its sales rose 32
percent to A$420.4 million, it said.  Production for the financial year ending June 30 will be
between 4.1 million metric ton to 4.3 million tons, down from 5
million tons because of the rains, Macarthur said Feb. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
