  Air Mauritius Ltd . fell the most in
more than five months as oil rose to a more than two-year high
after Libya’s uprising threatened to disrupt exports and spread
to other nations in the Middle East.  The stock of sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth-largest airline
retreated the most since Sept. 9, losing 0.8 rupee, or 3.9
percent, to 19.7 by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis.  Crude for April delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent to
$96.25 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  after Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi vowed to fight a
growing rebellion until his “last drop of blood.” Libya is
Africa’s third-largest supplier of crude.  “The soaring petrol price is non-negligible on Air
Mauritius’s finances,” Kishen Nadassen, senior research analyst
at CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a phone interview from  Port
Louis . “We could expect the company to adjust upwards its fuel
surcharges in order to compensate for the increase in the
costs.”  The company’s fuel expenses increased by 24.5 million euros
($34 million) in the nine months through December, it said in a
 statement  on Feb. 10.
