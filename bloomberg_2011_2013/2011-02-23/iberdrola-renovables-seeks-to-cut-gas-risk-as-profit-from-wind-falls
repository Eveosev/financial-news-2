  Iberdrola Renovables SA  Chief
Executive Xavier Viteri said he’s looking for ways to reduce
exposure to the U.S. after losses on the company’s natural gas
inventory dragged down 2010 profit.  The world’s biggest producer of clean energy posted net
income of 360 million euros ($495 million) for 2010 compared
with 371 million euros in the previous year after it suffered a
35 million-euro loss on its U.S. gas holdings, according to a
regulatory filing.  “We are facing a situation with stagnant gas demand and a
great production of shale gas,” Viteri said on a conference
call with investors today. The company is looking at a “wide
range” of options to “reduce the risk and volatility.”  The price of natural gas fell 21 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  last year as the supply of the fuel from
U.S. shale fields rose. Renovables operates gas storage and
trading units in the U.S. alongside its main business generating
power from wind farms.  The company plans to add 1.4 gigawatts to 1.5 gigawatts of
new generating capacity this year, Viteri said. The price per
megawatt for wind has fallen by about 10 percent since 2009,
Chief Financial Officer Jose Angel Marra said on the call. He
said the cost of wind power has fallen more than the turbine
price because newer machines need less maintenance.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization at the gas unit slumped 96 percent last year to 6
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
