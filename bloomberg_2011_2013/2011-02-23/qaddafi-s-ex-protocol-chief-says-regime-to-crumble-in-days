  Muammar Qaddafi  will fight to the
end, though it’s just a “matter of days” before his regime
crumbles, the Libyan leader’s former chief of protocol said in
an interview on French television.  Army units in Benghazi and Tobruk have defected, allowing
the opposition to control the two main cities in the east of the
country, Nuri al-Mismari said on Canal+ television.  “He’ll hold on right to the end,” al-Mismari said. “He
threatens to use massive force. He’s already used planes, tanks,
mercenaries. What’s left? Chemical weapons?”  Qaddafi vowed in a television address yesterday to fight
the rebellion until his “last drop of blood.” Qaddafi’s
crackdown on the week-long demonstrations has already
left almost 300 dead, according to  Human Rights Watch , and
driven  oil prices  to a 2 1/2-year high.  “He’s nervous, he’s not in good health,” Al-Mismari said.
“These acts are not of someone who is lucid.”  Libya unsuccessfully sought al-Mismari’s extradition from
France last November, accusing him of embezzlement when he
didn’t return home after visiting  France  for medical treatment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
