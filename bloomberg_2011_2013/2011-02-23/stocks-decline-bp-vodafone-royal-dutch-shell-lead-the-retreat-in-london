U.K. stocks dropped for a fourth
day, the longest losing streak for the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index 
since August, as oil surged to a 28-month high after Libyan
leader Muammar Qaddafi vowed to fight a growing rebellion.  Mining companies  BHP Billiton Ltd . and  Antofagasta Plc  led
declines in the FTSE 100 as nine shares fell for each one that
rose.  Logica Plc  dropped 5.4 percent as full-year profit at the
Anglo-Dutch computer services provider missed analyst estimates.  The FTSE 100 retreated 73.23, or 1.2 percent, to 5,923.53
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the biggest drop this month.
The four-day slide has pared this year’s advance to 0.4 percent
amid speculation political instability in the Middle East will
cause higher inflation, weakening the economic recovery and
curbing earnings. The  FTSE All-Share Index  lost 1.2 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slipped 0.3 percent.  “The rise in oil prices could tip the economy into a
significant period of sub-par growth,” Gerard Lane, an equity
strategist at Shore Capital Group Ltd. in Liverpool, England,
wrote in a report today. “We find ourselves less convinced
about the robustness of the  U.S. economy , and as such suggest
that the equity market may suffer weakness, as it did in the
second quarter in 2010.”  Libya Protests  Governments rushed to evacuate thousands of expatriates
from Libya as army units defected and a former aide to Qaddafi
warned that the revolt may topple the regime within days. The
holder of  Africa ’s largest oil reserves is the latest nation to
be rocked by protests ignited by last month’s ouster of
Tunisia’s president and fanned by the Feb. 11 fall of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.    Bank of England  policy maker Spencer Dale joined Andrew Sentance and Martin Weale in voting for an interest-rate
increase this month as a split widened on the dangers of
inflation at double their target, according to minutes of the
Feb. 10 decision published today.  “Equity markets may be negatively affected as the
likelihood of at least three quarter-point rate rises this year
becomes more firmly priced-in,” said James Stewart, an
economist at North Square Blue Oak in  London . “It is also
supportive of sterling, which feeds into equities as it makes
life more difficult for export-oriented companies.”  The pound strengthened against the dollar and the euro
after the release of the BOE’s minutes.  BHP, Antofagasta  BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, lost 3.1
percent to 2,337.5 pence and Antofagasta sank 5.1 percent to
1,313 pence. Copper fell to a four-week low on speculation that
unrest in North Africa and the Middle East will derail
recovering economies as oil prices jump.  Logica sank 5.4 percent to 137.5 pence, the biggest decline
since July. Pretax profit more than quadrupled to 193 million
pounds ($313 million) in 2010, missing the average analyst
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 240 million pounds.    Rexam Plc  slid 5.8 percent to 348.4 pence even after the
world’s biggest beverage-can maker reported full-year net income
of 124 million pounds, compared with a net loss of 29 million
pounds a year earlier. The stock had rallied 11 percent this
year before today’s slump.    Cable & Wireless Communications Plc  rallied 6.2 percent to
49.33 pence, the biggest gain since 2008, after agreeing to sell
its operating business in Bermuda for $70 million and saying it
will buy back up to $100 million of shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
