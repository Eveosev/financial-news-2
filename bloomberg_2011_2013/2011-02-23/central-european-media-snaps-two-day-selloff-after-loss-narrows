  Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd . jumped the most in more than four months after saying its
fourth-quarter revenue rose and loss narrowed as advertisers
increased spending.  The broadcaster jumped 5.6 percent to 352.1 koruna at 4:24
p.m. in Prague, its biggest increase in Czech trading since Oct.
11. In the U.S., the stock rallied as much as 12 percent, and
traded up 8.3 percent to $19.45 at 11:23 a.m. in  New York .  Net loss for the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to $26.1
million from $55.3 million a year earlier, the Bermuda-based
company part-owned by Time Warner Inc. said in a statement
today. Revenue rose $23 million to $257.4 million.  “Fourth-quarter revenue was a positive surprise and is
good news because it provides hope that the operating
performance will keep improving this year,” Josef Nemy, an
analyst at Komercni Banka AS in  Prague , wrote in a report to
clients today.  Komercni, the Czech unit of Societe Generale SA, has a
“hold” recommendation for CME shares with a 12-month price
estimate of $26, according to Nemy’s report. “CME shares are
without doubt a risky investment, but we believe that they are
currently undervalued,” Nemy wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
