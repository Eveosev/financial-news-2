Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
phone unit of Deutsche Telekom AG, may report a fourth-quarter
loss after a special industry tax levied by the government to
plug budget holes eliminated profit.  The loss may reach 9.9 billion forint ($50 million) after a
profit of 10.2 billion forint a year earlier, according to the
average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
estimates were from a loss of 7.9 billion forint to a loss of
14.2 billion forint. The company is scheduled to publish
earnings tomorrow in Budapest.  Magyar Telekom Chief Executive Officer Christopher Mattheisen has proposed cutting the 2010 dividend to 50 forint
per share from 74 forint in 2009 because of the industry tax.
The company expects to pay an extra 27 billion forint annually
in taxes through 2012, Mattheisen said on Nov. 4.  The following table shows the estimates and the year-
earlier results. The figures are in billions of forint.  To contact the reporters on this story:
