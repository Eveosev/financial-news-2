  Iran  plans to attract a total $11
billion of investment in its South Pars natural gas field by
March 20, the end of the Iranian calendar year, Pars Oil and Gas
Co. managing director Mousa Souri said, without specifying where
the investment would come from.  The field has already drawn an investment of $9 billion,
Souri said in a report published on the Oil Ministry’s news
website,  Shana , late yesterday.  Iran needs $40 billion to develop all 28 phases of the
South Pars gas field over a period of 10 years, the Oil Ministry
said in November 2009.  Iran’s plan to develop South Pars, the world’s largest
single gas deposit which the Persian Gulf country shares with
Qatar, have been delayed by international economic sanctions
over its nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
