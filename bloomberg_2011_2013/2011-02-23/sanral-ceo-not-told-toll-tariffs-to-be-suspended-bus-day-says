South African National Roads Agency
Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Nazir Ali wasn’t told that the
government will suspend tariffs gazetted for toll roads around
Johannesburg and  Pretoria , Business Day said, citing Ali.  Sanral was planning to offer a new bond on March 2 to fund
its toll road operations, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.
The company has a three-month “liquidity buffer,” which will
give it room to continue operating without the need to raise
more funding, Ali was cited by Business Day as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
