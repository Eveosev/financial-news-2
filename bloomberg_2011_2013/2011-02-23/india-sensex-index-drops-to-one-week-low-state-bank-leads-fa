Indian stocks dropped to a one-week
low, led by lenders, after the central bank said an adviser
favored higher  interest rates .    State Bank of India , the biggest lender, fell the most in
five weeks. A member of an advisory panel on monetary policy
recommended last month that the repurchase rate be raised by
half a percentage point instead of one quarter, to slow
inflation, the  Reserve Bank of India ’s minutes of a Jan. 19
meeting showed yesterday.  ICICI Bank Ltd ., the second-biggest,
declined for the second day.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
lost 125.59, or 0.7 percent, to 18,170.57, according to
preliminary closing prices at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The

percent to 5,437.35. The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.6 percent to
