  Assicurazioni Generali SpA ,  Italy ’s
biggest insurer, said most of the company’s equity investments
aren’t strategic and are managed by its chief executive officer.  “None of the company’s equity investments can be considered
a strategic shareholding, with the exception of those that
involve industrial relationships,” Trieste, Italy-based
Generali said in a statement distributed by the Italian
Exchange. The CEO will manage them with a view to creating value
for all shareholders, Generali said.  Generali Chairman Cesare Geronzi said in an interview with
the Financial Times on Feb. 16 that the company may consider
investing in Italian banks, comments that contrasted with the
insurer’s position outlined in a business plan presented in
November. Luxottica Group SpA founder Leonardo Del Vecchio
resigned as a Generali director Feb. 21, saying he wasn’t able
to influence strategy at the insurer.  The resignation won’t have any “negative consequences on
the effectiveness and efficiency of current governance,” the
company said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
