President  Barack Obama  is reviewing
options, including sanctions, to pressure Libyan authorities to
halt their violent response to a spreading rebellion, White
House press secretary Jay Carney said.  Obama is scheduled to deliver a statement on Libya at 5:15
p.m. Washington time.  “We are reviewing a variety of options with our
international partners to compel or to persuade the government
of Libya to cease this terrible violence,” he said. The U.S.
will look at coordinated action with other governments as well
as unilateral steps, he said, refusing to elaborate.  At the State Department, spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  said
among the potential steps the U.S. might consider are freezing
the assets of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  “Everything will be on the table,” Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said at a news conference today.  Obama’s statement follows a scheduled meeting with Clinton.
Obama hasn’t spoken publicly about the situation in Libya, where
some members of Qaddafi’s government have defected and his
loyalists have been battling protesters with gunfire. About 300
people have been killed, according to New York-based Human
Rights Watch.  Evacuations  The administration is continuing to work on evacuating U.S.
citizens and personnel from Libya. The U.S. embassy in Tripoli
 announced  yesterday that a government-chartered ferry would take
American citizens from the Libyan capital to Malta.  Carney repeated his statement that the administration is
monitoring oil markets for any effect on prices from the unrest
in Libya, holder of the biggest proven reserves in  Africa . He
didn’t elaborate.  “We are monitoring oil prices very carefully, but I
wouldn’t speculate about where those prices will go in the
future,” he said.  Oil touched $100 a barrel in  New York  for the first time
since October 2008, on concern that the uprising threatened to
halt Libyan exports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
