Ghana ’s producer-price inflation
rate rose the most in a year as a fuel-price increase boosted
costs for manufacturers in the West African nation.  Inflation in January accelerated to 23.1 percent from a
revised 17.8 percent in December, Ebo Duncan, a statistician at
the  Ghana  Statistical Service, told reporters in the capital,
Accra, today. That’s the highest since reaching 26.3 percent in
January 2010.  “The 30 percent increase in petrol prices in January was
received by manufacturers as a direct cost,” Duncan said.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 70 percent of the index, rose
11.4 percent in January from 5.4 percent the month before, he
said.  Ghana raised its fuel prices in step with higher global
costs for oil, a move that accelerated consumer-price inflation
for the first time 19 months in January. The rate climbed to 9.1
percent, from 8.6 percent a month earlier, the statistical
service said Feb. 9.  “The oil price has significantly spiked higher now, meaning
further increases in domestic fuel price look inevitable,” said  Razia Khan , London-based head of Africa research at  Standard
Chartered Plc , in an e-mailed note today.  Mining and quarrying costs, which make up 14 percent of the
index, rose 26 percent from 25.3 percent in December while the
cost of utilities was unchanged.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
