Lithuanian wages grew in the fourth
quarter from the previous three months, driven by year-end
bonuses in the public sector.  The average monthly gross wage increased 1.9 percent to
2,121 litas ($843), the Vilnius-based statistics  office  said in
an e-mailed statement today. Wages rose 0.2 percent from the
same period last year, marking the first annual increase in two
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
