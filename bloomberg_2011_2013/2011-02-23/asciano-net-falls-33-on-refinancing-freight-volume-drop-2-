  Asciano Ltd ., Australia’s largest
port operator, posted a 33 percent drop in first-half profit on
one-time charges related to debt refinancing and as Queensland
state floods disrupted shipments and damped volume.  Net income fell to A$126 million ($126 million), or 4.3
cents a share, in the six months ended Dec. 31, from A$188.2
million, or 7 cents, a year earlier, Melbourne-based Asciano
said in a statement today. Profit excluding items rose 48
percent.  Asciano’s Pacific National Pty. rail unit added contracts
with a venture of Macarthur Coal Ltd. and Noble Group Ltd. and
with Anglo American Plc, helping earnings before interest and
tax from coal surge 42 percent to A$83.9 million. November
floods in Queensland state,  Australia ’s biggest exporter of the
mineral, curbed growth in volumes from new contracts as mines
halted delivery.  “Weather impacts are expected to continue in Queensland
until March,” Asciano said in the statement. Effects of the
wettest September-November on record in the state “could impact
the full-year performance,” the statement said.  The port operator booked a one-time charge of A$29.6
million in the period to refinance debt, including the repayment
of A$1 billion of bank facilities in September.  Asciano shares rose 1.2 percent to A$1.735 at the 4:10 p.m.
market close in Sydney and have gained 8.8 percent this year,
compared with a 2.1 percent increase in the benchmark S&P/ASX
200 index.  The intermodal unit, which includes container freight,
posted a 14 percent drop in profit to A$65.4 million as weaker  consumer spending  led to lower volumes before Christmas and
steel shipments fell, it said.  Container port earnings rose 17 percent to A$79.8 million
as cost cuts limited the effect of a decline in shipping volume,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
