  Transgene SA  fell the most in more
than a decade in Paris trading after  Roche Holding AG  ended an
agreement to license the rights to the French company’s
experimental vaccine for cervical lesions.  Transgene dropped 2.80 euros, or 19 percent, to 12 euros in
Paris, giving the company a market value of about 380 million
euros ($523 million). It was the stock’s biggest decline since
the company’s initial public offering in March 1998.  The vaccine, known as TG4001/RG3484, is in the second of
three stages of clinical trials generally needed for regulatory
approval, Illkirch, France-based Transgene said in a statement
yesterday.  Roche ended the agreement because of “its own strategic
reasons,” and not because of data about the drug, Transgene
said. Patient enrollment for the trial is almost completed, and
interim data are expected by the end of this year or in early
2012, the company said. Transgene plans to seek a partner to
help develop TG4001 if the trial results are positive, the
company said.  The vaccine aims to treat the lesions caused by infection
with the human papilloma virus, which may lead to cervical
cancer. Transgene’s largest shareholder, with a 39 percent
stake, is  France ’s Merieux family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
