  Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd ., the east European broadcaster partly owned by Time Warner
Inc., said its fourth-quarter loss narrowed after restructuring
and as advertisers increased spending in certain markets.  The net loss for the three months ended Dec. 31 dropped to
$26.1 million from $55.3 million a year earlier, the Hamilton,
Bermuda based broadcaster said in a statement today. Revenue
rose $23 million to $257.4 million.  Sales and Oibda, or operating income before depreciation
and amortization, increased as a “result of the restructuring
of our broadcasting business and the start of recovery in
certain markets”, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Sarbu said in
the statement.  Central European Media, or CME, as the company is known,
has battled a slower-than-expected pickup in advertising in its
markets as their economies start to move out of recession. The
company said yesterday most markets showed signs of slight
recovery in the first quarter.  CME reported full year Oibda of $107.3 million, the company
said. The broadcaster said earlier that the measure would be
$100 million to $115 million.  CME operates TV channels in the  Czech Republic ,  Romania ,  Croatia , Slovakia, Slovenia and  Bulgaria . After dropping
unprofitable assets in Ukraine in 2010, the company agreed to
buy a Bulgarian station in February of last year.  Time Warner paid $241.5 million for a 31 percent stake in
CME in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
