  Ratio Oil Exploration 1992 LP  headed
for the highest close in two weeks as  Barclays Capital  said the
full potential of the Leviathan gas discovery isn’t priced into
shares of Israeli explorer.  The shares advanced 6.4 percent to 0.612 shekel, at 12:57
p.m. in  Tel Aviv , poised for the highest close since Feb. 9.  “Ratio is currently trading at a price that implies only
the value of drilling gas from Leviathan, which is then sold to
a third party distributor,” analyst David Kaplan wrote today in
an e-mailed report. “This scenario completely ignores the
potential for oil and participation in the export side of the
Leviathan business model.”  Drilling test results at the Leviathan field off Israel’s
coast confirm a “significant” find of at least 16 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas,  Noble Energy Inc ., the Houston-based
explorer with a controlling interest in Leviathan, said Dec. 29.  Middle East unrest is positive for the Israeli companies,
driving a government push to make the country fully energy
independent, Kaplan said. “Israel must guarantee energy
independence especially in light of the regional instability and
the economic implications,” Vice Prime Minister Silvan Shalom
said yesterday.  Kaplan has an “overweight” recommendation and 0.80 shekel
price estimate on Ratio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
