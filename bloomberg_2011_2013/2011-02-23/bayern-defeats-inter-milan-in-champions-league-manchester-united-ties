  Mario Gomez  scored in the 90th
minute to give Bayern Munich a 1-0 win over Inter Milan in their
Champions League round of 16 opener, while  Manchester United  and
Marseille drew 0-0.  Gomez put in the rebound after Inter goalkeeper Julio Cesar
was unable to hold onto Arjen Robben’s long shot at the San Siro
stadium in Milan. The meeting is a rematach of last season’s
Champions League final, won by Inter 2-0.  Bayern and Manchester United will host the return matches
in the two-game series on March 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
