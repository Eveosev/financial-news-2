A U.S. judge said he will approve a
bail package for Winifred Jiau, after saying the former
consultant to  Primary Global Research LLC  is a “flight risk”
because of ties to her native  Taiwan .  U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson said today he would
agree to release Jiau if she posts $50,000 cash and a parcel of
real estate worth an estimated $25,000 in addition to a total of
$500,000 assets to be posted by friends.  “I think that if the defendant puts up a sufficient amount
of cash in addition to the parcel of land that I would approve
the bail application,” Patterson said in a hearing today. “I
do think that there is a risk of flight and therefore there has
to be a bond.”  In the hearing, Jiau, 43, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy
and  securities-fraud  charges contained in a federal indictment
made public today. Jiau has been in custody since her arrest in
December on a criminal complaint with similar charges to those
contained in the indictment.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Avi Weitzman argued against bail
for Jiau, telling Patterson she is likely to flee to Taiwan,
which Weitzman said doesn’t have an extradition treaty with the
U.S. Jiau has family in Taiwan and none in the U.S., he said.
Jiau lived in that country until she was 23 and again from 2004
to 2005, according to Weitzman.  Prosecutors claim that from 2006 to 2008 Jiau passed inside
information to an unnamed hedge fund portfolio manager and to
Noah Freeman, the Boston hedge fund manager who pleaded guilty
Feb. 7 to securities fraud.  Jiau passed tips on  Nvidia Corp . and  Marvell Technology
Group Ltd . to the two men, according to the indictment. She was
paid as much as $10,000 a month in return. Weitzman told
Patterson today that Jiau received a total of $208,000 from
Primary Global in two years.  The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 10-mj-02900, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York    Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
