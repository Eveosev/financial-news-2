Several people have been injured
following what is thought to be an air gun shooting in
Auchinleck,  Scotland , said a spokeswoman for Strathclyde Police.  “Police were called to  Auchinleck Academy  after a report
of shooting,” said a spokeswoman for Strathclyde Police, who
declined to be named for policy reasons. “We believe it to be
an air gun. We have no idea of the number of injuries at this
stage, although apparently there are several. There would not
appear to be any serious injuries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
