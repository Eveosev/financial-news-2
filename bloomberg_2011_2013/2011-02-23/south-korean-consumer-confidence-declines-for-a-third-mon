South Korean  consumer confidence 
declined for a third month as people became more concerned about
the economy, job prospects and rising borrowing costs.  The sentiment index fell to 105 in February from 108 in
January, the  Bank of Korea  said in an e-mailed statement in
Seoul today. A number exceeding 100 indicates optimists
outnumber pessimists.  The Bank of  Korea  will keep raising interest rates at its
own pace, Governor Kim Choong Soo said after unexpectedly
leaving them unchanged this month. Higher borrowing costs may
add to the burdens of debt-bearing households and businesses
even as they help curb inflation.  A sub-index measuring views of the economic outlook fell to
94 in February from 97 in January, while a measure of job
opportunities dropped to 100 from 108. A sub-index on future
borrowing costs rose to 138 from 131 in January.  Kim’s policy board raised the benchmark interest rate by a
quarter percentage point in July, November and January from a
record-low 2 percent. Consumer prices jumped 4.1 percent in
January from a year earlier, exceeding the central bank’s target
of 2 percent to 4 percent through 2012.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,071 households in 56 cities and was conducted by mail and
telephone between Feb. 11 and Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
