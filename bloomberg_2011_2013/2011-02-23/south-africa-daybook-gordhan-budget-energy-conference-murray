South African Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  unveils his budget at about 2 p.m. in  Cape Town 
as  Africa ’s biggest economy ramps up spending to create jobs in
a country where one in four are without work.  The median estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
is for a budget deficit of 4.7 percent of gross domestic product
in the year beginning April 1, compared with Gordhan’s October
forecast of 4.6 percent. The shortfall will reach 5.4 percent
this fiscal year, compared with a previous forecast of 5.3
percent, and narrow to 4.1 percent in 2012-13, according to the
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
