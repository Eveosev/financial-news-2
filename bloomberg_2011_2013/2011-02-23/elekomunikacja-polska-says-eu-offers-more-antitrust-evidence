  Telekomunikacja Polska SA , Poland’s
largest phone company, said European Union antitrust regulators
asked it to respond to additional evidence that it refused to
give rivals access to wholesale broadband services.  Telekomunikacja, a unit of  France Telecom SA , said in its
annual report today the European Commission last month sent it a
formal list of evidence added to an existing antitrust complaint
made in March. The company said it must respond by March 7.  “Although the letter does not state additional objections
against TP SA, the commission still asserts that TP SA has
infringed the competition rules,” the company said.  EU antitrust regulators can fine companies as much as 10
percent of annual revenue for breaking competition rules.
Telekomunikacja said the EU could also impose a fine of an
additional 1 percent of revenue “for providing incorrect or
misleading information.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
