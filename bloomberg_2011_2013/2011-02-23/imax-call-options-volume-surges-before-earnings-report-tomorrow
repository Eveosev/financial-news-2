  Imax Corp . call-options volume
surged to a seven-week high before the operator of large-screen
movie theaters reports earnings tomorrow.  Most of the trading was concentrated in contracts that have
a strike price 9.3 percent higher than yesterday’s close.  More than 14,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands as of
3:47 p.m. in New York, almost 14 times the four-week average and
9 times the number of puts to sell. The most-traded contracts
were the March $30 calls, which accounted for more than half of
all call volume and gained 67 percent to $1. Mississauga,
Ontario-based Imax gained 1.2 percent to $27.77.  Imax will post profit of 21 cents a share excluding some
items, according to the average of 10 analysts’ estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. The company beat projections by 60 percent
when it reported third-quarter results excluding some items in
October. Shares rose 13 percent the day of the release. Imax has
more than doubled in the past year compared with a 51 percent
increase in the Bloomberg Hollywood Reporter Index, which tracks
large entertainment companies.  Imax’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices,
for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days jumped to 61.26
from 50.23 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
