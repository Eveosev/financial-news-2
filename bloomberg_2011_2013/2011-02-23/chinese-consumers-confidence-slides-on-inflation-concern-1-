A Chinese consumer confidence index
fell in the fourth quarter to the lowest since 2009, indicating
that concern about inflation may restrain spending in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy.  The measure was at 100, compared with 104 in the previous
three months, Nielsen Co. and the Chinese statistics bureau’s
Economic Monitoring and Analysis Center said in a statement
released in Beijing today.    China ’s inflation has topped the government’s 4 percent
target for 2011 for the past four months even as the central
bank raises  interest rates  and drains money from the financial
system by boosting lenders’ reserve requirements. Consumers’
willingness to spend dropped “notably” as inflation expectations
grew and food prices jumped, the statement said.  High housing prices and rising interest rates also curbed
private consumption, it said.  Eighty-three percent of consumers expected prices to rise
further in the next 12 months, 6 percentage points higher than
in the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
