  Accor SA ,  Europe ’s largest hotelier,
said it will accelerate an asset-disposal plan to cut adjusted
net debt by 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) this year and next.  The owner of the Novotel and Motel 6 brands will be able to
sell more than the 450 hotels it had planned to, it said today
in a statement. Accor, which seeks to operate or franchise most
of the properties it sells, had previously said disposals would
reduce net debt by 2 billion euros between 2010 and 2013. The
program lowered borrowings by 630 million euros last year.  Accor also said today that full-year earnings almost
doubled amid a recovery in business and leisure travel following
the 2009 global recession. Growth this year will come mainly
from increased occupancy at hotels, Chief Financial Officer
Sophie Stabile said on a conference call with reporters.  “Our objective will be to accelerate the execution of our
strategy,” Denis Hennequin, who was appointed chief executive
officer of Accor on Jan. 15, said in a  statement .  Accor fell 1.03 euros, or 2.9 percent, to 34.17 euros as of
9:51 a.m. in Paris trading. The stock has gained almost 50
percent since it started trading on July 2 in Paris as a
separate entity from  Edenred , the former voucher division.  “There seems to be no real change in strategy and the
outlook remains unchanged,” Matthias Desmarais, an analyst at
Exane BNP Paribas in Paris, said in a note to clients.  Rooms Rates Improving  Revenue per available room in the hotel industry rose
worldwide in 2010, according to London-based researcher STR
Global.  InterContinental Hotels Group Plc , the world’s largest
lodging company by number of rooms, this month reported a 38
percent jump in 2010 net income, led by  China .  Accor said average room rates are improving in upscale and
midscale hotels and “gradually stabilizing” at economy level.
The company reported “strong growth” in emerging markets.  Full-year earnings before interest and taxes rose to 446
million euros in 2010 from 235 million euros a year earlier. The
hotel operator estimated on Jan. 19 that Ebit was about 440
million euros. Accor said at the time that full-year revenue
rose 8.4 percent to 5.95 billion euros.  Net income was 3.6 billion euros compared with a year-
earlier loss of 282 million euros, the company also said today.
Accor reported the profit following a 4 billion-euro capital
gain from its demerger of the services business.  The company plans a dividend of 62 euro cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
