  Enterprise Products Partners LP , the
biggest U.S. pipeline partnership, offered to buy the portion of  Duncan Energy Partners LP  it doesn’t already own in an all-stock
deal that values the company at $2.41 billion.  Duncan holders would get 0.9545 unit of Enterprise for each
unit they own, under the proposal made to the board of Duncan’s
general partner, the two companies said today in separate
statements. The $41.71-a-unit offer represents a 28 percent
premium based on Duncan and Enterprise’s closing prices
yesterday.  The deal would be Houston-based Enterprise’s third and
smallest consolidation in the past two years of other pipeline
businesses started by Texas billionaire Dan Duncan, who died in
March at 77. Enterprise purchased its general partner,
Enterprise GP Holdings LP, for more than $8 billion in November.
It bought Teppco Partners LP for about $3.3 billion in October
2009.  “It’s an opportune time and strategically the deal makes
sense,” said Bernard Colson, a  Kansas City , Missouri-based
analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. who rates Enterprise units
“outperform” and owns none. “This is an easy deal to do for
them, because they don’t have to make any assumptions about the
assets.”  Enterprise already owns 58 percent of Houston-based Duncan
Energy’s common units, according to the statement today. It
controls Duncan’s operations through 100 percent ownership of
its general partner.  Enterprise Premium  The announcement was made before the start of regular
trading on U.S. markets. Duncan units rose $11.44, or 35
percent, to $44 at 8 a.m. in  New York . Units of Enterprise fell
63 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $43.07 at 8:44 a.m.  Based on the 20-day moving average of Duncan’s unit price,
Enterprise’s 28 percent premium offer is more than the 24
percent average premium for 187 U.S. pipeline company takeovers
in the past five years, according to Bloomberg data.  Duncan Energy Partners owns stakes in pipelines, storage
and processing of natural gas and petrochemicals, mostly in
Louisiana and  Texas . It has stakes in more than 9,400 miles
(15,000 kilometers) of gas pipelines with capacity of 7.9
billion cubic feet a day, and more than 1,600 miles of lines
carrying natural-gas liquids.  Enterprise, which gained 35 percent in the past year, has
50,200 miles of pipelines. As a master-limited partnership,
Enterprise is exempt from some taxes and pays out most of its  cash flow  to unit holders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
