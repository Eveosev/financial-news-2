A Libyan plane that had requested
permission to land at  Beirut ’s international airport Feb. 21 was
denied entry, according to Ghazi al Aridi, Lebanon’s caretaker
minister of transport and public works.  “There was a private plane the day before yesterday that
asked to come to Beirut,” Aridi said in a phone interview
today.  “We asked for the manifest to know who is on the plane,”
he said. “They didn’t provide us with any details so we didn’t
give the plane permission to land.”  The German news service DPA and other news organizations
reported speculation that a daughter-in-law of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  was on the plane. Relations between Libya and
Lebanon were strained by the disappearance of Imam Moussa al-
Sadr, chairman of Lebanon’s Shiite Islamic Council, who went
missing on a visit to  Libya  in August 1978 along with two of his
aides. Libyan officials said at the time that Sadr left the
country for  Italy .  Sadr was killed by the Qaddafi regime, according to Major
Abdel Moneim al-Houni, a former member of Libya’s revolutionary
command council who resigned as the country’s ambassador to the  Arab League  on Feb. 20. Houni told the  Saudi-owned Al-Hayat
newspaper  in an interview published today that Sadr was killed
and buried in the Sabha region in the southern part of Libya.  Houni said his brother-in-law, who was the pilot of
Qaddafi’s private plane, was tasked with transporting Sadr’s
body and was also killed after doing so to keep the crime
secret.  To contact the reporter on this story:
