  Gategroup Holding AG  fell the most
in five months after reporting a 22 million Swiss-franc ($23.5
million) fraud at a subsidiary.  The world’s second-biggest in-flight caterer dropped as
much as 8.7 percent, and was down 2.75 francs at 47.25 francs by
10:21 a.m. in Zurich trading. That gave the company a market
value of 1.24 billion francs.  External forensic accountants determined the fraud occurred
over the past three years, mostly before 2010, Gategroup said in
a statement on Tensid newswire. The crime resulted in an
estimated cash shortfall of about 10 million francs at the end
of last year, it said. Full-year results will probably be in
line with targets, Gategroup said.  “The fraud case is clearly unpleasant,” Rene Weber, an
analyst with Vontobel Holding AG with a “Buy” rating on the
stock, said today in a note to clients. “We clearly believe it
is an isolated issue and therefore a one-time item.”  Gategroup has been “able to identify and understand in
detail” how the fraud was carried out, Chief Executive Officer
Guy Dubois said in the statement, which gave no details.
“Significant recovery of assets has already happened and will
continue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
