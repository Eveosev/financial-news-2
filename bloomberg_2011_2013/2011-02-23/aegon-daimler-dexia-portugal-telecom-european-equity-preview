Gasoline rose as demand for the motor
fuel increased last week, equities advanced and the dollar
retreated, increasing the investment appeal of commodities.  Futures advanced as fuel consumption jumped 2.5 percent
from the prior week to an average 9.05 million barrels a day,
the Energy Department reported today. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index was up 0.5 percent as of 12:16 p.m. in New York. The U.S.
currency reversed a gain, dropping 0.2 percent against the euro.  “With the equities up and dollar down, the market has a
little bit of a bid in it,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Gasoline
has corrected so much from its highs, you had to wonder when the
selling pressure would let up and you didn’t see a really
bearish report today.”  Gasoline for June delivery added 3.4 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $2.9533 a gallon at 12:16 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have dropped 15 percent since reaching $3.48 on
April 29, the highest level since July 14, 2008.  On a four-week average, gasoline demand was 2.3 percent
below a year earlier as the U.S. approaches the summer driving
season.  “It’s getting to the point where we ought to see demand
rise instead of collapse in the face of high retail prices,”
said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc
in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “If summer demand doesn’t appear,
that will take the air out of the market.”  Peak Season  The peak gasoline demand period starts after the Memorial
Day holiday in late May and ends on Labor Day in early
September. The holidays fall on May 30 and Sept. 5 this year.  Refinery rates rose 1.5 percentage points to 83.2 percent
last week, the Energy Department reported. Refinery rates are
4.7 percent below a year earlier as historic flooding along the
 Mississippi River  has constrained fuel production and
distribution.  “The flooding is slowing refiners’ return to the market
but that is temporary and people know that,” Cohan said. “And
the flooding hasn’t impacted supply as deeply as expected.”  Total U.S. gasoline inventories increased 119,000 barrels
to 205.9 million last week, less than the 950,000 barrels
projected in a survey by Bloomberg News. Inventories are 16
percent below a year earlier.  “We only got a slight build in gasoline,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York 
and a broker at the Nymex.  East Coast Supplies  Supplies in PADD 1, which includes New York Harbor, the
delivery point for Nymex futures, fell 665,000 barrels to 50.8
million, 13 percent below a year earlier.  Regular retail gasoline dropped 1.8 cents yesterday to
$3.926 a gallon, AAA said on its website.  Stockpiles of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel, fell 1.16 million barrels to 143.1 million barrels.
Supplies are at the lowest level since April 2009. Demand
dropped 4 percent to 3.62 million barrels a day, the lowest
level since Jan. 14. Demand on a four-week average was 2.9
percent below a year earlier.  Heating oil for June delivery rose 6.15 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $2.9066 a gallon, after falling yesterday to the
lowest close since Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
