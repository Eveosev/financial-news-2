  China ’s yuan gained, after sliding
yesterday by the most this month, on speculation the government
will permit more appreciation to contain inflation.  The yuan’s advance came as the U.S. Dollar Index traded on
ICE futures in New York, a gauge of the greenback’s strength,
dropped for the first time in three days. Crude  oil prices 
jumped 11 percent in the past two days in New York on concerns a
week-long uprising in Libya will disrupt supplies. China
imported 54 percent of the oil it used in 2010, industry data
show.  “Beijing sees the usefulness of appreciation as part of
its policy to contain inflation, along with higher  interest
rates  and reserve requirement ratios,” said  David Cohen , head
of Asian forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore.
“Appreciation is another way to help contain price pressure
from global commodities.”  The yuan gained 0.09 percent to 6.5743 per dollar as of
4:30 p.m. in Shanghai, from 6.5803 yesterday, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It fell 0.21 percent
yesterday, retreating from a 17-year high of 6.5654 reached Feb.
21. The central bank set its daily  reference rate  0.09 percent
weaker at 6.5828.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.1 percent to
6.4215, reflecting bets the currency will strengthen 2.4 percent
in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s central bank last week ordered lenders to set aside
more money as reserves, a second time this year. Consumer prices
climbed 4.9 percent in January, compared with 4.6 percent in
December, the statistics bureau said on Feb. 15.  Cohen said the yuan may rise to 6.2 per dollar by the end
of this year.  -  Judy Chen , Fion Li. Editors: James Regan, Dirk Beveridge  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
