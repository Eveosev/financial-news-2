Average balances of 401(k)  retirement plans  reached a 10-year high at the end of last year
as workers continued to save and the market rebounded, according
to  Fidelity Investments .  The average account balance rose to $71,500 in 2010, up
about 11 percent from the end of 2009, according to a  report 
released today by the Boston-based mutual-fund manager. That
compares with an average balance of $54,700 in the fourth
quarter of 2000, the firm said. Fidelity, the largest provider
of 401(k)s, has 11 million participants in almost 17,000
employer-sponsored defined contribution plans.  “This is a very positive finding,” said Beth McHugh, vice
president of market insights for Fidelity. “People are
saving.”  About two-thirds of the increase in account balances last
year was driven by market performance while one-third was
attributed to participant action such as contributions, McHugh
said. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained about 13 percent
last year.  Workers deferred an average 8.2 percent of their salaries
to 401(k) accounts last year, a rate unchanged for the past two
years, the study said. That figure excludes employer matches,
which are typically 50 percent of employee contributions up to 6
percent saved, McHugh said.  Most participants continued to contribute through the
financial crisis and recognized that withdrawing funds or
borrowing from their plans would have a long-term effect on
their ability to retire, said McHugh. Almost four out of five
savers didn’t take a loan from their plans last year and 33
percent cashed out when leaving a job. The remainder stayed in
their plans or rolled money into individual retirement accounts,
she said.  Outliving Savings  Lawmakers and regulators concerned about Americans
outliving their savings have scrutinized fees and investments in
401(k)s as retirement money has shifted from traditional
pensions to defined contribution accounts. Target-date funds
in retirement plans, which move money from riskier assets such
as stocks to more conservative alternatives like bonds as a
worker ages, lost as much as 41 percent in 2008, according to  Morningstar Inc ., a Chicago-based research firm.  The fact that participants stayed in 401(k) plans and
continued to contribute after the  S&P 500 Index  lost 38 percent
in 2008 is “an ultimate validation that the program is
permanent,” said David Wray, president of the Chicago-based
Profit Sharing/401k Council of America.  “In the back of people’s minds all along was if we had a
bad event, the system would collapse,” Wray said. “This system
is now permanent. It’s the real deal. We went through the most
horrific experience that plan participants could have and they
stayed the course.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Margaret Collins  in  New York  at
