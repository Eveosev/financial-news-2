A & J Mucklow Group Plc, a U.K.
commercial real-estate investment and development company, said
first-half 2010 pretax profit fell 75 percent as revenue dropped
and after a one-time revaluation a year earlier.  Profit for the six months ended Dec. 31 fell to 4.8 million
pounds ($7.8 million) from 18.8 million pounds a year earlier,
the company said in a Regulatory News Service statement. Revenue
declined 15 percent to 8.8 million pounds.  “We remain positive about prospects for the full year and
intend to pursue the same strategy of keeping voids and
operating costs under control,” the company said in the
statement. “We have already seen a slight improvement in the
occupier markets and are aware of a number of serious
requirements in the market.”  In the same period last year the company benefited from an
11.6 million pounds revaluation surplus. Net rental income
related to investment and development properties in the first
half increased 6.9 percent to 8.5 million pounds. The company
raised its interim dividend to 8.27 pence per share from 8.03
pence a share a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
