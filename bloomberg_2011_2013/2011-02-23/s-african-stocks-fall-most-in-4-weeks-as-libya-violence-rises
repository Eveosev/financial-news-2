South Africa’s broadest stocks
measure fell the most in almost four weeks as unrest in North
Africa and the Middle East curbed demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.    BHP Billiton Plc , the world’s biggest mining company, led a
1.6 percent decline in the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index to
31,932.07 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. BHP retreated 2.6
percent to 271.50 rand while  Anglo American Plc , which makes up
11 percent of the gauge, dropped 2.1 percent to 363.07 rand.  Copper, a bellwether for global growth, fell to a four-week
low on speculation that unrest in North Africa and the Middle
East will derail recovering economies as  oil prices  jumped to
the highest since October 2008 on supply concerns. Governments
rushed to evacuate thousands of expatriates from Libya as army
units defected and a former aide to leader Muammar Qaddafi
warned that the spreading revolt may topple the regime in days.  “The focus really is still on the political events in  Libya  and the Middle East,” Francois Venter, an equity trader
at the Cape Town-based Investec Asset Management, said by
telephone. “That uncertainty, combined with a stronger rand,
puts pressure on the mining companies.”  A stronger rand raises local output costs as producers sell
metals for dollars and pay most costs in local currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
