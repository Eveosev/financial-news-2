  Vossloh AG  said it has “for the
time being” halted delivery of rail fasteners and switches for
a new railway line between Ras Adjer and Sirt in  Libya ,
following a request from China Civil Engineering Construction
Corporation, which manages the project.  The company expects to achieve a target of 1.4 billion
euros ($1.9 billion) in sales and earnings before interest and
taxes of more than 160 million euros in 2011 even if shipments
cannot be resumed this year, Vossloh said in a statement today,  To contact the reporter on this story:
