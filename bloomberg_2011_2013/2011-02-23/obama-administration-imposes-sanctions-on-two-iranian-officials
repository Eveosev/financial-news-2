President Barack Obama today added
two more Iranian officials to a list of those subject to U.S.
sanctions because of human rights abuses, the White House said
in a statement.  Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, the Tehran prosecutor general, and
Mohammed Reza Naqdi, commander of the Basij Forces, were singled
out by the Departments of State and Treasury today for their
involvement in human rights violations during or after  Iran â€™s
2009 presidential elections, the statement said.  Obama last year ordered sanctions against eight Iranian
national security officials for their involvement in abuses.
More officials may be subject to sanctions in the future, the
statement said.  The sanctions allow the U.S. to block any property or
assets the officials might own in the U.S. All American citizens
will be barred from doing business with the Iranians, who will
also be forbidden from getting visas to travel to the U.S.  Iran is under sanctions by the  United Nations  and the U.S.
for its refusal to stop working on enriching uranium, a step
toward assembling a nuclear bomb. Iran argues its nuclear
research is for civilian purposes such as medical research and
energy, while the U.S. and its allies accuse Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  of pursuing a weapons capability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
