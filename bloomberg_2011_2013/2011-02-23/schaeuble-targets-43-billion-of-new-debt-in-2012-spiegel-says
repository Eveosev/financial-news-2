German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  aims to lower Germanyâ€™s new debt to 31.4 billion euros
($43 billion) next year,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing a mid-term
finance plan sent by the minister to other ministries.  That compares with a previous plan of 40.1 billion euros,
the magazine said. New debt is scheduled to decline to 22.9
billion euros in 2013, to 18.7 billion euros the following year
and to 12.8 billion euros in 2015,  Der Spiegel  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
