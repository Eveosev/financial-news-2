Australia captain  Ricky Ponting  will
face a disciplinary hearing after a television was damaged in
the dressing room during the team’s Cricket World Cup opener
against Zimbabwe.  James Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the International Cricket
Council ruling body, confirmed Ponting will be charged. He said
by telephone he couldn’t give further details until Australian
team officials are informed.  The Press Trust of India reported that Ponting damaged the
TV after being run out for 28 by a direct hit in Australia’s
opening group match in Ahmedabad,  India , two days ago. Ponting
and the Australia team media manager Lachy Patterson couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  Ponting, 36, is trying to become the first captain to
win three consecutive  World Cup  titles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
