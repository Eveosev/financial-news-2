Australia captain  Ricky Ponting 
was reprimanded by the  International Cricket Council  after a
television was damaged in the dressing room during the team’s
Cricket World Cup opener against  Zimbabwe .  Ponting breached a clause in the ICC Code of Conduct that
covers “abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground
equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international
match,” cricket’s ruling body said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The incident occurred shortly after Ponting, 36, was run
out in the match in Ahmedabad,  India , two days ago. He caused
“some damage” to a television set in the team dressing room
when he threw down a piece of equipment which bounced off his
kit bag and hit the corner of the television, the ICC said.  “Ricky knows that his action was in breach of the code,
involving a brief moment of frustration,” match referee Roshan
Mahanama said in the statement. “That said, it was clear that
the damage he caused was purely accidental and without malice,
he apologized shortly after the incident at the ground and
immediately agreed to pay for the damage.”  Ponting has accepted the proposed sanction, the ICC said.
Low-level offenses typically carry penalties of up to half of a
player’s match fee.  Ponting is trying to become the first captain to win three
consecutive  World Cup  titles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
