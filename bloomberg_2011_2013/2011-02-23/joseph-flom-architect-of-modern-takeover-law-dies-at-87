Joseph Flom, the last surviving
original partner of law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom LLP and an architect of the laws and practices guiding U.S.
corporate takeovers, has died. He was 87.  He died today, the firm said in a news release. The cause
was heart failure.  Flom was “a giant in the takeover field, perhaps the
single most important force in the game during the 1970s and
1980s,” Robert Slater wrote in his 1999 book, “ The Titans of
Takeover .”  So feared was he “that arbitragers were eager to know
which side Joe Flom was on whenever a takeover was announced,”
Slater wrote. Some firms even paid Flom a retainer to make sure
he wouldn’t end up challenging them, a practice that became
known as the “Joe Flom protection policy.”  Flom, who joined Skadden as the firm’s first associate in
1948, was “the architect of the modern-day M&A law practice,”
Robert C. Sheehan, the firm’s executive partner from 1994 to
2009, said in a statement.  Flom orchestrated Ron Perelman’s 1985 takeover of Revlon
and ABC’s sale to Capital Cities. In 2008 he advised Anheuser-
Busch Cos. when it was bought for $52 billion by the Belgian
brewer InBev NV.  Joseph Harold Flom was born on Dec. 21, 1923, in Baltimore
and raised in  Brooklyn . After graduating from  City College  of  New York  and serving in the U.S. Army, he attended  Harvard Law
School  on the G.I. Bill, graduating in 1948, the year he joined
Skadden.  Survivors include his wife, Judi, sons Jason and Peter, and
daughter Nancy Laing. His first wife, Claire, died in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
