President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
is examining all options for pressuring Libya to end a violent
crackdown on anti-government demonstrators, and he is
dispatching Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  to  Switzerland  to
work with her counterparts from other nations on a coordinated
response.  In his first remarks on the uprising that has split the
North African country and prompted a deadly response from Libyan
leader Muammar Qaddafi and his loyalists, Obama described “the
suffering and bloodshed” as “outrageous” and said those
responsible must be held accountable.  “These actions violate international norms and every
standard of common decency,” Obama said yesterday at the White
House after meeting with Clinton.  While Obama didn’t specify what steps he would pursue if
Qaddafi doesn’t halt reprisals against the opposition, officials
at the White House and State Department said earlier they may
include punitive measures, such as freezing Libyan assets, that
might be taken by the U.S. alone or in conjunction with other
nations.  “That certainly includes looking at sanctions that could
be imposed, either bilaterally or multilaterally,” said  Philip J. Crowley , the State Department spokesman. “We believe it’s
important to coordinate our efforts with the national community,
our European allies, the  United Nations  and organizations like
the  Arab League .”  Geneva Meeting  That is part of the reason for Clinton’s trip. Obama said
she will attend a session of the United Nations  Human Rights
Council  in Geneva on Feb. 28 to work on a unified approach.  Libya  is a member of the council, and there have been calls to
expel the country from that body.  The U.S. also is continuing to address turmoil elsewhere in
the region and is seeking ways to support a peaceful transition
in Egypt and Tunisia, where protests have toppled longtime
leaders.  The uprising in Libya, which has the largest proven oil
reserves in Africa, has been the most violent yet of the anti-
government protests that have swept across the Middle East and
North Africa over the past six weeks. Clashes between anti-
government rebels and Qaddafi’s forces have resulted in the
deaths of about 300 people, according to Human Rights Watch.
Qaddafi warned Feb. 22 that he will fight the rebellion to his
death.  U.S. Personnel  The administration hasn’t moved yet to take direct action
against Qaddafi. That may be because U.S. officials are
concerned about possible retaliation against American personnel
still in the country, said Elliott Abrams, a deputy national
security adviser under President  George W. Bush .  The U.S. is rushing to evacuate its citizens from Libya. A
ferry scheduled to leave Tripoli yesterday with U.S. diplomats
and family members was delayed by bad weather.  Crowley said Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman
has spoken with Libyan officials in recent days and “requested
the Libyan government’s cooperation as we remove our citizens
and our diplomats and their families from Libya.”  Once U.S. personnel are safe, the White House should move
against the Qaddafi regime, Abrams said.  Freezing Accounts  Abrams, now a fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations
in  Washington , said U.S. actions might include freezing the
country’s bank accounts so Qaddafi loyalists can’t raid them,
imposing an international arms embargo on Libya and creating a
no-fly zone over the country enforced by the U.S. and NATO or
European Union air forces.  “I don’t see any reason for us not to begin that
discussion,” Abrams said. “You may run into Russian and
Chinese vetoes, but the discussion itself would show how much we
are concerned about this use of violence against the
population.”  Clinton said at a news conference earlier yesterday that
“everything is on the table.”  U.S. sanctions on Libya were lifted by Bush in 2004 in
return for Qaddafi’s agreement to dismantle his country’s
program to pursue chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.  The sanctions, imposed in 1986 because of Libyan
involvement in terrorist attacks, limited U.S. oil development
there, restricted air service between the two countries and
froze about $1.3 billion in Libyan assets.  Business Impact  Among the U.S. companies that do business in Libya now are  Marathon Oil Corp .,  ConocoPhillips  and  Halliburton Co . all based
in Houston; New York-based  Hess Corp . and Los Angeles-based  Occidental Petroleum Corp . Democratic Senator John Kerry of  Massachusetts , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has
urged U.S. and international oil companies to cease operations
in Libya.  The administration is monitoring oil markets for any effect
on prices from the unrest in Libya and its impact on the
economy, Austan Goolsbee, chairman of Obama’s Council of
Economic Advisers, told reporters today.  Echoing remarks by Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  made
yesterday, Goolsbee said the U.S. recovery can withstand the oil
price increases that have occurred so far because of the
turmoil.  “Anything like we have seen so far, neither we nor the
private sector has forecast that would derail our recovery,”
Goolsbee said at a breakfast today organized by the Christian
Science Monitor.  Oil Prices  Crude in  New York  today surged to the highest level in 29
months as Libya’s uprising reduced supplies from  Africa ’s third-
biggest oil-producing country.  Futures climbed as much as 5.4 percent on estimates that
the revolt caused Libya to lose as much as two-thirds of its oil
output. The cuts create “significant upside risk” to prices
and any further disruptions could create severe shortages in
global oil markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1.24, or 1.3 percent, to
$99.34 a barrel at 10:14 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract reached $103.41, the highest intraday
price since Sept. 29, 2008. Futures are up 24 percent from a
year ago.  Obama said yesterday the U.S. is applying the same “core
principles” to Libya as it did in response to the popular
uprisings that have toppled leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt , as
well as protests in nations across the Middle East and North
Africa.  Those include condemnation of violence against protesters
and support for the right of citizens to gather, speak freely
and determine their own destiny, he said.  “These are human rights,” Obama said. “They are not
negotiable. They must be respected in every country.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
