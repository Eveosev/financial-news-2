  Fluor Corp ., the largest publicly
traded U.S. construction company, declined for a third day on
concern over costs for a second straight quarter on a U.K.
offshore wind farm.  The shares fell $2.18, or 3.1 percent, to $68.39 at 4 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading, adding to a 6.7
percent drop in the previous two days. Flour has risen 3.2
percent this year.  Fluor said today it took a $180 million charge on the
Greater Gabbard wind farm in the fourth quarter after reporting
a $163 million expense in the previous quarter for the same
project. The Irving, Texas-based company also announced in its
fourth-quarter earnings report a $28 million cost on a gas-fired
power plant in  Georgia .  “That’s still a risk,” said Chase Jacobson, an analyst
with Sterne Agee & Leech Inc. in New York in a telephone
interview. “Anytime there’s a recurring cost overrun on a large
project like this, investors are going to get worried,” said
Jacobson, who recommends buying the shares.  The charges caused fourth-quarter net income to fall 21
percent to $117.1 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with
$148.7 million, or 82 cents, a year earlier. Earnings missed the
average estimate of 75 cents from 21 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Gabbard Project  The Gabbard project was affected by the bankruptcy of
Subocean, which was responsible for installing subsea cabling
for giant  wind turbines , and the higher costs to replace the
contractor, said David Seaton, Fluor’s chief executive officer
on a conference call with analysts. Seaton, who became CEO
earlier this month, said Gabbard was an “expensive lesson” and
that Fluor would insist on controlling marine assets in future
projects.  The Gabbard project is 72 percent completed, Seaton said.
The company doesn’t have anything else “unusual” in its
backlog of projects that could cause more problems, he said.  Fluor’s sales fell 3.9 percent to $5.27 billion, falling
short of a forecast of $5.63 billion from 17 analysts surveyed.
Sales were hurt by a 16 percent drop in revenue from the oil and
gas unit, the company’s largest business segment, to $2.09
billion.  Fluor’s backlog of projects rose to $34.9 billion from $33
billion at the end of September. The company posted a record
backlog of $36.5 billion at the end of September 2008 after
crude oil jumped to more than $140 a barrel two months earlier.  Seaton said the backlog would continue to rise during 2011
and that the company was beginning to book oil and gas projects
at higher margins.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Thomas Black  in Monterrey at
