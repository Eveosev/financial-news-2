  Valeo SA ,  France ’s second-largest
auto-parts supplier, agreed to buy Japan’s Niles Co. to boost
its presence in  Asia .  Valeo will buy 77.9 percent of Niles, whose customers
include Nissan Motors Co. and General Motors Co., from  RHJ
International  SA, for 15.5 billion yen ($190 million). The
transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of
this year, the company said today in a statement.  Valeo, whose products include headlamps, hands-free
parking devices and “stop-and-start” systems for saving fuel,
“would strengthen its position in Asia and with Japanese
automakers, particularly Nissan, with this acquisition,” it
said in a statement.  Valeo shares fell 2.5 percent at 9:39 a.m. in Paris, where
the company is based, to 42.10 euros, giving the company a
market value of 3.3 billion euros.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:  Kenneth Wong  at   kwong11@bloomberg.net ;
