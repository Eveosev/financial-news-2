Moody’s Investors Service said it
placed Bahrain’s credit ratings on review for a possible
downgrade as it assesses the impact of anti-government protests
in the Persian Gulf country.  The review of the A3 government bond rating, the fourth-
lowest investment grade, will be concluded within three months,
Moody’s said today in an e-mailed statement. Moody’s downgraded
the government’s bond ratings one level, to A3, on Aug. 23.  “The review will focus on the degree to which political
risk has structurally increased and how significantly the credit
fundamentals of Bahrain are threatened relative to rating
peers,” Moody’s said.  Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa called for
national dialogue to help ease the political turmoil that
started on Feb. 14 with protests mainly by the Persian Gulf
island kingdom’s Shiite Muslims. Bahrain’s long-term rating was
cut one level to A-, the fourth-lowest investment grade, and the
short-term rating lowered to A-2 by Standard & Poor’s Feb. 21.  Bahrain’s 10-year dollar bond maturing in 2020 rose for a
second day, with the yield falling 7 basis points to 6.69
percent at 1:56 p.m. in the capital, Manama. The yield on
Bahrain’s 6.247 percent, five-year Islamic bond was little
changed at 3.9 percent, according to Bloomberg composite prices.  “Barring an extreme outcome to the political unrest,
Moody’s expects Bahrain’s ratings to remain within investment
grade,” according to the company’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
