Portugal’s  PSI-20 Index  rose 19.75,
or 0.3 percent, to 7,889.3 in Lisbon, extending the previous
day’s gain.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Portuguese market today.  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES PL), Portugal’s biggest
publicly traded bank, rose 1 percent to 3.12 euros.  Banco
Comercial Portugues SA  (BCP PL), the second-largest, climbed 1
percent to 63.8 euro cents. German Chancellor Angela Merkel
signaled that European Union leaders may extend Greece’s bailout
program as part of a broader package to shore up confidence in
the euro.  Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT PL), Portugal’s biggest
retailer, rose 3.2 percent to 11.64 euros, following three
straight declines.  “We believe that the negative share price reaction
following Jeronimo Martins’ fourth-quarter results on February
18 presents a compelling opportunity,” Franklin Walding, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
