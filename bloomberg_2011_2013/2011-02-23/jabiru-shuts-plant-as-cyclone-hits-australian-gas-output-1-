The halting of some natural gas
output in Western Australia because of Tropical Cyclone Carlos
forced copper and zinc producer  Jabiru Metals Ltd . to shut down
its gas power station and concentrator plant.    Santos Ltd . advised the company that gas supplies are
likely to be disrupted by the extreme weather conditions, Perth-
based Jabiru said today in a statement. It’s operating its
Jaguar and Bentley mines with diesel fuel until supply normal
resumes, which may be after two or three days.  Tropical Cyclone Carlos, a category two storm, forced
Apache Corp. to halt gas production from its Varanus Island
operations. Gas supplies are expected to return to normal within
seven days after production was halted at 12:30am yesterday,
Western Australia’s Office of Energy said on its website.  “The state government is working closely with industry, in
particular the North West Shelf Project, to restore normal
availability of gas,” the department said. It’s asked residents
to reduce electricity and natural gas use.  Santos spokesman  Matthew Doman  couldn’t immediately
comment.  Varanus is Western Australia’s second-largest producer of
domestic gas and provides more than 30 percent of supplies. An
explosion at the plant in June 2008 reduced supplies to the  mining industry  in the Pilbara and the Goldfields region,
forcing companies to switch to diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
