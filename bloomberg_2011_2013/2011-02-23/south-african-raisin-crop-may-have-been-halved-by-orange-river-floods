Raisin producers in  South Africa  may
have suffered losses of as much as 300 million rand ($42
million) because of floods.  “The 2011 crop may be 50 percent down on the 2010 crop,”
Dappies Smit, General Manager of Dried Fruit Technical Services,
a branch of the  Deciduous Fruit Producers’ Trust , said in an e-
mailed response to questions.  South Africa may produce between 20,000 and 25,000 metric
tons of raisins this year, down from a record 50,628 tons last
year, he said. Farmers may suffer further losses when the cost
of damaged infrastructure and vineyards from floods along the
Orange River is calculated, Smit said.  The country is the world’s fifth-largest raisin producer in
a market dominated by the U.S.,  Turkey  and  Iran , according to
Johannesburg-based  Douglas Investments , which owns a raisin-
producing facility in the Northern Cape Province.  The smallest crop in the last decade was 30,416 tons in
2005, Smit said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
