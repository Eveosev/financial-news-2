BTA Bank, the biggest Kazakh lender
to default in 2009, posted a loss of 5.62 billion tenge ($38
million) in January, the country’s financial regulator said.  Alliance Bank’s 1.8 billion-tenge loss was the second-
biggest among 39 Kazakh lenders in January, the Almaty-based
Financial Supervision Agency said in a  report  on its website
today.  BTA, Kazakhstan’s largest lender at the time, was taken
over in early 2009 by the National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna
after credit markets froze and the country’s property bubble
burst. Three of the four Kazakh lenders that defaulted -- BTA,
Temirbank and Alliance Bank -- reached restructuring deals with
creditors, allowing them to write off about $11 billion of debt.  BTA had a profit of 1.15 trillion tenge last year after
creditors cut the bank’s debt to $4.2 billion from $16.7
billion, according to the regulator’s website.  Ilya Borovoi, a spokesman for Almaty-based BTA Bank,
declined to comment immediately.  The following table shows the January performance of  Kazakhstan ’s six largest lenders, along with 14th-ranked
Temirbank, and their position as of Feb. 1. The data from the
Agency for Financial Supervision is in billions of tenge and
calculated to Kazakh accounting standards:  To contact the reporter on this story:
