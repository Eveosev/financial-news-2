  Jefferies Group Inc ., the New York-
based investment bank, the Government of Singapore Investment
Corp. and LoanCore LLC, formed a joint venture to originate
commercial real-estate debt in the U.S.  The company, to be known as Jefferies LoanCore LLC, can
draw on $600 million in capital, the firm said today in a
statement. Mark Finerman, the founder of LoanCore LLC, will lead
the venture, according to the statement.  Finerman was raising $3 billion in 2008 for a fund to make
senior property loans, people familiar with the matter said in
October of that year. He had raised money from Singapore’s GIC,
a sovereign wealth fund for the island nation, people familiar
with the matter said at the time.  “As our industry recovers from the disruption of the
recent financial crisis, we expect Jefferies LoanCore to be a
leader in providing creative capital solutions,” Finerman said
in the statement.  Finerman left RBS Greenwich Capital, a unit of  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc , as head of commercial real-estate lending
in May 2008.  Before joining RBS Greenwich Capital in 2002, Finerman
oversaw commercial mortgage bonds at  Credit Suisse First Boston .
He worked at CSFB from 1996 to 2001, leaving briefly in 2001 for  Barclays Capital  with 39 other bond executives before being
lured back to the firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
