  Washington Post Co . said fourth-
quarter profit fell 3.3 percent after sales declined in its
education unit, which is facing government scrutiny, and
advertising revenue at its newspaper business dropped.  Net income declined to $79 million, or $9.42 a share, from
$81.7 million, or $8.71, a year earlier, the Washington-based
company said today in a statement. The company, which publishes
the Washington Post newspaper and owns Kaplan educational
businesses, said results included severance, restructuring and
pension plan costs.  Earnings declined 18 percent at Kaplan, which accounts for
more than half of total revenue. Enrollment growth for education
programs slowed and the company said potential rulemaking by the
U.S. Department of Education could have a “adverse effect” on
Kaplan’s future operating results.  Total sales rose less than 1 percent to $1.19 billion.  Revenue at the newspaper division, which also includes the
Herald of Everett,  Washington , fell 3 percent to $188.4 million.
The Post’s print ad sales fell 12 percent to $82 million.  The company, like other newspaper publishers, has trimmed
costs by eliminating jobs and combining or shortening sections
as advertising continues to migrate to digital news outlets and
print circulation drops.  Washington Post fell $25.83, or 5.9 percent, to $414.55 at
4 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have declined 5.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
