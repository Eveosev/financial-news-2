  Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd ., a
Chinese marine fuel supplier, plans to open offices in  London 
and Geneva to increase trading of oil products.  The company is “expanding the existing business from
trading purely fuel oil to a full array of petroleum products,”
according to a statement filed to the  Hong Kong  Stock Exchange
today.  Brightoil currently has overseas offices in Singapore and
Houston to manage its trading business, it said. The company’s
bunker fuel sales volume doubled to 3.4 million metric tons in
2010 from a year earlier, according to the company. Brightoil
has bunker operations at ports in  China , Singapore, Hong Kong
and the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area.  “We are also relentlessly seeking opportunities to lease
storage and terminal facilities from local operators, or to form
strategic partnerships with storage owners, or construct our own
facilities,” the company said in the statement.  Revenue for Brightoil’s international supply and bunkering
segment amounted to HK$12.48 billion ($1.6 billion) for the six
months ended Dec. 31. Of the total, 70 percent was contributed
by its bunker business, while the remaining was earned through
oil-product trading, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
