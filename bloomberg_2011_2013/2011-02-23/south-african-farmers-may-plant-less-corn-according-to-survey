South African farmers may plant less
corn this season, a survey showed.  The Crop Estimates Committee may say tomorrow sowing will
come to 2.4 million hectares (5.9 million acres), the median
estimate of six traders surveyed by Bloomberg News shows.
Projections ranged from 2.3 million to 2.52 million hectares.  Corn planting probably will fall 8.3 percent to 2.52
million hectares this year,  South Africa â€™s government said on
Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
