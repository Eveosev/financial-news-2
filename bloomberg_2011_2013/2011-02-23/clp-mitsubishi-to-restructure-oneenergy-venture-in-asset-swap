  CLP Holdings Ltd . will restructure
its OneEnergy Ltd. venture with  Mitsubishi Corp . in a swap of
assets and cash, and book a net HK$881 million gain, the Hong
Kong-based company said in a statement to the city’s exchange
today.  CLP Holdings will acquire the 50 percent of OneEnergy it
doesn’t already own from Mitsubishi, while selling off its 13.4
percent stake in Thailand’s Electricity Generating Public Co. to
the Tokyo-based company for $273 million in value, the statement
said. Mitsubishi will take ownership of OneEnergy Thailand, a
subsidiary of OneEnergy, as part of the transaction, the
statement said.  OneEnergy Taiwan, another unit of the venture, will remain
jointly owned between CLP and Mitsubishi after the
reorganization is complete, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
