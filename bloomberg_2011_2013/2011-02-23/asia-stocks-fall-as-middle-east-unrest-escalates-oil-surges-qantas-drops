Asian stocks fluctuated as oil
companies advanced as escalating violence in  Libya  triggered a
surge in crude prices, countering declines among airlines.  SK Holdings Co.,  South Korea ’s biggest oil explorer by
sales, climbed 2.1 percent in Seoul.  Qantas Airways Ltd . and
Korean Air Lines Co. fell at least 1.3 percent as soaring crude
oil futures sparked concern higher fuel prices will curb the
earnings outlook for the region’s carriers. Kubota Corp., a
Japanese farm-equipment maker, declined 1.8 percent in Tokyo
after Credit Suisse Group AG lowered its rating to
‘underperform.”  “The world economic outlook is becoming more uncertain,”
said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc. “Investors are becoming more concerned
about inflation in emerging markets and higher corporate costs
because of rising oil prices.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.1 percent to 137.11
as of 10:35 a.m. in Tokyo, with about four stocks falling for
every three that rose. The gauge climbed 3 percent last week,
the most since the period ended Dec. 3, as reports showed a U.S.
economic recovery and corporate earnings are improving.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average dropped 0.1 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 0.1 percent, while New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little changed. South Korea’s Kospi
Index rose lost 0.1 percent.  Stocks slumped yesterday from  Hong Kong  and  London  to Sao
Paulo as Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi vowed to fight a growing
rebellion until his “last drop of blood” and pledged to deploy
the army and police to impose order. Qaddafi’s crackdown on a
weeklong uprising has already left more than 200 dead, according
to Human Rights Watch.  Middle East, Wal-Mart  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. The gauge declined 2.1 percent in  New York 
yesterday, its biggest drop since August, as concern mounted
about the situation in the Middle East and as  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc ., the world’s biggest retailer, reported sales that trailed
its own forecasts.  Crude oil for March delivery gained 8.6 percent to $93.57 a
barrel in New York yesterday, the highest settlement since Oct.
3, 2008, on concern that supplies from Libya, holder of Africa’s
largest crude reserves, may be disrupted. The April delivery
contract rose as much as 2.7 percent in Asian trading today.  The yen appreciated to as high as 82.58 against the dollar,
compared with 83.31 at the close of stock trading yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to 112.24 last
night from 113.23. A stronger yen reduces overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.6 percent by the S&P
500 and 3.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.9 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Today, 22 of the 1,019 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 488 companies
that have reported results for the latest quarter, 191 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 150 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
