  Namibia  economy expanded 4.6 percent
last year, driven by a 31.8 percent jump in the  mining industry 
in the world’s biggest miner of offshore diamonds and the
fourth-largest uranium producer, the central bank said.  Economic growth will ease to 4.1 percent this year, with
mining output rising 2.7 percent, the Bank of Namibia said in
the economic outlook released in the capital, Windhoek, today.  “The robust performance in mining in 2010 is attributed to
the somewhat increased diamond prices and global demand for the
gems,” the bank said.  Diamond production leaped 56.6 percent to 1.47 million
carats last year and will probably remain at that level in 2011,
the central bank said. Namibia’s diamonds are the world’s best
quality, averaging about $321 a carat, according to the
Windhoek-based Institute for Public Policy Research. The gems
are produced by Namdeb, a joint venture between the government
and  De Beers .  The central bank had estimated economic growth last year at
4.2 percent on Dec. 15.  Namibia’s uranium production is projected to increase to
5,956 metric tons in 2011 from 5,688 tons last year, the central
bank said. Zinc output will increase to 205,871 tons from
205,339 and gold production will drop 2,648 tons from 2,732
tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
