  Iran  has identified the people
behind the death of two university students in an anti-
government rally, Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi said.  “Necessary measures have been adopted,” and further
details will be made public later, Moslehi said today, according
to the state-run  Fars  news agency.  Saneh Jaleh and another male student, Mohammad Mokhtari,
were reported to have been killed by gunshots during anti-
government demonstrations on Feb. 14. Opposition leaders Mehdi Karrubi and Mir-Hossein Mousavi had called for the rally in
solidarity with protesters who toppled Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak . Iran’s opposition says Jaleh was among its supporters
and was killed by security forces, while authorities said he was
pro-government and that protesters were behind the deaths.  Moslehi said “antirevolutionary forces” and the People’s
Mujahedeen, an exiled opposition group, were responsible and
that the killing had been “premeditated,” according to Fars.  Domestic dissent has been revived in Iran over the past 10
days as turmoil spread from the Arab world to the  Persian Gulf .
Further clashes took place on Feb. 20 at a march aimed to honor
the dead demonstrators. Protesters were met with tear gas and
baton charges and Iran’s government has further isolated Mousavi
and Karrubi by putting them under house arrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
