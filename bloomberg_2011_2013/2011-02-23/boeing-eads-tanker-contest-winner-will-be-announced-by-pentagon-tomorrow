The U.S. Defense Department will
announce tomorrow the winner of the $35 billion aerial tanker
contest pitting  Boeing Co . against European Aeronautic, Defence
& Space Co., according to a government official.  The decision was made today when senior Pentagon and Air
Force officials -- including Deputy Defense Secretary William
Lynn, weapons buyer  Ashton Carter , procurement director Shay
Assad and Air Force program manager Brigadier General
 Christopher Bogdan  -- met to review the announcement, said the
official, who was not authorized to discuss the decision prior
to the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.  Boeing, based in  Chicago , and EADS, which has headquarters
in Paris and Munich, are vying for a contract of about $35
billion to replace 179 of the Pentagonâ€™s fleet of more than 500
KC-135 tankers.  The U.S. military depends on in-flight refueling to extend
the range of combat and transport planes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
