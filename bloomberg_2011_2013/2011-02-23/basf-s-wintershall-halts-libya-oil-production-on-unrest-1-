  BASF SE ’s Wintershall unit, the
operator of eight  oil fields  in the Libyan desert, halted oil
and gas production in the North African country as a revolt
spreads to topple the regime of  Muammar Qaddafi .  The German company, based in Kassel, halted production
after evacuating most of its employees, spokesman Nicholas Neu
said by telephone today. Wintershall produced as much as 100,000
barrels of oil a day in Libya, and had 453 people in the
country, according to the company. Wintershall is closely
monitoring developments in Libya, it said.  Wintershall has operated in Libya since 1958, and the
country represented 14 percent of BASF’s exploration and
production reserves in 2009, according to a  presentation . BASF
had sales of 1.39 billion euros ($1.91 billion) at its oil and
gas exploration and production business in Northern Africa and
the Middle East in 2009, with unit pretax profit of 1.08 billion
euros.  “Libya is a very important contributor to BASF’s oil and
gas segment,” analyst Martin Roediger of Cheuvreux in Frankfurt
said in a note to clients yesterday. The analyst, who has BASF
on his “select list,” estimates that writing off the Libyan
assets would result in an impact of about 600 million euros.  BASF, which reports quarterly earnings tomorrow, declined
as much as 61 cents, or 1 percent, to 58.88 euros, the third
consecutive drop. The shares have gained 38 percent in value in
the last six months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
