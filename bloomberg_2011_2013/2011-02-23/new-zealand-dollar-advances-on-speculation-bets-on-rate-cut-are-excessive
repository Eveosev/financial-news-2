  New Zealand ’s dollar touched a two-
month low against the dollar as traders added to bets the
central bank will cut  interest rates  at its next meeting after
an earthquake rocked the nation’s second-largest city.  The kiwi, as the currency is nicknamed, fell against most
of its major counterparts after Prime Minister John Key said the
magnitude 6.3 temblor that struck Christchurch yesterday is
likely to cost reinsurers around NZ$5 billion ($3.7 billion).
Australia’s dollar rose after central bank Governor Glenn Stevens said mining investment may increase by as much as 2
percent of gross domestic product in the next few years.  “In the near term there will be a bit of uncertainty in
the markets around the kiwi, and it may come under selling
pressure,” said Besa Deda, chief economist in Sydney at St.
George Bank, a unit of  Australia ’s second-biggest lender. The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand “might push out tightening.”  New Zealand’s dollar fell as much as 0.4 percent to 74.33
U.S. cents, the lowest level since Dec. 23, before trading at
74.54 cents at 11:52 a.m. in  New York , down 0.1 percent. It
closed yesterday at 74.64 cents. The kiwi weakened 0.6 percent
to 61.44 yen, from 61.78 yen yesterday.  Australia’s currency gained 0.2 percent to $1.0004, from
99.88 cents yesterday, after rising as high as $1.0059. The
Aussie declined 0.3 percent to 82.44 yen, from 82.67.  Rate Wagers  The probability the  Reserve Bank of New Zealand  will lower
its 3 percent benchmark rate at its March 10 meeting is 56
percent, up from 28 percent yesterday, according to a Credit
Suisse AG index based on swaps.  The earthquake that struck Christchurch killed at least 75
people with the death toll likely to rise as rescuers comb the
ruins of office buildings. Public finances already face an
estimated NZ$5 billion cleanup bill from a Sept. 4 quake in
which no one died.  Australia is undergoing its biggest mining investment surge
since the 19th century to meet rising demand for the nation’s
iron ore and coal. The challenge facing policy makers is to
ensure the boom doesn’t turn into a bust, Stevens said in a
speech in  Melbourne .  To contact the reporters on this story:
