U.S. Gulf crude premiums widened as
West Texas Intermediate weakened compared to its European
counterpart.  The gap between April-delivery WTI futures and Brent, the
basis for European and West African crudes, widened $1.49 to
$11.85 at 12:50 p.m. in  New York . The differential settled at a
record $15.94 Feb. 16. The spread averaged 63 cents in 2010.  When Brent is higher than WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oils
priced against Brent.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI strengthened $1 to $12 a barrel, while Poseidon’s
premium widened $1.85 to $12.35 over the benchmark, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg at 12:17 p.m.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $11 a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI strengthened $2.50 to
$16.50. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 50 cents to $5. WTS
is delivered in Midland,  Texas , so its price is less influenced
by imports.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed 10 cents to $17.40
a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened 25
cents to $17.  Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $7.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta. The discount for Western Canada Select was
unchanged at $24.50.    Enbridge Inc . said yesterday it planned to allocate space
on five pipelines for March shipments because demand for crude
shipments exceeds capacity.  Line 5, which runs from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia,
Ontario, and has a capacity of 490,000 barrels a day, will be
able to meet 81 percent of next month’s orders to move oil, said  Gina Jordan , a spokeswoman for the Calgary-based company.  Line 6B, which has a capacity of 290,000 barrels a day and
runs between Griffith, Indiana, and Sarnia, Ontario, can meet 86
percent of shipper requests for February.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
