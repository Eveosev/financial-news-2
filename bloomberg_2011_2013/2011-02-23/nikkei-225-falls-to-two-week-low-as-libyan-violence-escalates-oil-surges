Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average
fell to its lowest level in more than two weeks as violence
escalated in Libya and crude  oil prices  rose, sparking concern
the global economic recovery may slow.    Toyota Motor Corp ., the world’s biggest carmaker, fell 1.7
percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc ., Japan’s largest
publicly traded bank, declined 1.1 percent. Nippon Yusen K.K.,
Japan’s No. 1 shipping line, slid 2.7 percent. Inpex Corp., the
nation’s largest oil and gas explorer, sank 4.1 percent on
concern unrest in the Middle East will cut crude supply.  The Nikkei dropped 0.8 percent to 10,579.10 as of the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, the lowest level since Feb. 4. The broader Topix
index lost 1 percent to 946.88, with about four stocks declining
for every one that advanced. Both indexes fell for a second day.  “The world economic outlook is becoming more uncertain,”
said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc. “Investors are becoming more concerned
about inflation in emerging markets and higher corporate costs
because of rising oil prices.”  Stocks slumped yesterday from  Hong Kong  and  London  to Sao
Paulo as Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi vowed to fight a growing
rebellion until his “last drop of blood” and pledged to deploy
the army and police to impose order.  Improved Earnings  The Topix had risen 8.4 percent this year through Feb. 21
as companies reported improved earnings. That pushed the index
to the highest level since April and boosted the average price
of stocks in the measure to 16.5 times estimated earnings. The
valuation compares with 13.7 times on the Standard and Poor’s
500 Index and 11.3 times on the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Toyota fell 1.7 percent to 3,740 yen, while Honda Motor
Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker, declined 1.8 percent to
3,525 yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropped 1.1 percent to 448
yen and Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 3 publicly
traded lender, fell 1.2 percent to 164 yen.  Oil rose from its highest close in more than two years on
concern the uprising in  Libya  will disrupt exports from  Africa ’s
third-biggest supplier of crude and unrest will intensify in
oil-producing nations in the Middle East. Crude for April
delivery was at $95.48 a barrel, up 6 cents, or 0.1 percent, in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:55
p.m. in  Singapore .  Inpex, Japan Petroleum  Energy-related companies retreated the most among the 33
industry groups on the Topix. Inpex sank 4.1 percent to 566,000
yen, the Nikkei’s biggest decline. Japan Petroleum Exploration
Co., the nation’s second-largest oil explorer, slumped 2.6
percent to 3,910 yen.  “The biggest concern is the crude oil supply,” said
Koichi Kurose, chief strategist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd.,
which manages about $57 billion in assets.  Shares of shipping companies declined after Baltic Dry
Index, a gauge of cargo rates, fell for a second day. Nippon
Yusen slumped 2.7 percent to 368 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd.,
operator of the world’s largest merchant fleet, slid 1.8 percent
to 543 yen. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Japan’s third-largest
shipping line, decreased 3.3 percent to 356 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
