U.K. shoppers cut spending after
sales taxes rose in January and concern mounted over government
job cuts, the London-based Times reported, citing a survey of
retail chains by the newspaper.  The survey, which included John Lewis Partnership Plc and
Asda Group Plc, reported that areas with high government
employment suffered the biggest drop in sales, the newspaper
added.  An analysis of John Lewis stores showed that sales in areas
where fewer than 17 percent of the workforce was employed by the
government rose 4.3 percent in the six months to Jan. 22,
whereas sales fell 2.1 percent in areas the state employs more
than 25 percent of the workers, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
