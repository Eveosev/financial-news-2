Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS,  Turkey ’s biggest mobile phone company, said fourth-quarter
profit rose 46 percent, aided by a drop in charges and
provisions.  Net income rose to 368.1 million liras ($229 million),
compared with 252.8 million liras a year earlier, the company
said in a PRNewswire statement. Turkcell had been expected to
earn 442.6 million liras, according to a Bloomberg survey of
eight analysts.  “In 2011, we expect high single-digit top line growth and
a similar ebitda margin compared to 2010,” Chief Executive
Officer Sureyya Ciliv said in the statement. “This growth will
mainly be driven by higher voice and mobile Internet revenues,
as well as growing contributions from our subsidiaries,” Ciliv
said.  Turkcell, partly owned by  Sweden ’s  Teliasonera AB , is
seeking to boost revenue as it faces more competition in its
home market from  Vodafone Group Plc  and Avea Iletisim Hizmetleri
AS, majority owned by  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS . Turkey’s
information and technology market grew 6 percent to $35 billion
in 2010, the country’s regulator said last month.  Turkcell revenue fell to 2.19 billion liras in the fourth
quarter, down from 2.26 billion liras in the corresponding
period in 2009. It had 33.5 million subscribers at the end of
the fourth quarter, down from 33.9 million in the previous
quarter.  Postpaid Users Grow  “Turkcell’s growth in postpaid subscribers is continuing
and this is boosting its sales and profit,” Can Oztoprak, an
analyst at Istanbul-based FinansInvest, said before the results
were released. “Its competitors, especially Vodafone, will aim
to increase Ebitda margin with more rational campaigns and
tariffs which will in turn improve competition and also help
Turkcell with its core business.” Oztoprak has an
“outperform” rating on Turkcell.  Average monthly revenue per user rose 3.2 percent in the
fourth quarter to $12.9 from $12.5 a year earlier.  The Turkish telecommunications regulator cut the maximum
tariff an operator can impose by 38 percent, while the maximum
rate operators charge each other, or mobile termination rates,
was lowered by 52 percent from April, 2010. Turkcell is the
biggest loser of the regulatory moves, said Cemal Demirtas, an
analyst at the Istanbul-based Oyak Securities.  Growth Outlook  A reduction in termination rates and a maximum pricing
introduced by regulator as well as “marketing initiatives” by
the rivals will have a “negative impact” on first-quarter
financial results, with an “gradual improvement” beginning in
the second-quarter, Ciliv said in the statement.  Turkcell had to revise its lira-denominated sales growth
target to between 1 percent and 5 percent for 2010 from 10
percent it had set before the regulator’s decision, CEO Ciliv
said on July 27.  Turkcell will probably increase its lira-based sales
between 7 and 9 percent in 2011, Ciliv said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television on Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
