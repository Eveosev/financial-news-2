  Enbridge Inc . will allocate space on
five pipelines for March because demand for crude shipments
exceeds capacity, according to an e-mail from the company.  Line 5, which runs from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia,
Ontario, and has a capacity of 490,000 barrels a day, will be
able to meet 81 percent of next month’s orders to move oil,  Gina Jordan , a spokeswoman for the Calgary-based company, said in an
e-mail. The line will have self-imposed rate restrictions in
support of maintenance and integrity dig activities, she said.  Line 6B, which has a capacity of 290,000 barrels a day and
runs between Griffith,  Indiana , and Sarnia, Ontario, can meet 86
percent of shipper requests for February.  Apportionment means orders to ship oil through the
pipelines exceeded the lines’ capacities. Shippers must cut
their nominations by the apportionment ratio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
