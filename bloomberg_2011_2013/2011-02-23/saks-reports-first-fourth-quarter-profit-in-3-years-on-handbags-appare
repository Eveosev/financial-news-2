  Saks Inc ., the New York-based luxury
retail chain, reported its first fourth-quarter profit in three
years as improved consumer confidence prompted customers to
splurge on apparel and handbags again during the holiday season.  Net income was $25 million, or 14 cents a share, in the
three months ended Jan. 29, compared with a net loss of $4.61
million, or 3 cents, a year earlier, the retailer said in a
statement today. Profit excluding store closings was 13 cents.
Ten analysts estimated 8 cents on average in a Bloomberg survey.  Luxury consumers increased spending during the holidays
after stock markets improved and the  U.S. economy  recovered from
the longest recession since the Great Depression. Saks said it
saw rising demand for women’s and men’s clothes, purses and
shoes. It forecast a mid-single digit increase in percentage
terms in sales at stores open at least a year in 2011.  Goldman Sachs analysts had predicted a low-to-mid single
digit growth for comparable sales.  The shares dropped 31 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, reversing a
gain earlier in the day, as U.S. stock markets fell amid concern
that rising energy costs will slow economic growth. Saks has
advanced 11 percent this year.  Fourth-quarter sales rose 6.8 percent to $866.3 million,
Saks said, after gaining 4.3 percent in the third quarter and
slumping 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. Same-store
sales increased 8.4 percent last quarter.  Saks operates 47 Saks Fifth Avenue Stores and 57 Off 5th
stores.    Consumer Confidence   Confidence among U.S. consumers rose in February to the
highest level in three years as Americans became more optimistic
about their incomes and the economy.  The Conference Board’s index of sentiment increased to
70.4, the highest since February 2008, from 64.8 the prior
month, figures from the New York-based private research group
showed yesterday.    Macy’s Inc ., the second-biggest U.S. department-store
chain, yesterday reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates
after keeping a lid on costs and selling exclusive holiday gifts
from celebrity lines including Jessica Simpson’s.  Net income rose 50 percent to $667 million in the three
months ended Jan. 29, Cincinnati-based Macy’s said in a
statement.  The U.S. recession that began in December 2007 and ended in
June 2009 was the longest since the 43-month slump during the
Great Depression, according to the  National Bureau of Economic
Research .  To contact the reporter on this story:
