Transnet Ltd., the state-owned South
African operator of ports and railways, said it reinstated
Siyabonga Gama to its executive committee after firing him eight
months ago for misconduct.  His reinstatement follows a review of his dismissal for
“certain governance breaches” and will be subject to a final
written warning given that he “was not found guilty of
corruption and/or dishonesty,” Johannesburg-based Transnet said
in an e-mailed statement today. Gama, who was chief executive
officer for Transnet’s freight rail business, may return as
chief operating officer, City Press reported on Feb. 20.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
