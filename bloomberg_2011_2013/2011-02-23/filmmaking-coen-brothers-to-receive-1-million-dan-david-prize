The Dan David Prize, which is
granted in  Tel Aviv , Israel this year will give $1 million to
Joel and Ethan Coen for their “control over the final cut of
their films, their grasp of film genres, black comedy and their
capacity to bring narrative complexity to apparently simple
plots,” a PRNewswire statement said.  Other recipients of the prize, which gives out $3 million
in three separate categories, include Marcus Feldman of  Stanford
University  for his work in evolution as well as Cynthia Kenyon
of the University of California and Gary Ruvkun  of Harvard
Medical School who jointly won for their work on ageing, the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
