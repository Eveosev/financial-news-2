  Reliance Infrastructure Ltd .,
controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani, rose the most in almost
two years after Mint newspaper reported the company expected to
raise 80 billion rupees ($1.8 billion) of debt in a month.  Reliance, which also today began operating an airport rail-
link in New Delhi, surged 12 percent, the most since May 2009,
to close at 696.9 rupees in Mumbai trading. The Mumbai-based
company was the biggest gainer among the 30 stocks on the
benchmark Sensex Index, which fell 0.6 percent.  The fundraising will mean that Reliance has all of the
financing it needs for 25 planned developments, Lalit Jalan,
chief executive officer of the company, said in an interview
published in the Mint today. The company has already raised 300
billion rupees, enough for 22 of the projects, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
