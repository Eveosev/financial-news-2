Bundesbank President  Axel Weber 
indicated the German central bank has raised its forecast for
economic growth this year.  The economy,  Europe ’s largest, will expand “around 2.5
percent,” Weber said at an event in Zurich today. The
Bundesbank’s current growth forecast for 2011 is 2 percent,
while the government predicts 2.3 percent growth.  The economy expanded 3.6 percent last year, the most since
records for a reunified Germany began in 1992, as booming
exports fueled investment, hiring and  consumer spending .
Business confidence jumped to a record high this month and
unemployment last month dropped to the lowest in almost two
decades.  “Germany had astonishing growth last year,” Weber said.
By the end of this year, gross domestic product will reach the
level it was at before the onset of the global financial crisis,
he said.  The Bundesbank will publish its next set of bi-annual
growth and inflation forecasts in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
