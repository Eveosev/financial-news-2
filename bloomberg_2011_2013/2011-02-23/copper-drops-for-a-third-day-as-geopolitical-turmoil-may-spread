Copper declined to the lowest level
in almost a month on concern that escalating geopolitical
tensions may derail the economic recovery. The metal had its
biggest drop in almost seven weeks in  Shanghai .  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange fell for a
third day, dropping as much as 1.3 percent, to $9,459.75 a
metric ton, the lowest level since Jan. 28. It last traded at
$9,468.75 at 2:23 p.m. in  Singapore . All six LME metals
declined, paced by a 1.8 percent drop in nickel.  “Metals are being dragged lower by the  risk aversion  seen
in the other financial markets,” said Li Peiying, an analyst at
Essence Futures Co. “With the oil price suddenly jumping, the
issue of inflation is once again brought to the fore.”  May-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange lost
as much as 2.7 percent, the most since Jan. 7, to 71,580 yuan
($10,883) a ton, the lowest price since Jan. 28, and closed at
71,700. Futures in  New York  fell as much as 1.2 percent to $4.31
a pound, also the lowest since Jan. 28.  Oil traded near the highest level in more than two years,
as violence intensified in  Libya , raising concern that supplies
will be disrupted as turmoil spreads through the Middle East and
North Africa.  “If high oil prices persist, governments around the world
may be more friendly towards raising interest rates,” said
Zhang Xuechuan, an analyst at Huachuang Securities Co. “It’s
the excess of liquidity that drove the recent rally in copper.
Prices could still go higher even after  China  raised interest
rates because monetary policy in the U.S. remains loose.”  China’s central bank on Feb. 18 announced an increase in
reserve requirement ratios for a second time this year, 10 days
after it raised  interest rates  for a third time in four months.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has left its key rate at zero to 0.25
percent since December to support the economy.  Nickel in London decreased 2 percent to $28,080 a ton, zinc
shed 1 percent to $2,464 a ton and lead fell 1.4 percent to
$2,529 a ton. Tin dropped 1.9 percent to $31,051 a ton and
aluminum slipped 0.7 percent to $2,510 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
