Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. settled
the price of naphtha supplies to  Asia  for the year from April,
according to two buyers involved in the negotiations.  The company set its Splitter naphtha at a premium of $17.50
a metric ton to Middle East benchmark prices, the people said,
declining to be identified because the talks were confidential.
Buyers accepted Adnoc’s Low-Sulfur grade at $18.50 a ton and
Pentane-Plus naphtha at $20 a ton, they said. An Adnoc official
in the company’s media relations department declined to comment
when contacted by phone.  The state-run producer in the capital of the  United Arab
Emirates  offers term cargoes in annual contracts starting from
January, April and July. Last year the company offered naphtha
for supply starting from October for the first time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
