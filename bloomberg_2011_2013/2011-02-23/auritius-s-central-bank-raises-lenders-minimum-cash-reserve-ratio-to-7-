Mauritius’s central bank increased
its minimum  cash reserve ratio  to 7 percent from 6 percent,
effective Feb. 25, it said in a statement published on its
website today.  The ratio has been raised “taking into account the
continued high excess liquidity in the system,” the Port Louis-
based bank said. The requirement means lenders need to maintain
cash balances at the Bank of Mauritius equal to 7 percent of
their average deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
