The Polish zloty had its longest
streak of declines since August and the forint slipped to the
weakest in more than three weeks as  Libya ’s uprising pushed the
price of oil toward $100 a barrel in  New York .  The zloty declined 0.3 percent to 3.9772 per euro as of
4:15 p.m. in Warsaw, the lowest level since Dec. 29. The
Hungarian forint dropped 0.3 percent to 273.60 against the
common European currency, its fourth day of losses.  Crude for April delivery climbed as high as $97.97 a barrel
in New York after Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  vowed to keep
fighting the rebellion in the country, Africa’s third-biggest
oil supplier. Stocks retreated.  “With all central and east European countries being net
oil importers, the adverse economic impact of oil prices will
quickly be felt via deterioration in the current account,”  Elisabeth Gruie , an emerging-market strategist at BNP Paribas SA
in London wrote in a report to clients. “The zloty would be
most at risk from a sustained rally in  oil prices .”  Poland’s current account deficit nearly doubled from a year
earlier to 1.57 billion euros ($2.16 billion) in December as
faster economic growth boosted demand, the central bank said on
Feb. 11.  BNP is recommending investors buy the euro against “the
basket” composed 50 percent of the zloty, and 25 percent each
the forint and the Czech koruna, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
