  Peru ’s sol dropped for a fourth day
after metal prices fell on speculation violence in North Africa
and the Middle East will slow global growth.  The sol depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.7870 per  U.S. dollar 
at 1:37 p.m. New York time, from 2.7805 yesterday. The currency
last fell for four straight days in the period ending Nov. 30.  Copper fell to a four-week low, while lead and nickel
prices also declined as Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  vowed to
fight a growing rebellion until his “last drop of blood.”
Mineral exports account for almost two-thirds of Peru’s overseas
sales. Crude oil climbed to $100 a barrel for the first time in
two years.  “Commodity prices, especially metals, are coming down, and
that’s a good excuse to cover short dollar positions,” said  Pedro Tuesta , a senior economist in Washington with 4cast Inc.
“Growth will slow with higher oil costs, and that affects
commodity exporters.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 6.1 percent, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit.  The central bank didn’t buy dollars in the foreign exchange
market today or issue certificates of deposit payable in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
