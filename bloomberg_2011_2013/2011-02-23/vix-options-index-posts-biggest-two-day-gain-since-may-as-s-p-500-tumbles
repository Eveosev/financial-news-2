The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options had its biggest two-day increase in nine months as
equities fell on surging  oil prices  and a profit forecast from
Hewlett-Packard Co. that trailed estimates.  The VIX, as the  Chicago  Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, rose 6.4 percent to 22.13, the highest level
since Nov. 30, at 4:15 p.m. in New York. The gauge has risen 35
percent this week, the most since May. Intraday it gained as
much as 41 percent, the most since the two days started May 6,
when equities lost $862 billion in market value in about 20
minutes before recovering their losses. The VIX measures the
cost of using options as insurance against declines in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which lost 0.6 percent to 1,307.40.  Options prices had declined after the  S&P 500 ’s 31 percent
surge between July 2 and Feb. 18 helped sap demand for
protection from losses. The rally occurred as price swings
narrowed, also driving down options. When the VIX dropped to
15.45 in December, it sank to a level last seen in July 2007, a
month before BNP Paribas SA barred withdrawals from funds that
owned subprime loans and intensified the financial crisis.  “The VIX is a gauge of uncertainty or fear in the
market,” said Luke Rahbari, a VIX options trader and managing
partner at Stutland Equities LLC on the CBOE floor in Chicago.
“With the uncertainty in the market right now, it’s probably
warranted that people are trying to buy protection.”  Oil, Stocks  Oil rallied today, touching $100 a barrel in New York for
the first time since October 2008, as Libya’s uprising
threatened to halt exports. Stocks fell amid concern higher
energy costs will slow economic growth.  Hewlett-Packard Co .,
which reported earnings yesterday, had the biggest loss in the
U.S. after its forecasts trailed analysts’ estimates.  The most-active VIX options were the March 25 calls, which
accounted for almost one-sixth of all call volume and gained 33
percent to $1.60. VIX March futures advanced 5.2 percent to
22.25.  In  Europe , the benchmark gauge of stock-market volatility
jumped for a third consecutive day. The  VStoxx Index , which
measures the cost of protecting against a decline in shares on
the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, increased 4.4 percent to 24.99 in  Frankfurt . The Euro Stoxx 50 stock index fell 1 percent to
2,954.92.  To contact the reporter on this story:
