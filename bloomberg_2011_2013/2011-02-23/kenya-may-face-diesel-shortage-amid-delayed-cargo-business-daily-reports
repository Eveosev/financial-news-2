Kenya may face a diesel shortage
because imports have been delayed, Business Daily reported,
citing Jimmy Mugerwa, chairman of  Kenya  Shell.  A consignment of 56,500 metric tons of the fuel that had
been scheduled to be delivered to the East African country on
Feb. 18 hasnâ€™t arrived yet, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.
The National Oil Corp. of Kenya, or Nock, will announce on Feb.
25 when the shipment will arrive, it said.  Nock is under contract by the government to deliver another
cargo of 59,736 tons of diesel by March 3, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
