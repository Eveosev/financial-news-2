Corn and wheat slumped for a third
day on speculation that protests in North Africa and the Middle
East may slow global growth, reducing demand for crops. Rice
tumbled to the lowest level in more than five weeks  May-delivery corn fell as much as 1.3 percent to $6.81 a
bushel, the lowest level for the most-active contract on the
Chicago Board of Trade since Feb. 9. It was at $6.8475 at 3:23
p.m. Singapore time. The grain dropped by the exchange’s 30-cent
limit yesterday after touching $7.4425, the highest price since
July 2008.  Higher costs of wheat, sugar and dairy products sent the  United Nations ’ World Food Price Index to an all-time high last
month. Protesters clashed with government forces yesterday in  Libya , where more than 200 people have been killed,  Human Rights
Watch  said. In the past month, popular uprisings toppled regimes
in Tunisia and  Egypt , the world’s largest wheat buyer.  Escalating violence in Libya after Tunisia and Egypt
“would have a negative impact on the global economic recovery
and slow demand for food grains for now,” said  Kazuhiko Saito ,
an analyst at Tokyo-based broker Fujitomi Co. “When this kind
of unrest calms down, the market will find support as demand for
grains will increase from this area to curb food inflation.”  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  appeared on state television
yesterday vowing to fight the growing rebellion until his “last
drop of blood.” Diplomats have resigned and soldiers deserted
in protest over a crackdown on anti-government demonstrators
that has left hundreds dead.  Wheat for May delivery fell as much as 1.4 percent to $7.85
a bushel, the lowest price for the most-active contract since
Jan. 20, and last traded at $7.9225. The grain dropped by the
exchange’s 60-cent limit yesterday.  Rice for May delivery plunged as much as 4.3 percent to
$13.945 per 100 pounds, the lowest level for the most-active
contract since Jan. 14. The contract last traded at $14.07 after
sinking by the bourse’s 50-cent daily limit yesterday.  Soybeans for May delivery rose as much as 1.1 percent to
$13.25 a bushel. The oilseed last traded at $13.16 after earlier
slipping 0.3 percent to $13.0775, the lowest level for the most-
active contract since Dec. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
