Global box-office receipts reached
an all-time high in 2010, climbing 8 percent to $31.8 billion,
the industry’s U.S. trade group said.  Theatrical revenue in the U.S. and  Canada  was little
changed at $10.6 billion, the  Motion Picture Association of
America  said today in an e-mailed statement. Sales outside North
America rose 13 percent, led by China and other countries in
Asia.  Viewings in 3-D accounted for $2.2 billion, or 21 percent,
of domestic revenue, double last year’s share. Sales in the
three-dimensional format, which generates about an extra $3 per
ticket, offset a 5 percent drop in attendance to 1.34 billion.
The Asia-Pacific box office surged 21 percent, the MPAA said.  “It was a strong year at the movies in 2010,” Bob Pisano,
president and interim chief executive officer of the MPAA, said
in the statement. “Despite a weak economy, shifting business
models, and the ongoing impact of digital theft, we had another
record year at the global box office driven by growth outside
the U.S. and Canada.”  The MPAA represents  Walt Disney Co ., Viacom Inc.’s
Paramount Pictures,  Sony Corp ., News Corp., NBC Universal and  Time Warner Inc .’s Warner Bros., according to the association’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
