  Lloyds Banking Group Plc , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, will probably report its first full-
year profit since the acquisition of HBOS Plc forced the lender
to seek a bailout from British taxpayers.  Chief Executive Officer  Eric Daniels , presenting his last
results, may say pretax profit rose to 1.78 billion pounds
($2.88 billion), as provisions for loan losses dropped by almost
half, according to the median estimate of 21 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Lloyds posted a pretax loss of 6.3 billion pounds
for 2009 and a 6.7 billion-pound loss for 2008. Antonio Horta- Osorio will take over as CEO on March 1.  “If the numbers come in on target, Daniels will be leaving
on a high note having turned around the group from a fairly ugly
situation with the HBOS losses,” said Joseph Dickerson, an
analyst at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in  London .  Lloyds, 41 percent taxpayer owned, benefitted from a
decline in house repossessions last year and a reduction in the
number of people falling behind on mortgage payments. Total
writedowns soared to 24 billion pounds following the group’s
government-brokered purchase of HBOS, then the country’s biggest
mortgage provider, at the height of the credit crisis in 2008.
The bank halted dividend payments and hasn’t yet resumed them.  Provisions may fall to 13.5 billion pounds in the 12 months
to Dec. 31, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit at the consumer banking unit will
more than triple to 4.63 billion pounds in 2010 from a year
earlier, according to a separate survey of four analysts. The
bank will report earnings in London at 7 a.m. on Feb. 25.  Irish Bad Loans  Lloyds said in December it expects to more than double its
Irish bad-loan charge to about 4.3 billion pounds in the second
half of 2010 following a “significant” worsening of conditions
in the country. On Feb. 21, the bank said that it will make a
500 million-pound provision to cover payments it’s making to
Halifax mortgage clients because the terms of their loans were
unclear.  The bank’s shares rose 30 percent in 2010, making the
lender the second-best performing stock in the FTSE 350 Index of
Britain’s five biggest lenders. Lloyds gained 0.9 percent to
66.87 pence at 10:12 a.m. in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
