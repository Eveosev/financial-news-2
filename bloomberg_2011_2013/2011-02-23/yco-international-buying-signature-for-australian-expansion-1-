  Tyco International Ltd ., the world’s
largest maker of security systems, agreed to buy Signature
Security Group for A$171 million ($171.4 million) from Oceania
Capital Partners Ltd. to expand in  Australia  and  New Zealand .  Signature’s operations in those countries will be folded
into Tyco’s ADT security business, according to a statement
today. Schaffhausen, Switzerland-based Tyco said the deal should
close in its fiscal third quarter, which starts April 1.  Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen is sharpening Tyco’s focus
on its security, fire and flow-control units and said Nov. 9 he
would sell a majority stake in its electrical and metal products
unit to buyout firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC. Sydney-based
Signature provides security installation and monitoring services
and has annualized revenue of about A$80 million.  “It’s in line with the strategy to grow the three core
platforms,” Ajay Kejriwal, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets
in  New York , said today in an interview. He recommends buying
Tyco.  Signature has more than 400 workers and is the third-
largest electronic security company in Australia and the biggest
in New Zealand, according to Sydney-based Oceania’s  website.   Tyco fell $1.51, or 3.3 percent, to $44.65 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares climbed 27
percent in the past 12 months.  The ADT business is Tyco’s largest by sales, with 2010
revenue of $7.38 billion and about 9 million customers. Tyco’s
sales totaled $17 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept.
