Consumers in  Greece  spent as much as
25 percent less during this year’s winter sales period,  Imerisia 
reported, citing Nikolaos Giannetos, a member of the  Athens
Trading Association  board.  Most stores saw revenue decline between 20 and 30 percent
which may lead to closures, Athens-based Imerisia cited
Giannetos as saying.  Many shops in Athens won’t open during normal business
hours today to show support for Greece’s two biggest union
groups, GSEE and ADEDY, which are staging a 24-hour strike, the
newspaper said.  GSEE and ADEDY are staging protest rallies today in
opposition to government measures to trim the public sector and
relax  labor laws  for private companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
