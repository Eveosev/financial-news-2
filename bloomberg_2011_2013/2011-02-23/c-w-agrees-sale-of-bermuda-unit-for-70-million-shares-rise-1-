  Cable & Wireless Communications Plc ,
the U.K. telecommunications company with operations in Panama
and the Caribbean, said it agreed to sell Cable & Wireless  Bermuda  to  Canada ’s The Bragg Group for $70 million. The shares
rose the most since May 2003.  The sale is in line with C&W Communication’s strategy to
focus on full-service telecommunications operations in regional
hubs, the company said in an e-mailed statement today. The
company said two weeks ago it had agreed to acquire 51 percent
of Bahamas Telecommunications Company for $210 million. BTC is
the leading mobile-phone, fixed-line and broadband operator in
the Bahamas  “Bermuda does not fit our business model as it is not a
full-service operation while BTC provides excellent
opportunities and a strong strategic fit with our Caribbean
business,” Chief Executive Officer Tony Rice said in the
statement.  The price of $70 million represents a multiple of 6.5 times
2009/2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, the company said. The sale is subject to
regulatory approval and should be completed by the end of March.  Cable & Wireless Communications rose as much as 5.1 pence,
or 11 percent, to 51.55 pence, the most since May 16, 2003. It
traded at 50.2 pence at 10:50 a.m. in  London , giving the company
a market value of 1.3 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
