The  Federal Reserve  revised a rule
related to home mortgage loan escrow account requirements and
sought comment on a second proposed regulation change.  The Fed increased the annual percentage rate threshold for
requiring a mortgage lender to create an escrow account for
property taxes and insurance for so-called first-lien, “jumbo”
loans, the U.S. central bank said in a statement today. The
escrow rule will apply to first-lien jumbo loans if their annual
percentage rate is at least 2.5 percentage points higher than
the average prime offer rate, the statement said.  The central bank is also proposing expanding the minimum
period for mandatory escrow accounts for first-lien, higher-
priced mortgages to five years from one year, the statement
said. The timeframe could be longer “under certain
circumstances, such as when the loan is delinquent or in
default,” according to the Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
