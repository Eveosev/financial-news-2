  South Africa  may cut its estimate
for the national winter-wheat crop, a survey showed.  The government may say farmers will reap 1.5 million metric
tons of the grain, down from the 1.51 million tons projected
last month, according to the median estimate of 10 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Forecasts ranged from 1.4 million to
1.52 million tons.  The governmentâ€™s  Crop Estimates Committee  is scheduled to
release its seventh forecast for the winter crop tomorrow at
3:30 p.m. Johannesburg time.  Wheat for March delivery, the most active contract on the
South African Futures Exchange, fell by the daily limit of 100
rand, or 3 percent, to close at 3,181 rand ($449) a ton today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
