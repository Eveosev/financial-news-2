The U.S. Federal Reserve shouldn’t
hurry to tighten monetary policy, although growth prospects are
improving, according to  Charles Evans , the president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Financial Times reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Evans, who is a member
of the rate-setting federal open-market committee this year,
said inflation is still low and monetary policy should remain
relaxed until the risk of a “liquidity trap” diminishes.  He said he wouldn’t favor a policy tightening until there
is robust demand growth, led by consumer spending and business
investment, and evidence that companies are taking on more
staff, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
