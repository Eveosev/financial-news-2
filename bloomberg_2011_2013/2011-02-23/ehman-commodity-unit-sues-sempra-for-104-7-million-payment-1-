  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc .’s
commodity services unit sued Sempra Energy Trading LLC claiming
it’s owed $104.7 million, according to a filing in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  Sempra has refused to pay Lehman Brothers Commodity
Services Inc. by asserting “unlawful” setoffs of money owed to
a Sempra affiliate and two banks, Lehman alleged in a complaint
filed today. Sempra can’t avoid payment by using the alleged
claims of separate entities, according to the complaint.  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman
filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Sept. 15, 2008,
with assets of $639 billion. New York-based Lehman published a
revised liquidation plan on Jan. 25 after hedge fund Paulson &
Co. and other creditors challenged an earlier proposal.  Representatives of  Sempra Energy  Trading, based in
Stamford, Connecticut, couldn’t be reached after regular
business hours.  The case is Lehman Brothers Commodity Services v. Sempra
Energy Trading LLC, 11-1502, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
