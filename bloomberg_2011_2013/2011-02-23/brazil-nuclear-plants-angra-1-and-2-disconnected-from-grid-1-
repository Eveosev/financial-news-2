Eletrobras Termonuclear SA ,  Brazil ’s
state-run nuclear-power producer, disconnected its Angra 1 and
Angra 2 nuclear power plants from the national grid after
equipment failures in the past two days.  Eletronuclear, as the company is known, halted its Angra 2
reactor in Rio de Janeiro state on Feb. 22 after problems
occurred in the system that measures steam pressure and
equipment that connects the reactor to the grid, the company
said in a statement. The Angra 1 reactor was also halted because
of a steam pressure failure.  "Equipment failures sometimes happen, but there’s no need
to worry because our maintenance program is up to date," Antonio
Carlos Mazzaro, superintendent of the Angra 2 plant, said today
in a telephone interview from Angra dos Reis, Brazil.  The power grid operator re-routed 700 megawatts of energy
from Brazil’s Southern region to supply the Southeast and also
started up four thermal plants to add an additional 600
megawatts of energy until operations at the nuclear plants are
restored. Energy shortages because of the failure are unlikely,
according to the operator’s press office.  Eletronuclear expects Angra 1 to restart operations tonight
and Angra 2 will resume tomorrow evening, Mazzaro said.
Eletronuclear is a unit of Brazil’s state-controlled  Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA , Latin America’s largest utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
