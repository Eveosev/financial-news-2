Nuevo Grupo Aeronautico, the holding
company that controls bankrupt airline  Cia. Mexicana de
Aviacion , expects to get $200 million from three investors once
it receives approvals from government regulators.  The company, whose controlling shares were acquired
yesterday by PC Capital SAPI, will liquidate its pre-bankruptcy
workforce and restart operations in the days following the
investment, the airline said yesterday in a statement.  Alejo Peralta Teran, Ruben Vila Garciasordo and Alejandro
Ampudia Marco will supply the new funding, joining PC Capital as
investors in Mexicana, the company said. A foreign investor also
plans to join in the next few weeks, it said, without providing
details.  Peralta, Vila and Ampudia are all Mexican investors,
according to Mexico City’s  Excelsior  newspaper.  The airline eventually expects to hire back about 4,000
workers, it said.  Cia. Mexicana de Aviacion filed for bankruptcy protection
in  Mexico  in August, sought Chapter 15 protection in the U.S.,
and halted its operations. The Chapter 15 petition in  New York 
listed more than $500 million in assets and $1 billion in debt.  Before its bankruptcy, Mexicana was the nation’s largest
carrier and flew to more than 65 national and international
destinations, including the U.S., Canada, Europe and  South
America . In 2009, it transported 6.86 million passengers, while
its Click and Link subsidiaries carried an additional 4.25
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
