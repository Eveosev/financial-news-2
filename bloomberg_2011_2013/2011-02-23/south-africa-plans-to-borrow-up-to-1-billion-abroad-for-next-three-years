  South Africa ’s National Treasury
will issue foreign bonds each year for the next three years and
raised its forecast for domestic loans for 2011-12 to help fund
a higher than expected budget deficit.  “Over the medium-term, government intends to borrow about
$1 billion a year in global markets to maintain benchmarks in
major currencies and meet part of its foreign currency
commitments,” the Treasury said in its Budget Review released
in Parliament in  Cape Town  today.  The Treasury forecast a fiscal deficit of 5.3 percent of
gross domestic product for the fiscal year through March 2012,
compared with an estimate in October of 4.6 percent. It scrapped
plans to issue 14.4 billion rand ($2 billion) of foreign bonds
this year after selling $2 billion of 6.875 percent fixed-rate
international bonds due May 27, 2019, in the previous fiscal
year.  The budget provides for 7.15 billion rand to be raised
abroad in the fiscal year through March 2012, 7.87 billion rand
the following year and 8.69 billion rand the year after that.  The government will sell 150.4 billion rand of long-term
domestic debt in 2011-12 and 150.7 billion rand in 2012-13, the
Treasury said. A further 22 billion rand will be raised in
treasury bills in each of the next two years.  In October, it had expected to sell 143.9 billion in
domestic bonds in 2011-12 and 138.8 billion rand the following
year.  Debt to Rise  The public-sector borrowing requirement, which includes
state-owned companies, will be 281.2 billion rand this year, or
10.5 percent of GDP, compared with October’s estimate of 272
billion rand, the Treasury said. Borrowing will ease to 276.4
billion next year, 260.1 billion in 2012-13 and 222 billion rand
the following year.  “National government debt is set to rise from 526 billion
rand at the end of 2008-09 to over 1.3 trillion rand in 2013-
14,” Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said in his budget speech.
“Government debt needs to be managed sustainably. We don’t want
an unsustainable increase in expenditure, nor do we want the
severe austerity measures some Western counties have to adopt.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
