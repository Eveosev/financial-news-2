Two Bulgarian planes evacuated 184
Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian, Romanian, Macedonian and Chinese
citizens from the Libyan capital Tripoli as violence worsens in
the North African country.  The planes arrived in Sofia today, Bulgarian Prime Minister  Boiko Borissov  told reporters in Sofia. Some 1,500 Bulgarian
doctors, nurses and engineers work in  Libya , according to the
Foreign Ministry. The two planes picked up all Bulgarians who
had managed to get to the Tripoli airport, the ministry said.  The ministry advised its citizens living in Libyaâ€™s second
biggest city Benghazi, where the airport is closed, to leave the
country by ships sent by other European Union nations. Benghazi
is controlled by rebels fighting to topple  Muammar Qaddafi , who
has ruled the country for 41 years.  Five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who had been
sentenced to death were freed in 2007 after eight years in a
Libyan prison with EU help.  To contact the reporter of this story:
