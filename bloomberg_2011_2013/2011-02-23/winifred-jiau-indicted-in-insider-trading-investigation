Winifred Jiau, a former consultant
to  Primary Global Research LLC , pleaded not guilty to conspiracy
and  securities-fraud  charges as part of an insider-trading
investigation.  Jiau, 43, passed inside information on to an unnamed hedge
fund portfolio manager and to Noah Freeman, the Boston hedge
fund manager who pleaded guilty Feb. 7 to securities fraud,
prosecutors said in an indictment made public earlier today in
federal court in New York.  Jiau passed tips on  Nvidia Corp . and Marvell Technology
Group Ltd. to the two men, according to the indictment. She was
paid as much as $10,000 a month in return. Jiau, who is being
held in a federal jail in Manhattan, was originally charged Dec.
29 in a criminal complaint.  Her lawyer, Frederick Hafetz, declined to comment on the
indictment.  The case is U.S. v. Jiau, 10-mj-02900, U.S. District Court,
