U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  urged Americans to leave Libya immediately and said the
U.S. will examine “all possible options” to respond to the
violence of the Qaddafi regime.  “Everything will be on the table,” Clinton told reporters
at a joint news conference today at the State Department in
Washington with Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota.  Before taking punitive measures such as economic sanctions,
Clinton said, the U.S. wants to consult with other countries to
better evaluate a “fluid” and “uncertain” situation in
Libya.  “First, we have to get the international community
together,” Clinton said.  She urged Americans in Libya “to depart immediately” and
to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance if needed.  Patriota said he is “fairly encouraged” that  Brazil  will
be able to help its citizens who wish to leave the country. Some
Brazilians are in the North African country doing work to
enlarge the airport in Tripoli, the capital, he said.  “This is a moment of crisis, but also of opportunity,” in
the Arab and Islamic world, he added.  Patriota said he discussed Iran with Clinton. Brazil is
seeking to reduce distrust between  Iran  and some United Nations
Security Council members, he said.  A U.S.-chartered ferry was prepared to take American
citizens from the Libyan capital to the island of  Malta . It was
not clear when the ferry would depart.  To contact the reporters on this story:
