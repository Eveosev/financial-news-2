A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the owner
of the largest container line, posted the second-highest annual
profit in its 106-year history as growth returned to the market.  Net income reached 26.5 billion kroner ($4.9 billion) in
2010, compared with a record loss of 7.03 billion kroner a year
earlier, the Copenhagen-based company said today in a statement.
Profit compared with the 26.3 billion-krone average estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts. Sales rose 21 percent to 315
billion kroner.  Maersk, which this week ordered 10 of the world’s largest
container ships, said today that the container market will
expand by as much as 8 percent this year. The company,  Denmark ’s
biggest, said profit this year won’t match the level of last
year, when the container market expanded by 13 percent.  “The company issued a cautious outlook for 2011, which was
expected, and which is in line with former patterns of a usually
conservative guidance,” Axel Funhoff, an analyst at ING Equity
Research in Brussels who advises buying the shares, wrote in a
note. “There is a lot of uncertainty at this point in time
regarding the direction of container freight rates into 2011.”  Maersk rose as much as 3.5 percent, and advanced 1,450
kroner, or 2.8 percent, to 53,250 kroner as of 10:09 a.m. in
Copenhagen. The shares have gained 5.4 percent this year,
compared with a 3.3 percent advance in the Bloomberg European
500 Index.  World trade will probably expand by 7 percent this year,
compared with more than 11 percent in 2010 and the average 5.7
percent rate during the last three decades, according to
International Monetary Fund data compiled by Bloomberg.    Maersk Line   Maersk’s container operations, which include Maersk Line,
generated net income of 14.9 billion kroner last year, compared
with an 11.4 billion-krone loss a year earlier. Maersk
transported the equivalent of 7.3 million 40-foot containers, 5
percent more a year earlier, though less than the 13 percent
expansion of the global market, Maersk said. Rates were 29
percent higher on average last year, including fuel surcharges,
the company said.  Maersk’s market share, which declined last year, will
“stabilize or maybe grow” this year, Chief Executive Officer
Nils Smedegaard Andersen said today in a Bloomberg television
interview. The company has improved its financial strength and
is ready to make investments, focusing on purchases for its oil
unit, the rig business and the port terminal division, he said.  Biggest Ships  The company on Feb. 21 agreed to buy ships for as much as
$5.4 billion from Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.,
in a deal that includes 10 vessels with an option for an
additional 20. The ships will be the biggest of their kind and
can each carry 18,000 containers, enough for 18 million flat-
panel televisions.  Maersk’s oil-and-gas unit, the Nordic region’s second-
largest explorer after  Statoil ASA , said 2010 net income rose to
9.33 billion kroner from 6.24 billion kroner a year earlier. The
division was helped by  oil prices  that were on average 29
percent higher last year, Maersk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
