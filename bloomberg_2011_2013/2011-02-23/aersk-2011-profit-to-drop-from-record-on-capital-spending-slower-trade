A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, Denmark’s
biggest company, said it expects 2011 profit after tax to be
“lower” than the 2010 result.  Cash flow from operating activities is expected to develop
in line with the result, while  cash flow  used for capital
expenditure is expected to be significantly higher than in 2010,
Maersk said.  Copenhagen-based Maersk, owner of the world’s biggest
container line, published its earnings report in a stock-
exchange statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
