The  National Football League 
scheduled a meeting at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis tomorrow
to update coaches and general managers on labor negotiations,
the league said.  The NFL’s collective bargaining agreement with its players
 union  expires March 3. The union says the league plans to lock
players out; the league says it wants an agreement. Both sides
have been meeting with a mediator since Feb. 18. The talks
aren’t binding and either side could walk away.  The combine, where college players are tested before the  NFL draft  in April, gives the league a chance to address team
personnel in one place.  Team owners voted in 2008 to opt out of the collective
bargaining agreement with players two years early, saying the
deal didn’t account for costs such as those of building
stadiums.  The NFL and the union are arguing about how to share almost
$9 billion in league revenue. Owners want to double the $1
billion they take out to cover expenses before dividing the
remainder with players, according to the NFL Players
Association.  Other areas of dispute include rookie salary scales, the
addition of two regular-season games and health care for
players.  To contact the reporter on this story:
