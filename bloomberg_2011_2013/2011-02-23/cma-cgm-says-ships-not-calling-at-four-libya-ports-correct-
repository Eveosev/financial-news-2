CMA CGM SA, the world’s third-
largest container shipping line, said its vessels aren’t calling
at four Libyan ports.  “CMA CGM ships’ calls at Libyan ports, Benghazi, Misurata,
Khoms and Tripoli, are temporarily suspended,” the company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The company, which is represented by agent OSCL locally,
created an emergency response team to monitor the situation.  “CMA CGM continues to accept bookings to  Libya , excluding
reefer and hazardous cargo bookings that are temporarily
suspended until further notice,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
