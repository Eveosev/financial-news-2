Asia gasoline fell as Morgan Stanley
sold cargoes in  Singapore , the region’s biggest oil-trading and
storage center. Gasoil slipped into a discount.  Light Distillates  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline for loading from Singapore
dropped 35 cents to $112.40 a barrel, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan
declined $6, or 0.7 percent, to $917.50 a metric ton.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha rebounded to $12.15 a barrel
from $11.80 yesterday, based on Bloomberg calculations. A
widening reforming margin shows the motor fuel is more
profitable to produce compared with naphtha.  Morgan Stanley sold 50,000 barrels of 88-RON gasoline to
Pertamina Energy Services Ltd., the first transaction for this
grade since July 27, traders said. The price was 88 cents a
barrel below quotes for 92-RON grade. Morgan Stanley also sold a
92-RON cargo to BP Plc at $112.45 a barrel.  Vitol Group sold an open-specification naphtha contract for
second-half April delivery to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $918.50 a
ton, traders said.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to  Brent crude  fell
to $110.46 a ton from $126.55 at the end of Asian trading
yesterday, Bloomberg data showed. A narrowing crack spread
indicates reduced profit from making the petrochemical
feedstock.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur fell 35 cents to
$119.95 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Jet
fuel dropped 80 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $123.05.  Gasoil slipped into a discount after Singapore Petroleum
Co. sold 150,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur grade to Cargill
Inc. at 9 cents a barrel below benchmark quotes, traders said.
Yesterday, the product changed hands at parity to quotes.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude decreased 21 cents to
$17.17 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM Oil
Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure of refining
profit, was at the narrowest since Feb. 1.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising
yesterday to $3.30 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade has more
than doubled in the past week, indicating  aviation fuel  is more
profitable than diesel.    Fuel Oil   The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade fell after Hin Leong Trading Pte bought three 380-
centistoke grade cargoes in the  spot market .  The price gap, or the viscosity spread, fell to $12.75 a
ton from $14.75 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Asian benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil fell 25 cents to
$629 a ton and the price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used
as marine fuel, rose 0.3 percent to $616.25.  Hin Leong bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke
fuel oil from Vitol at a premium of $10 a ton to Singapore fuel
oil assessments for loading between March 15 and March 19, said
two traders. It bought another 20,000 tons from PetroChina Co.
at $10.50 a ton over the assessments for loading from March 21
to March 15.  Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd., a Chinese marine fuel
supplier, plans to open offices in  London  and Geneva to increase
trading of oil products, according to a statement filed to the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Refinery News  Yeochun NCC Co.,  South Korea ’s biggest ethylene producer,
aims to resume operations at a naphtha cracker today that was
shut following a power disruption, according to a company
official. The No. 1 plant south of  Seoul , which is able to make
857,000 tons of ethylene a year from naphtha, was halted
yesterday, said the official, who declined to be identified
because of corporate policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
