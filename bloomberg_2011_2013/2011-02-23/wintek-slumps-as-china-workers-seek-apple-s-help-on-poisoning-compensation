  Wintek Corp . dropped the most in 1
1/2 months in Taipei trading after Reuters reported workers at a
Wintek factory in  China  wrote a letter to Apple Inc. urging the
U.S. company to help address their grievances over chemical
poisoning.  Wintek, which supplies touch sensors to Apple’s iPads, lost
3.9 percent to NT$52.20 as of 10:54 a.m., set for the biggest
decline since Dec. 29.  “There’s concern among investors that Apple may change its
supplier,” Chia-lin Lu, an analyst at Samsung Securities Asia
Co., said by telephone in Hong Kong. “This is a trigger for
Wintek shares to fall.”  The letter alleged workers had been harmed by a chemical
called hexyl hydride, used in manufacturing touch screens for
Apple products. Wintek has since gone back to using alcohol and
workers who needed medical care had been treated, Reuters
reported, citing Wintek Chief Financial Officer Jay Huang.  Taichung, Taiwan-based Wintek has paid about 10 million
yuan ($1.5 million) to 91 workers poisoned by the chemicals and
may make additional payments, Huang told Bloomberg News in a
phone interview today. “We’re willing to discuss it case by
case,” he said.  Huang said he’s not heard of any letters being sent by
employees to Apple asking for assistance. Jill Tan, an Apple
spokeswoman, didn’t answer two calls to her  Hong Kong  mobile
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
