  RWE AG , Germanyâ€™s second-biggest
utility, sold power at below the market price in an auction to
industrial customers.  The Essen-based company sold next-year baseload power for
52.90 euros ($72.82) a megawatt-hour today,  Michael Rosen ,  a
company spokesman, said by e-mail. RWE holds auctions to sell
electricity generated at lignite and hard-coal plants to
industrial clients. The next auction will be held on April 14,
he said.  The baseload product closed at 53.54 euros yesterday on the
European Energy Exchange AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
