  Serbia ’s state-run power monopoly
Elektroprivreda Srbije plans to develop 50 small hydro plants in
the country and expects a 45 million euro ($61.7 million) loan
from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for
the project, the B92 website reported today, citing  EPS ’s
general manager.  The loan, backed by a Serbian state guarantee, would be
used for “mini-facilities” on the Katusnica, Rzav and Ribnica
rivers in central and western Serbia, boosting generation from
renewable sources, the report cited Dragomir Markovic as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
