  Ford Motor Co . said it is recalling
144,000 F-150 pickup trucks in the U.S. and  Canada  because front
air bags may deploy when not needed.  The recall, which applies to model years 2005 and 2006,
follows a request from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration that the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker
recall the vehicles. The F-150 is the top-selling vehicle in the
U.S.  “During assembly, a specific air-bag wire located in the
steering wheel could have been improperly positioned so that it
may chafe, expose bare copper and create the potential for a
short circuit that would illuminate the warning lamp,” Wes
Sherwood, a Ford spokesman, said in an e-mail. “If not
serviced, and unique circumstances occur, an inadvertent driver
frontal airbag deployment may occur.”  NHTSA in 2009 opened an investigation into 1.3 million of
the trucks from model years 2004 to 2006. In a November memo,
NHTSA said it had received reports of 238 unintentional air-bag
deployments causing 77 injuries. Most of the incidents occurred
when the trucks were started.  The recall, which affects vehicles built at Ford’s Norfolk,
Virginia, assembly plant, was reported earlier today by the  Detroit News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
