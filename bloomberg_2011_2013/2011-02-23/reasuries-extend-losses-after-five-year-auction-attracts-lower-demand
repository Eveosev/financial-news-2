Treasuries erased earlier gains
after a $35 billion government auction of five-year debt
attracted lower demand than dealers forecast.  “We had a sloppy auction with the street ending up with
more paper than they would like,” said Larry Milstein, managing
director in  New York  of government and agency debt trading at RW
Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer for
institutional investors. “Oil has come off its highs and stocks
have come off their lows which is allowing rates to rise.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
