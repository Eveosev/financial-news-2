  Telekomunikacja Polska SA , Poland’s
largest phone company, said sales will continue falling this
year on cuts in regulated prices and further decline in fixed-
line revenue, delaying its return to growth by one year.  Sales, which dropped 5.1 percent to 15.7 billion zloty
($5.4 billion) last year, will fall by a range of 2 percent to
4.5 percent in 2011, the Warsaw-based unit of  France Telecom SA 
said in a regulatory statement today.  The communist-era monopolist known as TPSA is fighting a
decline in revenue as Poles abandon fixed-line calls and
regulators slash mobile rates. New price cuts will change the
three-year strategy announced a year ago, meaning sales will be
little changed next year and start growing only in 2013, rather
than 2012, Chief Executive Officer Maciej Witucki said.  The watchdog has yet to decide on the level and timing of
the planned reductions, Witucki said on a conference call today.  TPSA fell 1.1 percent to 16.56 zloty at 10:47 a.m. in
Warsaw trading, bringing its gain for the year to 1.2 percent.
So far this year the benchmark WIG20 index has fallen 3.1
percent and  Netia SA , TPSA’s largest publicly traded competitor,
gained 1 percent.  A 50 percent reduction in prices operators charge for calls
to their mobile networks, known as mobile termination rates or
MTRs, cut TPSA’s 2009 revenue by about 1 billion zloty ($346
million). The prices haven’t been reduced since July 2009, which
allowed the company to increase its mobile segment revenue in
the second half of 2010 compared with a year earlier.  Mobile Revenue  Mobile revenue rose 6.4 percent to 2 billion zloty in the
fourth quarter as the company increased the number of cell-phone
customers by 4.5 percent to 14.3 million, including 5 percent
growth in clients with long-term contracts.  Total sales declined 1.2 percent to 3.96 billion zloty. The
fixed-line business fell by 7 percent and Witucki said it will
continue to decline in 2011 as Telekomunikacja faces increasing
competition from companies like Netia SA.  Fourth-quarter net income fell 13 percent to 218 million
zloty, missing the 246.5 million-zloty estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, TPSA said today.  The company plans to pay a dividend of 1.5 zloty a share
this year, and forecasts net free cash flow for 2011 of at least
2.4 billion zloty.  The ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
and amortization to revenue will be 36 percent to 37 percent in
2011, compared with 37 percent in 2010 adjusted for a 1.06
billion-zloty provision for an arbitration court case lost to
DPTG I/S of Denmark. Unadjusted Ebitda was at 30 percent.  On Sept. 3, the company said it lost a legal case against
DPTG, a subsidiary of GN Store Nord A/S. DPTG, which was awarded
2.9 billion kroner ($532 million) by the arbitration court, in
January filed a 2.4 billion-krone claim concerning another time
period in the same dispute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
