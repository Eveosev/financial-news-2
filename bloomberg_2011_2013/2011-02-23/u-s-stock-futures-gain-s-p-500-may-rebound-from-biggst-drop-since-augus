U.S. stocks fell, dragging benchmark
indexes to the biggest two-day drop in six months, as oil surged
to $100 a barrel amid growing tensions in the Middle East and  Hewlett-Packard Co .’s forecasts trailed analysts’ estimates.  Hewlett-Packard, the largest computer maker, tumbled 9.6
percent.  Ford Motor Co . sank 2.4 percent after announcing a
recall of 144,000 pickup trucks and as a  Supreme Court  ruling
opened the auto industry to new lawsuits over seatbelt design.
Lowe’s Cos. slid 1 percent after forecasting profit that missed
analyst estimates.  Chevron Corp . rose 1.9 percent as oil climbed
to a 28-month high amid escalating violence in Libya.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.6 percent to
1,307.40 as of 4 p.m. in New York and is down 2.7 percent over
the last two days. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slid 107.01
points, or 0.9 percent, to 12,105.78 today. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index, which measures the cost of
using options as insurance against declines in the  S&P 500 ,
jumped 6.4 percent to 22.13, the highest since Nov. 30.  “People are always looking forward and that’s why they are
reacting negatively to the spike in oil prices,” Michael Holland, who oversees more than $4 billion as chairman of
Holland & Co. in  New York . “Higher crude prices may challenge
the outlook for economic growth. So, even as we have better-
than-estimated earnings and economic figures in the U.S., those
are sort of looking at the rear-view mirror.”  Corporate Earnings  The S&P 500 has rallied 4 percent in 2011, extending last
year’s 13 percent gain, as reports showed an improving economy
and corporate profits beat analysts’ estimates for the eighth
straight quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Per-
share earnings have topped estimates at 71 percent of the 424
companies in the gauge that have reported results since Jan. 10,
Bloomberg data showed.  Crude oil prices touched $100 a barrel in New York for the
first time in two years as  Libya ’s uprising threatened to
disrupt crude exports. Heavy gunfire broke out in Tripoli, army
units defected and a former aide to Muammar Qaddafi said the
spreading revolt may topple the regime within days.  Oil prices may surge to $220 a barrel if political unrest
in North Africa halts exports from Libya and Algeria, Nomura
Holdings Inc. said. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries has spare production capacity of about 5 million
barrels a day, according to the  International Energy Agency .
Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said yesterday that the
organization will boost output if there is a shortage.  Better Footing  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the
economic recovery has put the world on a better footing to
withstand the increase in oil prices. U.S. consumer confidence
rose to its highest level in three years this month.  “The economy is in a much stronger position to handle”
rising oil prices, Geithner said today during a Bloomberg
Breakfast in  Washington . “Central banks have a lot of
experience in managing these things.”  Analysts at Morgan Stanley say sharp increases in oil
prices pose the biggest threat to growth because consumers
suffer a sudden hit to purchasing power. They note an 85 percent
to 90 percent increase in the price of oil over a year was
followed by U.S. recessions in 1975, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2008.  “The big picture in the U.S. looks good, but there are
geopolitical issues,” said  Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.5
billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co.
“We had better-than-expected economic figures. However, oil
prices should be a consideration on how we look at the economy
especially if it begins to hurt consumers and businesses.”  Economy Dependent  Industry groups that are more dependent on economic growth
led the declines in the S&P 500. Gauges of industrial makers,
companies that rely on consumer-discretionary spending and
technology stocks slumped at least 1.3 percent.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average tumbled 2.1 percent to
4,986.21, the lowest level since Dec. 1.  United Continental
Holdings Inc . sank 6.8 percent to $22.78, while  FedEx Corp .
declined 4.3 percent to $89.25.  Hewlett-Packard tumbled 9.6 percent to $43.59. Excluding
some costs, profit will be $1.21 a share at most in the second
quarter, HP said yesterday. Sales will be as much as $31.6
billion. That compares with the average analyst predictions of
$1.26 in per-share profit and $32.6 billion in revenue.  Car Companies Tumble  A gauge of car companies in the S&P 500 fell 2.7 percent,
the most within 24 industries. The Supreme Court ruled that
Mazda Motor Corp. must defend against claims pressed by the
family of a woman killed while riding in the back of a minivan.
Justices said that automakers can be sued for not equipping
seats with a shoulder strap and aren’t immunized by a federal
regulation that allowed lap-only belts in some rear seats prior
to 2007.  Ford declined 2.4 percent to $14.86. The automaker said it
is recalling 144,000 F-150  pickup trucks  in the U.S. and  Canada 
because front air bags may deploy when not needed. The recall,
which applies to model years 2005 and 2006, follows a request
from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
that the automaker recall the vehicles. The F-150 is the top-
selling vehicle in the U.S.  Lowe’s dropped 1 percent to $25.73. The home-improvement
retailer forecast first-quarter earnings excluding some items of
as little as 34 cents a share. On average, the analysts in a
Bloomberg survey estimated profit of 38 cents a share.  Bigger rival  Home Depot Inc . slumped 2.1 percent to $37.30.  Energy Shares Rally  Energy shares had the only gain in the S&P 500 among 10
industries, rising 2 percent as a group.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company, rallied
1.9 percent, the most in the Dow average, to $102.27.  Exxon
Mobil Corp . gained 1.9 percent to $87.07.  Stocks maintained losses even after a report showed that
sales of U.S. previously owned homes unexpectedly rose in
January to the highest level in eight months. Purchases
increased 2.7 percent to a 5.36 million annual rate, exceeding
the 5.22 million median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, figures from the National Association of
Realtors showed today in Washington.  “The most encouraging thing I see about the U.S. market is
that the economy is doing better than people thought,”  Byron Wien , the vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Services, told  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt on Bloomberg Radio’s “Bloomberg
Surveillance.” “Earnings are coming through very favorably.
I’m very bullish on the U.S. market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
