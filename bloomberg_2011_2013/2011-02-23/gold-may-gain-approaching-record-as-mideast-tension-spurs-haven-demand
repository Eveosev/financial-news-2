Gold futures rose, capping the
longest rally in six months, as mounting tensions in  Libya  and
the Middle East boosted demand for an investment haven. Silver
climbed to the highest settlement price since 1980.  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has vowed to fight a growing
rebellion until his “last drop of blood.” Gold climbed for the
seventh straight session, the longest advance since early
August. The price reached $1,417.30, a seven-week high. The
metal climbed to a record of $1,432.50 on Dec. 7. Crude oil in
New York climbed to $100 a barrel on Mideast supply concerns.  Gold “will continue to be boosted by geopolitical factors,
inflation threats, and from a return of investment,” Tom Pawlicki, an analyst in  Chicago  at MF Global Holdings Ltd., said
today in a report.  Gold futures for April delivery rose $12.90, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $1,414 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . The price has climbed 28 percent in the past 12
months.  Yesterday, gold held in exchange-traded products fell 4.86
metric tons to 2,014.8 tons, the lowest since June 7, data
compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show. Holdings reached a
record 2,114.6 tons in December.  Gold’s 14-day relative-strength index signaled the price
may be poised to drop, Pawlicki said.  Margin Clerks  “We are concerned that gold could turn lower at a moment’s
notice, especially if the margin clerks begin to take aim upon
the markets and begin to look for liquidity when and where they
can find it,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor
of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 44.8 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $33.304 an ounce, the highest settlement since March
1980. The commodity has more than doubled in the past 12 months.  The metal climbed to an intraday record of $50.35 in
January 1980.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $31.10, or 3.9
percent, to $776.30 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price has jumped 78 percent in the past 12 months.  Platinum futures for April delivery fell $9.60, or 0.5
percent, to $1,776.70 an ounce. The metal has gained 18 percent
in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
