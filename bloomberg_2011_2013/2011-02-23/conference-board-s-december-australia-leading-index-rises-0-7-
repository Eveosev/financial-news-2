An index of Australian leading
economic indicators rose in December as building approvals,
stock prices and agricultural exports improved.  The New York-based Conference Board’s index climbed 0.7
percent to 121.3, after a revised 0.2 percent advance in
November, according to a report released in an e-mailed
statement.  The leading index uses previously reported statistics and
estimates of economic indicators, such as profits and exports,
to predict the pace of growth in coming months. The Conference
Board, a research group, also compiles indexes for the U.S.,
France, Germany, Japan and the U.K.  The index of coincident indicators, which is a gauge of the
current growth rate, was unchanged at 118.3, the report showed.  To contact the reporter for this story:  Michael Heath  in Sydney at
