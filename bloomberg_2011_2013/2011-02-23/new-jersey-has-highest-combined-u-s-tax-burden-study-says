  New Jersey  residents have the
highest state and local tax burden in the nation, a Tax
Foundation  study  said today.  They paid 12.2 percent of their incomes in state and local
taxes in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.  New York  and  Connecticut , the second- and third-highest-burdened states, gave
up 12.1 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Alaskans paid the
least, at 6.3 percent.  The top three were the only ones paying 12 percent or more
in state and local levies. The next-ranked state, Wisconsin,
paid 11 percent. New Jersey, New York and Connecticut have
headed the list since 2005, with New Jersey at No. 1 for the
last three years.  “High levels of spending that require high levels of
taxation” made the states the leaders, the Washington-based  Tax
Foundation  said.  The state and local burden for all U.S. taxpayers fell to
9.8 percent of incomes in 2009 from 9.9 percent the previous
year as taxes shrank faster than earnings because of the
recession, the report said. It’s the first time since 2000 that
the overall burden fell, the foundation said. It was 9.4 percent
in 2000.  The Tax Foundation is a privately funded research
organization that advocates a market-based economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
