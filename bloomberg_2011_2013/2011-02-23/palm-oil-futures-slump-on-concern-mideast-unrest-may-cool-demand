  Palm oil  declined the most in three
months, tracking losses in soybeans and grains which slumped on
speculation that protests in North Africa and the Middle East
may slow global growth, cooling demand for farm commodities.  The May-delivery contract slumped 4.2 percent to 3,514
ringgit ($1,153) on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the
biggest drop since Nov. 22. Prices slid 6.9 percent last week.  Soybeans futures for May delivery plunged by the 70-cent
limit, or 5.1 percent, to $13.11 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade yesterday. That was the lowest level for a most-active
contract since Dec. 20. Soybean oil fell 4.4 percent to 54.62
cents per pound. Corn and wheat slumped for a third day today
and rice tumbled to the lowest level in more than five weeks.  Palm oil “is following yesterday’s drop in soybeans and  soybean oil  in Chicago,” Ryan Long, a dealer at OSK Investment
Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur , said by telephone.  Soybean oil is a substitute for palm oils, and shifts in
soybean and soybean-product prices can influence palm.  Higher costs of wheat, sugar and dairy products sent the
United Nations’ World Food Price Index to an all-time high last
month. Protesters clashed with government forces yesterday in
Libya, where more than 200 people have been killed, Human Rights
Watch said. In the past month, popular uprisings toppled regimes
in Tunisia and Egypt, the world’s largest wheat buyer.  September-delivery palm oil dropped 4.3 percent to 9,316
yuan ($1,417) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  at the
close. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell 4.1
percent to close at 10,040 yuan a ton.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm-oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, lost as much as 5.5 percent to
$1,134.50.  NI TRMKTS  To contact the reporter on this story:
