Xing Yujing, deputy director general
of monetary policy department of the People’s Bank of  China ,
comments on the convertibility of the Chinese currency. She
spoke at a conference in Hong Kong yesterday.  “There is no timetable for the currency convertibility. We
need to look at the actual convertibility of the renminbi. As
the PBOC, we study closely the actual convertibility closely.
Most items that need to be liberalized have been liberalized.”  “If we look at the history and the progress on the
international use of the RMB, we can find that sometimes the
demand goes very quickly. If there is demand from the market in
order to facilitate trade and investment, the change will be
quicker than what we imagined before.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
