Economic sentiment in Cyprus rose
for the first time in three months in February as the service
and construction industries reported improved business and a
brighter outlook, the Economic Research Centre of the  University
of Cyprus  said.  The economic sentiment index increased 5.3 points to 91.2
points, the Centre said in a statement on its website today.
“Although the Economic Sentiment Indicator and economic growth
are on a recovery course, the economic climate appears uncertain
in the short term,” the group said in the  statement .  Economic sentiment among manufacturing companies was
unchanged compared with the previous month, while  consumer
confidence  rose even as consumers forecast major price
increases, the centre said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
