Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index  dropped 345.90, or 0.5 percent, to 64,312.86 at 2:55 p.m.
in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.    Akfen Holding AS  (AKFEN TI), a company with interests in
construction, real estate, tourism and energy, fell 15 kurus, or
1.4 percent, to 10.85 liras, bringing its three days of losses
to 5.7 percent. TAV Insaat, a subsidiary of the company, is a
partner in building new international terminals at the airports
in Tripoli and Sebha, Libya, Akfen said in a statement to the
exchange. Akfen is evacuating personnel from the country until
the situation there stabilizes, it said.    TAV Havalimanlari Holding AS  (TAVHL TI), Turkey’s biggest
airport operator, in which Akfen has a 26 percent stake, dropped
24 kurus, or 3.6 percent, to 6.52 liras.    Turk Hava Yollari  AO (THYAO TI), the national airline known
as Turkish Airlines, dropped 6 kurus, or 1.3 percent, to 4.64
liras. Oil rose to its highest in more than two years as Libya’s
violent uprising threatened to disrupt exports from Africa’s
third-biggest supplier and spread to other crude-producing
nations in the Middle East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
