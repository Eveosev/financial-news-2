  Uganda  canceled voting in local and
mayoral elections in the capital, Kampala, today after
irregularities were cited hours into the ballot, said Paul
Bukenya, deputy spokesman for the  Electoral Commission .  “Irregularities undermined the set procedures” and could
have “resulted in violence,” Bukenya said by phone from
Kampala, without giving details. “We have postponed the
elections in Kampala and we shall set a new date.”  Local elections in the rest of the country proceeded
peacefully, he said.  Stuffed ballot boxes and pre-ticked ballot papers in favor
of the candidate for the ruling National Resistance Movement
were discovered at many polling stations, Michael Mabike, an
opposition candidate, said by phone.  President Yoweri Museveni was reelected with 68.38 percent
of the vote in a Feb. 18 election that was criticized by
international observers and rejected by opposition parties who
said it was marred by voter intimidation and fraud.  To contact the reporter on this story:
