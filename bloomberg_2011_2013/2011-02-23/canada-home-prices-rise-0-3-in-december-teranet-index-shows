Canadian  house prices  rose for the
first time in four months in December, the  Teranet-National Bank 
Composite House Price Index showed.  Prices rose 0.3 percent during the month, according to a
report released today by National Bank Financial, following a
0.2 percent decline in November. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for the index to be unchanged based on the
median of six responses.  “December’s price increases in most metropolitan areas
confirm our call that the previous monthly declines did not
herald a long-lasting correction,” Marc Pinsonneault, senior
economist at National Bank Financial, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
