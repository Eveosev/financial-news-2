Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
regime has a matter days before it falls, Al-Hayat reported,
citing Major Abdel Moneim al-Houni, a former member of Libya’s
revolutionary command council who resigned as the country’s
ambassador to the  Arab League  on Feb. 20.  Houni told the  Saudi-owned newspaper  that Imam Moussa al-
Sadr, chairman of Lebanon’s Shiite Islamic Council, who went
missing on a visit to Libya in August 1978, was killed and
buried in the Sabha region in the southern part of the north
African country. Houni said his brother-in-law, who was the
pilot of Qaddafi’s private plane, was tasked with transporting
Sadr’s to Sabha and was killed himself shortly after doing so to
keep the crime secret.  Lebanon’s examining magistrate issued a summons in 2008 for
Qaddafi to appear for questioning about Sadr. Relations between
Libya and Lebanon were strained by the disappearance of the
cleric and two of his aides.  Libya  has always maintained that
Sadr left the country to Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
