U.S. stock futures erased gains as
oil rallied amid concern  Libya ’s uprising will disrupt exports
from Africa’s third-largest supplier of crude.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less
than 0.1 percent to 1,314.3 at 9:14 a.m. in  New York  after
climbing as much as 0.5 percent earlier. Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures rose 5 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to
12,188. Crude oil for April delivery jumped as much as 1.5
percent to $96.89 a barrel.  Earlier gains in futures came as companies from DirecTV to
Chesapeake Energy Corp. reported higher-than-estimated earnings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
