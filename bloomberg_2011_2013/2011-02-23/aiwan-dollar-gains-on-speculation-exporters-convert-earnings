  Taiwan ’s dollar rebounded from the
biggest loss since November on speculation exporters repatriated
income at a more-favorable  exchange rate .  The currency slumped 0.7 percent yesterday as global funds
sold $616 million more local shares than they bought, exchange
data show. Government bonds rose and the Taiex index of shares
fell for a third successive day as investors sought the safety
of sovereign debt after escalating violence in Libya and a surge
in oil prices fanned concern global growth will slow.  “Exporters could be buying the  Taiwan dollar  after
yesterday’s fall,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at
First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “The gains in bonds are highly
related to the bad performance of stocks.”  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.525 against its
U.S. counterpart as of 9:18 a.m. local time, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.582 yesterday, the weakest
level since Jan. 17.  The yield on the 1 percent bond due January 2016 fell one
basis point to 1.084 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 28,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
