The Australian dollar advanced for a
second day versus the greenback after reports showed business
investment climbed to a record in the final three months of 2010
and an index of leading indicators increased in December.  The currency strengthened versus 12 of its 16 major
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg as the data spurred traders to
add to bets the central bank will boost  interest rates  in the
next 12 months.  New Zealand ’s dollar fell to its lowest level
since October against the yen on speculation its central bank
will cut the benchmark rate next month as earthquake damage
weighs on economic growth.  “The Aussie bounced off the back of the capital
expenditure numbers,” said Anthony Gray, head of currency
dealing in Sydney at Travelex Global Business Payments, a
foreign-exchange network.    Australia ’s currency rose 0.7 percent to $1.0095 at 11:31
a.m. in  New York , from $1.0022 yesterday. It reached $1.02 on
Feb. 4, the highest level since Jan. 3. The Aussie traded at
82.53 yen, compared with 82.70 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar fetched 74.81 U.S. cents, compared
with 74.57 cents. The kiwi fell 0.6 percent to 61.16 yen after
touching 60.85, the lowest level since Oct. 29.    Capital spending  in Australia advanced 1.3 percent in the
fourth quarter to A$29.7 billion ($29.8 billion), the highest on
record, the statistics bureau said today.  Aussie Rate Outlook  Traders are betting Australia’s central bank will increase
its 4.75 percent benchmark rate 32 basis points over the next 12
months, up from 26 basis points yesterday, according to a Credit
Suisse Group AG index based on swaps prices.  The New York-based Conference Board said today its index of
leading economic indicators for Australia climbed 0.7 percent to
121.3 in December.  New Zealand’s currency fell for a third day against the yen
as traders’ bets implied an 88 percent chance the nation’s
central bank will cut the 3 percent target rate, up from a 28
percent probability two days ago, according to a separate Credit
Suisse index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
