(Corrects cost of project in second paragraph.)  Continental Resources Inc. said it
is pursuing a permit to drill for oil and gas on 67,000 acres in
the Paris Basin in  France .  The $13.8 million project would be an 80/20 joint venture
with Jordan Oil & Gas of Healdsburg,  California , which has
experience in France, Continental said in its fourth-quarter
earnings release.  Continental, based in Enid, Oklahoma, said the French
government may issue a permit by the end of 2011. The Paris
Basin is a shale formation similar to the Bakken Shale in  North
Dakota , which accounted for 47 percent of Continental’s fourth-
quarter oil and gas production.  “We believe there is the potential for significant
recoverable oil reserves, using technology we’ve developed in
the Bakken,” Continental Chairman Harold Hamm said about the
Paris Basin project in the statement.  Toreador Resources Corp., based in Paris, and Calgary-based
Vermilion Energy Inc. have announced plans to drill in the Paris
Basin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
