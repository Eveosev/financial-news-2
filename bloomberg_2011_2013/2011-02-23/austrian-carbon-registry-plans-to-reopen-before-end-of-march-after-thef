Austria’s Carbon Registry plans to
reopen before the end of March to allow companies “good time”
to comply with 2010 emission requirements, according to Romana
Kichler, a spokeswoman for the registry.  Austria is still working on a report on its security
measures for the European Commission, Kichler said in a
telephone interview from Vienna today.  Austria said Jan. 21 488,141 European Union carbon
allowances were illegally transferred from a reserve account
after a “massive cyber attack.” The registry has been closed
since the attack.  The permits were found and frozen in Liechtenstein and  Sweden , and Austria has applied for the permits to be returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
