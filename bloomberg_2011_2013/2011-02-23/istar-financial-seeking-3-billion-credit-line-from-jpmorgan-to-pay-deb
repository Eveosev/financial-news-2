  IStar Financial Inc ., the commercial
real-estate finance company that must extend debt maturities to
avoid restructuring, will discuss $3 billion in loans with
potential lenders tomorrow, according to people briefed on the
matter.  Proceeds of the JPMorgan Chase & Co.-led financing will be
used to repay secured loans maturing in June 2011 and 2012 and a
portion of the company’s unsecured debt maturing this year,
IStar said yesterday in a statement. The company said it hasn’t
yet received commitments for the new  credit line . The bank
meeting will be held at 2:30 p.m. in New York, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are private.  Chief Executive Officer Jay Sugarman is trying to take
advantage of loan prices approaching a three-year high as the New
York-based company deals with $2.7 billion of debt scheduled to
mature this year. The lender’s stock and bonds have soared in
the past year as capital markets have opened to the neediest
firms and commercial real estate has stabilized.  “This will refinance 2011 maturities, but 2012 will
probably need to be addressed,” said Timothy Daileader,
director of research at Knight Capital Group Inc. in
Greenwich,  Connecticut . “The old financing that they are
replacing was very inexpensive, so the new financing will likely
come at higher cost and eat into their profitability.”  IStar has $2.67 billion in long-term debt obligations due
in 2011 and $3.42 billion maturing next year, according to a
Nov. 8 regulatory filing. The company has $8.52 billion in long-
term debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, the filing shows. The
company has posted a net loss in eight of the past nine
quarters, according to Bloomberg data.  Share Surge  Shares of IStar, which has funded properties including the
Trump SoHo hotel-condominium building in lower  Manhattan , have
more than doubled to $8.39 since October and are up from 76
cents in February 2009. They rose 64 cents to $9.03 at 10 a.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.  The lender’s $501.7 million of 8.625 percent senior
unsecured bonds due in June 2013 have risen 26 cents to 101.25
cents on the dollar since March as of yesterday, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  The Standard & Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index
has risen 3.51 cents this year to 96.42 cents on the dollar
yesterday. On Feb. 14, the index closed at 96.48 cents on the
dollar, the highest since November 2007. The index tracks the
100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged loans, which
are usually rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
lower than BBB- by S&P.  To contact the reporters on this story:
