  France Telecom SA  Chief Executive
Officer Stephane Richard was named chairman, taking lead of
France’s largest phone company’s board from former CEO Didier Lombard as part of a  succession plan  announced a year ago.  Richard’s added title starts March 1, the Paris-based
company said today in a statement. Lombard, 68, will stay on as
a special adviser to Richard, 49, on “strategic options and
technological outlook,” the company said.  Richard replaced Lombard as CEO a year ago. While he was
hired in 2009 to take charge after Lombard’s retirement, his
takeover was accelerated by dozens of employee suicides that
unions blamed on stress caused by a reorganization aimed at
making the company more competitive.    France  Telecom shares today fell 3 cents to 16.20 euros in
Paris trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
