Fenerbahce Sportif Hizmetler Sanayi
& Ticaret AS slumped in Istanbul after its parent, soccer club
Fenerbahce, was barred from playing in this season’s UEFA
Champions League in an alleged match-fixing scandal.  Fenerbahce Sportif dropped 4.4 liras, or 9.2 percent, to
43.70 liras at 9:45 a.m., the biggest decline since July 18. The
decision, which is being appealed at tribunal, will cost
Fenerbahce about 25 million euros in lost revenues, the club
told the exchange.  The Turkish soccer federation made the ruling after
European soccer body UEFA said it might take disciplinary action
against the entire Turkish league should Fenerbahce, the league
champions, not withdraw from this season’s competition,
according to a statement on its website yesterday.  Trabzonspor Sportif Yatirim & Futbol Isletmeciligi Ticaret
AS, which owns the rights to the team brand of soccer club
Trabzonspor, surged 1.4 liras, or 11 percent, to 14.70 liras.
Trabzonspor will replace Fenerbahce in the competition, UEFA
said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
