The Slovak units of Deutsche Telekom
AG and  France Telecom  SA want the government to lower the fees
for extending their mobile-phone operating licenses in the east
European country,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported.  Slovak Telekom, in which Deutsche Telekom owns 51 percent,
and France Telecomâ€™s Orange Slovakia filed an appeal against the
verdict of the Slovak telecommunication regulator, the newspaper
said citing Roman Vavro, the spokesman for the regulator.  Earlier this month the charge for Orange was set at 41
million euros ($59 million) and at 48 million euros for Slovak
Telekom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
