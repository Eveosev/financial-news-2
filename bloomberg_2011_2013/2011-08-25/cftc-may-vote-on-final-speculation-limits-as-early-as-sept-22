The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  may vote as early as Sept. 22 to complete Dodd-Frank
Act limits on speculative trading in commodities such as oil,
natural gas and wheat, CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said.  The so-called position-limits rule and regulations
governing derivatives clearinghouses may be voted on by
commissioners next month, Gensler told reporters today during a
CFTC economic research conference in Washington. The agency has
a rulemaking meeting scheduled for Sept. 22.  “I don’t know if it will be that meeting or early
October,” Gensler said. “I feel very good about the progress
staff has made.”  The position-limits measure, aimed at restricting the
influence of big traders in commodities markets, spurred more
than 13,000 comments from supporters such as  Delta Air Lines
Inc. (DAL)  and opponents including Barclays Capital after it was
proposed in January.  Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation overhaul enacted last
year, aims to reduce risk and boost transparency in the $601
trillion over-the-counter swaps market after largely unregulated
trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The rules will govern
trades conducted by companies including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Cargill Inc.  The CFTC may vote in October or November on final rules
governing business conduct standards for swap dealers, major
swap participants and other market participants, Gensler said.
The agency also plans to seek public comment in September on a
proposed timeline for implementing the final rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
