China’s stocks rose the most in more
than 10 months after  Bank of China Ltd. (601988)  reported record profit
and investors speculated the Chinese government is increasing
fiscal spending to bolster the world’s second-biggest economy.  Bank of China , the nation’s third-largest bank, led a gauge
of lenders to the second-biggest gain among industry groups
after profit surged 28 percent.  China Railway Group Ltd. (601390)  jumped
2.5 percent and Tianjin Capital Environmental Protection Group
Co. surged 10 percent after Shanghai Securities News reported
China plans to spend over 2.3 trillion yuan for new subway lines
and sewage treatment. PetroChina Co. and Jiangxi Copper Co.
paced an advance for commodity producers on speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will announce a third round of asset purchases.  “First-half earnings growth has been part of the reason
for the market’s gains,” said Zhang Han, a strategist at Guotai
Junan Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “The U.S. is likely to use
QE3 to pour liquidity into global capital markets.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, jumped 74.2 points, or 2.9 percent, to
2,615.26 as of the 3 p.m. close, the most since Oct. 15. The CSI
300 Index gained 3.3 percent to 2,903.84.  The Shanghai gauge is valued at 12 times estimated
earnings, compared with a record low of 11.57 times set on Aug.
22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has lost 6.9
percent this year as the central bank raised  interest rates  five
times and ordered lenders to set aside more cash as deposit
reserves 12 times since the start of 2010 to contain inflation
that quickened to 6.5 percent last month, the fastest pace in
three years.  Inflation Outlook  China’s inflation rate in August may be equal to or even
higher than July levels as pork prices jumped, National Business
Daily reported, citing unidentified people.  August pork prices may climb about 50 percent from a year
earlier, lifting consumer prices, the newspaper said. Pork
prices are unlikely to decline “significantly” in the short
term because tight hog supply hasn’t eased, the newspaper cited
Li Guoxiang, a researcher at the  Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences , as saying. The central bank kept yields on three-month
bills unchanged, while money-market rates rose.  The gauge tracking financial companies in the CSI 300 rose
4.5 percent, the most among 10 industry groups after telecom.
Bank of China advanced 2.4 percent to 3.02 yuan. Bank of Nanjing
Co. added 4.4 percent to 8.58 yuan. Industrial Bank Co. jumped
5.9 percent to 13.77 yuan.  Banks Advance  Bank of China’s first-half profit jumped 28 percent to a
record 66.5 billion yuan as loan and fee income climbed. Profit
was in line with the 65.8 billion yuan median estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Bank of Nanjing, the lender
part-owned by BNP Paribas SA, said first-half net income rose 33
percent from a year earlier to 1.59 billion yuan.  “The banks so far have reported very strong profit
growth,” May Yan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Barclays Plc,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “These stocks are
probably going to trade in a range. But right now we are
probably at the bottom of the range so there should be value.”  UBS AG cut its estimate for  China ’s economic growth this
year to 9 percent from 9.3 percent and its forecast for 2012 to
8.3 percent from 9 percent, citing weaker prospects for
expansion in developed economies. China may boost investment and
ease policy as early as the end of the year if the economy
falters,  Wang Tao , a UBS economist, said in a report.  “Since transport infrastructure investment has already
been pushed up substantially in the previous stimulus, we think
social housing, water systems and irrigation projects, as well
as environmental and other social projects will be more of a
focus next time around,” the report said.  Infrastructure Spending  China may spend 1.06 trillion yuan ($166 billion) on
household and industrial sewage treatment in the five years
through 2015, the Shanghai Securities News reported today,
citing a Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning report.  Two plans for building urban sewage and garbage treatment
facilities will be submitted to the State Council for approval
within the year, according to the newspaper.  Tianjin Capital surged by the 10 percent daily limit to
6.16 yuan. Beijing Originwater Technology Co. added 1.7 percent
to 49.38 yuan.  Chinese cities may spend 1.27 trillion yuan building new
subway lines in the five years through 2015, the Shanghai
Securities News reported, citing information it obtained from a
subway development forum. The investments may increase the total
length of subway systems to 2,600 kilometers, the newspaper
reported. China currently has 50 subway lines with a total
length of 1,568 kilometers, according to the report.  China Railway Group, the biggest construction company by
total assets, rose 2.5 percent to 3.23 yuan. China Railway
Construction Corp., builder of more than half the nation’s rail
links since 1949, climbed 2.6 percent to 4.80 yuan.  Jackson Hole   U.S. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will deliver a speech at
Jackson Hole,  Wyoming , on Aug. 26, fueling speculation whether
he would signal a willingness to consider a third round of bond
purchases, or quantitative easing.  Jiangxi Copper increased 4.3 percent to 32.95 yuan.
Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. added 3.6 percent to 9.44 yuan.
PetroChina advanced 2.6 percent to 10.10 yuan, the biggest rise
since Dec. 13.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange
rose for a third day, adding as much as 0.4 percent to $8,908.50
a metric ton.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years rose
4 percent in July, the most in four months, the U.S. Commerce
Department said. That’s double the median projection of 81
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Home prices  rose 0.9
percent in June from the previous month, another report showed.  China United Network Communications Ltd. (600050)  led gains for
telecom stocks, surging 6.8 percent to 4.87 yuan, the most since
Dec. 13. Its unit China Unicom ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. said net income
rose 50 percent from a year earlier to 2.48 billion yuan in the
three months ended June 30. The profit exceeded the 969 million
yuan average of four analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
