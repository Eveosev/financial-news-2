Copper may rise on speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will act to bolster the economy in the U.S., the
world’s second-biggest consumer of the metal.  Six of 11 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 55 percent, said prices will gain next week. One
predicted a drop and four forecast little change. Copper for
three-month delivery was up 2.2 percent for this week at $9,022
a metric ton by 5 p.m. yesterday on the London Metal Exchange.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to
give a speech today at an annual symposium in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming. A year ago, he hinted at a second round of asset
purchases to stimulate the  U.S. economy . The Fed bought $600
billion in Treasuries from November through June in a second
stage of so-called quantitative easing, known as QE2.  “Everyone is waiting to see how the U.S. Fed will react in
the coming week,” Marc Kaplan, president of Mews Metals Trading
LLC in Verona,  New Jersey , said by e-mail Aug. 24.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of Aug. 19.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
73 of the past 151 weeks, or 48 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 6 Bearish: 1 Hold: 4  To contact the reporter on this story:
