(Corrects currency conversion in third paragraph of story
published yesterday.)  India  clarified that local insurance
companies can sell stakes without having to complete a decade of
operations, clearing the way for  Japan ’s Nippon Life Insurance
Co. to buy part Reliance Life Insurance Co.  “Indian promoters can bring their stake down to 26
percent,” D.K. Mittal, banking secretary in the finance
ministry said today. “We are not changing any rule here. We are
just making a clarification.”  Nippon Life agreed to buy 26 percent stake in billionaire
Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Life in March for 30.6 billion
rupees ($665 million), making the largest foreign direct
investment in the South Asian nation’s insurance industry.  “The clarification made by the finance ministry will help
domestic insurance companies as the capital injections will
become easier,” said Dolly Parmar, an analyst at IFCI Financial
Services Ltd. “This will facilitate companies to access much
needed capital.”  Shares of  Reliance Capital Ltd. (RCAPT) , the parent of Reliance
Life, fell 0.8 percent to 391.25 rupees in Mumbai today. The
announcement was made after market hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
