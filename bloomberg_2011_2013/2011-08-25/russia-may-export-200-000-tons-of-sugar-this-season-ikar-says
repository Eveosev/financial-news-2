Russia  may export at least 200,000
metric tons of sugar made from local beets if prices fall below
20 rubles ($0.69) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) on the domestic market
this season, according to the Institute for Agricultural Market
Studies.  Russian sugar may be the cheapest available from Poland to
China if prices drop below 19 rubles a kilogram, according to an
estimate on the  website  of Ikar, as the Moscow-based institute
is known. Russia’s sugar season runs from Aug. 1 through July
31, Ikar analyst Yevgeny Ivanov said by phone today.  Russia may export to traditional markets in Central Asia
including Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan,
according to Ikar. Some shipments may go to  China  through
Russia’s Altai region and Kazakhstan this season, Ivanov said.  Exports also may go to more unusual destinations in  Europe ,
Africa and the  Middle East  in the current season if Russian
prices fall far enough, according to Ikar.  Russian sugar exports in the 1997-2010 period peaked in
1999 at 700,000 tons, Ikar said. Shipments exceeded 400,000 tons
in 2000 and 300,000 tons in 2007, its research showed.  Ikar estimates domestic sugar output at 4.3 million tons
this year and consumption at 5.5 million tons, Ivanov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
