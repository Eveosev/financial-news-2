Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about
$600 million in Tokyo as chief  fund manager  at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co., comments on the resignation of Steve Jobs as chief executive officer of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
　　“There won’t be much impact on Apple’s management. The
stock might be sold temporarily. Steve Jobs’s health problem was
already talked about.”
　　“Apple’s management was partly dependent on the charismatic
manager, so if he is going to step away, Apple may have come to
a threshold. Apple may already have peaked out in terms of the
market capitalization and stock price, so this resignation may
become the symbol of that.”
