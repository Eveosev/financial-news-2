Claims for U.S. unemployment
benefits unexpectedly rose last week, pushed up for a second
time by a labor dispute at  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)   Jobless claims climbed by 5,000 to 417,000 in the week
ended Aug. 20, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a
drop in claims to 405,000, according to the median forecast. At
least 8,500 applications were filed by workers at Verizon last
week, compared with 12,500 the prior week, the agency said.  The report signals that excluding the communications
dispute, companies are slowing the pace of firings, which may
ease concern that consumers will cut back on spending. At the
same time, an unemployment rate at 9.1 percent is a reminder
that a sustained labor-market rebound has yet to develop two
years into the economic recovery.  “The problem over the last 18 months to two years hasn’t
been  the layoff side,” said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist
at Pierpont Securities LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The real
problem has been we’re not getting the normal pace of hiring”
that comes with a recovery. “For all the talk of impending doom
in the economy, there is still not a lot of evidence of that.”  Stock-index futures held earlier gains after the report.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in
September rose 0.1 percent to 1,173.6 at 8:41 a.m. in  New York .
 Treasury securities  climbed, sending the yield on the benchmark
10-year note down to 2.27 percent from 2.30 percent late
yesterday.  Survey Results  Jobless benefits applications were projected to fall from
the 408,000 initially reported for the prior week, according to
the median forecast of 46 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Estimates ranged from 395,000 to 416,000. The Labor Department
revised the prior week’s figure up to 412,000.  New York-based Verizon said this week that 45,000 striking
workers began returning to work on Aug. 22 while talks continue,
a truce that may help the carrier avoid losses a prolonged
walkout would have caused. Employees are returning while the two
sides keep negotiating what the company called “major issues.”  Benefits, work flexibility and  job security  were among the
matters that still need to be negotiated, Verizon said Aug. 20.
Contracts that expired on Aug. 6 will remain in effect for an
undefined period, Verizon said.  Average Climbs  Today’s data showed the four-week moving average, a less-
volatile measure than the weekly figures, increased to 407,500
last week from 403,500.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
dropped by 80,000 in the week ended Aug. 13 to 3.64 million, the
fewest since September 2008.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
20,400 to 3.64 million in the week ended Aug. 6.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits
fell to 2.9 percent in the week ended Aug. 13 from 3 percent,
today’s report showed.  Nineteen states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while 34 reported a decline. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Payroll Forecast  Payrolls grew by about 95,000 in August, according to the
median forecast of economists surveyed so far by Bloomberg
before the Sept. 2 jobs report. That would compare with 117,000
in July which brought the average gain over the past three
months to 111,000. Employment gains averaged 204,000 in the
first four months of the year.  The weak labor market and concerns over slowing growth and
falling asset prices will be foremost on the minds of central
bankers and policy makers this weekend when they meet at the
 Federal Reserve ’s annual symposium in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke tomorrow is due to give his
keynote speech. Investors and economists will be listening for
clues on whether the head of the central bank hints at
additional measures to boost growth and jobs.  Mass layoff announcements have increased in recent weeks as
companies brace for a possible extended slowdown in economic
growth.  Bank Cutbacks  Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender, will eliminate
about 3,500 jobs this quarter to focus “on what we can
control” amid market turmoil, said Chief Executive Officer
 Brian T. Moynihan . “It is tough to have to manage through
reductions, but we owe it to our customers and our shareholders
to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses
carefully.”  The 50 largest banks around the world announced almost
60,000 job reductions through the first week of August, the
fastest rate since 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Federal, state and local governments continue to seek ways
of cutting staff. The  Postal Service  this month circulated a
proposal to cut 220,000 employees, 39 percent of full-time
staff, by 2015.  Still, the process would need congressional permission and
President Barack Obama’s signature on a law to break a labor
contract with its largest union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
