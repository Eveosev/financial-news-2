AOL Inc. (AOL) , the  Internet company 
that’s struggling to halt a sales slide, said it retained
investment bank Allen & Co. and law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen
& Katz as advisers. The stock jumped.  Graham James, a spokesman for New York-based AOL, confirmed
the hiring of the firms in an interview. He declined to comment
further.  AOL has posted net losses of almost $800 million in less
than two years as a standalone company as it has struggled to
make money from online advertising and its profitable dial-up
Internet business has become increasingly obsolete. The Internet
pioneer spun off from  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  in 2009 plunged to a
record low this month after cutting its profit forecast because
of slowing growth in display-advertising sales.  The company, valued at $1.49 billion at today’s closing
price, could attract private-equity bidders, companies such as
Evercore Partners Inc. have said.  AOL rose $1.13, or 8.8 percent, to $13.94 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has fallen 52 percent
from its peak in April 2010.  Adweek reported AOL had retained the advisers earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
