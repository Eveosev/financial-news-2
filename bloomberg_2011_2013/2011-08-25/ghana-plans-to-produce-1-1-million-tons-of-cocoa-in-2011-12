Ghana , the second-biggest cocoa
producer, aims to produce 1.1 million metric tons of the beans
in 2011-12 through increased yields, said Kwabena Asante-Poku,
deputy chief executive officer of the  Ghana  Cocoa Board.  Output will exceed 1 million tons by the close of the 2010-
11 season, earlier than the target by 2012-13, Asante-Poku said
in an interview at his office yesterday.  “Next year we aim for 1.1 million tons, but if the weather
is on our side, it can be more at 1.2 million tons,” he said.
“The cocoa farms currently yield about 400 kilograms (2,204
pounds) per hectare (2.47 acres), but Cocoa Board’s target is to
increase it to 1,000 kilograms by 2015.”  Fertilizers are applied to about 30 percent of cocoa farms,
he said. Programs to control disease and pests will also be a
focus, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
