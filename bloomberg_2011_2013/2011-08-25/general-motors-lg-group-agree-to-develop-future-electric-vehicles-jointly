General Motors Co. (GM) , the maker of the
plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt, and LG Group have agreed to form
a partnership to design and engineer future electric cars, a
high priority of Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson.  GM, 32 percent owned by the U.S., brings expertise in
vehicles and Seoul-based LG knows how to develop and build
lithium-ion batteries. Closely held LG supplies batteries for
the Volt and the mechanically identical Opel Ampera sold in
 Europe . The deal does not involve an exchange of equity, the
companies said today in a statement.  The agreement should help Detroit-based GM stay current on
battery technology and ensure that the company has close
relations with a supplier that can help engineer electric-power
systems, said  Michael Robinet , a Northville, Michigan-based vice
president of research firm IHS Automotive.  “In tomorrow’s vehicles, customers will look at technology
as a differentiator,” Robinet said. “Vehicle manufacturers
will be looking to link up with major battery players to ensure
that they have new technology. There will be an interesting
round of musical chairs.”  Akerson boosted Volt production plans for next year to
60,000 from 45,000 after exploring an increase to 120,000 of the
plug-in hybrids. This partnership will not make batteries for
the next-generation Volt, Kevin Kelly, a GM spokesman, said in a
telephone interview.  GM slipped 11 cents to $22.26 at 12:02 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 33
percent since a $33 initial public offering in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
