Soccer matches in  Spain ’s top two
divisions will go ahead this weekend after players called off a
strike that wiped out the opening round of games.  The players’ union, AFE, ended the dispute after reaching
an agreement with the professional league that guarantees the
amount of money more than 200 players are owed by clubs, the
union said on its  website  today.  Another accord will allow players who are owed three months
of their salaries, or the equivalent amount, to leave their club
and sign with another, AFE said.  The second round of games is scheduled for this weekend and
Aug. 29. The opening games for the top division, which should
have been played last weekend, will be rescheduled for Jan. 22,
with the games from that weekend moving to May 2, the league
said. In the second division, the games due to have been played
last weekend will move to Oct. 26.  Players said Aug. 11 they’d strike the first two weeks of
the season. The stoppage was “absolutely unjustified” and
“sterile,” the league said at the time.  The players’ union today expressed its thanks for “the
patience and understanding of all those who might have been
affected by a measure that we see as fair and legitimate.”  Juanjo Montaner, a spokesman for AFE, didn’t respond to
telephone calls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
