Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd., the
fuel processor owned by  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  and the government,
will be allowed to import, refine and sell oil from January to
boost supplies, the  Daily Nation  reported, citing Energy
Ministry permanent secretary,  Patrick Nyoike .  The plan to enable the country’s sole refinery to start
marketing oil follows concerns from local companies that the
plant’s output often falls short of expectations, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
