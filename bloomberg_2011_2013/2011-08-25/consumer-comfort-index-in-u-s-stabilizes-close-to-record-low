Consumer confidence  stabilized last
week at a level that’s within striking distance of an all-time
low as Americans remained pessimistic about the economy.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index was minus 47 in the
week to Aug. 21 compared with minus 48.3 reading the previous
period that halted a three-week slide. The gain was within the
survey’s 3-point margin of error. The figure is close to minus
54 in January 2009, which matched the worst reading in the
history of the series dating back to 1985.  Confidence among those earning more than $100,000 a year
fell in the past month to the lowest level since 2009, possibly
due to stock market weakness and mounting concern the recovery
may falter. Unemployment above 9 percent has also soured
consumers’ moods, posing a risk of further erosion of household
spending that accounts for 70 percent of the economy.  “The consumer sector remains historically weak, which is
one reason why investors are likely to not find much comfort in
the modest improvement in sentiment,” said  Joseph Brusuelas , a
senior economist at Bloomberg LP in  New York .  Another report today showed first-time applications for
jobless benefits increased by 5,000 to 417,000 in the week ended
Aug. 20, according to the Labor Department. Claims were pushed
up by a labor dispute at Verizon Communications Inc.  Stocks dropped worldwide, snapping a three-day rally for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The  S&P 500  fell 1.6 percent to
1,159.27 at the 4 p.m. close in New York.  Recession Levels  Even after last week’s gain in confidence, the Bloomberg
comfort index has been stuck below minus 40, the level
associated with recessions or their aftermath, since the end of
February.  “The slim good news is that the slide has halted,”  Gary
Langer , president of Langer Research Associates LLC in New York,
which compiles the index for Bloomberg, said in a statement.
“The bad is that the index nonetheless remains in a dreadful
state.”  The gauge, which began December 1985, has averaged minus
45.1 this year, compared with minus 45.7 for all of 2010 and
minus 47.9 in 2009, the year the last recession ended, the
report showed.  The comfort survey showed improvement in two of the three
subcomponents. The index of Americans’ views of the economy rose
to minus 84.3 last week from minus 85.4. The gauge of personal
finances climbed to minus 4.5 after a minus 8.4 reading in the
prior period. A measure of the buying climate dropped to minus
52.4 from minus 51.2.  By Income  Confidence among households with annual income exceeding
$100,000 fell last week to minus 19, and the average over the
past month was the lowest since 2009. For those making less than
$15,000 a year, the comfort index dropped to minus 80.9, the
worst reading in a year.  Sentiment among Americans with college educations dropped
to minus 40.6, the weakest level since April 2010.  Democrats are also feeling more downbeat as their
confidence gauge fell to minus 55, the lowest reading since
March 2010. Sentiment among Republicans improved to minus 44.4,
widening the gap between the two parties to 10.6 points, the
most since March. Political independents’ confidence rose to
minus 42.8, the best reading since April.  In the past month, confidence “has slid by 15 points among
Democrats but held essentially steady among Republicans, perhaps
signaling a shift in trajectories -- one worth watching in the
2012 election season,” Langer said in the statement.  Other measures of sentiment are equally gloomy. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer
sentiment plunged in August to a three-decade low.  Retailer Results  Consumers’ reluctance to spend is hurting results at
retailers.  American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO) , a Pittsburgh-based
teen apparel chain, yesterday reduced its full-year profit
forecast, citing higher costs for cotton and “tempered” sales
expectations for the second half of the year.  “The lack of an economic recovery has created a
persistently challenging retail environment,” James O’Donnell,
chief executive officer, said on a conference call.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index is based on responses
to telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,000 consumers
aged 18 and over. Each week, 250 respondents are asked for their
views on the economy, personal finances and buying climate; the
percentage of negative responses is subtracted from the share of
positive views and divided by three. The most recent reading is
based on the average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The
margin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.  Field work for the index is done by SSRS/Social Science
Research Solutions in Media,  Pennsylvania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
