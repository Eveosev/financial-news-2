South Africa equities erased an
earlier increase as speculation  Germany ’s public finances are
deteriorating and an unexpected advance in U.S. unemployment
benefit claims reduced demand for riskier assets.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index declined 255.14, or 0.9
percent, to 29,349.45 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , closed at its
highest in a week, adding 1.27 rand, or 0.5 percent, to 272.06
rand. Copper rose, heading for the biggest gain in two weeks,
after Glencore International Plc said demand growth for the
metal is set to maintain its pace.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, gained for a second day, advancing 1.11 rand, or 0.5
percent, to 229.45 rand. Separately, the miner was raised to
“buy” from “hold” at Societe Generale SA by equity analyst
Abhishek Shukla, with a 12-month target price 23.20 pounds.  Basil Read Holdings Ltd. (BSR)  , a construction company,
fell for a second day, dropping 8 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
11.52 rand. The group reported a 24 percent decline in earnings
per share to 79.37 cents for the six months to June 30.  Cipla Medpro South Africa Ltd. (CMP)  , a generic-drug
manufacturer, climbed the most since Aug. 16, adding 6 cents, or
1 percent, to 6.33 rand. The drugmaker said first-half net
income increased to 190.1 million rand ($26 million) from 108.7
million rand a year earlier.  Woolworths Holdings Ltd. (WHL SJ), a clothing and food
retailer, closed at the highest level since it started trading
in 1997, advancing 50 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 32.60 rand. The
retailer said full-year earnings excluding extraordinary items
climbed 31 percent.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest maker of motor
fuel from coal, declined 3.41 rand, or 1.1 percent, to 306.60
rand, paring yesterday’s 1.2 percent gain. Crude oil retreated
in  New York  after an unexpected increase in U.S. unemployment
benefit claims sent equities lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
