Royal Ahold NV, the Dutch owner Stop
& Shop supermarkets in the U.S., had second-quarter net income
of 199 million euros. The average estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for profit of 217 million euros.  “In view of capital market conditions, we have decided to
accelerate the 1 billion-euro share buyback program that we
started on March 7,’’ Amsterdam-based Ahold said in an e-mailed
statement. “The acceleration will have immediate effect and we
expect the program to be completed by March 2012,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
