Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) ,
 Baloise Holding AG (BALN)  and other Swiss insurers will compensate for
slowing growth in their home market by making acquisitions,
according to  Fitch Ratings .  Low  interest rates  and slowing economic growth are
depressing earnings in a Swiss insurance market that is already
“highly saturated,” Fitch said in a study published today. The
Swiss insurance industry’s total profit was 8.5 billion Swiss
francs ($10.7 billion) in 2010, the ratings company said.  We expect “strongly capitalized insurance companies to
continue to take advantage of the current challenging market
conditions and make acquisitions if attractive opportunities
arise,” Fitch said.  Zurich Financial,  Switzerland ’s biggest insurer, bought 51
percent of Banco Santander SA’s Latin America insurance business
for $2.1 billion in February. Third-ranked Baloise completed its
75 million-euro ($109 million) acquisition of Avero
Schadeverzekering Benelux NV from Eureko Group in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
