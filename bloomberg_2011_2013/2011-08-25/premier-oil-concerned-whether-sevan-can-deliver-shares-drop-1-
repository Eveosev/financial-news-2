Premier Oil Plc (PMO) , a London-based oil
explorer, said it’s concerned whether  Sevan Marine ASA (SEVAN)  is able
to deliver a unit to start pumping oil at the U.K. Huntington
field in 2012. The shares fell the most in 2 1/2 years.  Huntington’s partners have already begun drilling offshore
producing wells, said Chief Executive Officer Simon Lockett.
Sevan, which last month received $36.1 million from creditors to
stave off bankruptcy, is scheduled to deliver a floating oil-
production and storage vessel in the second quarter.  “Frankly, we are still concerned about Sevan’s financial
position,” Lockett said in a phone interview. “We are still
reliant on Sevan completing pre-financing. But they need more to
complete the project. We are anxious to see that they get the
project done.”  Premier shares fell 9.7 percent to 316 pence by the 4:30
p.m. close in  London , the biggest drop since Jan. 7, 2009.  Premier is relying on Huntington to reach output of 75,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day next year. Its projects in
Vietnam and  Indonesia , due to start within weeks, will help to
raise production to about 60,000 barrels a day by the end of the
year, the London-based company said today in a statement.  Gerry Hennigan, an analyst with  Goodbody Stockbrokers  in
Dublin, revised estimates for 2012 production to 67,500 barrels
a day. “The uncertainty over Huntington has already led us to
pull back our expectations,” he said in an e-mailed report.  First Output  Premier plans to pump first oil at the  Chim Sao  field in
 Vietnam  next month, Lockett said. Its Indonesian  Gajah Baru 
project is also ready to begin output. Premier extracted 36,900
barrels of oil equivalent a day on average in the first half.  “We are a couple of weeks away for them coming on, which
is fantastic,” Lockett said.  The company plans to drill as many as 25 exploration and
appraisal wells in Indonesia,  Norway , Vietnam and the U.K
through 2012. It’s working with partners to pump first oil at
the North Sea  Catcher  development in 2015 and at the Pelican and
Naga fields in Indonesia in 2013 or 2014, Lockett said. The
company plans to bid for fields in Iraq next year, he said.  Premier’s first-half profit after tax rose 43 percent to a
record $88.5 million, the company said in the statement. Revenue
fell 6.7 percent to $342.2 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
