The world’s major central banks are
unlikely to raise  interest rates  until 2013 as sluggish global
growth keeps a lid on inflation, Citigroup Inc. said.  “Global economic prospects continue to worsen markedly,
especially for many advanced economies,” Citigroup economists
led by Willem Buiter wrote in a note to investors. “At this
stage our base case is for a long period of low policy rates and
we do not expect” the U.S. Federal Reserve, the  European
Central Bank  or Bank of England “to hike rates before 2013,”
the economists wrote. The Bank of  Japan  may not raise rates
until 2014, they said.  Citigroup cut its estimate for global economic expansion
this year to 3.1 percent from 3.4 percent and lowered its 2012
forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.7 percent. “This is the seventh-
biggest monthly cut in Citi’s global growth forecasts over the
last 10 years,” the economists said.  The Fed has already pledged to keep its benchmark rate near
zero for another two years to help stimulate growth in the
world’s largest economy. The ECB has lifted its benchmark twice
this year to 1.5 percent to fight inflation, even as the
region’s debt crisis worsens. The  Bank of England ’s key rate is
at 0.5 percent and Japan’s is between zero and 0.1 percent.  Citigroup said further monetary tightening is unlikely in
 China , where the central bank has raised its key rate five times
since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
