(Corrects headline to remove rate cut.)  Israel ’s shekel is set for its fifth
weekly decline against the dollar on speculation the  Bank of
Israel  will hold borrowing costs for a third month at its
meeting next week.  The currency was little changed at 3.6059 at 3:42 p.m. in
Tel Aviv, poised for a weekly decrease of 0.8 percent. The
shekel has weakened 5.1 percent this month, the second-worst
performer among the 10 most-active  Europe ,  Middle East  and
Africa currencies, according to Bloomberg data. The central bank
will keep its main rate at 3.25 percent on Aug. 29, according to
19 of 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey. One predicts Governor
Stanley Fischer will cut the rate to 3 percent.  “The shekel is losing its attractiveness as the rate
differential with the U.S. may not widen and may even narrow in
the coming months as inflation expectations drop and growth
slows,” Eytan Admoni, head of the international department at
Bank of Jerusalem Ltd., said by telephone. “Ongoing consumer
protests against rising prices and recent attacks are keeping
some foreign investors away from the risk associated with the
shekel.”  Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, were at 3.11 percent,
down from 3.23 percent on Aug. 15, before the  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said consumer prices in July fell for the first time
in more than a year. The  Federal Reserve  pledged on Aug. 9 to
keep its key interest rate near zero until at least mid-2013 to
revive the faltering economy.  Israel became the first country to raise  interest rates ,
from a record low of 0.5 percent in August 2009, spurring
inflows into the country, and driving gains in the currency.
Since the central bank first held the rate June 27, the shekel
has lost 4.5 percent trimming the 12-month gain to 5.8 percent.  Declining Sales  Food sales at chain stores dropped a seasonally adjusted
6.6 percent in July from June, the statistics bureau said Aug.
22, as Israelis reduced purchases amid protests against the high
cost of living. Citizens across the country are demonstrating
against the high prices of items ranging from cottage cheese, a
local staple, to housing, prompting the government to set up a
committee to address economic and social welfare issues.
Economic growth retreated to an annualized 3.3 percent in the
second quarter from a revised 4.7 percent in the first quarter.  Escalating Violence  Three Palestinians were killed and at least 25 injured in
Israeli airstrikes on the  Gaza Strip  overnight and one Israeli
was wounded after more than dozen rockets and mortar shells hit
the south of the country. Violence has escalated after Aug. 18
attacks near the Red Sea resort of Eilat left eight Israelis
dead. At least 14 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes
following that attack.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.68
percent. The rate on the 5.5 percent notes maturing in January
2022 increased one basis point to 4.84 percent, the highest
since Aug. 15.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the time period, rose to 213,
implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.13 percent. The
yield on the CPI-linked bond due in June 2013 was little changed
at 0.96 percent.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, fell for a third day, declining
0.8 percent to 255.36.  To contact the reporter on this story:
