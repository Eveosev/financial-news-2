Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for the
first day in five against the dollar as companies bought the
greenback to pay for imported goods.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
weakened as much as 0.3 percent to 1.5300 per dollar, before
trading at 1.5258 per dollar as of 2:36 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Traders were on the market to buy the dollars for
imports,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader at the local unit
of Access Bank Plc said in a telephone interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
