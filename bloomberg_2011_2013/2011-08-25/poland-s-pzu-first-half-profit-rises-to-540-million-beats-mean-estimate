PZU SA, Poland’s largest insurer,
said first-half profit climbed by a third after boosting
premiums and cutting costs.  Net income rose to 1.55 billion zloty ($536 million) from
1.17 billion zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based firm said in
a regulatory statement today. That matched the 1.5 billion-zloty
average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Premiums rose 5.2 percent to 7.67 billion zloty at the firm
that became central  Europe ’s largest publicly traded insurer by
market value following an initial share sale in May last year.
PZU cut costs related to computer systems and administration.  Increased premiums helped PZU counter a 14 percent drop in
investment income to 1.08 billion zloty after capital was cut by
last year’s record dividend payout.  PZU’s largest rival in central Europe, Vienna Insurance
Group AG, is considering whether to bid for the Polish insurer
that KBC Groep NV has put up for sale, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Peter Hagen said on Aug. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
