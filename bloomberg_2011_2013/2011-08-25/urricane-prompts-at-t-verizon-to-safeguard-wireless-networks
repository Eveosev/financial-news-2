U.S. wireless telephone companies
said they are preparing for Hurricane Irene a day after
regulators expressed concern that clogged mobile-phone networks
slowed emergency calls after this week’s earthquake in Virginia.  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Verizon Wireless  and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  are
taking steps including assembling disaster recovery teams,
generators and supplies to cope with possible flooding and power
outages, the companies said today in separate statements.  Hurricane Irene, the strongest Atlantic storm to threaten
the U.S. since 2005, is forecast to pass near  North Carolina 
this weekend and slam into  New England  next week. More than 65
million people, or one in five Americans, may be affected by the
storm, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Federal Communications Commission is monitoring the
path of the storm and coordinating with the  Federal Emergency
Management Agency  and Homeland Security Department, FCC
spokesman Neil Grace said in an e-mail today.  The FCC said yesterday it’s concerned about incidents in
which wireless calls to 911 were hindered by overwhelmed mobile-
phone networks after the Aug. 23 temblor in  Virginia  that
rattled the U.S. East Coast.  “These are the moments when mobile phone service is needed
most -- and disruptions put lives at risk,” Jamie Barnett,
chief of the agency’s public safety and homeland bureau, said in
an e-mail yesterday on quake-related network congestion. He said
the FCC is contacting wireless carriers to “determine the cause
of reported outages in an immediate effort to identify and
address the problems.”  Spikes in Volume  Congestion reported after the earthquake “was caused by
the wireless networks processing substantial spikes in volume,”
Amy Storey, a spokeswoman for the CTIA wireless industry trade
group, said in an e-mail yesterday. “While some people may have
experienced delayed text or e-mail messages, most went through
in a timely fashion,” she said.  The wireless companies today urged customers to use text-
messaging, rather than voice calls, during an emergency to
minimize network congestion. They also recommended that
customers keep their mobile-phone batteries charged.  Barnett said that the 5.8-magnitude quake near Mineral,
Virginia, illustrated the need for updated 911 services that
allow for text, photo and video messaging. He said the FCC will
continue working with wireless carriers on an emergency-alert
system that would steer government messages around network
congestion to mobile-phone users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
