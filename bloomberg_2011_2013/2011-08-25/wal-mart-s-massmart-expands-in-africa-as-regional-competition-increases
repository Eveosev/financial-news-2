Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , the South
African retailer controlled by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , plans to
accelerate expansion across  Africa  to keep ahead of competitors,
Chief Executive Officer Grant Pattison said.  Store numbers will increase by 8.6 percent to 340 outlets
in fiscal 2012, including two Game stores in  Nigeria , Pattison
said in an interview today. Johannesburg-based Massmart expanded
trading space by 6 percent in the year-earlier period.  “It looks like sub-Saharan Africa will be a better
contributor this year,” Pattison said. Massmart, South Africa’s
biggest food and general goods wholesaler, operates in 13
countries, including Botswana, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia.  South African retailers including Shoprite Holdings Ltd.
and Woolworths Holdings Ltd. this week unveiled plans to ramp up
expansion in Africa to tap rising consumer spending.  In  South Africa , Massmart holds about 10 percent of the
retail food market and Pattison said he expects that to rise to
15 percent to 20 percent in the next five years.  Capital expenditure at Massmart is expected to rise to 1.6
billion rand ($221 million) in fiscal 2012, from 1.1 billion a
year earlier. The company is “comfortable” with higher debt
levels, Pattison said in a presentation today.  Massmart fell 0.3 percent to 150.56 rand as of 12:39 p.m.
in Johannesburg trading. The stock has risen 2.6 percent this
year, compared with a 3 percent gain for the FTSE/JSE Africa
General Retailers Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
