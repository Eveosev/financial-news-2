SIG Plc (SHI) , Europe’s biggest supplier
of insulation, said it made a first-half profit for the first
time since 2008 as sales gained in mainland Europe.  Net income for the six months to June 30 was 1.5 million
pounds ($2.5 million) compared with a loss of 2.4 million pounds
a year earlier, the Sheffield, England-based company said today
in a statement distributed by the Regulatory News Service.
Revenue climbed 10 percent to 1.34 billion pounds.  “These results have benefited from management’s focus on
three key strategic initiatives to improve performance: greater
operational efficiency, upgrading the portfolio and growing the
business,” Chief Executive Officer Chris Davies said in the
statement. SIG will resume dividend payments, he added.  The effect of public spending cuts in the U.K. and a weaker
economic background means the board expects growth to
“moderate” in the second half, Davies said.  Sales in mainland  Europe  rose 16 percent to 752.2 million
pounds, accounting for 56 percent of revenue, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
