Gold fell after rebounding in  New
York  from its worst two-day drop since 2008. Global equities
tumbled in Europe and the U.S., prompting demand for a haven.  Bullion for immediate delivery declined 0.6 percent to
$1,763.28 an ounce after gaining 0.8 percent yesterday. The
metal dropped 7.3 percent in the two days through Aug. 24, the
most since October 2008.  “The market will probably be in hold mode until we have a
listen to what Bernanke says this evening at Jackson Hole,”
said  David Lennox , a resource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney.
“I wouldn’t think traders would be too anxious to bet one way
or the other at this point because I don’t think anyone really
knows what he might say.”  Investors are awaiting a speech by  Federal Reserve  Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, at 10 a.m. New York
time today and are looking for indications of whether the
central bank will embark on further stimulus.  Cash gold has climbed 24 percent this year and reached a
record $1,913.50 an ounce on Aug. 23. Metal for December
delivery was little changed at $1,765.90 in New York.  “We think the price of gold today, unless something
extraordinary happens, will probably remain pretty flat,”
Lennox said in a phone interview.  Stocks dropped worldwide yesterday, snapping a three-day
rally for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after the U.S. said
jobless claims increased and traders sold German equity futures
before France, Italy and Spain extended curbs on short selling.  Stocks Decline  The  S&P 500  fell 1.6 percent to 1,159.27 at 4 p.m. in New
York, after climbing 4.8 percent over the past three days.  “Sellers tried to force gold under $1,700 and couldn’t, so
the funds came back,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago. “This is long-term
buying against the equities.”  Central banks are adding to reserves for the first time in
a generation, joining billionaire investors including  John Paulson  in hoarding bullion. The Federal Reserve has taken the
unprecedented step of saying it will keep borrowing costs at
almost zero percent at least through mid-2013.  CME Group Inc. raised the margin requirements on gold
futures trading at its Comex unit by 27 percent from the close
of trading yesterday.  “Despite this week’s sell‑off, we expect the gold price to
remain supported by a weaker outlook for the dollar and the
economic and financial uncertainty” from the sovereign-debt
turmoil in  Europe , said Lachlan Shaw, analyst at Commonwealth
Bank of Australia in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
