Salamander Energy Plc (SMDR) , a U.K. oil
and gas exploration company, returned to profit, boosted by a 23
percent increase in average daily production.  Net income for the six-month period ended June 30 was $2.48
million, compared with a loss of about $80 million, a year
earlier, the London-based company said in a statement today.
Sales climbed 41 percent to $187.7 million.  Average production climbed to 19,600 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, up from 16,000 barrels in 2010. Full-year
average daily production will be in a range from 21,000 barrels
to 22,000 barrels, Chief Executive Officer James Menzies said in
a telephone interview. The company will spend about $100 million
in the second half on exploration and ramping up production, he
added.  “It’s been a strong operational performance in terms of
adding reserves,” the executive said, adding that the company
now has refinanced its borrowing base with a seven-year $325
million lending facility.  Salamander upgraded proven and probable reserves in the
Bualuang field in the Gulf of  Thailand  and at its Kerendan field
in  Indonesia . The explorer will be looking at “rationalizing”
fields that are not part of its core areas, which include
Thailand and east and central Kalimantan, the executive said.  “We’re looking for opportunities,” Menzies said. “There
are some points of the portfolio that are immaterial so we’ll be
looking at rationalizing that.”  There are about 38 million barrels of oil equivalent in
reserves and resources to be brought into production over the
coming years, according to Salamander.  To contact the reporter on this story:
