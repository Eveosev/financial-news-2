Freddie Liu, chief financial officer
of TPK Holding Co. comments on the resignation of  Steve Jobs  as
Apple Inc. chief executive officer.  TPK, based in Taipei, supplies touch-panels for Apple’s
iPad and iPhone and counts the company as its largest customer.  On changes in Apple’s management:  “The company itself is a very competitive company, so I
don’t think any changes in the management will significantly
damage or change the direction of that company.”  On product strategy:  “Given the way they have come up with new products,
usually products two or three generations down the road are
already in the road map, so I don’t think it’s going to change
that much.”  “Plus, he’ll still act as chairman of the company, so I
really don’t think there’ll be any major changes in terms of the
company’s road map, strategy and products.”  On Steve Jobs and Apple’s role in the electronics industry:  “Apple has totally changed the landscape of the consumer
electronics industry and what exactly we need in a device. They
changed the way all this mobile connectivity worked in people’s
lives.”  On the likelihood of a change in TPK-Apple relationship:  “Not likely. I don’t think so. Most of the products are
already in the road map.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
