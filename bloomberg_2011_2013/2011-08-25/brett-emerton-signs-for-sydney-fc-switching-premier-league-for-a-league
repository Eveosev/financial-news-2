Brett Emerton signed a three-year
contract with Sydney FC that makes the Blackburn Rovers
midfielder the first player to exchange the English Premier
League for  Australia ’s A-League.  Emerton, the Socceroos’ second-most capped player with 87
appearances, will return to Australia after an 11-year career in
 Europe . He’ll play his final match for Blackburn against Everton
in two days, Sydney FC said in an e-mailed statement.  “The board has for some time viewed the signing of Brett
Emerton as a major priority,” Sydney FC Vice Chairman Scott
Barlow said in the statement. “We have been fortunate that this
has come to fruition a year earlier than we had anticipated
after Brett requested, and was granted, a release from the last
year of his contract.”  Sydney’s acquisition of Emerton, 32, comes five days after
Socceroos forwardHarry Kewell signed for fellow A-League club
Melbourne Victory.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
