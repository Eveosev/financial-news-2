Sugar fell the most in three weeks
on signs that rising production in  Asia  and  Europe  will mean
supplies will be ample even as output drops in Brazil, the
world’s biggest grower. Cocoa dropped, and coffee rose.  The European Union, the top producer of beet sugar, may
harvest 17.26 million metric tons next season, the most in six
years, according to Rabobank International. Sugar output in
 India , the second-largest grower, may climb 6.6 percent to 26
million tons next year, the bank estimates. Before today, prices
surged 50 percent in the past year as adverse weather threatened
Brazil’s crops.  “People have been talking about a smaller crop in Brazil,
but at these high prices, everybody else is going to produce
more sugar next year,” Alex Oliveira, a trader with Newedge
Group in  New York , said in a telephone interview.  Raw sugar for October delivery dropped 0.78 cent, or 2.6
percent, to 29.4 cents a pound by 10:56 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. A close at that level would be the biggest loss
since Aug. 2.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell $59, or 1.9
percent, to $3,029 a ton on ICE. Coffee futures gained 0.85
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.746 a pound in New York.  Refined sugar, cocoa and coffee declined on NYSE Liffe in
 London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
