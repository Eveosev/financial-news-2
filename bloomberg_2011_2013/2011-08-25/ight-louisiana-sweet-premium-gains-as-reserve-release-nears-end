Light Louisiana Sweet oil’s premium
to West Texas Intermediate strengthened the most in seven weeks
as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve neared completion of its
release of 30.64 million barrels of crude.  More than 25 million barrels of mostly light, sweet, crude
have been released, according to the most recent  figures  from
the Energy Department, as of Aug. 23.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained $2.50 to $23 a
barrel at 2:11 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the largest jump since July 7. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet added $1 to $26 a barrel over WTI.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  plans to begin receiving nominations for
a segment of its Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude pipeline system
starting Sept. 12, according to a shipper bulletin obtained by
Bloomberg News yesterday.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added $1.25 to $22.50 while Poseidon strengthened $1.50 to
$22.25 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $19.50 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 70 cents.
Thunder Horse’s premium added 50 cents to $25.50 above the
benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was narrowed $1.25 to $12.75 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the tar sands in  Alberta .  The spread for Western Canada Select strengthened 80 cents
to a discount of $12.20 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
