French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said he discussed how the  International Monetary Fund  can
provide more liquidity to countries in need when meeting his
Chinese counterpart President Hu Jintao today.  The two leaders “discussed means of expanding the capacity
of the IMF to support countries that have need of capital,”
Sarkozy told reporters in Beijing today, where he met and dined
with Hu.  The suggestion revisits an idea being explored at the IMF
of using a  credit line  for short-term liquidity needs, said a
French government official who asked not to be identified
because the talks are private. Resources for such a line could
come in part from countries with large currency reserves, the
French official said.  The Washington-based IMF has been assisting the Group of 20
nations in trying to build a safety net to help contain economic
turmoil and avoid contagion. The fund now has two types of
precautionary credit lines for countries with strong economies
facing external risks.  IMF First Deputy Managing Director  John Lipsky  earlier this
year said a short-term liquidity facility could be “created on
a standing basis or embedded in a possible global stability
mechanism that would be activated at times of systemic stress.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
