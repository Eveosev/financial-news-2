India ’s 10-year bonds dropped the
most in a week on speculation demand for the notes will weaken
before a government debt auction scheduled for tomorrow.  Most-traded notes due 2021 snapped a two-day gain as the
finance ministry prepares to raise 110 billion rupees ($2.4
billion) selling notes due in 2018, 2021 and 2027. The offer is
part of the government’s 4.17 trillion rupees borrowing program
for the fiscal year ending March 2012. Bonds also retreated on
speculation the lowest yields in two weeks will deter investors.  “The continuation of debt supplies is a negative,” said
 Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader in Mumbai at Development
Credit Bank. “There was some selling probably because prices
have risen quite a bit.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 rose
three basis points to 8.25 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. It
touched 8.22 percent yesterday, the lowest level since Aug. 11.  The benchmark 10-year bond yield has increased 33 basis
points this year as the central bank boosted borrowing costs
five times to damp inflation that has held above 9 percent for
eight months. The repurchase rate is currently at 8 percent.  The  Federal Reserve ’s decision to keep record-low  interest
rates  and the possibility of more steps to stimulate the  U.S.
economy  may boost commodity prices and fan inflation in India,
the Asian nation’s central bank said.  Commodity Prices  “Given the fiscal limitations and growing signs of
weakness in the U.S., the Fed has already indicated that it will
pursue its near-zero rate policy at least till mid-2013,” the
 Reserve Bank  of India said in its annual report in Mumbai today.
“It has also hinted at another dose of quantitative easing.
This policy stance may keep the commodity prices elevated.”  Crude prices in  New York  have gained 18 percent in the past
12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India
imports about 80 percent of the it oil uses.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased two basis points to 7.65 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
