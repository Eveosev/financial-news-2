Asian stocks rose for a second day
this week after U.S. reports on durable-goods orders and home
prices beat economists’ estimates, easing concern that the
world’s biggest economy is slowing and boosting the earnings
outlook for exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, gained
1.7 percent in  Tokyo .  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , the building
materials supplier that gets 68 percent of sales from the U.S.,
climbed 3.2 percent in Sydney. Samsung Electronics Co., the
world’s second-biggest maker of mobile phones by sales, rose 2.4
percent in Seoul after Steve Jobs resigned as chief executive
officer of rival  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.7 percent to 120.06 as
of 5:55 p.m. in Tokyo, with almost two stocks rising for each
that fell. Global equities erased about $8 trillion in market
value in the past four weeks amid worsening economic data in the
U.S. and Europe’s smoldering sovereign-debt crisis.  “The latest U.S. data shows it’s not all doom and gloom,”
said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “Investors continue to
wrestle with the prospect of lower growth versus a double-dip
recession, and that’s manifesting in volatile financial markets.
There needs to be more evidence of sustainable growth before
you’ll get any sustained move in markets to the upside.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 1.5 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index increased 1.1 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.6 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index advanced 1.5 percent, while  China ’s Shanghai Composite
Index jumped 2.9 percent.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today, erasing losses of as much as 0.6 percent earlier.
The gauge rose 1.3 percent to 1,177.60 in  New York  yesterday,
extending its advance this week to 4.8 percent. Stocks advanced
earlier this week amid speculation Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke will announce measures to revive the slowing U.S.
economy at a meeting of central bankers that begins in  Jackson
Hole , Wyoming, tomorrow.  “What we’re seeing is markets resetting to more realistic
global-growth expectations,” said Belinda Allen, senior analyst
of investment markets research at Colonial First State Global
Asset Management, which oversees about $150 billion. “The
volatility will continue, and I can’t say that shares have
finished falling. Most investors now believe Jackson Hole will
be a non-event.”  A government report showed orders for U.S. durable goods
climbed more than forecast in July as a surge in demand for
aircraft and cars eclipsed a drop in business equipment
purchases. Home prices rose 0.9 percent in June from the
previous month, beating estimates, a separate report showed.  Earnings Performance  Toyota Motor, which gets about 28 percent of sales from
 North America , gained 1.7 percent to 2,764 yen in Tokyo.  James
Hardie  jumped 3.2 percent to A$5.79 in Sydney.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a
supplier of toys and clothes to U.S. retailers including Wal-
Mart Stores Inc., rose 2.1 percent to HK$13.36 in Hong Kong.  Of the 600 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
reported net income since July 11, 45 percent exceeded analyst
estimates, while 33 percent fell short, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., the nation’s second-largest
mobile phone company, surged 12 percent to HK$15.38 in Hong
Kong, the biggest advance since October 2008, after second-
quarter net income beat analyst estimates.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil explorer, advanced
3 percent to HK$14.64. The company reported first-half net
income increased 51 percent from a year earlier to a record 39.3
billion yuan ($6 billion) as crude prices rose and it increased
output to meet demand in the fastest-growing major economy.  Apple Rivals Gain  Nasdaq-100 Index futures dropped 0.4 percent following
Jobs’s resignation as chief executive of Apple, the world’s
second-largest company by market value.  “Apple’s management was partly dependent on the
charismatic manager, so if he is going to step away, Apple may
have come to a threshold,” said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees
$600 million in Tokyo as chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co.  Samsung Electronics, Apple’s biggest competitor in
smartphones and tablet computers, climbed 2.4 percent to 725,000
won in Seoul.  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s fourth-largest
mobile phone maker by sales, added 1.3 percent to 55,700 won.
 HTC Corp. (2498) , the world’s No. 1 maker of handsets using Google
Inc.’s Android operating system, advanced 1.4 percent to NT$750
in Taipei.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Ltd., which assembles iPhones
for Apple, sank 4.6 percent to NT$61.80.  Wintek Corp. (2384) , a
supplier of touch screen sensors to Apple, tumbled 6.9 percent
to NT$22.30.  ‘Impossible’  Acer Inc. (2353) , the world’s fourth-largest computer maker,
slumped 7 percent to NT$29.35, heading for its lowest close
since June 2003. The company reported a second-quarter loss that
was wider than analyst estimates and told investors that a full-
year profit will be “impossible” amid a slowing computer
market and a weak global economy.  China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291) , the government-backed
partner of SABMiller Plc, slipped 1.1 percent to HK$30.55 after
saying net income fell 63 percent from a year earlier to HK$1.57
billion as the year-ago number was inflated by gains from
selling its textile, fashion and container-terminal units.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 13 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 6.4 percent drop by the S&P
500 and a 17 percent decline by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 11.9 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 11.8 times for the
S&P 500 and 9.53 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
