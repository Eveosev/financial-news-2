Mike Flanagan, who pitched for the
 Baltimore Orioles  and  Toronto Blue Jays  and won the Cy Young
Award, was found dead yesterday at his Baltimore County home. He
was 59.  “In over a quarter century with the organization, Flanny
became an integral part of the Orioles family, for his
accomplishments both on and off the field,” Baltimore majority
owner Peter Angelos said in a statement. “His loss will be felt
deeply and profoundly by all of us with the ballclub and by
Orioles fans everywhere.”  Flanagan, who worked in the broadcast booth as a color
analyst on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, won the Cy Young
award in 1979 as the best pitcher in the  American League  after
going 23-9 with a 3.08 earned run average with the Orioles.
During his 18-season career with Baltimore and Toronto, the
left-hander compiled a 167-143 record and 3.90 ERA.  No cause of death was disclosed by Baltimore County police.
Flanagan’s body was found on a trail leading to a barn on his
property.  Born in Manchester,  New Hampshire , on Dec. 16, 1951,
Flanagan was selected by the Orioles in the seventh round of the
1973 amateur draft. He made his Major League debut in 1975 and
pitched for Baltimore until August 1987 when he was traded to
Toronto. He returned to the Orioles as a reliever for two
seasons, ending his career in 1992.  World Series Ring  Flanagan was elected to the Orioles’ Hall of Fame in 1994.
He ranked third in team history in games pitched at 450, innings
pitched at 2,317 2/3 and starts at 328. He was fourth in
strikeouts with 1,297 and complete games at 98, fifth in
victories with 141 and seventh in shutouts with 17.  Flanagan won an AL-leading 23 games in 1979 when Baltimore
lost the  World Series  to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Four years
later, he won his only World Series ring when the Orioles beat
the  Philadelphia Phillies .  He was a member of the four-pitcher team that threw the
Orioles’ last no-hitter in 1991 and pitched the last two outs at
Memorial Stadium on Oct. 6 that year.  Flanagan coached pitching with the Orioles in 1995 and 1998,
and then worked as a broadcaster before becoming Baltimore’s
executive vice president after the 2005 season, a role he held
until his contract ended in 2008.  “Mike was an Oriole through and through and he’ll be
sorely missed,” said Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr.  Flanagan is survived by his wife, Alex, and daughters,
Kerry, Kathryn and Kendall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
