(Corrects spelling of  Warren Buffett  in third paragraph.)  The Bovespa stock index fluctuated
between gains and losses as a rally in bank stocks was offset by
reduced bets the central bank will lower  interest rates  to spur
growth.  The Bovespa fell 0.5 percent to 53,508.64 at 9:59 a.m. New
York time after earlier rising as much as 0.7 percent. Forty-
nine stocks dropped on the index, while 16 rose. The real was
little changed at 1.6140 per  U.S. dollar .  Financial stocks rallied after Banco Santander Brasil SA
announced a buyback and banks advanced worldwide after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to invest $5 billion in
Bank of America Corp.  “Buffett is moving everything right now, especially
financials,” said Greg Lesko, who helps oversee $800 million at
Deltec Asset Management in  New York . “Brazilian banks had been
particularly beat up of late, so this is certainly helping
them.”  The MSCI  Brazil /Financials Index rose 0.4 percent. The
measure has dropped 16 percent this month.  Yields on interest-rate futures contracts rose after the
national statistics agency said Brazil’s unemployment rate fell
to 6 percent in July from 6.2 percent in June. Economists had
forecast unemployment to hold at 6.2 percent, according to the
median of 33 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the futures contract due in January 2013 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 11.42 percent.  Bear Market  The Bovespa entered a bear market on July 27 after plunging
20 percent from its bull-market peak in November. The measure
extended that drop to 26 percent through yesterday.  The Bovespa trades at 8.8 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, near the lowest since March 2009, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 12.1 for
the Shanghai Composite Index, 5.7 for  Russia ’s Micex and 13.5
for  India ’s Sensex.  Traders moved 5.56 billion reais ($3.45 billion) in stocks
in Sao Paulo yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares to a daily average this year of 6.46 billion reais
through Aug. 10, according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
