Gunmen in  Nigeria  suspected to be
Islamic militants attacked a police station and a bank in the
northeastern town of Gombi today, killing 16 people, a local
official said.  Among the dead were five policemen, a soldier and 10
civilian bank customers, Ahmed Isa, chairman of the Gombi local
government council, said by phone. “The attackers were shouting
Allahu Akbar, meaning God is Great,” as they escaped, he said.  Nigerian authorities have blamed a militant Islamic sect,
Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban
movement, for an upsurge in violent attacks in the mainly Muslim
north in the past two years.  Africa’s most populous country of more than 150 million
people is roughly split between a north dominated by Muslims and
a predominantly Christian south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
