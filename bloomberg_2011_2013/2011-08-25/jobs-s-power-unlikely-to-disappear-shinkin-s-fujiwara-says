Naoki Fujiwara, who oversees about
60 billion yen ($780 million) in Tokyo as chief fund manager at
Shinkin Asset Management Co., comments on the resignation of
 Steve Jobs  as chief executive officer of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   “Apple shares are temporarily being sold because of Jobs’s
resignation, but the company’s stock price is likely to bounce
back.”  “The market trend of smartphones and tablets won’t change
with or without Jobs. He will not completely leave Apple, and
it’s hard to believe that his power at the company will suddenly
disappear.”  “Jobs has contributed to Apple’s hit products. We all know
that he can deliver. There is concern about the company’s next
round of product development.”  “Apple’s market share will not be affected by this news.
We all have to wait and see until Apple introduces its next new
product.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
