Cotton futures fell the most in more
than two weeks after a report showed overseas buyers scrapped
orders for supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.
 Orange juice  rose.  In the week ended Aug. 18, canceled orders for upland
cotton exceeded sales by 230,308 bales for the current crop
year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. A bale
weighs 480 pounds (218 kilograms). That’s the ninth time in 10
weeks that there were more canceled orders than sales.  “Export sales are just dismal again, and there have been
cancellations building,” Louis Barbera, a broker at VIP
Commodities in  New York , said in a telephone interview.  Cotton for December delivery fell 2 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to settle at $1.0299 a pound at 2:36 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
The drop was the biggest since Aug. 9. Cotton has tumbled 29
percent this year as demand slumped in  China , the leading
importer.  The export data may reflect a shift in orders to suppliers
outside the U.S., Barbera said. In  Texas , the biggest cotton-
producing state, agriculture losses from a drought have reached
a record $5.2 billion as farmers abandon sun-baked fields.  “The U.S. may not have the cotton to ship, so you’re
getting cancellations,” Barbera said.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 0.5 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to $1.6075 a pound on ICE. The commodity climbed
16 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
