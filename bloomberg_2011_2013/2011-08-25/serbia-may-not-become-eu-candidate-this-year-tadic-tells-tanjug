Serbia  may not achieve its goal of
becoming a candidate for European Union membership this year if
a condition for that is to end its presence in northern  Kosovo ,
President Boris Tadic said in an interview to state  Tanjug  news
agency.  Serbia will keep trying to achieve the status and even
start entry talks with the bloc, “but Serbia cannot abandon its
people in Kosovo,” Tadic was quoted as saying. He was referring
to the 60,000-strong Serb community living in northern Kosovo
that refuses to be ruled by the government of Kosovo, the former
Serbian province that declared independence in 2008.  Tadic spoke two days after German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
visited Belgrade and asked that Serbia discontinues its
institutions and government-funded bodies in the disputed area.  Serbia “will not give up its legitimate interests,” Tadic
reportedly said, adding that if such “unnatural” conditions
are met, it will create “a political and existential vacuum”
leading to an exodus of the Serb community.  To contact the reporter on this story:
