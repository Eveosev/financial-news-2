The Bank of  Sierra Leone’s  monetary
policy committee left its key lending rate unchanged at 23
percent for the third straight month, citing concern over
inflation in the West African nation.  “The committee underscored the need for the bank to
continue to maintain a tight monetary policy stance in order to
contain the second-round effects of imported inflation,” it
wrote in  a statement  handed to reporters in Freetown, the
capital, today.  The rate was last changed in May, a decrease of 300 basis
points from 26 percent, according to Komba Senessie, an official
at the bank. The reverse repo rate was set at 25 percent and the
overnight rate at 30 percent, the bank’s statement showed.  Inflation accelerated for the fifth month in six in July to
16.82 percent from 16.79 percent in June, according to the
statement.  The committee, which meets monthly, “recognized the growing
significance of food-price shocks over non-food price movements”
in consumer prices, it wrote.  The  World Bank ’s global food-price index for July rose 33
percent from a year earlier, the Washington-based lender said on
Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
