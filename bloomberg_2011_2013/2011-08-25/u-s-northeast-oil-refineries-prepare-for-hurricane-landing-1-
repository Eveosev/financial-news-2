Sunoco Inc. (SUN) , ConocoPhillips, PBF
Energy Co. LLC and  Hess Corp. (HES) , which operate six Northeast
refineries with a combined 1.4 million barrels a day of
capacity, are preparing for Hurricane Irene’s landing.  Sunoco has begun taking storm preparations to “protect
people” and “minimize impacts to operations” at its Marcus
Hook and Philadelphia refineries, Thomas Golembeski, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  PBF is “doing simple things now” such as making sure
drains are clear and ensuring there are enough flashlights, said
Michael Gayda, a company spokesman. The company doesn’t expect
operations to be affected at its Paulsboro,  New Jersey , or
Delaware City, Delaware, refineries, he said.  Hess is monitoring the storm and making “necessary
preparations” and doesn’t expect production to be affected at
its Port Reading, New Jersey, refinery, according to a company
statement.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  has begun taking steps “to ensure the
safety of our employees and facilities,” Janet Grothe, a
Houston-based spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail.  “While routine operations continue at our Bayway and
Trainer refineries, we continue to monitor Hurricane Irene as it
approaches the eastern seaboard,” Grothe said. “We have begun
implementation of our detailed and long-standing inclement
weather procedures.”  Grothe didn’t say whether ConocoPhillips expects output to
be affected at the company’s Bayway refinery in New Jersey or
the Trainer refinery in Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
