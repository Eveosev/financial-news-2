Negotiations between  Switzerland  and
the U.S. on offshore accounts of Swiss banks’ U.S. clients are
at a “crucial stage”,  Tages-Anzeiger  reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.  The data to be disclosed could be on the same magnitude as
the 4,450 accounts of  UBS AG (UBSN)  clients agreed on in a treaty
between both countries. The agreement to be struck would be
about clients of Swiss regional banks and  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN) , the newspaper said.  Switzerland made a comprehensive and tailor-made offer to
legalize all accounts of American clients in Switzerland which
now has to be accepted by the U.S., according to a letter by the
Swiss ambassador to the U.S., published yesterday in the New
York Times, Tages-Anzeiger also reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
