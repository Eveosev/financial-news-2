Gold may rebound after sliding more
than $175 an ounce from a record as investors buy the metal on
concern about a slowing economy and sovereign debts, a survey
found.  Thirteen of 26 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 50 percent, said bullion will rise next week.
Eight predicted a drop and five were neutral. Gold for December
delivery was down 5.9 percent for this week at $1,742 an ounce
by 11:45 a.m. yesterday on the Comex in  New York  after reaching
an all-time high of $1,917.90 on Aug. 23.  Gold fell $149.90 from the Aug. 22 close, set for the
biggest three-day drop since January 1980. Prices slumped as
U.S. durable-goods and home-price reports beat analyst estimates
and CME Group Inc. raised margins on futures contracts. Gold
futures’ 10-day historical volatility jumped to 41 percent, the
highest level since March 2009, Bloomberg data show.  “Once volatility settles, we think there will be willing
buyers in the short term,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst
at VTB Capital in London. “The situation in the euro zone,
where peripheral sovereign yields remain elevated, has yet to
improve,” and low  interest rates  will support gold, he said.  The  Federal Reserve  has taken the unprecedented step of
saying it will keep borrowing costs near zero at least through
mid-2013 to support the economy. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
will give a speech today at an annual symposium in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, amid speculation a slowing  U.S. economy  and Europe’s
debt crisis will hobble global growth. A year ago, he hinted at
a second round of asset purchases to stimulate the U.S. economy.  The attached chart tracks the results of the Bloomberg
survey, with the red bars derived by subtracting bearish
forecasts from bullish estimates. Readings below zero signal
that most respondents expect a decline. The green line shows the
gold price. The data are as of Aug. 19.  The weekly gold survey, which started seven years ago, has
forecast prices accurately in 218 of 377 weeks, or 58 percent of
the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 13 Bearish: 8 Neutral: 5  To contact the reporter on this story:
