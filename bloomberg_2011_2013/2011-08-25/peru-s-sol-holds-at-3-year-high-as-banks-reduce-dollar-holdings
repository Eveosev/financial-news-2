Peru ’s sol held at its strongest
level in more than three years as the nation’s banks sold
dollars on optimism the Andean country will be able to weather
slower global growth.  The currency was unchanged at 2.7320 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:52 p.m. New York time, after ending trading yesterday at its
strongest level since April 2008.  Concern Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and slower U.S.
growth may derail the global recovery led Peruvian banks to
build up their dollar holdings this month. The banks have been
selling those dollars this week as they bet a global slowdown
won’t derail Peru’s economy, leading the central bank to
purchase dollars for a fourth-straight day, said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima.  “The external outlook remains gloomy, with the threat of a
new recession, but it seems that nobody wants to bet on the sol
weakening much in such a scenario,” Navarro said.  The central bank announces any currency purchases after
2:30 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
