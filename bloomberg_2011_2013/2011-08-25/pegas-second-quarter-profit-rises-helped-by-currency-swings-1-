Pegas Nonwovens SA (PEGAS) , a Czech maker of
special textiles used in hygiene products and health care, said
second-quarter profit more than doubled, helped by currency
swings and as amortization charges a year ago werenâ€™t repeated.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 was 4.41
million euros ($6.36 million) up from 1.78 million euros, the
Znojmo, Czech Republic based-registered company said in an e-
mailed statement today. Revenue rose 21 percent to 41.6 million
euros.  A drop in polymer prices will have a positive impact on
third-quarter results, Pegas said. The company also reiterated
its 2011 forecast for earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to rise between 2 percent and 7
percent.  Founded in 1990, Pegas makes non-woven fabrics mainly for
hygiene products, the construction and medical industries. The
company operates two plants with nine production lines in the
 Czech Republic , supplying 70,000 tons of non-woven textiles
annually. The company said in June that it plans to build a
factory in  Egypt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
