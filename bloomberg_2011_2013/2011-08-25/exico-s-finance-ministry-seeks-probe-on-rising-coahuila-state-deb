Mexico’s Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  asked the attorney general’s office to probe possible
irregularities in the accumulation of debt by Coahuila state
after  Standard & Poor’s  cut its rating last week.  The ministry is seeking to verify if part of Coahuila’s
debt resulted from “irregular” transactions with Mexican
banks, Cordero told reporters in Contepec, Michoacan. He didn’t
give further details about the investigation, according to an
audio recording and transcript provided by the press department
of the ruling  National Action Party .  S&P slashed Coahuila’s national scale rating by five levels
to BBB- from A+ on Aug. 18, saying new information showed the
state had accumulated 33.9 billion pesos ($2.7 billion) of debt,
four times more than the figure last reported in May.  “We’re convinced and determined that justice needs to be
done and what happened should be cleared up,” Cordero said.  Irma Alicia Flores Mena, a spokeswoman for the Coahuila
state government, didn’t immediately respond to a phone call and
e-mail seeking comment. Jose Gonzalez, deputy director of press
at the attorney general’s office, didn’t immediately provide a
comment.  Cordero was in Contepec, in the Pacific state of Michoacan,
for a meeting with lawmakers to discuss the 2012 budget.  To contact the reporters on this story:
