European stocks declined, snapping
three days of gains, as  Germany ’s DAX Index tumbled 4 percent in
15 minutes amid speculation that regulators planned to impose
further restrictions on equity markets.  Five German stocks slid for every one that gained as
companies from RWE AG to Allianz SE sank. Royal Ahold NV, the
Dutch owner of Stop & Shop grocery stores, paced a retreat in
retail shares, slumping more than 6 percent, after reporting an
unexpected drop in profit.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ,  France ’s second-
largest bank by assets, surged 4.8 percent after profit fell
less than analysts had estimated.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 1.2 percent to 227.07 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The benchmark measure has still
gained 1.8 percent from the two-year low it reached on Aug. 19.
The gauge has fallen 22 percent from this year’s peak on Feb. 17
as European and U.S. economic data trailed forecasts, adding to
concern the global economic recovery is at risk.  Futures on the DAX plunged as much as 4.1 percent as a
cascade of trades pushed the volume in the contracts to a
quarter of the daily average between 3:45 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. in
 Frankfurt .  “It looks like someone fears the update today from French
and Spanish regulators will extend the short-selling ban,” said
Michael Scholz,  executive director  for client solutions and
derivatives at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf. “It was a strange move
selling the DAX futures in 30 minutes. Someone may be preparing
their portfolio for tomorrow.”  A total of 50,000 contracts exchanged hands in the 30-
minute period, according to Bloomberg data. The average volume
in the past 30 days was 207,000, Bloomberg data show.  Short-Selling Restrictions  Authorities in France, Spain and  Italy  all had to decide
whether to extend short-selling bans that would have expired
over the next 48 hours.  National benchmark indexes slid in all 18 western European
markets except  Austria . Germany’s DAX Index slid 1.7 percent
after earlier tumbling as much as 4 percent. France’s  CAC 40
Index (CAC)  lost 0.7 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index retreated
1.4 percent.  Stocks erased earlier gains after U.S. jobless claims
unexpectedly climbed by 5,000 to 417,000 in the week ended Aug.
20, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
Economists had predicted that they would fall to 405,000.  A Commerce Department report tomorrow may show that gross
domestic product grew at a 1.1 percent annual pace in the April
to June quarter, down from the 1.3 percent rate estimated last
month, according to the median projection in a Bloomberg survey.  RWE, EON, Allianz  RWE and EON AG, the country’s biggest utilities, slumped
3.9 percent to 25.37 euros and 3.1 percent to 14.68 euros,
respectively. Allianz AG tumbled 3.2 percent to 67.75 euros.  Retail stocks fell 2.3 percent for one of the biggest
declines among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600 as Ahold
plunged 6.2 percent to 7.83 euros.  Ahold reported an unexpected drop in second-quarter profit
because of increased U.S. competition. Net income declined to
199 million euros ($286 million) from 202 million euros a year
earlier, the Amsterdam-based company said today. That missed the
average of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg for
profit of 217 million euros.  Credit Agricole  Gains  Credit Agricole surged 4.8 percent to 6.51 euros. The bank
said second-quarter profit fell 11 percent to 339 million euros.
Earnings exceeded the 187 million-euro average estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Credit Agricole booked a 202
million-euro pretax writedown on Greek sovereign debt.  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  plunged 9.7 percent to 316 pence. The
London-based oil explorer said it’s concerned whether Sevan
Marine ASA can deliver a unit to start pumping crude at the
U.K.’s Huntington field in 2012.  Diageo Plc surged 4.7 percent to 1,170 pence. The maker of
Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff vodka said annual profit
rose. So-called organic operating profit, excluding some items
and the effects of acquisitions and currency swings, climbed 5
percent in the year through June.  International Power Plc (IPR) , the U.K. utility controlled by  GDF
Suez (GSZ)  SA, rallied 2.5 percent to 314.9 pence after JPMorgan Chase
& Co. lifted its recommendation on the shares to “overweight”
from “neutral.”  Barclays Plc (BARC)  soared 5.6 percent to 157.9 pence. Britain’s
second-largest bank by assets doesn’t need to raise additional
capital, Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  told CNBC in an
interview.  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  climbed 5.3 percent to 430.5 pence. The
U.K.’s third-largest homebuilder by volume was raised to “buy”
from “hold” at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
