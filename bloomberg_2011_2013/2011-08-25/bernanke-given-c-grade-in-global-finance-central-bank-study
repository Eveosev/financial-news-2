Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  received a “C” in Global Finance magazine’s annual
grading of the world’s central bankers.  Bernanke’s grade was unchanged from last year, while
outgoing European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet was
given a “B-” after last year’s “A.” Bank of  Japan  Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa also received a “C” while Mark Carney of
Canada and the U.K.’s Mervyn King were both given a “B.”  The report card for 37 central bankers, first published in
1994, was based on their scale of success in areas such as
controlling inflation, meeting economic growth goals and
managing interest rates. The report was published as Bernanke,
Trichet and counterparts from around the world arrive in  Jackson
Hole , Wyoming, for their annual monetary policy symposium at a
time when the global economic outlook is deteriorating.  “During one of the toughest years on record, the world’s
central bankers were tested as never before,” Global Finance
publisher Joseph Giarraputo said in a statement.  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  and Bank
of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer were among the six central
bankers to receive the top grade from the magazine. The others
were Lebanon’s Riad Salameh, Malaysia’s Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Amando Tetangco of the Philippines and Taiwan’s Fai-Nan Perng.  Argentina’s Mercedes Marco del Pont was graded lowest, with
a “D.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
