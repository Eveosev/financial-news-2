Dennis Snower, the head of the Kiel-
based Institute for World Economics, said proposed debt-limit
rules in  Europe  would hurt countries in the long-term as they
can no longer react in a crisis,  Frankfurter Rundschau  reported
today, citing Snower.  Instead, Snower proposed that all countries that want to
borrow money from the European Union have to commit to a budget
rule, the newspaper said, citing Snower. The rule will dictate
how the debt-ratio will develop, how borrowing can be cut in the
short-term and how much fiscal stimulus should be used in
difficult times, Snower said, according to the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
