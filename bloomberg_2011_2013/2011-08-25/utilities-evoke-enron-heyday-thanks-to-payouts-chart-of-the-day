Utility stocks are having the best
year relative to the rest of Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
industries since Enron Corp. was in its heyday a decade ago.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, dividends may help explain
the status as market leaders. The top panel illustrates that the
dividend yield on the S&P 500 Utilities Index this year has been
steadier than rates on 10-year Treasury notes, which fell about
a percentage point in 2011 to reach 2.30 percent yesterday.  The gap between the yields peaked at 2.64 points earlier
this month. This differential was the widest since March 2009,
when the  bull market  in stocks began.  Demand from investors looking for income contributed to a
6.2 percent increase in the utility index for the year through
yesterday. The gauge climbed about three points more than the
second-best performer, an index of food, beverage and  tobacco
companies  and other makers of consumer staples.  The last time utilities led the market at this point in a
year was 2000, when the industry’s index included Enron. Shares
of the energy trader climbed to a record $90.75 a share on Aug.
23 and closed the next day with a 93 percent gain for the year.
Within 16 months, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Utility stocks have the second-highest payouts among the
S&P 500’s 10 broadest industry groups. The dividend yield for
their index as of yesterday was 4.25 percent, trailing only
telephone companies at 5.40 percent.  There are 33 stocks in the utility gauge and they all pay
dividends except AES Corp. and NRG Energy Inc., two independent
power producers. The S&P 500 Telecommunications Services Index
has only eight companies, and three don’t make payouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
