Woolworths Holdings Ltd., a South
African clothing and food retailer, climbed to a record after
fiscal full-year profit and sales beat expectations.  The stock advanced as much as 4 percent to 33.39 rand, the
highest intraday since the shares started trading in 1997, and
was at 32.62 rand as of 11:33 a.m. in Johannesburg.  Adjusted earnings per share excluding one-time items rose
to 2.10 rand a share in the year through June 26, Cape Town-
based Woolworths said in a statement today. The median estimate
of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for adjusted earnings
per share of 1.91 rand. Sales rose 9 percent to 25.8 billion
rand ($3.6 billion) beating the median estimate of seven
analysts for revenue of 25.6 billion rand.  Woolworths plans a “big push into  Africa ” in 2012 and
will open 16 new stores, taking the total number of its outlets
outside its home market to 60, it said in a presentation posted
on its  website .  The outlook for next year is “uncertain” and trading
conditions are expected to be worse in the second half of next
year, Woolworths said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
