Nigerian trade in the first quarter
rose 67 percent from a year earlier, worth 6.3 trillion naira
($41 billion), with crude oil exports accounting for more than a
third of the shipments, according to the  National Bureau of
Statistics .  The value of crude-oil exports during the period rose 46
percent to 2.4 trillion naira, while non-oil shipments increased
24 percent to 795 billion naira, the statistics office said
today in a statement handed to Bloomberg News in Abuja, the
capital.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous nation with about 140
million people, depends on oil exports for more than 80 percent
of government revenue and 95 percent of foreign-exchange income.
The West African nation’s average daily oil production was 2.51
million barrels in the first quarter compared with 2.39 million
a year earlier, the state-owned  Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp.  said on its website.  Oil exports to the U.S. were worth 1.16 trillion naira,
according to the statement.  Nigeria  is the fifth-biggest source
of U.S. oil imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
