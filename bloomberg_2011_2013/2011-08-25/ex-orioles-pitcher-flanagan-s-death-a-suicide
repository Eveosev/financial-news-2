Mike Flanagan, a former pitcher for
the  Baltimore Orioles  and  Toronto Blue Jays , died of a self-
inflicted gunshot wound outside his house, the Baltimore County
Police Department said today in an e-mailed release.  Flanagan’s body was found yesterday 250 feet behind his
home in Sparks,  Maryland , according to the release. A police
investigation, which is now complete, ruled the cause of death a
shotgun wound to the head. Flanagan was 59.  Flanagan, who worked in the broadcast booth as a color
analyst on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, won the Cy Young
Award in 1979 as the best pitcher in the  American League  after
going 23-9 with a 3.08 earned run average with the Orioles.
During his 18-season career with Baltimore and Toronto, the
left-hander compiled a 167-143 record and 3.90 ERA.  “We thank you for your support and kind words at this
difficult time,” the Flanagan family said in a statement on the
Orioles’ website. “Thank you for respecting our privacy as we
grieve.”  Flanagan’s wife, Alex, who was traveling, spoke with her
husband around 1 a.m. yesterday, and said he sounded upset,
according to the police report. When she didn’t hear from him
later that day, she asked a neighbor to check on him. The
neighbor called the police when she couldn’t locate Flanagan.  Police arrived at the house at 4:26 p.m. and found the
body, according to the report. Flanagan didn’t leave a note, and
the investigation showed that he was upset about financial
issues, the report said.  911 Call  On June 30, police responded to a 911 call from Alex
Flanagan expressing concern that her husband when she couldn’t
reach him by phone, the release said. Flanagan answered the door
and said he was having phone trouble.  “In over a quarter century with the organization, Flanny
became an integral part of the Orioles family, for his
accomplishments both on and off the field,” Baltimore majority
owner Peter Angelos said in a statement. “His loss will be felt
deeply and profoundly by all of us with the ballclub and by
Orioles fans everywhere.”  Born in Manchester,  New Hampshire , on Dec. 16, 1951,
Flanagan was selected by the Orioles in the seventh round of the
1973 amateur draft. He made his major-league debut in 1975 and
pitched for Baltimore until August 1987, when he was traded to
Toronto. He returned to the Orioles as a reliever for two
seasons, ending his career in 1992.  Orioles’ Leader  Flanagan was elected to the Orioles’ Hall of Fame in 1994.
He ranked third in team history in games pitched at 450, innings
pitched at 2,317 2/3 and starts at 328. He was fourth in
strikeouts with 1,297 and complete games at 98, fifth in
victories with 141 and seventh in shutouts with 17.  Flanagan won an AL-leading 23 games in 1979, when Baltimore
lost the  World Series  to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Four years
later, he won his only World Series ring when the Orioles beat
the  Philadelphia Phillies .  He was a member of the four-pitcher team that threw the
Orioles’ last no-hitter in 1991 and pitched the last two outs at
Memorial Stadium on Oct. 6 that year.  Flanagan coached pitching with the Orioles in 1995 and
1998, and then worked as a broadcaster before becoming
Baltimore’s executive vice president for baseball operations
after the 2005 season, a role he held until his contract ended
in 2008.  “Mike was an Oriole through and through and he’ll be
sorely missed,” said Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr.  Flanagan is survived by his wife and daughters Kerry,
Kathryn and Kendall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
