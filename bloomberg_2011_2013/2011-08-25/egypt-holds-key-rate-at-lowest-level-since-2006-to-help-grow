Egypt’s central bank held its
benchmark  interest rate  at the lowest level since November 2006
in a bid to help the economy after the overthrow of President
 Hosni Mubarak .  The Monetary Policy Committee left the benchmark overnight
deposit rate at 8.25 percent and the overnight lending rate at
9.75 percent, the central bank in Cairo said today on its
website. All five economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipated
the decision.  “For the foreseeable future, we see no change,” Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC  Middle East , said in a
telephone interview. “We don’t see a very strong pickup in
either growth or inflation, so that keeps rates on hold for
sometime.”  Since the uprising began in January, tourists have fled,
foreign investors dumped Treasury bills and factory output has
been hit by protests and strikes. The benchmark EGX 30 stock
index is down nearly 35 percent this year. Economic growth may
slow to 1 percent in 2011, the lowest rate in almost two
decades, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The economy shrank an annual 4.2 percent in the first
quarter and investment plunged 26 percent. Cairo-based
investment bank EFG-Hermes Holding SAE said on Aug. 9 that the
economy may contract 3.3 percent this year instead of the 2.5
percent it estimated earlier. Previous governments have said
they need growth of about 7 percent to create enough jobs for a
growing working-age population.  The annual inflation rate in urban parts of  Egypt  declined
to 10.4 percent in July, its lowest level this year, from 11.8
percent in June.  The central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate on
hold since September 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
