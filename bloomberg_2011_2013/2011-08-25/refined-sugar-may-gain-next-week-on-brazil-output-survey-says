Refined sugar may advance next week
as output drops in  Brazil , the top global producer.  Four of eight traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said white, or refined, sugar in  London  would
rise. Three said it would fall, and one was neutral. Before
today, futures for October delivery fell 2 percent this week to
$771.20 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London  Three respondents said raw sugar would gain on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York , the same number that forecast a slide. Two
expected little change. Futures for October delivery fell 4.2
percent this week through yesterday.  Two respondents said refined-sugarâ€™s premium over raw would
widen, two said it would narrow, and four were neutral.  To contact the reporters on this story:
