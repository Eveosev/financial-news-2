Renaissance Services SAOG (RNSS)  rose to
the highest level in more than a week as  BankMuscat SAOG (BKMB) 
maintained its “buy” recommendation on the Omani services
company even after the firm uncovered fraud at a unit.  The shares rallied 5.3 percent to 0.611 rial, the highest
level since Aug. 15, at the 1 p.m. close in Muscat. Renaissance,
which provides services to the oil and gas industry, is down 24
percent this month.  BankMuscat cited “strong growth” at the marine business
of Renaissance. The share-price estimate was lowered 41 percent
to 0.91 rial.  The shares on Aug. 15 retreated the most since April 2005
after the company said its unit Topaz Group was linked to
financial fraud. Renaissance’s Chief Executive Officer Stephen
Thomas said on Aug. 18 he is confident that the only fraud case
is the one that has already been identified at the unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
