Peru ’s sol held at its strongest
level in more than three years as the nation’s banks bought the
currency on optimism the Andean country will be able to weather
slower global growth.  The currency was unchanged at 2.7320 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, after ending trading yesterday at its strongest
level since April 2008.  Concern Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and slower U.S.
growth threaten the global recovery led Peruvian banks to build
up their dollar holdings this month. The banks have been selling
those dollars this week as they bet a global slowdown won’t
derail Peru’s economy, leading the central bank to purchase
dollars for a fourth-straight day, said Gonzalo Navarro, head
trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima.  “The external outlook remains gloomy, with the threat of a
new recession, but it seems that nobody wants to bet on the sol
weakening much in such a scenario,” Navarro said.  The central bank bought $29.7 million in the  spot market  to
temper gains in the sol, which earlier rose to 2.7310 per
dollar. The bank paid 2.7320 soles per dollar, it said on its
website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 declined two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.65 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries climbed three basis points to
197, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
