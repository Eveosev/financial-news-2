Total Kenya Ltd., the local unit of
 Total SA (FP) , said profit in the six months through June fell 74
percent after the east African nation introduced price  controls
in December.   Net income dropped to 79.7 million shillings ($863,957) in
the period, compared with 302.3 million shillings a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement published in 
Nairobi-based  Daily Nation .  Sales rose to 38.4 billion shillings, compared with 31.3
billion shillings a year earlier, Managing Director Alexis Vovk
said in the statement.  “Turnnover went up by 23 percent despite the reduction in
sales volume due to increased product cost occasioned by the
high international  oil prices ,” Vovk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
