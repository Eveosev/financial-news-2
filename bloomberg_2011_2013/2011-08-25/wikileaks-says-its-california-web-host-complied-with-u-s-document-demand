WikiLeaks said its Web host in
 California  complied with a court order obtained by the U.S. for
production of information on Julian Assange, the company’s
founder.  The California host, Dynadot, received an order to produce
the information under the Patriot Act, WikiLeaks said on a
Twitter news feed. The U.S. has been investigating Assange and
others who may have helped leak diplomatic cables and classified
military documents through the WikiLeaks website.  The order by a magistrate judge in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria,  Virginia , filed under seal on Jan. 4, demanded
customer or subscriber account information for each account
registered to, or associated with WikiLeaks, its founder, or the
company’s domain name from Nov. 1, 2009, according to a copy of
the court order posted on Twitter.  A record of the sealed order couldn’t be confirmed
immediately in court documents. Calls and e-mails to Gareth Peirce, a lawyer for Assange, and Dynadot President Todd Han
weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
