Optimum Coal Holdings (OPT)  Ltd.,  South
Africa ’s fourth-largest exporter of coal used in power stations,
more than doubled full-year profit on higher prices and sales.  Optimum, based in Johannesburg, posted net income of 459.6
million rand ($63 million) in the year ended June 30, from 215.5
million rand, it said in a statement. Revenue rose 57 percent to
5.3 billion rand. The company paid a special dividend of 0.30
rand a share to distribute profit from platinum rights sales.  The company is in talks with banks on refinancing debt to
allow for more acquisitions, Chief Executive Officer Mike Teke
said in a telephone interview today, after two purchases of coal
prospecting licenses in the past four months.  The domestic coal market is expected to “remain strong
with robust demand,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
