Mike Flanagan, a former pitcher for
the  Baltimore Orioles  and  Toronto Blue Jays , died of a self-
inflicted gunshot wound outside his house, the Baltimore County
Police Department said today in an e-mailed release.  Flanagan’s body was found yesterday 250 feet behind his
Baltimore County house, according to the release. A police
investigation, which is now complete, ruled the cause of death a
shotgun wound to the head. Flanagan was 59.  Flanagan, who worked in the broadcast booth as a color
analyst on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network, won the Cy Young
Award in 1979 as the best pitcher in the  American League  after
going 23-9 with a 3.08 earned run average with the Orioles.
During his 18-season career with Baltimore and Toronto, the
left-hander compiled a 167-143 record and 3.90 ERA.   Flanagan is survived by his wife, Alex, and daughters,
Kerry, Kathryn and Kendall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
