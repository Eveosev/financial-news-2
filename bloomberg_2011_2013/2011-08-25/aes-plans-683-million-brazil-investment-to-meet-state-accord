AES Tiete SA (GETI3) , the Brazilian unit of
 AES Corp. (AES) , plans to invest 1.1 billion reais ($683 million) to
boost energy-generation capacity in the state of Sao Paulo to
meet the terms of a privatization accord.  The plan includes a thermoelectric plant in the state with
capacity to generate 550 megawatts, more than the 398 megawatts
required under the agreement, the Sao Paulo-based utility said
in a statement yesterday. AES Tiete said it has requested an
environmental license to build the plant.  AES was ordered to boost power-generation capacity by a
court in Sao Paulo after failing to meet terms of the state-
owned utility’s purchase in 1999, Sao Paulo’s state government
said Aug. 23 in an e-mailed statement.  AES Tiete said it hasn’t been notified of the court ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
