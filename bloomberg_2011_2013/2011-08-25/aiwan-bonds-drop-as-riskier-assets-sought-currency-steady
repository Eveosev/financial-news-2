surveyed by Bloomberg and a revised 1.3 percent contraction in
June. Benchmark five-year yields dropped 18 basis points this
month as investors sought the relative safety of debt on signs

raised borrowing costs at its last five quarterly meetings.  “Stocks aren’t as volatile as they have been recently, and
some people think it’s a good time to cut their bond holdings,”
said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co.
in Taipei. “Whether the central bank will stop raising rates at
the September meeting is basically the only thing traders care
about now.”  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 gained two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.03 percent as of
the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities
