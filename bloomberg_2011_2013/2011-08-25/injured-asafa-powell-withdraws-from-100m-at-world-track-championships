Asafa Powell, the fastest man in the
world this season in the 100-meter sprint, withdrew from the
event at the  IAAF World Championships  because of an injury.  “Powell suffered a groin strain in Budapest on July 30 and
has had recurring tightness and pain ever since,” his
representatives, Doyle Management, said in a  statement  on the
IAAF website.  The Jamaican was to be the main rival of his team-mate and
world and Olympic champion Usain Bolt in the 100 meters at the
world championships, which start in two days’ time in Daegu,
 South Korea . The 100-meter final is on Aug. 28.  Tyson Gay, a former 100-meter and 200-meter world champion,
is also absent. The American, who ran the second-fastest time
this season, is recovering from a hip operation.  Even after undergoing “all sorts of treatments over the
past weeks,” Powell decided not to compete because “he feels
he would not be at 100 percent and may have trouble coming back
after each round,” his management company said.  Powell, 28, ran a world  season-best  9.78 seconds in the 100
meters in Lausanne,  Switzerland , in June. Bolt narrowly beat his
friend Powell in their only race this season, in  Rome  in May.
Powell won 100-meter bronze medals at the 2007 and 2009 world
championships and is also a former 100-meter world record
holder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
