The premium European banks pay to
borrow in dollars for one year through the swaps market fell for
the third consecutive day, a sign that funding pressures in the
U.S. currency may be easing.  The cost of converting euro-based payments into dollars, as
measured by the one-year cross-currency basis swap, rose 0.25
basis point to 47 basis points below the euro interbank offered
rate, or Euribor, at 11:15 a.m. in  London . The spread reached 52
basis points on Aug. 23, the most since Dec. 16, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Basis swaps allow investors to borrow in one currency and
simultaneously lend in another. A wider spread signals that
lenders may be facing increasing pressure to raise funds in the
U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
