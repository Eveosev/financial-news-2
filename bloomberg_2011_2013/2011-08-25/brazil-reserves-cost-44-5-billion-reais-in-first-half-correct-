(Corrects to add real currency to headline.)  Brazil ’s international reserves cost
the country 44.5 billion reais ($27.7 billion) in the first half
of 2011, central bank director Altamir Lopes said.  The figure takes into account a 6.31 percent “currency
correction,” Lopes said, as the dollar and other currencies
weakened against the real. Without the currency movement, the
cost to Brazil would have been 15.7 billion reais, Lopes told
reporters in Brasilia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
