China’s National Energy
Administration said power grid operators should invest and build
pumped-storage hydropower stations instead of doing it jointly

National Development and Reform Commission’s website.  The country will strictly review pumped-storage hydropower
projects invested by power generators, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
