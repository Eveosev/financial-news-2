Grains output in  Germany , the
European Union’s second-biggest wheat exporter, will drop 12
percent this year on dry weather during the growing season and
too much rain during the harvest, a farmers group said.  The grain harvest will fall to 39 million metric tons, the
lowest since 2003, the DBV German Farmers Association said at a
press conference in Berlin today. The wheat crop will be 12
percent smaller at 21 million tons and rapeseed output will fall
34 percent to 3.7 million tons, it said.  “The farmers have had to fight for every grain this
season,” said Klaus Kliem, a member of the DBV board. “The
weather has just been terrible and you can only compensate for
nature by so much.”  The bad weather “during the whole growing period put our
harvest this year on the same level as the extremely dry and hot
year of 2003,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
