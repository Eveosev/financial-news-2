Gasoline rose to a three-week high
on speculation that Hurricane Irene, a Category 3 storm, may
disrupt East Coast refinery production and fuel distribution.  Futures gained as  Irene , the strongest Atlantic storm to
threaten the U.S. since 2005, battered the Bahamas on a course
expected to take it near North Carolina this weekend and New
England next week. The U.S. East Coast, or  Padd 1 region , has 10
operating refineries with a capacity of 1.21 million barrels a
day, accounting for 7.1 percent of total U.S. operating
capacity, according to Energy Department data.  “There’s concern about flooding, refinery disruption,
terminal shutdowns and that’s why this market is popping,” said
 Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply at Truman
Arnold Cos. in Texarkana,  Texas . “I don’t think anyone will
sell in front of this storm.”  Gasoline for September delivery rose 8.95 cents, or 3.1
percent, to settle at $2.9679 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It was the highest settlement since Aug. 2
and largest gain since Aug. 10.  September’s premium over the October contract widened 4.36
cents to 16.62 cents, the largest spread since Aug. 11.  Bouchard Transportation Co. has been forced by the approach
of Irene to stop its oil barge traffic off the U.S. Mid-Atlantic
coast and will have to shut New York Harbor operations within 24
hours to 48 hours, Chief Executive Officer Morton Bouchard III
said in a telephone interview. The company has 25 barges with a
capacity of 30,000 barrels to 250,000 barrels each, he said.  Hurricane Alerts  Hurricane watches are in force for the  North Carolina  coast
as 115 miles-per-hour (185 kilometers per hour) winds ripped
through the Bahamas, damaging homes, felling trees and
triggering flooding, according to the Bahamas Emergency
Management Agency.  The storm is 610 miles south of Cape Hatteras, North
Carolina, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said at 2 p.m.
and is moving north-northwest at 14 mph on a path that will take
it along the U.S. East Coast this weekend.  “You’re getting a little bit of bid because shorts don’t
want to be exposed in case something happens,” said  Gene
McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Preliminary volume in electronic trading for gasoline was
150,136 contracts as of 3:04 p.m. in  New York , 28 percent above
the daily average of the past three months. Heating oil volume
was 131,777, 15 percent above the average.  Heating oil for September delivery gained 2.48 cents, or
0.8 percent, to settle at $2.9855 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.7
cent to $3.582 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
