Crown Berger Ltd. (CRBG) , a Kenyan paint
manufacturer, said half-year profit rose to 45.9 million
shillings ($497,561) from 42.5 million shillings a year earlier.  Revenue in the six months through June 30 was 1.81 billion
shillings compared with 1.43 billion shillings the previous
year, the company said in a statement e-mailed by the Nairobi

the current economic situation in the country and the board has
taken effective measures to sustain profitability,” the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
