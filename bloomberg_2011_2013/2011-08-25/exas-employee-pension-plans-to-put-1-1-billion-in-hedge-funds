The Employees Retirement System of
Texas will place 5 percent of its $23.2 billion in assets with
hedge-fund managers over the next three years under a new plan.  The retirement systemâ€™s trustees passed the allocation
proposal at an Aug. 23 meeting as a way to diversify,
spokeswoman Mary Jane Wardlow said. The panel previously agreed
to invest 8 percent of assets with private-equity managers and 8
percent in real estate, she said.  The board of ERS, as it is known, first passed the hedge-
fund allocation plan in August 2008, then put off making the
investments because of unstable market conditions, Wardlow said.
The objective is for a rate of return on the assets that exceeds
the yield on three-month U.S. Treasury bills by 4 percentage
points, net of fees, according to board  documents . The yield on
the bills has averaged about 0.05 percent this year.  Allocations of $75 million to $100 million are likely to be
made with 10 to 18 funds during the next three years, under the
proposal. By the end of 2014, the trustees expect to have
invested $1.16 billion with the funds. No money has been
distributed yet to the managers, Wardlow said.  The pension system serves state employees excluding those
in public schools and some university workers. It had an annual
return on assets of 20.5 percent for the year ending June 30,
ranking in the 60th percentile among 76 pension funds with more
than $1 billion in assets, according to a survey by Hewitt
EnnisKnupp Inc., an investment consulting company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
