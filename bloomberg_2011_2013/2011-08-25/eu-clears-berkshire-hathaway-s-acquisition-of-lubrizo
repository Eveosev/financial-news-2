The European Commission cleared the
acquisition of  Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   Buffett agreed to buy Wickliffe, Ohio-based Lubrizol, the
world’s largest producer of lubricant additives, in March for
about $9 billion. Berkshire is paying $135 a share in cash, the
Omaha, Nebraska-based company said on March 14. The purchase
also includes $700 million of net debt.  The Brussels-based commission, the European Union’s
regulatory arm, said in a statement today that “the transaction
would not raise competition concerns because of the parties’
moderate market shares and the presence of a number of credible
competitors in the markets concerned.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
