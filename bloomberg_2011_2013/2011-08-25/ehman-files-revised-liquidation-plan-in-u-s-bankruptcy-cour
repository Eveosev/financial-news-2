Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , which
is gathering support for a $65 billion liquidation plan,
provided additional information to creditors and says the
proposal should proceed to a vote.  Lehman is scheduled to go to court at the end of the month
to seek permission for creditor voting to begin. Lehman said the
plan, which has the backing of creditors with more than
$100 billion in claims, provides adequate information for
creditors to evaluate it and should move forward.  “Lehman now stands on the verge of achieving the principal
objective of Chapter 11, the implementation of a consensual
joint plan,” it said yesterday in papers in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in  Manhattan .  A group of Lehman creditors earlier this month said Lehman
should disclose more details about its proposal before sending
it to a vote. The company, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008,
added additional information to a plan summary and said in a
court filing the plan should move forward. Many objections
should be deferred to a later court hearing where the plan will
be considered for approval by a judge, Lehman said.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
