Vikas Babu, a foreign-exchange
trader at state-owned  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai, comments on the
outlook for India’s rupee. Three-month non-deliverable forwards
for the currency declined 0.4 percent to 46.59 per dollar as of
10:15 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The spot rate was 46.15.  “The rupee will appreciate from the current level to 45
against the dollar in November. For the time being the pain is
there for the currency but overall I am bullish on the rupee.  ‘‘The currency may touch 47 and come back as the markets
are in a panic now. We will see money flocking back to the
Indian equities once investors realize that  India’s economy  is
growing.’’  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
