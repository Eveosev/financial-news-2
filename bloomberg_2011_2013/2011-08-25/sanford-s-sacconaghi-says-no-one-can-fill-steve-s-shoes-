Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York, comments on the
resignation of  Steve Jobs  as chief executive officer of  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  Sacconaghi spoke on Bloomberg Television.  Apple shares fell as much as 7 percent in extended trading
in the U.S. yesterday.  On the drop in share price:  “I don’t think it’s a reflection of Tim Cook or a
reflection of uncertainty about the company being able to
continue to execute well.  “Tim Cook has been acting CEO twice, both times that Steve
Jobs has been on leave. In both periods, the company has
executed flawlessly. Share prices in both instances have
significantly outperformed including this year’s outperformance
by about 20 percent since Steve Jobs went on leave.  “So I don’t think there’s a lack of confidence in the
 succession plan . People widely expected, almost universally
expected,  Tim Cook  to become CEO when this would happen. It is
recognition of how iconic Steve Jobs is.  “Even though he has a great successor, there’s an implicit
acknowledgement that no one can fill Steve’s shoes.”  On the timing of the resignation:  “Certainly within the investment community, Steve Jobs not
returning to Apple in a full-time operating capacity was largely
expected.”  Editors: Subramaniam Sharma  To contact the reporter on this story:
