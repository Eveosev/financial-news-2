Pandora Media Inc., the online music
company that went public in June, reported second-quarter sales
and profit that beat analysts’ estimates. The shares rose.  Profit excluding some items was 2 cents a share, topping
projections for a break-even quarter, the average of eight
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales more than
doubled to $67 million, the company said today in a statement,
exceeding the $61.2 million average forecast.  Pandora, reporting for the first time as a public company,
sells ads that appear on listeners’ computers and mobile
devices, as well as commercials between songs. The stock has
fallen 22 percent since the June 14 initial public offering,
compared with the 13 percent decline in the S&P 500 Media Index.  The net loss for the quarter ended July 31 was $3.18
million, or 4 cents a share, Oakland, California-based Pandora
said in the statement.  Pandora gained 53 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $13 after the
report. It added 40 cents to $12.47 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The company raised $234.9 million in
gross proceeds with its IPO, NYSE Euronext said in a statement
at the time.  This quarter, Pandora forecasts sales of $69.5 million to
$72.5 million and break-even to a loss of 2 cents a share,
excluding items. For the year, the company anticipates $270
million to $275 million in sales and a loss of 5 cents to 7
cents a share, excluding items.  For the current period, analysts project sales of $67.7
million and breakeven on a per-share basis, excluding items.  Advertising sales more than doubled last quarter to $58.3
million, while subscription and other revenue reached $8.7
million, also more than double, Pandora said. The company
generated about $600,000 in cash from operating activities,
compared with a cash burn of $3 million a year earlier.  Pandora ended the second quarter with $95.3 million in cash
and equivalents, up from $43.7 million a year ago, largely as a
result of its IPO, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
