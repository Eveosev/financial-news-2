Ukraine will harvest about 52
million metric tons of grain, of which as much as 24 million
tons can be exported, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said.  “We have a tremendous export potential,” Azarov said in a
statement on the government website posted late on Aug. 23,
before the country’s  Independence Day  yesterday. “Export
potential will be increasing.”  Ukraine will boost production of wheat, the prime minister
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
