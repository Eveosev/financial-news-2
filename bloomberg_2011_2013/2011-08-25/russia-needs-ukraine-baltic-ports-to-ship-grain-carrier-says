Russia  risks exporting less grain
this season than the 23 million metric tons it’s capable of
reaching unless shippers can use ports in Ukraine and the Baltic
States, according to ZAO Rusagrotrans.  Russia’s ports and railroad system are nearing their full
capacity to handle grain destined for foreign shipment, Igor
Pavensky, head of the market analysis department at
Rusagrotrans, said by phone from Moscow today. The company is
the country’s biggest carrier of cereals by rail.  Exports of grain and products from Russia came to 1.9
million tons in the Aug. 1-22 period, food-safety watchdog
Rosselkhoznadzor, which compiles statistics on shipments, said
in an e-mailed statement. That compares with almost 2.9 million
tons for all of July.  “Grain exports in the first 22 days of August seem to be
not a large amount,” Pavensky said. “It would be logical to
expect a significantly larger amount than in the same period of
July. It is necessary to use other port destinations.”  Traders will have to ship grain through the ports of
Odessa, Yuzhny, Ilyichevsk and Nikoalyev in Ukraine to help
attain the national export potential, according to Pavensky.
They also need to use Riga, Ventspils and Liepaja in  Latvia  and
the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda, he said.  Rail deliveries to all those ports this season may come to
between 2.5 million and 3 million tons of grain from central
Russia’s Black Earth region and the Volga region, Pavensky said.
Rusagrotrans operates 30,000 freight cars for hauling cereals,
