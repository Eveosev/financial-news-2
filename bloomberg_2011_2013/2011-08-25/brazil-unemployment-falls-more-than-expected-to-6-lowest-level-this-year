Brazil ’s unemployment rate fell to
its lowest level this year, undercutting bets that policy makers
will reduce borrowing costs. Yields on interest rate futures
jumped.  Joblessness fell to 6 percent in July from 6.2 percent the
month before, the national statistics  agency  said today in a
report distributed from Rio de Janeiro. The rate was the lowest
since December and below the 6.2 percent median of 33 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Average real wages rose 4 percent from a
year ago to 1,613 reais ($999.50) a month, the report showed.  “This wage number has left it clear that Brazil and
domestic demand are still accelerating,” said  Andre Perfeito ,
chief economist at Sao Paulo-based Gradual Investimentos. “Wage
growth is strong, putting into question the possibility of a
rate cut.”  Brazil has been adopting measures to slow the economy as
 job creation  and rising salaries add fuel to already heated
consumer demand. The central bank has raised the benchmark
interest rate five times this year, pushing it to 12.5 percent,
to slow inflation that this month exceeded 7 percent for the
first time since 2005. Policy makers target inflation of 4.5
percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Rising Yields  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 11.44 percent as of
9:20 a.m. New York time. The real was little changed at 1.6142
per  U.S. dollar , from 1.6137 yesterday.  “With this robust labor market, the central bank doesn’t
have space to cut  interest rates  in the short term,”  Luciano Rostagno , chief strategist at CM Capital Markets, said in an
interview from Sao Paulo.  Carlos Hamilton, the central bank’s director of economic
policy, said on Aug. 19 that Brazil’s jobs market is showing
signs of an “expected moderation in activity” and that credit
growth will slow to about 15 percent by the end of the year.  Brazil raised reserve and capital requirements on some
loans in December, before doubling the tax on  consumer credit  to
3 percent in April.  Latin America ’s biggest economy created the fewest number
of jobs last month since March, generating 140,563 registered
jobs in July, down from 215,393 in June, the Labor Ministry said
in a report Aug. 16. The number was lower than all 10 forecasts
in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In the same month in 2010,
Brazil added 181,796 jobs.  Debt Crises  In July, debt crises in  Europe  and the U.S. led investors
to reverse bets that the central bank would continue to raise
rates this year. Traders are now wagering that policy makers
will cut the benchmark interest rate by as much as 75 basis
points, or 0.75 percentage point, by the end of the year, and
are split on whether there will be a 25 basis-point cut next
week.  “The push for rate cuts in Brazil only makes sense if you
want to take a view that external conditions will deteriorate
much further from here,”  Gustavo Rangel , chief Brazil economist
for ING Financial Markets in  New York , said in an e-mailed
report. Recent labor and credit data show that “Brazil’s
inflation outlook may not turn rosy anytime soon,” he said.  Brazil’s economic activity shrank in June for the first
time since December, 2008. Industrial production fell 1.6
percent in June, the second-biggest drop in output since 2008,
and business confidence in the second quarter fell to its lowest
level since 2009.  Still, inflation hasn’t let up this month. The inflation
rate, as measured by the IPCA-15 index, rose to 7.1 percent in
the 12 months through mid-August from 6.75 percent the previous
month, the statistics agency said on Aug. 19  To contact the reporter on this story:
