The Slovak unit of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
increased car production 45 percent in the first six months from
a year ago, driven by rising demand for sport-utility vehicles.  Volkswagen Slovakia assembled 94,600 vehicles from January
to June, the company said in an e-mailed statement from
Bratislava, Slovakia, today. Sales jumped 33 percent to 2.4
billion euros ($3.5 billion).  The German-based carmaker assembles Touareg and Audi-brand
Q7 SUVs as well as bodies for Porsche Cayenne at its Bratislava
factory.  Production in the second half of this year will be
“positively influenced” by the start of serial assembly of the
so-called New Small Family compact cars, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
