Yields on  Mexico ’s dollar-
denominated century bonds are soaring to a record relative to
securities due in 30 years on concern the  Federal Reserve ’s
efforts to shore up the  U.S. economy  will spark inflation.  Mexico’s 100-year dollar bonds yielded 73 basis points more
than notes due in 2040 this week, the most since the country
first sold the debt in October and up from 57 on July 1. Century
bonds issued by U.S. railroad operator  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) 
yield 79 basis points more than the company’s debt due 2037, up
from 67 on July 1.  U.S. Treasuries tumbled yesterday while stocks rallied as
demand for the safest securities waned on speculation Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may introduce a third round of asset
purchases, known as quantitative easing, to buoy the U.S.
economy, which buys 80 percent of Mexico’s exports. Mexico sold
$1 billion more of the 100-year bonds on Aug. 10 as evidence the
world’s biggest economy is slowing fueled a plunge in benchmark
U.S. borrowing costs.  “The market has been anticipating some type of renewed
simulative exercise,”  Michael Roche , an emerging-market
strategist at MF Global in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “The gap will continue to widen because what’s the
goal of quantitative easing? It’s to create economic activity
and with that you’d have to think about raising the inflation
risk premium in longer-duration bonds.”  Bernanke Speech  The yield on Mexico’s 100-year bonds fell 22 basis points,
or 0.22 percentage point, in the past two months to 5.91
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on the
country’s notes due in 2040 dropped 38 basis points during the
same period to 5.21 percent. The yield differential between
securities may swell to 75 basis points, Roche said.  Bernanke is scheduled to give a speech tomorrow in  Jackson
Hole ,  Wyoming , the same place where he signaled last year a
second round of asset purchases that buoyed asset markets. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500  rose 28 percent between Aug. 26, 2010, and
Feb. 18 after he foreshadowed the $600 billion Treasury program.  The U.S. economy will expand 1.75 percent this year,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Annual inflation held at 3.6 percent in July, the
highest since October 2008.  Mexico’s central bank on Aug. 10 cut its growth forecasts
for the next two years. The country’s gross domestic product
will expand as much as 4.8 percent this year, the central bank
said on Aug. 10. It previously forecast an expansion of up to 5
percent. Annual inflation in  Latin America ’s second-biggest
economy slowed to 3.55 percent last month from 3.64 percent in
July 2010.  Limited Demand  Mexico’s 100-year bonds are also likely to underperform
because they’re more difficult for investors to buy and sell
than the country’s notes due in 2040, said  Enrique Alvarez , the
head of Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in  New
York .  “Not all the investors can buy such a long tenor and some
of them may not want to invest in such a long tenor,” Alvarez
said in a telephone interview. “Another problem is even when
it’s desirable because of the extra yield, the period in time is
so long that those extra years make it riskier. Investors that
have a Latin America mandate will prefer the 30-year over the
100-year. It’s probable that the gap may widen some more.”  Mexico has $2 billion of 100-year bonds outstanding,
compared with $4.25 billion of securities due in 2040, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Entry Point’  Donato Guarino, a strategist at Barclays Plc in New York,
said another series of Fed asset purchases may wind up luring
investors seeking higher-yielding securities to the 100-year
bonds. The gap between Mexico’s century bonds and debt due in
2040 may shrink, he said.  “It looks like an interesting entry point,” Guarino said
in an e-mail. “It’s perfect to capture further spread
compression.”  The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries was little changed at 200 basis
points as of 8:01 a.m. New York time, according to  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  indexes.  The peso rose 0.6 percent to 12.4032 per  U.S. dollar .  The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years rose three basis points yesterday to 161, according
to data provider CMA, which is owned by  CME Group Inc. (CME)  and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if
a government or company fails to adhere to its debt agreements.  U.S. Curve  Yields on interest rate futures contracts for December
delivery, known as TIIE, were unchanged at 4.73 percent
yesterday, indicating the central bank may cut the benchmark
lending rate that month.  The yield spread between Mexico’s 2040 and 2110 securities
is tracking the gap between 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasuries, MF
Global’s Roche said. The differential in Treasuries widened to a
nine-month high of 147 basis points on Aug. 12, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s a concern about future inflationary levels as a
result of continued monetary stimulation and eventual economic
activity,” Roche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
