 Steve Jobs  resigned as the chief executive officer of the U.S.
company. Hon Hai, which assembles iPhones and iPads, retreated
4.6 percent to NT$61.80, the lowest since April 13, 2009.  Foxconn Technology Group expects its relationship with the
U.S. company will grow closer under new Chief Executive Officer
 Tim Cook , the Taipei-based company said today.  “We think Tim Cook has shown good work as a stand-in CEO
during Jobs’ absences, and expect Apple will perform well in the

e-mailed response to questions.  Among other suppliers to Apple, TPK Holding Co. (3673 TT)

may benefit HTC and Samsung Electronics Co., the Asian
smartphone makers that are locked in a protracted patent battle
with the iPhone maker, analysts said.  Acer Inc. (2353)  (2353 TT), the world’s fourth-largest computer
maker, fell by its 7 percent daily limit to NT$ 29.35. The
