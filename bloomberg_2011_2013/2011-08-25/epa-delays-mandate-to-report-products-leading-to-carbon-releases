The Environmental Protection Agency
said it would put off reporting requirements for manufacturers
and power plants on the products they use that lead to
greenhouse-gas emissions.  In a Federal Register notice today, the EPA said that
companies would have until at least 2013 to submit information
about the raw materials. Representatives of chemical makers, oil
refiners and other manufacturers have tried to scuttle the EPA’s
proposal, saying it would force them to disclose confidential
information.  The rules were set to take effect this year. The EPA
proposed in December that they be deferred and today’s notice
makes that decision final. The rules will be delayed until March
31, 2013, for some substances and two years later for others.  Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more a year of
 greenhouse gases , such as carbon dioxide, are required to submit
annual reports to the EPA on those releases. On Aug. 22, the EPA
started a new program that lets 7,000 power plants, refiners and
other manufacturers file their emissions data electronically.
The information must be submitted by the end of September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
