European Multilateral Clearing
Facility NV said it plans start clearing over-the-counter trades
and will expand its services into structured products.  EMCF will provide clearing and settlement services to
 Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s CATS trading system for bilateral transactions,
the company said in e-mailed statement today. Amsterdam-based
EMCF is owned by ABN Amro Group NV and  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)   Some clearinghouses act as central counterparty to every
buy and sell order executed on an exchange, reducing the risk
that a trader defaults on his obligation in a deal. Customers
pay fees for clearing, or post-trade processing services, which
include verifying that a buyer has the funds to execute a trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
