French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said he hopes that  China ’s yuan can “eventually” be integrated
into the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights
system.  Speaking to reporters in Beijing after meeting with Chinese
President Hu Jintao, Sarkozy said “we hope to progress on the
definition of a path that would eventually allow, after an
appropriate and not-hurried process, the integration of the yuan
in the SDR, which would allow the creation of a global reserve
currency and would give the yuan its deserved international
status.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
