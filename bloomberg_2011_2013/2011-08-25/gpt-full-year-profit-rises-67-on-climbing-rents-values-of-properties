GPT Group (GPT) ,  Australia ’s third-biggest
property trust by market capitalization, reported a 67 percent
jump in first-half profit after rents and the values of its
properties rose.  Net profit for the six months to June 30 was A$243.1
million ($253.6 million), compared with A$145.2 million a year
earlier, according to a statement from the Sydney-based company
today. Operating profit rose 8 percent to A$221.5 million, the
company said.  “We are undertaking a range of opportunities to add value
to our business,” including A$1.8 billion worth of development
projects, Managing Director Michael Cameron said in the
statement. “We are excited about the future performance of the
business as we now have strong building blocks in place for
growth in 2011 and beyond.”  GPT, which has sold off some properties, is using the
proceeds to buy back up to 5 percent of its outstanding shares
in a bid to narrow the gap between its trading price and the
value of its assets. The company is focusing on expanding its
business at home through rent increases, growth in funds
management, developments and acquisitions, Cameron told
shareholders in May.  GPT will pay a dividend of 8.5 Australian cents for the
half year and expects full-year operating profit to climb about
7 percent in 2011 from a year ago, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
