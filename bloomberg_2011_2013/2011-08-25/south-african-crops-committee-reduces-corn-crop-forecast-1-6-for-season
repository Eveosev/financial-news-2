South Africa ’s Crop Estimates
Committee cut its forecast for this season’s corn crop by 1.6
percent to 10.68 million metric tons from the last estimate,
said Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee.  The committee cut its white-corn crop estimate by 1.6
percent to 6.2 million tons and reduced its forecast for yellow
corn by the same amount to 4.48 million tons, Scheepers said by
phone from  Pretoria  today.  The forecast for the total corn crop is higher than the
median estimate of 10.4 million tons of 12 traders surveyed by
Bloomberg on Aug. 22.  The committee raised the forecast for the sunflower seed
crop by 4.8 percent to 861,770 tons while slashing the groundnut
forecast by 12 percent to 69,420 tons.  The sorghum crop estimate was cut 7.8 percent to 159,700
tons and the dry bean forecast reduced 2.8 percent to 44,000
tons. The soybean forecast was left unchanged at 708,750 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
