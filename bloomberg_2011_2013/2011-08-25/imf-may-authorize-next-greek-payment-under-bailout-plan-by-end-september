The  International Monetary Fund  may
authorize the next disbursement for Greece under a joint bailout
with Europe at the end of next month, a spokesman for the fund
said.  A review of policies attached to the current
110 billion-euro ($159 billion) bailout with the European Union
is currently taking place in Athens and should conclude around
Sept. 5, spokesman  David Hawley  told reporters in Washington
today.  “Assuming agreements are in place, the IMF executive board
could be in position to consider approval of the next
disbursement towards the end” of September, Hawley said.  The Greek government has not made any request for another
loan and current talks to get the private sector involved in
helping reduce the Greek debt load are not part of the current
review, he said.  Hawley said the IMF is monitoring the conflict in  Libya  and
“ will await an expression of the wishes from an
internationally recognized government,” on potential financial
aid.  Separately, Hawley said that former chief  Dominique
Strauss-Kahn  may come to the IMF for a “personal visit” as
early as next week. Sexual-assault charges against
Strauss-Kahn, who resigned to defend himself in May, were
dropped this week.  “Like any former managing director of the IMF, Mr. Strauss-
Kahn would be welcome to visit the fund,” Hawley said. “I
understand that he intends to make a personal visit” to meet
with the staff.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
