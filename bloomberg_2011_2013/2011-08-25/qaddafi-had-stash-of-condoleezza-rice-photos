When rebels stormed  Muammar
Qaddafi ’s fortified compound this week, they found the Libyan
dictator’s photo album of former Secretary of State  Condoleezza Rice , whom he once described as a “darling black African
woman.”  State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland today
described the discovery as “deeply bizarre and deeply creepy.”  In September 2008, when Qaddafi was seeking to improve
relations with the U.S., he and Rice had an Iftar meal to mark
the end of the daily fast during the holy month of Ramadan.
Rice’s eight-hour stop in Tripoli made her the highest-level
U.S. official to visit Libya in more than 50 years.  For the occasion, Qaddafi donned a white robe with a green
and yellow sash patterned in outlines of the African continent.
Rice was dressed in a sober pin-striped grey suit.  After their meeting, Rice told reporters that the
relationship with  Libya  was “off to a good start” and “Libya
has changed. America has changed.”  In greeting Rice, Qaddafi at the time put his hand to his
heart asked her how she was. “I’m very well, thank you,” she
answered. Undeterred by the language barrier, Qaddafi spoke to
her in Arabic through an interpreter.  Qaddafi had been an ardent fan of Rice even before their
face-to-face encounter. In a  2007 interview  with al Jazeera he
described her as his “darling black African woman.” He
referred to her as Leezza and said “I love her very much.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
