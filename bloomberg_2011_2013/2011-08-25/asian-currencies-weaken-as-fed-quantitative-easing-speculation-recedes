Asian currencies fell, led by  South
Korea ’s won, as data pointed to slowing growth in the region and
speculation receded that the  Federal Reserve  will inject more
dollars into the financial system.  Reports today showed South Korean  consumer confidence 
dropped to the lowest since March and Philippine imports
declined 7.9 percent from a month earlier in June. Better-than
expected durable-goods orders and home-price data from the U.S.
curbed speculation Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will announce a
third round of bond purchases that boost the supply of dollars,
known as quantitative easing, when he speaks tomorrow at a
symposium at  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  “Expectations for QE3 have been pared down because the
recent economic data isn’t conclusive” enough to warrant urgent
action, said Sim Moh Siong, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Bank of Singapore Ltd. The dollar’s strength “is consistent”
with those expectations, he said.  The won weakened 0.5 percent to 1,087.66 per dollar as of
the 3 p.m. close in Seoul. Malaysia’s ringgit fell 0.4 percent
to 2.9868,  Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped 0.3 percent to 8,584 and
the  Singapore dollar  declined 0.2 percent to S$1.2078.  Global funds sold $3.7 billion more South Korean, Thai and
Indonesian stocks than they bought in the first three days of
this week, according to exchange data.  U.S. house prices rose 0.9 percent in June from the month
before, the biggest increase since September 2005, a report
showed yesterday. Durable-goods orders jumped 4 percent in July
from a year earlier, following a revised 1.3 percent contraction
the previous month.  Korean’s Pessimistic  UBS AG downgraded its growth and currency forecasts for
several Southeast Asian economies, citing the deteriorating
global outlook, in a research note released today. It cut its
2011 growth estimate for Thailand to 3.5 percent, from 4.5
percent, and that for  Singapore  to 4.5 percent from 5.5 percent.
The bank lowered its year-end projection for the Thai baht to 31
per dollar from 30, and that for the ringgit to 3.10 from 3.  The won weakened for a second day after the Bank of Korea
said today its sentiment index fell to 99 in August from 102 in
July. A reading below 100 indicates people are more pessimistic
than the average between the first quarter of 1999 and the
second quarter of 2008.  “There’s skepticism in the market whether there’s an
effective stimulus measure that Bernanke can announce at the
meeting,” said Ryoo Hyun Jung, chief currency dealer at
Citibank Inc. in  Seoul . “This uncertainty is preventing players
from taking a strong one-sided position.”  Philippine Imports  The peso dropped for a second day as the slump in imports
fanned concern the nation’s economic outlook is deteriorating.
Annual growth rates for imports in May and June were the lowest
in a year.  “Imports have been in a decelerating mode,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore. “There’s not
much optimism among local manufacturers to step up purchases
when you don’t see sustainable end demand. Capital imports have
been quite under the weather.”  Elsewhere, the baht and India’s rupee dropped 0.2 percent
to 29.98 and 46.0638, respectively. The  Taiwan dollar  and the
Philippine peso weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.041 and 42.515,
respectively, and  China ’s yuan slipped 0.02 percent to 6.39.  To contact the reporter on this story:
