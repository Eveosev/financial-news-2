China ’s yuan forwards dropped by the
most in a week as better-than-forecast U.S. economic data
boosted demand for the greenback.  The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against
the currencies of six trading partners, advanced 0.16 percent
yesterday after reports showed durable-goods orders rose 4
percent in July and home prices gained the most since September
2005. Wang Yong, a professor at the central bank’s training
center in Zhengzhou, wrote in the Shanghai Securities News that
China shouldn’t use yuan gains to curb inflation. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will deliver a speech tomorrow
at  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  “The yuan today is in line with other Asian currencies,”
said  Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp. in Sydney. “We don’t think Bernanke will deliver
a speech that will spark a wave of broader dollar declines.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slid 0.11 percent to
6.2921 per dollar as of 4:47 p.m. in  Hong Kong , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s a 1.6 percent premium to the
onshore spot rate.  The yuan declined 0.02 percent to close at 6.3900 per
dollar in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency may rise to 6.3 per dollar over the
next year, Callow forecast. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the
yuan fell 0.08 percent to 6.3739.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  0.06
percent weaker at 6.3936 per dollar, having strengthened the
fixing on each of the last three trading days. The currency is
allowed to trade by up to 0.5 percent against the dollar either
side of the so-called central-parity rate.  --Judy Chen, Fion Li. Editors: Andrew Janes, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
