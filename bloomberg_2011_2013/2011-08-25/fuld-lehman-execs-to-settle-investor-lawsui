Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) 
executives including former Chairman Richard Fuld will settle an
investor lawsuit using a $90 million payment from the defunct
firm’s insurers, according to a court filing.  The investors blamed Lehman officers and directors for
losses on Lehman stock and options from June 12, 2007, to Sept.
15, 2008, according to the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
 Manhattan . Fuld, 65, was chief executive officer of New York-
based Lehman, once the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank,
before its 2008 bankruptcy.  A bankruptcy examiner said Lehman foundered because of too
much debt, which it tried to hide from investors, and risky real
estate investments.  Patricia Hynes, a lawyer for Fuld, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Lehman said in November that Fuld would get $10 million
from insurers as part of an officers-and-directors program
paying for the costs of lawsuits. It also said insurers would be
asked to pay as much as $90 million in costs for unidentified
defendants in civil, criminal and regulatory proceedings.  Lehman has asked the judge to modify bankruptcy law on nine
previous occasions to tap its directors-and-officers insurance,
according to yesterday’s filing.  The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
