The dollar weakened against most of
its major counterparts as investors mulled whether Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will announce further monetary
stimulus for the economy tomorrow.  South Africa’s rand and Norway’s krone were the best
performers against the dollar and yen as stock-market gains in
Asia and Europe spurred demand for higher-yielding assets. The
dollar pared losses against the euro as claims for  unemployment
benefits  in the U.S. unexpectedly rose last week.  “The market is treating Bernanke’s speech tomorrow almost
like a policy meeting,” said  Steve Barrow , the London-based
head of Group-of-10 currency research at Standard Bank Plc,
wrote in a client note today. “If he signals QE3, it could
support higher-yielding assets like stocks, the Scandinavian
currencies and the Aussie and kiwi dollars at the expense of the
 U.S. dollar . If the market is disappointed, then it could see a
return to risk-off.”  The dollar declined less than 0.1 percent to $1.4421 per
euro as of 8:40 a.m. in New York, after dropping as much as 0.4
percent to $1.4475. The yen declined for a fifth day against the
euro, losing 0.3 percent to 111.26, and was 0.2 percent weaker
at 77.16 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
