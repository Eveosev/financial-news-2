Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures dropped in  New York , following equities,
after panic selling pushed  Germany â€™s DAX Index lower and U.S.
unemployment benefit claims unexpectedly rose.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 44.4 percent at noon in New York,
up from 42.6 percent yesterday. Options volatility was 37.5
percent a week ago.  Oil for October delivery fell 27 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$84.89 a barrel at 12:48 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have fallen 7.1 percent this year.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
October $75 puts, with 2,350 lots changing hands. The options
gained 9 cents to $1.18 a barrel. October $70 puts, the next-
most active option, advanced 6 cents to 62 cents with 1,985 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The four most-active options today were October puts, with
strike prices ranging from $65 to $80 a barrel. Puts accounted
for 62 percent of the volume in electronic trading on the Nymex.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  December $50 puts were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 13,222 lots changing hands. They rose
4 cents to 28 cents a barrel. The next-most active options,
October $80 puts, gained 5 cents to $2.02 a barrel on volume of
5,122.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
47,800 contracts. Next were December $85 puts with 43,817 and
