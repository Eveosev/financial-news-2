DP World Ltd. (DPW) , Dubai’s government-
controlled port operator, posted a better-than-expected jump in
first-half profit as volume increased and the company booked a
gain from selling its Australian unit.  Net income quadrupled to $705.3 million from $176.6 million
a year earlier, the company said today in a  statement . Earnings
beat the $360 million median estimate of four analysts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding a $436
million gain from the Australian disposal and including minority
interests, profit rose 36 percent to $281 million.  DP World sold 75 percent of its Australia operations for
$1.5 billion to Citi Infrastructure Investors and a partner on
Dec. 22. Cargo volume increases were driven by trade in the
Asia-Pacific region,  Africa  and the Americas, helped by new
sites in Chile and  China , while spending cuts held back growth
in costs, the company said today.  Earnings are “close to profit levels seen at our peak in
2008, as our container terminals have became more profitable
following initiatives implemented as a result of the 2009
downturn,” Chief Executive Officer Mohammed Sharaf said in the
statement. “There is uncertainty around the outlook for the
global economy, making it more challenging to forecast how
global trade will develop in the second half of the year.”  The port operator is majority owned by state-owned holding
company Dubai World. First-half revenue fell 1.5 percent to $1.5
billion. Gross cash generation increased 9 percent to $570
million and net debt totaled $3.7 billion at the end of June, DP
World said. Gross cargo volume rose 11 percent to 26.2 million
containers.  The company is “well positioned” with $4.1 billion in
cash to pay debt maturing toward the end of October 2012, it
said.  DP World was unchanged at $10.75 as of 12:45 p.m. in Dubai
trading after rising as much as 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
