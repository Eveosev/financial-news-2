Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, fell 3.4 percent in
the first half of August, industry association Unica said.  Output dropped to 2.65 million metric tons in the two-week
period, down from 2.75 million tons a year earlier,  Unica  said
today in an e-mailed statement. Ethanol production declined 16
percent to 1.61 billion liters (426 million gallons) from 1.93
billion liters.  Farmers in the Center South, where about 90 percent of
Brazil’s sugar and ethanol is produced, harvested 38.5 million
tons of cane in the period, down 4.2 percent from the same
period last year, the association said. The harvest usually runs
from March through November.  Brazil is the world’s largest sugar producer.  Latin
America ’s biggest economy accounts for more than half the
world’s exports, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  Farmers have reaped 297.6 million tons of cane in the
harvest so far, a drop of 12 percent from the same period a year
earlier. Mills in the region have produced 17.4 million tons of
sugar this year, down 11 percent from last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
