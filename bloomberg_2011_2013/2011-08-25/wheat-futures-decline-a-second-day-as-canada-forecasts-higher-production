Wheat fell the most in a week in
 Chicago  after Canada, the world’s fourth-biggest exporter of the
grain, predicted a 3.9 percent gain in production this year.
Corn and soybeans dropped for a second day.  Canada’s wheat harvest will increase to 24.1 million metric
tons,  Statistics Canada  said yesterday. That’s up from an Aug.
11 U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of 21.5 million tons.
The Canadian crop should make up for lost spring-wheat output in
the U.S., which may fall 17 percent, said  Dave Norris , a grain
broker in Harrogate,  England .  “StatsCanada reckons that increased wheat production there
alone, compared with the latest USDA figures, will make up for
America’s spring-wheat shortfall,” Norris said today in a
report.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $7.7225 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices slid as much as 2 percent, the
most since Aug. 18, after surging 6.1 percent in three sessions
through Aug. 23 on concern hot weather in the U.S. may curb the
harvest in the world’s largest exporter.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris was little changed at 207 euros ($299) a ton.  Corn for December delivery dropped 4 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $7.39 a bushel in Chicago. Soybeans for November delivery
lost 4.5 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $13.89 a bushel.  Russia’s grain crop will come to 87 million to 88 million
tons, researcher SovEcon, which previously predicted a harvest
of 87 million to 90 million tons, said today. The country’s
grain exports from July 1 to Aug. 22 totaled 4.8 million tons,
food-safety watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor said in an e-mailed
statement.  Germany ’s grain harvest will fall 12 percent to 39 million
tons on “terrible” weather, the DBV German Farmers Association
said at a press conference today. The wheat crop will drop 12
percent to 21 million tons, it predicted. The country is the
second-biggest European Union wheat producer after France.  To contact the reporters on this story:
