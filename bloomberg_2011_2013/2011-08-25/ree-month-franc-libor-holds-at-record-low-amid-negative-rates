The Libor rate that London-based
banks say they can borrow at in Swiss francs for three months
remained at a record low 0.00667 percent, the British Bankers’
Association said today.  Credit Suisse AG submitted a negative three-month Libor for
a sixth day, at minus 0.10 percent from negative 0.15 percent
yesterday, BBA data show. Citigroup Inc. submitted a rate below
zero for the fourth day, unchanged at negative 0.05 percent.  Societe Generale SA, the third lender to submit a negative
rate, offered to borrow at minus 0.05 percent today, compared
with negative 0.03 percent yesterday.  The  Swiss National Bank  lowered its target for three-month
franc Libor to “as close to zero as possible” on Aug. 3 as it
attempts to restrain the currency’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
