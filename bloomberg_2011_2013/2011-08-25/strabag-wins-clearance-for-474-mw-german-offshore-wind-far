Strabag SE (STR) , an Austrian construction
company, and German renewable energy developer Northern Energy
Group won clearance from federal shipping authorities to build a
79-turbine wind farm off  Germany â€™s North Sea coast.  The farm, which still needs to secure financing, would have
a total capacity of 474 megawatts should 6-megawatt turbines be
used, Torsten Ebbecke, a spokesman for project developer
Northern Energy OWP Albatros GmbH, said in a phone interview.
Construction will start in 2013 or 2014, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
