Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker, fell for the first day in four after  Delta
Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  deferred an order of 100 small narrow-body jets
until 2012.  Shares dropped 2.8 percent to 9.14 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most in a
week.  Delta delayed talks with Embraer and rival  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) 
as it prepares to buy 100 Boeing Co. 737s, a person familiar
with the matter said.  “It’s a negative sign for the company,” Rodolfo Amstalden, an analyst at Empiricus Research, a Sao Paulo-based
equity consulting firm, said in a telephone interview. “Not
because of the deal itself, but because its delay signals that,
amid a global economic slowdown, demand for the company’s
aircrafts isn’t as strong as expected.”  Embraer and Bombardier are trying to create a niche for
jets smaller than those from Airbus and Boeing. Single-aisle
planes from Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil-based Embraer or
Bombardier would complement Delta’s mainline fleet of Boeing and
Airbus narrow-bodies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
