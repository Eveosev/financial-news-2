Uganda’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency this year, may extend its decline to
the weakest in 18 years against the dollar by the end of
September as banks buy the U.S. currency, according to Bank of
Africa Uganda Ltd.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy may
trade from 2,780 to 2,880 per dollar at the end of next month,
as much as 2.4 percent weaker than current levels, Ahmed Kalule,
the head of  currency trading  at the bank, said by phone from the
capital, Kampala. It reached 2,818.5 per dollar on Aug. 24, the
weakest intraday level since June 1993.  “Rising demand for the dollar against low inflows” will
push the currency weaker, Kalule said. “Banks are preparing to
buy the dollar to cater for their customers’ demands for
operations towards the end of the year.”  Uganda’s currency appreciated for the first time in four
days, climbing as much as 0.7 percent to 2,795 before trading
0.1 percent up at 2,812 by 1:16 p.m. in Kampala, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The shilling has slumped 11 percent in the last two months
and 18 percent this year against the dollar, making it the
world’s worst-performing currency in both periods. A surge in
food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more than 18-year
high of 18.7 percent in July from 15.7 percent in June.  Uganda  is on the cusp of an oil boom with Tullow Oil Plc, a
U.K.-based energy company, expected to start pumping crude and
gas from the Lake Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an
estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion
barrels in proven reserves, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
