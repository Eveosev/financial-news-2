Two of the four Italian journalists
kidnapped yesterday by a group loyal to the regime of  Muammar
Qaddafi  in  Libya  called their relatives in a sign that they may
be freed soon, the editor in chief of  Corriere della Sera  said.  They “have called home, a positive sign,” Ferruccio de
Bortoli said in a Twitter posting. “The hope that they can be
freed is gaining strength,” he added.  The four journalists who work for Corriere della Sera, La
Stampa and Avvenire dailies, were taken as they drove from
Zawiyah to Tripoli, news agency Ansa reported yesterday, citing
Bruno Tucci, president of the Lazio Press Club.  The kidnappers killed the driver of the car in which the
journalists were traveling, Ansa said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
