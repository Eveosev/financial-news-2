Germany ’s airline industry wants the
country’s new tax on flight tickets to be abandoned because it
is hurting the country’s airlines and smaller airports,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported today.  The aviation tax has led to “a massive competition
distortion in the international market,” German air traffic
association BDL said, according to the newspaper. The German
airport association said the aviation tax “must be abolished
immediately” because it is hurting middle-sized airports such
as Cologne and Bremen, it told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
