Kenya ’s three-month borrowing costs
rose to an almost 9 1/2-year high after the central bank raised
the rate of obtaining funds from its overnight window.  The yield on the 91-day bills increased to 9.708 percent
from 9.258 percent at the previous sale, the highest since April
2002, the Nairobi-based Central Bank of Kenya said in an e-
mailed statement today. The bank, which had offered 2 billion
shillings ($22 million) of the notes, received 3.1 billion
shillings of bids, accepting all of them, it said.  The advance in yields “has been influenced by the
overnight rates shooting up over 20 percent,” Karanja Ndung’u,
a fixed-income trader with Nairobi-based Tsavo Securities Ltd.,
said by phone today.  The central bank began applying a penalty for lending from
its overnight discount window on Aug. 15 to curb the use of
funds for speculation, causing the rate to surge to 17.98
percent on Aug. 18, compared with 6.25 percent before the new
rules came into force. The central bank stopped publishing the
figure on Aug. 19 and said it would only reveal the data to
borrowers when they are seeking funds.  Interbank rates in Kenya soared to 24.25 percent as of
yesterday, compared with 8.34 percent when the central bank’s
new overnight lending rules were announced on Aug. 12.  The central bank will offer 2 billion shillings in 91-day
Treasury bills next week, the central bank statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
