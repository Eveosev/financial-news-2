Yields on long-term Brazilian rate
futures contracts declined after claims for U.S. unemployment
benefits unexpectedly rose, adding to speculation that a global
slowdown will crimp inflation in the South American country.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2017 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.67 percent.  The yields on longer-term contracts, known as DIs, are
dropping after the Commerce Department reported that U.S.
jobless claims rose by 5,000 to 417,000 in the week ended Aug.
20, said Mauricio Junqueira, who helps manage about $300 million
at Squanto Investimentos. Economists had projected a drop in
claims to 405,000, according to the median of estimates in a
Bloomberg forecast.  “The long-term DIs are following the foreign market,”
Junqueira said in a telephone interview. Policy makers could cut
 Brazil ’s benchmark overnight rate as early as October “if the
worst case scenario” happens for global growth, he said.  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in January
2012 held at 12.09 percent, indicating traders are betting
policy makers will lower borrowing costs by at least 50 basis
points this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The real rose 0.3 percent to 1.6094 per  U.S. dollar , from
1.6137 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
