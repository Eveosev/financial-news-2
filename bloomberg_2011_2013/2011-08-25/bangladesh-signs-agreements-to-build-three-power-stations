Bangladesh’s Power Development Board
signed agreements with two groups of companies to build three
power stations with a combined capacity of 302 megawatts, the
agency said in a statement today.  Malaysia’s Mutiara Consolidated Sdn Bhd and Bangladesh’s
Power Pac Holdings will set up a 99.4 megawatt furnace oil-based
power station in the southwestern city of Khulna and another
94.8 megawatt plant in the northeastern town of Jamalpur,
according to the statement. A venture between London-based
 Rurelec Plc (RUR)  and Dhaka-based  Confidence Cement Ltd. (CONFID)  and Energy
Pac Generation Ltd. will build a 108 megawatt plant at
Chittagong.  The Power Development Board will buy electricity from the
Khulna plant at an average price of 6.69 taka per kilowatt hour,
according to the statement. Power from the Jamalpur station will
be purchased at 6.98 taka a unit and from the Chittagong plant
at 7.02 taka a unit.  The three stations will be completed by November 2012,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
