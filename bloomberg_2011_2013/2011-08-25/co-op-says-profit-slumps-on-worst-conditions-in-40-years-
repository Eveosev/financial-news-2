Co-operative Group Ltd., the U.K.’s
largest mutual retailer, said full-year profit will not reach
2010 levels as the economic slowdown bit “deeper than anyone
had expected.”  Trading conditions are “the worst I have seen in over 40
years of retailing,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Marks said
today in a statement. “Looking ahead, we do not see signs of
any real improvement in the economy.”  Co-op is mutually owned by almost six million consumers and
is Britain’s fifth-biggest food retailer, according to its
website. The company also provides financial services through
its banking and insurance units.  “I said six months ago that I felt we’d be bumping along
the bottom for some time,” Marks said today on a conference
call. “I really don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel.
The consumer is squeezed like never before.”  Underlying operating profit for the 26 weeks to July 2
dropped 11 percent to 275.1 million pounds ($450.7 million) the
Manchester, England-based company said in the statement. Revenue
slipped to 6.89 billion pounds from 6.95 billion pounds a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
