German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
canceled a trip to a conference in Russia next month to focus on
the European debt crisis,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported,
citing her chief spokesman.  Merkel will stay in Berlin, where she will probably speak
during a parliamentary budget debate on Sept. 7 and the
government will introduce legislation to ratify expanded powers
for the rescue fund for indebted euro countries on Sept. 8, the
German news agency quoted spokesman Steffen Seibert as saying.  Merkel had planned to give a speech at the Sept. 7-8
conference on governments and social diversity in Yaroslavl,
Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
