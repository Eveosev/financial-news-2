The rate that London-based banks say
they can borrow at for three months in dollars rose to the
highest in a year after climbing for a 23rd straight day.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans increased to 0.31900 percent from 0.31428 percent
yesterday, according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest since Aug. 20, 2010, and the longest stretch of
gains since November 2005.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, widened to 23.50 basis points as of 12:20 p.m. in
London, from 22.73 basis points yesterday. That’s the most since
Aug. 6, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
