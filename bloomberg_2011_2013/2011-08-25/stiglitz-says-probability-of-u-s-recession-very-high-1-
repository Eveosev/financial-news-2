Nobel-prize winning economist  Joseph Stiglitz  said the chances of the  U.S. economy  going back into
recession are “very high.”  “The unemployment situation in the U.S. is very severe and
very probably going to get worse,” Stiglitz told reporters
today at a conference in Lindau, Germany. “There’s a very high
probability we’ll go into double dip.”  Claims for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose
5,000 to 417,000 in the week ended Aug. 20, Labor Department
figures showed today. The U.S. unemployment rate is 9.1 percent.  Stiglitz said calls by policy makers to engage in deficit-
cutting austerity measures were heading in “exactly the wrong
direction.”  “The most important way to address the deficit is to get
America back to work, to get the economy back to full
employment,” Stiglitz said at an annual gathering of Nobel
Prize-winning economists. “Austerity is going to get us
predictably into trouble. Spend the money on investments, and
those investments will lead to higher growth.”  Stiglitz, a professor of economics at  Columbia University ,
also argued that countries in the euro area including Germany
should reverse their budget-cutting drives or risk falling back
into recession.  “If Germany and other countries which have the capacity to
engage in expansionary activity would do it, that would help
those parts of  Europe  where they face constraints,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
