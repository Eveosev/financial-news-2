Oil advanced on speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  may announce new measures to stimulate the
economy, and after U.S. crude inventories declined.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may outline steps
to bolster the world’s largest economy during a speech tomorrow.
Crude inventories fell for a second week last week, slipping by
about 2 million barrels, U.S. government data showed yesterday.
Standard Chartered Plc reduced its oil-price forecasts before a
report that may show U.S. growth slowed in the second quarter.  “Everyone’s sitting back and waiting to see what Bernanke
has to say,” said  Jonathan Barratt , a managing director of
Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney who predicts crude will
average $100 a barrel this year.  Crude for October delivery was at $85.74 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , up 0.7
percent at 8:43 a.m. London time. Yesterday, the contract lost
28 cents to $85.16, the lowest close since Aug. 22. Prices have
gained 17 percent from a year ago.  Brent oil for October settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange traded at $111.12 a barrel, up 97 cents.
The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $25.38 to
U.S. futures, down from a record $26.21 on Aug. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
