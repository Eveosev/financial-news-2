Russia  exported 4.8 million metric
tons of grain and products in the July 1 to Aug. 22 period,
national  food safety watchdog  Rosselkhoznadzor wrote in an e-
mailed statement.  For the period from Aug. 1 to Aug. 22 exports were 1.9
million tons, according to the statement.  Egypt  was the biggest importer in the July 1 to Aug. 22
period, taking 878,718 tons, including 854,568 tons of wheat,
the watchdog said. Turkey was the second-largest importer with
725,810 tons of wheat and 68,287 tons of other grains.  Italy bought 306,619 tons of wheat, Kenya 286,284 tons,
Israel 242,462 tons, Spain 215,735 tons and Yemen 229,448 tons,
according to the report.  Saudi Arabia  imported 317,491 tons of
barley.  Rosselkhoznadzor did not provide comparable numbers for
last year. Russia, once the worldâ€™s second-biggest wheat
exporter, banned all major grain exports from Aug. 15, 2010 to
July 1, 2011 after extreme heat and drought damaged crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
