Eni SpA (ENI)  Chief Executive Officer
Paolo Scaroni said the company’s priority in Libya is increasing
natural gas production as it will take between six and 18 months
to restart oil output.  Scaroni wants to boost gas production before the winter
hits in Italy, a country that gets much of its natural gas
supply from Libya.  “Before I go to bed at night, the last thing that I think
about are Italian gas supplies for winter,” Scaroni said after
meeting Libyan Transitional Council Prime Minister Mahmoud
Jibril in Milan.  Eni will begin supplying the council with gasoline and
diesel fuel in the coming days that would eventually be paid for
with crude oil, Scaroni said.  Eni, the biggest foreign investor in  Libya , saw most of its
prodcution  halted by the six-month conflict to oust Muammar Qaddafi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
