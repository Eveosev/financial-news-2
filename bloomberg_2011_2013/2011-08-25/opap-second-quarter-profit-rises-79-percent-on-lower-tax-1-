Opap SA (OPAP) , Europe’s biggest listed
gambling company, said second-quarter profit advanced 79 percent
after an extraordinary levy last year wasn’t repeated.  Net income rose to 106.9 million euros ($153.4 million)
from 59.7 million euros for the three month period through June
30, according to an Athens bourse filing today. That missed a
124.1 million-euro average of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Earnings a year earlier were hit by a 93.8 million-
euro levy on Greek companies as the government pushed to narrow
the  budget deficit .  Legislation to regulate the Greek gambling market
“provides us with a much needed visibility for the gaming
business environment over the coming years,” Chief Executive
Officer Ioannis Spanoudakis said in the filing. Opap is granted
a total of 35,000 video-lottery terminal licenses, of which
18,500 have to be subcontracted, under the new law. The bill
went into effect Aug. 22.  Revenue dropped 22 percent to 1.07 billion euros, matching
analysts’ estimates. Sales of fixed-odds sports betting game
Pame Stihima fell 36 percent to 362.5 million euros. In the same
quarter last year the game was boosted by betting at the soccer
 World Cup  in  South Africa . Kino, the company’s biggest numbers
game, dropped 16 percent to 545.3 million euros.  Opap has a monopoly on Greek sports betting until 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
