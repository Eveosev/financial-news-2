Li Ning  Co.,  China ’s largest maker
and retailer of sportswear, fell in  Hong Kong  trading after
saying first-half profit dropped by almost half and that it
expects margins to narrow further.  Li Ning dropped 2.4 percent to HK$8.78 at 10:05 a.m. in
Hong Kong, extending its slump this year to 47 percent, compared
with a 14 percent decline in the  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   The clothier founded by former Olympic gymnast Li Ning
yesterday said first-half net income plummeted 49 percent from a
year earlier to 294 million yuan ($46 million) as costs and
competition increased.  Higher prices for materials, labor and rents, as well as
higher discounts for distributors, cut Li Ning’s profit margin
to 6.8 percent in the six months ending June 30 from 12.9
percent a year earlier, it said in a filing to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange.  The gross margin for the second half of this year will be
lower than in the same period in 2010 and the margin on profit
attributable to equity holders for the full year of 2011 is
expected to narrow by about 1 to 2 percentage points, the
company said.  China Dongxiang Group, Li Ning’s smaller domestic rival,
yesterday said net income plummeted 71 percent to 225 million
yuan in the first half.  Xtep International Holdings (1368)  Ltd., a
Chinese sportswear maker part-owned by the  Carlyle Group , last
week said its first-half net income grew 25 percent to 466
million yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
