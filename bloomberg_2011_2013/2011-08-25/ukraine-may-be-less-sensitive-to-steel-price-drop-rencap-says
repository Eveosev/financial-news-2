Ukraine may not suffer to the extent
it did when metals prices plunged during the global financial
crisis three years ago, investment bank  Renaissance Capital 
said.  “Assuming a worst-case scenario of declining commodity
prices, which are crucial for Ukraine, the country may be less
sensitive to global cooling than in 2008-2009,” analysts
Anastasia Golovach in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, and  Ivan Tchakarov  in Moscow wrote in a report today. “Despite the panic
in the global financial markets, steel,  iron ore  and cooking
coal prices have remained relatively stable.”  Metals and mining helped drive Ukraine’s economy before the
crisis, according to Renaissance. Recovery in the former Soviet
republic is largely the result of increased real wages and a
higher propensity to consume, it said.  “We think salaries will continue to grow, particularly as
the country is expecting parliamentary elections in October
2012,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
