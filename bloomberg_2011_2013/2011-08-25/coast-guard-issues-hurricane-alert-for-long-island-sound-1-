The U.S. Coast Guard has issued a
hurricane alert for Long Island Sound as Hurricane Irene
approaches, according to Jeff Hall, a Boston-based spokesman for
the Coast Guard. The alert was issued because gale-force winds
of at least 39 miles (63 kilometers) per hour may threaten the
sound within 72 hours, Hall said.  No alert has been issued for the Port of  New York , Hall
said.  The Coast Guard sets port conditions based on when winds of
39 mph or more associated with a hurricane may arrive. Ports
remain open to all commercial traffic when such winds are
expected within 72 or 48 hours.  Vessel restrictions are imposed with gale-force winds may
affect a port within 24 hours. The port is closed when such
winds are due to arrive within 12 hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
