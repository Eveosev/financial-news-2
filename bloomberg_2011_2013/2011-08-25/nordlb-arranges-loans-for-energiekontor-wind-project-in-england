Norddeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, the German bank that’s financed renewable-energy
projects for more than 15 years, arranged 39.6 million pounds
($64.9 million) in loans for a wind farm in northern  England .  NordLB structured and arranged the non-recourse project
debt finance with a 15-year term for 12 turbines in Lancashire
owned by  Energiekontor AG , the bank said late yesterday in an e-
mailed statement.  The sum includes a 10 million-euro ($14.5 million) term
loan from KfW Bankengruppe, the German  development bank  with a
lending program for clean energy, with a rate about 0.75 percent
below the commercial funding level, according to the statement.  The financing plan also includes a 27 million-pound
commercial loan and 4 million pounds of “facilities” to cover
tax and a decommissioning bond for the 24.6-megawatt farm, the
bank said. The project will be commissioned in September 2012.  KfW and Hanover-based NordLB, which has been involved in
financing 5,000 megawatts of renewables projects, are lending to
developers such as Bremen-based Energiekontor as European
nations seek to install low-carbon generation to meet European
Union clean-energy goals.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
