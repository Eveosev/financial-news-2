Gasoil stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, fell to the lowest in 16 months, according to PJK
International BV.  Gasoil inventories dropped 4.7 percent to 2.26 million
metric tons in the week to today, according to PJK, a researcher
based in the Netherlands. That’s the lowest level since April
22, 2010.  “Nine out of 10 importers have low stocks because of the
backwardation,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone
from Oosterhout, where the company is based. “There is no
incentive to replenish stocks.”  A market is in backwardation when near-term prices are more
expensive than later-delivery. Gasoil for September traded at
$941.25 a ton as of 4:26 p.m. on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in  London . The contract for October was at $936 a ton.  Supplies of the fuel, which includes diesel and heating
oil, were sent to Gibraltar and the Suez area while cargoes
arrived from Russia.  Gasoline stockpiles declined 3.8 percent to 558,000 tons,
as cargoes were sent to Canada, Mexico, Nigeria and South
America, according to PJK data. The fuel arrived from France,
Norway, Russia and the U.K.  Naphtha inventories rose 20 percent to 71,000 tons on
imports from  South Korea , PJK data shows.  Fuel oil stockpiles decreased 1.1 percent to 693,000 tons
on exports to  Singapore , the data shows. Cargoes arrived from
France, Lithuania, Russia and the U.K.  Jet fuel stores increased 2.1 percent to 534,000 tons on
imports from  India  and the United Arab Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
