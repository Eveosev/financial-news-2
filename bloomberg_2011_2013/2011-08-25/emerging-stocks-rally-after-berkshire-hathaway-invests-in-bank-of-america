record profits.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index climbed 0.2 percent to

months, while the Czech PX Index gained 0.9 percent as  Komercni

trading this year through yesterday, is a “strong, well-led
company,” Buffett said. Bank of China Ltd. rose 2.4 percent in
Shanghai after saying first-half profit jumped 28 percent to a
record while bad loans fell.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China (601398)  Ltd., the world’s largest lender by market value, and
 Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  posted earnings that topped
analysts’ estimates after local markets closed.  Investors are awaiting a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman
