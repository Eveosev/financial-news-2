Cie. d’Entreprises CFE SA, the
construction firm that owns half of Dredging Environmental &
Marine Engineering NV, said profit declined 18 percent in the
first half on losses from a cancelled DEME contract in  Brazil .  Net income dropped to 26.2 million euros ($37.7 million),
or 2 euros per share, from 32.1 million euros, or 2.46 euros a
share, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. Revenue
of 870.4 million euros in the first half was little changed from
the year-earlier period.  The fall in profit resulted from “a specific difficulty in
DEME’s environmental business,” the company said. DEME’s
contract for a soil sanitation project in Santos, Brazil, was
terminated in the second quarter “and all losses have been
recognized in the half-yearly financial statements.”  CFE’s full-year revenue “should be comparable to the one
of 2010,” the company said. “With respect to the net result,
the activity during the second half-year should be able to
recuperate all or at least a significant part of the observed
difference at end of June 2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
