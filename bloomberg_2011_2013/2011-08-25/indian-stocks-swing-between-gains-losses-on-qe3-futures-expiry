Indian stocks dropped for a second
day as concern a global slowdown will hurt corporate earnings
countered speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue
efforts to boost the world’s largest economy.  Infosys Ltd., India’s second-largest software services
provider, led a decline among peers.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) ,
the aluminum producer that controls U.S.-based Novelis Inc.,
dropped for the first time in five days.  Jindal Steel & Power
Ltd. (JSP)  plunged to two-year low.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
138.65 points, or 0.9 percent, to 16,146.33 at the 3:30 p.m.
close Mumbai time. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange slid 1 percent to 4,839.60 and its September futures
settled at 4,864.10. The BSE-200 Index lost 0.9 percent.  “Global risk appetite is declining in a big way,” said
Sandeep Tandon, managing director at Quant Broking Pvt., in an
interview with Bloomberg UTV. Indian stocks may “bottom out”
by July next year, he said, adding the Nifty may touch 4,200 if
it drops to less than 4,800.  Investors are awaiting a speech tomorrow by Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  that may signal if he’s planning
further stimulus measures, including a third round of asset
purchases, known as QE3. India’s $1.7 trillion economy grew 7.6
percent in the June quarter, the smallest gain in six quarters,
according to the median forecast of 22 economists before a
report due on Aug. 30.  ‘More Bearish’  Infosys shed 3 percent to  2,183.4 rupees, while larger
rival  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  fell 1.3 percent to 950.4
rupees. The two software exporters get at least 90 percent of
their sales from overseas. The BSE India Information Technology
Index of 10 companies has slumped 31 percent this year.  Mphasis
Ltd. (MPHL) , a unit of Hewlett-Packard Co., tumbled 7.3 percent to
367.25 rupees, the most in six months after its third-quarter
profit fell 28 percent to 1.95 billion rupees ($42.2 million).  “I expect a significant fall in developed markets, the
Euro-zone in particular,” Quant’s Tandon said. “We strongly
believe the  Nasdaq  will outperform in the fall, and hence we are
slightly more bearish on Indian IT companies.”  Hindalco decreased 2.3 percent to 143.3 rupees, ending a
four-day, 6.5 percent rally. Jindal Steel & Power sank 4.6
percent to 470.4 rupees, its lowest close since August 2009.
 Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the biggest maker of the alloy, fell 2.3
percent to 443.7 rupees, its lowest since Sept. 2009.  Bear Market   The Sensex has declined 23 percent from a Nov. 5 peak,
exceeding the 20 percent level that marks a so-called bear
market for some investors, on concern rising inflation and
 interest rates  would hurt company profits. Earnings for 46
percent of Sensex companies missed analyst estimates in the June
quarter, Bloomberg data show. That compares with 33 percent that
lagged behind forecasts in the previous quarter.  Foreign investors sold $182 million more shares than they
bought in the first two days of this week, taking net sales in
August to $1.85 billion, the worst monthly outflow since May
2010, data on the  website  of the market regulator show.  “Markets have been under pressure and it’s been aggravated
by selling coming in from foreign investors, which got triggered
by the U.S. downgrade and the slowdown in the domestic
economy,” said Nilesh Shah, managing director at Envision
Capital Ltd. in Mumbai. “Markets are looking forward to the
central bank’s meeting in mid-September as well as macro-
economic data in terms of inflation and growth.”  The central bank has raised its repurchase rate 11 times
since the start of 2010 to damp living costs that are rising the
fastest among the so-called BRICS nations. The next policy
meeting is on Sept. 16.  India ’s food inflation accelerated for the third time in
four weeks, potentially adding pressure on the central bank to
increase rates further. An index measuring wholesale prices of
farm products including rice and wheat rose 9.8 percent in the
week ended Aug. 13 from a year earlier, the trade ministry said
today. It climbed 9.03 percent the previous week.  The rupee fell to the weakest level in almost a year as
exchange data showed overseas investors increased sales of local
stocks. The rupee’s 4.2 percent loss this month is the worst
performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
