Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) , the largest
independent brokerage by client assets, sued Bank of America
Corp.,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and other banks claiming they manipulated
the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, starting in 2007 in
violation of U.S. antitrust law.  The banks conspired to depress Libor rates by understating
their borrowing costs, thereby lowering their interest expenses
on products tied to the rates, according to the lawsuit filed
Aug. 23 in federal court in  San Francisco , where Schwab is
based.  The banks “reaped hundreds of millions, if not billions,
of dollars in ill-gotten gains,” Schwab wrote.  In separate suits in April, three European asset-management
firms and the Carpenters Pension Fund of West Virginia sued the
banks claiming they manipulated Libor. U.S. and U.K. officials
are cooperating in a probe of possible Libor manipulation, a
person close to the investigation said in March.  The Schwab suit seeks unspecified damages, which may be
tripled under antitrust law. It also includes claims for
racketeering and securities fraud.  “We believe the suit is without merit,” Danielle Romero- Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said in an
e-mail.  Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment.  The case is Schwab Money Market Fund v.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) , 11-cv-4186, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
