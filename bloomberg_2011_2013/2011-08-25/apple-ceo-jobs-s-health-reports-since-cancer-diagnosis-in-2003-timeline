The following timeline details
reports about  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  co-founder Steve Jobs’s health since
his cancer diagnosis in 2003. Jobs resigned yesterday and took
the role of chairman, and Chief Operating Officer  Tim Cook  was
named CEO to succeed him.  October 2003: Jobs is diagnosed with cancer in his pancreas and
tries to treat the illness by switching to a special diet to
avoid surgery, according to a 2008 article in Fortune magazine
citing people familiar with the matter. Apple decides not to
tell investors after consulting lawyers, the magazine said.  Aug. 1, 2004: Jobs, then 49, discloses the cancer for the first
time, saying he had successful surgery to extract the tumor. The
operation removed the cancer in time and he won’t require
chemotherapy or radiation, Jobs says. Cook runs the company
until Jobs returns to work in September.  June 12, 2005: Jobs talks about his fight with cancer during a
 commencement speech  at  Stanford University . He says he was
diagnosed about a year earlier and that doctors told him he
wouldn’t live longer than six months. The cancer turned out to
be treatable with surgery “and I’m fine now,” he says.  June 9, 2008: Jobs, while introducing the iPhone 3G at Apple’s
developers’ conference, appears thinner and frail. The company
blames a “common bug.”  July 21, 2008: Responding to concerns about Jobs’s appearance,
Apple says he has no plans to leave the company and that his
health is a private matter. Investors aren’t reassured, and the
shares fall 10 percent.  July 23, 2008: The New York Times reports that Jobs has been
telling associates and Apple’s board he is cancer-free. Jobs had
a surgical procedure earlier in the year to address a problem
that contributed to his  weight loss , the newspaper reports,
citing unnamed people close to the executive.  Sept. 9, 2008: Jobs, introducing new iPod media players at an
event in  San Francisco , still looks thin. “Reports of my death
are greatly exaggerated,” Jobs jokes.  Dec. 16, 2008: Apple says Jobs won’t give his usual speech at
the Macworld conference. Jobs had used the forum to introduce
new products for 11 straight years.  Jan. 5, 2009: Jobs says he has a hormone imbalance, causing him
to lose weight. Jobs vows to remain CEO during treatment. “The
remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and
straightforward,” Jobs says in an open letter.  Jan. 14, 2009: Jobs gives up day-to-day operations to Cook until
June, saying his health problems are more complex than
originally thought. Jobs says he will remain involved in major
strategic decisions. “I look forward to seeing all of you this
summer,” he says in a letter to employees.  June 23, 2009: Methodist University Hospital Transplant
Institute in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , confirms in a statement that
Jobs had a  liver transplant  and has “an excellent prognosis.”  June 29, 2009: Apple announces Jobs’s return to work. At the
time, Apple shares had risen 70 percent since Jan. 15.  Sept. 9, 2009: Jobs makes his first public appearance since his
return to work, introducing new iPod models in San Francisco. He
says he was the recipient of a liver transplanted from a young
adult who had died in a car crash. “I am back at Apple and
loving every minute of it,” he says.  Oct. 20, 2010: Jobs appears on stage to unveil a lighter MacBook
Air laptop and a version of the Macintosh operating system
called Lion.  Jan. 17, 2011: Jobs begins another medical leave, telling
employees in an e-mail that “I love Apple so much and hope to
be back as soon as I can.” Cook, who received total
compensation of $59.1 million in fiscal 2010 because of bonuses
for filling in for Jobs, is left in charge.  Feb. 23, 2011: Apple shareholders reject a proposal seeking more
disclosure about its chief executive officer succession plan.  March 2, 2011: Jobs, 56, emerges from medical leave to introduce
a new version of the iPad tablet. The appearance assures some
investors that he still participates in decision-making.  March 23, 2011: Walt Disney Co. investors re-elect Jobs to the
board of the entertainment company, rejecting calls from proxy
advisers who said health issues might impair his ability to
serve. Jobs is Disney’s largest shareholder, with about 7.4
percent of the company.  April 11, 2011: CBS Corp.’s Simon & Schuster sets the
publication date for Jobs’s biography for early 2012. Written by
Walter Isaacson and initially titled “iSteve: The Book of
Jobs,” the title is later changed to “ Steve Jobs ” and the
publication date moved up to November 2011. The publisher later
says it will update the biography to include Jobs’s resignation.  Aug. 24, 2011: Jobs resigns as CEO of Apple, handing the reins
to Cook and taking the title of chairman. “I have always said
if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties
and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you
know,” Jobs says in a statement. “Unfortunately, that day has
come.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
