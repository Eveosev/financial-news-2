Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  fell after U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly rose ahead
of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  today
and as selling in German futures sparked a rout in global
equities.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, dropped 2.6 percent from the
closing share price in  Tokyo . Those of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics, slid 0.4 percent. ADRs of  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company and
Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, retreated 1.2 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,745 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,780
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,740 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX
200 Index fell 1.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
dropped 0.1 percent in Wellington.  “Recent U.S. economic reports have shown mixed results,
failing to boost confidence,” said Yutaka Yoshii, a strategist
at Mito Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Expectations have waned about
the possibility that Bernanke will signal further monetary
easing.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The  S&P 500  fell 1.6 percent to 1,159.27 in  New
York  yesterday.  Short-Selling Curbs  A report yesterday showed U.S. jobless claims rose by 5,000
to 417,000 last week. Investors are awaiting a speech by
Bernanke in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , today for any indications of
whether the central bank will signal further economic stimulus.  Declines in stocks intensified as Germany’s  DAX Index (DAX) 
dropped 4 percent in 15 minutes yesterday. Traders sold German
equity futures to hedge their investments before France, Italy
and Spain extended curbs on short selling.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 13 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.8 percent drop by the S&P
500 and an 18 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 11.6 times for the S&P 500 and 9.4
times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
