Following is the text detailing
forecasts for percentage changes in annual food prices,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture:  In 2011, the  Consumer Price Index  (CPI) for all food is
projected to increase 3 to 4 percent. Food-at-home (grocery
store) prices are forecast to rise 3.5 to 4.5 percent, while
food-away-from-home (restaurant) prices are forecast to increase
3 to 4 percent. Although food price inflation was relatively
weak for most of 2009 and 2010, cost pressures on wholesale and
retail food prices due to higher food commodity and energy
prices, along with strengthening global food demand, have pushed
inflation projections for 2011 upward.  The all-food CPI increased 0.8 percent between 2009 and 2010,
the lowest food inflation rate since 1962. Food-at-home prices
increased by 0.3 percent--the lowest annual increase since 1967-
-with cereal and bakery product prices declining 0.8 percent and
processed fruit and vegetable prices dropping 1.3 percent. Food-
away-from- home prices  rose 1.3 percent in 2010, the lowest
annual increase for restaurant prices since 1955.  For 2012, food price inflation is expected to abate from 2011
levels but is projected to be slightly above the historical
average for the past two decades. The all-food CPI is projected
to increase 2.5 to 3.5 percent over 2011 levels, with food-at-
home prices increasing 3 to 4 percent and food-away-from-home
prices increasing 2 to 3 percent. While many inflationary
pressures that drove prices up in 2011 are not expected to
intensify and may even decrease in 2012, retailers have been
slow to pass on cost increases to date. Price levels in 2012
will hinge significantly on weather conditions in the American
Midwest throughout the remainder of the harvest season for major
field crops. Because current USDA forecasts are based on a
normal weather scenario, sustained heat or drought conditions
resulting in reduced supplies and intensified inflationary
pressure would result in revised ERS forecasts.  SOURCE:   U.S. Department of Agriculture   To contact the reporter on this story:
