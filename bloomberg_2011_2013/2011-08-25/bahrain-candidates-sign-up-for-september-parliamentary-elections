Eighty-three candidates have signed
up for next monthâ€™s special Parliamentary elections to fill 18
seats vacated by al-Wefaq, the largest Shiite Muslim opposition
group, Bahrain News Agency said today.  The three-day registration process for the voting, which
will be held Sept. 24, ended at midnight, the agency said. It
said more than 180,000 Bahrainis are expected to cast votes in
the polls. Al-Wefaq said on Aug. 12 that it will boycott the
elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
