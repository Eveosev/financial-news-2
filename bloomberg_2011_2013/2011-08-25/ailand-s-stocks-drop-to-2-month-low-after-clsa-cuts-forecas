Thailand ’s stocks dropped to the
lowest level in almost two months after CLSA Asia-Pacific
Markets lowered its target for the benchmark index by 8.3
percent, citing global economic slowdown.  Thai Union Frozen Products Pcl (TUF)  and other exporters dropped
after a trade ministry official said growth in overseas sales
may slow in the second half. Thai Union, the nation’s largest
seafood supplier, dropped 3.9 percent and Hana Microelectornics
Pcl slid 4.6 percent.  “There is a concern the Thai economy may slow further with
stalled recoveries in the U.S. and  Europe ,” said Sasikorn
Charoensuwan, the head of research at Phillip Securities
(Thailand) Pcl in Bangkok. “Surging exports have been a major
driver for the country’s economy and company earnings growth.”  The SET Index tumbled 2.1 percent to 1,025.00 at the 4:30
p.m. close in Bangkok, the lowest since June 28. The gauge was
 Asia ’s biggest loser today.  CLSA cut its 2011 forecast on the SET Index to 1,100 from
1,200 as a global economic slowdown “will negatively affect
Thailand,” analysts Tim Taylor and Natcha Tanalai wrote in a
note dated today. Thai equities are “no longer cheap” after
gains pushed valuations above its peers for the first time since
2004, Credit Suisse Group AG said on Aug. 23.  Overseas funds sold a net 2.04 billion baht ($28 million)
of Thai stocks today, a sixth day of net outflow, according to
the bourse’s data. That increased the net outflow for the month
to 37 billion baht.  Japan Earthquake  The Southeast Asian nation’s economic growth unexpectedly
slowed last quarter after an earthquake in  Japan  disrupted trade
and as faltering recoveries in the U.S. and Europe cloud the
outlook for global growth.  Gross domestic product increased 2.6 percent in the three
months through June from a year earlier, slowing from a revised
3.2 percent growth in the previous quarter, the government said
on Aug. 22. The median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 3.6 percent gain.  Export growth in the second half may slow compared with the
first half, Yanyong Phuangrach, the commerce ministry’s
permanent secretary, said at a briefing today. The nation’s
overseas sales in July jumped 38.3 percent to a record $21.5
billion, Yanyong said today.  Thai Union slipped 3.9 percent to 55.25 baht, the largest
drop since Aug. 9. Hana, the nation’s largest semiconductor
packager, slumped 4.6 percent to 20.60 baht, the lowest close
since March 8, 2010.  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA) , the biggest
publicly traded rubber producer, slid 7.2 percent to 23.9 baht.  To contact the reporter on this story:
