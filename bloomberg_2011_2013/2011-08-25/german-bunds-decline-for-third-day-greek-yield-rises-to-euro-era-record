Greek bonds slumped, with 10-year
yields rising for an eighth day to a euro-era record, amid
concern Finland’s demands for loan collateral jeopardize
 Greece ’s second bailout package and may trigger a default.  German two-year notes gained after a U.S. report showed
initial jobless claims unexpectedly increased last week, fueling
concern the world’s largest economy is slowing and spurring
demand for the safest assets. The spread between Greek and
German 10-year yields widened to as much as 1,632 basis points,
also the most since the euro was introduced in 1999. The
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.2 percent.  “Markets are doubting whether the second bailout package
will ever be ratified by all the euro-region member states,”
said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at
 Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “There’s not much that can
worsen the situation from where we are now.”  Greek 10-year bond yields rose 45 basis points to 18.34 at
4:33 p.m. in  London , after climbing as high as 18.55 percent.
The 6.25 percent security due in June 2020 fell 1.16, or 11.60
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,437) face amount, to 48.970.  The two-year yield jumped 184 basis points to 45.87
percent, extending a 5.6 percentage point increase over the past
two days. It earlier reached a euro-era record 45.91 percent.  The cost of credit-default swaps insuring Greek debt rose
three basis points to 2,253 basis points, the highest in more
than a month, according to CMA.  Jobless Claims  U.S. jobless claims climbed by 5,000 to 417,000 in the week
ended Aug. 20, the Labor Department said in  Washington .
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a drop to
405,000, according to the median forecast.  Finland ’s Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said the nation
won’t give in to demands to abandon the deal it struck with
Greece over collateral in exchange for bailout loan guarantees.  “If the Finnish and Greek deal isn’t acceptable to others,
it’s now up to all euro members to together build a model that
all find acceptable,” Urpilainen wrote today in an e-mailed
statement. The collateral demand was “no surprise” and will be
maintained, she said.  Greece received a three-year, 110-billion-euro rescue from
the European Union and  International Monetary Fund  last year.
The nation sought a second package this year as its economic
woes stymied plans to return to the capital markets in 2012.  Official Pledges  Pledges of 365 billion euros in official loans to Greece,
 Portugal  and Ireland, as well as at least 96 billion euros of
bond purchases by the  European Central Bank , have yet to fix the
finances of those countries or prevent speculative attacks on
Spain and Italy.  The ECB bought Spanish government bonds today, according to
three people with knowledge of the transactions, extending this
month’s purchases to restrain the nation’s borrowing costs.  The central bank also scooped up Italian debt, two of the
people said, asking not to be identified because the deals are
confidential. An ECB spokesman declined to comment. The central
bank was also said to buy Spanish and Italian debt yesterday.  Spain’s 10-year bonds gained, pushing the yield on the
securities two basis points lower to 4.99 percent, while the
two-year note yield fell seven basis points to 3.25 percent.  Italy’s 10-year yields were little changed at 5.05 percent,
while two-year yields added two basis points to 3.36 percent.
The nation plans to sell 8.5 billion euros of six-month bills
and 2 billion euros of two-year zero-coupon bonds tomorrow.  ECB Buying  The ECB has bought  government bonds  in each of the past
three weeks in a bid to stave off contagion from Greece, Ireland
and Portugal and bring 10-year yields from Spain and Italy below
5 percent. Yields of both nations’ debt had surged to euro-era
records at the start of this month.  The yield on  Germany ’s 10-year bund fell two basis points
to 2.19 percent, after earlier rising to 2.28 percent, the
highest for a benchmark security since Aug. 17. Two-year yields
dropped six basis points to 0.66 percent.  Bunds dropped earlier amid speculation Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will outline additional measures to
help the  U.S. economy  at the central bank’s annual symposium in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  German government bonds have returned 5.4 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
have returned a gain of 6.7 percent. Greek bonds have lost 22
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
