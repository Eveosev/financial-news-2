Shareholders in U.S.-listed
companies can thank  Standard & Poor’s  for making them $1
trillion poorer after the rating firm earlier this month lowered
the grade on Treasury securities for the first time to AA+ from
AAA. Now, some of the most experienced investors say the stock
market losses make no sense.  While the benchmark index for U.S. equities dropped as much
as 6.7 percent, or $1.03 trillion, since the Aug. 5 downgrade,
10-year Treasuries rallied the most in 28 months and the
government was able to finance its quarterly debt obligations at
the lowest interest rates ever. The S&P 500 fell to 12.2 times
earnings the first day after the downgrade, the lowest since
March 2009, while Treasuries have returned 2 percent since.  “One of the most perverse things I’ve seen in 25 years of
doing this is that S&P downgrades the United States government,
and investors’ reaction is to run towards the securities that
they downgrade, selling businesses without asking at what
price,”  Kevin Rendino , a money manager at BlackRock Inc., which
oversees $3.65 trillion in New York, said in an Aug. 23
telephone interview. “Equity prices have swung well too far.”  For Rendino and Liz Ann Sonders of Charles Schwab Corp.,
selling that may have been justified turned indiscriminate
following the reduction, creating bargains in equities. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index jumped 50
percent to 48, the highest level in 29 months and the biggest
jump in more than four years, the first trading day after the
action was announced.  Edward Sweeney , a spokesman for S&P, declined to comment on
whether the rating company’s decision influenced investors’
decisions to sell stocks.  Distracted Investors  The downgrade, which conflicted with Moody’s Investors
Service and Fitch Ratings, turned investors’ focus from the 10th
straight quarter in which  S&P 500  companies topped analyst
earnings forecasts. As of Aug. 8, per-share profits had
increased 18 percent among companies in the index, with 76
percent topping the average analyst projection, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 13 percent.  The new rating from S&P, which cited “uncertainty” in the
policymaking process, is the second-highest and puts the U.S. on
the same level as Belgium and New Zealand, above Japan and
 China . Congressional Republicans warned in November, when
outstanding U.S. debt totaled $13.7 trillion, that they would
oppose raising the ceiling. Lawmakers agreed on Aug. 2 to boost
the limit and adopt a plan to enforce $2.4 trillion in spending
reductions over the next 10 years.  ‘Damage to Confidence’  “It did a lot of damage to confidence, which had been
shaky anyway,” Sonders, New York-based chief investment
strategist at Charles Schwab, said in an Aug. 23 phone
interview. Her firm has $1.65 trillion in client assets. “We
had started to get a sense of a little bit of a lift for the
economy in the second half of the year, and you just kind of
wiped it out because of the lack of confidence in our political
leaders. S&P reflected that with the downgrade, but what it
ended up causing was a real confidence crisis, more than an
economic crisis.”  Demand for Treasuries surged since the downgrade, helping
send the yield on the 10-year note, the benchmark for home
mortgages and car loans, to a record low 1.97 percent on Aug.
18. The bonds have returned 3.1 percent this month, poised for
the biggest return since December 2008, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data through Aug. 23.  The Treasury sold $35 billion of two-year notes on Aug. 23
at a record low yield of 0.22 percent as investors continued to
seek the world’s safest securities as refuge from financial
market turmoil and a slowing economy. It was the first of that
maturity to be sold after the downgrade.  Dollar Gains  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the world’s reserve currency against six major trade
partners, gained 0.3 percent on Aug. 8. The dollar has gained
0.6 percent this month, the sixth-biggest advance among 10
developed-nation currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes through Aug. 23. The biggest gainer is
the franc, up 3.9 percent.  S&P, a New York-based unit of McGraw-Hill Cos., erred when
it lowered the ranking and the U.S. merits a “quadruple A,”
 Warren Buffett , the chief executive officer of Omaha, Nebraska-
based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . said in an Aug. 6 interview.
Berkshire Hathaway made its biggest bets on the stock market on
Aug. 8, the day the downgrade sent the S&P 500 to its worst
plunge in more than two years, Buffett said in a television
interview with  Charlie Rose  broadcast Aug. 15 on PBS.  ‘Very Strong’  Under S&P’s definitions, debt rated AA is barely different
from AAA securities and shows that a borrower’s ability to
“meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very
strong.”  Stocks were falling before S&P took action as record
 interest rates  in Spain and Portugal spurred the  European
Central Bank  to resume bond purchases and Congress debated the
U.S. debt ceiling, said Warren Koontz of Loomis Sayles & Co. in
Boston. The S&P 500 slumped 4.8 percent on Aug. 4, its biggest
retreat since 2009, and had lost 11 percent since July 22 as
reports showed the world’s largest economy grew 0.4 percent in
the first quarter and 1.3 percent in the second.  “The downgrade wasn’t good, but more important for the
selloff was the concern about Washington gridlock over the debt
ceiling and the slowdown in  Europe ,” Koontz, who helps manage
about $160 billion as head of U.S. large-cap value stocks at
Loomis Sayles, said in an Aug. 23 telephone interview. “If we
hadn’t been in an economic soft patch and if we hadn’t had the
debt-ceiling ruckus, then we might not have had the downgrade,
so I don’t think the timing was a surprise.”  Worse Than Market  McGraw-Hill declined 15 percent in the two trading sessions
following the downgrade, more than twice the S&P 500’s loss in
the same period.  S&P said on Aug. 22 that it will replace President Deven Sharma with Citibank NA Chief Operating Officer Douglas Peterson
at the end of the year as the ratings company faces regulatory
scrutiny. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is looking into the
downgrade decision, a committee aide briefed on the matter said
Aug. 8. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also
scrutinizing the method S&P used and whether the firm protected
the confidential decision, a person with direct knowledge of the
matter said Aug. 15.  “The fact that S&P’s president is stepping down is
interesting timing,”  Quincy Krosby , a market strategist for
Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential Financial Inc., said in an
Aug. 23 telephone interview. Her firm manages $883 billion. “It
begs the question whether S&P thought that everything was fine
with this downgrade, its timing and its consequences.”  ‘No Connection’  “There’s no connection between the downgrade of the U.S.
and Mr. Sharma’s departure,” S&P’s Sweeney said in a phone
interview.  Peterson became head of Citigroup’s Japan operations in May
2004, a role he kept until January 2010. In November 2004, he
became the first foreigner to testify before a Japanese
parliamentary committee after regulators found Citigroup’s local
private bank failed to conduct proper money-laundering checks.  “My mandate is to fix problems,” Peterson said during 90
minutes of questioning by lawmakers from governing and
opposition parties in the upper house. The probe forced
Citigroup to close the private bank and send then-Chief
Executive Officer Chuck Prince to  Tokyo , where he apologized to
regulators and bowed in a gesture of remorse.  Most Since 2008  The S&P 500’s 6.7 percent drop on Aug. 8 was the biggest
daily decline since December 2008, the height of the financial
crisis spurred by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy.
The index has lost 12 percent since July 22, as the debate about
extending the debt-ceiling spurred concern the U.S. government
would default. It alternated between gains of losses of more
than 4.4 percent in the four days after the downgrade, the first
time that’s ever happened.  Shares of financial firms and banks led declines since the
downgrade, losing 5.5 percent as a group. Energy companies and
technology stocks have lost more than 3.2 percent. The S&P 500
Aerospace & Defense Index, made up of companies from  Northrop
Grumman Corp. (NOC)  to  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  that depend on U.S.
government spending for revenue, has declined 3.2 percent in the
same period.  Northrop, the third-largest U.S. defense contractor, fell 5
percent even after saying second-quarter earnings exceeded
analyst projections on July 27. While the shares are beating the
S&P 500 by 2.2 percentage point so far this week, companies that
don’t rely on the government for a significant portion of
revenue, such as  Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. (HST)  and  Monster
Worldwide Inc. (MWW) , have also declined.  Host Hotels  Host Hotels, which owns Ritz-Carltons in  San Francisco  and
Phoenix, posted second-quarter funds from operations that beat
the average analyst forecast by 3.1 percent on July 20, boosting
the shares 2.6 percent that day. After the U.S. was downgraded,
even a projection for the best earnings growth in six years
couldn’t keep the stock up. It has fallen 19 percent, the sixth-
biggest loss in the S&P 500.  The plunge in U.S. stocks that began July 22 pushed
valuations down as much as 27 percent by Aug. 8. That was the
fastest drop in the price-earnings ratio in 18 months, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The benchmark index traded at 12.2
times reported earnings on Aug. 8., the lowest since the bull
market began in March 2009, and it has been hovering around that
level since then, as investor fear failed to subside wholly.  ‘Very Attractive’  “It’s definitely appropriate to be worried, and it’s
normal for people to think about the closest precedent, which is
the 2008 credit crisis in the U.S.,” Chris Hyzy, the New York-
based chief investment officer at U.S. Trust, which oversees
about $360 billion, said in an Aug. 23 telephone interview.
“However, there are vast differences between that time period
and what is occurring around the world now, and therefore the
markets have corrected too far, making these current levels very
attractive.”  Investors sold stocks in August and October 1995 on concern
that budget negotiations would fail between President Bill Clinton and Congress, shutting the government. The dispute
between House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , a Republican, and Democrat
Clinton prompted Moody’s to review some U.S. government bonds
for a downgrade in January 1996.  The average price-earnings ratio in 1995 was 16.6, 15
percent below its level in 1994, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. As the debate over federal spending led to two government
shutdowns that year, the S&P 500 ended up rallying 5.9 percent
in November and December and went on to gain 48 percent by 2000.  Upside in Equities  The reduction of the U.S. credit rating gave investors
another reason to avoid equities amid uncertainty about the
political and economic situation in the world’s largest economy,
according to Andrew Slimmon, managing director of global
investment solutions at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, which
has about $1.7 trillion in client assets.  “The downgrade was just one more thing that caused
investor anxiety to grow,” Chicago-based Slimmon said in a
telephone interview. “We’ve come to the point where the one
question to be answered now is whether we are going to have
anything worse than a mild recession,” he said. “If we can
avoid that, then there’s obviously a lot of upside in the equity
market.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
