Nobel laureate  Robert Mundell  said
he doesn’t expect the U.S. or Europe to slide into recession
again.  “I think we’re in a double-dip slowdown, I don’t see a
recession coming,” Mundell told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg
Television’s “On The Move” today from in Lindau, Germany.  Mundell, who is professor of economics at Columbia
University in New York, also said that the U.S. should cut its
corporate taxes and make permanent the tax cuts enacted by
former President  George W. Bush  to boost its economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
