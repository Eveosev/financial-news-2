Coffee shipments from  Vietnam , the
world’s second-largest exporter after  Brazil , may have fallen 49
percent to 40,000 metric tons in August from the year before
after accelerating sales earlier in the year thinned stocks.  The preliminary figures, which may be revised, compare with
exports of 78,000 tons in August 2010 and 53,000 tons last month,
according to data from the  General Statistics Office , which also
released shipment figures for rice and rubber today. Coffee
exports in the first eight months of the year were forecast at
958,000 tons, 11 percent higher than a year earlier.  Vietnam is the largest shipper of robusta beans, used to
make instant drinks. Robusta in  London  jumped 24 percent in the
first five months of this year before sliding in June, according
to Bloomberg data. High global prices spurred Vietnamese farmers
to sell 90 percent of the latest crop by May, according to a
Bloomberg survey that month.  “Coffee exports have slowed these days since there is not
much coffee left,” said Bui Hung Manh, head of the business
department at  Tay Nguyen Coffee Investment, Import and Export
Co. , the country’s biggest shipper. “Domestic coffee prices
were so good this year, reaching record highs above 50,000 dong
($2.40) a kilo, which prompted people to sell faster than in
previous crops.”  The price of coffee in Vietnam’s main producing region of
 Dak Lak  reached 51,600 dong per kilogram on June 1, the highest
since at least 2006, Bloomberg data shows.  Vietnam, the world’s second-largest rice exporter, may ship
600,000 tons this month, compared with 615,000 tons in August
last year and 652,000 tons last month, according to statistics
office figures. In the January-to-August period, rice exports
may have totaled 5.31 million tons, 6.5 percent more than the
same period last year, the office said.  Sufficient Stockpiles  Demand for Vietnamese rice has increased in traditional and
new markets this year, the Vietnam Food Association said on July
15. Vietnam had signed export contracts for 6.4 million tons
this year as of Aug. 23, up 9.6 percent from the year-ago period,
the government said in a statement on its website today.  Vietnamese companies currently hold more than 1.3 million
tons of rice in stockpiles, sufficient to meet export contract
demand for the remainder of the year, according to the statement.
Vietnam is targeting 7.4 million tons of exports this year, Diep Kinh Tan, deputy minister of agriculture and rural development,
told Bloomberg last month.  Rubber shipments from the world’s fourth-biggest exporter
may total 85,000 tons this month, down 18 percent from August
last year, according to statistics office figures. Exports in
the January-to-August period may have risen 5.6 percent from a
year earlier to 454,000 tons.  Supplies from Vietnam may decline 9.4 percent in the third
quarter as farmers delay latex tapping after a spread of leaf
disease, the  Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries 
said in an e-mailed report July 28. Rubber exports may total
834,500 tons this year, the agriculture ministry said in its
July forecast report, compared with 782,200 tons in 2010,
according to  General Statistics Office  figures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
