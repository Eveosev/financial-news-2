(Corrects name of bank in final paragraph of story
published Aug. 25.)  Nigeria  will sell three nationalized
lenders to investors on the condition that there won’t be job
cuts, said Mustafa Chike-Obi, chief executive officer of Asset
Management Corp. of Nigeria, which runs the banks.  “In selling the banks, Amcon is prepared to concede some
value to the buyer just to protect the workers,” he said in a
speech today in Lagos, the commercial capital. The state-
controlled banks have attracted attention from investors that
think “it is the right time to invest when shareholders are out
of the way and no more a risk,” he said.  The central bank of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer fired the
chief executives of eight of the nation’s 24 lenders in 2009
after a debt crisis threatened the banking industry with
collapse. It bailed out eight lenders with 620 billion naira ($4
billion) and Amcon was set up to buy bad debts, allowing the
banks to resume lending and rebuild their balance sheets.  Three of the bailed-out lenders, Afribank Plc, Bank PHB Plc
and Spring Bank Plc, were taken over by the government on Aug. 5
after they were deemed unlikely to recapitalize. They were
handed over to Amcon to manage.  Union Bank Nigeria Plc, Intercontinental Bank Plc, Finbank
Plc, Oceanic Bank International Plc and Equitorial Trust Bank
Plc, have signed agreements to be acquired by other lenders
ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
