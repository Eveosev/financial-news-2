(Corrects number of rooms in fourth paragraph in story
published on Aug. 25.)  Four Seasons Hotels Inc., which
manages 85 hotels globally, said it plans to open a new property
in Okinawa,  Japan , as early as 2014 to expand its hotels under
management globally.  The Toronto-based hotel management firm is currently in
talks with investors and partners for the new hotel on the main
island of Okinawa, said Christopher Hart, president of hotel
operations for the Asia-Pacific region at Four Seasons.  “We have been interested in having more hotels in Japan,”
Hart said in an interview in Tokyo today. “We are in active
discussion with partners.”  Four Seasons has been in Japan since it took over the
management of Chinzan-so hotel in Tokyo two decades ago. It also
manages a 57-room hotel in Marunouchi, the city’s most expensive
business district.  Its rival  the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. , a Marriott
International Inc. brand, said in June it plans to open a hotel
in Okinawa in April 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
