Colombia ’s peso fell to a two-week
low as a sell-off in global equities eroded demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso dropped 0.2 percent to 1,790.50 per dollar at 3:55
p.m. New York time, from 1,786.31 yesterday. It earlier fell to
as low as 1,796.27, its weakest level since Aug. 11. The decline
pared the currency’s gain to 6.6 percent this year.  U.S. stocks dropped following a plunge in Germany’s DAX
Index amid speculation the European country’s regulators may
impose more restrictions on the equity market. Central bankers
from around the world meet this week in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming,
for a conference that last year resulted in Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaling a second round of asset
purchases, known as QE2, to stimulate the economy.  “What we’re seeing today in markets is pure  risk
aversion ,” said Santiago Melo, an analyst at brokerage Alianza
Valores in Bogota. “All this concern over slowing global
growth, what’s happening in  Europe  and speculation on whether
Bernanke will announce more measures or not this week is leading
to declines in equity markets and hurting the peso.”  The peso will likely weaken further should Bernanke hold
off on indicating plans to embark on further stimulus, according
to Daniel Lozano, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Serfinco
SA.  “The peso had gained, incorporating expectations of a
QE3,” Lozano said. “And if no announcement is made, it’ll
probably correct further.”  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.39
percent. The price fell 0.282 centavo to 121.224 centavos per
peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
