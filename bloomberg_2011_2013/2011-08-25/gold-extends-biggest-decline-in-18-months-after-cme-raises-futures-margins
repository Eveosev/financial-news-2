Gold fell, heading for the biggest
three-day drop in almost three years, as investor demand wanes
after a rally to a record.  Futures rose as much as 18 percent this month, touching an
all-time high of $1,917.90 an ounce on Aug. 23, before erasing
most of the gains. The value of a 100-ounce futures contract in
 New York  plunged $10,400 yesterday, more than the $7,425 margin
requirement that day, prompting exchange-owner CME Group Inc. to
increase the minimum cash deposit on trades.  “It looks nasty, but this is a normal correction given the
magnitude of the move,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The
parabolic move finally collapsed.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $16.10, or 0.9
percent, to $1,741.20 at 11:57 a.m. on the Comex in New York. A
close at that price would leave the most-active contract down 8
percent since Aug. 22, the biggest three-day slump since October
2008. In London, gold for immediate delivery was down $18.27, or
1 percent, at $1,741.05.  The metal is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. Central
banks are adding to reserves for the first time in a generation,
joining billionaire investors including  John Paulson  in hoarding
bullion. The  Federal Reserve  has taken the unprecedented step of
saying it will keep borrowing costs at almost zero percent at
least through mid-2013 to support the economy.  ‘Not Safe’  “Gold is a trade, gold is a position, gold is volatile,
but gold is not safe,”   Dennis Gartman , an economist, wrote
today in his Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter. “The
public is involved in gold, and the cab drivers of the world
have bought into it. Now they are being taken out, at high
cost.”  The Chicago-based CME raised margin requirements after gold
futures surged to a record this month and then plunged the most
since March 2008. The minimum cash deposit required to trade
Comex futures will rise 27 percent to $9,450 per contract in the
speculative Tier 1 category at the close of trading today, CME
said late yesterday. The maintenance margin will rise to $7,000
from $5,500. The Shanghai Gold Exchange said Aug. 23 it will
hike margins from settlement today.  “In our opinion, the margin is not nearly high enough
yet,” Gartman said. “Proper margining would seem to be closer
to $15,000 per contract.” Given the volatility in trading,
“the exchange needs to protect itself and its clients” from
the possibility of a large speculator or two putting “the
exchange into jeopardy,” he said.  Speculator Holdings  Speculators held a net 218,403 futures and options
contracts as of Aug. 16, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Positions reached 253,653 contracts by
Aug. 2, the most since at least 2006. The CFTC will update its
tally tomorrow.  The 10-day historical volatility for gold futures jumped to
41 percent, the highest level since March 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Gold, which had fallen as much as 3 percent earlier, pared
losses after U.S. equities resumed their slump. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index is still headed for a weekly gain after
declining 16 percent in the previous four weeks.  Silver Futures  After CME’s series of margin increases in April for silver,
the metal slumped as much as 35 percent in the following three
weeks. The price touched a 31-year high of $49.845 an ounce on
April 25 and fell as low as $32.30 on May 12.  Gold’s surge and decline is similar to silver’s earlier
this year, John Roque, WJB Capital Group’s senior technical
analyst, said in a note to clients.  “Gold has some support at $1,700, but it wouldn’t surprise
us to see the metal retest its last breakout level at $1,580,”
Roque said.  Gold is still trading above its 200-, 100- and 50-day
moving averages. The price is below the 20-day moving average of
$1,743.50.  Silver futures for December delivery rose $1.124, or 2.9
percent, to $40.325 on the Comex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
