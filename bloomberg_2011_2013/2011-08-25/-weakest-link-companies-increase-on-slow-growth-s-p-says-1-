Slowing global growth triggered a 10
percent rise in the number of “weakest link” companies, those
rated B- or lower with negative outlooks, in the past month,
 Standard & Poor’s  said.  There are now 120 companies, with rated debt of $362
billion, in the category, up from 109 a month earlier, S&P said
in a report today. The companies will dominate defaults in the
coming quarters, according to the report.  “The U.S. accounts for 81, or 67.5% of the total,” Diane Vazza, the firm’s head of global fixed-income research, said in
the report. “Media and entertainment, banks, and forest
products and building materials are the top three sectors by
number of weakest links.”  The number of weakest links peaked at 300 in April 2009,
and stood at 133 a year ago, the ratings company said. Among the
latest companies included in the group are Peachtree City,
Georgia-based Global Aviation Holdings Inc., the chartered
flight company,  Catalyst Paper Corp. (CTL)  in Richmond, Canada, and
Dallas-based cement maker  Texas Industries Inc. (TXI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
