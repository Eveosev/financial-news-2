Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson ended his seven-year boycott on talking to the British
Broadcasting Corp.  “Sir Alex and the  BBC  have put behind them the
difficulties which led to Sir Alex feeling unable to appear on
BBC programs,”  BBC Sport  reported on its website, citing a
joint statement by the BBC and Ferguson.  Ferguson hasn’t spoken to the BBC on team matters since
2004, when the public broadcaster made allegations about his son
Jason’s activities as a soccer agent in a television
documentary. He lifted the ban after he spoke to the BBC’s
director general,  Mark Thompson , and BBC North director Peter
Salmon.  “The issues have been resolved to the satisfaction of both
parties,” the statement said. “Sir Alex will now make himself
available to the BBC for Match of the Day, Radio 5 Live and
other outlets as agreed.”  United, a record 19-time English champion, plays Arsenal at
Old Trafford this weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
