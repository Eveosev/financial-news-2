South Africa ’s government said there
must be caution in releasing Libyan funds to rebels in that
country as the  United Nations  hasn’t recognized them as the
legitimate authority.  South Africa isn’t opposed to unfreezing the assets to be
used for humanitarian purposes, Clayson Monyela, spokesman for
the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, told
reporters in Cape Town today. The African Union will announce
tomorrow who it sees as the legitimate authority in Libya and
South Africa will take its lead from that, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
