An earthquake aftershock early today
may have jarred loose a granite railing on the U.S. Treasury
Department’s roof, prompting the Secret Service to close a
sidewalk along the building, a Treasury official said.  The damage to the downtown Washington building, about five
stories up, wasn’t visible after the initial earthquake Aug. 23,
according to the official, who spoke to reporters today and
couldn’t be identified under department briefing rules.  The first temblor measured magnitude 5.8 and was centered
between Washington and Richmond,  Virginia , and damaged some
buildings in the U.S. capital, including the Washington
Monument, which has been closed. Today’s aftershock measured
magnitude 4.5 when it rumbled through the region at about 1 a.m.
Washington time, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  The Secret Service’s police division closed the 15th Street
NW sidewalk with yellow tape as a precaution. There were no
signs that debris fell from the roof of the Treasury Department,
which is located next to the White House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
