Mohamed  bin Hammam , who challenged
Sepp Blatter for the presidency of soccer’s governing body,
appealed his lifetime ban from the sport on bribery allegations
and said he’s ready to take the case to sports’ top tribunal.  Hammam, who was head of the Asian soccer confederation, was
banned in July after being found guilty of buying votes for the
FIFA leadership contest against Blatter. He said the ban was
politically motivated.  “I will continue my battle until I prove my innocence and
that my suspension was a political decision and an absolute
abuse of power to deprive me of my right to contest for FIFA
presidency,” Bin Hammam wrote on his personal blog.  Bin Hammam allegedly offered Caribbean football officials
envelopes containing $40,000 each. He pulled out of the
presidential race when originally suspended, so that Blatter
retained the post unopposed.  Bin Hammam said on his blog he had little hope of success
with the appeal to FIFA but would use it as a step toward a
hearing at sports’ top tribunal.  “I have submitted my case to the FIFA Appeals Committee,
not hoping for justice to prevail but as a protocol to enable me
to obtain access to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,” he
said.  FIFA confirmed that its appeal committee “received the
declaration of appeal of Mr. Bin Hammam within the deadline.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
