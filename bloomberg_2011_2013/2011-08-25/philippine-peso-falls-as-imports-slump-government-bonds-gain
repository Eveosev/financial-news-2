The Philippine peso fell for a
second day as a slump in the nation’s imports fanned concern the
economic outlook is deteriorating.  Government bonds  gained.  The currency has weakened 0.9 percent this month on concern
a faltering U.S. recovery and a worsening debt crisis in  Europe 
will hurt exports. Imports, which include raw materials and
capital goods used to manufacture items for overseas markets,
dropped 7.9 percent from a month earlier in June, after sliding
11.1 percent in May, government data showed today. Annual growth
rates for May and June were the lowest in a year.  “Imports have been in a decelerating mode” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “There’s not
much optimism among local manufacturers to step up purchases
when you don’t see sustainable end demand. Capital imports have
been quite under the weather.”  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 42.515 per dollar as of
the 4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. UBS
AG lowered its end-2011 forecast for the currency to 43 from 42
today, citing the deteriorating global growth outlook.  The yield on the 7 percent bonds due April 2016 declined
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.67 percent,
according to prices from the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  The government reported a 26.5 billion pesos ($623 million)
deficit for July, the biggest shortfall in 2011, as revenue
climbed at the slowest pace this year, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
