Mauritian exporters should expand
into other industries to help offset the effects of the
currency’s gains, central bank Governor Rundheersing Bheenick
said.  “Those who are not competitive need to have ways and means
to move to new sectors and markets to survive,” Bheenick told
business executives in Ebene, south of the capital,  Port Louis ,
today. “The country is not just for exporters.”  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, earns most of its
foreign exchange from exports of manufactured goods and tourism.
The rupee has strengthened 11 percent versus the dollar this
year, making it the second-best performer among African
currencies after  Mozambique ’s metical, which has gained 18
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange
market and will continue to do so within its current mandate,
the governor said.  Exports rose 26 percent to 17.8 billion rupees ($641
million) in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, the
 Central Statistics Office said on May 31 .  To contact the reporter on this story:
