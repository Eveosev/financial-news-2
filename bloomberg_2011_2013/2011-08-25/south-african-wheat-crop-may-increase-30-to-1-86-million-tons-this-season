South Africa ’s wheat crop may
increase by 30 percent to 1.86 million metric tons this season
compared with a year earlier, according to the country’s Crop
Estimates Committee.  The reason for the increase is because of favorable
production conditions for wheat, Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman
for the Committee, said by phone from Pretoria today.  The committee also forecast that the national barley crop
will rise 28 percent to 248,920 tons and canola will rise 55
percent to 57,340 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
