Ghana ’s finance minister,  Kwabena Duffuor , gave lawmakers an amended version of a $3 billion
Chinese loan agreement, hours after it was withdrawn on
transparency concerns raised by politicians from an opposition
party.  The changes were adopted by members of the Accra-based
Parliament and debate on the bill, which includes funding for a
natural gas project in the country’s Western region, was put off
to tomorrow, said Edward Doe Adjaho, first deputy speaker.  “We need ample time to thoroughly study this document to be
able to debate meaningfully on the floor,” Minority leader Kyei
Mensah Bonsu said in an interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
