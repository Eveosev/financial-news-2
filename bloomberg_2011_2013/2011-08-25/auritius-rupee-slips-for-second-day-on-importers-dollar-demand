Mauritius’s rupee depreciated for a
second day against the dollar as importers bought the U.S.
currency to settle payments for their goods.  The currency weakened as much as 0.9 percent to 28.1 per
dollar and traded 0.2 percent down at 27.9 by 12:24 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, heading for its lowest
level since Aug. 22. Against the euro, the rupee slipped 2.2
percent, the most since Aug. 19, to 40.3521.  “The rupee has a slight tendency to weakening today as we
see importers shopping dollars to meet their bill obligations,”
Oumesh Mungroo, treasurer at Barclays Bank Plc’s Mauritian unit,
said in a phone interview from Ebene.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation with a population
of 1.3 million, is a net importer of fuels and food commodities
with 67 percent of its import bills denominated in dollars,
according to Bank of Mauritius data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
