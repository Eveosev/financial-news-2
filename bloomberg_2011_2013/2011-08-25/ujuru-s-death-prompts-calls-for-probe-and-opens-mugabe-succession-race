Zimbabwe’s Vice President Joice Mujuru called for a probe of her husband’s death in a fire, an
event that may influence who succeeds President  Robert Mugabe  as
head of his political party.  Solomon Mujuru, the former head of the liberation army that
propelled Mugabe to power in 1980, was found dead after a fire
at a house on a farm he owned in Beatrice near the capital
Harare, the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Font party said on Aug. 16. The 62-year-old supported his wife’s
appointment in 2004 and was a member of the party’s top decision
making body.  “We need a thorough investigation because my husband was a
fit military man and it is very difficult to understand how he
was trapped in the house,” Joice Mujuru said in comments
broadcast late on Aug. 23. Windows in the house were low enough
for her grandchildren to “jump in and out with ease,” she said
in a separate interview with the state-controlled  Herald 
newspaper yesterday.  Joice Mujuru is pitted against Defense Minister, Emmerson
Mnangagwa and Constantine Chiyengwa, the head of  Zimbabwe ’s
armed forces, to succeed the 87-year old Mugabe, three party
officials familiar with the situation said in June. The death of
Solomon Mujuru will damage his wife’s chances, Takavafira Zhou,
a political lecturer at the University of Masvingo in central
Zimbabwe, said on Aug. 16.  “Mujuru’s death has clearly left a huge gap in Zanu-PF.
He was the king-maker in a party with unsteady factions and
fluid loyalties,” Judy Smith-Hohn, an analyst at the Pretoria-
based  Institute for Security Studies , said in an interview.
“His death is bad news for Zimbabweans and foreigners. The
Mujuru faction is the pro-business faction in Zanu-PF and it has
been weakened.”  Groceries, Cell Phone  “It’s suspected that the fire was used to mask evidence,
because the general’s groceries were still in his car along with
his cell phone,” Wilf Mhanda, a former guerrilla and now leader
of the war veterans department of the Movement for Democratic
Change, which governs Zimbabwe in a coalition with Zanu-PF, said
in an interview. “I am surprised that Mugabe hasn’t called for
an independent investigation.”  Police and fire department officials investigating the
blaze have interviewed over 20 people, including three policemen
assigned to guard the general at the farm, police spokesman
Wayne Bvudzijena said in an interview from Harare yesterday. He
didn’t give further details.  “It was single storey, had more doors and windows than a
colander has holes in it,” Guy Watson-Smith, a former owner of
the farm, said in an e-mailed reply to questions last week.
“The roof was asbestos and the walls brick and cement. How can
you not get out of that?”  Car Accidents  A number of rivals for Zanu-PF’s leadership and critics of
the government have died in accidents over the past four
decades.  In 1975 Herbert Chitepo, then leader of the party, died in
a bomb explosion and in 1979 Josiah Tongogara, the then leader
of the liberation army, was killed in a car accident.  In 1995 Chris Ushewokunze, a finance minister who clashed
with Mugabe over policy, died in a car accident and Witness
Rukarwa, a provincial governor critical of Mugabe, perished in a
vehicle accident. Former ministers Moven Mahachi and Elliott
Manyika died in car accidents in 2001 and and 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
