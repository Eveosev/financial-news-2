Saskatchewanâ€™s harvest is 9 percent
complete, behind the previous five-year average of 10 percent,

About 64 percent of the winter wheat has been harvested, along
with 69 percent of fall rye, 37 percent of lentils, 34 percent
of field peas, 5 percent of canola and 6 percent of mustard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
