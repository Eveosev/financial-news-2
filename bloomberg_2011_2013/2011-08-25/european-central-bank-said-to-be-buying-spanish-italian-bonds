The  European Central Bank  bought
Spanish  government bonds , according to three people with
knowledge of the transactions, extending this month’s purchases
to restrain the nation’s borrowing costs.  The central bank also bought Italian debt, according to two
of the people, who asked not to be identified because the deals
are confidential. A spokesman for the central bank declined to
comment. The ECB was also said to buy the nations’ debt
yesterday.  The yield on Spanish two-year bonds slid four basis points
to 3.28 percent as of 12:01 p.m. in  London  after rising to 3.35
percent earlier. The extra yield, or spread, investors demand
for holding 10-year Spanish securities instead of German bunds
fell to 274 basis points from 280 basis points yesterday.
Italian two-year notes pared losses, yielding 3.35 percent
compared with 3.38 percent earlier.  The ECB started buying Spanish and Italian bonds on Aug. 8
to halt contagion from the crisis in  Greece , Portugal and
Ireland from spreading to the two larger countries, whose
combined government securities outstanding are double Germany’s
indebtedness. The purchases are part of its Security Market
Program, which was set up last year to stabilise markets roiled
by the debt crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
