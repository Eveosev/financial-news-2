GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the
largest Chinese maker of silicon used in solar panels, said
first-half profit grew more than fourfold on rising sales.  Net income rose to HK$3.6 billion ($462 million) from
HK$788 million a year earlier, the company said today in a
statement. Sales increased 162 percent to HK$15.2 billion.  Chinese producers are expanding to meet growing demand as a
result of the country’s push to use more power generated from
the sun. The government has set fixed preferential power prices
for solar power plants to encourage domestic installations.  “ China  will transform from a country which manufactures
photovoltaic products to a major user,” GCL-Poly said.  The company, based in  Hong Kong , is testing output at a new
plant with annual capacity of 15,000 metric tons of polysilicon.  The producer rose 5.5 percent to HK$3.47 by the close of
Hong Kong trading and before the earnings announcement.  GCL-Poly, which gained about 75 percent of its first-half
sales from wafers, said in March it would more than double
polysilicon capacity to 46,000 tons this year.  China, the biggest energy consumer, will install as much as
1.6 gigawatts of solar plants this year, doubling capacity from
the end of last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
