AZ Electronic Materials SA (AZEM) , a maker
of chemicals for flat-panel television sets that sold shares to
the public in October, posted a first-half profit as it sold
more compounds used in mobile phones and Apple Inc.’s iPad.  Net income was $40.9 million, or 10.7 cents per share, for
the period ending June 30, compared with a loss of $321.4
million, or 151.9 cents, a year earlier, when AZ had higher
financing costs associated with its private-equity ownership,
the Luxembourg-based company said today in a statement. Sales
increased 22 percent to $391.8 million.  “We’re seeing strong growth in the memory that fuels the
iPads and the mobile displays,” Chief Executive Officer Geoff Wild said in a telephone interview. “We are gaining market
share and additional layers and applications for our materials
faster than any slowdown in the market.”  About 80 percent of AZ’s sales come from  Asia , and the
company expects demand for its chemicals, which are used to
produce  flash memory , microprocessors and hard disk drives, to
increase in countries such as Japan and  South Korea  even amid
uncertainty over global growth, Wild said.  AZ may spend as much as $25 million on research and
development for the second half of the year, about the same as
during the past six months, and will return $15 million to
shareholders with its first dividend in October, Wild said.  Shares advanced as much as 10 percent to 232.6 pence and
traded at 231.7 pence at 9:58 a.m. in London, giving the company
a market value of 882.6 million pounds ($1.5 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
