Odebrecht Oleo & Gas SA , a Brazilian
oil services provider, expects to finalize a $500 million loan
by October to buy a drillship and benefit from booming demand
for exploration equipment from companies such as  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA. (PETR4)   Odebrecht is negotiating the financing with Banco Santander
SA, HSBC Holdings Plc and BNP Paribas SA, Chief Financial
Officer Mario Augusto da Silva said in an interview. The seven-
year loan will have a rate of about 260 basis points above the
London interbank overnight rate, known as Libor, in line with
the company’s previous project loans, he said.  “We’re in a high growth phase,” Silva said yesterday in a
telephone interview. “The growth that’s expected for the entire
sector, for Petrobras -- it’s huge.”  The offshore rig will be able to operate in deep waters
where Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras is developing the largest
discoveries in the Americas in more than three decades, Silva
said. The unit brings Odebrecht’s offshore fleet to seven rigs
and one production platform, double what the company had in late
2009.  Odebrecht isn’t currently considering a share sale in
 Brazil  to finance investments because the company has enough
capital, Silva said. Odebrecht Oleo & Gas Chief Executive
Officer Roberto Ramos said in June the company was considering a
share sale as early as 2012.  Odebrecht said yesterday it received a standby revolving
credit facility of $200 million. The company negotiated the
terms of both loans in the first half of this year, Silva said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
