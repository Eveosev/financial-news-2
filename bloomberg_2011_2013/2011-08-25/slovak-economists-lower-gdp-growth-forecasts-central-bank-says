Economists at Slovak banks lowered
their forecasts for economic growth in 2011 and 2012 amid signs
economies in western  Europe  are slowing more than previously
expected, the central bank said citing a survey.  The average forecast for growth this year by economists at
seven local banks fell to 3.1 percent from 3.6 percent predicted
last month, Narodna Banka Slovenska said on its  web page . Next
year, the economy is seen expanding 2.9 percent compared with a
July forecast of 4.3 percent.  An expected slowdown in western Europe will hurt the
export-oriented Slovak economy, which relies on foreign demand
to fuel growth. It may threaten meeting the target to reduce the
budget gap to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product next year,
forcing the administration to take more spending cuts.  The government expects the economy to advance 3.6 percent
this year and 4.4 percent in 2012. The Finance Ministry will in
September release an update of the forecast, which will be
incorporated in the final version of the 2012 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
