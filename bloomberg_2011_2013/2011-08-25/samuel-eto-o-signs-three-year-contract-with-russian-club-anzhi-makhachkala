Samuel Eto’o, the record four-time
African player of the year, signed a three-year contract with
Russian soccer club Anzhi Makhachkala.  Eto’o, 30, will play in the No. 99 jersey after signing
last night following a medical examination, the Russian club
said late yesterday on its  website  without disclosing financial
terms of the contract.  Anzhi, based in the capital of the southern Dagestan
region, said two days ago that it had agreed on a transfer fee
with  Inter Milan  that “fully satisfied both sides.” Anzhi will
pay Inter as much as 21 million euros ($30 million) for Eto’o,
the British Broadcasting Corp.  reported , citing Anzhi spokesman
Alexander Udaltsov.  Eto’o, who scored 53 goals in 103 games in two seasons with
Inter, will be paid about 10 million euros a year, the  BBC  cited
Udaltsov as saying.  Anzhi is owned by billionaire Suleiman Kerimov and includes
former Brazil World Cup-winning defender Roberto Carlos and ex-
Chelsea player  Yuri Zhirkov  on its roster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
