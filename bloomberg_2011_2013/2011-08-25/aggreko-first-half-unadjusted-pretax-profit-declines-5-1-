Aggreko Plc (AGK) , the worldâ€™s largest
supplier of mobile power supplies, said first-half unadjusted
pretax profit declined 5 percent as fewer major sporting events
were held in the period.  Unadjusted pretax profit for the six months to June 30 was
120.7 million pounds ($197.9 million), the company said in a
regulatory statement today. Underlying trading profit, which
excludes one-off sporting events held in 2010, such as the
soccer World Cup, rose 17 percent. Revenue increased 9.2 percent
to 637.2 million pounds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
