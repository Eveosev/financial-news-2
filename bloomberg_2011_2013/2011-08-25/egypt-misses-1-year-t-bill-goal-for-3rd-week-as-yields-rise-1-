Egypt  missed its fund-raising target
for one-year treasury bills for the third week as the average
yield on the securities rose to the highest level in almost
three years.  The Arab country raised 1.4 billion Egyptian pounds ($235
million) out of the 3.5 billion it had sought at an auction
today, according to data posted on the  Ministry of Finance 
website. The average yield was 12.985 percent, the highest since
November 2008. It sold the target 2.5 billion pounds in six-
month treasury bills at an average yield of 12.552 percent, up
from 12.481 percent last week.  “The government is firm on not allowing the yield on one-
year notes to breach the 13 percent level, especially as it
seeks to sell two-year floating bonds soon,” said Ahmed Kheir
Eldin, fixed-income trader at Cairo-based Bank of Alexandria.
“If investors can earn a good spread above six-month bills by
buying one year notes, the two-year floating rate bonds will not
be appealing.”  The  Finance Ministry  postponed the sale of two-year
floating-rate bonds earlier this week as yields on treasury
bills rose. The bonds would pay investors a spread, yet to be
announced, over the yield on six-month treasury bills. The
ministry sold two-year fixed-rated bonds on Aug. 15 at an
average yield of 13.29 percent.  The central bank will later today probably keep the
benchmark overnight deposit rate at 8.25 percent, the lowest
since 2006, according to five economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. It hasn’t changed the rate since September 2009.  Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due April 2020
advanced, pushing the yield down 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.57 percent at 2:40 p.m. in Cairo. The
pound was little changed at 5.9596 per dollar after gaining 0.3
percent, the most since February, yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
