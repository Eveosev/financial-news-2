The Syrian-European Group for Heavy
Industries plans to build a plant that will produce oil rigs
from 2016,  Al Watan  reported, citing a government official.  The company is partnering with  Russia ’s Uralmash Machine
Building Corp. to produce the country’s first drilling rig by
early 2016 from the plant that will cost at least 250 million
euros ($362 million), the newspaper said, citing Syrian Deputy
Oil Minister Hassan Zainab. The factory will manufacture about
10 rigs a year and export some of them to Middle Eastern
markets, according to the newspaper.  Syrian-European, established in  Syria  in 2007 and located
in an industrial compound near the central city of Homs, will
also produce the nation’s first locally made wind turbine to
generate electricity in early 2012, Zainab said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
