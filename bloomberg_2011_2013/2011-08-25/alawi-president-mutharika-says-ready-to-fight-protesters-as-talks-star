Malawian President Bingu wa Mutharika said he is “ready for a fight” with civil-society
groups that have led protests against his government as United
Nations-backed talks on ending the dispute started.  “I will deal with the non-governmental organizations which
are leading people to protest against my leadership,” Mutharika
said in a speech in Blantyre, the commercial capital, today.
“My patience is wearing thin, let us fight.”  The groups had questioned the credibility of a government
delegation that held talks with them today, he said.  Nineteen people died in the southern African nation in
clashes with police during protests on July 20 and 21 against
government policies and a shortage of fuel and foreign currency,
according to the government. The groups, including the Institute
of Policy Interaction, the Malawi Law Society and the Council of
Churches, called off a second round of demonstrations planned
for Aug. 17 to allow for the UN-backed talks.  The U.S. and U.K. have cut aid to Malawi, which depends on
donors for as much as 40 percent of its budget, because of
disagreements with Mutharika and the police’s response to
protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
