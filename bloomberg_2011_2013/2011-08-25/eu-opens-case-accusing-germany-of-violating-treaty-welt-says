The European Union has begun
proceedings against  Germany , accusing the government of
violating the EU treaty regarding the free movement of people,
 Die Welt  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The case comes a year after proceedings against  France  for
deporting Roma people, the newspaper said. According to EU law,
relatives of people living in EU nations should be allowed to
follow their next of kin if they have lived with the relative in
their state of origin or if the next of kin guarantees their
living costs, Welt reported. Germany has approved only the most
serious cases, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
