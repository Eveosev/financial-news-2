Assore Ltd. (ASR) , a South African owner
of mines, said full-year profit more than doubled on increasing
demand and higher prices for iron ore.  The company, based in Johannesburg, reported net income of
3.2 billion rand ($440 million) in the year ended June 30,
compared with 1.5 billion rand a year earlier, it said in a
statement today. Sales gained 47.8 percent to 11.2 billion rand.  Assore, joint owner of manganese producer Assmang Ltd. with
 African Rainbow Minerals Ltd. (ARI) , spent 2.8 billion rand to develop
infrastructure at the Khumani Iron Ore Mine and raise output to
16 million metric tons a year by mid-2012, from 10 million tons.  While demand in the  iron ore  market is tight, a recovery in
manganese and chrome ore and alloy prices is unlikely, it said.
Power and other costs in  South Africa  are hurting smelters.  “We expect challenging economic and trading conditions for
the year ahead,” Chairman Desmond Sacco said in the statement.  Assore, which mines manganese, chrome and iron ore, as well
as producing ferroalloys for the steel industry, fell 2.4
percent to 208 rand at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The company declared a final dividend of 2.50 rand a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
