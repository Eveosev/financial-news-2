Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending rate, opened at 0.12 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.08 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.03 percent to 0.14 percent and averaging 0.09 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire $250 million to $500 million
of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing from April
2013 to February 2041, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York’s website. The purchases are part of the Fed’s policy
to continue to reinvest the proceeds of maturing assets on its
balance sheet to prevent a tightening of monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
