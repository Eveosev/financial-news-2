Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) ,  South
Africa ’s biggest food and general goods wholesaler, posted a 26
percent drop in annual profit because of costs of selling a
controlling stake to  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)   Net income declined to 838.7 million rand ($115.6 million)
in the 52 weeks ended June 26, from 1.13 billion rand a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Sales rose 12 percent to 53.1 billion rand in the period
and the dividend was unchanged at 3.86 rand a share.  Massmart had transaction costs of 408.8 million rand
related to the Wal-Mart deal. Benefits from the sale of the 51
percent stake to  Bentonville , Arkansas-based Wal-Mart may only
be seen as of fiscal 2013, according to the statement.  In the first eight weeks of fiscal 2012, sales climbed 13.5
percent “indicating perhaps either another market share gain,
or a healthier than expected consumer,” Massmart said.  Massmart shares rose 0.7 percent to 151.99 rand as of 9:31
a.m. in Johannesburg trading. The stock has risen 3.6 percent
this year compared with a 3.8 percent gain for the FTSE/JSE
Africa General Retailers Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
