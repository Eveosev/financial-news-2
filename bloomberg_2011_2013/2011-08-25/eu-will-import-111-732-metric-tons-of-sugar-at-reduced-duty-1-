The European Commission accepted
offers to import 111,732 metric tons of sugar at reduced duty
rates, under the third of five planned tenders to alleviate
tight supplies.  Raw sugar imports under today’s tender will total 84,292
tons, while white, or refined, sugar will account for 27,440
tons, the commission, the European Union’s executive arm, said
in an e-mailed statement today. The lowest duty to be paid will
be 170.06 euros ($245.60) a ton, on 83,535 tons of raw-sugar for
refining, while the highest will be 250 euros a ton on the
27,440 tons of white sugar, it said.  The 27-nation bloc backed a proposal in May to import the
sweetener at a reduced rate and authorized duty-free imports of
200,000 tons of sugar to boost supplies in the region. The EU
also allowed 300,000 tons of imports at zero duty earlier this
year, bringing the total of duty-free imports to 500,000 tons.  The commission accepted offers to import 152,208 tons of
sugar on July 28, and 64,364 tons of sugar on July 14, bringing
the total amount of sugar to be brought into the bloc at reduced
duty to 328,304 tons.  The results of the next tender will be decided in two
weeks, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
