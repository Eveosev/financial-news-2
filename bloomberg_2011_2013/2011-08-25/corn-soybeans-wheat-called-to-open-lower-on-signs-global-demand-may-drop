What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade after a government report showed
declining U.S. export sales for the marketing year that starts
Sept. 1,  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in
West Des Moines, Iowa, said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that demand for U.S. supplies may slow,
after a recent rally in prices, Roose said. Soybean-oil futures
are expected to open down 0.25 cent to 0.3 cent a pound, and
soybean-meal futures may open 80 cents to $1 lower for 2,000
pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on signs of increasing world supplies, boosting
competition for U.S. exports, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
