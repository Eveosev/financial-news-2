The European Club Association,
representing 197 European soccer clubs, could separate from the
sport’s governing body FIFA in 2014 if the organization doesn’t
reform, the Swiss magazine  Bilanz  cited Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as saying in an interview.  The association has a memorandum of understanding with FIFA
and with the European governing body UEFA that ends in 2014.
“After this, we are not bound to accept FIFA’s regulations
any more,” Rummenigge, who is also chairman of  Bayern Munich ,
said in a preview of an article to be published tomorrow. FIFA
President Sepp Blatter needs to lead an active reform,
“especially with the themes of democracy, transparency and
governance,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
