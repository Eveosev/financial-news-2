Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , rose to the highest in eight weeks, data from the
Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
increased 1.6 percent to 20.2 million barrels in the week ended
Aug. 24,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Supplies are at the highest since June 29.  Stockpiles of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, fell 8.6 percent to 13 million barrels, the lowest
since June 1. Light distillates such as naphtha, reformate and
gasoline dropped 1.6 percent to 9.8 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
