The  Bank of Canada  bought C$600
million ($609 million) of securities for one day.  The central bank announced the purchase, aimed to keep
overnight lending rates close to its current target of 1
percent, on its website today from Ottawa.  The amount of settlement balances in the Large Value
Transfer System was also increased today to C$81 million from
the regular daily target of C$25 million. The funds are used to
help settle payments between banks and brokers, and a higher
amount can also encourage lower  interest rates  on interbank
loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
