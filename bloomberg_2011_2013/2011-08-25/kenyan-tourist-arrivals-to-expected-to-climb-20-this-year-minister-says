Tourist arrivals to  Kenya , East
Africa’s biggest economy, will probably increase 20 percent in
2011 from a year earlier as the number of visitors from India
and  China  rises, Tourism Minister Najib Balala said.  Kenya, the home of wild-game parks including the Maasai
Mara in the southwest and Indian Ocean beaches, is targeting 3
million visitors by 2015, Balala told reporters today in the
capital, Nairobi.  Arrivals of tourists in the first half of 2011 climbed
almost 14 percent to 549,083. Earnings in the  tourism industry 
in the first six months surged 32 percent to 40.5 billion
shillings ($436 million), Balala said.  “Most of the markets have recovered fully and are growing
at an impressive level,” he said.  Kenya plans to build an international convention center in
the coastal city of Mombasa by the end of the year and a similar
facility, to be called Lake Victoria Convention Center, in
western Kenya at a later date, Balala said. The Mombasa complex
will be built on a 15-acre parcel of land provided by Bamburi
Cement Co., the Kenyan unit of the  Lafarge SA (LG) , he said.  Tourism accounts for 11 percent of Kenya’s gross domestic
product and is the second-biggest foreign-currency earner after
horticulture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
