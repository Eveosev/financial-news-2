Gold rebounded in  New York , halting
the biggest decline since 2008, as slumping global equities
revived the appeal of the precious metal as a haven asset.  Global stock markets fell, sending the MSCI World Index of
equities down as much as 1.4 percent, as French, Italian and
Spanish regulators extended temporary bans on short selling
introduced this month. Gold prices tumbled 7.1 percent in the
previous two sessions, after gaining as much as 18 percent this
month to an all-time high of $1,917.90 an ounce on Aug. 23.  “Gold is making a comeback,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a
strategist at MF Global in Chicago. “Flight-to-quality fears
still persist, and gold is putting on its risk-aversion hat.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $5.90, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,763.20 at 2:03 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the metal fell as much as 3 percent to $1,705.40
and was headed to the biggest three-day slump since October
2008.  “Sellers tried to force gold under $1,700 and couldn’t, so
the funds came back,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago. “This is long-term
buying against the equities.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell as much as 1.8 percent
today, heading for the first decline this week. The index
dropped 16 percent in the previous four weeks.  The metal is up 24 percent this year, headed for the 11th
straight annual gain as investors seek to diversify away from
equities and some currencies.  Hoarding Bullion  Central banks are adding to reserves for the first time in
a generation, joining billionaire investors including  John Paulson  in hoarding bullion. The  Federal Reserve  has taken the
unprecedented step of saying it will keep borrowing costs at
almost zero percent at least through mid-2013 to support the
economy.  Yesterday, the value of a 100-ounce futures contract
plunged $10,400, more than the $7,425 margin requirement that
day, prompting exchange-owner CME Group Inc. to increase the
minimum cash deposit on trades.  “It looks nasty, but this is a normal correction given the
magnitude of the move,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The
parabolic move finally collapsed.”  The 10-day historical volatility for gold futures jumped to
40 percent, the highest level since March 2009, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Margin Moves  Gold’s surge and decline are similar to moves in silver
earlier this year, John Roque, WJB Capital Group’s senior
technical analyst, said in a note to clients.  The CME made a series of margin increases in April for
silver, which fell as much as 35 percent in the following three
weeks. The price touched a 31-year high of $49.845 an ounce on
April 25 and fell as low as $32.30 on May 12.  “Gold has some support at $1,700, but it wouldn’t surprise
us to see the metal retest its last breakout level at $1,580,”
Roque said.  Gold is still trading above its 200-, 100- and 50-day
moving averages. The price is below the 20-day moving average of
$1,743.50.  Silver futures for December delivery rose $1.592, or 4.1
percent, to close at $40.793 on the Comex. The metal has gained
32 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell $3.90, or 0.2 percent, to $1,822.40 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery rose $8.10, or
1.1 percent, to $753.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
