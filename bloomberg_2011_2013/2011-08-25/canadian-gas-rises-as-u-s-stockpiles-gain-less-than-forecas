Canadian natural gas prices rose
after a report that U.S. stockpiles of the fuel rose less than
expected.  Inventories rose 73 billion cubic feet to 2.906 trillion in
the week ended Aug. 19, the Energy Department reported today.
Analysts in a Bloomberg survey estimated an increase of 74
billion. Stockpiles trail the five-year average level of 2.961
billion cubic feet.  “It’s a pretty healthy number,” said Carl Neill, an
energy consultant with Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta.
“There’s been some liquidation of natural gas and now we’re
seeing some buyers coming back.”  Alberta  gas for September rose 3.5 cents to C$3.435 per
gigajoule ($3.31 per million British thermal units) as of 11:10
a.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S., and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta
system.  Gas for September delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 4.7 cents to $3.969 per million Btu.  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet as of 9:30 a.m. in New York, 74 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3.17 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.91 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.12 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.64 billion cubic feet today, about 59
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.7
billion cubic feet at 9:35 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
