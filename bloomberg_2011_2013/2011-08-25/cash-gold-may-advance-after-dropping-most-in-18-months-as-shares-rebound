Gold fell for a third day, extending
its biggest drop since February 2010, after  CME Group Inc. (CME) 
raised futures margins for a second time this month, prompting
some investors to sell the metal after a rally to a record high.  Bullion for immediate delivery dropped as much as 1.7
percent to $1,729.45 an ounce and traded at $1,742.38 at 2:43
p.m. in Singapore. The metal slumped 3.8 percent yesterday as
better-than-estimated U.S. economic data boosted the dollar and
cut demand for safe assets before central bankers from around
the world gather on Aug. 26 for an annual meeting.  Gold has dropped 8.9 percent from its record $1,913.50 on
Aug. 23 in “a correction that we have to have,” said Justin Smirk, senior economist at Westpac Institutional Bank, a unit of
Australia’s Westpac Banking Corp. “Near-term there’s still a
lot of reason for gold to outperform other commodities because
we don’t think that problems are being resolved.”  Gold is in the 11th year of a  bull market  and has gained 22
percent this year as investors seek to diversify their holdings
away from equities and some currencies. The metal is still up
6.3 percent in August, heading for its second monthly increase.
Exchange-traded-product holdings, which reached a record 2,216.8
metric tons on Aug. 8, fell for a fourth day yesterday. Assets
shrank 26.9 tons to 2,154.714 tons, the largest outflow since
January, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  CME, the largest futures market, raised margins by 27
percent with effect from the close of business today, it said in
a  statement . The initial-margin requirement, or the minimum
amount of cash that speculators must keep on deposit, will rise
to $9,450 per 100-ounce contract from $7,425. The maintenance
margin also rises 27 percent to $7,000 from $5,500, it said.  Downward Pressure  “It’s going to put some downward pressure on gold as
investors are forced to stump up more margin to cover any
positions they have,” said Darren Heathcote, head of trading at
Investec Bank ( Australia ) Ltd.  The December-delivery contract fell 1.3 percent to 1,734.60
an ounce on the Comex. Futures, which touched their highest ever
$1,917.90 on Aug. 23, tumbled 5.6 percent yesterday, the most
since March 2008.  The CME joins the Shanghai Gold Exchange in hiking margins.
 China ’s largest physical gold market will increase the trade
margin requirement for its gold forward contracts for the second
time in a month from settlement today, it said on Aug. 23.  “It’s not just the price move that day,” Harriet Hunnable,
CME’s head of metals products, said in an interview Aug. 22, on
why it alters margins. “It’s definitely not the price up or
price down. When volatilities go up, we make a decision to put
the market on notice that we will raise margins.”  Margin Increases  Earlier this year, the CME announced five margin increases
for silver after prices jumped to a 31-year high of $49.845 an
ounce on April 25. In two weeks, it became 84 percent more
expensive for speculators to trade the metal, triggering an exit
by investors and sending silver down by the most since 1983.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will deliver a
speech tomorrow at  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming . At last year’s
conference, he hinted at a second round of asset purchases to
stimulate the  U.S. economy .  Orders for U.S. durable goods beat economists’ forecasts
while  home prices  increased the most since September 2005,
trimming expectations of further so-called quantitative easing.
The dollar gained against a six-currency basket including the
euro and yen yesterday and was last little changed. Asian stocks
rose for a second day.  The downgrade in expectations has “provided a decent
backdrop for U.S. dollars,” Steward Hall, senior currency
strategist at RBC Dominion Securities Inc., said. “Growth
proxies were sold” and “gold, the traditional first line of
defence against the monetary printing press, fell hard.”  Cash silver gained 0.5 percent to $39.935 an ounce, spot
platinum was little changed at $1,812.25 an ounce and palladium
climbed 0.5 percent to $751.63 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
