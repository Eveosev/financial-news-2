French voters want  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the former International Monetary Fund chief who
won dismissal of sexual-assault charges in  New York , to avoid
speaking out in the 2012 presidential race, a poll showed.  The CSA institute survey for 20 Minutes, RMC radio and BFM
TV showed that  53 percent of the respondents  said he should not
engage in politics in the coming months, while 23 percent said
they want him to participate in his Socialist Party primary in
October, and 19 percent want him to back a candidate.  Paris-based CSAâ€™s survey was completed Aug. 22 and 23 and
is based on the answers of 863 voters aged 18 and older. CSA did
no publish a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
