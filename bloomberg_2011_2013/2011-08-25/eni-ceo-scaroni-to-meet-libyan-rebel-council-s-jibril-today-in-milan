Eni SpA (ENI)  Chief Executive Officer
Paolo Scaroni will meet Mahmoud Jibril, prime minister of the
Libyan rebel council, in Milan today to discuss the country’s
oil production after the rebellion to overthrow Muammar Qaddafi.  Eni, the biggest foreign investor in Libya, earned about 13
percent of its revenue there before the conflict broke out in
February. The company, which entered the Libyan market in 1959,
a decade before the military coup that brought Qaddafi to power,
plans to invest another $25 billion there in the next decade.
Libya has Africa’s largest oil reserves.  Jibril is in Milan to meet with Italian Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi . The Libyan leader met with French President
Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris yesterday and called on the United
Nations to unfreeze Libyan assets that had been controlled by
Qaddafi to help the rebel council start rebuilding the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
