Societe Generale (GLE)  SA cut its
forecasts for growth in the U.S. and other economies and pushed
back expectations for central banks to raise  interest rates  to
reflect damage from financial turmoil in America and Europe.  The U.S. will grow 1.6 percent this year against a previous
prediction of 2 percent, and 1.8 percent next year instead of 3
percent, the Paris-based bank said in a research note today. The
 Federal Reserve  will not raise rates until 2015, it said, versus
an earlier prediction of mid-2013. The  European Central Bank  and
Bank of England will be on hold until 2013, the forecasts show.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost as much as $1 trillion
since the U.S. was stripped of its AAA rating by S&P on Aug. 5.
At the same time, officials in  Europe  are struggling to agree on
a rescue plan for debt-strapped countries such as Greece and
Spain and salvage the future of the euro.  “Damage has already been done to the world economy, and
the U.S. and Europe are now growing at close to stall-speed,”
the note said. “Outright recession, however, needs a trigger,
which is currently absent.”  Societe Generale also lowered its forecast for global
growth in 2011 to 3.9 percent this year and next from earlier
predictions of 4.2 percent and 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
