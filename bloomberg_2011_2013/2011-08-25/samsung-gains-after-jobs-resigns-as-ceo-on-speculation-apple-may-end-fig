Samsung Electronics Co.,  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s biggest competitor in smartphones and tablet computers,
rose in Seoul trading on speculation the company may benefit
after  Steve Jobs  resigned as chief executive officer of Apple.  The maker of the Galaxy phones and tablet computers climbed
2.4 percent to 725,000 won at the 3 p.m. close in Seoul trading,
the highest level since Aug. 17. The stock was the biggest
contributor to the 0.6 percent gain in the benchmark  Kospi
Index. (KOSPI)   LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s third-largest mobile-
phone maker, added 1.3 percent.  Jobs’s resignation is positive for Samsung, which is locked
in a patents battle with Apple regarding its Galaxy products,
said Seo Won Seok, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co.
in  Seoul .  “Given that the key driver of Apple has been Jobs’s
creativity and ideas, Korean companies may find opportunities in
his absence in the longer term,” Seo said by phone. Tim Cook,
named as Jobs’s successor, may try to improve the relationship
with Samsung, Seo said.  Apple has filed patent cases against handset makers that
use Google Inc.’s Android operating system, including Samsung,
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. and HTC Corp.  Jobs, who transformed Apple from a personal-computer also-
ran into the world’s largest technology company, yesterday
announced his resignation amid a battle with cancer that led to
a liver transplant in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
