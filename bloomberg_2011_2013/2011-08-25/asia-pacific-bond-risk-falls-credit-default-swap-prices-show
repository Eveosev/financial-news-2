The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against default decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2.5 basis points
to 172.5 basis points as of 10:10 a.m. in Sydney, Credit
Agricole CIB prices show. The risk benchmark is on course for
its first decline since Aug. 17, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 basis point to 165 basis points
as of 8:10 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Credit Agricole
prices.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 1 basis point to
156 basis points as of 9:09 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The index soared 12.3 basis points yesterday after
Moody’s Investors Service cut the nation’s rating by one level
to Aa3, according to CMA prices in  New York .  Five-year swaps on Japan’s sovereign debt fell 1 basis
point to 112, Deutsche Bank prices show. The contracts increased
3.5 basis points yesterday, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
