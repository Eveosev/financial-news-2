Tanzania’s shilling weakened for the
first time in three days against the dollar as commercial banks
bought the U.S. currency.  The currency of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
depreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 1,633 per dollar and
traded at 1,624 by 12:54 p.m. in the commercial capital, Dar es
Salaam.  “Banks have been buying dollars, which companies seeking
shillings to meet monthly obligations are supplying,” Yonoh
Mtengule, chief economist of National Bank of Commerce, Absa
Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by phone today. “The inter-bank
market today influenced the market trend.”  The shilling has depreciated 8.6 percent this year, making
it Africa’s third-worst performer against the dollar after
Uganda and Kenya’s currencies. The currency has weakened as
Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 13 percent in July, the
fastest pace in 15 months, on higher energy and food costs.  Tanzania vies with Mali to be Africa’s third-biggest
producer of gold after  Ghana  and  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
