India ’s central bank eased rules for
companies to borrow from overseas debt markets to help boost
economic growth.  The  Reserve Bank  of India waived the requirement of average
maturity, prepayments and options to call back and repay
overseas borrowings, according to an e-mailed statement in
Mumbai today. The  relaxed  rule applies to the $250 million of
additional borrowing allowed last year, the central bank said.  The government on Sept. 16 raised the cap on foreign
borrowings without approvals by 50 percent to $750 million.  The central bank also allowed companies to sell as much as
$750 million of convertible debt abroad without its approval in
any financial year, according to today’s statement.  Funds from overseas will aid India’s plans to double
spending on infrastructure including roads, ports and power to
$1 trillion in the next five years and spur economic expansion.  India’s economy grew 6.9 percent in the three months ended
Sept. 30, the weakest pace since the second quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
