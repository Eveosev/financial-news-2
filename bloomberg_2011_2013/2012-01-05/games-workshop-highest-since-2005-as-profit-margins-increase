Games Workshop Group Plc (GAW) , the U.K.
maker of “Warhammer” battle games, rose to its highest since
April 2005 after announcing increased profit and margins.  First-half net income was 43 percent higher than a year
earlier, at 6.9 million pounds ($10.7 million), the Nottingham,
England-based company said today in a Regulatory News Service
statement. The company said it will pay a dividend of 29 pence a
share on Feb. 24.  “The Warhammer hobby is in really good health,” Charles Hall, an analyst at Peel Hunt who has a “buy” recommendation,
said by phone. “The outlook is positive as there’s some
momentum on the sales line and margins are improving.”  The stock rose as much as 11.7 percent, and was up 8.9
percent, at 490 pence, at 9:00 a.m. in London trading.  “As a niche business, we, in general terms, neither
benefit nor suffer from macroeconomic factors as our current
results show,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
