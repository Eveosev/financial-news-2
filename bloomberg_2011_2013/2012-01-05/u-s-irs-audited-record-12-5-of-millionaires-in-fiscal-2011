The U.S.  Internal Revenue Service 
said it audited 12.48 percent of individual  tax returns (USCBTAXR)  with
income exceeding $1 million during fiscal 2011, a high reached
at a time of debate over the taxation of top earners.  The announcement marks the third consecutive year that the
IRS increased its audit rate on returns showing income of more
than $1 million. According to IRS data, the previous record was
the 8.36 percent of returns in that category audited during
fiscal 2010.  “We’ve always tried to make sure there was equity in the
system,” Steven Miller, deputy IRS commissioner for services
and enforcement, said in a telephone interview today.  Miller said the higher rate of audits on top earners can be
attributed to a greater focus on income held outside the U.S.  “We have done a lot of work in the offshore area,” Miller
said.  The IRS released the data as protesters have occupied parks
in dozens of U.S. cities over the past several months to
highlight perceived income inequality. Democrats and Republicans
in Congress have repeatedly clashed during the past year over
the Democrats’ proposal to impose a surtax on annual income over
$1 million.  The audit rate also climbed for corporations with more than
$250 million in assets. The IRS said it audited 27.6 percent of
these businesses, up from 25.3 percent in fiscal 2010.  $55.2 Billion  The IRS said it collected $55.2 billion from overall
enforcement activities during fiscal 2011. That is down almost
4.2 percent from the $57.6 billion the agency collected from
audits the previous year.  The audit rate for individuals in all income brackets
remained constant at 1.11 percent in 2011 while the rate for
small corporations -- those with assets less than $10 million --
rose to 1.02 percent from 0.94 percent in 2010.  Miller said the IRS will conduct audits this year with
about 3,000 fewer enforcement personnel than in 2010. He said
the reduced workforce wouldn’t diminish the agency’s tax
collection efforts.  “We’ll be fine,” Miller said. “What we’re going to try
to do is make sure we’re going to invest where we need to
invest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
