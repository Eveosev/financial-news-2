Egypt ’s stocks retreated the most in
more than a week led by  Orascom Construction Industries (ORCI)  on
concern a protest later this month may further destabilize the
North African country and slow economy growth.  Orascom Construction  declined 1.2 percent after it said
damage to equipment at a power plant that was attacked is
estimated at no more than 10 million Egyptian pounds ($1.7
million).  Talaat Moustafa Group Holding (TMGH) , Egypt’s biggest
publicly traded real-estate developer, dropped the most in more
than a week. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell for the third day,
losing 0.7 percent, the most since Dec. 28, to 3,627.80 at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The measure rose 0.2 percent this
week.  “People are already concerned about phase two of the
revolution on Jan. 25,” said Wafik Dawood, director of
institutional sales at Cairo-based Mega Investments Securities.
“We don’t see any catalysts ahead of the long weekend and in
general the market still lacks appetite.”  Clashes in Cairo last month between security forces and
demonstrators calling for an earlier end to military rule left
at least 17 people dead. Protesters are preparing to take to the
streets on Jan. 25 to mark the anniversary of the mass rallies
that drove former president  Hosni Mubarak  from power. Egypt’s
market will close on Jan. 8 to mark a Coptic Christmas holiday.  Egypt’s stock measure, which slumped 49 percent in 2011,
was the third-worst performing equity index tracked by Bloomberg
last year after markets in Greece and Cyprus.  Orascom Construction fell to 200.81 pounds, the lowest
close since Dec. 28. Egypt’s biggest publicly traded builder
resumed normal operations at the site that was set ablaze on
Jan. 3. Talaat Moustafa slumped 3.4 percent, the most since Dec.
28, to 2.87 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
