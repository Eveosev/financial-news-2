Galeries Lafayette SA (GL) , a French
department-store operator, said sales rose about 3 percent in
December compared with the same month in 2010 amid concerns that
the country is entering a recession.  All 62 stores in  France  registered growth, Virginie David,
a spokeswoman for Paris-based company, said by e-mail today. She
declined to provide full-year figures for 2011, saying it was
too early to do so, or an outlook for 2012. “Last year was
already a record in term of sales,” she said, without
elaborating. Revenue was 2.86 billion euros ($3.7 billion) in
2010, according to the company’s website.  French  consumer confidence  held near its lowest in almost
three years in December as the public remained concerned about
unemployment and said financial conditions were worsening,
national statistics office  Insee  reported today. The country’s
shoppers were predicted by Deloitte LLP to increase holiday
spending by only 1.9 percent because of the region’s sovereign
debt crisis.  A mild winter in France weighed on demand for coats and
sweaters, David said. Galeries Lafayette will cut prices between
30 percent and 60 percent on some items, the same level as last
year, during the Jan. 11 to Feb. 14 sales period, David said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
