Airbus (EAD)  SAS, the world’s biggest
commercial planemaker, beat its target of handing over 520 to
530 planes this year, two people familiar with the figures said.  Airbus, which has built and handed over more planes than
rival  Boeing Co. (BA)  every year since 2003, will have a final
delivery tally that’s several more than 530, said the people,
who asked not to be identified ahead of an official announcement
on Jan. 17.  Boeing fell short of a revised annual goal of about 480
planes by three aircraft, it said today. The Chicago-based
manufacturer said in October that it would miss a goal of 485 to
495 planes amid production delays on new 787 and 747-8 models.
In the end it handed over 477 planes in 2011.  While aircraft makers get the biggest payments upon
delivery, new contracts at Airbus carry initial pre-delivery
payments of as much as 5 percent upon signature, with 20 percent
of the sales price paid out in stages. At Boeing the final
payment equals 40 percent of the contract price.  The U.S. planemaker delivered three Dreamliners and nine
747-8 freighters, lagging behind a combined goal given in
October of 15 to 20 of the aircraft.  Boeing has said it will begin deliveries this year of the
747-8 Intercontinental, the passenger version of its biggest
model. The first handover had been set for late 2011. Boeing
also delivered 73 of its 777s last year, as well as 20 767s and
372 of the 737, the world’s most widely flown plane.  European Aeronautic, Defence and Space Co., the parent
of Airbus, rose 1.3 percent to 24.89 euros in Paris trading,
extending its six-month gain to 5.7 percent. Boeing declined
1.2 percent to $73.45 at 11:54 a.m. in  New York , for a six-month
drop of 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
