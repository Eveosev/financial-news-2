Pitcher Carlos Zambrano was traded to
the Miami Marlins from the  Chicago Cubs , ending 11 years marked
by a no-hitter, All-Star appearances, and clashes with teammates
and management.  The Marlins said in a statement that they acquired Zambrano
for another right-hander, Chris Volstad, and cash. The club also
said they re-signed infielder Greg Dobbs to a two-year contract.  The 30-year-old Zambrano, a three-time All-Star, was 125-81
with a 3.60 earned run average with the Cubs from 2001 to 2011.  Zambrano went 9-7 last season before being ejected from an
Aug. 12 game against the  Atlanta Braves  for throwing inside to
Chipper Jones after giving up back-to-back home runs and five
homers in the game.  The Cubs placed him on the disqualified list the next day,
and suspended him for 30 days without pay. Zambrano considered
retirement before changing his mind, according to MLB.com.  Chicago will pick up all but $2.5 million of the $18
million Zambrano is owed this year, according to the statement
on the Marlins’ website.  Zambrano, who threw a no-hitter in September 2008, was
fined by the Cubs the previous season after getting into a
dugout fight with Michael Barrett, his catcher, after a poor
outing.  With fellow Venezuelan Ozzie Guillen becoming manager this
offseason, Zambrano is the Marlins’ latest high-profile player
signing, after shortstop  Jose Reyes  and pitchers Heath Bell and
 Mark Buehrle .  Volstad, 25, was 32-39 with a 4.59 ERA since making his
debut with the Marlins in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
