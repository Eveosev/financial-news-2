Norway’s capital requirements are not
transparent enough and place its banks at a competitive
disadvantage in the Nordic region, DNB ASA Chief Financial
Officer Bjoern Erik Naess wrote in an opinion article in Dagens
Naeringsliv.  Norwegian banks have higher risk-weighting on lending than
Swedish banks, Naess wrote in the Oslo-based newspaper. Methods
of calculating and risk weightings should be harmonized
throughout the Nordic region, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
