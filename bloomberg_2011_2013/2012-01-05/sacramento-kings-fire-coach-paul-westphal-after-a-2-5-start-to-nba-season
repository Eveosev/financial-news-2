The  Sacramento Kings  fired coach Paul Westphal after starting the season 2-5, the National Basketball
Association team said in a statement.  Assistant coach Keith Smart will serve as the interim head
coach for tonight’s game against the  Milwaukee Bucks , President
of Basketball Operations Geoff Petrie said in a press release.  Under Westphal, the team had a 51-120 record in two-plus
seasons.  “I want to thank Paul for all of his effort on behalf of
the Kings,” Petrie said. “Unfortunately, the overall
performance level of the team has not approached what we felt
was reasonable to expect. I wish him the best in his future
endeavors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
