The yuan dropped after the central
bank lowered the daily  reference rate  by the most in more than
seven weeks amid concern the European debt crisis will cool
demand for Chinese goods.  The People’s Bank of  China  set the fixing 0.18 percent
weaker, the biggest reduction since Nov. 15, at 6.3115 per
dollar. Global economic growth prospects are dim and downside
risks are escalating, Zhu Min, deputy managing director at the
 International Monetary Fund , said at a conference in Singapore
today. France plans to sell as much as 8 billion euros ($10.3
billion) of bonds today as credit-rating companies threaten to
cut the nation’s AAA ranking.  “The lingering European debt crisis will harm China’s
exports and the central bank is taking account of this factor,”
said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based currency analyst at Bank of
East Asia Ltd. “Investors are buying the dollar as they become
more risk averse today.”  The yuan fell 0.11 percent to close at 6.3017 per dollar in
 Shanghai , the biggest one-day drop since Dec. 20, according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.2919
yesterday, the strongest level since the country unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993. The
currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent on either side of the
daily fixing.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan weakened 0.02
percent to 6.3125 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards dropped 0.19 percent to 6.3405. The contracts traded at
a 0.6 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
