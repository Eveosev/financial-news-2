A prison riot in the northern Mexican
state of Tamaulipas left 31 inmates dead and injured 13,
according to a  statement  from local authorities.  The riot broke out yesterday in a prison in the city of
Altamira after members of drug gangs began fighting over
territory within the compound, said a security official who
asked not to be cited because he wasn’t authorized to speak on
the record.  Police and army troops were sent in and restored order in
the prison, the person said. The fight was between members of
the Zetas criminal gang and the  Gulf Cartel , the person said.  Thirteen people were arrested after the incident, according
to the Tamaulipas government statement.  Tamaulipas, just south of  Texas  on Mexico’s Gulf coast, is
the home to the Zetas Cartel, which has been blamed for a series
of violent incidents including a casino fire in Monterrey last
August that left 52 dead. The Gulf Cartel is also based in
Tamaulipas.  The Zetas were formed by members of Mexico’s special forces
as the enforcement arm of the Gulf Cartel, according to
information on the  website  of the U.S. State Department.  About 43,000 people have been killed in drug-related
violence since President Felipe Calderon began his offensive
against drug trafficking organizations in 2006, according to an
Oct. 4 Drug Enforcement Administration report.  The Zetas are viewed as the “most brutal” of  Mexico ’s drug
gangs, according to a U.S. Senate report released in May 2011.
The Zetas and the Gulf Cartel are now fighting each other, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
