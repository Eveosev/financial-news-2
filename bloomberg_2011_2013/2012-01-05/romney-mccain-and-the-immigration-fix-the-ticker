NBC's  First Read  blog interviewed  Arizona  Senator  John McCain  yesterday after his endorsement of  Mitt Romney .  Here's what the blog reported: Trouble is, back when Romney thought Texas Governor Rick Perry was his biggest obstacle to the Republican nomination, Romney drew a hard line on illegal immigration, denouncing Perry's support of in-state tuition rates at state schools for illegal immigrants and opposing the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who enlist in the armed forces or attend college. Perry's soft touch on immigration set him apart from the Republican field -- and proved fatal. President  Barack Obama  gave Republicans a political opening to Hispanic voters by deporting one million illegal aliens, a record number and a source of enormous irritation to many Hispanics. For Republicans to exploit that opening, however, and fix their "problems" with Hispanics, the party must first fix its policies. There appears to be no appetite for that. As a result, the party continues to be overwhelmingly white in a nation that increasingly isn't. Republicans' limited outreach to minority voters, which was evident during the George W. Bush era, appears to have stopped altogether.Â  That leaves McCain, like every other political observer, with an eye on the demographic hour glass, wondering in which election -- 2012? 2016? 2020? -- the sand will run out on his party.
