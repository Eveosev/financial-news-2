Boeing Co. (BA)  reported an order from an
unidentified customer for 25 of the company’s 787 Dreamliner
jets, a boost for the composite-plastic plane after some buyers
scrapped planned purchases.  The purchase means that orders for the 787 were positive
for the year, following 32 cancellations for the plane recorded
earlier, according to figures posted today on the planemaker’s
website. The Dreamliner entered commercial service more than
three years late.  To contact the reporter on this story:
