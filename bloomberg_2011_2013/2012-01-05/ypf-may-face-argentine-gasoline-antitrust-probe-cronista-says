YPF SA may be investigated by
 Argentina â€™s national antitrust commission following a complaint
about its dominance in the local gasoline industry, El Cronista
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  Interior Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno yesterday gave
his approval for the antitrust commission to investigate an
accusation made against YPF in 2009 by the Federation of Fuel
Entities of Buenos Aires Province, the newspaper said.  The Argentine oil producer denies any wrongdoing, according
to the Buenos Aires-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
