Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, said it has resumed production at its Bonga
and EA fields in Nigeria while loadings of Bonny Light crude
will be delayed or canceled because of pipeline leaks.  The company restarted output at its 200,000 barrel-a-day
Bonga field Jan. 1 after it was shut Dec. 20 because of a leak
while a tanker was loading, The Hague-based Shell said today in
an e-mailed statement. The EA field was brought back online on
Dec. 27 after maintenance was completed.  Shell is continuing to investigate the Bonga leak and has
“isolated the faulty line” between the floating, production,
storage and offloading vessel involved and the export tanker,
Mutiu Sunmonu, its chairman in  Nigeria , said in the statement.
The cleanup of the “leak from the Bonga offshore oil field has
now been completed successfully,” Shell said.  The export line at the Bonga field leaked less than 40,000
barrels of oil, according to Shell estimates, making it
Nigeria’s worst offshore spill in more than a decade.  The company declared force majeure on Bonny Light oil
shipments today after it halted oil flows of 70,000 barrels a
day from the Nembe Creek Trunkline, which is connected to the
Bonny export terminal, on Dec. 24 due to leaks.  Exports of Bonga crude were originally planned at five 1
million-barrel cargoes each for December and January, according
to loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News. Nigeria planned
to export one shipment of 950,000 barrels of EA in December and
three for January, the plans showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
