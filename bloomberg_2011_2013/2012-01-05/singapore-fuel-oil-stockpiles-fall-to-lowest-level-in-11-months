Singapore â€™s  fuel oil  stockpiles
shrank to the lowest level in 11 months, data from the Ministry
of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of  residues (SPIVRESD) , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
dropped 4.7 percent to 16.22 million barrels in the week to Jan.
4,  International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the ministry,
said in an e-mailed statement today. Supplies are at the lowest
since Feb. 9.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates (SPIVMDIS)  such as gasoil and
kerosene, rose 7.6 percent to 10.01 million barrels.  Light
distillates (SPIVLDIS) , a category that includes naphtha, reformate and
gasoline, increased 5.7 percent to 10.72 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
