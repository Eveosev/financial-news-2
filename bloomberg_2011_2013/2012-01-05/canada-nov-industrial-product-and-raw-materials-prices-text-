The following is the text of
the industrial product and raw material prices report as
reported by  Statistics Canada .  Between October and November, the Industrial Product
Price Index (IPPI) increased slightly, by 0.2%, and the
Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) rose 3.8%, both led by
higher petroleum prices.  Prices for industrial goods increase slightly  Industrial Product Price Index, monthly change  The IPPI posted a slight increase in November,
following a 0.1% decline in October. The index's advance
was primarily a result of petroleum and coal products
(+1.1%) and, to a lesser extent, motor vehicles and other
transportation equipment (+0.3%).  The increase of petroleum and coal products in November
was mainly a result of  fuel oil  and other fuels (+5.5%)
and other petroleum and coal products (+1.9%). However,
gasoline prices were down 3.6%.  The November increase in prices for motor vehicles and
other transportation equipment was mainly attributed to a
0.6% decline in the value of the Canadian dollar relative
to the US dollar.  Some Canadian producers who export their products are
generally paid on the basis of prices set in US dollars.
Consequently, the depreciation of the Canadian dollar in
relation to the US dollar in November had the effect of
increasing the corresponding prices in Canadian dollars.
Without the impact of the exchange rate, the IPPI would
have remained unchanged instead of rising 0.2%.  The advance of the IPPI in November was moderated
slightly by eight product groups, including fruit,
vegetables and feeds; pulp and paper products; lumber and
other wood products; and primary metal products.  Primary metals (-0.1%) decreased for a third
consecutive month in November. Lower prices for iron and
steel (-1.5%), aluminum (-2.1%) and nickel (-4.8%)
resulted in part from weaker demand in  Asia  and  Europe .
However, these declines were offset by higher prices for
precious metals and copper.  Excluding petroleum and coal prices, the IPPI would
have risen 0.1% in November, following a 0.3% decrease in
October.  12-month change in the Industrial Product Price Index  The IPPI rose 4.2% in November compared with the same
month in 2010, a slowdown from the 5.4% growth observed in
September and 4.7% in October. In November, 18 of the 21
major commodity aggregations were up, 1 less than in
October.  Relative to November 2010, the IPPI was pushed upward
mainly by higher prices for petroleum and coal products
(+21.8%). More modest contributions were made by chemical
products (+6.7%), motor vehicles and other transportation
equipment (+1.5%), fruit, vegetables and feeds (+4.1%) and
meat, fish and dairy products (+3.5%).  Year over year, the increase in petroleum and coal
products was smaller than the 30.2% observed in September
and 25.2% in October.  If petroleum and coal prices were excluded, year over
year, the IPPI would have risen 2.1% in November. This was
comparable to the growth rate of 2.2% in October.  In November, the 1.3% year-over-year decline in the
value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar had
a positive effect on the advance of the IPPI. If the
exchange rate had been excluded, the IPPI would have
increased 3.9% instead of 4.2%.  Raw Materials  Price Index , monthly change  In November, the RMPI rose 3.8%, following a 1.0%
decline in October. It was led by higher prices for
mineral fuels (+8.2%) and non-ferrous metals (+0.9%).  Prices for raw materials increase  Among mineral fuels, crude oil increased 8.9%, while
declines were observed for coal (-1.4%) and natural gas 
(-0.6%).  In November, precious metals increased 5.6% and copper
concentrates rose 2.8%. However, the upward pressure was
moderated by nickel concentrates (-4.8%), other base
metals (-4.4%) and non-ferrous metal scrap (-2.4%), among
others.  RMPI growth in November was dampened by lower prices
for vegetable products (-2.5%), including rubber and
natural gums (-15.2%), corn (-5.9%) and soybeans (-3.9%).  Without mineral fuels, the RMPI would have posted a
0.3% decline in November, following decreases of 1.1% in
September and 2.7% in October.  12-month change in the Raw Materials Price Index  Compared with the same month in 2010, the RMPI rose
11.7% in November, which was comparable to the 11.4%
increase in October. The main factors in the year-over-
year increase in the RMPI in November were higher prices
for mineral fuels (+20.5%), animals and animal products
(+17.7%) and vegetable products (+6.7%). The advance was
moderated by non-ferrous metals (-5.3%), which had also
posted a decrease in October (-4.2%).  Year over year, if mineral fuels were excluded, the
RMPI would have risen 4.1% in November. It was the fifth
consecutive slowdown in the growth rate since the 19.4%
increase in June.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months
(for example, when the July index is released, the index
for the previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave
the plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer
pays. Unlike the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes
indirect taxes and all the costs that occur between the
time a good leaves the plant and the time the final user
takes possession of it, including transportation,
wholesale and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often
indicate their prices in foreign currencies, especially in
US dollars, which are then converted into Canadian
dollars. In particular, this is the case for motor
vehicles, pulp, paper and wood products. Therefore, a rise
or fall in the value of the Canadian dollar against its US
counterpart affects the IPPI. But the conversion into
Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents provide
their prices. Moreover, this is not a measure that takes
into account the full effect of exchange rates, since that
is a more difficult analytical task.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is
based on the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot
rate) established by the  Bank of Canada  and available on
CANSIM in table 176-0064 (series v37426). Monthly and
annual variations in the exchange rate, as described in
the text, are calculated according to the indirect
quotation of the exchange rate (for example, 
CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the
prices paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw
materials. Many of those prices are set on the world
market. However, as few prices are denominated in foreign
currencies, their conversion into Canadian dollars has
only a minor effect on the calculation of the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
