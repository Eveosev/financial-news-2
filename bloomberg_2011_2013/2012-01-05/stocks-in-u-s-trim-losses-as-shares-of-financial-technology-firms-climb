U.S. stocks pared losses as banks and
technology shares rose, helping the market recover from a larger
drop triggered by reduced profit forecasts at companies
including Target Corp. and J.C. Penney Co.  Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and SunTrust Banks
Inc. rose at least 1.5 percent after Deutsche Bank AG  said it
remained positive on banks and named the lenders as “top
picks.” LSI Corp. rallied 6.7 percent after the maker of chips
used in computer disk drives was raised to “outperform” from
“neutral” at Wedbush Securities.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,276.59 at 12:28 p.m. in  New York  after tumbling as
much as 0.9 percent.  Earlier losses also came as Eli Lilly & Co. and Tesoro
Corp. sank on forecasts that missed estimates and concern grew
that  Europe ’s debt crisis was worsening after French debt costs
rose at an auction, overshadowing data showing a strengthening
U.S. jobs market.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
