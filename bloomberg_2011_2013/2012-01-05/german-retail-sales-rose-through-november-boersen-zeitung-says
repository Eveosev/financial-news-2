German retail sales rose 2.8 percent
last year through November over the same period a year earlier,
setting a record, Boersen-Zeitung said in a preview of an
article to be published tomorrow, citing the federal office of
statistics.  Internet sales and mail orders contributed to the increase,
which was the biggest since 1994, the report said. When adjusted
for inflation, sales in the year ended in November rose 1.2
percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
