Orkla ASA (ORK)  Chief Executive Officer
Bjoern Wiggen said the solar-energy market slump and turmoil in
financial markets may delay the sale of its stake in  Renewable
Energy Corp. (REC)  ASA.  “Both are affecting REC and the solar companies so that
means that timing wise it’s a very difficult situation at the
moment,” Wiggen said in an interview today.  “We still have
the ambition to do something during this year but it has become
more difficult than you could have foreseen six months ago.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
