Boise State University  football coach
 Chris Petersen  is in line for a 21 percent pay rise to $2
million in 2012 after agreeing in principle to a five-year
contract extension.  The agreement, if approved by the state’s education board
next month, will run through Jan. 31, 2017. After this year,
Petersen’s pay will rise by $200,000 annually. Petersen’s old
contract called for him to be paid $1.65 million this year.  At .924 with a 73-6 record at Boise State, the 47-year-old
Petersen has the best winning percentage among active coaches in
the Football Bowl Subdivision. The Broncos went undefeated under
Petersen in 2006 and 2009 and beat Arizona State 56-24 in the
Maaco Bowl Dec. 22 after finishing No. 7 in the  final BCS poll .  Petersen joined Boise State as offensive coordinator in
2001 and became head coach in December 2006.  Petersen, who was also quarterbacks coach for the Broncos
before his promotion, was also an assistant at  Oregon , Portland
State and Pittsburgh since 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
