Diosdado Cabello, a close confidant
of  Venezuela ’s President  Hugo Chavez , will be sworn in today as
the president of the National Assembly, newspaper El Universal
reported today.  Cabello, the current president of Chavez’s PSUV political
party, will replace Fernando Soto Rojas at the head of the
legislature after pro-government lawmakers appointed him to the
position yesterday in a private meeting, the Caracas-based
newspaper said today, without saying where it obtained the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
