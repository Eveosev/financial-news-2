Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) , Ohio’s largest
lender, said fourth-quarter income was cut by $68 million before
taxes on costs from a bet tied to  Visa Inc. (V)   The bank’s liability on a swap contract related to Visa
Class B shares increased by $54 million after the card network
deposited $1.57 billion last month to an escrow account as it
prepared to resolve price-fixing accusations. Fifth Third’s own
litigation reserve is increasing by about $14 million, the
Cincinnati-based lender said today in a regulatory filing.  Fifth Third entered a swap contract as part of its 2009
sale of the Class B shares. The deal required the lender to make
payments to its counterparty because Visa’s deposit reduced the
value of the shares, according to the filing.  Editors: Dan Kraut, David Scheer  To contact the reporter on this story:
