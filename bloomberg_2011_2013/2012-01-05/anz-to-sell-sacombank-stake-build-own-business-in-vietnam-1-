Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ)  will sell its stake in  Vietnam ’s Saigon Thuong Tin
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank, known as Sacombank, as it seeks to
develop its ANZ-branded business in the country.  ANZ, which aims to get as much as 30 percent of its profit
from the Asia-Pacific area by 2017, has received approval to
sell its 9.6 percent stake to Vietnam Export-Import Commercial
Joint Stock Bank, known as Eximbank, the Melbourne-based lender
said in an e-mailed statement today. The banks plan to complete
the deal this month, ANZ said, without giving other details.  “Our ANZ business in Vietnam is now significantly larger
following local incorporation in 2008 and the purchase of the
Royal Bank of Scotland’s institutional business in Vietnam in
2009,” Alex Thursby, ANZ’s chief executive officer for Asia
Pacific,  Europe  and America, said in the statement.  Eximbank (EIB) , the third-largest lender on the Ho Chi Minh City
stock exchange by market value, will hold 9.73 percent of
Sacombank after the deal, Saigon Dau Tu Tai Chinh newspaper
reported earlier today, citing an interview with Sacombank Chief
Executive Officer Tran Xuan Huy.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
