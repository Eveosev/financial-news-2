Japan ’s competitiveness is being
eroded by an “excessively strong yen,” the chairman of the
nation’s biggest business lobby said.  Companies are finding it difficult to make capital
investments because of uncertainty over the European financial
markets,  Hiromasa Yonekura , chairman of Nippon Keidanren, told
reporters in Tokyo today.  Japanese companies expect the exchange rate to be between
75 to 80 yen to the dollar in the first half of 2012, said
Yasuchika Hasegawa, the head of second-largest business lobby
Keizai Doyukai, citing the results of a survey of managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
