Gold’s 11-year bull run will probably
persist for some time as the world faces global macroeconomic
headwinds, said Credit Suisse AG’s head of global commodities
research Ric Deverell. He spoke at the bank’s investor
conference in  Singapore  today.  On gold’s bull run:  “The main dynamic that has been driving gold in the past
couple of years has been a general fear of bad macro things
happening in the global economy. Whether it’s a reluctance to
hold fiat currencies, which I think is completely irrational.  ‘‘I can see how you can not like the  U.S. dollar , I can see
how you can not like the euro, but you can’t not like both of
them unless you think there’s going to be hyper inflation
because they’re just a relative store of value but people do
worry about these things for very legitimate reasons.  On gold’s drop from a record:  ‘‘The correction that we’ve seen in the past couple of
months is just that we got above that trend. So it’s probably
the one commodity that’s had a nice trend that ran too high as
people became very worried about  Europe  in particular and now
it’s come back to earth again. The underlying tendency to move
higher is still there at least for the next year or two.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
