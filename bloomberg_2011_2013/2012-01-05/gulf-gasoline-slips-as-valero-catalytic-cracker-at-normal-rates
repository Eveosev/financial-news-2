Gulf Coast gasoline weakened after
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  returned a fluid catalytic cracker in
Houston to planned rates.  The cracker was repaired after being shut Dec. 25 because
of a problem with a wet gas compressor,  Bill Day , a San Antonio-
based spokesman for the company, said in a Dec. 27 interview.
Day confirmed the unit reached normal levels today.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  widened 1.12 cents to 5.25 cents versus futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange in New York at 1:53
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 1.65 cents to $2.7275 a gallon.  Gasoline imports on the East Coast rose to 659,000 barrels
a day last week, the highest level since Dec. 9, according to
the Energy Department.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel in  Chicago (CHCGUTLS)  narrowed its discount
versus Nymex heating oil 5.5 cents to 13.5 cents a gallon.  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut a coker compressor at the Joliet refinery in
Illinois, resulting in emissions for 34 minutes yesterday,
according to a filing with the Illinois Emergency Management
Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
