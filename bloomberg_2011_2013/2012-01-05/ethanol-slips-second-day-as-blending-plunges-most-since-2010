Ethanol futures fell for a second day
in  Chicago  to the lowest level in more than a week as corn
declined and the government reported the biggest drop in
blending with motor fuel in a year.  Futures slid on speculation that rain in  South America  will
reduce demand for U.S. corn crops and temper production costs
for distilleries. The U.S. Energy Department said  conventional
gasoline blended with ethanol (DOETCWAT)  slipped 9 percent to 4.77 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since Feb. 11 and the steepest
decline since Dec. 31, 2010.  “That is an awful looking number,” said Matt Janney, a
trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “Wow, looks
like it fell off a cliff. It will be interesting to see if it
lasts.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 4.3 cents, or
1.9 percent, to settle at $2.185 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the steepest decline since Dec. 14. Futures have
fallen 5.2 percent in the past year. The contract expired today.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast and in
 New York  both sank 6.5 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.34 a gallon,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 5.5 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
$2.21 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive slid 2 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.355.  To contact the reporter on this story:
