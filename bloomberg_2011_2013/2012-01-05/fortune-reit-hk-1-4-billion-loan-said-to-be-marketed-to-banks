Fortune Real Estate Investment Trust (FRT) 
is marketing a HK$1.4 billion ($180 million) loan to about 30
banks in syndication, according to a person familiar with the
matter.  The loan pays an all-in fee, which includes margin and
fees, of 260 basis points over the  Hong Kong  interbank offered
rate for commitments of HK$250 million or more, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the details are private.  Fortune REIT, based in  Singapore , is a real estate
investment trust that manages a portfolio of shopping malls in
Hong Kong.  Banks joining with commitments of between HK$150 million
and $240 million get an all-in fee of 255 basis points. Lenders
joining with pledges of HK$100 million to HK$140 million get an
all-in rate of 250 basis points, the person said.  Fortune REIT hired  Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd., DBS Bank Ltd. and Standard Chartered Plc to arrange and
underwrite the three-year loan, said a person familiar with the
matter on Dec. 30.  The facility comprises a HK$1.1 billion term loan and a
HK$300 million revolving credit facility and pays a margin of
200 basis points over the Hong Kong interbank offered rate, said
the person who spoke in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
