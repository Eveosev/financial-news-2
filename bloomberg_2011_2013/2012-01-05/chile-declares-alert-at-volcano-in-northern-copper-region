Chile’s government declared a state
of alert following a series of tremors at the Lascar volcano in
the northern region of Antofagasta, home to some of the world’s
largest copper mines.  The government is asking local authorities to prepare for a
possible escalation in volcanic activity that could threaten
miners and residents, including tourists in the town of San
Pedro de Atacama, the emergency service known as Onemi said in a
 statement  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
