The  New York Yankees  were unable to
sign Japanese shortstop Hiroyuki Nakajima, after winning the
exclusive rights last month to negotiate with the infielder.  The Yankees failed to reach an agreement with Nakajima,
General Manager Brian Cashman said today in an e-mailed
statement. The team had a 30-day period to sign Nakajima to a
minor- or major-league contract.  Nakajima, 29, hit .297 last season for the Seibu Lions of
 Japan â€™s Pacific League. He had 16 home runs and drove in 100
runs. He will return to Japan and is eligible to become an
unrestricted free agent for the 2013 Major League Baseball
season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
