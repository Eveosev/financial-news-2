Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) ,  China ’s
biggest publicly traded steelmaker, kept February prices for
most products unchanged amid rising raw-material costs and
sluggish demand.  Prices of hot-rolled and cold-rolled products, zinc-
galvanized products, silicon steel and heavy plates were
unchanged from the January levels, according to a statement
posted on the company’s trade website.  Spot prices for iron ore  (TSIPIO62) arriving at China’s Tianjin port
gained 14 percent last year to $167.60 a metric ton on average,
according to the Steel Index, as rising competition squeezed the
profit margins of steelmakers. China’s passenger-car sales grew
0.3 percent in November, the slowest pace in six months,
lowering orders for products from Baoshan, which controls half
of the domestic market for auto steel.  Baoshan dropped 0.4 percent to close at 4.84 yuan today in
Shanghai trading, compared with a 1 percent drop in the
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. The stock has lost 25
percent in the past year.  The company raised cold-rolled coil prices on Dec. 12 for
January delivery, the first increase in three months.  Profit margins at 77 large and medium-sized Chinese
steelmakers narrowed to a record 0.43 percent in November
because of overcapacity and waning demand, the China Iron and
Steel Association said today on its  website .  China’s apparent steel consumption may rise 4 percent to
700 million tons this year, the association said today.
Production for last year was estimated to rise 9.2 percent to
683 million tons, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
