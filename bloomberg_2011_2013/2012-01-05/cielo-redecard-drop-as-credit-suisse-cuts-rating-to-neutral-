Cielo SA (CIEL3)  and  Redecard SA (RDCD3) , Brazil’s
largest card-payment processors by market value, headed to their
biggest drops in a month after Credit Suisse cut the stocks to
“neutral,” citing slower growth and more competition.  Cielo declined 2.3 percent to 47.58 reais at 12:31 p.m. in
Sao Paulo trading, while Redecard sank 3 percent to 28.61 reais.
Redecard’s loss was the second-biggest on the benchmark Bovespa
index, which retreated 1.1 percent.  The card-payment industry should expand 19 percent this
year, down from a previous estimate of 20 percent growth, after
a deceleration in the fourth quarter last year, Credit Suisse
Group AG analysts Victor Schabbel and  Marcelo Telles  wrote in a
report sent to clients today. Credit Suisse had rated the stocks
“outperform.”  New competition from Banco Santander Brasil SA will also
open the window for customers to renegotiate contracts, which
may lead to a drop in market share for Cielo and Redecard, the
analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
