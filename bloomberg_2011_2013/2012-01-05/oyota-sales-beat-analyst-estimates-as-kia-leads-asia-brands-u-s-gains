Toyota Motor Corp. (JDCSTYTA) ’s December sales
gain beat analysts’ estimates and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  had the
biggest increase among Asia-based brands, capping the U.S. auto
industry’s best year since 2008.  Sales rose 0.4 percent from a year earlier for Toyota,
compared with the average 1 percent drop of five estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Deliveries increased 43 percent for Kia,
13 percent for affiliate  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and 7.7 percent for
 Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , according to statements yesterday.  Honda Motor
Co. (7267)  reported a 19 percent drop, citing tight inventory.  Industrywide sales gained an estimated 8.7 percent as
consumer confidence reached an eight-month high in December, and
carmakers aired holiday ads and continued promotions begun in
November. Kia’s December surge in the U.S. gave the Seoul-based
company a 36 percent full-year increase, the largest for a major
automaker.  “Kia has even more potential this year,” said  Rebecca Lindland , a Norwalk, Connecticut-based analyst for IHS
Automotive. “Our forecast is for them to be up 23 percent.
Hyundai will be up by double digits again in 2012, but right now
everything new from Kia is selling really well.”  Vehicle Shortage  For all of 2011, the U.S. market share for Japanese and
South Korean automakers fell 2.6 percentage points from a year
earlier to 43.7 percent, according to Autodata Corp., a research
firm based in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. The share declined as
 Toyota (7203)  and Honda ran short of vehicles because of Japan’s March
earthquake and tsunami, as well as floods in Thailand late in
the year that limited parts supplies.  For December, their share was 43.6 percent, a drop from
46.5 percent a year earlier, Autodata said.  Industrywide light-vehicle sales in 2011 rose an estimated
10.3 percent to 12.8 million units, according to Autodata. Sales
figures weren’t available from all automakers.  Toyota gained 0.2 percent to 2,650 yen as of 10:02 a.m. in
Tokyo trading, Honda climbed 1.3 percent to 2,475 yen and Nissan
declined 1.1 percent to 691 yen. Hyundai rose 1.6 percent to
227,000 won in Seoul trading, and Kia slipped 0.2 percent to
68,600 won.  Toyota, Asia’s largest automaker, said December sales of
Toyota, Lexus and Scion models totaled 178,131. The gain was led
by the new Camry, which posted 33,506 in sales and was the best-
selling U.S. car for a 10th year in a row, said  Jim Lentz , the
Toyota City, Japan-based company’s U.S. sales chief.  Toyota ‘Momentum’  “With  consumer confidence  continuing to show significant
improvement, we believe this momentum will carry into 2012,” he
said on a conference call yesterday.  Toyota’s 2011 U.S. sales shrank 6.7 percent to 1.64 million
cars and light trucks. Its market share was 14.3 percent in
December and 12.9 percent for the year, according to Autodata.
The U.S. decline contributed to Toyota losing its top spot in
global annual vehicle sales to  General Motors Co. (GM)   Toyota will grow faster than the industry in the U.S. this
year, with sales of about 1.9 million vehicles for a 15 percent
increase from 2011, Lentz said.  That growth target won’t be easy to achieve, particularly
because of tougher competition for Camry among midsize sedans,
said  Jeremy Anwyl , vice chairman of Edmunds.com, an auto pricing
and data provider in  Santa Monica ,  California .  ‘Uphill Battle’  “Toyota is looking to regain some market share, but I
think that’s going to be an uphill battle,” he said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart.”  For Toyota and  Honda (7267) , “segments they used to dominate are
now incredibly competitive and that’s not going to change,”
Anwyl said.  Toyota’s Lexus, which lost its top ranking for luxury sales
in the U.S. in 2011, will be the fastest-growing in the category
this year, said  Mark Templin , the brand’s U.S. sales chief.  “We’ll have a huge volume swing especially because of the
launch of nine new vehicles,” Templin said on a conference
call. “It gives us a big push this year.”  Lexus sales will grow “well above 20 percent,” he said.  Honda sold 105,230 Honda and Acura vehicles last month and
1.15 million for the full year, down 6.8 percent from 2010. The
Tokyo-based automaker curtailed production at plants in  North
America  and  Japan  for months after the natural disaster in the
Asian nation.  “As we eagerly close one of the most challenging years
American Honda has weathered, we are well-positioned for a
strong 2012,”  John Mendel , executive vice president of the
company’s U.S. sales unit, said in a statement.  Honda Models  The company is counting on its revamped CR-V small
crossover and a redesigned Accord sedan and coupe due late in
the year to boost sales, he said.  Honda’s market share for the year fell to 9 percent from
10.6 percent in 2010, according to Autodata. Its December share
shrank to 8.5 percent, a drop of 2.8 percentage points.  Nissan sold 100,927 Nissan and Infiniti vehicles in
December. The Yokohama, Japan-based carmaker was able to avoid
significant production cuts in 2011, and boosted its annual U.S.
sales 15 percent to 1.04 million vehicles.  “We were very fortunate this year that we didn’t really
miss any production,”  Al Castignetti , vice president of U.S.
sales for Nissan North America, said in a telephone interview.
“We had the opportunity to pick up some market share.”  Nissan’s U.S. share rose 0.4 percentage point to 8.2
percent for the year, according to Autodata. Its December share
declined 0.1 point to 8.1 percent.  Altima Outsells Accord  The midsize Altima, Nissan’s highest-volume U.S. model, was
second among cars in the U.S. in annual sales, behind Toyota’s
Camry. The Altima outsold the Honda Accord for the first time.  “While Hyundai and Kia drew more attention last year,
Nissan was a company that has been one of the quiet achievers in
the market,” IHS Automotive’s Lindland said.  Hyundai, South Korea’s largest automaker, said U.S. sales
rose to 50,765 in December. For the year, the Seoul-based
company’s sales gained 20 percent to a record 645,691.  Kia, Hyundai’s affiliate, sold 43,390 cars and light trucks
in December, and a record 485,492 for the year.  Combined sales for Hyundai and Kia, which share engines,
platforms and a chairman, increased 25 percent in December, less
than a 27 percent average estimate of four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  For the year, combined sales at the carmakers, which
maintain separate U.S. operations, climbed 26 percent to 1.13
million vehicles, more than Nissan for the first time.  Japan’s  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  raised sales 4.1 percent last
month and 9.1 percent for the year. Subaru, the auto brand of
Toyota affiliate Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., reported gains of
26 percent in December and 1.2 percent for the year.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) ’s sales rose 0.4 percent for the
month and 42 percent in 2011, and  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  had a 3.1
percent decline in December and an 11 percent increase for the
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
