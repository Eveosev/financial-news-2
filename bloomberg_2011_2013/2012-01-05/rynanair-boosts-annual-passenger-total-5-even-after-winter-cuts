Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  attracted 5
percent more passengers last year even after  Europe ’s biggest
discount airline cut winter capacity for the first time.  Ryanair sold 76.4 million seats in 2011, the Dublin-based
carrier said today in a statement, versus 72.7 million the year
before, with the  load factor , a measure of occupancy levels,
unchanged at 82 percent. The increase would have been bigger had
2010 figures not included 1.45 million people who bought tickets
but couldn’t fly after a volcanic eruption closed airports.  Last month’s passenger total fell 5 percent to 4.8 million
as Ryanair grounded up to 80 jets, more than usual for winter.
The cuts, imposed as  oil prices  render some routes unprofitable,
have ended more than a decade of season-on-season expansion.
Occupancy levels still fell 1 percentage point to 79 percent.  Ryanair traded little changed at 3.68 euros as of 2:10 p.m.
in Dublin, giving it a market value of 5.39 billion euros ($6.9
billion), the highest among European airlines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
