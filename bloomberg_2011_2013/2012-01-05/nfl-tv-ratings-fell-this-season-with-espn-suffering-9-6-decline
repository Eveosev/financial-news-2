The  National Football League ’s
audience on major television networks shrank in the just-
concluded regular season after the sport signed new nine-year
broadcast agreements that will raise fees by 60 percent.  The overall audience for U.S. professional football fell
2.1 percent from a year earlier, according to Nielsen Co. data
supplied today by Horizon Media Inc.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN
averaged 13.3 million viewers, a 9.6 percent drop that’s the
biggest among the networks.  Sunday prime-time NFL games on  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC drew the
biggest audience with 21.5 million viewers, 1.5 percent fewer
than the previous season, Horizon said. News Corp.’s Fox
averaged 20.1 million viewers, little changed from last year’s
broadcast of National Football Conference match-ups.  CBS Corp. (CBS) ,
which airs smaller-market teams in the American Football
Conference, dropped 1.5 percent to average 18.4 million viewers.  Fox, CBS and NBC each renewed broadcast contracts with the
NFL through 2022, with fees rising 6 percent to 7 percent
annually, three people said last month. The league received
about $4 billion a year in TV rights fees from companies that
also include ESPN and DirecTV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
