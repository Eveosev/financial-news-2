Romanian state prosecutors are
investigating 40 officials at Romgaz SA, the national energy
regulator and the economy ministry over alleged criminal
activity,  Ziarul Financiar  reported, citing a prosecutors’
statement.  The activities may have caused about $126 million in
damage, the newspaper reported.  They include conspiracy and undermining the national
economy by selling natural gas to some private firms at below
regulated prices, damaging Romgaz and the state budget and
threatening the safety of  Romania ’s energy industry, the
Bucharest-based newspaper said.  The prosecutors haven’t identified any of the officials
being probed, ZF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
