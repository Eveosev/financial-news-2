Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  halted a clinical
trial of its antibiotic Doribax after more pneumonia patients
who took the product died and fewer were cured, regulators said.  Doribax, already approved for urinary and abdominal
infections in the U.S., is still considered safe and effective
for those uses, the  Food and Drug Administration  said today in a
 statement  on its website. The trial tested the drug in pneumonia
patients who were on ventilators, an indication for which it’s
approved in  Europe .  J&J, the world’s second-biggest seller of health-care
products, stopped the study of 274 people in May on the advice
of an independent monitoring committee, said Shaun Mickus, a
company spokesman. He declined to say why Doribax failed and
said the  New Brunswick , New Jersey-based company isn’t changing
its advice for doctors or patients.  “The bottom line is Doribax is safe and effective when
used according to its approved label,” Mickus said in a
telephone interview.  Patients receiving Doribax in the trial died 21.5 percent
of the time, compared with 14.8 percent for a control group
using different drugs, according to the FDA statement. Doribax
patients were cured of pneumonia between 45.6 and 49.1 percent
of the time, compared with 56.8 percent to 66.1 percent for the
control group, the agency said.  Johnson & Johnson doesn’t release sales figures for
Doribax, Mickus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
