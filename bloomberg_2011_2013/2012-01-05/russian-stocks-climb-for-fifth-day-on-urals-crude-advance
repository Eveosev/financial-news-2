Russian shares dropped for the first
time in five days as oil fell and concern deepened  Europe  will
struggle to contain its debt crisis.  The 30-stock  Micex (MICEX)  Index slipped 0.9 percent to 1,434.91 at
the close in Moscow, following a 4.7 percent rally in the
previous four sessions. OAO Rosneft and OAO Lukoil, Russia’s
biggest oil companies, both retreated. The dollar-denominated
RTS index lost 1.3 percent to 1,415.48.  Crude futures declined 0.8 percent to $102.40 a barrel in
 New York  after  Greece  said deeper income cuts are the only way
for the country to keep the euro, spreading concern about the
region’s debt crisis. France sold debt due 2021 at an average
yield of 3.29 percent, compared with a 3.18 percent yield at the
previous auction on Dec. 1.  Rosneft lost 1.4 percent to 218.89 rubles, and Lukoil fell
0.2 percent to 1,720.30 rubles. Regional oil producer OAO
Tatneft slipped 1.9 percent to 169.78 rubles.  Russia ’s markets are open during Russia’s new year holiday
through Jan. 10.  “The idea of holding trading during the holidays has fully
justified itself,” Roman Goryunov, first deputy head of the
Micex-RTS exchange, said in a statement yesterday.  The ruble weakened 0.8 percent to 32.02 per dollar and rose
0.7 percent to 40.9325 per euro, leaving it little changed at
36.0306 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  The  RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in
the index futures, dropped for the first time in three days,
falling 0.8 percent.  The Micex lost 17 percent in 2011 and trades at 5.5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. That compares
with an 18 percent slide last year for  Brazil ’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  index,
which trades at 9.3 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  trades at
8.7 times estimated earnings, and the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) 
has a ratio of 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
