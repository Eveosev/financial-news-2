 London . The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index (CMCIPI)  of 26 raw materials was
down 1.1 percent at 1,542.975.  CRUDE OIL  Oil extended declines after a U.S. government report showed
an unexpected increase in inventories.  Crude oil for February delivery fell $1.19, or 1.2 percent,
to $102.03 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Oil
traded at $102.69 before the release of the report at 11 a.m. in
 Washington , a day later than usual because of the New Year’s Day
holiday. It reached an intraday low of $101.95 after the report
was released.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures fell in New York after a government
report showed a smaller-than-average drop in U.S. stockpiles.  Natural gas for February delivery declined 5.5 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $3.041 per million British thermal units on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas has declined 32 percent from a

crude , amid ample storage stocks and low demand for the heating

dropped 0.15 pence to 52.85 pence a therm. That’s equal to $8.22
a million British thermal units. Power for the summer fell 30

months fell 0.9 percent to $7,472.75 a metric ton ($3.39 a
pound).  Lead, zinc, aluminum and nickel also fell in London. Tin

rally curbed demand for the metal as an alternative asset.  Gold futures for February delivery declined 0.3 percent to
$1,607.70 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the price
reached $1,626.80, the highest for a most-active contract since

$28.945 an ounce on the Comex. Yesterday, the metal slumped 1.6
percent.  CARBON  European Union carbon rebounded from a record low as crude

traded at 6.38 euros yesterday, the lowest since it started
trading in 2005, on concern that the market is oversupplied.  EU  Carbon Emissions : NI ECBMKT  SOFT COMMODITIES  Arabica-coffee futures fell the most in three weeks as wet
weather improved crop conditions in Brazil, the world’s largest

since Dec. 14. Before today, the price had slumped 27 percent
since touching a 14-year high on May 3.  Cocoa futures for March delivery dropped 1 percent to

rain in Argentina and  Brazil  will aid crops threatened by hot,
dry weather in the past month, cutting demand for supplies from
the U.S., the world’s top producer.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 1.4 percent to $6.4925
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. A close at the price

prices rose.  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.2 percent to
