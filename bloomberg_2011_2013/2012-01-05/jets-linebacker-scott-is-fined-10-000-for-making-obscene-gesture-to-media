The  New York Jets  fined linebacker
 Bart Scott  $10,000 for making an obscene gesture to a member of
the media, the National Football League team said in a
statement.  Scott declined to talk to reporters the day after the Jets
season-ending 19-17 loss to the  Miami Dolphins  that kept them
out of the postseason for the first time in three years.  As reporters gathered around his locker, he raised his
middle finger at a photographer and yelled to get the cameras
out of his face.  “Bart’s actions were inappropriate and unacceptable,” the
team said in the statement.  To contact the reporters for this story:
