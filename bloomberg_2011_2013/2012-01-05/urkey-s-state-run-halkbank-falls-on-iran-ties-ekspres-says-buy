(Corrects analyst employer in headline and fourth
paragraph.)  Turkey’s state-run  Turkiye Halk
Bankasi AS (HALKB) , which has an office in Tehran and handles oil
payments to Iran, dropped on concern that it might be affected
by additional sanctions on financial institutions dealing with
Tehran.  The shares fell 3 percent to 9.75 liras at 10:55 a.m.,
heading for their lowest since Nov. 24.  European Union foreign ministers aim to announce harsher
sanctions against Iran at their next meeting on Jan. 30, EU
spokesman  Michael Mann  told Bloomberg yesterday by telephone
from Brussels. U.S. President  Barack Obama  on Dec. 31 signed
into law measures that deny access to the U.S. financial system
to any foreign bank that conducts business with the Central Bank
of Iran.  “Halkbank only intermediates Turkey’s payments to Iran for
their oil imports,” Muge Dagistan, a bank analyst at Istanbul-
based brokerage BGC Partners, said in response to questions by
e-mail. “Halkbank is not doing anything illegal, thus the
weakness on the stock price should be deemed as a buying
opportunity.”  Turkey has a contract to purchase 9 million metric tons of
oil from Iran through its sole refiner  Tupras Turkiye Petrol
Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS) , the company said yesterday. Turkey is not aware
of any new sanctions that would affect those purchases, Energy
Minister  Taner Yildiz  said yesterday.  Tupras shares rose 0.3 percent to 38.80 liras, following a
6.5 percent plunge yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
