The lira weakened for a second day as
the central bank refrained from selling dollars on the market
for the first time in five days as reserves dropped to the
lowest level since October 2010.  Turkey ’s currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.8810 per
dollar at 5:30 p.m. in Istanbul.  Yields (TRABNBM)  on the two-year
benchmark note rose 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point,
to 11.59 percent, closing at its highest level since July 2009,
according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index.  The lira has gained 1.9 percent since the central bank
began selling dollars directly in the market on Dec. 30 and
withheld lira funding at the benchmark rate of 5.75 percent,
making the currency the best performer in emerging  Europe , the
 Middle East  and  Africa . Foreign-exchange  reserves (TURWL)  slid to $78.3
billion as of Dec. 30, equivalent to about five months of
imports, the central bank said today.  “We foresee that the central bank’s foreign-exchange
reserves will post further declines due to ongoing
interventions, daily foreign-exchange selling auction and
external debt repayments,”  Ozgur Altug , chief economist at BGC
Partners in Istanbul, said in a client note.  The Ankara-based bank sold between $200 and $250 million
yesterday on the market yesterday, Burcin Metin, chief currency
trader at ING Bank AS, said in e-mailed comments.  In today’s daily auction, the central bank sold $100
million today after receiving $864 million in bids. Bids totaled
$1.15 billion in yesterday’s sale of $100 million.  The central bank has intervened on the market to support
the lira after the currency fell to a record low of 1.9224
versus the dollar on Dec. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
