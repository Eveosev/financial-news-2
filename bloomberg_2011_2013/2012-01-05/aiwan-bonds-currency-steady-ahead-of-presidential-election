Taiwan ’s government bonds dropped and
onshore interest-rate swaps rose to the highest level in more
than a month on speculation the central bank will keep borrowing
costs unchanged. The local dollar gained.  The government reported toward the end of  currency trading 
that  consumer prices (TWCPIYOY)  rose 2.03 percent in December from a year
earlier, more than the 1.15 percent economists estimated in a
Bloomberg survey and November’s 1.01 percent pace. Policy makers
left the benchmark rate at 1.875 percent on Dec. 29 and said it
will continue to sell 364-day negotiable certificates of deposit
to drain excess funds from the financial system.  “Yields are following movements in interest-rate swaps,”
said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co.
in Taipei. “Some foreign funds are speculating that borrowing
costs of Taiwan and other Asian countries may converge as the
island keeps rates unchanged.”  The yield on the 1 percent bonds due January 2017 climbed
one basis point to 1 percent, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show. Wang forecasts  benchmark (GVTWTO5)  five-year rates will drop
as low as 0.95 percent in the first quarter.  The three-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive a floating payment, rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.913 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the highest rate since Nov. 30.  The island’s dollar appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$30.266
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  The  overnight money-market rate (NTON) , which measures interbank
funding availability, was steady at 0.402 percent, according to
a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
