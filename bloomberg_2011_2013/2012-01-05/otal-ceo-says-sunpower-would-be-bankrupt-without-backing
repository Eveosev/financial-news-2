Total SA (FP)  Chief Executive Officer
Christophe de Margerie said SunPower Corp. would be bankrupt
without the French oil company’s backing.  Speaking at an investment conference in Paris, de Margerie
said Total will “turn around” SunPower.  Total agreed last month to raise its stake in SunPower, the
second-largest U.S. solar-panel maker, to 66 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
