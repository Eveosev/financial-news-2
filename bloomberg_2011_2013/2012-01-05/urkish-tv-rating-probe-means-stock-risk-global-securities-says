Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL) , owner of
 Turkey ’s leading television channel Kanal D, may lose money amid
an industrywide investigation into TV ratings, according to
Global Securities in Istanbul.  Turkey’s organized crime directorate raided the offices of
TV rating companies and producers on Dec. 14 in an investigation
into practices adopted in the rating of television shows, which
play a key role in determining advertising rates.  “For 2012 we expect the holding will again generate losses
and the high debt of the company will prevent any new
investment,” Emre Yigit and Bertan Ilbak, analysts at Global
Securities, a provider of securities, corporate finance and fund
management services, said in a report. The irregularities under
investigation increase the risk to the company and “we expect
pressure on the share price to continue.”  Banu Camlitepe, director of  investor relations  at Dogan,
declined to comment on either the investigation or the Global
Securities report. Dogan’s Kanal D is the leading television
channel by viewership in Turkey, the Global Securities report
said citing AGB  Nielsen Media Research .  Turkey’s TV advertising market is estimated at 2.3 billion
liras ($1.2 billion) and any change in ratings of shows will
likely have a “material impact on broadcasters,” the report
said.  Dogan shares were unchanged at 51 kurus at the close of
trading in Istanbul. The shares have lost 72 percent in the past
12 months, compared with a 26 percent drop in the overall ISE
National 100 Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
