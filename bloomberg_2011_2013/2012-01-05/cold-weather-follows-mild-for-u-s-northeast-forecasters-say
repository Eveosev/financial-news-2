The U.S. Northeast, including  New
York , may have milder weather next week before a storm sends
temperatures down, forecasters said.  Average temperatures in the Northeast may be 3 to 7 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.7 to 3.9 Celsius) above normal from Jan. 10 to
Jan. 14, according to  MDA EarthSat Weather  in Gaithersburg,
Maryland.  By the end of that period, colder weather is expected to
take hold across the East after a storm system passes through,
according to the company’s 6- to 10-day forecast.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling.  Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri, predicts in its 6-
to 10-day forecast for Jan. 11 to Jan. 15 that average
temperatures will reach 6 to 10 degrees above normal across much
of the East Coast and Northeast.  Commodity Weather Group LLC’s president,  Matt Rogers , also
forecasts milder temperatures, in a range of 3 to 5 degrees
above normal.  Both MDA and Rogers, in Bethesda, Maryland, expect a storm
to pass over the East late next week.  The two forecasters also agree on their 11- to 15-day
outlooks for Jan. 15 to Jan. 19, calling for more seasonal
weather in the East with higher temperatures across Texas and
the lower Mississippi River Valley. Weather Derivatives doesn’t
do a 15-day outlook.  The normal average temperature in New York for Jan. 12 is
about 33 degrees, according to MDA. The average is 29 in Boston,
23 in  Chicago , 43 in Atlanta, 42 in Seattle, 53 in Houston, and
55 in  Burbank ,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
