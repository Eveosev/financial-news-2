Hedge funds  fell 4.9 percent last
year as global stock markets slumped amid fears that the
European sovereign-debt crisis would spread and managers
struggled with increased market volatility.  The Bloomberg aggregate hedge-fund  index (BBHFUNDS)  dropped 0.9
percent in December, with long-short equity and  multistrategy (BBHFMLTI) 
funds falling. Macro funds, which bet on global economic trends,
rose last month and declined in 2011.  “Managers are probably happy 2011 is behind them,” said
Emma Sugarman, global head of capital introduction at BNP
Paribas SA in  New York , which helps hedge funds meet clients.
“The notion of absolute return has changed. In the past, some
hedge funds were sold as absolute return, meaning they would
always generate a positive return, and clearly that has not been
possible.”  The MSCI All-Country World Index of  global stocks (MXWD)  declined
0.3 percent in December as European leaders struggled to contain
the region’s debt crisis, bringing yearly losses to 9.4 percent
and halting a two-year rally in equities. Stocks experienced
sharp price swings, beginning the year with a rally, rising to
almost a three-year high on May 2 and then falling 24 percent to
a yearly low on Oct. 4.  Multistrategy,  Macro (BBHFMCRO)   Multistrategy hedge funds fell 1.1 percent in December and
2.9 percent in 2011. Long-short equity funds, whose managers can
bet on rising and falling stocks, slumped 1.6 percent last month
and 6 percent last year. Macro funds increased 0.3 percent in
December and declined 6.5 percent in 2011.  Hedge funds dropped 4.7 percent in September, their worst
month last year, based on Bloomberg’s aggregate index. The main
Bloomberg hedge-fund index is weighted by market capitalization
and tracks 2,781 funds, 1,272 of which have reported returns for
December. The index is down 12 percent from its July 2007 peak.  Hedge funds, investment pools that can wager on or against
any asset, hold $1.97 trillion, according to Hedge Fund Research
Inc. in  Chicago . Investors put $8.7 billion of new money into
hedge funds in the third quarter, bringing deposits for the
first nine months to $70.1 billion, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
