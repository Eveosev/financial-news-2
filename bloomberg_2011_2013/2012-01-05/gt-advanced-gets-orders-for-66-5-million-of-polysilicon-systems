GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (GTAT) , a U.S.
supplier of solar manufacturing equipment, received two orders
for $66.5 million of systems to produce ingredients for
polysilicon amid a global glut of the main raw material in solar
cells.  SMP Ltd., a joint venture of  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) 
and Samsung Electronics Co., agreed to buy gear that produces
silane, Merrimack, New Hampshire-based GT said today in a
statement. A new customer that wasn’t identified will purchase
systems that make trichlorosilane.  Prices (SSPFPSNO)  for polysilicon fell 65 percent last year to $26.52
a kilogram at the end of December as production surged and
demand growth slowed for solar panels. Companies that replace
existing systems with new ones from GT Advanced can cut their
manufacturing costs to about $20 a kilogram, said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates Inc.  “It may seem counterintuitive that anyone would be adding
capacity right now, but these retrofits could be a viable
option,” Molchanov said today in a telephone interview. “Some
of the higher-cost players need to either exit the market or add
equipment capable of producing at a lower cost.”  The two orders have been included in GT Advanced’s backlog
for the third quarter of fiscal 2012, which ended Dec. 31.  GT Advanced rose 3.6 percent to $7.69 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
