The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars rose for a second day, according to a money-markets
indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was at 106.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 10:20 a.m.
in London, from 105 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The one-year basis swap was 91.5 basis points less than
Euribor, compared with minus 90 basis points yesterday. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banksâ€™ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps, held at 94 basis points. It had widened to 101 basis
points on Dec. 1, 2011, the biggest gap since January 2009.  Lenders reduced  overnight deposits (ECBLDEPO)  at the  European Central
Bank , placing 444 billion euros ($571 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday. Deposits had increased to a
record of 453 billion euros on Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
