Bon-Ton Stores Inc. (BONT) ’s bonds fell to
the lowest in more than two years as the department-store chain
cut its earnings forecast.  Bon-Ton’s $480 million of 10.25 percent notes due in March
2014 dropped 4.8 cents to 58 cents on the dollar at 8:30 a.m. in
New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The notes, which
now yield 41.2 percent, are trading at the lowest level since
August 2009.  The company reduced its estimate for earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to
$170 million to $175 million, the York, Pennsylvania-based
retailer said today in a statement. In November, it estimated
Ebitda would be $190 million to $210 million, according to a
statement that month.  Bon-Ton, which has stores in Northeastern and Midwestern
states, is trying to lure new customers with trendier clothes
and close its least profitable locations.  Its stock dropped 8.5 percent today to $2.90 at 11 a.m. in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
