U.S. stock futures fell, signaling
the market may snap a two-day gain, as concern about  Europe ’s
debt crisis and lower-than-estimated earnings forecasts at J.C.
Penney Co. and Tesoro Corp. overshadowed improving jobs data.  J.C. Penney tumbled 8.9 percent and Tesoro lost 7.5 percent
in pre-market trading.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March slipped 0.3 percent to 1,269.3 at 8:37 a.m. in  New York .  Futures pared losses earlier after ADP Employer Services
said payrolls increased by 325,000 last  month, topping the
median economist forecast for growth of 178,000 jobs.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased 15,000 in the
week ended Dec. 31 to 372,000, Labor Department figures showed
today. The median estimate of 38 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey forecast 375,000 claims. The average over the past four
weeks declined to the lowest level in more than three years.  The  S&P 500  lost 0.04 point to 1,257.6 in 2011, the
smallest annual change since 1947. The benchmark gauge for U.S.
equities surged 16 percent from last year’s lowest level on Oct.
3 as better-than-estimated economic data fueled optimism the
world’s largest economy can withstand Europe’s debt crisis.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rallied to the highest
level since July this week amid signs that manufacturing output
is increasing from China to Australia and America.  Figures from the Labor Department tomorrow may show the
economy generated 150,000 jobs in December after 120,000 the
prior month, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
 unemployment rate  rose to 8.7 percent after falling to 8.6
percent a month earlier, according to the forecasts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
