Fewer Americans filed claims for
 unemployment insurance  payments last week, showing the labor
market is starting 2012 on better footing than a year earlier.  Applications for  jobless benefits (INJCJC)  decreased 15,000 in the
week ended Dec. 31 to 372,000, Labor Department figures showed
today. The median estimate of 38 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey forecast 375,000 claims. The average over the past four
weeks declined to the lowest level in more than three years.  The decrease in firings indicates employers may be getting
more comfortable with their headcounts and their economic
outlooks as the year begins. Economists forecast a Labor
Department report tomorrow will show hiring picked up and
joblessness held below 9 percent in December.  “Claims are moving in the right direction,” said  Aneta
Markowska , a senior U.S. economist at  Societe Generale  in  New
York . “The labor market is pretty much treading water, but
it’s definitely not as far behind as last year.’  Companies added 325,000 workers in December, more than
forecast, adding to evidence the labor market was gaining
momentum heading into 2012, figures from the Roseland, New
Jersey-based ADP Employer Services also showed today.  The December ADP number may have reflected the so-called
purge effect. Workers, regardless of when they are dismissed or
quit, sometimes remain on company records until December, when
businesses update, or purge, their figures with ADP.  ‘Purge’ Effect  The paycheck processor estimates this change when adjusting
its data for seasonal variations and, because there were fewer
firings at the end of 2011 than in previous years, ADP may find
it more difficult to formulate a projection.  “There’s some possibility that today’s number has been
pushed up by that idiosyncratic feature of ADP data,”  Joel
Prakken , senior managing director at  Macroeconomic Advisers  LLC
in  St. Louis , said in a press conference after the report. “In
an improving labor market it can lead to an upward bias to
seasonal job gains.” Macroeconomic Advisers produces the
figures in conjunction with ADP.  Stock-index futures trimmed earlier losses after the
reports. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
maturing in March decreased 0.3 percent to 1,268.9 at 8:49 a.m.
in New York.  Survey Results  Claims estimates ranged from 365,000 to 390,000 in the
Bloomberg survey. The Labor Department initially reported the
prior week’s applications at 381,000.  A Labor Department official today said there were no
special issues affecting last week’s figures.  The less-volatile four-week  moving average (INJCJC4)  decreased to
373,250, the lowest since June 2008, from 376,500.  The number of people  continuing (INJCSP)  to collect jobless benefits
fell by 22,000 in the week ended Dec. 24 to 3.6 million. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments increased by about
5,400 to 3.5 million in the week ended Dec. 17.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, dropped to 2.8 percent in
the week ended Dec. 24, today’s report showed. Forty states and
territories reported an increase in claims, while 13 had a
decrease.  Claims, Payrolls  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  “Conditions in the labor market seemed to have improved
somewhat,” central bank policy makers noted in the minutes of
the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Dec. 13 gathering released
this week. “Initial claims for unemployment insurance moved
down, on net, since early November but were still at a level
consistent with only modest employment gains, and indicators of
job openings and businesses’ hiring plans were little changed.”  Employers probably increased payrolls by 150,000 workers in
December after adding 120,000 the prior month, according to the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
unemployment rate rose to 8.7 percent from 8.6 percent, the
lowest level since March 2009, the economists project.  Job cuts announced by U.S. employers rose in December from
a year earlier, according to another report today.  Planned
firings (CHALTOTL)  climbed 31 percent to 41,785 last month from 32,004 in
December 2010, which was the lowest monthly total in 10 years,
according to Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.  Government budget cuts and diminished business prospects
are still leading companies to trim head counts.  Boeing Co. (BA) 
announced yesterday it would close a facility in Wichita,
 Kansas , that employs more than 2,160 workers. Job cuts will
begin in the third quarter of 2012, the Chicago-based planemaker
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
