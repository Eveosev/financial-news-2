Bangladesh ’s central bank raised
 interest rates  for the second time in four months to curb
inflation that has exceeded 9 percent since the start of 2011.  Bangladesh Bank increased the repurchase rate to 7.75
percent from 7.25 percent, according to a statement in Dhaka
today. The reverse repurchase rate was increased to 5.75 percent
from 5.25 percent.  Bangladesh’s stance contrasts with emerging nations from
Turkey to Thailand that have lowered borrowing costs to protect
their economies from the fallout of  Europe ’s debt crisis. The
South Asian nation aims to control inflation to shield consumers
in a nation where the Asian Development Bank estimates more than
half of the 166 million people live on less than $1.25 a day.  “The central bank reset the policy rates higher to control
 money supply  in an effort to rein in inflation,” said Fahmida
Khatun, head of research at Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka.  Consumer  prices (BNINGENY)  rose 11.58 percent in November, compared
with an 11.42 percent gain in the previous month, according to
the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
