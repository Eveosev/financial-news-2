Since China’s so-called “one child” policy began in 1979, cheap, easy and anonymous  birth control  has been tantamount to a government-guaranteed right. Chinese pharmacies have long made birth control pills and emergency contraceptives -- also known as the “morning after pill" -- available without a prescription. But on Dec. 21, in a move that shocked Chinese citizens, the local  Food and Drug Administration  of Fuzhou, the capitol city of Fujian Province, abruptly issued an order requiring its pharmacies to acquire "real name registration" -- the names, phone numbers and government identification numbers -- of women seeking emergency contraceptives. By Jan.1 , this otherwise local issue had become that rarest of things in modern China: an open, national dialogue on a citizen's right to privacy. Emergency contraception is popular in  China . In  a  2009 online survey  conducted by the China Population Communication Center, nearly half of the 40,000 women questioned said they preferred emergency contraceptives to other forms of birth control. By far, the most popular form of emergency contraceptive is  levonorgestrel , a synthetic hormone designed to be taken in pill form within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The dose delays ovulation, prevents fertilization or prevents implantation of a fertilized egg. (In the U.S., the most popular brand name for levonorgestrel is  Plan B One-Step , available without prescription to women at least 17 years old.) If levonorgestrel was the only compound used as an emergency contraceptive in China, the city of Fuzhou may never have issued its now infamous order. But  mifepristone  -- a steroid best known in the West as RU-486 or the "abortion pill" -- is also available, in small doses, as an emergency contraceptive without a prescription. The problem, from the government’s point of view, is that women can technically buy enough doses of mifepristone to induce an abortion at home. Until recently, Chinese women had little reason to do such a thing. Abortion -- surgical and drug-induced-- is legal, widely available and socially acceptable in China. What is neither acceptable nor legal, however, is sex-selective abortion, that is, aborting an unborn female with the hope of later conceiving a male. Yet the practice is so common it produced a  gender ratio in 2010  of 118 boys to 100 girls in China; the  natural human ratio  is 105 to 100. New  genetic tests  allow expecting parents to determine the sex of a developing child as early as seven weeks into a pregnancy, the same period within which  mifeprestone  is designed to work. Wu Xingfa, the director of Fuzhou’s FDA, said  in an  interview  with Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, last week: Last August, China’s National Family Planning Commission, the People’s Liberation Army General Logistics Department and the Public Security Bureau, which is China’s chief law enforcement agency, launched a new campaign against non-medical sex determinations and sex-selective abortions.  According to Xinhua , the campaign, set to last until March 2012, seeks to “raise awareness of  gender equality , to severely punish those involved in cases of non-medical sex determinations and sex-selective abortions, and to strengthen monitoring.” Fuzhou’s regulation  requiring everyone to register who  purchases emergency contraceptives is seemingly in that spirit. But curiously, the  new rule  makes no distinction between mifeprestone and levonorgestrel, though the latter is for use only in the immediate days after sex, when even if a woman has conceived it would be impossible to know the sex of the developing baby. Thus, rather than inspire a conversation about sex-selective abortion and its deleterious effect on China's demographics, the Fuzhou rule has provoked a national discussion about the costs and benefits of a right to privacy. Many are questioning, with reasonable suspicion, what pharmacies -- and the Party -- will do with a register of people who have bought emergency contraceptives. Of the many newspaper commentaries on this issue, none was more eloquent or cited than the  Dec. 31 piece  by a columnist using the pseudonym "Si Yi," published in Gaungzhou's highly independent Southern Metropolis Daily: The essay connected the registration requirement for contraceptives to the  new requirement  that Chinese microbloggers register their real names with their microblogging accounts: On Sina Weibo, China’s leading microblog, Fuzhou’s regulation was one of the  top 20 trending topics  for almost two weeks, generating more than 3 million posts -- most of which were highly skeptical of the Fuzhou FDA’s competence. The novelist Wo Dan  tweeted : Many commentators and microbloggers argued that the policy will lead to a disastrous increase in surgical abortions as women,  especially minors, decline to  seek emergency contraceptives because they are too embarrassed to sign their names to a government register. “It will inevitably increase the unwanted pregnancy and abortion rates, harming the physical and mental health of teenagers,”  tweeted  Kong Xiangyi, a Beijing technology entrepreneur. Other netizens on Weibo argued that the registration requirement will create a black market for emergency contraceptives in Fuzhou. Xia Tian, a journalist with the Daily News in Shanghai, used his Sina Weibo account to  speculate , referring to a popular brand of levonorgestrel tablets: Far from dissuading other municipalities from enacting similar legislation, Fuzhou seems to have been a pioneer. Two other city governments in Fujian Province have recently introduced emergency contraception regulation, ensuring that women in that southern corner of China will have to work harder to protect their privacy from an overreaching government.
