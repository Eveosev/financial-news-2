Equities in  emerging markets  such as
China and Russia are attractive at current valuations, according
to Philip Poole, head of investment strategy at HSBC Global
Asset Management. He spoke on Bloomberg Television in  Hong Kong .  On emerging markets:  “Even though the fundamentals are still strong and the
growth prospects are so much better than Europe, they have sold
off in many cases more than the European market.  “For investors who can take a two-year horizon or longer,
we think the entry points in China, places like Russia in the
emerging equity markets are very interesting.  “Corporate fundamentals are strong and credit spreads have
widened. Some of the equities markets’ valuations look very
cheap on a price-to-book basis. In reality, the corporate sector
in much of the emerging world actually is in pretty decent
shape.”  On  Europe ’s debt crisis:  “It’s a 10-year problem. It’s not a two-quarter problem.
We still don’t see fully the route to a solution. There’s still
more work to be done, it’s going to take time, and in the
interim it’s going to be an overhang to the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
