German bonds rose as French borrowing
costs climbed at an auction, stocks declined and European
industrial orders increased less than analysts predicted,
fueling concern the debt crisis is feeding an economic slump.  Italian and Spanish bonds slid as  Europe ’s bailout fund
sells notes at a yield spread almost seven times its first issue
a year ago. Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said his nation
faces “the immediate risk” of a default in March if it fails
to receive more financing from international creditors.
Austria’s 10-year bonds declined as Hungary sold less than the
amount it planned to offer at an auction of 12-month bills.  “Within Europe, the issues are still ongoing and that’s
weighing on peripheral bond markets,” said Rasmus Rousing, a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.
“The debt issue is still an important risk for the economic
outlook.”  The 10-year bund yield fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.87 percent at 4:42 p.m.  London  time,
after earlier rising to 1.95 percent, the highest since Dec. 27.
The 2 percent security due January 2022 rose 0.50, or 5 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,281) face amount, to 101.18. Two-year yields
were one basis point lower at 0.17 percent.  French 10-year bond yields climbed four basis points to
3.36 percent. The 30-year yield advanced four basis points to
3.98 percent, after rising to more than 4 percent for the first
time since Dec. 1.  The euro extended its decline against the dollar after the
French sales, and was 1.2 percent weaker at $1.2787.  French Auction  France’s government sold 4.02 billion euros of benchmark
10-year bonds at an average yield of 3.29 percent, compared with
3.18 percent in an auction on Dec. 1. The 10-year bid-to-cover
ratio, or the number of bids received for each unit of debt
sold, fell to 1.64 from 3.05.  France  also sold securities
maturing in 2023, 2035 and 2041.  French bonds “are lagging bunds substantially,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at Monument Securities Ltd.
in London.  The extra yield investors demand to hold French 10-year
debt instead of bunds rose 10 basis points to 149 basis points.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  dropped 1 percent, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.6 percent.  EFSF Sale  The European Financial Stability Facility, which owes its
top credit ratings to guarantees from nations including France
and  Germany , will price its February 2015 notes to yield 40
basis points more than the benchmark swap rate today, a banker
involved in the deal said. That compares with the six basis-
point spread it paid to sell 5 billion euros of July 2016 bonds
on Jan. 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There are a lot of concerns about how the southern
European countries are going to refinance themselves,” said
Niels From, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “For
months to come, we are going to see a market that’s going to be
dominated by risk off.”  Volatility on Austrian sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by  Belgium , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps.  The Austrian 10-year yield rose for the fifth consecutive
day, climbing 11 basis points to 3.36 percent. That pushed the
extra yield that investors demand for holding the securities
instead of bunds to 150 basis points for the first time since
Nov. 28. Belgium’s 10-year yields advanced 20 basis points to
4.58 percent.  Hungarian Sale  The average yield at Hungary’s sale jumped to 9.96 percent
from 7.91 percent at the last sale of securities of the same
maturity on Dec. 22, according to auction results on the state
debt-management agency’s Bloomberg page. The government sold 35
billion forint ($140 million) of the debt, 10 billion forint
less than targeted.  “Austria is more exposed to eastern Europe then other core
countries so  Hungary ’s auction today won’t have helped its bonds
and is probably behind their underperformance,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed income analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd. in
London.  The European Union said today that aid talks with Hungary
won’t resume until the government proves that a new law doesn’t
infringe on the independence of its central bank. The EU and the
 International Monetary Fund  broke off negotiations on the aid
package last month after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  refused to
abandon the central-bank law, which came into force on Jan. 1 as
part of a new constitution.  Industrial Data  German bonds have lost 0.4 percent since the end of 2011,
after delivering the biggest annual returns since the financial
crisis of 2008, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch. The 10-year yield reached a record low 1.636
percent in September as the debt crisis threatened to infect the
euro area’s bigger economies and push the region into another
recession.  Industrial  orders (EUNGEZM)  in the 17-nation euro region rose 1.8
percent in October from September, when they dropped 7.8
percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today.  Economists (EUNGEZM)  had forecast orders to increase 2.5
percent, the median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Producer-price inflation (EUPPEMUY)  slowed to 5.3 percent in
November from 5.5 percent in the previous month, a separate
report showed.  Spanish 10-year bond yields jumped 20 basis points to 5.63
percent, after reaching 5.67 percent, the highest since Dec. 15.
Yields on similar-maturity Italian debt rose 15 basis points to
7.09 percent.  Spain  will auction securities maturing on July 30, 2015,
with a coupon of 4 percent next week, the  Economy Ministry  said
today on its website. It will also sell additional 3.25 percent
notes due April 2016 and 4.25 percent debt maturing in October
2016, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
