A meeting between Greece’s social
security minister and the  New Democracy  party failed to resolve
a disagreement over cuts to pension benefits, Athens News Agency
reported, citing the party’s representatives.  Labor and Social Security Minister George Koutroumanis said
that cuts to supplementary pensions should be agreed to before a
visit by representatives of the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  on Jan. 16, state-run ANA said.  Representatives of New Democracy, Greece’s second-biggest
party, said they oppose across-the-board cuts and a decision on
how to resolve the issue, which Koutroumanis says is a condition
for continued EU and IMF financial support, should come after
Jan. 16, ANA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
