Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd. (COOP) , the
East African nation’s fifth-biggest lender by market value, rose
the most in two months on speculation the stock was oversold
last year.  Shares in the company, also known as Co-op Bank, rose 2
percent to 12.85 shillings as of the 3 p.m. close in the
capital, Nairobi. The stock gained for a fourth day, the longest
winning streak since Dec. 21.  “It had fallen quite sharply at the end of December,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of investment company Rich
Management, said in a phone interview today from the Maasai
Mara, 186 kilometers (115 miles) south west of Nairobi. “It was
a very oversold share and it is now rebounding”.  Co-op Bank shares plunged 36 percent last year compared
with a  30 percent (NSEASI)  drop in the NSE All Share index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg news.  To contact the reporter on this story:
