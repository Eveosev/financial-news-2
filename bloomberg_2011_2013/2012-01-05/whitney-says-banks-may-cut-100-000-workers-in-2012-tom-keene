Meredith Whitney , chief executive
officer of Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC, said banks may
cut an additional 100,000 jobs worldwide this year.  Banks “roared by” predictions for 200,000 reductions in
2011, and this year “could be another 100,000,” Whitney said
today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with
 Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. This year “stands more of a chance
to be a repeat” of 2011, she said.  Financial firms worldwide last year announced more than
200,000 job cuts, up from about 58,000 in 2010 and 174,000 in
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
