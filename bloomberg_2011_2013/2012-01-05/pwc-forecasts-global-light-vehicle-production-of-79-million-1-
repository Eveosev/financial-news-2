Global light-vehicle production may
rise 6.8 percent to 79.1 million in 2012, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP said.  The figure includes production of 16.45 million for  China ,
an increase from 14.97 million in 2011, the statement said.
Output gains may be driven by easing inflation concerns in
 Brazil ,  India  and China, PwC said as part of a presentation in
 Detroit .  “Developed markets will basically be a wash,” Brandon
Mason, a PwC analyst told reporters. “The growth from 2011 to
2012 will be a result of growth in the  emerging markets .”  Polk, a research company based in Southfield,  Michigan ,
said Jan. 3 that global new-vehicle sales will rise 6.7 percent
to 77.7 million vehicles, helped by a 16 percent gain in China
to 17.9 million. China sales were unchanged at 15.5 million in
2011, Polk estimated, after the government phased out purchase
incentives. Polk’s estimate includes some light commercial
vehicles.  Initial sales forecasts for China, which call for 10
percent growth, may be optimistic, according to an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. Uncertainty in China, the world’s largest
vehicle market, and  Europe  may result in a sales range from a 3
percent increase in global volume to a 2 percent decline, the
Bloomberg Industries analysis shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
