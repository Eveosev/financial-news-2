British American Investment Co. (BRIT) , a
diversified financial services group, snapped two days of
decline as investors viewed losses as overdone.  The stock rose 5.9 percent to 5.4 shillings as of 11:41
a.m. in Nairobi, the capital. The shares retreated 8.1 percent
yesterday and are down 33 percent since the company listed in
September.  “It is rebounding after falling a lot yesterday and at
this point it is more of a penny stock, which will attract
speculative buyers when they sense an opportunity for price
gains,” Gregory Waweru, an analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel
Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
