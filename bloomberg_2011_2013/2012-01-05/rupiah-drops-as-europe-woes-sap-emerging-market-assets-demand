Indonesia ’s rupiah gained, reversing
its earlier decline, on speculation the central bank intervened
to curb losses in the currency. Bonds fell.  Bank Indonesia  is guarding the currency, according to
Bambang Eko Joewono, head of the global-markets division at PT
Bank UOB Indonesia. The rupiah dropped as much as 0.7 percent
earlier as the Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell on
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will sap demand for emerging-market
assets. The central bank sees room to reduce borrowing costs as
inflation eases, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said in
Singapore today. Bank Indonesia’s next policy meeting is Jan. 12.  “It is the euro-zone problem causing negative sentiment at
the moment,” Jakarta-based Joewono said. “With inflation
declining, a 25-basis point cut in the  interest rate  is
possible.”  The rupiah advanced 0.1 percent to 9,126 per dollar as of
4:05 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  Consumer prices in Indonesia rose 3.79 percent in December
from a year earlier after increasing 4.15 percent in November,
the Central Bureau of Statistics said on Jan. 2. The central
bank’s 2012 inflation target for prices to rise 3.5 percent to
5.5 percent will likely be met, Sarwono said today.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 8.25 percent notes
due July 2021 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point,
to 6.16 percent today, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
