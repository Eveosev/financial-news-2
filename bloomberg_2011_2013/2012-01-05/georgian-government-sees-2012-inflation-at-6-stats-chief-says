Georgia ’s government estimates the
year-end 2012 inflation rate will rise to 6 percent from 2
percent at the end of last year, said Zaza Chelidze, the head of
the  Statistics Office .  Inflation peaked at 14.3 percent last May, mainly because
of growing global food and transport prices, Chelidze said today
in an interview in the capital, Tbilisi.  “We knew that toward the end of 2011, inflation had to
slow,” he said. “As for 2012, the government estimates
inflation at 6 percent and I think that for a developing and
growing country like Georgia, this is pretty normal.”  The inflation rate was 11.2 percent at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
