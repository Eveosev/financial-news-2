Oil fell for the first day in three
in  New York  as concern that  Europe â€™s debt crisis is worsening
and threatening demand for crude countered speculation that
sanctions on  Iran  will curb supplies.  Futures for February delivery slid as much as 42 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $102.80 a barrel in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  and were at $102.86 at 2:45 p.m.
Sydney time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
