The Financial Times, owned by
education publisher  Pearson Plc (PSON) , acquired London-based web
developer Assanka Ltd., according to an internal memo.  “This acquisition supports our strategy to deliver our
world-class journalism anywhere, anytime on any device,
delivering new digital products and services that engage our
busy readers,” Chief Executive Officer John Ridding wrote in a
message to staff today. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  Assanka , founded in 2003 by Andrew Betts, 30, and
Robert Shilston, 28, developed an iPad application for the
Financial Times that allowed the newspaper to circumvent
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s approval process and retain all revenue from
its subscription price.  The Financial Times has more than 250,000 digital
subscribers and more than 1 million users of the FT Web App,
according to Ridding’s memo.  Assanka, which has 12 full-time employees, will become part
of the newspaper’s technology division and will develop software
across Pearson, Ridding said.  The software firm recorded a profit of 348,245 pounds
($560,000) in the fiscal year ended March 2011, according to
filings with  Companies House .  To contact the reporter on this story:
