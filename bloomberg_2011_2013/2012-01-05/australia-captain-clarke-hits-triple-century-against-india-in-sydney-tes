India trails  Australia  by 354 runs
with two days to go in the second cricket Test after captain
 Michael Clarke ’s record-setting triple century lifted the home
team to a first-innings lead of 468 in Sydney.  Fast bowler  Ben Hilfenhaus  removed  Virender Sehwag  and
 Rahul Dravid  either side of the tea break as the touring team
reached 114-2 in its second innings at stumps on day three.  Clarke was unbeaten on a career-best 329, the highest Test
score at the Sydney Cricket Ground, when he earlier declared on
659-4 at the halfway point of the five-day match. Australia is
seeking a 2-0 lead in the best-of-four series.  “It was really good to get as many runs as we did and to
come out and get a couple of very important wickets sets up the
Test match for a big day tomorrow,” Clarke, 30, said in a
televised interview with  Channel Nine .  Hilfenhaus put his team within eight wickets of the victory
by having Sehwag caught by a diving David Warner at point and
bowling Dravid with a delivery that sneaked through a gap
between bat and pad.  Gautam Gambhir will resume day four on 68, with Sachin Tendulkar 8 not out as he seeks an unprecedented 100th century
in international cricket. Tendulkar nearly played a Hilfenhaus
delivery onto his stumps when on 3, while Australia wicketkeeper
 Brad Haddin  let a catching chance off Gambhir go through his
gloves with the batsman on 66.  Partnerships  Clarke earlier paired with  Mike Hussey , who made 150 not
out, to lift Australia to its highest total since July 2009,
when it scored 674-6 declared against  England  in Cardiff, Wales.  Clarke’s 468-ball innings, which lasted 617 minutes and
included 39 fours and one six, was the  joint 14th -highest
individual total in 135 years of elite Tests. Former West Indies
batsman Brian Lara heads the list with 400 not out.  Clarke shared an unbroken 334-run partnership with Hussey
after also putting on a 288-run stand with  Ricky Ponting , who
made 134 yesterday to end his two-year century drought.  Hussey became the third straight Australian batsman to
reach triple figures in the match before lunch today, bringing
up his 16th Test century off 188 balls with a single. He added
another 50 runs to his tally before Clarke’s declaration.  “I thought it was the right time to get out and try to get
a couple of important wickets like we did this afternoon,”
Clarke said of his decision to end the innings. “The most
important thing for me is to win this Test and I think we’ve
given ourselves the best chance to do that.”  Triple Centurions  Clarke became the sixth Australian to hit a triple century
when he struck a boundary after the interval. Only Matthew Hayden with 380, and Don Bradman and  Mark Taylor  with 334, have
scored more runs for Australia in a Test innings.  “My goal today was to get past Ricky Ponting’s highest
score which is 257,” Clarke added. “Once I got that it was
then just about playing and trying to build some more runs and
more momentum for the team. Fortunately I got to 300.”  After resuming at his overnight score of 251, Clarke
bettered VVS Laxman’s 281 for the highest individual score in
Australia- India  Tests and also overtook Bradman’s 270 as the
best by an Australian captain in a home Test, a record that had
stood since 1936.  Clarke moved to 289 with his 34th boundary to pass the
previous highest individual score at the SCG of 287 by England’s
Reginald Foster in December 1903. The ground is hosting its
100th Test match this week.  Australia won the opening match in  Melbourne  by 122 runs to
end an eight-Test winless streak against India, which has never
won a series in Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
