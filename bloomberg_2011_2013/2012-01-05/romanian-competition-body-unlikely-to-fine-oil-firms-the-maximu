Romania ’s competition council is
unlikely to impose the maximum fine on any of the  oil companies 
under investigation for an alleged breach of antitrust rules,
said Bogdan Chiritoiu, who heads the regulator.  The probe involves companies such as  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) ,
Rompetrol Group NV and the Romanian unit of  Lukoil OAO (LKOD) , and the
maximum fine would be 10 percent of total sales.  The competition council will announce the result of the
inquiry and recommend sanctions at the start of next week,
Chiritoiu said during a conference in Bucharest today.  “Our report differentiates between the companies because
their facts are different,” he said. Under Romanian law, those
that initiated actions damaging to competition will get tougher
penalties, he added.  The companies are being probed in connection with the
withdrawal from the market of Eco-Premium, an unleaded gasoline
pre-mixed with lead substitute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
