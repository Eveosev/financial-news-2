Brazilian homebuilder  Tecnisa SA (TCSA3) 
dropped after saying contracted sales fell 46 percent in
December and it didn’t meet a target for new projects in 2011.  The stock fell 3.5 percent to 9.89 reais at 12:41 p.m. in
Sao Paulo trading, set for the lowest closing price since Dec.
28. The  BM&FBovespa Real Estate (IMOBBV)  index dropped 1.3 percent.  Tecnisa said in a regulatory filing yesterday that
contracted sales fell to 403.3 million reais ($219.9 million) in
December, which “surprised negatively,” according to analysts
from Credit Suisse. The company’s new projects in 2011 totaled
2.12 billion reais, bellow the 2.2 billion reais target, the
company said.  “Figures were weak,” Credit Suisse analysts including
Guilherme Rocha said in a note sent to clients today.
“Depending on the first-quarter sales performance, the company
may be forced to review its 2.8 billion real launches guidance
for the year, as it could add further pressure to its already
high inventories.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
