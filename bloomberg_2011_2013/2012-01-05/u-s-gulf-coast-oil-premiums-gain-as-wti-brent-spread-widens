Premiums for Gulf Coast crudes
strengthened as the spread between West Texas Intermediate, the
U.S. benchmark, and European counterpart Brent widened for the
sixth consecutive session.  The spread between the two crudes widened 53 cents to
$11.01 a barrel at 12:37 p.m.  New York  time. When Brent
increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur

European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI gained 15 cents to
$11.50 a barrel at 12:13 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  added $1.40 to
$12.25 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium increased 20 cents to $9. Mars
Blend added 30 cents to $8 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium widened
25 cents to $7 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  gained 25 cents to $6.75 over WTI.
 West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 35 cents to $1.95 a barrel.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  weakened 10 cents to a 60-cent discount compared
to WTI. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI widened by 15 cents
to $17.90 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
