Real-estate firm  Gagfah SA (GFJ)  and the
City of Dresden failed to reach an agreement during court-
ordered mediation,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing the court
and Gagfah.  The City of Dresden sued Gagfah for 1.08 billion euros
($1.4 billion), claiming the company broke a sales agreement,
while Gagfah countersued, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
