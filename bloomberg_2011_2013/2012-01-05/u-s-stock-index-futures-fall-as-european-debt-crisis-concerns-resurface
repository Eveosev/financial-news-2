Most U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (BKX)  higher for a third day, as a rally
by banks and improving jobs data offset reduced profit forecasts
at companies including  Target (TGT)  Corp. and J.C. Penney Co.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  rallied at least
1.2 percent after Deutsche Bank AG saw “encouraging signs” for
the industry’s fourth-quarter earnings.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
soared 8.6 percent amid speculation that the Obama
administration may introduce a nationwide loan refinancing
program. Target and J.C. Penney lost more than 2.6 percent.
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  slipped 1 percent as  oil prices  tumbled.  About three shares rose for every two that fell on U.S.
exchanges as of 4 p.m.  New York  time. The  S&P 500  climbed 0.3
percent to 1,281.06, after tumbling as much as 0.9 percent

to the obsession with Europe that we’ve seen all of last year,”
 Donald Selkin , the chief market strategist at National
Securities Corp. in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“People are seeing that our economy will definitely not fall
into the recession. Now you can see that there’s a separation
between what’s happening here, which is better, and Europe,
which is still projected to go into recession.”  The S&P 500 closed at a two-month high yesterday and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its  highest level (INDU)  since
July after gaining during the first two trading sessions of the
year on signs of manufacturing growth and improving sales at
carmakers and retailers.  Banks Rally  Financial shares rose the most among 10 S&P 500 groups
today, reversing earlier losses. The KBW Bank Index added 2.2
percent. JPMorgan increased 2.1 percent to $35.68, Citigroup
added 1.2 percent to $28.51, while  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  rallied
5.4 percent to $19.66.  Fourth-quarter earnings reports from the largest U.S. banks
should include some “encouraging signs” including accelerating
loan growth, higher mortgage revenues and improving credit,
Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O’Connor said in a note to clients.  Bank of America soared 8.6 percent, the most in the Dow and
the biggest advance since October, to $6.31. The shares tumbled

the Dow Jones Transportation Average slipped 0.2 percent.  Boeing
Co. (BA)  dropped 1.1 percent to $73.53.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  jumped 1.7
percent to $39.50.  Retail Sales  Target and J.C. Penney tumbled as  retailers (S5RETL)  announced mixed
December same-store sales results.  Gap Inc. (GPS) , Target and  Kohl’s
Corp. (KSS)  reported sales that trailed analysts’ estimates after
mistiming promotions or running out of inventory during a

Services said payrolls increased by 325,000 last month, topping
the median economist forecast for growth of 178,000 jobs.
Applications for  jobless benefits (INJCJC)  decreased 15,000 in the week
ended Dec. 31 to 372,000, Labor Department figures showed today.
The median estimate of 38 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast 375,000 claims. The data comes before tomorrow’s
payrolls report from the Labor Department.  “On the surface these are positive numbers ahead of
tomorrow’s jobs report,” James Gaul, a money manager at Boston
Advisors LLC in Boston, said in a telephone interview. His firm
oversees about $2 billion. “The market is trying very hard to
be constructive here,” he said. “Everything is still seen in
the context of whether the austerity measures taken in Europe
force a global recession that will impact U.S. businesses.”  French Debt  Global stocks fell earlier as France sold 7.96 billion
euros ($10.2 billion) of debt, with borrowing costs rising in
its first auction of the year. UniCredit SpA retreated for a
second day after Italy’s biggest bank yesterday announced plans

debt crisis, Chief Executive Officer Federico Ghizzoni told Il

maximum of 50 cents a share. Sales of its Nook Simple Touch
trailed its estimates during the holiday shopping season.  Beating Foreign Markets  U.S. stocks will return at least 10 percent in 2012,
beating foreign markets for a third year, while Treasury yields
climb, according to BlackRock Inc.’s  Bob Doll . The S&P 500 may
exceed 1,350 this year, he said at a BlackRock presentation in
New York today. The stock index ended 2011 at 1,257.60.  Health-care and energy stocks will perform better than
utilities and financials, he said. Doll expects dividends and
stock buybacks to rise by 20 percent or more this year.  “If companies continue to deliver -- and there are a lot
of reasons why they are -- stocks should continue to do well,”
Doll said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
