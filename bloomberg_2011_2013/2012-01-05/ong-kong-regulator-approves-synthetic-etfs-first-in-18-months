Hong Kong’s regulator approved six
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  synthetic exchange-traded funds, the first time
it has allowed such products since July 2010.  Synthetic ETFs are investments that mimic the behavior of
exchange-traded funds through the use of derivatives such as
swaps. The products, authorized on Dec. 30, are part of Deutsche
Bank’s  db X-trackers  series, according to the  Securities and
Futures Commission website .  The SFC’s approval comes more than three years after the
bankruptcy of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  Following that
insolvency, financial institutions in the city faced criticism
for selling investment products containing derivatives to
individual investors.  Ernest Kong, an SFC spokesman, said yesterday the synthetic
ETFs would have to receive Hong Kong stock exchange approval
before being traded.  The products “are listed, so the stock exchange is the
final regulator,” Kong said by telephone in  Hong Kong . “There
is still some work to be done with the exchange.”  Amy Chang, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for  Deutsche Bank (DBK) ,
declined to comment when contacted by telephone yesterday.  The last synthetic ETF the authority approved was iShares
Asia Trust, and the last it authorized for Deutsche Bank was in
March 2010, according to the regulator’s website.  The funds are the MSCI China TRN Index ETF, MSCI India TRN
Index ETF, MSCI Indonesia TRN Index ETF, MSCI Malaysia TRN Index
ETF and the MSCI Thailand TRN Index ETF. The other is the db x-
trackers II Australian Dollar Cash, according to the SFC
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
