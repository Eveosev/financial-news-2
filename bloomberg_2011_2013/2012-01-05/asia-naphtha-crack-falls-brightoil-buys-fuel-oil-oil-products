Asia naphtha’s premium to Brent
narrowed, signaling reduced profit from making the light
distillate. Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. bought fuel oil
for a second day in  Singapore .  Light Distillates  Japan  naphtha (NAPHJPNC)  swaps were at a premium of $83.80 a metric
ton to Brent crude futures at 3 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of
the profit from making the petrochemical and gasoline feedstock,
was at $84.52 at the end of Asian trading yesterday and has
narrowed about 8 percent so far this month.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the biggest buyer of  95-RON gasoline (MOGFC95S) 
in Singapore last month, purchased 50,000 barrels from
PetroChina Co. at $124.40 a barrel, based on a Bloomberg survey
of traders who monitored transactions on the Platts window.  Total SA bought 50,000 barrels of 97-RON grade from
Trafigura Beheer BV at a premium of $5.70 a barrel to  92-RON (MOGFC92S) 
prices, based on the survey. The Paris-based refiner also bought
50,000 barrels of 92-RON from Vitol at a 90-cent premium.  BP Plc sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON to PetroChina at
$121.20 a barrel.  Fuel Oil   Brightoil bought 22,000 tons of  380-centistoke (N6SHS380)  fuel oil
from PetroChina, paying $14 a ton over benchmark quotes to load
between Jan. 31 and Feb. 4, according to the Bloomberg survey.
That’s the highest premium since Dec. 7.  Hin Leong Trading Pte purchased 20,000 tons of the same
grade from Kuo Oil Ltd. at $9 a ton above first-half January
prices, the survey showed. The cargo is for Jan. 20 to Jan. 24,
the earliest loading period.  Fuel oil’s  discount (PVMPFD1M)  to Dubai crude widened 37 cents to
$3.04 a barrel at 2:13 p.m. Singapore time, based on data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The gap widened for a third
day, signaling refiners’ losses from turning oil into residual
products are growing.  The premium of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180)  fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade climbed 75 cents to $13.25 a ton, PVM said. This  viscosity
spread (PVMP13M1)  is the widest since Dec. 16, meaning bunker, or marine
fuel, advanced less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought 150,000 barrels of  gasoil (GASLSICF) , or diesel, with
0.5 percent sulfur from BP at 30 cents over benchmark quotes,
according to the Bloomberg survey. China International United
Petroleum & Chemical Corp., also known as Unipec, purchased
150,000 barrels from Shell at a 60-cent premium.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 34 cents
to $18.68 a barrel at 2:13 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
This  crack spread (PVMPGDM1)  widened for a third day, the longest rising
streak since October.  Jet fuel (JETKSIFC) ’s premium to gasoil fell 5 cents to 20 cents a
barrel, the lowest so far this week, PVM said. A narrower
 regrade (PVMPJG1M)  indicates it is less profitable to produce  aviation fuel 
over diesel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
