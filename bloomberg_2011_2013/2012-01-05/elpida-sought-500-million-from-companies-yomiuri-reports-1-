Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , the Japanese
chipmaker being reorganized with government support, has sought
$500 million from 10 companies in the U.S., Taiwan and  China  as
it faces about 122 billion ($1.6 billion) in debt due by April,
the Yomiuri newspaper reported.  The chipmaker declined to comment on the newspaper report
today in an e-mail. The Tokyo-based company also may ask  Toshiba
Corp. (6502)  for help, the newspaper reported without saying where it
got the information.  Elpida dropped in Tokyo trading today, a day after having
its biggest gain in six weeks following a Jan. 3 Digitimes
report that the company is in talks to integrate operations with
Toshiba,  Japan ’s biggest semiconductor producer. Elpida and
rival makers of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, lost a
combined $14 billion in the past three years as prices plunged
and demand shifted toward smartphones and tablets that use flash
memory chips, including those made by Toshiba.  “If Elpida becomes more competitive through structural
reforms and rationalization, we might be able to help with our
processing technology,” Norio Sasaki, Toshiba’s president, said
today at a New Year’s party for a Japanese business association
in  Tokyo . “We are not in such a situation yet.”  Japan’s government may push for integration between
chipmaking operations at Elpida and Toshiba to improve
competitiveness against South Korean rivals, DigiTimes reported
Jan. 3, citing industry officials it didn’t identify.  Elpida slumped 7.4 percent to 350 yen at the 3 p.m. close
of Tokyo trading, bringing its decline in the past 12 months to
66 percent, compared with an 18 percent drop for the Nikkei 225
Stock Average.  The chipmaker received 30 billion yen in fiscal year 2009
through the state-run  Development Bank  of Japan Inc., in
addition to 100 billion yen in loans from banks to help pay for
restructuring. Spot prices for benchmark DDR3 2-gigabit DRAM
fell 47 percent in the past 12 months to 97 cents as of today,
according to data from Taipei-based Dramexchange Technology Inc.
　　“Chipmakers require huge  capital investment  to remain
competitive and the amounts being discussed may not be enough
for Elpida to do that,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees
about $600 million at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in
Tokyo.  Elpida’s net loss probably will amount to 95 billion yen
for the year ending March 31, according to the average of 18
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company had losses totaling about 287 billion yen
during the past 10 fiscal years, compared with net income of
about 66 billion yen in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
