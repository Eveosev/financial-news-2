AlertMe.com Ltd ., a U.K. provider of
home energy management devices, said it signed an agreement to
distribute its products through  Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the world’s second-
biggest home improvement chain.  The Cambridge-based company, which is backed by venture
capital investors such as Good Energies Inc. and VantagePoint
Capital Partners, said the service will allow home owners to
control thermostats, lights, door locks and motion sensors from
smartphones and remote computers.  Lowe’s has 15 million shoppers a week at its 1,750 stores
across the U.S. The new service will be part of Lowe’s own Iris
home management system that will start between April and June.
Alertme said it wants to expand into systems that monitor
gardens, appliances and vehicles.  “The smart home will be the next major consumer technology
innovation space and it is just about to become an affordable,
mass market proposition for everyone,” AlertMe Chief Executive
Officer Mary Turner said in the statement. “The entrance of a
giant retail brand like Lowe’s means we are poised to bring the
smart home into the mainstream and not just for the more
affluent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
