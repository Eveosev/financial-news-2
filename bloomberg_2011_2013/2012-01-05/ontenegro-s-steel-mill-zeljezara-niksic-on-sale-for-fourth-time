Zeljezara AD Niksic (ZEHK) , a Montenegrin 
steel mill, was offered for sale today by its receivership
administrator with an asking price of 30 million euros ($38.4
million).  The court-appointed administration invited offers in an
advertisement in the  Pobjeda  newspaper, asking potential buyers
to submit bids by Feb. 5, and make a mandatory deposit of 10
percent of the starting price first. The steelworks was put into
bankruptcy on April 15 by a workers union that demanded overdue
monthly wages.  This is the fourth time that Zeljezara is being offered to
buyers since Montenegro began asset sales almost two decades
ago. In August, Zeljezara’s main creditors, including
Netherlands-based MNSS BV, secured a U.K. court judgment backing
their efforts to recover claims of estimated 60 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
