San Antonio Spurs guard Manu Ginobili
will undergo surgery today to repair a fracture in his left hand,
the National Basketball Association team said on its website.  Ginobili, 34, broke the bone below his little finger during
the second quarter of the Spurs’ 106-96 loss to the  Minnesota
Timberwolves  on Jan. 2.  “I’ll have a plate and screws on my beloved left hand,”
Ginobili said yesterday on his Twitter site. “Not thrilled.”  The team said there is no timeline for his return. He may
be out at least two months, the  Associated Press  reported.  Ginobili is averaging 17.4 points per game this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
