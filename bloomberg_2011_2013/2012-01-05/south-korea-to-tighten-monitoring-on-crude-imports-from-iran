South Korea ’s government is closely
monitoring crude imports from  Iran  amid concern that new U.S.
sanctions against the Middle East country may cause a surge in
global and local oil prices.  South  Korea  will reinforce diplomatic efforts to minimize a
reduction of crude purchases from Iran, and plans to look for
alternative suppliers to secure a stable supply of oil,
according to a joint statement from the finance, energy and
other ministries.  Iran is South Korea’s fifth-largest  supplier (SKIMCRIR)  of crude, and
accounted for 9.4 percent of its overall imports in 2011,
according to the statement. The nation depends entirely on
overseas purchases for oil.  “We are already participating in sanctions” concerning
the purchase of petrochemical products, South Korean foreign
minister Kim Sung Hwan told reporters in  Seoul . Asked for
Korea’s response to the European Union’s steps toward halting
oil purchases from Iran, he said the government is “consulting
with related ministries” to map out measures concerning crude
imports.  South Korea announced Dec. 16 that it will expand sanctions
against Iran and cautioned companies against importing
petrochemicals. Crude oil shipments are not affected by the Dec.
16 curbs on transactions with Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
