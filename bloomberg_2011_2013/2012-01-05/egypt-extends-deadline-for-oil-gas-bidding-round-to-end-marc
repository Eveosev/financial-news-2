Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. said
its international oil and natural-gas bidding round closing date
was extended by two months until the end of March after
potential bidders requested more time for evaluation.  The tender drew interest from new foreign companies that
want to start work in  Egypt  as well as from companies already
operating in the North African country, said Adel Kamel, the
company’s deputy chief executive officer for agreements.  “The deadline was extended on request of the companies as
they need more time to evaluate the blocks,” Kamel said by
telephone from Cairo.  The state-run company invited bids in September for 15
onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration concessions in the
first such move since July 2009. The bid round is part of an
effort by the Egyptian government to attract foreign investment
needed to boost the economy after a popular uprising toppled
then-President  Hosni Mubarak  in February. Egypt holds  Africa ’s
sixth-largest oil reserves, with 4.5 billion barrels, and the
continent’s third-biggest gas reserves, with 78 trillion cubic
feet, according to data from BP Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
