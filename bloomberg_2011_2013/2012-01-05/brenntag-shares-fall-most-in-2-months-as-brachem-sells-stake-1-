Brenntag AG (BNR)  dropped the most in
almost two months in  Frankfurt  trading after a group of private
equity investors sold an 8.7 percent stake in the German
chemical distributor for about 315 million euros ($407 million).  Brenntag fell as much as 3.3 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since Nov. 10, to 69.88 euros. Brachem, majority owned
by  BC Partners  Ltd., sold the shares at 70 euros each to
institutional investors, the  investment company  said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Brenntag, which sold shares to the public in March 2010,
now has 72 percent of its stock freely traded. The higher free-
float is unlikely to make the Muelheim-based company a takeover
target as there is no obvious buyer, said Jesko Mayer-Wegelin, a
Dusseldorf-based analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG.  “Not a lot can happen with the big chemical distribution
companies because of cartel issues,” said Mayer-Wegelin, who
has an “overweight” rating on the stock. “Private equity is a
bit reticent at the moment and it doesn’t make a lot of sense
for chemical producers” to buy the company.  Brenntag was trading down 2.6 percent at 70.40 euros as of
11:22 a.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has declined 12 percent in
the last six months, giving the company a market value of 3.63
billion euros.  Brachem, which agreed not to sell any more shares for 90
days, has reduced its stake in the chemical distributor in
several tranches. The investment company, which still holds 27
percent of Brenntag, sold 7 million of the company’s shares last
January and 11 million shares in October 2010.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  managed the sale, Brachem said.
Funds advised by BC Partners,  Bain Capital  and Goldman Sachs
have combined their stakes in Brachem.  BC Partners bought the business in 2006 for about 3 billion
euros, including debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
