President  James Bullard  said that policy makers at the central
bank may be nearing consensus about clearly stating their goals
for the rate of inflation.  “I think we’re very close to having inflation targeting in
the U.S.,” Bullard said in a Bloomberg Radio interview today.
“This may be the opportunity to get something done that
everyone on the committee can rally around.”  “I think it would come in the form of some kind of
statement from the committee that would name a target but would
also reiterate some of the things we’ve said over the years
about how keeping inflation low and stable contributes to great
economic performance overall,” said Bullard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
