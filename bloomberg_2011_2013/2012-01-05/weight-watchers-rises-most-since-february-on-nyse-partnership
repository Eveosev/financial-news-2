Weight Watchers International Inc. (WTW) 
rose the most in more than seven months after announcing
partnerships with  American Express Co. (AXP)  and  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  to
provide health programs to employees.  The company increased 8.4 percent to $62.52 at the close in
New York, the biggest gain since May 9. The shares advanced as
much as 7.5 percent yesterday after Weight Watchers announced
the agreements Jan. 3.  American Express, based in New York, will pay 100 percent
of the cost to its employees for as long as one year for Weight
Watchers meetings, while New York-based NYSE will cover half of
the costs, Weight Watchers said in a statement.  Partnering with companies saves overhead costs for meetings
and likely encourages clients to “stick around longer” because
their employer is paying, Kurt Frederick, an analyst at Wedbush
Securities Inc. in  San Francisco , said in a telephone interview.  “The benefit to Weight Watchers is they have to do less
marketing,” said Frederick, who rates the shares
“outperform.”  The New York-based weight-management company has recently
sought to draw more customers by advertising to men and using
celebrities, including  Charles Barkley  and Jennifer Hudson, in
commercials.  “Health-care costs are continuing to spiral out of
control,” Weight Watchers Chief Executive Officer David Kirchhoff told Bloomberg News on Jan. 3. Companies see Weight
Watchers as “a really effective, low-cost and scalable tool
that they can employ today,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
