Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) , Nigeria’s
largest lender by market value, and  First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) 
gained as  Standard & Poor’s  raised its outlook on the companies
to positive following a similar upgrade on government debt.  Guaranty advanced for the first time in three days, adding
1.4 percent to 14.2 naira at the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. First
Bank, the third biggest, rose 2.3 percent to 9 naira. The
outlooks were increased from stable.  S&P raised its outlook on the government’s credit rating
Dec. 29 and indicated it may upgrade Africa’s largest oil
producer from B+, the fourth-highest non-investment grade
status, if the government follows through with plans to boost
the economy and savings. President Goodluck Jonathan has
scrapped fuel subsidies, pledged to invest more in  power plants 
and create a sovereign wealth fund to bolster sub-Saharan
Africa’s second-largest economy, while the central bank has
bailed out banks to stabilize the industry.  The outlooks “reflect the banks’ stand-alone credit
profiles and the outlook on the sovereign, and indicate at least
a one-in-three likelihood of the banks being upgraded if the
government’s reform initiatives progress and help support
economic growth,” the New-York based ratings company said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
