Bulgaria  wants to increase the output
capacity of its 2,000-megawatt Kozloduy plant on the Danube by
120 megawatts.  The plant has notified the  Nuclear Regulatory Agency  in
Sofia about its plans to raise its capacity, which will require
a licensing change, Sergei Tsochev, the regulator’s president,
told reporters in Sofia today. The agency will be able to issue
the new license by the end of 2013 if Kozloduy supplies all the
necessary documents in time, he said.  The Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant AD will also need to
request approval to extend the operational life of its two
reactors four years before they are due to expire in 2017 and
2019, Tsochev said. Bulgaria will seek to extend the two
Russian-made units’ operation by 10 years, Prime Minister  Boiko
Borissov  said in June.  “To allow a service life extension we need to examine the
aging of the reactors and to have part of the equipment
replaced,” Tsochev said.  Kozloduy, which supplies some 40 percent of Bulgaria’s
electricity, passed stress tests examining its resistance to
earthquakes, floods, extreme temperatures and other natural
disasters, the regulator said earlier today.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
