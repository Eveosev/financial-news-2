Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) , a British inter-
dealer broker, said 2011 revenue was probably in line with that
of a year earlier amid periods of high market volatility.  Revenue, using a constant  exchange rate  and adjusting for
the impact of the closing of the company’s satellite offices in
 North America  and for the acquisition of Convencao, probably
increased by about 2 percent from 905.5 million pounds ($1.4
billion) in 2010, the London-based firm said in a statement
today.  “There have been periods of market volatility and
heightened activity, although there have also been periods of
more subdued activity,” the company said in the statement. “In
light of the market conditions, a number of actions were taken
prior to the year end to reduce costs and to maintain
flexibility in the cost base.”  Tullett will post a 10 million-pound charge reflecting
cost-cutting actions and will take more such measures in the
first half of 2012, it said today.  Inter-dealer brokers such as Tullett act as a go-between
for banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives. They typically handle more trades between banks
during periods of greater market volatility.  Tullett, which split off from U.K. stockbroker  Collins
Stewart  in 2006, said last month that Chief Operating Officer
Steph Duckworth resigned after 17 years with the firm. No reason
was given for his departure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
