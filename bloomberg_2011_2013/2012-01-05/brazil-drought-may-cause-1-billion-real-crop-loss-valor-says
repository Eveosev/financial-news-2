Corn plantations and other crops in
 Brazil ’s southernmost Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina
states may lose 1 billion reais ($546 million) worth of
production because of a drought,  Valor Economico  reported.  Corn and bean crops have been harmed the most by the lack
of rain, while soybean output hasn’t been affected yet, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said, citing reports from the governments
of the two states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
