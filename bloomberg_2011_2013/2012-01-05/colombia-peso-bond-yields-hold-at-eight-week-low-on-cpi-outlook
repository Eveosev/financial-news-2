Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds held
at an eight-week low as speculation a report today will show
inflation slowed in December bolstered appetite for fixed-rate
securities.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
was little changed at 7.53 percent at 9:30 a.m. in Bogota,
according to the stock exchange. The yield on the peso bonds,
known as TES, has fallen 11 basis points this year.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.6 percent in December from
3.96 percent in November, according to the median estimate of 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The national statistics agency
is slated to release the report at 7 p.m. Bogota time.  “Inflation is going to surprise on the low side,” said
 Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, Colombia’s
second-biggest bank. “Good times are coming for TES as
investors price in positive fiscal results and lower
inflation.”  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said Dec. 20 that
the government plans to raise 18.4 trillion pesos ($9.7 billion)
of bonds in the local market this year, less than the 20
trillion pesos originally planned. He also announced the
consolidated  budget deficit , which includes states,
municipalities and state-run companies, should fall to 1.8
percent of gross domestic product this year from a projected 2.9
percent of GDP in 2011.  The peso fell for the first day in six, weakening 0.2
percent to 1,888.74 per  U.S. dollar , from 1,885.75 yesterday. It
has jumped 2.6 percent this year, the best performance among the
six most-traded currencies in  Latin America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
