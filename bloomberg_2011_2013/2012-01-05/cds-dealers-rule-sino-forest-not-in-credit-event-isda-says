Dealers and investors ruled that a
bankruptcy  credit event  that would trigger default swaps on
 Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) ’s debt hasn’t occurred, the International
Swaps & Derivatives Association said on its  website .  ISDA’s determinations committee for  Asia  excluding  Japan 
previously declined a Dec. 19 request to decide whether a so-
called failure-to-pay credit event occurred, ISDA said.  Sino-Forest received notices of default on Dec. 16 on
senior notes due 2014 and 2017 after failing to publish its
third-quarter financial results in a “timely manner,”
according to a statement from the company two days later.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
