Service industries  in the U.S.
expanded less than forecast in December, indicating improvement
in the economy will be uneven.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  index (NAPMNMI)  of non-
manufacturing industries, which account for almost 90 percent of
the economy, rose to 52.6 last month from 52 in November, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an increase to
53. Fifty is the dividing line between expansion and
contraction.  Slow wage growth, limited job gains and depressed real
estate values may make it tougher for Americans to boost their
spending after the  holiday shopping season . The figures stand in
contrast to recent data showing declining claims for jobless
benefits and the strongest pace of manufacturing in six months.  “We’re seeing modest growth in services and are likely to
continue to see modest growth as businesses are reluctant to add
to capacity or employment,”  Mark Vitner , a senior economist at
 Wells Fargo Securities LLC  in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , who
correctly forecast the figure. “They are waiting for demand to
improve.”  The services figure for December was the second-lowest
since January 2010. Estimates of the 65 economists in the
Bloomberg survey ranged from 52 to 55. The group’s index
averaged 53.1 since the recession ended in June 2009.  The survey’s employment gauge rose to 49.4 in December from
48.9. The measure of new orders was little changed at 53.2 after
53 in November. A gauge of business activity held at 56.2. The
index of prices paid decreased to 61.2 from 62.5.  Stocks Decline  Stocks held losses after the report, with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index dropping 0.7 percent to 1,269.01 at 10:37 a.m.
in  New York .  Two other reports today showed the labor market is
improving. Companies added 325,000 workers to their payrolls in
December, the most since record-keeping began in 2001, after a
204,000 gain the prior month, according to Roseland, New Jersey-
based ADP Employer Services. The gain topped the highest
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  First-time claims for  jobless benefits (INJCJC)  declined 15,000 last
week to 372,000, the Labor Department said. The average over the
past four weeks fell to the lowest level in more than three
years.  Figures from the agency tomorrow may show the economy
generated 150,000 jobs in December after 120,000 the prior
month, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
 unemployment rate  rose to 8.7 percent after falling to 8.6
percent a month earlier, according to the forecasts.  Private Employment  The report may also show private employment, which excludes
government jobs, climbed 175,000 last month after a 140,000
gain.  Retail sales at stores open more than a year may have
gained as much as 4.5 percent in December, more than previously
estimated, as discounts attracted holiday shoppers, the
 International Council of Shopping Centers  said in a statement
yesterday.  Demand at  Ford Motor Co. (F) ,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Chrysler
Group LLC exceeded analysts’ forecasts in December, other data
showed yesterday. Ford’s U.S. sales climbed 10 percent from a
year earlier, while purchases of Chrysler vehicles were up 37
percent. At GM, they increased 4.5 percent from a year earlier.  ‘Slowly Improving’  “The growth we’re seeing is still based on” a slow
increase in jobs,  Don Johnson , vice president at GM for U.S.
sales, said on a conference call with analysts. “Consumers are
more confident and other underpinnings of our economy are either
stable or slowly improving.”  Consumer  confidence (CONCCONF)  climbed to an eight-month high in
December, according to Conference Board figures last month.  The service industry report follows the group’s
manufacturing data this week that showed an acceleration in
orders and production. The ISM’s index climbed to 53.9 last
month from 52.7 in November.  “The economy has been expanding moderately,
notwithstanding some apparent slowing in global growth,”
Federal Reserve policy makers said Dec. 13 after their latest
meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
