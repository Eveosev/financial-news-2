Cargill Inc. said it was contacted by
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  this week as part of a
“routine trace-back” of all beef suppliers to Hannaford
Supermarkets following a suspected salmonella  outbreak .  Cargill is one of “multiple” fresh-beef suppliers to
Hannaford, Cargill said today in an e-mail. The company said
that it has found no evidence that any of its beef was tainted.  A probe by government inspectors so far “has not been able
to trace the source of the outbreak beyond Hannaford because of
inadequate records and grinding practices at the store chain,”
a spokesman for the USDA’s Food Safety & Inspection Service said
today in an e-mailed statement.  “FSIS has encouraged retailers to provide more complete
information in their grinding logs and will continue to work
with the industry towards addressing this concern,” the agency
spokesman said. “As our investigation continues, the retail
chain indicated they intend to reexamine their grinding
practices and make appropriate changes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
