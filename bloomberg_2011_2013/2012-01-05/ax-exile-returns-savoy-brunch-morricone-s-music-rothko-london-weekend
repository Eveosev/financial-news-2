A tax exile and his wife sneak back
to the U.K. for some time alone at home.  They are met with much commotion in a riotous new staging
of Michael Frayn’s “Noises Off.” The dirty weekend is
disrupted by a frumpy housekeeper, an ageing burglar, a keen
young realtor, and a redhead tax inspector.  That’s just half the story. The other half is the behind-
the-scenes making of the play, which you also see: a spectacle
of swinging doors, missing props, and serial seduction.  Lindsay Posner directs the play at the Old Vic Theatre.

Whitechapel Gallery that are now in a gripping 50th-anniversary
display of letters, photos, and a single canvas.  Walls, he wrote, should be “considerably off-white with
umber and warmed by a little red.” Paintings “should not be
over-lit or romanticized by spots; this results in a distortion
of their meaning.”  Britons (pictured here in their 1960s frames and duffel
coats) liked the show, and Rothko liked them back.  “I feel so in tune with people like Shakespeare and
Dickens,” he wrote, “I often think that they must really have
been Russian Jews who emigrated to  New York .”  “Rothko in Britain” is at the Whitechapel Gallery through
Feb. 26. Information:  http://www.whitechapelgallery.org  or

house near the Whitechapel Gallery, serving gourmet sandwiches
as well as the usual cuts of meat. It’s open from 6 p.m. on
Saturdays and for lunch on Sundays. Information:

will be taken over by themes from “For a Few Dollars More” and
“The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.”  A week after the Southbank Centre hosted a firework display
patriotically set to British music, the Spaghetti Western
Orchestra is looking to America for inspiration. The quintet
plays more than 100 instruments and specializes in tracks by
Ennio Morricone. They add humor with sound effects, blowing on
bottles, crushing cornflakes and bashing squeaky toys.  Concerts through Jan. 11 at Queen Elizabeth Hall, Belvedere
Road, SE1 8XX. Information:  http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk ,

ceramics, stationery and glassware by 40 designers for between
20 pounds ($31.20) and 200 pounds. They may not be precious gems
-- some jewels are even made of plastic and paper -- but they’re
sure to be fresh designs.  “Designers & Makers at Somerset House” ends today:

near Somerset House. It’s certainly not cheap. Yet the Sunday
Jazz Brunch -- 38 pounds for two courses, 46 pounds for three --
at the River Restaurant is worth considering for special
occasions. The  menu  is tempting and there’s a view across the
Thames. Just don’t dress too casual. It’s a fancy restaurant and
sportswear isn’t allowed. Information:  http://bit.ly/fson2e  or
