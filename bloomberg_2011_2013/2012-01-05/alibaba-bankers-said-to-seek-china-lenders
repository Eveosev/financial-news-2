The four banks preparing an about $4
billion loan for  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (ALIBABZ) . are seeking to
attract Chinese lenders into the lead group to help arrange and
underwrite the facility, according to a person familiar with the
matter.  Credit Suisse Group AG, DBS Bank Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG and
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. are arranging the loan, three people
familiar with the matter said on Dec. 15. The size of the loan
is too large for the four to underwrite among themselves, said
the person who spoke today, declining to be identified because
the details are private.  The banks aim to expand the size of the lead group to a
total of five to eight lenders to spread the risk of the
facility, another person said yesterday.  Alibaba and Softbank Corp. are considering acquisition
options related to  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , the largest U.S. internet
portal, three other people familiar with the matter said on Dec.
1. Yahoo owns about 40 percent of Alibaba, the top e-commerce
site in China, and 35 percent of Yahoo  Japan  Corp.  Alibaba may seek to buy back the stake Yahoo owns, while
Softbank may seek to acquire the stake in Yahoo Japan, one of
those three people said last month. Alibaba and Softbank are
also considering a full buyout of Yahoo and are in talks with
Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital LLC about making a bid for
the whole company, the three people said on Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
