Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS)  fell 29 percent
after forecasting a wider loss and announcing possible plans to
spin off its Nook business.  The company now sees full year loss of $1.10 to $1.40 a
share, compared with a previous forecast of losing as much as 50
cents a share. Barnes & Noble blamed the wider loss primarily on
a shortfall in the projected sales of Nook Simple Touch, as well
as additional investments in expanding the Nook business.  The company is exploring options for the Nook unit because
“it’s the right time to investigate our options to unlock that
value,” Chef Executive Officer William Lynch said in a
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
