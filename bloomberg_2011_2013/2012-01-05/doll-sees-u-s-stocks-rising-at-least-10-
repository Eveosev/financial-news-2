U.S. stocks will return at least 10
percent in 2012, beating foreign markets for a third year, while
Treasury yields climb, according to BlackRock Inc.’s  Bob Doll .  The nation’s gross domestic product will expand by 2
percent to 2.5 percent, while earnings trail analyst estimates
for the first time since the last recession, Doll said in a
statement released at a BlackRock event in New York today. He is
the chief investment officer for global equities at the world’s
biggest asset manager.  Doll said in January 2011 that the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index would end the year at 1,350 or higher, U.S. economic
growth would increase to almost 4 percent and the  unemployment
rate  would drop to about 9 percent. GDP expanded 1.8 percent
last year, according to the median economist projection, the
jobless rate retreated to 8.6 percent and the  stock index  ended
the year at 1,257.60.  Forecasters at securities firms are more conservative on
U.S. stocks than any time in seven years, predicting the  S&P 500 
will rise 6.9 percent in 2012 as budget deficits around the
world limit gains. The benchmark gauge will climb to 1,344 after
it was virtually unchanged in 2011 and the U.S. beat every
equity market in the developed world except Ireland, according
to the average forecast of 12 strategists tracked by Bloomberg.  Doll said today that the S&P 500 may exceed 1,350 this
year. It fell 0.8 percent to 1,267.36 at 10:01 a.m. New York
time. While Europe will experience a recession, the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis will ease, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
