Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) ,  Japan ’s fourth-
largest steelmaker, said it is keen to combine its aluminum and
copper operations with other Japanese suppliers of the metals to
reduce costs and negotiate better product prices.  The steelmaker will consider a merger should it find a
“good” partner, President Hiroshi Sato said today at a New
Year gathering held by the Japan Iron and Steel Federation. Kobe
Steel is currently not in discussions with any potential partner,
he said.  Profit (5406)  from Kobe Steel’s aluminum and copper business will
probably slide 32 percent to 10 billion yen ($130 million) in
the year ending March 31, the company said Oct. 31. The division
accounts for about 16 percent of total sales, while steel makes
up 45 percent.  Domestic metal producers may enter into mergers or
alliances after  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  obtained approval from the
Japan Fair Trade Commission last month to take over  Sumitomo
Metal Industries Ltd. (5405) , Sato said. The creation of the world’s
second-biggest steel mill is in line with government efforts to
encourage takeovers to spur growth in the third-largest economy.  Japanese companies must “seriously consider” taking
measures, including merging their operations, to compete
globally as a stronger yen cuts into sales, Nippon Steel
Chairman Akio Mimura said Dec. 15.  Kobe Steel’s Sato said he expects the yen to trade between
78 and 82 to the dollar this year. The currency, which climbed
to a postwar high Oct. 31, has eroded the competitiveness of
Japanese-made products overseas. The yen was at 76.8 to the
dollar as of 5:08 p.m. in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
