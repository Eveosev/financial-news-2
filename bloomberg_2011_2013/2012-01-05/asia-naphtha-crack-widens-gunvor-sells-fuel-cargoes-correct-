(Corrects crude grade in first paragraph of Jan. 4 story)  Asia ’s naphtha crack spread, or
premium to  Brent crude , widened. Gunvor Group Ltd. sold  fuel-oil 
cargoes for a second day in Singapore, the region’s largest oil-
trading center.  Light Distillates  Japan  naphtha (NAPHJPNC)  swaps were at a premium of $84.52 a metric
ton to Brent crude futures at 2:56 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of the profit from making the petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock, was at $72.96 at the end of Asian trading yesterday.  Honam Petrochemical Corp. bought two naphtha cargoes for
delivery in the first half of February to  South Korea  at about
$8 a ton above Japan prices yesterday, a company official said
today. The petrochemical producer also purchased a second-half
February cargo at a $4 premium.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the biggest buyer of  95-RON gasoline (MOGFC95S) 
in  Singapore  last month, purchased 50,000 barrels of the grade
at $123.20 a barrel from Total SA, based on a Bloomberg News
survey of traders who monitored transactions on the Platts
window. Morgan Stanley sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline to
PetroChina Co. at $119.70 a barrel.  Fuel Oil  Gunvor sold two 20,000-ton cargoes of  380-centistoke (N6SHS380)  fuel
oil to Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd., according to the
Bloomberg survey. The Cyprus-based trader received $25 a ton
over average February quotes to load from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2.  Fuel oil’s  discount (PVMPFD1M)  to Dubai crude narrowed 66 cents to
$1.96 a barrel at 2:56 p.m. Singapore time, based on date from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The gap shrank for the fourth
time in five days, signaling reduced losses for refiners turning
oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180)  fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade climbed 25 cents to $12.75 a ton, PVM said. This  viscosity
spread (PVMP13M1)  is the widest since Dec. 16, meaning bunker, or marine
fuel, advanced less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  The premium of  gasoil (GASLSICF) , or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude rose 64 cents to $18.65 a barrel at 2:56 p.m. Singapore
time, according to PVM. This  crack spread (PVMPGDM1)  is the widest since
Dec. 9.  Jet fuel (JETKSIFC) ’s premium to gasoil slid 5 cents to 55 cents a
barrel, PVM said. A narrower  regrade (PVMPJG1M)  indicates it is less
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
