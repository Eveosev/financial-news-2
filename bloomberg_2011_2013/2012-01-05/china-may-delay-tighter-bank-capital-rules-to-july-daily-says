China  may delay its planned
tightening of capital requirements for commercial banks to the
second half of the year after easing monetary policy to support
the economy,  China Daily   reported .  The China Banking Regulatory Commission probably won’t make
the  new capital standards  effective until July, the newspaper
said, citing an unidentified government official. The regulator
said in August it would require a capital adequacy ratio of 11.5
percent for “systemically important banks,” and 10.5 percent
for smaller lenders, beginning Jan. 1.  Tougher capital rules could counter the effect of monetary
policies, the newspaper reported, citing Cao Yuanzheng, chief
economist at  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)   China on Nov. 30 cut the amount of cash that banks need to
set aside as reserves, the first reduction since 2008, as
Europe’s debt crisis threatens exports and growth. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said this week that China may fine-tune monetary policy
in response to simultaneous “downside pressure” on the economy
and elevated inflation.  The CBRC’s press office in Beijing didn’t immediately
respond to two calls seeking comment on the China Daily report.  Chinese banks had a capital adequacy ratio of 12.3 percent
in the third quarter, according to the  regulator’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
