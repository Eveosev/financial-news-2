U.S. lawmakers are investigating
whether  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service failed
to provide accurate ratings of MF Global Holdings Ltd. as the
brokerage spiraled into bankruptcy.  Representative  Randy Neugebauer , a Texas Republican, sent
letters on Dec. 27 to Douglas Peterson, S&P president, and
Raymond McDaniel, Moody’s chief executive officer, asking what
the credit-rating companies knew about the bet on European
sovereign debt that led to the brokerage’s failure.  Congress seeks to determine “whether the ratings somehow
failed to live up to the trust that investors placed in them,”
according to copies of the letters obtained by Bloomberg News.
The House Financial Services Oversight and Investigations
subcommittee asked Peterson and McDaniel to testify at a hearing
either this month or in February, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing anonymous sources.  David Wargin, a spokesman for S&P, and  Michael Adler  of
Moody’s declined to comment. The companies have until Jan. 15 to
respond, the letters said.  Jon Corzine , MF Global’s former chief executive officer, is
the defendant in at least nine lawsuits before a federal judge
in Manhattan that seek compensation for losses from the
company’s bankruptcy, according to court papers. Corzine, who
was co-chairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. before serving as
governor of  New Jersey , has testified before Congress since his
firm’s collapse.  To contact the reporters on this story:
