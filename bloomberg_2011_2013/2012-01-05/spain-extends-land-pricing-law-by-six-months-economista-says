Spain  has extended the deadline for
banks and real estate companies to revalue their undeveloped
land by six months,  El Economista  reported.  Spanish banks and developers have traditionally accounted
for undeveloped land according to its potential future value
rather than as rural land with little or no value, the newspaper
said. The land law, passed by the former Socialist government,
had given banks and developers until the end of 2011 to
downgrade it to rural land, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
