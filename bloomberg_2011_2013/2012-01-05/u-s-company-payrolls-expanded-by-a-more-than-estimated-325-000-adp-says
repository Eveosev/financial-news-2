Companies added more workers than
forecast in December, a sign that the U.S. labor market was
gaining momentum heading into 2012, according to a private
report based on payrolls.  The 325,000 increase was the highest in records going back
to 2001 and exceeded the highest projection in a Bloomberg News
survey after a revised 204,000 gain the prior month, the report
from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer Services showed
today. The median estimate called for an advance of 178,000.  An acceleration in hiring may spur further gains in
 consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of the
world’s largest economy. A Labor Department report tomorrow may
show payrolls rose by 150,000, not enough to keep the
 unemployment rate (USURTOT)  from rising to 8.7 percent, economists in a
Bloomberg survey projected.  “We certainly are seeing resilience in the job market,”
said Sean Incremona, a senior economist at 4cast Inc. in New
York. “We’ve seen some improvement versus earlier in 2011 and
it’s encouraging.”  The projections for December ranged from 125,000 to
230,000, based on the estimates of 38 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  A report today from the Labor Department showed first-time
claims for  jobless benefits (INJCJC)  declined 15,000 last week to
372,000. The average over the past four weeks fell to the lowest
level in more than three years.  Stock Futures   Stock-index futures pared losses after the reports. The
contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in March
fell 0.5 percent to 1,267.3 at 9:14 a.m. in New York.  The December ADP number may have reflected the so-called
purge effect. Workers, regardless of when they are dismissed or
quit, sometimes remain on company records until December, when
businesses update, or purge, their figures with ADP.  “It is a difficult time of year to seasonally adjust the
ADP data,”  Joel Prakken , senior managing director at
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in St. Louis, which produces the data
with ADP, said on a conference call. “In an improving labor
market, it can lead to an upward bias to seasonal job gains.”  Prakken said it wasn’t clear “to what extent this factor
is at play in any particular December.”  The paycheck processor estimates this change when adjusting
its data for seasonal variations and, because there were fewer
firings at the end of 2011 than in previous years, ADP may find
it more difficult to formulate a projection, according to
economists like Peter D’Antonio.  ‘Huge Assumptions’  “This huge purge of workers is beyond the scope of normal
seasonal adjustment,” D’Antonio, an economist at Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. in  New York , said in a research note before
the report. “So the ADP folks have to make huge assumptions for
December that often widely miss the mark.”  ADP’s initial figures for November showed a 206,000 gain,
while the Labor Department’s data two days later registered an
increase of 140,000 in private payrolls for the month.  Job cuts  announced (CHALYOY%)  by U.S. employers increased in December
from the prior year’s decade low, another report today showed.
Planned firings rose 31 percent to 41,785 last month from 32,004
in December 2010, which were the fewest since June 2000,
according to Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Job
cuts totaled 606,082 for all of 2011, up 14 percent from the
previous year.  Goods Producers  Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and
construction companies, had climbed by 52,000 workers, today’s
ADP figures showed. Employment in factories added 22,000 jobs.  Service providers took on 273,000 workers.  Companies employing more than 499 workers added 37,000
jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees, added
140,000 workers and small companies increased payrolls by
148,000, ADP said.  Some financial firms added to their payrolls in 2011.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank,
hired 16,000 workers last year, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  wrote in a yearend e-mail to staff.  Policy makers remain concerned about the number of jobless
Americans.  “While indicators point to some improvement in overall
labor market conditions, the  unemployment rate  remains
elevated,” Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and other
members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement
at the conclusion of a meeting last month in  Washington .  A Labor Department’s report tomorrow may show private
payrolls rose by 175,000 in December, according to the Bloomberg
survey median. Overall hiring, which includes government jobs,
may have climbed after rising 120,000 in November.  The ADP report is based on data from about 337,000
businesses with more than 21 million workers on payrolls.
