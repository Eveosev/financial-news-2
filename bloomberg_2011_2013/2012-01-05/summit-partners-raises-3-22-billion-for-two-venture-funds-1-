Summit Partners, a Boston-based
private equity and venture capital firm, raised $3.22 billion
for two funds as it expands investments in  North America ,  Europe 
and Asia.  The firm raised a $2.7 billion growth equity fund focused
on profitable companies, and plans to invest more than $45
million in each, Summit said today in a statement. The remaining
$520 million fund will target emerging growth companies, with
investments of no higher than $45 million.  Money started pouring into venture capital firms last year,
helped by the initial public offerings of Internet companies
such as  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc. In the first
three quarters of 2011, fundraising rose 26 percent to $12.2
billion from the same period in 2010, according to the  National
Venture Capital Association . While fourth-quarter numbers
haven’t been released, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund raised $625
million and TriplePoint Capital closed a $1 billion fund.  Summit, founded in 1984, has more than 80 investment
professionals in Boston, Palo Alto and  London . The firm said it
will use the new capital to purchase minority and majority
stakes in technology, health-care, financial, consumer and
industrial companies.  The firm has raised a total of $14 billion in 16 funds.
Past investments include WebEx Communications Inc., the Internet
teleconferencing provider purchased by  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , and
 Ubiquiti Networks Inc. (UBNT) , the wireless-network equipment maker
that sold shares to the public last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
