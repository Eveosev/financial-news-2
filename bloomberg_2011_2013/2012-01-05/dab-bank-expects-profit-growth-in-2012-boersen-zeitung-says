DAB Bank AG (DRN)  expects profit growth in
2012, following a slight decline last year, Boersen-Zeitung
cites Markus Gunter, chief executive officer and board
spokesman, as saying in an interview to be published tomorrow.  The head of the German online bank based his outlook on new
trading opportunities for customers and savings from an
investment in the bankâ€™s information-technology systems, the
newspaper said. He also aims to reduce the cost-income ratio
toward 70 percent from more than 80 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
