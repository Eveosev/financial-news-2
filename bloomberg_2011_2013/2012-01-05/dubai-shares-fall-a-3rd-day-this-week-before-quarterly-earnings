Dubai’s benchmark  stock (DFMGI)  index
declined for a third day this week before companies in the
emirate report fourth-quarter earnings and as Asian markets
retreated amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  Emaar Properties PJSC, (EMAAR)  developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, decreased 1.2 percent and property company  Deyaar
Development (DEYAAR)  PJSC headed for the biggest drop since Dec. 26. The
 DFM General Index (DFMGI)  lost 0.4 percent to 1,341.73 at 11:31 a.m. in
Dubai. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  slipped 0.2 percent and  Abu
Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  fell 0.4 percent.  “Investors are pulling back before fourth-quarter results
and there is generally a lack of catalysts in the markets,”
said Waleed Al Khateeb, senior finance manager at Dubai-based
Daman Securities LLC. “Some real estate companies may
disappoint.”  Emaar, which may report earnings on Feb. 9, said Oct. 27
its third-quarter profit fell 34 percent as revenue declined and
property delivery slowed. Developers in the  United Arab Emirates 
have been hurt after real-estate prices fell more than half
since their peak in 2008 as speculative demand waned and banks
tightened lending.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  retreated 0.6 percent yesterday
and the  MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 0.6 percent today.
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s largest bank, said it will sell new
shares in a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.8 billion) offer to strengthen
its capital position and Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said
 Greece  is at risk of a “disorderly default.”  About 10 million shares  were traded (VOLDFM)  in Dubai so far today,
compared with a 12-month daily average of about 99 million
shares. Emaar fell to 2.5 dirhams and Deyaar decreased 2.3
percent to 21.2 fils.  Bahrain’s  measure (BHSEASI)  was little changed. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  fell
0.3 percent and Kuwait’s  gauge (KWSEIDX)  slipped 0.1 percent. Oman’s
benchmark stock  index (MSM30)  gained 0.4 percent. Saudi Arabia’s measure
is closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
