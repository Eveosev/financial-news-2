Following is the text of the U.S.
 Seasonal Drought Outlook  as released by the  National Weather
Service  in Camp Springs, Maryland:  Latest Seasonal Assessment - The drought outlook for January 5 -
March 31, 2012 was based upon climate anomalies associated with
La Nina, short to medium range forecasts, climatology, and
initial conditions. Persistence or development can be expected
across much of the Southeast with the highest forecast
confidence in  Florida . Frequent periods of precipitation
improved drought conditions across the southern Plains during
the past two months. However, a return of dry weather and the
ongoing La Nina favor persistence across most of southern
Kansas, Oklahoma, and  Texas . Despite the early winter snowfall
in Arizona and  New Mexico , La Nina elevates the odds for drought
persistence across the Southwest. A lack of early winter
precipitation resulted in moderate drought development and
expansion of abnormal dryness across southern Oregon,
 California , and Nevada. Antecedent dryness coupled with no wet
signal among precipitation tools favor persistence across
northern California and northwest Nevada, while La Nina favors
development across southern California. Some improvement is
forecast in southern Oregon where La Nina tends to bring heavier
precipitation amounts. A relatively dry winter climatology
elevates the chances for persistence across the western Corn
Belt and upper Mississippi Valley. Drought improvement is
forecast for Hawaii which is consistent with a La Nina winter.  SOURCE: National Weather Service  To contact the reporter on this story:
