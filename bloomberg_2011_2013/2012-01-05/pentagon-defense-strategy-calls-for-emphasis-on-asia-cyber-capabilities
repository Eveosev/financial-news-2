 The U.S. military pledged to put
greater emphasis on its role in  Asia  and on space and cyber
capabilities as part of a revamped global strategy while
preserving missions such as defeating al-Qaeda in an era of
budget cuts.  “As we end today’s wars, we will focus on a broader range
of challenges and opportunities, including the security and
prosperity of the Asia Pacific,” President  Barack Obama  said in
an introduction to the Pentagon strategy to be released today in
Washington. “We are shaping a Joint Force for the future that
will be smaller and leaner but will be agile, flexible, ready
and technologically advanced.”  The report was obtained from sources outside the Pentagon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
