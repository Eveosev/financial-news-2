The sheriff of Jefferson County,
 Alabama , and his deputies can’t temporarily avoid lawsuits as a
result of the county’s bankruptcy, a judge ruled.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas B. Bennett said civil rights
and other suits against Sheriff Mike Hale may proceed so long as
the plaintiffs understand they won’t collect any money from the
county while it’s in bankruptcy. The sheriff’s department is
funded by the county, which may be forced to pay the sheriff’s
legal bills.  Plaintiffs who win a judgment against the sheriff will have
to return to court for a separate ruling after the bankruptcy is
over to collect any money from the county, Bennett said.  “Why would you want to go forward if you have to come back
and re-litigate,” Bennett asked lawyers for a group of people
suing the sheriff’s department?  Jefferson County filed bankruptcy last year after the
county, state officials and bondholders failed to implement a
tentative agreement that would have cut debt by about $1
billion.  Hale asked Bennett to determine whether the sheriff’s
department is entitled to the so-called automatic stay of
lawsuits granted the county when it filed bankruptcy in
November.  The case is In re Jefferson County, 11-05736-9,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham).  To contact the reporter on this story:
