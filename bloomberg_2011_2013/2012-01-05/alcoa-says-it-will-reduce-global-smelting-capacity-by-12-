Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum
producer, will close 12 percent of its global smelting capacity
after the price of the lightweight metal slumped amid a global
surplus.  The company will permanently close its smelter at Alcoa,
 Tennessee , and two of six idled potlines at its Rockdale, Texas,
plant, eliminating 291,000 metric tons of annual capacity, the
New York-based company said yesterday in a statement. An
additional 240,000 tons of curtailments will be announced “in
the near future.”  Aluminum, which is used in beverage cans, auto parts and
aircraft, tumbled 18 percent in 2011 as global economic growth
decelerated. The drop has pushed  inventories (MRSELSAL)  to their highest in
at least eight years and made some smelters unprofitable.
Analysts have reduced their fourth-quarter earnings estimates
for Alcoa by 88 percent in the last month to an average of 1
cent a share.  “These are difficult but necessary steps,” Alcoa Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  said in the
statement.  The cuts are expected to be completed in the first half of
this year. Alcoa, which reports its earnings on Jan. 9, will
take a charge of $155 million to $165 million, or 15 to 16 cents
a share, for the fourth quarter.  Alcoa said its current global smelting capacity is 4.5
million tons a year. The cutbacks announced yesterday are equal
to about 1 percent of global smelting  capacity (AWSCCAWT) , which stands at
49 million tons, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  ‘Meaningful’ Cuts  Alcoa fell 1.7 percent to $9.20 at 6:37 p.m. in after-hours
trading in New York yesterday. The stock slumped 44 percent last
year, the second-biggest decline in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average .  The curtailments are “meaningful to them, but it’s not
that much to world supply,”  Charles Bradford , president of
Bradford Research in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“If you have less supply, that should help the metal price but
I’m not so sure it’s going to work this time.”  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange, the benchmark price on the world’s largest metals
bourse, fell 1.4 percent to $2,036 a ton yesterday. It traded at
$1,956 on Dec. 14, a 17-month low.  Alcoa cut production by about 750,000 tons, or about 18
percent of capacity, in 2009. Russia’s United Co. Rusal and
 Norway ’s  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY)  also reduced output that year after
aluminum prices tumbled 36 percent in 2008.  Deripaska’s Warning  The possibility of similar output cuts reemerged in the
final months of 2011 as the aluminum price declined again. Oleg Deripaska, CEO of Rusal, the world’s largest producer, said last
month that falling prices may force 3 million tons of capacity
to be closed or mothballed.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest producer, said
in November it would close its Lynemouth smelter in
Northumberland,  England , because of increasing energy costs.
London-based Rio said in October it would sell 13 aluminum
assets to improve its financial performance.  Norsk Hydro,  Europe ’s third-biggest producer, said in
October that it had no plans to restart the 26 percent of its
capacity that was shuttered in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
