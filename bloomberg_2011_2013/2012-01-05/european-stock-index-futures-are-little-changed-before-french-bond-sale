European stocks (SXXP)  declined for a second
day as concern that the region’s banks will have to raise
capital overshadowed a report showing that U.S. companies added
more workers to their payrolls than economists had predicted.  UniCredit SpA, which announced a rights offer at a 43
percent discount yesterday, slumped to a 19-year low. Societe
Generale SA dropped 5.4 percent after announcing it will cut
corporate- and investment-banking staff.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.9 percent to 247.39 at
the close in  London . The gauge lost 11 percent last year as
policy makers struggled to contain the euro area’s debt crisis.  “UniCredit’s capital call spooked investors and reduced
confidence in banking short term,” said Torben Hoeyer, the
chief equity adviser at Nordea Private Banking in Copenhagen.
“Now rumors are going round that other banks may also sell
shares and that’s pushing stocks lower.”  Italy’s largest lender (UCG)  declined 17 percent to 4.48 euros,
its lowest price since September 1992. The bank announced a plan
to sell new shares at a discount because the debt crisis is
worsening, Chief Executive officer Federico Ghizzoni told  Il
Sole 24 Ore  in an interview. He added that he expects other
banks raising money to do the same.  National benchmark indexes fell in every west-European
market, except Denmark and  Norway .  France ’s CAC 40 Index dropped
1.5 percent, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.8 percent and
 Germany ’s DAX Index lost 0.3 percent.  U.S. Payrolls  In the U.S., private employers added 325,000 workers to
payrolls in December, according to a report from Roseland, New
Jersey-based ADP Employer Services. That was the biggest
increase in records going back to 2001. The median projection in
the survey called for an advance of 178,000.  A report from the Labor Department showed that the number
of applications for  jobless benefits (INJCJC)  fell by 15,000 last week to
372,000. Economists had forecast a drop to 375,000.  France sold 7.96 billion euros ($10.2 billion) of debt
today as borrowing costs rose. The government sold 4.02 billion
euros of benchmark 10-year bonds at an average yield of 3.29
percent from 3.18 percent in an auction on Dec. 1. The nation
also sold debt maturing in 2023, 2035 and 2041.  Germany yesterday sold 4.1 billion euros of bonds kicking
off a rush for funding that may determine whether euro-area
leaders can save the 13-year-old single currency. Italy and
 Spain  will raise funds in the coming weeks. Sovereign-debt sales
in the region may reach 262 billion euros in the first quarter,
according to  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  forecasts.  Greece ’s Papademos  In Greece, Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said that deeper
cuts in incomes are the only way for the country to remain in
the euro area and receive more financing from international
creditors. These steps are necessary to avert an economic
collapse that may otherwise come as soon as March, he said.  In Germany,  retail sales (GRFRIAMM) , adjusted for inflation and
seasonal swings, decreased 0.9 percent in November, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said.  Economists had forecast (GRFRIAMM)  a
gain of 0.2 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  A gauge of European banks was the worst performer among the
19  industry groups (SXXP)  on the Stoxx 600, losing 3.2 percent.  Banco Santander SA and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA,
Spain’s biggest lenders, declined 4.5 percent to 5.53 euros and
5 percent to 6.30 euros, respectively, after the Financial Times
cited Economy Minister Luis de Guindos as saying banks will have
to allocate as much as 50 billion euros in further provisions
for “troubled” real-estate assets.  Deutsche Bank AG, Germany’s largest lender, tumbled 5.6
percent to 27.97 euros for its biggest drop since November.  Societe Generale (GLE)  Job Cuts  Societe Generale, France’s second-largest lender, retreated
5.4 percent to 16.08 euros after saying it will cut about 1,580
jobs at its corporate and investment bank, about 10 percent of
the unit’s total staff.  Nokia Oyj rose 7.1 percent to 4.16 euros after Credit
Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation to “outperform” from
“underperform.” The company considers Risto Siilasmaa, the
founder of security software maker F-Secure Oyj, as the
frontrunner to become its next chairman, a person familiar with
the matter said.  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the U.K. oilfield-services provider,
advanced 1.9 percent to 1,493 pence after agreeing with
 Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  to cooperate on production projects.  Brenntag AG (BNR)  fell 1.2 percent to 71.40 euros, its biggest
drop in four weeks. Brachem Acquisition SCA sold an 8.7 percent
stake in the chemical distributor to institutional investors for
about 315 million euros.  CRH Plc (CRH)  and  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  fell 2.7 percent to 15.06
euros and 2.8 percent to 33.61 euros, respectively. Credit
Suisse lowered its recommendation on both companies to
“underperform” and said volumes, prices and margins in the
building-materials business will remain “challenged.”  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. rose 4.6 percent to 695
pence after agreeing to pay $1.25 billion to acquire First
Quantum Minerals Ltd.’s assets in the  Democratic Republic  of the
Congo, ending a legal dispute between the parties, the companies
said in statements today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
