Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s largest
automaker, said its  China  vehicle sales rose at the slowest pace
in at least seven years after natural disasters disrupted output
and the removal of tax breaks dented demand.  Deliveries in China for the Toyota City, Japan-based
company increased 4 percent last year to 883,000 vehicles,
according to an e-mailed statement today. That’s the slowest
pace of annual expansion since at least 2004, according to
company data. The  automaker (7203)  said it aims for sales in the
country to exceed 1 million units this year.  China’s overall  vehicle sales growth (CNVSPSGR)  is forecast to slow to
as low as 3 percent for 2011, from a record 32 percent increase
in 2010 as inflation, higher  interest rates  and the end of two-
year-long incentives for car purchases deterred consumers.
Production at Toyota’s assembly plants in the country fell to as
low as 30 percent of normal levels following the earthquake in
 Japan  last March.  “Toyota’s growth in China was undermined by the earthquake
but also as a result of its conservative strategy,”  Harry Chen ,
an analyst with Guotai Junan Securities Co. in Shenzhen, said
before the company’s announcement. “They have been adding new
models at a slower pace than the rivals and if they don’t become
more aggressive, they will lose more market share.”  Toyota, which has joint ventures with  China FAW Group Corp. (CHFAWZ) 
and  Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. (2238) , began producing its third-
generation Prius hybrid last month in northeastern China for
sale early this year. The automaker introduced three new models
last year, according to the company.  Market Share  Toyota had 5.92 percent of the country’s passenger car
market, compared with  GM (GM) ’s 17.9 percent, according to
calculations based on January-to-November data from the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers. GM, the biggest foreign
automaker in China, expanded its sales in the country by 8.2
percent to 2.35 million units in the first 11 months of last
year.  Overall vehicle sales last year probably grew between 3
percent to 5 percent, according to the carmakers’ group.  Last month, Toyota said its global vehicle sales may rise
the most in at least 12 years in 2012. Its sales fell an
estimated 6 percent last year because of disruptions caused by a
record earthquake in Japan and  Thailand ’s worst floods in almost
70 years.  The carmaker may boost global deliveries by 20 percent to
8.48 million vehicles this year from an estimated 7.05 million
in 2011, it said in a Dec. 22 statement. The forecast excludes
Toyota’s Hino Motors Ltd. and Daihatsu Motor Co. units.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
