Alaska (STOAK1) ’s general-obligation debt was
boosted to AAA from AA+ by  Standard & Poor’s , which cited
safeguards the state has incorporated in its budget process.  The ratings company also upgraded appropriations-backed
certificates of participation to AA+, second-highest, and AA,
according to a statement released today. The state was already
rated Aaa by Moody’s Investors Service.  “Before even reaching the point of needing to tap its
formal budget reserves, the state has several layers of fiscal
flexibility it could exploit,” Gabriel Petek, a San Francisco-
based analyst for S&P, said in the statement.  The state prefunds about 20 percent of its annual operating
budget and uses cash to finance a large portion of its capital
projects, Petek said. The state also has “unusually high”
budget reserves, according to the statement.  “Taken together, these attributes provide  Alaska  with a
uniquely high degree of fiscal flexibility,” Petek said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
