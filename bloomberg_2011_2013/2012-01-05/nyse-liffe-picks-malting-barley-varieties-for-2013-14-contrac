NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of
NYSE Euronext, picked malting barley varieties Sebastian and
Syngenta AG’s Quench as eligible for delivery against futures
contracts for the 2013-14 crop year.  The varieties picked by an expert committee are unchanged
from those for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 harvest seasons, Lionel
Porte, commodity-product manager at NYSE Liffe, said by phone in
Paris today. For 2010-11, the eligible varieties were Sebastian
and Syngenta’s Tipple.  Sebastian is a spring-barley variety grown across  Europe 
and Quench is a spring malting-barley variety developed by
Basel, Switzerland-based Syngenta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
