Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds capped
their longest winning streak in a month on speculation the
central bank may lower interest rates to protect the economy
from the global slowdown.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.70 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. Yields have declined for five straight days, the
longest streak since the period ending Dec. 2 when they fell for
six days. The security’s price rose 0.04 centimo to 114.33
centimos per sol.  Peru’s central bank kept its key  interest rate  unchanged
for a seventh month in December on forecasts that slower growth
will bring down inflation from a two-year high. Weaker global
demand will limit the economy’s expansion to 5.5 percent this
year and help cool inflation, Cabinet Chief Oscar Valdes told
Congress today.  “The central bank will probably make a small cut in
interest rates at some point this year if it sees a
deceleration” in the economy, said Manuel Aldave, head of
investments at Banco Internacional del Peru in  Lima .  The yield on the nation’s 6.55 percent dollar-denominated
bond due March 2037 rose four basis points to 4.75 percent.  The Andean nation’s economy probably expanded 6.8 percent
last year, after 8.8 percent growth in 2010, the central bank
said Dec. 16. The annual inflation rate accelerated to 4.74
percent last month, the highest since March 2009.  The sol was little changed at 2.6948 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6940 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
