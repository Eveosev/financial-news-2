Democrats, who must defend eight of
the 11 governorships on November’s ballot, enter 2012 at a
fundraising disadvantage after the  Republican Governors
Association  more than doubled its Democratic counterpart’s
contributions last year.  The Republican governors raised $44 million in 2011,
compared with about $20 million for the Democratic Governors
Association, the groups said in separate statements. Both
organizations said they raised record amounts last year. Their
formal filings are due at the  Internal Revenue Service  at the
end of the month.  In the 2010 elections, Democrats retained governorships in
Kentucky and West Virginia, while Republicans kept seats in
Louisiana and Mississippi. The two governors’ groups are led by
chief executives of neighboring states -- Maryland’s  Martin O’Malley , a Democrat, and Virginia’s Bob McDonnell, a
Republican. They can contribute directly to gubernatorial
candidates and to the state parties, and advertise in support of
their parties’ nominees.  Of the 50 state governorships, Republicans hold 29 and
Democrats have 20. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee is an
independent.  Both organizations reported that their 2011 fundraising
exceeded their takes for 2007, the previous year that preceded a
presidential election. The RGA raised $22 million in 2007 and
the DGA brought in $13 million, IRS records show.  Cash on Hand  Going into 2012, the Republican group said it had almost
$27 million in the bank.  “This year, the RGA will be on offense in eight of 11
states scheduled to hold governors’ races, and is in position to
make game-changing investments in our races, including those in
critical presidential and Senate battleground states,”
McDonnell said in a statement.  The DGA had $12.2 million in cash, and O’Malley said the
money would help the group support the Democratic nominees.  “Because of our strong efforts in 2011, we will have the
resources to aid Democratic candidates in targeted states and
continue to fight for our core priorities: Jobs. Opportunity.
Now,” O’Malley said in a statement.  The top donors to the Republican governors through June 30
were  David Koch , executive vice president of Wichita, Kansas-
based Koch Industries Inc., and Terry Stephens, owner of
 Stephens Pipe & Steel LLC (0002203D)  in Russell Springs, Kentucky. Each
gave $1 million.  The Democratic group received $265,000 from the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug
industry’s Washington-based trade group, and $250,000 apiece
from New York-based drugmaker  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and  Exelon Corp. (EXC) , a
utility company based in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
