Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s second-
biggest cement maker, got approval from New Zealand’s foreign
investment regulator to lease port land near a proposed plant.  The value of the lease of the 2.3 hectares of land near
Timaru on New Zealand’s  South Island  wasn’t disclosed in the
approval notice posted on the Overseas Investment Office
 website . The lease agreement is with PrimePort Timaru Ltd.,
which is 71 percent owned by the Timaru District Council.  Holcim New Zealand plans to build a cement storage facility
on the site, which is a “critical part” of development of a
new cement plant near Oamaru, about 49 miles south, it said in
its application. In October, Holcim said consideration of the
new project by its Swiss parent isn’t expected until late 2012
because of deteriorating global economic conditions.  Holcim, which makes about half of  New Zealand ’s cement, has
been considering the project since 2006 to replace its ageing
Westport plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
