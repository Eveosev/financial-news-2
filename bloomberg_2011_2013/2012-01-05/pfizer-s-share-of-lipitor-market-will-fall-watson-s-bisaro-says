Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s market share for the
cholesterol pill  Lipitor (PHAM1150) , now at 41 percent after losing patent
protection last year, will decline further in the next five
months, according to generic-drug maker  Watson Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (WPI)   Watson, producer of a Pfizer-authorized copy of Lipitor,
competes with a generic version made by India’s Ranbaxy
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Watson and Ranbaxy entered the U.S. market
on Nov. 11, and have exclusive rights for 180 days before other
manufacturers can sell copies.  Paul Bisaro , Watson’s chief executive officer, today
revised a forecast he made last year that New York-based Pfizer
would hold onto 40 percent of the market once the copycats went
on sale. Pfizer gets revenue from Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson’s version.  “Their ability to maintain that 40 percent will probably
erode,” Bisaro said at an investor conference held by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in  New York . “History would indicate that it
would come down a little bit.”  Pfizer’s share of the market was 41 percent as of Dec. 24
for the second week in a row, according to an report from
Bloomberg Industries.  Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $21.60 at the close of
New York trading. Watson gained 2.8 percent to $61.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
