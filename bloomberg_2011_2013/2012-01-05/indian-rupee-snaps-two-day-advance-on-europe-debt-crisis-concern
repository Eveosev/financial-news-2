India ’s rupee snapped a two-day gain
as concern  Europe  will struggle to contain its debt crisis
damped demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency erased earlier gains after France’s borrowing
costs rose at an auction of 10-year bonds today. Greek Prime
Minister  Lucas Papademos  said yesterday the economy could
collapse as early as March if the country doesn’t accept income
cuts needed to secure more international aid. The MSCI  Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares lost 0.7 percent.  “Europe’s problems will remain the main drivers for the
rupee,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at Development Credit
Bank in Mumbai. “Each piece of negative news will see a bout of
risk aversion and losses in the rupee.”  The rupee slipped to 52.9850 per dollar in Mumbai, from
52.9775 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
advanced 0.7 percent earlier. The rupee tumbled 16 percent last
year, more than triple the loss in the next worst-performer
among Asia’s 10 most-used currencies, and reached a record low
of 54.3050 on Dec. 15.  France sold 10-year bonds at an average yield of 3.29
percent at today’s auction, up from 3.18 percent in December,
and the yield on Hungary’s one-year bills climbed to the highest
level since 2009.  The  Reserve Bank  of India is “very concerned” about the
impact of the rupee’s depreciation on inflation, Deputy Governor
Subir Gokarn said at a conference in  Singapore  today. India’s
inflation rate averaged 9.6 percent in the first 11 months of
last year, government data show.  Three-month offshore forwards for the rupee traded at 53.92
to the dollar, compared with 54.16 yesterday. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
