Mexico ’s lower house of the Congress
may discuss during its next session changes to the nation’s
labor law that seek to make  employment (MXUERATE)  contracts more flexible,
the speaker of the lower house said.  Guadalupe Acosta, from the Revolutionary Democratic Party,
or PRD, said in an interview yesterday he is lobbying leaders
from the nation’s seven parties for support. He also seeks
support for a constitutional amendment that would allow lawmaker
re-election and an initiative to improve national security, he
said.  On Jan. 16 Acosta will meet with parties leaders in the
lower house to set up the agenda for the session starting Feb. 1
and ending April 30.  Editors: Jonathan Roeder, Jose Enrique Arrioja  To contact the reporters on this story:
