Sales of bonds tied to commercial
mortgages will probably fall 11 percent to about $25 billion
this year after price swings stoked by  Europe ’s debt crisis
tightened creditor standards, according to  Citigroup Inc. (C)   Issuance may climb as high as $35 billion if European
leaders gain control over the region’s debt strains and if U.S
growth accelerates, Citigroup analysts led by Jeffrey Berenbaum
said in a report dated yesterday. The New York-based research
team said sales of the bonds, which are tied to everything from
skyscrapers to strip malls, may be as low as $20 billion this
year if the  U.S. economy  slows.  Banks pulled back from making new loans to package into
bonds during the second half of 2011 as volatile credit markets
crimped profit margins. Relative yields on top-ranked securities
backed by commercial mortgages have  narrowed (LCSDOAS)  to 244 basis points
more than Treasuries after soaring to a 20-month high of 323
basis points on Oct. 4. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “The volatility experienced by the market since the third
quarter has pushed underwriting criteria tighter and even driven
some lenders out of the market” after a “promising” first
half of 2011, the analysts wrote.  Wall Street banks arranged about $28 billion in bonds
backed by commercial mortgages last year, compared with $11.5
billion in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Issuance peaked at $232 billion in 2007.  Bank analyst estimates for issuance in 2012 have ranged
from a forecast of as much as $45 billion by  UBS AG (UBSN)  to
expectations of $25 billion by Citigroup and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)   “If Europe makes credible progress on solving its
sovereign debt issues, the U.S. economic outlook continues to
brighten and global political unrest subsides, CMBS can rebound
as strongly as it fizzled in 2011,” the Citigroup analysts
wrote.  More than $43 billion mortgages packaged and sold as bonds
mature in 2012, according to Citigroup. The loans, many of which
were taken out when property values peaked in 2007, will face
higher refinancing hurdles than those that came due in 2011 amid
tighter lending standards, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
