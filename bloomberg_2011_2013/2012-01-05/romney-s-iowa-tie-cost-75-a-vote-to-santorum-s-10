Rick Santorum  almost tied Mitt Romney
in Iowa’s caucuses while being outspent 7 to 1 on television,
showing that old-fashioned retail politics still works in the
Hawkeye State.  The BGOV Barometer indicates Romney and his supporters
spent an estimated $2.3 million on  TV advertising  in Iowa, which
comes down to $75.44 for each of the 30,015 votes he garnered in
the Jan. 3 caucuses. Santorum’s backers spent $303,570 for TV
ads on his behalf, or $10.12 for each of his 30,007 votes.  All of the money spent on ads supporting Santorum came from
independent political action committees that can take unlimited
donations. So-called super PACs helped push spending on
television advertising in the state to an estimated $7 million
through Jan. 2, according to the most recent data available from
New York-based Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group. Of
that amount, $4.3 million financed negative ads, most aimed at
former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , who placed fourth in the
caucuses.  Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, finished a
strong second after criss-crossing the state in a supporter’s
pickup truck. While Romney, the former governor of
Massachusetts, spent more than Santorum, he invested less in the
Iowa race than he had four years ago. He had five local staffers
this time versus 50 in 2008.  Final spending numbers for the candidates aren’t yet
available. Latest figures from the Campaign Media Analysis Group
show  Rick Perry  and his supporters had the worst return on their
investment. The Perry campaign and independent political action
committees spent a combined $2.8 million on advertising, or
$218.65 for each of his 12,604 votes, a fifth-place finish for
the Texas governor.  Ron Paul , who placed third, and Gingrich, who ran fourth,
spent similar amounts per vote. Paul, the Texas congressman,
spent $997,370 and drew 26,219 votes, or $38.04 per vote.
Gingrich and his supporters spent $611,470 and he drew 16,251
votes. That’s $37.63 a vote.  Representative  Michele Bachmann  of Minnesota garnered 6,073
votes after spending $59,930, which works out to $9.87 a vote.
She dropped out of the race after her sixth-place finish in
Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
