Currency markets aren’t pricing in a
breakup of the euro,  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group of 10
foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, said
today during an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the
Loop” with Betty Liu.  On members’ leaving the 17-nation common currency:  “The market is very cognizant and has been for quite some
time that there’s some very significant downside risk as far as
the euro is concerned, and increasingly they’re putting their
money where their thoughts are.”  “You’re seeing the euro really trade quite weak against a
host of currencies, some currencies that you wouldn’t expect
would benefit from the euro, like, for example,  Sweden  has done
very well, even the pound has done well.”  “The biggest beneficiaries are the dollar and the yen.”  “If you were to get even a splintering, for example, say
one country were to leave the euro, which is not our forecast,
then you could easily see the euro at say parity, for example. I
don’t think that’s a ridiculously bold forecast.”  On the yen’s expected performance in 2012:  “Lightening is going to strike three times.”  “I think with this year as well the yen will do very, very
well against the euro in particular. There, I could see euro-
yen, for example, going back down to 90.”  “What we’re already seeing is a lot of people are parking
their money into Japanese money-market funds.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
