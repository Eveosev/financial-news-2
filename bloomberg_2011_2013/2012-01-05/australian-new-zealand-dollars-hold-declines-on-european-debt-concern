The Australian dollar fell for a
third day against its U.S. counterpart, its longest losing
streak in three weeks, as concern that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis is deepening sapped demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie briefly erased its drop after a report showed
U.S. payrolls report swelled and the nation’s  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly dropped. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi,
dropped to a four-day low before trading little changed.  “A worsening of Europe’s debt problem accelerates  risk
aversion  and therefore is a selling catalyst” for the
Australian and New Zealand dollars, said Takuya Kawabata, a
researcher in Tokyo at Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd., a
unit of Japan’s largest currency margin company.  Australia’s dollar weakened 0.2 percent to $1.0240 at 3:09
p.m. in  New York  after dropping earlier as much as 0.6 percent.
It fell 0.4 percent to 78.85 yen. New Zealand’s currency traded
at 78.16 U.S. cents after touching 77.75 yen earlier, the lowest
since Jan. 2, and was little changed at 60.20 yen.  Both South Pacific currencies gained for a third week
against the greenback, with the Aussie rising 0.3 percent and
the kiwi advancing 0.6 percent.  The MSCI World Index of stocks fell 0.4 percent today, and
the MSCI  Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  retreated 0.9 percent as investors
sought safer assets.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 200,000 jobs last month,
Labor Department data showed today in Washington. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a rise of 155,000.
The unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent, the lowest level
since February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
