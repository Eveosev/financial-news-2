European Union carbon permits for
December may rise to 7.45 euros ($9.54) a metric ton after
technical charts showed a so-called doji star reversal pattern
yesterday, according to OTC Europe LLP.  A doji formation is created when a security ends near the
previous day’s closing price after moving higher and lower
during the trading session.  Other technical indicators, including relative strength
indicators and Elliot Wave patterns, show benchmark carbon
permits may advance after a record low yesterday of 6.38 euros a
ton, said Brett Genus, a technical analyst and broker for OTC
Europe LLP.  “We are cautiously optimistic on price, mainly due to
momentum indicators that are unsupportive of the notion that
price is weak enough to extend further,” he said today in an e-
mailed statement.  EU allowances jumped as much as 5 percent to 6.90 euros a
ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange and were at 6.70 euros at
4:02 p.m. in  London . The contract closed down 0.5 percent
yesterday after rising as much as 9.6 percent and falling as
much as 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
