Agco Corp. (AGCO) , a U.S. maker of farm
equipment, forecasts that sales will rise to $10 billion this
year, from $9 billion in 2011, as the growing global population
increases demand for its products, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported today, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Martin Richenhagen.  The CEO doesnâ€™t rule out a takeover by another company or a
merger with a peer, the newspaper cited him as saying. There may
be logic in a merger with  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  because Agco uses
many products from that company, the FAZ cited Richenhagen as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
