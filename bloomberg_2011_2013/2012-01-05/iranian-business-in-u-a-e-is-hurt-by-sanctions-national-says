Iranian businesses in the  United Arab
Emirates  are feeling the impact of tighter sanctions as visas
are refused, profits fall and banking becomes more difficult,
 The National  reported.  Difficulties obtaining visas mean fewer Iranian traders
have been able to make the trip to the U.A.E. in recent months
and securing letters of credit from a bank is harder for
Iranians, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
