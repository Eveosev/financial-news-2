The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase shipments of crude oil this
month to meet winter demand for heating fuels, according to
tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC will ship (OPCRTOTL)  23.64 million barrels a day in the four
weeks to Jan. 21, up 0.3 percent from the 23.58 million barrels
loaded daily in the month to Dec. 24, the Halifax, England-based
researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The figures exclude
 Angola  and Ecuador.  “Crude demand is heading for another winter peak,” which
is typically in the middle of February, Roy Mason, founder of
Oil Movements, said by phone. “OPEC supply is coming up again,
and in the background of course you’ve got more Libyan crude.
It’s mostly Asian demand.”  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including non-OPEC
members Oman and Yemen, will be little changed at 17.87 million
barrels a day, according to estimates from Oil Movements.  Crude on board tankers will average 476.65 million barrels
in the four-week period to Jan. 21, down 2.6 percent from 489.62
million in the period to Dec. 24, according to today’s report.
Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-rental
agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships as
floating storage.  OPEC’s members, which pump 40 percent of the world’s oil,
are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq, Kuwait,  Libya ,
 Nigeria , Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
