Barclays Plc (BARC)  said investors tendered
2.45 billion pounds ($3.79 billion) of securities as the U.K.â€™s
second-largest bank by assets seeks to improve the quality of
capital it holds.  The lender said on Dec. 5 it would offer to buy back as
much as 2.5 billion pounds of the Tier 1 securities for a
discount of as much as 30 percent to face value. Investors will
be paid on Jan. 9, London-based Barclays said in a statement
today.  Barclays is buying back the debt because it will count less
toward the highest form of capital when the latest round of
rules set by the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  take
effect in 2013. Regulators are pressing banks to boost capital,
or their ability to absorb losses, to shield taxpayers from the
costs of future bailouts. Lloyds Banking Group Plc and BNP
Paribas SA have announced similar deals in the past two months.  The pool of debt investors sold back to the bank included
core Tier-1 notes and reserve capital instruments in both U.S.
dollars and British pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
