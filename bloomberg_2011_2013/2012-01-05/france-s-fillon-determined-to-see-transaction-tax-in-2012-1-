France  is “determined” to put in
place a tax on financial transactions in 2012, French Prime
Minister  Francois Fillon  said.  “It is normal that all sectors contribute to the
collective effort, including the financial sector,” Fillon said
today at a conference in Paris. “France has never ceased to
promote a tax on financial transactions with its partners.”  European Union leaders will discuss introducing the tax on
transactions at their Jan. 30 summit, with the levy backed by
the French and German governments, and opposed by Britain, home
to  Europe ’s largest financial center.  “We still want to convince all our partners to do it
together but France and Germany will take the lead in this
movement,” Valerie Pecresse, the French government’s
spokeswoman, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
“France is ready to assume its responsibilities.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
