The European Commission is preparing
an infringement procedure against  Hungary  because the country
has scrapped the position of a data protection ombudsman, the
news website  Origo  reported, without identifying its sources.  European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has asked
his colleagues to keep Hungary’s government under “strong
pressure,” Origo said.  Besides earlier criticism of Hungary’s new central bank and
stability laws, the commission may also investigate the
country’s new constitution and related “cardinal” laws, Origo
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
