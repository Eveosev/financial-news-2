Chey Tae Won, the chairman of  South
Korea ’s third-largest industrial group, was indicted on charges
that he embezzled funds from  SK Holdings Co. (003600)  affiliates to cover
investment losses by him and his younger brother.  Seoul prosecutors, who held a televised briefing on Chey’s
indictment today, didn’t detain the 51-year-old. The chairman
hasn’t used any company money inappropriately and will prove his
innocence in court, SK said in an e-mailed response to questions
from Bloomberg News.  SK Holdings has businesses including oil exploration and
refining, chemicals, telecommunications and transportation. The
indictment came on the same day that  SK group (SKGZ)  companies said
they would more than double investment to 19 trillion won ($16.5
billion) this year from 2011 and hire 7,000 more workers.  The investigation may have a “psychological” impact on SK
companies while it shouldn’t affect the day-to-day running of
individual businesses, said Lee Jin Woo, a  fund manager  at
Seoul-based KTB Asset Management Co.  Chey, who in 2008 was pardoned by President  Lee Myung Bak 
of a fraud conviction, pledged to keep his businesses unaffected
by the current investigation, SK said in a statement on Dec. 23.  SK Telecom Co. (017670) , South Korea’s No. 1 mobile-phone operator,
agreed in November to pay 3.4 trillion won for a controlling
stake in  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)   Had the indictment come earlier, it could have derailed a
large acquisition like Hynix, said Kim Hong Sik, a Seoul-based
analyst at NH Investment & Securities.  Vice Chairman Chey Jae Won was arrested on Dec. 29. The
brothers are accused of misappropriating money to make up for
futures and options investment losses.  The SK group has roots stretching back seven decades to
textiles manufacturing.  SK Holdings, the de facto holding company for the group,
rose 1.2 percent to close at 129,500 won in Seoul trading while
the benchmark Kospi index dropped 0.1 percent.  The stock fell 13 percent in 2011, while Kospi declined 11
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
