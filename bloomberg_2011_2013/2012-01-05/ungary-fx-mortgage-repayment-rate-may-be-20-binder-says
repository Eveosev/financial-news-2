As many as 20 percent of  Hungary ’s
eligible borrowers may take advantage of a plan to repay
foreign-currency mortgages at below-market rates, Istvan Binder,
a spokesman for financial regulator PSZAF said.  Banks, which must shoulder the costs of the repayment plan,
had a “big rush” of mortgage holders at the end of the year
when the deadline to notify lenders was due to expire, Binder
said in an interview with state-run M1 television today.  The final tally of repayments may be between 15 and 20
percent of those eligible, Binder said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
