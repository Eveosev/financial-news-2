The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
will make public the agendas, minutes and charters of its
external committees.  The  New York  Fed will post minutes from the committee
meetings within 30 days after each gathering, the regional Fed
bank said in a statement on its  website  today. The step is part
of the New York Fed’s “ongoing efforts to increase
transparency,” the bank said in its statement.  The committees include its Economic Advisory Panel and
Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
