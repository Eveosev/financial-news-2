New York City ’s real estate market
has been so volatile that taxes on property sales dropped to
$982 million in 2010 from $3.3 billion in 2007, making it
difficult for city and transit officials to plan for future
revenue, the  Independent Budget Office  said.  Revenue from so-called transfer taxes increased during the
real estate boom from 2000 through 2007, helping to create
budget surpluses for the city and the  Metropolitan
Transportation Authority , the nonpartisan public budget office
in a report today. Those surpluses became deficits in the past
few years as property values and sales plummeted, the  IBO said .  “The sale of commercial property, which includes rental
apartment buildings with four or more units under the city’s
property transfer tax rules, has been a key to the boom and bust
in transfer-tax revenues,” the report found.  Budget officials and regional transit planners have cited
the trend as a driver of deficits that have forced personnel and
service cuts in the city and the MTA, which has also raised
fares on its subways, buses and commuter rail operations.  “Even if the economy enters into a vigorous recovery, it
is unlikely that the market will support the levels of prices
that were observed during the peak,” the report concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
