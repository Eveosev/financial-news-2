Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  and  CEZ AS (CEZ)  fell,
leading the biggest drop for the Czech stock index in more than
two months, as investors sold riskier assets across Europe on
concern the region’s debt crisis is worsening.  The  PX (PX)  gauge declined 2.8 percent to 901.8 at the end of
trading in Prague, a second day of losses. Austria’s Erste slid
7.6 percent while CEZ, the biggest Czech power utility, fell 3.3
percent, its worst slump since Sept. 23.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the
Czech unit of Societe Generale SA, dropped 1.9 percent.  European stocks and the euro slid as concern banks will
have to raise capital overshadowed a private report showing U.S.
employers boosted payrolls more than predicted. Funding costs
for France and  Hungary  surged in auctions today, and Societe
Generale shares tumbled after the French lender said it plans to
cut about 1,580 jobs.  “Negative sentiment against the financial sector keeps
hammering stock indexes,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at Prague-
based Komercni, wrote in an e-mail to clients today. “The sell-
off in the financial sector strongly hit also the Prague
bourse.”  Czech bonds fell, lifting 10-year  yields (CZGB10YR)  13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, to 3.72 percent, generic government
indexes compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
