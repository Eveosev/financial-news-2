The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  may be headed
for more losses after having a “bearish reversal” year in
2011, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. small-cap stocks rose above
its 2010 intraday high on the first trading day last year, then
finished the year at 740.92, a 5.5 percent decline. That
pattern, called a bearish reversal, was last seen by the index
in 2000, when it slumped as much as 23 percent in the following
year before recovering to end 2001 with a 1 percent rise,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This submits some more pullback in 2012,” Michael Krauss, JPMorgan’s New York-based head of technical research,
wrote in a note to clients late yesterday. The 759-to-786 area,
which he called a “resistance confluence zone” for the index,
is “key,” Krauss said.  The  Russell 2000 , which tracks companies with an average
market value of about $670 million, fell in 2011 as Europe’s
debt crisis prompted investors to seek safety in larger
companies. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) , a measure for the
biggest American companies, was almost unchanged last year while
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , whose constituents’ market
value averages $124 billion, added 5.5 percent.  The  range (RTY)  of 759 to 786 contains 10 “technical
parameters” for the Russell 2000, including the 200-day moving
average, the October peak and the August 2008 intraday top
before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
according to Krauss. The band “will see profit-taking,” he
said.  The Russell 2000 fell 0.1 percent to 746.89 as of 12:44
p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
