in 15 months against the euro as debt-crisis concern deepened
after French borrowing costs increased at the country’s first
bond auction of the year.  The pound also rose against the Swiss franc and the Danish
krone.  France  sold bonds maturing in 2021 at a yield of 3.29

and the gilt market have the upper hand,” Standard Bank Plc
analysts including  Steven Barrow  wrote in an e-mailed research
note today. “For the pound, we target a move to 0.75 for euro-
sterling this year. We would certainly not rule out a bigger
rise if the  euro-zone  crisis escalates significantly.”  The pound strengthened 0.3 percent to 82.60 pence per euro
at 4:12 p.m. London time after reaching 82.55 pence, the

15,000 in the week ended Dec. 31 to 372,000, according to Labor
Department figures today. A separate report from ADP Employer

more than the 178,000 increase forecast by economists in a
Bloomberg survey, and the most since the series began in January
2001.  Economists forecast a Labor Department report tomorrow will
show hiring picked up and joblessness held below 9 percent in
December.  U.K. government bonds today underperformed their German
counterparts, the benchmark for the euro-area debt markets. The
