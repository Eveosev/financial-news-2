Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ,  Brazil ’s second-
biggest nongovernment bank, sold $750 million of five-year
dollar-denominated bonds as it seeks to expand domestic lending.  Banco Bradesco sold the debt today to yield 4.5 percent,
said Marlene Millan, the bank’s director of foreign exchange.  The lender will use the funds raised to make dollar loans
to Brazilian companies, Millan said in an interview in  Sao
Paulo . “We have a lot of demand from Brazilian firms for long-
term financing in foreign currency,” she said.  Investors sought $2 billion worth of the bonds, said Renato Ejnisman, director of Bradesco BBI in Sao Paulo.  Bradesco tapped international debt markets a day after Rio
de Janeiro-based Vale SA., the world’s largest iron-ore miner,
sold $1 billion of 2022 bonds to yield 4.525 percent, following
the government’s $825 million sale of nine-year notes at 3.449
percent.  Standard & Poor’s  gave the Banco Bradesco bonds a rating of
BBB, its second-lowest investment grade, while Moody’s Investors
Service rated them one level higher at Baa1.  BB Securities, Bank of America, Bradesco BBI, BTG Pactual,
Citigroup and HSBC arranged the sale, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
