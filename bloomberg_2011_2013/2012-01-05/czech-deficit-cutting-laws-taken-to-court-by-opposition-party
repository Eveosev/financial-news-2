The Czech  Social Democrats , the
country’s largest opposition party, filed a complaint at the
 Constitutional Court  against several government laws aimed at
cutting the  budget deficit .  The Social Democrats said Prime Minister Petr Necas’
majority coalition restrained the party’s right to properly
debate the legislation when it pushed through a package of bills
in parliament in November. The laws included measures to boost
private savings for retirement and raise the value-added tax on
some goods and services.  “We are proposing to abolish these 14 so-called reform
laws,” Social Democrats Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka said in a
statement in Prague today.  The laws approved last year are part of Necas’ plan to
narrow the public-finance  deficit (EUBDCZ)  to less than the European
Union limit of 3 percent of economic output by 2013. The plan,
which included cuts in spending on public wages and a reduction
of state subsidies, has helped the Czech koruna and government
bonds outperform their Polish and Hungarian peers in 2011.  Lawmakers on Nov. 6 overrode a veto by the upper house,
controlled by the Social Democrats, to increase the lower value-
added  tax rate  on goods and services including food, drugs and
public transportation to 14 percent this year from 10 percent.
The  Finance Ministry  estimates the VAT change to boost budget
revenue by 21.3 billion koruna ($1.1 billion) in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
