World coffee exports rose to 7.78
million bags in November from 7.75 million bags a year earlier,
the  International Coffee Organization  said today in an e-mailed
statement.  In the first two months of the marketing season, which
began Oct. 1, shipments fell 3.3 percent to 15 million bags from
15.5 million a year earlier,  data  from the London-based industry
group show. A bag weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  For the 12-month period through November, exports of
arabica beans climbed 5.7 percent to 67.1 million bags from 63.5
million a year earlier, the ICO said. Robusta shipments rose 15
percent to 36.9 million bags from 32.1 million.  Arabica coffees are favored by specialty roasters such as
Seattle-based Starbucks Corp., and are grown mainly in  Latin
America  and parts of Africa. Robusta beans, used largely for
espresso beverages, are grown mostly in Asia and  Brazil .  To contact the reporters on this story:
