Natural-rubber production in
 Indonesia , the second-largest grower, may increase at a slower
pace this year as a moderate La Nina potentially disrupts
tapping even as more trees are maturing, an industry group said.  Output may rise 6.5 percent to 3.3 million metric tons this
year after gaining 12 percent to 3.1 million tons last year,
said Suharto Honggokusumo,  executive director  at the Rubber
Association of Indonesia.  Exports may gain to 2.8 million tons from 2.6 million tons,
supported by demand from tire makers in the U.S., Japan and
 China , he said by telephone from Jakarta today.  Rubber plunged 36 percent last year on concern the European
sovereign-debt crisis hurt demand. June-delivery futures rose
0.75 percent to 268.2 yen per kilogram ($3,490 a ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 2 p.m. Jakarta time.  “Rubber trees that were replanted in 2007 and 2008 will
start producing this year,” Honggokusumo said. “Demand remains
good, with consumption from  Europe  expected to improve in the
second half.”  Output from the world’s biggest growers, which represent 92
percent of global supply, may rise 3.1 percent to 10.42 million
tons this year, the Association of Natural Rubber Producing
Countries said yesterday. Last year, output increased 6.4
percent to 10.1 million tons, it said, a faster pace than its
November forecast of 5.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
