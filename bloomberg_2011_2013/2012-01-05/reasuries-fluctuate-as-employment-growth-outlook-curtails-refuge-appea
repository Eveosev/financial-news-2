Treasury (YCGT0025)  30-year bonds fell as signs
the employment market is strengthening reduced the appeal of
 U.S. government debt  to investors seeking a refuge.  The long bond dropped after reports showed companies added
more jobs in December than forecast and initial jobless claims
decreased last week. Employment increased at a faster pace last
month, the Labor Department’s payrolls report is forecast to
show. The Treasury announced it will sell $66 billion in notes
and bonds next week.  “Some people are still wrestling with better than expected
economic data in the U.S., and there’s also concern about the
headline risk coming out of  Europe ,” said  Chris Ahrens , head
interest-rate strategist in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at UBS AG,
one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal
Reserve . “There’s tactical trading in Treasuries.”  The yield on the 30-year bond rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.06 percent at 5:07 p.m. in  New York .
The price of the 3.125 percent security due in November 2041
fell 21/32, or $6.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 1/4. The
benchmark 10-year note yield increased two basis points to 2
percent after earlier touching 2.02 percent, the highest since
Dec. 27.  The Treasury announced it will sell $32 billion in three-
year notes, $21 billion in 10-year securities and $13 billion in
30-year bonds in three consecutive days starting Jan. 10.  Trading Activity  The Federal Reserve sold $1.35 billion of Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities due from April 2012 to April 2014
today as part of Operation Twist, according to the New York
Fed’s  website . The central bank is replacing $400 billion of
shorter-maturity Treasuries in its holdings with longer-term
debt to cap borrowing costs and foster economic growth under the
program it announced in September.  Trading activity in shorter-term  Treasury securities  slowed
in the second half of 2011 while trader demand shifted to
higher-yielding longer-term  government securities  as yields fell
to record lows, Fed data shows.  Trading in Treasuries maturing in six years or more rose 12
percent to a weekly average of $186.9 billion in the period from
July 1 to Dec. 21, the last date for which information has been
collected, compared with the first six months of the year.
Trading in Treasury debt due in less than six years fell 10
percent to a weekly average of $300.2 billion, the data show.  Treasuries maturing in 10 or more years returned 26 percent
in the last year months of 2011 compared with a 4.4 percent gain
for government debt maturing in 10 years or less, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch bond indexes show.  About $239 billion of Treasuries  changed hands (ICPTVOL)  today in New
York through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker.
The figure is the highest since Dec. 2. The daily average for
2011 was $285 billion.  ‘Lot of Fear’  U.S. debt securities rose earlier as an increase in
borrowing costs in  Spain , Hungary and  France  added to concern
Europe’s debt crisis is spreading. Spanish five-year notes
extended declines after the government said it will sell a new
three-year benchmark security and 2016 debt on Jan. 12.  “There’s still a lot of fear out there,” said James Combias, New York-based head of Treasury trading at primary
dealer Mizuho Securities USA Inc. “People are paying attention
to Europe.”  The European Financial Stability Facility sold 3 billion
euros ($3.84 billion) of notes due February 2015 and priced to
yield 40 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate,
according to the fund’s statement.  Demand Falls  Investors ordered 4.5 billion euros of the securities,
compared with demand of nine times on its first deal a year ago.
The fund will use the proceeds of today’s transaction to help
finance the bailouts of Ireland and  Portugal .  France sold 7.96 billion euros of debt as borrowing costs
rose in its first auction of the year as credit-rating companies
threaten to cut its AAA ranking.  Hungary  raised less than planned at a bill auction as
yields soared on concern the  International Monetary Fund  and
European Union won’t resume aid talks. They ended discussions
last month as the government prepared legislation that
threatened to undermine the independence of the central bank.  The euro dropped as low as 98.48 yen, the weakest since
December 2000.  Italy’s largest lender, UniCredit SpA, will sell new shares
at a discount because the debt crisis is worsening, Chief
Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  told  Il Sole 24 Ore  in an
interview. He added that he expects other banks raising money to
do the same.  ‘More Capital’  “There are concerns about European banks needing to raise
more capital,” said  Anthony Cronin , a Treasury trader at
primary dealer  Societe Generale  in New York.  Treasuries also strengthened earlier on unconfirmed reports
of troop movements in North Korea amid a change in leadership
from  Kim Jong Il ’s death, increasing speculation of the risk of
conflict.  ADP Employer Services reported that companies added 325,000
jobs last month, compared with a forecast for 178,000 workers in
a Bloomberg News survey of 38 economists. Payrolls increased by
206,000 in November.  The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims
decreased to 372,000 in the week ended Dec. 31. The median
forecast of 38 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
drop to 375,000 from a previously reported 381,000.  A Labor Department report tomorrow is forecast to show the
U.S. added 155,000 jobs, according to the median forecast of 81
economists in a separate Bloomberg News survey, compared with
120,000 in the previous month.  The  unemployment rate  is forecast to rise to 8.7 percent
from 8.6 percent in the previous month, economists said.  The U.S. 10-year yield will increase to 2.69 percent by the
end of 2012, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of banks and securities companies, with the most
recent projections given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
