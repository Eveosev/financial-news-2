Geno Smith threw six touchdown passes
and ran for another to lead  West Virginia University  to a record
70-33 win over  Clemson University  in college football’s Orange
Bowl.  Smith connected four times with Tavon Austin, who had 11
catches for 117 yards at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Shawne
Alston ran for two touchdowns.  Smith tied a bowl record with six touchdown passes and
broke Tom Brady’s Orange Bowl record for passing with 401 yards,
while Austin equaled a bowl record for touchdown receptions.

play set by Baylor in its 67-56 win over Washington at the Alamo
Bowl on Dec. 29.  Mountaineer Darwin Cook recovered a Clemson fumble on the
one-yard line and ran 99 yards for a touchdown in the second
quarter.  Tajh Boyd passed for 250 yards, two touchdowns and two
interceptions for the Tigers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
