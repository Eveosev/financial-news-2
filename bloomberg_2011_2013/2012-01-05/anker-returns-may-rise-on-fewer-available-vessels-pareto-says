Returns for the largest  oil tankers 
hauling Middle East crude to  Asia  may rise after the number of
surplus ships fell to two a cargo, Pareto Securities AS said.  There are between 4 and 6 cargoes left in the  Persian Gulf 
for the second 10-day period in January, with 10 vessels
available to load them, the Oslo-based investment bank said in
an e-mailed report today.  The surplus of tankers competing to load crude from the
gulf shrank to a seven-week low, a Bloomberg survey showed Jan.
3.  Oil companies  hired 140 vessels in December, the most for a
month since at least 2005, according to data from London-based
shipbroker Galbraith’s Ltd. Concern that Iran may disrupt
shipments from the region contributed to the increase,
consultant FACTS Global Energy said Dec. 22.  “We should see some upward pressure on rates in the short
term,” Pareto analysts led by Martin Korsvold said in the
report.  Daily income for very large crude carriers, each able to
haul 2 million barrels of crude, on the benchmark Saudi Arabia-
to-Japan voyage gained 2.6 percent yesterday to $12,597,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange.  Rates (BITRPGJP)  to charter
VLCCs on the route increased 0.5 percent to 49.99 industry-
standard Worldscale points.  The points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or flat
rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually
by the Worldscale Association in  London  to reflect changing fuel
costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
