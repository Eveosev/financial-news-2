Oil fell for the first time in three
days as U.S. inventories gained and borrowing costs in  France 
rose, adding to concern that  Europe  will struggle to contain the
debt crisis.  Oil dropped 1.4 percent, slipping $1.49 in the last 40
minutes of floor trading, after the Energy Department said
 supplies (DOESCRUD)  rose 2.21 million barrels last week. Futures ended
above $100 for a third day on concern that sanctions against
Iran will curb supplies.  “This was clearly a bearish report and this shows the U.S.
market is very well supplied,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in  New York . “If we don’t
trend lower on data like these, it is because the market is
largely focused elsewhere, issues like Iran.”  Crude for February delivery fell $1.41, or 1.4 percent, to
$101.81 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Prices
have gained 28 percent in three months.  Brent oil for February lost 96 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $112.74 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Oil stockpiles (DOESCRUD)  increased to 329.7 million barrels, the
Energy Department report showed. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expected a decline of 1 million barrels.  Total petroleum demand (DOEDTPRD) 
fell 2.6 percent to 18 million barrels a day. Inventories at
 Cushing (DOESCROK) , Oklahoma, the delivery point for futures traded on the
Nymex, dropped to 29.3 million barrels, a two-year low.  Gasoline inventories (DOESTMGS)  rose 2.48 million barrels to 220.2
million.  Distillate fuels (DOESDIST) , which include diesel and heating oil,
gained 3.22 million to 143.6 million. Gains of 1 million barrels
were expected for both.  Euro Declines  The euro weakened as European borrowing costs increased and
 Greece  said income cuts are needed to avoid default. French 10-
year bond yields rose to 3.29 percent from 3.18 percent on Dec.
1. Hungary’s one-year bill yield climbed to the highest level
since 2009.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said deeper income
cuts are the only way for the country to keep the euro and avert
economic collapse, adding to concern that the European crisis
will persist.  The  euro dropped (EURUSD)  as much as 1.3 percent to $1.2777, the
lowest level since September 2010. A weaker euro and stronger
dollar reduce the appeal of investing in oil.  The 27 European Union member states accounted for 16
percent of global oil consumption last year, based on BP Plc’s
Statistical Review of World Energy. The U.S. used 21 percent.  Iran  Sanctions  The European Union countries aim to announce harsher
sanctions on Iran’s energy and banking industries at their next
meeting on Jan. 30,  Michael Mann , an EU spokesman, said in
Brussels yesterday.  French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe  said yesterday he hopes
Europe will decide to embargo Iranian oil as part of sanctions
against the country’s nuclear program. Iran has threatened to
block the Strait of Hormuz, through which almost 20 percent of
the world’s oil flows out of the  Persian Gulf , if its exports
are restricted.  “The prospect of sanctions is having an effect already on
the outright price,” said Alexander Poegl, an analyst at JBC
Energy GmbH in Vienna. “Europe made it clear in November that
they’re quite advanced with the proposals.”  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  questioned the scope and
timing of a possible EU halt to Iranian oil purchases. Penalties
should be phased in and exempt crude sold by Iran to pay off
debts to  Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil company, Monti told
France’s  Le Figaro  in an interview published today.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 518,463
contracts as of 3:22 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 604,724
yesterday versus the three-month average of 609,000. Open
interest was 1.39 million contracts, the highest level since
Nov. 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:
