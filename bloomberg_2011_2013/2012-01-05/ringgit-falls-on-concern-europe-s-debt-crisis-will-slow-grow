Malaysia ’s ringgit snapped a three-
day rally on concern Europe’s lingering debt crisis will slow
growth in Southeast Asia’s third-biggest economy. Government
bonds declined for a second day.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index retreated for a
second day after Italy’s biggest bank, UniCredit SpA, said
yesterday it will sell new shares to raise more capital. The
ringgit touched its strongest level in more than three weeks
earlier after global funds bought 800 million ringgit ($255
million) more local shares than they sold last month, according
to data on the  Kuala Lumpur  stock exchange’s website.  “Concern about Europe’s debt problems remains and that is
impacting the performance of Asian currencies, including the
ringgit,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center
for Economic Research in Tokyo.  The ringgit traded at 3.1380 per dollar as of 4:09 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, compared with 3.1370 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.1290, the
strongest level since Dec. 9.  Singapore, Malaysia’s second-largest export market,
reported this week that its  economy (SGDPQOQ)  shrank for the second time
in three quarters.  The yield on the 3.434 percent debt due August 2014 added
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.04 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
