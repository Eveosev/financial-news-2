Cnooc Ltd. (883)  led a rally in Chinese oil
producers in New York trading, fueling the biggest premiums in a
month over their Hong Kong-listed shares, after the government
raised the threshold of a windfall tax on crude.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  advanced 2.3 percent to a
four-week high of 99.96 as trading closed in New York. Cnooc
surged 6.9 percent, the most among stocks in the measure,
followed by  PetroChina Co. (PTR)  and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) 
The companies’ U.S.-listed stocks are trading at  premiums  of as
much as 4.4 percent over their shares traded in  Hong Kong .  China ’s finance ministry increased the threshold of the
nation’s oil windfall tax to $55 per barrel from $40, effective
Nov. 1, 2011, Sinopec said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The
action is the central government stepping in to offset the
additional resources tax on crude oil sales by provincial
governments in November, according to Gordon Kwan, head of
regional energy research at Mirae Asset Securities HK Ltd.  “The corporate sector in much of the emerging world
actually is in pretty decent shape,”  Philip Poole , head of
investment strategy at HSBC Global Asset Management, said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in Hong Kong. “For
investors who can take a two-year horizon or longer, we think
the entry points in China, places like  Russia  in the emerging
equity markets are very interesting.”  Cnooc’s American depositary receipts, each representing 100
common shares, surged to a one-month high of $196.44. They are
trading at a 4.2 percent premium over Hong Kong-listed shares,
which closed at HK$14.64 yesterday, or $1.89 per share. The gap
was the most since Nov. 30.  Accelerating Imports  China’s imports of crude may accelerate to a record this
year as the world’s second-biggest oil user bolsters emergency
stockpiles and expands refining capacity even as the pace of
economic growth slows. The nation may buy 9 percent more
petroleum from overseas in 2012, according to the median
estimate of seven traders and analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg
News . Purchases rose 6.1 percent in the first 11 months of 2011.  The increase to the windfall tax threshold is “good” for
the major  oil companies , as “anyone operating in China has to
pay this tax. This will encourage more offshore China
exploration as well as onshore,” Kwan at Mirae Asset said.
“The shares of Chinese oil companies should outperform” in the
trading session following the news, he said.  Many analysts lowered their earnings estimates for the oil
companies in November when the provincial tax was implemented,
according to Kwan. These forecasts may now be revised back up to
pre-November levels, he said.  PetroChina Premium  PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil producer, leaped 5.9
percent, the most since May 2010, to $139.62. It traded at a 4.4
percent premium over its stock traded in Hong Kong. China
Petroleum, the second-largest and the biggest oil refiner in the
country known as Sinopec, jumped 5.1 percent to $115.50, the
highest level since February 2008.  The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 1 percent to 2,148.45.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3 percent to 1,281.06.
The Shanghai measure is trading at an estimated price-earnings
ratio of 8.7 times. That compares with 13.8 for Indian stocks,
9.2 for Brazilian shares and 5.4 for Russian equities.  7 Days  7 Days Group Holdings Ltd. (SVN) , the second-largest budget hotel
operator in China, advanced 5.7 percent to $12.16, the most in a
month. The company completed its acquisition of Hunan Huatian
Star Hotel Management Ltd., adding 21 leased-and-operated hotels
across 12 cities in China, it said in a  regulatory filing  Jan.
3. The added business will be reflected in 7 Days’ financial
reporting starting from Dec. 31, 2011, it said.  The ishares FTSE China 25  Index (SPX)  Fund, the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., rose 0.7 percent to $35.69.
The Chinese  yuan  weakened 0.1 percent to 6.3017 per dollar,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  Youku Inc. (YOKU) , the owner of China’s biggest online-video
website, gained 4.3 percent to $16.49. Alicia Yap, a Hong Kong-
based equity analyst at Barclays, maintained an “overweight”
rating on Youku and a 12-month price target of $25 in a note
dated Jan. 4.  Chinese companies’ “TV advertising budgets are shifting to
online video advertising with Youku, the market leader,
appearing well positioned to benefit from the opportunity,” Yap
wrote.  Record Low  Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd. (QIHU) ,  a security software
developer, rebounded from a record low after saying it will
repurchase as much as $50 million of its ADRs, using its cash.
The company had $319 million in cash and cash equivalents on its
balance sheet as of Sept. 30, 2011, it said in a statement
yesterday. The ADRs rose 3.8 percent to $14.51, after sinking to
a record low of $13.98 a day earlier.  George I Askew, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Inc.,
reiterated a “buy”  recommendation  on Qihoo yesterday, cutting
the price target to $31 from $38. Seven of eight analysts rated
the stock a “buy” while one gave it a “hold,” according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  China, the world’s second-largest economy, expanded 9.1
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, down from 9.5
percent growth in the second quarter. Consumer prices rose 4.2
percent in November from a year ago, the slowest pace in 14
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
