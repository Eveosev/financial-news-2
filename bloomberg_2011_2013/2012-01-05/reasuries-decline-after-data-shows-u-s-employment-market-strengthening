Treasuries rose after an increase in
borrowing costs in  Spain , Hungary and France added to concern
Europe’s debt crisis is spreading, boosting demand for the
safest assets.  The yield on the  10-year note (USGG10YR)  earlier rose to the highest
in more than a week after ADP Employer Services reported
companies added more jobs than forecast in December and the
Labor Department said fewer Americans filed claims for
unemployment benefits last week. Italy’s largest lender
announced a share sale because the debt crisis is worsening.  “We’re seeing Spanish spreads blow out and we are the
beneficiaries of that,” said  Anthony Cronin , a Treasury trader
at Societe General in  New York , one of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “That’s overshadowing the
stronger economic news. There are concerns about European banks
needing to raise more capital.”  The  yield (USGG10YR)  on the 10-year note fell 2 basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.96 percent at 10:02 a.m. in New York. The
price of the 2 percent securities due November 2021 rose 7/32,
or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 13/32. It touched 2.019
percent, the highest since Dec. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
