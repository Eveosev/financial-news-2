SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , a
maker of machines that carbonate tap water, rose after saying it
would team with  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  to offer fizzy versions of
beverages including Crystal Light and Country Time lemonade.  SodaStream, based in Airport City, Israel,  advanced (SODA)  4.7
percent to $39.54 at 4 p.m. in New York. Kraft rose 0.9 percent
to $37.74.  The agreement, covering the production, marketing,
distribution and sale of Kraft flavors, is the first time the
Northfield, Illinois-based company has used its brands in
carbonated drinks, the companies said today in a statement.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  “Branded offerings will help improve consumer awareness of
the SodaStream product,”  Mitchell Pinheiro , an analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, wrote today in a
note to clients. The partnership “provides an element of
credibility to this relatively nascent stage, at-home soda-
making trend in the U.S.” He rates SodaStream “buy.”  The Kraft flavors will be sold in stores starting in the
second quarter, the companies said. Consumers add flavors, such
as diet cola and cream soda, to water they’ve carbonated with
SodaStream’s machines.  The pact may serve as a model for future deals since
SodaStream “has been actively pursuing potential co-branding
partnerships,” Joseph Altobello, an analyst at Oppenheimer &
Co. in  New York , wrote today in a note. He rates the stock
“outperform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
