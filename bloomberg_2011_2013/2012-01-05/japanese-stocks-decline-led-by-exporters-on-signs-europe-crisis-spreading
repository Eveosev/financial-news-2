Japanese  stocks (TPX)  fell, driving down
the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  the most in more than two weeks, on
signs  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  Olympus Corp. (7733) , the
camera maker mired in an accounting scandal, rebounded.  Canon Inc. (7751) , which depends on Europe for almost a third of
its sales, lost 1.2 percent after the euro fell to an 11-year
low against the yen. Elpida Memory Inc. sank 7.4 percent on a
report the chipmaker, facing $1.6 billion in bond redemptions
and loan payments, is seeking financial support from other
companies. Olympus rallied 4.4 percent after Michael Woodford’s
spokesman said the former chief executive is meeting investors
to discuss forming a new board at the scandal-mired camera maker.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.8 percent to 8,488.71
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, the steepest drop since Dec. 19.
The broader Topix lost 0.9 percent to 736.28. Shares slipped
after Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said  Greece  is at “risk of
a disorderly default” and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s biggest bank,
yesterday said it will sell shares at a discount to plug a
capital shortfall.  “It reminds investors that there isn’t an easy solution to
Europe’s problems,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist
in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co. which oversees
the equivalent of $84 billion. “Euro weakness is having impact
on the market today.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.2 percent
today. The gauge closed little changed yesterday in  New York ,
shrugging off negative news from Europe amid signs of recovery
in the world’s largest economy.  U.S. Buoying Markets  The International Council of Shopping Centers yesterday
said U.S. retail sales may have risen last month more than
initially expected and Ford Motor Co. reported December sales
that beat analysts’ estimates.  “The U.S. real economy is firmer than people thought,”
said Ishigane at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset. “That’s buoying
markets.”  An improving U.S. economy may drive an 18 percent gain in
the benchmark Nikkei 225 to about 10,000 by the end of June,
according to Shun Maruyama, a Tokyo-based strategist at BNP
Paribas SA. A boost in demand as  Japan  rebuilds from the March
11 earthquake and tsunami will also lift stocks, Maruyama wrote
in a report today.  Japanese shares slipped today after the euro fell to as low
as 99.05 yen today in  Tokyo , its weakest since December 2000.
Europe’s shared currency slid as UniCredit’s share offer spurred
concern the region’s banks may struggle to raise capital. The
bank said it will sell shares at 43 percent less than
yesterday’s closing price, excluding the value of rights.  ‘Risking Disorderly Default’  Prime Minister Papademos yesterday asked Greeks to accept
deeper pay cuts so that the country’s creditors will agree to
provide more financing. Without an agreement, Greece “faces the
immediate risk of a disorderly default,” he said according to an
e-mailed transcript of statements to union and business leaders.  Japanese exporters of electronics that depend on European
sales declined. Canon slid 1.2 percent to 3,390 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,
which earns more than 20 percent of its revenue in Europe, lost
2.2 percent to 1,373 yen.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Japanese  market (NKY)  today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  Silicon wafer makers:  Sumco Corp. (3436)  (3436 JT) retreated 2.9
percent to 564 yen, while  Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. (4063)  (4063 JT) fell
1.8 percent to 3,790 yen after website PVinsights.com said the
price of poly-silicon jumped 4.5 percent from last week amid
anti-dumping probes.  Steelmakers:  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  (5411 JT) paced declines
among steelmaker after the Nikkei newspaper reported  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  asked steelmakers for a cut of about 5,000 yen a ton
for the half-year ending in March. Steel prices will fall by the
biggest margin since fiscal 2009 if Toyota gets its way, the
report said. JFE fell 2.2 percent to 1,387 yen.  Nippon Steel
Corp. (5401)  (5401 JT) lost 2.1 percent to 191 yen.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665)  (6665 JT) tumbled 7.4 percent to 350 yen.
The money-losing chipmaker sought $500 million in support from
10 companies in the U.S., Taiwan and  China , the Yomiuri
newspaper reported without citing anyone. Elpida declined to
comment in an email.  Olympus Corp. (7733 JT), the camera maker reeling from a
$1.7 billion accounting fraud, rallied 4.4 percent to 1,031 yen
after Woodford’s spokesman, Waku Miller, said the former CEO has
returned to Japan to meet investors over a possible proxy fight.  Point Inc. (2685)  (2685 JT), an apparel chain, slipped 3.5 percent
to 3,150 yen. The retailer said domestic same-store sales fell
0.4 percent in December from a year earlier, driven by lower
customer traffic.  Taiyo Yuden Co. (6976)  (6976 JT): The maker of electronic
components gained 2 percent to 605 yen after the Nikkei quoted
company president Eiji Watanuki as saying the company aims to
exceed 10 billion yen in operating profit in the year ending
March 2013.  TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. (5012)  (5012 JT) plummeted 7.2 percent to
735 yen, falling for a second day after Reuters yesterday
reported that parent Exxon Mobile Corp. plans to sell most of
its stake in the refiner. TonenGeneral plans to pay 200 billion
yen to buy back more than 30 percent of its own shares from
Exxon, which holds 50.02 percent, the Nikkei reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
