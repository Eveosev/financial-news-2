Copper fell for the second straight
day on concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is deepening, eroding
prospects for the economy and metal demand.  European industrial orders rose less than forecast in
October from the previous month, regional statistics showed. The
 euro (EURUSD)  dropped to the lowest in almost 16 months against the
dollar after French borrowing costs rose at a bond sale.  “We are experiencing more euro-sourced angst, pressuring
metals and energy in the process,”  Edward Meir , an analyst at
INTL FCStone Inc. in  New York , said in a report.  Copper futures for March delivery declined 0.2 percent to
close at $3.4265 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Yesterday, the most-active contract slumped 2.7 percent, the
most in three weeks, amid signs of faltering manufacturing and
 service industries  in Europe.  Service industries in the U.S., the world’s second-largest
copper user, expanded less than forecast in December, indicating
improvement in the economy may be sluggish. China is the top
metal buyer.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months was unchanged at $7,540 a metric ton ($3.42 a pound).  Lead, zinc, aluminum and nickel fell in London. Tin
climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
