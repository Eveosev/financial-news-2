A Japanese sushi chain will take a
more than $600,000 loss on the most expensive fish ever sold at
 Tokyo ’s Tsukiji market as it sells $74 pieces of tuna for $5
apiece.  Kiyomura K.K. paid a record 56 million yen ($730,000) for
the fish at the market’s first auction in 2012. Chefs carved it
into about 10,000 pieces of sushi that were sold at the
restaurants’ normal prices of between 134 yen and 418 yen
instead of the 5,649 yen needed for the chain to break even.  “It is not just about the money, as there will be positive
ripple effects from buying the fish,” said Hiroshi Umehara a
spokesman for the chain. “It is also about the Japanese
spirit.”  Foreign companies have outbid Kiyomura at the auction in
the past three years, according to Umehara. Japanese eat more
fish per capita than any other developed country, consuming 56.7
kilograms (128 pounds) annually, compared with a global average
of 17.1 kilograms, according to the United Nation’s Food and
Agriculture Organization. Fish accounts for 23 percent of
protein in the daily Japanese diet, compared with four percent
in the U.S.  “We really wanted to provide good tuna to the locals after
losing to overseas rivals in the past three years,” said
Umehara. “We don’t think this is a proper price.”  The price Kiyomura paid for the first tuna of the year,
touted as an auspicious prize, also comes to 210,000 yen per
kilogram, compared with the 14,962 yen per kilogram highest
price paid for Dec. 29 and the 26,932 yen maximum on Dec. 30.  Japanese ‘Stamina’  “The purchase shows that Japanese companies still have
stamina,” Masao Morita, Sony Pictures Entertainment  Japan 
representative director, said today in Tokyo at a New Year’s
party for Keidanren, the nation’s most influential business
lobby. “It’s not just about the cost, it’s about added-value.”  The tuna offered at the first auction of the year over the
past 15 years at the Tsukiji fish market sold for an average
11.8 million yen, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Central
Wholesale Market website. The previous record price was set last
year at 32.5 million yen, the market’s data shows.  “We would definitely like to be one of the companies to be
able to make such a winning bid,” Takeshi Niinami, president of
Lawson Inc., Japan’s second-biggest convenience store chain,
said at the Keidanren event.  4 a.m. Fish Market  Tsukiji is listed among Japan’s most popular attractions by
the Japan National Tourism Organization. An estimated 500
visitors a day gather as early as 4 a.m. at the market to
observe tuna auctions, where buyers use hand signals to bid for
fish that are later sliced with meter-long carbon-steel knives.
Tsukiji, the size of 43 football fields, is crammed with stalls
selling giant crabs, bright red octopus, and fugu, a type of
blow fish that is deadly if incorrectly prepared.  Tokyo boasts the most Michelin stars of any city in the
world, with more of the coveted awards than Paris and  New York 
combined. At Sushiyabashi Jiro, which has three stars, a course
can cost more 35,000 yen ($460).  To contact the reporter on this story:
