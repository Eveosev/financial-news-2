Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the worst
performer in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  last year, had
profit estimates cut by analysts at Citigroup Inc. and KBW Inc.
this week on higher projected losses for soured mortgages.  The lender may have $12 billion to $32 billion in further
costs tied to buying back defective loans and settling  lawsuits (BAC) 
over the next three years,  Keith Horowitz  of Citigroup said
today in a research note. He trimmed his per-share 2012 profit
estimate to 50 cents from 75 cents and lowered the 2013 figure
to 90 cents from $1.20.  Bank of America Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan 
sold more than $30 billion in assets last year and announced $5
billion in annual expense savings to bolster capital. The
second-biggest U.S. lender’s shares plunged 58 percent in 2011
as investors speculated the bank will have to issue new stock
ahead of stricter international rules on capital.  “The wild card for the stock remains how the regulators
view this potential liability and how quickly they will require
Bank of America to refill the  capital hole (BAC) ,” said Horowitz, who
added that heightened mortgage costs were probably manageable
without issuing new shares. “At current levels, the stock price
is implying a large capital raise.”  Horowitz, who has a “buy”  recommendation (BAC)  on Bank of
America, raised his estimate for the fourth quarter to 36 cents
from 14 cents because of gains from asset sales, including a
stake in China Construction Bank Corp.  Mortgage costs may drive a 3-cent-per-share operating loss
in the fourth quarter of 2011,  Jefferson Harralson  of KBW said
in a Jan. 2 research note. By his own reckoning, Harralson’s was
the most pessimistic of estimates from analysts, most of whom
expect  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America to report
a profit when it posts results on Jan. 19.  Loan repurchase costs may surge to $1 billion in the fourth
quarter from $275 million in the previous three-month period,
Harralson said. He rates the bank “market perform.” KBW is
projecting earnings at 70 cents a share for 2012 and 10 cents in
2013.  Bank of America  rose (BAC)  3.6 percent to $6.02 as of 11:25 a.m.
in New York, the highest since Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
