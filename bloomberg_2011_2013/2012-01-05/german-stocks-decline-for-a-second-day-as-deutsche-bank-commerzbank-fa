German stocks (DAX)  fell for a second day
as banks retreated amid concern they will have to raise more
capital, overshadowing a report showing that companies in the
U.S. added more workers than economists had predicted.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s largest
lenders, declined more than 4 percent.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) 
dropped 2.8 percent after Credit Suisse Group AG cut its rating.
 Metro AG (MEO) ,  Germany’s largest retailer (MEO) , slipped 0.8 percent as the
nation’s consumer spending declined.  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Volkswagen
AG (VOW)  paced gains among European carmakers.  The benchmark DAX Index lost 0.3 percent to 6,095.99 at the
close in Frankfurt, extending yesterday’s 0.9 percent slide. The
broader HDAX Index slipped 0.2 percent today.  “Even if  Europe  can avoid a sovereign-debt collapse, the
deleveraging by the European banking system is likely to produce
at least a mild recession in 2012,”  Russ Koesterich , the San
Francisco-based global chief investment strategist at the
IShares unit of BlackRock Inc., wrote in a note today.  France  sold 7.96 billion euros ($10.2 billion) of debt
today as borrowing costs rose. The government sold 4.02 billion
euros of benchmark 10-year bonds at an average yield of 3.29
percent from 3.18 percent in an auction on Dec. 1. The nation
also borrowed debt maturing in 2023, 2035 and 2041.  In  Greece , Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said after
European markets closed yesterday that the country faces a
disorderly default as soon as March if it doesn’t accept steeper
income cuts to secure further financing from international
creditors.  U.S. Private Payrolls  American companies added 325,000 workers in December, more
than economists had forecast, adding to evidence the labor
market was gaining momentum heading into 2012, figures from the
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer Services showed.  Applications for  U.S. jobless benefits (INJCJC)  decreased by 15,000
to 372,000 in the week ended Dec. 31, Labor Department figures
showed today. The  median estimate (INJCJC)  of 38 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey predicted 375,000 claims.  Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank dropped 5.6 percent to 27.97
euros and 4.5 percent to 1.22 euros, respectively. Bank stocks
were the worst performers of the 19 industry groups in the
benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) .  HeidelbergCement (HEI)  fell 2.8 percent to 33.61 euros as Credit
Suisse downgraded the cement producer to “underperform” from
“outperform.”  Metro dropped 0.8 percent to 29.09 euros. German retail
sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, decreased 0.9
percent in November, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said today. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey had forecast a
gain of 0.2 percent.  Brenntag Drops  Brenntag AG (BNR)  fell 1.2 percent to 71.40 euros, dropping for a
second day. Brachem Acquisition SCA sold an 8.7 percent stake in
the chemical distributor for about 315 million euros.  Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ)  sank 3.6 percent to 19.68 euros.
Commerzbank cut the shares of the generic drugmaker to “add”
from “buy,” while Jefferies Group Inc. lowered its
recommendation to “hold” from “buy.”  Daimler and Volkswagen added 1.4 percent to 36.89 euros and
2.6 percent to 126.20 euros, respectively, following gains among
European carmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
