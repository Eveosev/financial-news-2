European stock futures were little
changed before a French bond sale and a report that may show the
American service industry grew the fastest in three months. U.S.
index futures and Asian shares declined.  Futures on the  Euro Stoxx 50 Index (SX5E)  expiring in March lost
0.1 percent to 2,344 at 7:02 a.m. in  London , while FTSE 100
Index futures advanced 0.2 percent. The March contract on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.2 percent. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index retreated 0.6 percent.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index yesterday retreated
from a five-month high on concern that the region’s banks will
need to raise more capital to weather the sovereign-debt crisis.  France  plans to sell as much as 8 billion euros ($10.4
billion) of debt today in the country’s first test this year of
investor appetite for its bonds amid threats of a downgrade of
its AAA rating by credit-rating companies.  Service industries  in the U.S. probably grew in December at
the fastest pace in three months, showing the economy picked up
as 2011 drew to a close, economists said before a report today.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing industries, which account for about 90 percent of
the economy, rose to 53 from 52 in November, according to the
median projection of 65 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The number of applications for jobless benefits fell last week,
another report may show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
