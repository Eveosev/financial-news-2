Job cuts announced by U.S. employers
increased in December from the prior year’s decade low.  Planned firings (CHALTOTL)  rose 31 percent to 41,785 last month from
32,004 in December 2010, which were the fewest since June 2000,
according to Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Job
cuts totaled 606,082 for all of 2011, up 14 percent from the
previous year, the report showed.  Government and financial services accounted for four of
every 10 announcements last year, and the areas will probably
struggle this year as federal agencies try to reduce budget
deficits and the European debt crisis threatens to cut off
credit, the report said. At the same time, the year’s total was
less than half the recession peak of 1.29 million firings
announced in 2009.  “While several other sectors saw increased job cuts, the
pace of downsizing in most industries is still well below
recession levels,” John A. Challenger, chief executive officer
of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. “But even
as job cuts remain low in most sectors, employers still appear
reluctant to add jobs.  Job creation  is likely to remain slow and
steady in 2012.”  Compared with November, job-cut announcements decreased 1.6
percent, dropping to the lowest level since June. Because the
figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal effects, economists prefer
to focus on year-over-year changes rather than monthly numbers.  Financial institutions led the December job cuts with 7,433
announced reductions, according to Challenger. Industrial goods
producers followed with 6,621.  Government, Banks  Throughout all of 2011, government agencies cut 183,064
positions, the most in data going back to 2002. Financial
institutions planned to fire 63,624 employees last year, almost
three times the total in 2010.  New York  led all states with 10,000 announced job cuts last
month, followed by  Minnesota  with 4,713. Employers in the
 District of Columbia  announced the most job reductions during
2011, trimming headcounts by 98,676. California was second with
62,500.  Today’s report also showed that employers announced plans
in December to hire 14,074 workers, down from 63,527 the prior
month, as holiday staffing drew to a close.  Employers probably expanded payrolls by 150,000 workers in
December as the jobless rate climbed 8.7 percent from 8.6
percent, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. The Labor Department will release the
figures tomorrow.  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose jobs are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
