The euro fell to an 11-year low
against the yen and the weakest level in 15 months versus the
dollar on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening and as
reports showed the U.S. labor market is strengthening.  The 17-nation currency weakened against most major peers
after  France ’s borrowing costs rose at a bond sale today as
 credit-rating  companies threaten to cut the nation’s top AAA
ranking. Sterling strengthened to a 15-month high versus the
euro. The Australian and New Zealand dollars dropped against the
greenback for a second day as investors sought safer assets.  “Europe trumps better U.S. data right now,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at the online currency trader
GFT Forex in New York. “The market is very concerned about the
sovereign debt and also the bank debt on the European side.
Sentiment is very dour.”  The euro fell 0.7 percent to 98.63 yen at 5 p.m.  New York 
time, after reaching 98.48 yen earlier, its weakest since
December 2000. It dropped 1.2 percent to $1.2789, tumbling below
$1.28 for the first time since Sept. 13, 2010, and touching
$1.2771. The dollar appreciated 0.5 percent to 77.12 yen.  The pound rose to its highest level against the euro since
September 2010, reaching 82.50 pence before trading at 82.53
pence, up 0.4 percent. It depreciated 0.8 percent to $1.5495.  ‘Significant Downside Risk’  “The market is very cognizant and has been for quite some
time that there’s some very significant downside risk as far as
the euro is concerned,”  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10
foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, said
today during an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the
Loop” with Betty Liu. “Increasingly they’re putting their
money where their thoughts are. You’re seeing the euro really
trade quite weak against a host of currencies.”  A 7.5 billion-euro ($9.7 billion) share offer announced
yesterday by UniCredit SpA,  Italy ’s biggest bank, spurred
concern European banks may struggle to raise more capital to
weather the sovereign-debt crisis. UniCredit owns about 39
billion euros of Italian  government bonds .  The dollar extended gains versus the euro after ADP
Employer Services reported U.S. companies added 325,000 workers
in December, beating the highest projection in a Bloomberg News
survey and following a revised 204,000 gain the prior month. The
median estimate was for a gain of 178,000. A government report
tomorrow will show U.S. nonfarm payrolls swelled by 155,000
positions last month, compared with a gain of 120,000 in
November, according to another Bloomberg survey.  U.S. Jobless Claims  Initial claims for  jobless benefits (INJCJC)  in the U.S. decreased
15,000 in the week ended Dec. 31 to 372,000, Labor Department
data showed. The median estimate in a Bloomberg poll forecast
375,000 claims.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing industries, which account for about 90 percent of
the economy, rose to 52.6 in December from 52 a month earlier. A
Bloomberg poll forecast the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s measure
would rise to 53. Fifty is the dividing line between contraction
and expansion.  The euro dropped as France sold 4.02 billion euros of
benchmark 10-year bonds at an average yield of 3.29 percent,
compared with 3.18 percent at a sale on Dec. 1. The 10-year debt
bid-to-cover ratio, or the number of bids received for each unit
of debt sold, fell to 1.64 from 3.05. In all, France auctioned
7.96 billion euros of debt today, including bonds maturing in
2023, 2035 and 2041.  France’s credit outlook was lowered by  Fitch Ratings  on
Dec. 16 on the “heightened risk of contingent liabilities”
from the escalating euro-region crisis.  ‘Not in the Mood’  “There are more downgrade rumors doing the rounds,” said
 Jeremy Stretch , executive director of foreign-exchange strategy
at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London . “So while
France may have passed this hurdle, the market is not in the
mood to give the euro any credit.”  S&P is reviewing the top ratings of both France and  Germany 
and said last month that the euro zone’s rescue fund, the
European Financial Stability Facility, may lose its top credit
rating should one of its AAA rated guarantors, which include
France and Germany, be downgraded.  The Australian dollar fell against its U.S. counterpart
after a report showed the nation’s  trade surplus (AUITGSB)  unexpectedly
narrowed in November as shipments abroad of resources slowed.  Exports exceeded imports by A$1.38 billion ($1.4 billion),
from a revised A$1.42 billion surplus in October, the Bureau of
Statistics said. That compared with the median estimate for a
surplus of A$1.65 billion.  The Aussie weakened 1 percent to $1.0264, while  New
Zealand ’s dollar dropped 0.9 percent to 78.08 U.S. cents.  Forint Pares Losses  Hungary ’s forint slid to a record low against the euro
before paring losses after the government said it’s ready to
discuss conditions for an International Monetary Fund loan and
wants to reach a deal quickly.  Talks for Hungary’s second bailout in four years broke down
last month as Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  refused to abandon a
central bank law that the EU said threatens the monetary
authority’s independence.  The forint appreciated 0.5 percent to 318.90 per euro after
earlier touching 324.24, its weakest level ever.  To contact the reporter on this story:
