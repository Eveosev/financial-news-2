Former England manager  Steve McClaren 
has rejoined  FC Twente  as head coach on a 2 1/2-year contract,
the Dutch soccer said on its website today.  The 50-year-old succeeds Co Adriaanse, who was fired this
week with the club lying in third place in the Dutch league at
the mid-season break.  McLaren first joined Twente in June 2008, seven months
after being fired as coach of England’s national team when the
squad failed to qualify for that year’s European Championship.
After leading Twente to its first Dutch Eredivisie title in
2010, McLaren joined Bundesliga club Wolfsburg.  His stint as the first English manager in  Germany ’s top
league didn’t last long. In February 2011, he was fired as
Wolfsburg struggled to avoid relegation. In June, McLaren was
hired to coach English second-tier club Nottingham Forest, only
to resign in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
