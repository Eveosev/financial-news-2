Asian  stocks (MXAP)  retreated, snapping a
two-day rally, after Australia’s services industry shrank and
the euro weakened ahead of a French bond auction today of as
much as 8 billion euros ($10.4 billion).  Sony Corp. (6759) , a Japanese electronics maker that gets 21
percent of its sales from Europe, fell 2.2 percent as a weaker
euro cut the earnings outlook for exporters. Elpida Memory Inc.
sank slumped 7.4 percent on a report the chipmaker is seeking
financial support from other companies as it faces $1.6 billion
in bond redemptions and loan payments.  National Australia Bank (NAB) 
Ltd. led declines among Australian lenders on a report that the
country’s services industry contracted in December.  “Problems sparked by the European debt crisis are
reigniting,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600
million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “That’s
weakening the euro and hurting exporters with a heavy reliance
on Europe.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.8 percent to 115.6 as
of 7:59 p.m. in Tokyo, with five stocks falling for every three
that rose. The measure climbed 2.4 percent in the first two
trading days of this year as manufacturing growth from the U.S.,
Australia,  China  and India added to signs the global economy may
withstand Europe’s debt crisis.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 0.8 percent and
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 1.1 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi Index fell 0.1 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index
slipped 1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.5 percent.  ‘Disorderly Default’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.8
percent today. The gauge closed little changed yesterday in  New
York , paring an earlier loss of as much as 0.7 percent, as
improving sales at retailers and carmakers helped offset lower-
than-forecast factory orders.  Global stocks declined today as UniCredit SpA, Italy’s
largest bank, said it will sell new shares in a 7.5 billion-euro
($9.8 billion) offer to strengthen its capital position and
Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said Greece is at risk of a
“disorderly default.”  “It reminds investors that there isn’t an easy solution to
 Europe ’s problems,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist
in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversee
the equivalent of $84 billion. “Euro weakness is having an
impact on the market today.”  France  plans to sell as much as 8 billion euros of debt
today. This year’s first test of investors’ appetite for the
bonds comes amid warnings from credit companies France may lose
its AAA rating.  Exporters Drop  Asian exporters declined as the euro dropped toward an 11-
year low against the yen and fell to a four-month low against
the won. A weaker euro cuts the value of European income at
Japanese and South Korean companies when repatriated.  Sony dropped 2.2 percent to 1,373 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera
maker that depends on Europe for almost a third of its sales,
lost 1.2 percent to 3,390 yen.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the
world’s second-largest maker of mobile phones by sales, sank 2.3
percent to 1.055 million won in Seoul.  The Asian benchmark index lost 17 percent in 2011 as China
took steps to cool its  property market  and Europe struggled to
resolve its debt crisis. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index broke
even for the year and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 11
percent. Stocks in the Asian gauge were valued at 12.2 times
 estimated earnings (MXAP)  on average as of yesterday, compared with
12.1 times for the  S&P 500  and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  Elpida tumbled 7.4 percent to 350 yen in Tokyo, the biggest
decline on the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index. (MXAP)  The loss-making
chipmaker is seeking $500 million in financial support from
other companies as it faces $1.6 billion in bond redemptions and
loan payments, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information. Elpida declined to comment in an
e-mail.  Services Contraction  Australian retailers and banks fell after the services
industry contracted for a third straight month. Harvey Norman
Holdings Ltd., a seller of housewares and electronics, lost 1.1
percent to A$1.86. National Australia Bank, the country’s
fourth-largest lender by market value, dropped 1.9 percent to
A$23.73.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  lost 1.3
percent to A$20.74.  TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. (5012)  slumped 7.2 percent to 735 yen.
Shares fell a second day after Reuters reported that parent
Exxon Mobil Corp. plans to sell most of its stake in the
Japanese refiner. Talks about a reorganization are continuing,
said Kosuke Kai, a Japan-based spokesman for Exxon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
