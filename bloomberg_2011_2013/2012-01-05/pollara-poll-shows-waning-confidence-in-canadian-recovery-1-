Canadians have become less confident
the country’s economy has emerged from recession and will
improve in 2012, according to an annual Economic Club of
Canada/Pollara Strategic Insights poll released today.  The share of Canadians who say they expect the economy to
improve over the next 12 months has fallen to 25 percent, from
38 percent a year ago and 54 percent in December 2009, according
to the poll. The percentage of Canadians who believe the
country’s economy is in a recession has increased to 70 percent,
from 65 percent a year earlier.  “This year’s results are the most pessimistic in 16 years
across all the indicators that we have been testing since
1985,” Michael Marzolini, chairman of Pollara, said at an
economic conference in Toronto.  Pollara’s online poll of 2,878 Canadians, taken between
Dec. 1 and Dec. 7, has a margin of error of 1.8 percentage
points, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
