Georgian anti-government protesters
clashed today with police after blockading the state television
headquarters overnight, opposition leader Nino Burjanadze said.  The police used rubber bullets and tear gas and at least
one seriously injured woman was taken to hospital, Burjanadze, a
former speaker of parliament, said in an interview.  Police denied using tear gas and said the demonstrators
attacked a police car with sticks, Shota Utiashvili, an Interior
Ministry spokesman, said by telephone.  The protesters are seeking to oust President Mikheil Saakashvili, a one-time ally of Burjanadze whom the opposition
accuses of manipulating elections. Saakashvili opponents last
staged a major rally in 2009.  U.S.-backed Saakashvili, 43, swept to power in the so-
called Rose Revolution in 2003. He has been under pressure since
2007, when protests turned violent as opponents accused him of
political persecution and failing to raise  living standards .  To contact the reporter on this story:
