Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-
biggest bank, plans to raise about 5.3 billion euros ($7.5
billion) selling new shares to help repay state aid.  Commerzbank will sell 2.44 billion new shares at 2.18 euros
apiece, the Frankfurt-based bank said today in a statement.
Shareholders will be allowed to subscribe to 10 new shares for
every 11 already held from May 24 to June 6, the company said.
New shares are expected to trade on June 7.  Chief Executive Officer  Martin Blessing  announced plans in
April to repay about 14.3 billion euros by June through the sale
of new shares and use of excess reserves. Commerzbank received
more than 18 billion euros from the German government after
agreeing to acquire unprofitable competitor  Dresdner Bank  two
weeks before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Commerzbank shares rose 0.7 percent to 3.95 euros in
Frankfurt trading on May 20. The stock has fallen 29 percent so
far this year, compared with larger German rival Deutsche Bank
AG’s 6.1 percent gain, hurt by the dilution from the capital
increase and its exposure to sovereign debt, Merck Finck & Co.
analyst  Konrad Becker  said on May 16.  Commerzbank has said it is seeking to raise a total of 11
billion euros, with 8.25 billion euros coming from investors and
2.75 billion euros from Germany’s bank-rescue fund Soffin, which
will maintain its stake of 25 percent plus one share in the
company. Soffin will spend about 1.3 billion euros on new
shares, Commerzbank said today.  Allianz SE will fully participate in the rights offer,
according to the Frankfurt bank.  The bank on April 14 said it raised 5.7 billion euros in
the first step, helped by the sale of conditional mandatory
exchangeable notes, leaving another 5.3 billion euros to be
raised in the rights offer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
