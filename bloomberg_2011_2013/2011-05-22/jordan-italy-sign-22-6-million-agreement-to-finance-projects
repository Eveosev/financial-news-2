Jordan and  Italy  signed a 16 million
euros ($22.6 million) debt swap agreement today, Finance
Minister Mohammad Abu Hammour said.  Italy agreed to allocate 8 million euros to finance
development projects, to be chosen by a joint committee by both
countries, Abu Hammour said in an e-mailed statement. The other
8 million euros will be used to fund additional projects to be
listed in the state budget in the coming years, after reaching
an agreement with the Italian side, he said.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the Middle East,
imports more than 90 percent of its oil and relies on foreign
investment and grants to finance its budget and current-account
deficit. Jordan’s public debt increased slightly to 4.617
billion dinars by end of March from 4.610 billion dinars at the
end of 2010, according to figures posted on the ministry’s
website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
