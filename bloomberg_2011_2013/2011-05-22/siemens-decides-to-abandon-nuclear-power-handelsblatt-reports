Siemens AG (SIE)  has decided to abandon
nuclear power after the reactor accident in  Japan ’s Fukushima
plant damaged market potential,  Handelsblatt said , citing
unidentified people close to the company.  Siemens, which originally planned to become the market
leader in atomic power along with  Russia ’s Rosatom Corp., is
struggling with its about-face as snubbing its partner may lead
to negative effects on the company’s business in Russia, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
