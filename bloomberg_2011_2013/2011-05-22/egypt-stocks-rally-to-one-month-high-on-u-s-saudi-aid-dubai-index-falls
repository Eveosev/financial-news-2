Egypt’s shares gained the most in
almost two months after the U.S. and Saudi Arabia pledged $6
billion for the North African country as it recovers from a
popular uprising that ousted its president.  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (OTLD)  surged to the highest level
since October after Deutsche Bank AG raised the country’s
biggest mobile-phone operator to “buy.” Ezz Steel soared 6
percent. The  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  climbed 3 percent, the most since
March 29, to 5,405.52 at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The gauge
has declined 24 percent so far this year.  Saudi Arabia’s $4 billion in aid will be granted in “soft
loans, deposits and grants,” state-run Saudi Press Agency said
yesterday, citing a statement by Egyptian Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, ruling military council head. U.S. President
Barack Obama on May 19 pledged support, including $1 billion in
loan guarantees, and canceling $1 billion in debt.  “The money coming in from the U.S. and  Saudi Arabia  is
definitely affecting the market positively,” said Ashraf Akhnoukh, senior equity-sales trader at Cairo-based Commercial
International Brokerage. “It gives the government space to
breathe, regardless of where the money will be spent.”  The economy has suffered from inflation, a lack of
investment, a budget deficit and decline in tourism since the
uprising, Mohamed ElBaradei, a possible candidate for the
Egyptian presidency, said in remarks to CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria
GPS.” Economic growth may slow to 1 percent this year, the
lowest rate in almost two decades, the International Monetary
Fund said April 11. Former President  Hosni Mubarak  ceded interim
authority to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces on Feb. 11.  ‘Buy’ Rating  The yield on  Egypt ’s 5.75 percent note due April 2020
tumbled 33 basis points, or 0.33 percentage point, to 5.86
percent on May 19, the least since Jan. 25, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate gained one basis point to 5.87
percent on May 20.  The cost of protecting government debt against default for
five years fell 30 basis points to 322 basis points on May 19,
according to CMA prices in London. They were at 325 on May 20.  Orascom Telecom rallied 4.1 percent to 4.54 Egyptian
pounds. The company’s global depositary receipts were assigned a
12-month price estimate of $4.20 at Deutsche Bank. One GDR
represents five ordinary shares of Orascom Telecom, according to
Bloomberg data.  Ezz Steel (ESRS) , Egypt’s largest producer of the
metal, soared to 10.91 pounds, the highest since April 6.  Saudi Gains  Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  increased 0.3
percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of Persian Gulf stocks rose
0.1 percent and Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  gained 0.3 percent. Kuwait’s
measure increased 0.2 percent. Bahrain’s BB All Share Index lost
0.5 percent. In the United Arab Emirates, the  DFM General Index (DFMGI) 
and Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  each dropped 0.3 percent.  Israel’s TA-25 Index slid 1.5 percent, the most since Feb.
24, to 1,273.97 after Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made little effort to disguise their differences over
the borders of a future Palestinian state after a two-hour
meeting at the White House on May 20.  “There is a lack of conviction with buyers,” said Omri
Weissman, head of stock trading at Excellence Nessuah Investment
House Ltd. in Ramat Gan,  Israel . “The whole thing that happened
with Netanyahu and Obama on Friday looked bad on television and
there’s a fear of what international investors will do
tomorrow.”  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit government bond due January
2020 gained, pushing the yield on the 5 percent bond down one
basis point to 5.15 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
