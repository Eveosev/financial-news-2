Aamal Co. (AHCS) , a Qatari holding company,
had its biggest two-day increase on record after it said May 18
it would list shares in the form of global depositary receipts
on the London Stock Exchange next month.  Aamal has soared 21 percent in the past two trading days,
the biggest rise since at least December 2007, when Bloomberg
started tracking the shares. They jumped 10 percent to 22.14
($6.08) riyals today.  The company will offer 118.8 million shares held by Faisal
Bin Qassim Al Thani, representing 24 percent of the company’s
share capital, Aamal said May 18. The company owns stakes in
industrial manufacturing, trading, real-estate and managed-
services businesses.  Aamal recently authorized an increase in its foreign
ownership limit to 49 percent from 25 percent and currently
lists 0.3 percent of its shares on Doha’s Qatar Exchange, Chief
Operating Officer Mohamed Dobashi said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
