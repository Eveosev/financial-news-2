German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere said military deployment that goes beyond defending
immediate national interests is justifiable,  Welt am Sonntag
said , citing an interview.  The minister is “puzzled” by calls from the German armed
forces association to discuss the constitutionality of such
deployment, the newspaper said.  De Maiziere also said he plans to work with the federal
employment agency on finding alternative jobs for those who lose
their jobs in a planned military revamp, which will see the
number of soldiers shrink by 18,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
