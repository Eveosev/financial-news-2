William Morrison Supermarkets Plc
plans to name advisers to help it prepare a 1.5 billion-pound
($2.4 billion) bid for Iceland Foods Ltd., the Telegraph said,
without saying where it got the information.  Iceland’s 750 stores would triple Morrison’s portfolio,
raising its market share to 14 percent, according to the
Telegraph. Private equity firms Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC,
Apax Partners LLP,  Lion Capital LLP  and BC Partners Ltd. may
have requested Iceland Foods sales material, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
