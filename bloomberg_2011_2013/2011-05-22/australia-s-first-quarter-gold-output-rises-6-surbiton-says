Australia ’s gold production rose 6
percent in the first quarter as mining operations withstood
cyclones that lashed the nation’s east and west coasts, a
research group said.  Output in the world’s second-biggest gold-producing nation
rose 4 metric tons from a year earlier to 65 tons in the three
months to March 31, Sandra Close, director at Melbourne-based
 Surbiton Associates Pty , said in an e-mailed statement.  Two cyclones hit Western Australia state in January and
February, while the eastern states battled rains and wind from
cyclones Anthony and Yasi, blocking access roads to many mines.  “The abnormally wet weather impacted both open-cut and
underground operations,” Close said. Mines had “performed well
under the circumstances,” she said.  Gold reached a record on May 2 as investors sought to
protect their wealth against accelerating inflation and concern
about the debt positions of European nations. Citigroup Inc.
raised its 2011 gold price forecast to $1,443 an ounce from
$1,416 an ounce, analyst Jon Bergtheil said in a report dated
May 20.  The Superpit, a venture between  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  and
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  located 550 kilometers (342 miles) east of
Perth, was Australia’s largest producer during the quarter with
200,000 ounces, Surbiton said.
