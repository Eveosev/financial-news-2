Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will spend
$12.6 billion on the world’s biggest sea vessel, the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  The floating liquefied natural gas production platform,
named the Prelude, will be built in South Korea and will take
gas from a reservoir off Australia’s coast and liquefy it for
transport by tankers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
