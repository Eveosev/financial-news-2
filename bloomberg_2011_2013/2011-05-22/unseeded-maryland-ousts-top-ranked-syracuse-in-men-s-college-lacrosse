The unseeded  University of Maryland 
beat top-ranked  Syracuse University  6-5 in overtime in the
national men’s college lacrosse tournament.  The Terrapins ended Syracuse’s run of 25 straight
quarterfinal victories in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament going back to 1983.  Maryland  will meet
the winner of today’s other quarterfinal between No. 4  Notre
Dame  and No. 5  Duke  for a place in the championship game.  Syracuse led 2-0 before conceding four unanswered goals at
Gillette Stadium in Foxborough,  Massachusetts . With the
Terrapins leading 5-4, Jovan Miller scored for the Orange with
65 seconds remaining to force overtime. Grant Catalino then won
it for the Terps with 32 seconds remaining in the extra period.  Maryland has lost five times in the championship game since
it claimed the last of its three national titles in 1975.
Today’s victory avenged an 11-6 defeat to Syracuse at the same
stage of the 2009 tournament, which the Orange went on to win
for a record 11th time.  The semifinals are scheduled for May 28 in Baltimore, with
the championship game two days later at the same M&T Bank
Stadium.  No. 7 seed  Virginia  will meet sixth-seeded Denver in the
other semifinal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
