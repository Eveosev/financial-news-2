Iraq signed an initial agreement to
import 25 million cubic meters of natural gas a day from  Iran 
for power stations, Mosaab Serri, a spokesman for the Iraqi
Ministry of Electricity, said.  The agreement provides for the installation of pipelines
within 18 months to transport gas from Iran to the Sadr and al-
Quds power stations in  Baghdad , he said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The agreement with Iran, which holds the worldâ€™s second-
largest gas reserves, requires the approval of the Iraqi Council
of Ministers and Parliament, the statement said.  The pipelines will pass the Mansouriya gas field, which is
due to supply gas to the two  power plants  instead of Iran
starting 2016, the statement said. Kuwait Energy Co., Turkiye
Petrolleri AO and Korea Gas, known as Kogas, secured rights to
develop Mansouriya. The license, granted last year along with
two other natural-gas contracts, has yet to be officially
ratified by the Iraqi Council of Ministers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
