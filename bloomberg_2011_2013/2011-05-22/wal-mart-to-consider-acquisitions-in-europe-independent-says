Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  plans to appoint
a London-based team of advisers to study potential mergers and
acquisitions in Europe, the Independent reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer, which owns Asda
in the U.K., seeks to expand in continental Europe as growth
slows in the U.S. and Britain, the newspaper said. The story is
“speculation dressed up as fact,” said  Kevin Gardner , a
spokesman for Wal-Mart.  The company is searching for office space near London’s
Heathrow airport in west London to accomodate 35 to 55 people,
who will lead the expansion, according to the Independent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
