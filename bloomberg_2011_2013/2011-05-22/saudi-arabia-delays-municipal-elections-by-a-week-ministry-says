Saudi Arabia , the Arab world’s
largest economy, postponed municipal elections by one week so
voting wouldn’t be the day before the National Day holiday.  The elections were delayed to Sept. 29 from Sept. 22, the
Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs said today in a
 statement  on its website.  Saudi Arabia held its first municipal elections in February
2005. The September voting is open only to males 21 years and
older who aren’t serving in the armed forces, according to the
kingdom’s election commission. The kingdom’s National Day is on
Sept. 23.  -- Editors: Rob Verdonck, Louis Meixler  To contact the reporter on this story:
