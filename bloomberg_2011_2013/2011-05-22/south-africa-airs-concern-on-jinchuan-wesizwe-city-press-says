South Africa ’s resources department
met with Jinchuan Group Ltd. and  Wesizwe (WEZ)  Platinum Ltd. this week
after the Chinese company replaced the local company’s chief
executive officer,  City Press  said, citing Zingaphi Jakuja, a
department spokeswoman.  The Department of Mineral Resources sent a letter
highlighting concerns to the companies, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said, without specifying the concerns. The replacement
of executives could have a negative effect on the government’s
attempts to increase local black people’s involvement in
management, City Press said, citing the South African Mining
Development Association’s acting chairman, Willy Leeuw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
