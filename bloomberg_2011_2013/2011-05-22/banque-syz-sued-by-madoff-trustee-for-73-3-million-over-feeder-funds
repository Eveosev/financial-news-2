Banque Syz & Co. was sued for $73.3
million by the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff’s firm.  The Swiss bank, which received the money from so-called
feeder funds, “knew or should have known of numerous
irregularities” about the con man’s firm because of its
expertise in private banking and institutional asset management,
trustee  Irving Picard  said in a May 20 bankruptcy court filling.  Calls to the Geneva bank’s main number went unanswered
outside of regular business hours.  Banque Syz, which had an account in New York with Madoff’s
firm, filed a customer claim seeking to recover funds it said it
lost on Madoff investments, according to Picard’s filing. In the
process, the bank “submitted” to the jurisdiction of the
bankruptcy court and “should reasonably expect to be subject to
New York jurisdiction,” the trustee said.  The case is Irving H. Picard v. Banque Syz & Co., 11-02149,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
