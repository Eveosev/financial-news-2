Singapore  will create more jobs in
financial services during the next 12 months than any other
city, beating London and  New York , said recruiter  Astbury
Marsden , which advises companies in Europe and Asia.  A survey of investment bankers showed 37 percent expect
Singapore to add the most jobs, the London-based recruitment
firm said in an e-mailed statement. The survey showed 22 percent
expect London to create the most jobs, just ahead of Shanghai
and  Hong Kong , while 1 percent said New York.  “Singapore has rapidly established itself as the
destination of choice for City firms looking to expand their
business in Asia,” said Mark Cameron, Chief Operating Officer
of Astbury Marsden.  Singapore’s hedge-fund industry  grew  to S$59 billion ($48
billion) at the end of 2009, from about $10 billion in 2005,
according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which is both
the central bank and regulator of Singapore’s financial system.  Algebris Investments LLP, a London-based hedge fund, was
among those to open an office in Singapore last year.  “Cities close to emerging markets are at the forefront of
the global expansion in financial services,” Cameron said.  The survey showed 19 percent of respondents expected the
most jobs to be created in Shanghai, 17 percent said Hong Kong
and 4 percent nominated the United Arab Emirates, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
