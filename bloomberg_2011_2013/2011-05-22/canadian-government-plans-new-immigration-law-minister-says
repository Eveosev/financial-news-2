Canada’s ruling  Conservative Party 
will reintroduce a law aimed at curbing human smuggling when
Parliament convenes next month, Immigration Minister  Jason Kenney  said.  The proposed law was scrapped earlier this year when an
election was called for May 2. The Conservatives won the right
to form a majority government in the vote, which means they no
longer need the support of opposition lawmakers to pass laws.  A cargo ship carrying about 500 Sri Lankan refugees made
headlines in August when it reached Canadian waters off the
coast of British Columbia. Canada said at the time that human
smugglers were behind the operation.  “Criminal networks” are charging people “tens of
thousands of dollars” to transport them to  Canada  illegally,
Kenney told CTV television network’s Question Period program in
an interview in Ottawa today.  “We committed in our platform to bring forward a bill to
crack down on human smuggling,” the minister said. “We know
those operations are still going on in East Asia. So this
legislation will come forward fairly early to try to deter
them.”  The proposed law would also make it easier for Canada to
deport fraudulent refugee claimants after a few months instead
of several years, Kenney said. About 60 percent of the asylum
seekers who come to Canada are found “not to be legitimately in
need of our protection,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
