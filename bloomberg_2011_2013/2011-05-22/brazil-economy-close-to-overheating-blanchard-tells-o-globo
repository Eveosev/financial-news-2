The Brazilian economy is close
to “overheating” and an increase in  interest rates  and
“budget consolidation” are desirable, the International
Monetary Fund’s  Olivier Blanchard  told  O Globo  newspaper.  Brazil needs to be prepared for negative shocks, such as a
drop in raw material prices, Blanchard told the Rio de Janeiro-
based newspaper in an interview. The economist also said it’s
reasonable to adopt certain measures to limit the appreciation
of the real, such as reserve accumulation and capital controls,
according to O Globo.  For now, Brazil has adopted the right measures to address
risks, Blanchard told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
