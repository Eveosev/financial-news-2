A Bahraini security court upheld the
death penalty for two defendants after they appealed a
conviction for their role in killing two police officers, the
official Bahrain News Agency reported.  Two other defendants had their death sentences changed to
life, the Manama-based news service said, citing the military
prosecutor.  Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, declared
martial law in March as it sought to quell Shiite Muslim-led
demonstrations calling for more democracy and civil rights after
popular uprisings ousted rulers in Egypt and  Tunisia  earlier
this year. Bahrain’s Sunni Muslim king, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, issued a decree on May 8 ordering an end to the
nationwide state of emergency on June 1.  Shiites make up about 70 percent of the Bahraini population
of less than 1 million and many retain cultural and family ties
with Iran as well as with Shiites in neighboring  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
