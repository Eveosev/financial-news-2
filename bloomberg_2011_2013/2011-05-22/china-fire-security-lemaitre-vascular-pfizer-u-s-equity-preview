Shares of the following companies are
having unusual moves in U.S. trading today. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 2:30 p.m. in  New York .  Industrial and commodity shares fell as a report indicated
manufacturing may slow in  China  and concerns increased that
 Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  ,
the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, fell the
second-most in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , sinking 2
percent to $102.32.  Joy Global Inc. (JOYG)  , maker of P&H and
Joy mining equipment, slid 3 percent to $87.60.  Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)   lost 2.6 percent to $53.26.
 International Paper Co. (IP)   slipped 3.7 percent to $30.14
for the biggest retreat in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Bio-Reference Labs Inc. (BRLI)   slipped 4.2 percent to
$23.90 and declined 7 percent earlier, the most intraday since
Dec. 16. The company may be overvalued as it trades at a 25
percent valuation premium over competitors while its margins are
about half, Barron’s reported, without citing anyone.  Boeing Co. (BA)   dropped 1.3 percent to $76.52 and fell
to $75.77 earlier, the lowest intraday price since April 27. The
company’s plan to ship the first of its newest jumbo jets by
mid-2011 as part of the “Year of the 747” risks another delay
that would add to the 18-month setback for the plane, Cowen &
Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF)   rose the most in the
 S&P 500 , climbing 6.1 percent to $147.50. The world’s second-
largest maker of nitrogen fertilizer was boosted to
“overweight” from “neutral” by JPMorgan Chase & Co., which
cited “its valuation, solid cash flow characteristics, strong
crop prices and a favorable outlook for agricultural
fundamentals in the years ahead.”  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)   had the second-biggest
increase in the Russell 2000 Index, surging 17 percent to
$11.77. The Blackstone Group LP-backed owner of a U.S. liquefied
natural-gas terminal rallied for a second day after winning
government approval to export the fuel to more countries.  China Fire & Security Group Inc. (CFSG)   jumped 16
percent to $8.48 and rallied 17 percent earlier, the most
intraday since February 2010. The Beijing-based maker of safety
products is being acquired by Bain Capital Partners LLC for $9 a
share.  DemandTec Inc. (DMAN)   fell 4.4 percent to $9.58 after
slumping to $8.94 earlier, the lowest intraday price since Sept.
23. The  San Mateo , California-based provider of consumer demand
management software was cut to “market perform” from “market
outperform” at JMP Securities LLC.  Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. (KKD)   climbed the most in
the Russell 2000 Index, rising 24 percent to $7.93. The doughnut
chain reported first-quarter earnings of 13 cents a share,
beating the 9-cent average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD US) declined 2.1 percent to $91.16
after dropping as much as 9.8 percent. LinkedIn, the first major
U.S. social-media company to go public, more than doubled
following its initial public offering last week. The drop is “a
natural reaction to the surge in the stock price that occurred
last week, especially given the market weakness” today,
according to Clay Moran, an analyst at Benchmark Co.  Pinnacle Entertainment Inc. (PNK)   rose 2.6 percent to
$14.02 after gaining as much as 6.6 percent, the most intraday
since Jan. 13. The U.S. casino owner was raised to
“outperform” from “neutral” by Credit Suisse Group AG
analyst Joel Simkins, who said he was more confident in the
company’s prospects after visits to its properties.  Tech Data Corp. (TECD)   fell the most in the Russell 1000
Index, dropping 12 percent to $47.17. The distributor of
computer products posted first-quarter profit and sales that
missed analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
