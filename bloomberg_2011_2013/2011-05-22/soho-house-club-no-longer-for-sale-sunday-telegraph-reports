Soho House U.K. Ltd. has been
withdrawn from the market, the Sunday Telegraph reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Owners Richard Carling and Nick Jones agreed to forgo
selling the private membersâ€™ club business for at least another
year, the newspaper said. Soho House received a number of offers
from private equity firms, valuing the company at as much as 300
million pounds ($487 million), according to the Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
