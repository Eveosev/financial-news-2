Japanese and Australian stock futures
fell as Fitch Ratings cut Greece’s credit rating three levels
and the euro weakened, reducing the outlook for export earnings.  American depositary receipts of Canon Inc., the world’s
largest manufacturer of cameras which counts  Europe  as its
biggest market, lost 0.7 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo on March 20. Those of Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker which
gets about 15 percent of its sales in Europe, declined 0.9
percent. American depositary receipts of BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s No. 1 miner, dropped 0.5 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,530 in Chicago on May 20, compared with 9,620
in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,540 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index lost 0.8 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
slid 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “Greece’s debt restructuring is ready to start at any
time,”  Takero Inaizumi , head of equity research in Tokyo at
Mizuho Investors Securities Co. “There’s concern that will
affect exports negatively.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.2
percent today. In  New York , the index lost 0.8 percent to
1,333.27 on May 20 after Gap Inc. cut its earnings forecast and
concern grew that  Greece  will default.  Fitch Ratings cut Greece three levels to B+, four steps
below investment grade, from BB+. Fitch said even a “soft”
restructuring of debt being studied by European Union policy
makers would be considered a default. Fitch said Greece could
face a further reduction in its creditworthiness.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.2 percent this year
through May 20, compared with gains of 6 percent by the S&P 500
and 1.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  The yen appreciated to 115.27 against the euro, compared
with 117.13 at the close of  stock trading  in  Tokyo  on May 20. A
stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies when overseas
revenue is converted into their home currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
