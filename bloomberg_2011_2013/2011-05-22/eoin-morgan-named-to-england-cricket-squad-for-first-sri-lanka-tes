Eoin Morgan was named to the  England 
cricket squad for the first Test match against Sri Lanka this
month, with  Ravi Bopara  missing out.  Morgan, 24, made his Test debut for England last summer,
playing in six matches with a top score of 130 against Pakistan
in Nottingham. He was part of the squad which retained the Ashes
in Australia over the winter, but did not play in any of the
five Tests.  “Eoin Morgan impressed us last summer when he was given
his opportunity in the Test side and has worked hard on his game
throughout the tour of Australia and now has the opportunity to
play a role in the Test team,” Geoff Miller, England national
selector, said in a statement.  The 26-year-old Bopara had been considered the favourite in
U.K. media to be selected following  Paul Collingwood ’s decision
to retire from Test cricket.  The three-match series against Sri Lanka begins May 26 in
Cardiff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
