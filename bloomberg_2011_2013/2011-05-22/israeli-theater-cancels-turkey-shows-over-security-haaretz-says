Israel ’s Cameri Theater canceled
planned performances in  Turkey  yesterday after learning that
anti-Israel activists planned to disrupt the shows, Haaretz
said, citing Cameri Director-General Noam Semel.  “People say the show must go on, but unfortunately there
are circumstances under which the show must end," Semel told
Haaretz. "It happens when a theater production can cause
bloodshed."   The Tel Aviv-based Cameri was scheduled to give
performances at a theater festival in Antalya until it was told
by the Israeli embassy in Turkey there could be security
concerns, Haaretz said. Political tensions between the two
countries increased after the death of nine Turkish activists
during an Israeli naval raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla last a
year ago.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
