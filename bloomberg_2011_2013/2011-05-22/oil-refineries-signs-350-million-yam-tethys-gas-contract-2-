Oil Refineries Ltd. (ORL)  signed a $350
million natural-gas contract with the Yam Tethys project in
 Israel  after two disruptions in supplies from East Mediterranean
Gas Co. caused by attacks on the network.  “The contract with Yam Tethys, in addition to the existing
contract with the Egyptian gas supplier, completes Oil
Refineries’ transfer to natural gas as the company’s main source
of energy,” Chief Executive Officer Pinchas Buchris said in an
e-mailed statement.  Oil Refineries, based in Haifa, Israel, is trying to cut
fuel oil consumption in favor of natural gas to help reduce
 carbon emissions  blamed for global warming. In December, it
signed a 20-year contract with EMG.  The shares fell 1.6 percent to 2.474 shekels at the 4:30
p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .  To contact the reporter on this story:
