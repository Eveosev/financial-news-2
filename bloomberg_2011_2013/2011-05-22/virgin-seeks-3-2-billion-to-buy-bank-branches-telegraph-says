Virgin Money Holdings UK Ltd. is in
talks with investors to raise 2 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) to
bid for the branches of  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and Northern
Rock Plc, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing unidentified
people familiar with the matter.  Lloyds Chairman Win Bischoff has said the bank will find a
buyer for 600 branches before the end of the year. Northern Rock
may decide the sale of 70 branches this week, according to the
Telegraph. Virgin Money is likely to make offers for both, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
