David Toms ended a five-year title
drought with a one-shot win at the U.S.  PGA Tour ’s Crowne Plaza
Invitational, a victory that came a week after he lost golf’s
Players Championship in a playoff.  Toms shot a 3-under-par 67 during yesterday’s final round
at the Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth,  Texas , to finish at
15-under par, one better than Charlie Wi.  Toms, 44, collects $1.12 million for his first victory
since the 2006 Sony Open in  Hawaii . It’s his 13th PGA Tour win.  “To win after this time frame and to come back after what
happened last week, it certainly means more to me than any other
victory,” said Toms, who missed a 3 1/2-foot par putt last week
to lose the Players Championship to K.J. Choi.  Toms began the tournament at Colonial with consecutive
rounds of 62 before shooting a third-round 74 to get overtaken
by Wi, a 39-year-old South Korean who was seeking his
breakthrough win on the world’s richest golf circuit.  Toms recovered yesterday, when he had two birdies, one
bogey and holed out for eagle on the par-5 11th hole to take the
outright lead. His lob wedge from 85 yards out landed about four
inches in front of the flag, hopped past it and then spun back
into the hole.  “When stuff like that happens, it’s like it’s meant to
be,” said Toms, the 2001 PGA Championship winner.  The tour remains in the Dallas- Fort Worth  area for the
Byron Nelson Championship at TPC Four Seasons Resort in Irving,
Texas, from May 26-29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
