U.S. and Dubai-based companies held
talks with Turkish authorities in Ankara on a planned auction to
sell 80 percent of Baskent Dogalgaz Dagitim AS, the city’s
natural-gas distribution company, Zaman reported.  The newspaper didn’t name the companies.  Turkey ’s asset-
sales agency canceled on May 10 the sale of the stake after the
winning bidder in last year’s auction failed to pay the $1.21
billion it had promised. The agency plans a new sale by October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
