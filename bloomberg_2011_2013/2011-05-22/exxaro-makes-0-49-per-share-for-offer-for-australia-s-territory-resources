Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) , a South
African coal miner, agreed to pay A$123 million ($129 million)
for  Territory Resources Ltd. (TTY)  as it seeks acquisitions to meet a
goal of producing 10 million metric tons of  iron ore  a year.  Exxaro offered A$0.46 a share for the iron-ore miner based
in Perth, Western Australia, the companies said in a statement
today. The bid, at a 64 percent premium to the closing price on
May 20, was recommended by Territory’s board, they said.  Exxaro, based in Johannesburg, is expanding into iron ore
to meet surging demand for the steelmaking ingredient from  China 
and  India . Rising imports by Chinese steel producers have fueled
an almost threefold increase in iron ore prices since 2008.  “We’ve scanned and scouted a host of iron ore-related
opportunities and do have other potential targets on our radar
screens,” Chief Financial Officer Wim De Klerk said. Exxaro
aims to produce an annual 10 million tons within a decade.  The South African company fell 5.2 percent to 154.50 rand
by the 5 p.m. close of trading in Johannesburg. Territory rose
59 percent to A$0.445 by the 4:10 p.m. close in Sydney.  While DCM Decometal GMBH, with 11.2 percent of Territory,
agreed to sell,  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) , the Australian miner’s largest
shareholder, hasn’t said what it will do, De Klerk said. Noble
owns about 22 percent of Territory, according to Bloomberg data.  Territory  has a mine at Frances Creek, in Australia’s
Northern Territory, producing about 1.6 million tons of iron ore
a year, Exxaro said. The Australian company also has rights to
areas near the mine, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
