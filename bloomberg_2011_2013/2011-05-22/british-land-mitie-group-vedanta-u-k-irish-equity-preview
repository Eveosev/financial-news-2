U.K. and Irish stocks sank, dragging
the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  to its lowest level in two months,
as raw-material shares fell amid lower metal prices and  Ryanair
Holdings Plc (RYA)  said it will cut capacity due to higher costs.  Mining companies  Rio Tinto  Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  fell
more than 2 percent.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  slid the most in a
month as crude declined. Ryanair,  Europe ’s largest discount
carrier, tumbled 5.3 percent. International Consolidated
Airlines Group slid the most in 11 months as ash from a volcanic
eruption in Iceland threatened trans-Atlantic flights.  The FTSE 100 dropped 112.60, or 1.9 percent, to 5,835.89 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the lowest since March 23. The
gauge has slipped 0.7 percent in 2011 amid concern that  Greece 
will be unable to repay its debts. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index lost 1.9 percent today, and Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated
1.7 percent.  “It seems wise for us to take some risk off the table and
allow our cash positions to build up,” said Lothar Mentel, who
oversees about $3.2 billion as the London-based chief investment
officer at Octopus Investments Ltd. “Equities remain our
preferred asset, and there’s still the possibility that equities
could gather upward momentum in the last two quarters of the
year, but given the absence of any meaningful forecasting for
2012, this may become a good pricing point at which to take
profits.”  Debt Crisis  Elsewhere in Europe,  Spain ’s Socialists suffered a defeat
in local elections as voters punished Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero’s party for soaring unemployment and spending
cuts. Standard & Poor’s cut  Italy ’s credit-rating outlook to
negative from stable, citing slowing economic growth and
“diminished” prospects for a reduction of government debt.  Rio Tinto sank 2 percent to 4,033 pence.  BHP Billiton 
declined 2.4 percent to 2,304 pence. Copper, nickel and tin
prices dropped in London.  Shell, Europe’s biggest oil company, declined 2.3 percent
to 2,095 pence.  BP Plc (BP/)  fell 1.7 percent to 452 pence. Crude
retreated 2.5 percent to $96.98 a barrel in  New York  amid
concern Europe’s sovereign debt crisis will spread, slowing
economic growth and reducing fuel demand.  Ryanair retreated 5.3 percent to 3.36 euros in Dublin after
saying it would cut capacity for the first time in its history
next winter as higher fuel costs threaten to render swathes of
the network unprofitable.  IAG, the parent of British Airways, fell 5.1 percent to 235
pence, the biggest drop since June. A volcanic eruption that
began May 21 under Europe’s largest glacier, Vatnajokull, could
threaten trans-Atlantic air traffic with ash reaching the U.K.
as early as tonight, according to Britain’s weather agency.  Mitie Group Plc (MTO) , a U.K. based services and maintenance
company, rallied 5 percent to 220.4 pence as full-year revenue
topped analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
