Luke Donald  will face fellow
Englishman Ian Poulter in today’s final of the Volvo World Match
Play Championship in Spain.  Donald, No. 2 in the Official World Golf Ranking, defeated
No. 3 Martin Kaymer of Germany 5 & 3 in this morning’s semifinal
at the Finca Cortesin Golf Club in Costa del Sol. Donald can
pass  Lee Westwood  atop the world rankings by winning the final.  Poulter came from behind to beat Nicolas Colsaerts of
Belgium in 19 holes. Poulter trailed by three holes after seven,
tied the match on the 16th and won on the first extra hole with
a par as Colsaerts made bogey.  Poulter, ranked 22nd in the world, eliminated Westwood in
the round of 16 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
