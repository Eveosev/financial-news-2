Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, would like to
see  Greece  found an independent privatization agency to help
sell off some of the government’s assets,  Spiegel said , citing
an interview with Juncker.  The agency, which could be similar to  Germany ’s model,
should include foreign “experts,” Juncker said, according to
the German magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
