Australia ’s dollar fell to the lowest
level in almost five weeks against its U.S. counterpart as
manufacturing slowed in China, the nation’s biggest trade
partner, and concern grew that  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  The Aussie dropped against all of its 16 most-traded peers
tracked by Bloomberg. New Zealand’s dollar sank from almost the
highest in more than two weeks against the greenback amid signs
the global economic recovery is losing momentum.  “There’s a risk-averse mood in the market, spurred by
uncertainty about the European debt crisis,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, a senior currency analyst in  Tokyo  at Ueda Harlow
Ltd., which provides foreign-exchange margin-trading services.
“Concerns over a slowdown in the global economic recovery are
also leading to selling of the Aussie and kiwi.”  Australia’s currency dropped 1.4 percent to $1.0509 at
12:41 p.m. in  New York , from $1.0660 on May 20. It touched
$1.0479, the lowest level since April 19. The Aussie weakened
1.3 percent to 85.99 yen, from 87.10 yen.  The  New Zealand dollar  declined 0.9 percent to 78.86 U.S.
cents, after rising on May 20 to 79.99 cents, the strongest
level since May 3. The currency fell 0.8 percent to 64.53 yen.  Stocks tumbled as Wolfgang Franz, head of German Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s council of economic advisers, said the euro
region’s permanent rescue fund needs to be renegotiated. The
MSCI World Index touched the lowest since April 18 and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.3 percent. The VIX, an
index of market volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge,
climbed as much as 15 percent to 20, a two-month high.  A  China  manufacturing index was 51.1 for May compared with
51.8 in April, according to a preliminary reading today of the
Purchasing Managers’ Index by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. A number above 50 indicates expansion.  “Chinese manufacturing sentiment deteriorated,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist at Credit Agricole SA in  Hong Kong ,
wrote in a note to clients today. “Emerging Asian currencies
succumbed to a significant sell-off today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
