Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (OTLD)  climbed
to the highest level in almost seven months after Deutsche Bank
AG raised the biggest mobile-phone operator in North Africa to
“buy” from “hold.”  The shares climbed 4.1 percent to 4.54 Egyptian pounds (76
cents) at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the highest since Oct.
26. The country’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  gained 3 percent.  The company’s London-listed global depositary receipts were
assigned a 12-month price estimate of $4.20. The GDRs fell 1.1
percent to $3.66 in  London  on May 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
