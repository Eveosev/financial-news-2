U.K. pay growth at manufacturers
accelerated in the three months through April, the Engineering
Employers Federation said.  The average pay settlement among manufacturers increased to
2.5 percent from a 2.4 percent gain in the quarter through
March, London-based EEF said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Despite the small increase we are only returning to the
level of settlements we would expect to see by historical
standards,” Lee Hopley, chief economist at the lobby group,
said in the statement. “Economic uncertainty and the need for
companies to control their costs in the face of global pressures
continue to be the main driver of agreements.”  The EEF data cover 180 pay settlements affecting 35,412
employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
