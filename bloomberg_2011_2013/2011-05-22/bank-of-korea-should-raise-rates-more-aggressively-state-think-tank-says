The  Bank of Korea  should raise
interest rates more aggressively to tackle fast-growing
inflationary pressures, government-run think tank Korea
Development Institute said.  “Demand-driven inflation is fast accelerating here,” the
KDI said in a report released today. “As long as the  base rate 
is kept as low as it is now, it will be hard to anchor in
inflation expectations.”  Higher interest rates and sustained economic growth will
likely push the won higher, which should be tolerated because it
will help ease price gains, the research institute said.  The KDI also called for policy measures to cope with
growing risks related to record-high  household debt , including
by closely monitoring reckless loans in the non-banking sectors.  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy will likely grow 4.2 percent
this year and 4.3 percent next year on exports and domestic
demand, the KDI projected. Inflation is expected to accelerate
to 4.1 percent in 2011, exceeding the central bank’s target
limit.  The  Bank of Korea  held off from boosting borrowing costs
for two months after two quarter-point increases in January and
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
