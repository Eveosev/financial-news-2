Iceland ’s Keflavik International
Airport closed for take offs and landings from 8:30 a.m
amid increasing fears that an ash plume from a volcanic eruption
might damage  jet engines , said RUV citing the Civil Protection
Department.  The decision will stop 11 airplanes from taking off in
Iceland and affect about 2,000 passengers, said the Reykjavik-
based broadcaster. Another 13 airplanes were scheduled to land
in Keflavik later today, RUV said.  An eruption began at about 6 p.m. yesterday in a crater by
Grimsvotn Lake underneath Vatnajokull Glacier, about 90 miles
(145 kilometers) southeast of Iceland’s capital of Reykjavik.
The volcano is the most active in Iceland and its last eruption
ended in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
