The  Dallas Mavericks  took a 2-1 lead
in the National Basketball Association’s Western Conference
finals with a 93-87 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder.  Dirk Nowitzki  and Shawn Marion each scored 18 points for
the Mavericks last night at Oklahoma City Arena.  “He’s the best,” Dallas guard Jason Kidd said of Nowitzki.
“Even if he’s not making shots early, he wants the ball to make
a play.”  Russell Westbrook had 30 points and  Kevin Durant  got 24
points and 12 rebounds for the Thunder.  The Thunder are looking to reach the NBA finals for the
first time since they relocated from Seattle in 2008. The
franchise won its sole NBA title in 1979, as the SuperSonics,
and last made the finals in 1996. Dallas lost to the  Miami Heat 
on its only trip to the championship series, in 2006.  The series continues tomorrow in Oklahoma City. The winner
of the best-of-seven series will face the Heat or Chicago Bulls
in the finals. That series resumes in Miami today with the teams
tied at one win each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
