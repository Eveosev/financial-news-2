Cyprusâ€™s main opposition party, the
right wing DISY, and AKEL, the ruling Communist Party, both made
gains in parliamentary elections today that drew a historically
low turnout, the Ministry of the Interior said.  DISY garnered 34.3 percent of the total 404,518 votes
compared with 30.5 percent in the 2006 elections, the Election
Service of the Interior Ministry said in a  statement  on its
website. AKEL won 32.7 percent of the vote compared with 31.3
percent five years ago, while its coalition partner, center-
right DIKO, saw its share of the vote decline to 15.8 percent
from 18 percent.  AKEL and DIKO lost their absolute majority in the 56-seat
parliament as they secured 19 and 9 seats, respectively, while
DISY increased its seats by 2, to 20, state television CyBC
reported, citing the Elections Service. Socialist Party EDEK
maintained its 5 seats, while the nationalist European Party
elected 2 deputies and the Green Party 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
