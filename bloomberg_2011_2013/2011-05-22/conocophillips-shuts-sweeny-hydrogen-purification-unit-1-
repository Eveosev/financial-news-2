ConocoPhillips (COP) , the third-largest
U.S. oil company, temporarily shut a hydrogen plant Friday to
fix a leak at its Sweeny refinery in Old Ocean, Texas, according
to a state environmental  filing .  The leak was discovered May 20, and the unit began shutting
down that afternoon, the company said in a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. The leak was located on a
drain valve, according to the filing.  Excess gas flared at about 9 p.m. local time May 20,
according to the filing.  The leak was repaired and the unit was in restart,
according to the filing.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  are the largest U.S.
oil companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
