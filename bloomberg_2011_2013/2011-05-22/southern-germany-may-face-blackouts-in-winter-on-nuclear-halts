Southern  Germany  may face blackouts
this winter if the government halts the seven oldest nuclear
 power plants  permanently, the country’s high-voltage power grid
operators said.  Security of supply would be “seriously endangered” and
the country would rely on imports on “very cold” days with low
wind-power output, the grid operators said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The grid companies are  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) ,
 RWE AG (RWE) , TenneT Holding BV and Elia System Operator SA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
