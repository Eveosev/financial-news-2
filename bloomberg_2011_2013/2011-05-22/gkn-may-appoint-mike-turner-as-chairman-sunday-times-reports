GKN Plc (GKN)  may name former BAE Systems
Plc Chief Executive Officer  Mike Turner  as its chairman, the
Sunday Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Turner, who already chairs Babcock International Group Plc,
is being lined up to take the role when  Roy Brown  steps down at
GKNâ€™s annual general meeting in May 2012, the newspaper
reported. He has not yet been formally given the role, the
Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
