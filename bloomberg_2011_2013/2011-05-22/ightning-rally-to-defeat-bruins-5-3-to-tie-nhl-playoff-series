The Tampa Bay Lightning rallied from
a three-goal first-period deficit to beat the  Boston  Bruins 5-3
and tie their National Hockey League playoff series at two
games apiece.  Teddy Purcell got two goals and Sean Bergenheim added
another in the second period for the Lightning. Two goals from
Patrice Bergeron and a third by Michael Ryder gave Boston the
early advantage at St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa,  Florida ,
yesterday.  Simon Gagne gave the Lightning the lead in the third
period and Martin St. Louis capped the comeback with an empty-
net goal in the final minute.  Game 5 is scheduled for tomorrow at TD Garden in Boston.
The teams will return to Tampa for Game 6 two days later, with
the Bruins hosting a decider, if necessary, on May 27.  The winner will advance to the Stanley Cup finals against
the  Vancouver Canucks  or San Jose Sharks. That series resumes
today in Vancouver, with the home team leading the best-of-
seven series by two games to one.  To contact the reporter on this story:
