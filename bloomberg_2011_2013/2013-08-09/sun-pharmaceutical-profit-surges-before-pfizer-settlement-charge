Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) ,
 India ’s biggest drugmaker by market value, posted a 56 percent
increase in profit before a one-time charge as sales of its
generic drugs in the U.S. climbed.  Profit before a one-time payment to settle a patent
litigation with Pfizer Inc. was 12.41 billion rupees (204.8
million) in the quarter ended June, compared with 7.96 billion
rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based Sun said in a statement
today. The group reported a loss of 12.8 billion rupees during
the period, compared with a median estimate for a profit of 10.3
billion rupees in a Bloomberg survey.  “If you exclude the one-time payment, which was known to
the market, the sales, margins and profits have all beaten our
estimates,” said Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking
Pvt. “We expect the stocks to rally about 5 percent” on Aug.
12. Centrum will maintain its buy rating on the stock and revise
the target price of 628 rupees, Kapadia said.  Sun, controlled by billionaire Dilip Shanghvi, paid 25.2
billion rupees to  Pfizer (PFE)  to settle the litigation over sales of
heartburn drug Protonix, the company said. Sun agreed in June to
pay $550 million as settlement, compared with the $100 million
it had set aside for the damages. Sun and Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. will together pay $2.15 billion to Pfizer and a
partner to settle the litigation, Pfizer said in June.  Sales increased 31 percent to 34.8 billion rupees in the
three months ended June from a year earlier, Sun said. Sales of
finished dosages in the U.S. grew 28 percent to $364 million in
the first quarter from a year earlier, it said. Overseas sales
accounted for 57 percent of Sun’s total revenue in the year
ended in March 2011.  Sun’s  shares  have advanced 50 percent to 505.70 rupees in
the past year, the most among the 30 companies on the benchmark
S&P BSE Sensex. The 17-member S&P BSE India Healthcare Index has
rallied 21 percent in the past year compared with an advance of
7 percent on the Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
