Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
Britain’s biggest taxpayer-owned lender, agreed to sell part of
its Indian operations to Ratnakar Bank Ltd. after talks with
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  collapsed last year.  The purchase of  RBS (RBS) ’s business banking, credit card and
mortgage units, is subject to approval by the  Competition
Commission  of India, the companies said in a joint statement
today. The takeover will affect about 120,000 of RBS’s clients
in the country. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  RBS said it would consider closing its Indian consumer and
commercial banking operations after talks to sell them to HSBC,
Europe’s largest bank by assets, collapsed last year. The
Edinburgh-based lender is under pressure from regulators to sell
assets to bolster capital after receiving the biggest bank
bailout in the world.  “This transaction enables us to fast track our growth,”
Rajeev Ahuja, head of strategy and markets at closely held
Ratnakar Bank, said in the statement.  RBS’s private bank as well as its corporate and
institutional banking unit in  India  are unaffected by the sale,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
