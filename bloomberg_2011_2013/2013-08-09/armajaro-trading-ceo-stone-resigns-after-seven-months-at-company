Armajaro Trading Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Stone resigned after seven months on the job.
He’s the second CEO in less than a year to leave the position at
the London-based supplier of soft commodities such as cocoa.  Richard Gower, co-founder of Armajaro Holdings Ltd. which
also owns a hedge fund, will be the new CEO, the company said in
an e-mail statement today.  Stone took over the top job on Jan. 14 from Gower, who at
the time was acting CEO, having replaced Richard Ryan who left
Armajaro in September.  Brian Buckley, a spokesman for Armajaro’s public relations
representative Brunswick Group LLP, declined by phone to comment
on the reasons for Stone’s resignation.  Armajaro Trading reported a loss of $10.3 million for the
year ended Sept. 30, according to a filing to U.K. Companies
House. That compared with a profit of $24.3 million in the 17
months ended Sept. 30, 2011. The company didn’t provide
comparative figures for the year earlier. The company sold $2.85
billion in commodities in the reporting period ending in
September 2012.  The International Finance Corp., the  World Bank ’s private
lending arm, took a 6 percent stake and invested $55 million in
Armajaro last year. Since then new appointments include a chief
financial officer, at least two board members, a head of cocoa
trading and a head of coffee trading.  Armajaro Trading in April said it ceased talks to take over
Plexus Cotton Ltd., based in Liverpool,  England . The companies
said they were going to continue to work together on joint
ventures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
