BMC Software Inc. (BMC)  set the final rate
on $3.88 billion of term loans backing its buyout led by Bain
Capital LLC, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  A $2.88 billion portion will pay interest at 4 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, with a 1
percent floor on the lending benchmark, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because they werenâ€™t authorized to
speak publicly. The provider of software for corporate  computer
networks  also priced a $335 million term loan at the same level.  The rate for a 500 million-euro ($667 million) piece was
set at a spread of 4.5 percentage points more than Euribor, with
a 1 percent minimum on the benchmark, said the person.  The Houston-based company is selling all three pieces to
investors at 99 percent of face value, reducing proceeds for the
borrower and boosting the yield for investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
