Mexico’s peso posted a weekly advance
as President Enrique Pena Nieto planned to present a proposal
ending the state’s monopoly on oil production.  The currency appreciated 0.4 percent this week to 12.6174
per  U.S. dollar , after dropping 0.1 percent today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The peso has advanced 1.9 percent
this year, the best performance among major currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  Pledges made by Mexican ruling party leaders that the
government will seek constitutional changes to break Petroleos
Mexicanos’s oil monopoly are “credit positive,”  Mauro Leos , a
New York-based senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors
Service, said in a telephone interview this week. Pena Nieto
said in an Aug. 7 statement that he would delay the announcement
of his proposal to end the seven-decade state energy monopoly
until next week.  “If there’s a modification to the constitution, that would
lead to some private investment,” Eduardo Rodriguez, a currency
trader at Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB, said in a telephone
interview from Guadalajara, Mexico. “Then it would make it
attractive for capital inflows.”  Industrial production unexpectedly declined 2.4 percent in
June from a year earlier, the national statistics agency
reported today. Output missed the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg for a fifth consecutive month.  Yields on government peso bonds due in 2024 fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.77 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yields have declined four basis
points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
