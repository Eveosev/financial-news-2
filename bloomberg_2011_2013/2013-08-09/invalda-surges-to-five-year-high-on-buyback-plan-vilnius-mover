Invalda LT AB, Lithuania’s only
publicly traded investment company, jumped to the highest level
in almost five years after announcing plans to buy back shares.  The stock rose as much as 5.4 percent to 2.95 euros, the
highest since Sept. 2008, and traded up 5 percent at 2.94 euros
at 2:35 p.m. in Vilnius. Volume of 12,560 shares was triple the
three-month daily average.  Shareholders will vote Aug. 30 on whether to allow the
company to buy as much as 10 percent of its own shares over the
next 12 months in the range of 2.5 euros to 3.5 euros each,
Invalda  said  on its website late yesterday. The company said it
has money set aside for such purchases.  “While this may only be a psychological attempt to keep
the share price in a certain band, it shows what value the board
attaches to the shares,” Finasta equity analyst Tadas Povilauskas said in a note to investors today. “Invalda LT’s
net asset value is close to 3 euros per share.”  The company owns 45 percent of Lithuanian furniture maker
Vilniaus Baldai AB, 20 percent of agribusiness group Litagra
UAB, a group of IT service companies, a property management firm
and commercial real estate, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
