(Corrects Scout attribution in second paragraph)  Plans by  Tim Hortons  Inc.,  Canada ’s
largest coffee and doughnut chain, to buy back C$900 million
($872 million) in shares and reduce capital deployed in the U.S.
are a “good first step” to boost value, Scout Capital
Management LLC said.  Tim Hortons Chief Executive Officer Marc Caira yesterday
announced plans to reduce investment in its U.S. operations
starting in 2014 and raise debt to buy back stock.  “We were pleased to hear Marc Caira’s message that
positive change is coming at Tim Hortons,” Adam Weiss, co-founder and co-portfolio manager of New York-based Scout
Capital, said in an e-mail.  Activist investors Scout and Highfields Capital Management
LP, which own 5.6 percent and 4 percent of the company’s
outstanding shares respectively according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, both pushed for an increase in leverage and scale-back of unprofitable U.S. operations.  “We look forward to meeting with Mr. Caira and gaining a
better understanding of the actions management intends to take
to realize the company’s potential and generate greater
 shareholder value ,” Weiss said.  Tim Hortons rose 1 percent to C$60.48 at 10:18 a.m. in
Toronto and have gained 24 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
