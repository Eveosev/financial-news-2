Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK) , the second-largest publicly traded U.S. theater operator, said Mexico’s
Federal Competition Commission voted to block the sale of its
cinemas in that country.  The commission voted 3-2 to block the sale to Grupo Cinemex
SA and Cadena Mexicana de Exhibicion SA, Cinemark said yesterday
in a statement.  The deal, announced in February, involved 31 theaters with
290 screens, according to a statement at the time. For the 12
months ended Sept. 30, they generated revenue of $73.7 million
and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of $16.3 million.  The U.S. exhibitor, based in Plano,  Texas , said it plans to
appeal the ruling and will continue to evaluate alternatives.  Cinemark rose 0.5 percent to $31.49 at yesterday’s close in
New York and has gained 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
