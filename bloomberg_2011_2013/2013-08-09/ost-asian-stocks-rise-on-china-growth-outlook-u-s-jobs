Asian  stocks  fell, with the benchmark
index capping its first weekly retreat since June, as  Nikon
Corp. (7731) ’s reduced profit forecast overshadowed a larger-than-estimated increase in China’s industrial output.  Nikon, a Japanese camera maker, slumped 14 percent,
dragging consumer shares lower.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, climbed 1.8 percent in Sydney, leading
raw-materials firms to the largest advance among the 10 industry
groups of the Asia-Pacific benchmark gauge. DeNA Co., a mobile-game site operator, surged 11 percent in  Tokyo  after posting a
9.6 percent increase in first-quarter sales.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.2 percent to 133.57 at
5:34 p.m. in Hong Kong. The gauge retreated 1.5 percent since
Aug. 2, snapping a six-week rally, the longest stretch of gains
since January.  “Earnings expectations are high,” Evan Lucas, a
Melbourne-based market strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a provider
of trading services for equities, currencies and commodities,
said by telephone. “Things had started to get to a top. We need
to see if the Chinese government is in control and pulling the
right levers for the economy.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 7.5 percent from a five-year high on May 20 amid concern a slowdown in Chinese growth
will worsen and as the  Federal Reserve  weighed a reduction in
U.S. stimulus. The gauge gained 3.3 percent this year, compared
with a 19 percent surge on the  S&P 500 .  Regional Gauges  The Asia-Pacific measure traded at 13 times estimated
earnings, compared with 15.4 for the S&P 500 Index and 13.9
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Japan ’s Topix rose 0.1 percent, paring its decline this
week to 4.6 percent. That is the worst weekly performance among
24 developed markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Even after falling for the past three months, the gauge is
still up 33 percent this year, retaining Japan’s position as the
world’s best-performing developed equity market. The measure has
risen amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will push through
reforms while the  Bank of Japan  provides record stimulus.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index added 0.7 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite gained 0.4 percent. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of mainland firms trading in Hong Kong
advanced 1.2 percent. The gauge will extend its decline this
year to 30 percent as China’s manufacturing contracts and bad
loans keep rising, said Guy Stear, Hong Kong-based head of Asia
research at Societe Generale SA.  Markets Closed  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.2 percent as the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia lowered its 2013 growth outlook to
2.25 percent from 2.5 percent as the economy transitions from a
focus on mining investment. South Korea’s Kospi index and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index both retreated 0.2 percent.  Markets in India,  Singapore ,  Malaysia ,  Indonesia , and the
 Philippines  were closed for holidays.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  dropped 0.3
percent. The equity measure climbed 0.4 percent yesterday,
halting a three-day drop, as Chinese trade data topped estimates
and U.S. jobless claims fell.  Reports today showed China’s annual inflation rate remained
at 2.7 percent in July from June and industrial production in
China rose 9.7 percent from a year earlier, exceeding analyst
estimates.  Growth Target  The Chinese government has signaled that it will defend its
7.5 percent economic-growth target for the year after expansion
slowed for a second quarter. China last month announced measures
to support the economy, including ordering companies in 19
industries to curb overcapacity as well as tax cuts for small
firms and aid to exporters. Data yesterday showed exports rose
5.1 percent in July, while imports advanced 10.9 percent.  Claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the four weeks
ended Aug. 3 declined to 335,500 on average, the least since
November 2007, a report showed yesterday. They rose to 333,000
last week, in line with the median forecast of 50 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News , from 328,000 the prior week.  Nikon slumped 14 percent to 1,726 yen in Tokyo after
cutting its full-year net-income estimate by almost a quarter as
demand for compact cameras weakens. Global shipments of compact
digital cameras slid 48 percent in May compared with a year
earlier, according to the Camera & Imaging Products Association
in Tokyo.  Yamada Loss  Yamada Denki Co. tumbled 16 percent to 3,295 yen after the
Japanese electronics retailer reported a loss last quarter.  DeNA surged 11 percent to 2,059 in Tokyo. The gaming
operator reported a 9.6 percent increase in quarterly sales.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Materials Index climbed 0.7 percent,
capping a seventh week of gains.  BHP Billiton  advanced 1.8
percent to A$35.96 and  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s second-largest mining company, added 1.3 percent to A$60.25 in Sydney.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal, rose
5.3 percent to HK$14.22 in Hong Kong.  China Resources Enterprise Ltd., the nation’s No. 2
hypermarket chain, jumped 7.8 percent to HK$25.70 in Hong Kong
after saying it plans to form a venture with Tesco Plc, the
biggest U.K. retailer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
