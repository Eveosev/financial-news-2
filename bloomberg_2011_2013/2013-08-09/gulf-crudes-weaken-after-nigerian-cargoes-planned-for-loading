Light Louisiana Sweet and other  Gulf
of Mexico  crudes weakened relative to West Texas Intermediate as
a loading program showed four Nigerian Bonny crude cargoes will
be loaded next month after none were originally scheduled.  The cargoes will be 950,000 barrels each, according to the
program, which was obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Brent, the European benchmark, saw its premium to WTI
narrow by as much as $1.42 a barrel on the expected increase in
foreign supply. Gulf of Mexico crudes compete with Bonny and
other foreign oils priced against Brent for space in U.S.
refineries.  LLS weakened by 65 cents to a $5.25-a-barrel premium to WTI
at 11:52 a.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened 15 cents to a premium
of $5.25 a barrel.  Mars Blend, a medium, sour crude, weakened by $1 to a
discount of 65 cents a barrel. Poseidon weakened by $1.10 to a
90-cent discount. Southern Green Canyon crude’s discount widened
by 90 cents to $1.75.  Bakken crude in Clearbrook,  Minnesota , strengthened by 50
cents to a $4-a-barrel discount to WTI after Koch Pipeline Co.
restarted a pipeline carrying oil from Clearbrook to two
Minnesota refineries.  In Canada, Syncrude strengthened by 50 cents to a premium
of $3.75 a barrel to WTI, according to Calgary-based energy
broker Net Energy Inc.  Two plants in  Alberta  will be shut for work starting next
month, reducing supplies.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s 97,870 barrel-a-day Scotford refinery will close for most of September, a
person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on July 30.  Husky
Energy Inc. (HSE) ’s 82,000 barrel-a-day Lloydminster upgrader will
shut for 45 days starting in early September, executives said on
an earnings call last month.  Western Canada Select, a blend of heavy crudes, weakened by
10 cents to a $23-a-barrel discount to WTI, according to Net
Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
