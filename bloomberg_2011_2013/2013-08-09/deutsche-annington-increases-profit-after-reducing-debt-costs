Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE (ANN) , the
German residential landlord that sold shares to the public for
the first time last month, said first-half profit rose 35
percent after the company reduced its debt costs.  Funds from operations excluding divestments, a measure of a
property company’s ability to generate cash, climbed to 103.4
million euros ($138 million) from 76.4 million euros a year
earlier, the Bochum-based company said in a statement today. The
landlord said its FFO for the whole year will be 210 million
euros to 220 million euros.  The first-half increase resulted from lower interest
expense owing to the restructuring of the GRAND refinancing and
capital repayments, the company said.  Deutsche Annington, which owns 180,000 apartments in cities
including Berlin and Cologne, is  Germany ’s largest residential
landlord. In December the company received court approval to
restructure its GRAND commercial mortgage-backed security after
more than a year of negotiations with creditors. GRAND was
valued at 5.8 billion euros when it was issued in 2006, making
it  Europe ’s biggest corporate CMBS.  Higher Rents  Deutsche Annington repeated that it would pay a 2013
dividend of about 70 percent of its funds from operations
excluding property sales. The company said it expects to
increase rents by between 1.8 percent and 2 percent in 2013.  Deutsche Annington was down 0.5 percent at 18.16 euros at
the close of trading in  Frankfurt , giving the company a market
value of about 4.1 billion euros.  The former owners, Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd. and
 Apollo Group Inc. (APOL) , raised about 575 million euros in last
month’s initial public offering.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  were lead managers on the IPO.  Net income almost quadrupled in the first half to 436.8
million euros, or 2.18 euros a share, from 111.1 million euros,
or 56 cents, a year earlier, Deutsche Annington said. Rental
income was little changed at 364 million euros as apartment
sales were offset by rising rents and lower vacancies.  Deutsche Annington said all of its GRAND debt has been
repaid with help from a 2.5-billion euro loan from JPMorgan and
Morgan Stanley, and 1.3 billion euros of corporate bonds with
three- and six-year maturities that were issued in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
