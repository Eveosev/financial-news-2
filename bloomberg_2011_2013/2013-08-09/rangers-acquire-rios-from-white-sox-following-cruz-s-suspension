The Texas Rangers acquired outfielder
Alex Rios in a trade with the Chicago White Sox, four days after
losing Nelson Cruz, their leader in home runs and runs batted
in, to a 50-game drug suspension.  The Rangers said in a statement they’ll send a player to be
named and an undisclosed amount of cash to the White Sox for the
32-year-old Rios, who is hitting .277 with 12 home runs, 55 RBI
and 26 stolen bases this season.  A two-time All-Star, Rios joins a team that’s tied with the
Oakland Athletics atop the American League Western Division with
a 65-50 record.  Cruz was leading the Rangers with 27 home runs and 76 RBI
when he was suspended for the rest of the season by Major League
Baseball on Aug. 5 for his connection to Biogenesis of America
LLC, the Miami-area clinic accused of supplying players with
banned performance-enhancing drugs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
