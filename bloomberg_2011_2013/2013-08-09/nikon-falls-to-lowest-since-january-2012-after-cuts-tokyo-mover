Nikon Corp. (7731)  plunged to the lowest in
almost 19 months after yesterday cutting its full-year profit
target by almost a quarter on weaker demand for compact cameras.  The Tokyo-based company  plummeted  14 percent to 1,726 yen
in Tokyo trading, the lowest close since January 2012. The stock
has lost 32 percent this year,  compared  with a 33 percent gain
for the broader Topix index.  Nikon yesterday cut its full-year net income target by 23
percent to 50 billion yen ($517 million) from a 65 billion-yen
forecast in May. The company lowered its operating  profit 
forecast 24 percent to 65 billion yen from 85 billion yen.  “The market may not have expected Nikon to lower full-year
 guidance  at this time, so there may be a negative impact on the
share price over the near term,” Yu Yoshida, a Tokyo-based
analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a note today.  Nikon is looking at ways to tap smartphone growth as a
slump in compact-camera sales may lead to weaker-than-forecast
earnings, President Makoto Kimura said in a July 4 interview.  Global shipments of compact digital cameras slid 48 percent
in May compared with a year earlier, while more expensive
single-lens-reflex cameras, or SLRs, declined about 6 percent,
according to the Camera & Imaging Products Association in Tokyo.  Smartphone shipments jumped 52 percent in the second
quarter to 237.9 million, according to Framingham,
Massachusetts-based IDC Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
