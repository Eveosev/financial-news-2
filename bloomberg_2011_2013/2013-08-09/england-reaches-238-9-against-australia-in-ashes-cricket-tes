England reached 238-9 against
Australia on the opening day of the fourth Ashes cricket Test,
losing eight of the wickets in the afternoon session.  Nathan Lyon led the Australian bowling by taking 4-42 in
Chester-le-Street, England. Captain Alastair Cook scored 51 for
England and Jonathan Trott had 49.  James Anderson  was 16 not out
at the close of play and  Tim Bresnan  was on 12.  England elected to bat after winning the toss, reaching 57-1 at lunch. Lyon dismissed Trott less than an hour after play
resumed and struck three more times -- claiming Kevin Pietersen,
Ian Bell and Jonnny Bairstow -- as England lost six wickets for
just 48 runs in falling to 197-8.  After  Ryan Harris  dismissed Graeme Swann, Bresnan and
Anderson led a late England surge by scoring 24 runs from the
final 20 balls of the day.  England has already retained the Ashes trophy it won two
years ago in Australia after a draw in the third Test followed
wins in the first two games of the five-match series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
