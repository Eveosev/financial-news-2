AR Capital LLC agreed to buy 294
commercial properties from Inland American Real Estate Trust
Inc. for $2.3 billion including debt.  AR Capital made the acquisition on behalf of certain
affiliates, Inland American said in a statement today. The
transaction could generate net proceeds of about $1 billion for
Inland American and will be paid over nine months, the  Oak
Brook , Illinois-based investor said.  “We are very pleased to have reached this agreement, which
represents the culmination of a robust evaluation process to
achieve maximum value for this portfolio of core net lease
assets,” Inland American President Thomas McGuinness said in
the statement.  AR Capital will assume about $795 million of debt as a
result of the deal. The transaction’s value also includes
repayment by Inland American of about $361 million of debt.  Inland American, owner of 45 million square feet (4.2
million square meters) of business properties, will use the
capital raised to reduce debt and invest in stores, lodging and
student housing. It may also buy back shares, according to the
statement.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. acted as financial adviser to
Inland American and Lathan & Watkins LLP provided legal advice
to the investor, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
