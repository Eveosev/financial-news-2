Rheinmetall AG (RHM) , the German armored
vehicle maker, said a plan to cut about 1,000 jobs and focus on
winning overseas business is showing success as the proportion
of orders outside  Europe  rose in the first half.  Defense share of orders booked outside Europe rose to 66
percent in the first six months from 46 percent a year earlier,
the Dusseldorf-based company said in a statement today. Orders
included a 475 million-euro ($636 million) deal to provide
Leopard 2 tanks and self-propelled howitzers to Qatar, and a
military truck sale to  New Zealand  worth 70 million euros.  Rheinmetall is looking to cut about 500 to 550 employees
from its defense business and 470 in its automotive unit in a
plan to make annual savings of 60 million euros to 75 million
euros from 2015. The company said on July 29 that full-year
earnings would miss forecasts as the defense unit would fall
short of sales and profit targets, causing the company’s shares
to drop 11 percent in a day.  “2013 is a year of transition for us, in which we will set
the course for profitable growth in the future,” Chief
Executive Officer Armin Papperger said in the statement. “We
are making good progress in the implementation of our
‘Rheinmetall 2015’ strategy program.”  Rheinmetall shares rose 1.8 percent to 36.55 euros at 9:22
a.m. in Frankfurt trading.  Australia Order  The company has started reducing headcount, with 94 fewer
employees at the end of June than a year earlier.  The turnaround plan has “internationalization” as a
priority along with cost control and product innovation.
Rheinmetall booked a 1.1 billion-euro order from  Australia  for
military vehicles in July. Deliveries of the 2,500 medium and
heavy logistics vehicles are to start from 2016, it said.  Sales declined 8 percent to 2.1 billion euros for the first
six months. The company had a loss before interest and tax of 18
million euros compared with an operating profit a year earlier.  Revenue at the automotive division fell about 1 percent to
1.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
