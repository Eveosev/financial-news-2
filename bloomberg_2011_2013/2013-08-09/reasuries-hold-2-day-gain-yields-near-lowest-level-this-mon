Treasury 10-year note yields traded
in the narrowest range in almost three weeks amid speculation
about whether the Federal Reserve may start to reduce bond
purchases in September.  Benchmark 10-year yields had a weekly drop for the first in
three weeks. The U.S. sold $24 billion of the securities on Aug.
7, part of $72 billion in notes and bond sales this week. The
central bank has been purchasing $85 billion in Treasuries and
mortgages each month in a program known as quantitative easing
to put downward pressure on interest rates.  “There’s remarkably little volatility in the Treasury
market,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We’ve had very
little data of note this week and with no nominal supply until
the last week of August, both attendance and participation have
fallen off quickly. The Fed will taper in September, that’s the
consensus.”  The 10-year note yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.58 percent as of 4:59 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 2.5 percent
security due August 2023 rose 3/32 or $0.94 per $1,000 face
amount to 99 10/32.  The yield traded in a 3.49 basis-point  range , the narrowest
since July 22.  The  30-year (USGG30YR)  yield was at 3.63 percent, the lowest since
July 31. The yield dropped five basis points this week.  Price Swings  Treasury trading volume was $147 billion, the lowest daily
level this year, at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of
U.S. government debt. Volume has averaged $314.24 billion a day
during 2013.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index  was  75.4. It touched
117.89 on July 5, the highest level since December 2010. The
average for 2013 is 67.39.  “You’re waiting for some type of information to give you
an inkling into the time frame that the Fed’s looking at,” said
Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in New
York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “They were looking for
affirmation that the Fed would be tapering in September. We need
a new catalyst from here to generate some movement.”  The Fed will purchase as much as $1.75 billion of
securities due between February 2036 and May 2043 on Aug. 12,
according to the New York Fed’s  website .  The benchmark 10-year yield climbed to a two-year high of
2.75 percent on July 8 from a low this year of 1.61 percent on
May 1. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke rattled markets in May and
June by outlining a plan to end the central bank’s stimulus
program of asset purchases.  Fed View  Fed officials indicated greater willingness this week to
begin tapering stimulus.  “I would clearly not rule” out a decision to start
dialing back the purchases at the Sept. 17-18 gathering of the
Federal Open Market Committee, Chicago Fed President Charles
Evans said on Aug. 6. “We’ve seen good improvement in the labor
market, there’s no question in my mind about that.”  Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto said on Aug. 7 that
“if the labor market remains on the stronger path that it has
followed since last fall, then I would be prepared to scale back
the monthly pace of asset purchases.”  Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher told  Germany ’s business
paper Handelsblatt in an interview that the Fed may start
tapering next month.  Auction Data  Treasury 30-year bonds sold yesterday drew a yield of 3.652
percent. That compared with 3.66 percent at a previous auction
of similar-maturity debt on July 11, which was the highest in
almost two years.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.2 percent of the bonds, compared
with an average of 37.2 percent for the past 10 sales. Primary
dealers purchased 42.7 percent, below the 48.5 percent average
of the past 10 auctions.  The Treasury will auction five-year inflation-indexed debt
on Aug. 22, the day it announces the sizes of two-, five- and
seven-year maturities it is scheduled to auction on three
consecutive days beginning Aug. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
