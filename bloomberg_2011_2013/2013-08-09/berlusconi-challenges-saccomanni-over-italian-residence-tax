Italian Finance Minister Fabrizio
Saccomanni was challenged by Silvio Berlusconi, the
government’s second-biggest backer in parliament, over the
Treasury’s reluctance to abolish a tax on primary residences.  “We must not pay it any longer, from 2013 through all the
years yet to come,” Berlusconi, a three-time former premier and
now a senator, said today in an e-mailed statement. The
disagreement over the tax “is a battle for liberty,” he said.  Berlusconi, 76, was responding to a document published by
Saccomanni late yesterday presenting nine possible adjustments
to the tax, known as IMU. Simply canceling IMU on primary
residences “doesn’t seem fully justifiable” and might be
unfair and inefficient, the finance ministry said.  Berlusconi and his allies are digging in over IMU as the
rival forces in Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s coalition seek to
appeal to voters. Turmoil stemming from Berlusconi’s criminal
tax-fraud conviction, upheld on final appeal last week, is
straining Letta’s three-month-old alliance and raising the
possibility of snap elections.  “We won’t ever come up short on our commitment over IMU,”
Berlusconi said. “It’s a commitment underlying the government
agreement with Prime Minister Letta, but also and above all a
fundamental stimulus to restart our economy.”  Berlusconi has denied wrongdoing in the tax-fraud case,
tied to the purchase of film rights by his Mediaset SpA
broadcaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
