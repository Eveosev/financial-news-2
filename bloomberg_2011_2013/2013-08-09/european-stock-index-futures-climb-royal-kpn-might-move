European stocks  advanced to their
highest level since May as mining companies rallied after a
report showed Chinese industrial production increased at a
faster-than-expected pace.  A gauge of commodity producers posted its biggest increase
in almost 11 months. Royal KPN NV soared the most in 15 months
after billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil  SAB offered to
take over the Dutch phone company. Nestle SA fell for a third
day, for the largest drag on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The Stoxx 600 added 0.6 percent to 305.92 at the close of
trading, extending its advance this week to 0.6 percent. The
equity benchmark has  rallied 11 percent  from a low on June 24 as
the  European Central Bank  and the  Bank of England  said  interest
rates  will remain low for an extended period of time.  “With the upcoming end of the earning season, the market
focus will shift back to the macro side where we most recently
have seen clear signs of improved economic conditions,” said
Anja Hochberg, head of investment strategy at Credit Suisse
Group AG in Zurich. “In  China , we observe stabilizing data
after the more recent weakness.”  The Stoxx 600 climbed yesterday as faster-than-expected
 Chinese exports  outweighed concern that the  Federal Reserve  will
reduce its bond purchases this year.  National benchmark indexes advanced in all 18 western-European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent and
 Germany ’s DAX gained 0.2 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 increased
0.8 percent.  Chinese Economy  In China, a report from the National Bureau of Statistics
showed that  industrial output  rose 9.7 percent in July from a
year earlier, more than the 8.9 percent  median forecast  compiled
by Bloomberg. The world’s second-largest economy grew at an
annualized pace of 7.5 percent in the three months through June,
the fifth consecutive quarter that  gross domestic product  has
grown by less than 8 percent.  Fresnillo Plc and Randgold Resources Ltd., which both mine
precious metals, rose 8.2 percent to 1,035 pence and 6.8 percent
to 4,722 pence, respectively. Lonmin Plc jumped 7.7 percent to
350.5 pence. The Stoxx 600 Basic Resource Index added 4.6
percent, the  best performance  of the 19 industry groups in the
European equity benchmark.  KPN (KPN)  surged 16 percent to 2.32 euros as America Movil
offered 2.40 euros a share for the company. The price -- a 20
percent premium to KPN’s close yesterday -- would value the
stake that America Movil doesn’t already own at 7.2 billion
euros ($9.6 billion). The Mexican mobile-phone operator has a
29.8 percent holding in KPN. An agreement between the two
companies to limit America Movil’s stake to 30 percent expired
after KPN agreed last month to sell its German business E-Plus
to Telefonica SA.  Telekom Austria  Telekom Austria  AG, which is also partly owned by America
Movil, soared 8.7 percent to 5.73 euros.  Stockmann Oyj rallied 6 percent to 12.01 euros as second-quarter net income of 19.5 million euros exceeded the average
analyst projection of 15.4 million euros. The owner of
department stores in Finland and  Russia  also reiterated its
guidance for the year.  Rheinmetall AG advanced 4.5 percent to 37.54 euros as the
German maker of armored vehicles said its defense business won
66 percent of its orders from non-European countries in the
first half of 2013.  The unit  obtained 46 percent of orders from
outside  Europe  in the year-earlier period.  Sky Deutschland AG gained 0.8 percent to 6.60 euros. Credit
Suisse Group AG initiated coverage of the broadcaster with an
outperform rating, meaning that investors should buy the shares.
Credit Suisse said that German households will probably buy
Sky’s services at a faster rate over the next few years. The
company has exclusive rights to screen Bundesliga football
matches. The new Bundesliga season starts tonight.  Nestle Retreats  Nestle slipped 1.3 percent to 62.45 Swiss francs. Deutsche
Bank AG cut its price estimate for the maker of Nescafe by 4.8
percent to 60 francs. The world’s largest food company yesterday
reported its slowest first-half sales growth in four years.  Fugro NV (FUR)  slumped 5.8 percent to 43.90 euros, the worst
performance on the Stoxx 600. The world’s biggest deepwater-oilfield surveyor said  first-half earnings  before interest and
taxes amounted to 133 million euros, compared with 154 million
euros a year earlier. Fugro said that  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was 15
percent greater than the average of the past 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
