Real Goods Solar Inc. (RSOL) , the U.S.
photovoltaic panel installer whose shares have more than tripled
this year, agreed to buy closely held Mercury Energy Inc. to
pursue East Coast customers.  Real Goods will issue 7.9 million shares to acquire Port
Chester, New York-based Mercury, the Louisville, Colorado-based
company said in a statement today. The deal is subject to
approval from both companies’ shareholders. Mercury generated
$35 million in sales last year, has about $10 million in cash
and no debt.  “This acquisition significantly expands our presence as a
major solar solutions provider in key solar markets across the
East Coast,” Real Goods Chief Executive Officer Kam Mofid said
in the statement. “It also strengthens our balance sheet with
additional working capital.”  Real Goods surged 10 percent to $2.29 at the close in  New
York , the most since July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
