Meadowbrook Insurance Group Inc. (MIG) , the
insurer whose rating was cut by A.M. Best Co. last week, delayed
filing a quarterly report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission as the company reviews the size of a goodwill
impairment it will take tied to the downgrade.  “In light of the timing of the downgrade, and the
complexity of the analysis, the company has not had sufficient
time to complete its evaluation,” Southfield, Michigan-based
Meadowbrook said in a filing today. The company said it expects
to file its quarterly report by Aug. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
