China ’s  industrial output  rose 9.7
percent in July from a year earlier and retail sales gained 13.2
percent, the National Bureau of Statistics said on its website
today.  Fixed-asset investment  excluding rural households in the
first seven months of the year increased 20.1 percent, the
Beijing-based agency said.  The advance in industrial production compared with the 8.9
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 47
economists and an 8.9 percent increase in June.  Retail sales 
compared with the median projection for a 13.5 percent advance
and a 13.3 percent increase the previous month.  The median estimate for fixed-asset investment was a 20
percent increase after a 20.1 percent gain in the first half.  Data released earlier today showed  consumer prices  rose 2.7
percent in July from a year earlier, below the government’s 2013
target of 3.5 percent for a seventh month. Producer-prices fell
2.3 percent, the 17th straight monthly decline.  --Scott Lanman. Editors: Nerys Avery, Scott Lanman  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
