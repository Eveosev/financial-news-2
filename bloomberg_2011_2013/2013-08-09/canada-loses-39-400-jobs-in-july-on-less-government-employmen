Canadian employment unexpectedly fell
in July on fewer jobs in government and for youths, and wage
growth declined to its slowest since 2011.  Employment fell by 39,400 last month, while the  jobless
rate  rose to 7.2 percent from 7.1 percent,  Statistics Canada 
said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
projected a 10,000 job gain and an unchanged jobless rate,
according to the median forecasts in surveys with 23 responses.  Canada ’s job gains have slowed so far this year, with the
average monthly gain of 6,000. That’s down from the 27,820
average recorded in the second half of last year. The job report
adds to other evidence of an inconsistent expansion, including a
record string of 18 monthly trade deficits, an economy that grew
by a less than expected 0.2 percent in May and inflation holding
below the central bank’s 2 percent target for more than a year.  “Obviously a disappointing release on the Canadian jobs
front,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at
Scotiabank in Toronto. “It highlights some of the fundamentals
in the economy, that things are very moderate and there is a
lack of confidence.”  Market Reaction  Canada’s currency depreciated on the data, weakening to
C$1.0347 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:21 a.m. in Toronto, from as high
as C$1.0289 immediately before the report. One Canadian dollar
buys 96.64 U.S. cents. Bonds rose, driving the benchmark 10-year
yield lower by two basis points to 2.48 percent.  Employment for youths between ages of 15 and 24 fell by
45,600, while public-sector employment declined by 74,000. Among
industries, the biggest decliners were in health care and public
administration. The  construction industry , which has been among
the strongest sectors this year posting growth of 5.3 percent
through June, lost 6,100 jobs in July.  The jobs figures are unlikely to alter the Bank of Canada’s
outlook, said  Mark Chandler , head of fixed income strategy at
 RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto. While the headline employment
number was worse than expected, private-sector job growth was
“roughly flat,” he said in a telephone interview.  “He was pretty cautious anyway in his first go-around,”
Chandler said of Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, who in
his first policy decision last month left the policy interest
 rate  unchanged and indicated the next move would probably be
higher as slack in the economy disappears.  Spending Cuts  Employment growth should pick up to a pace of about 20,000
new jobs a month as the recovery accelerates, Chandler said.  Companies such as Teck Resources Ltd.,  Goldcorp Inc. (G) ,
Encana Corp. and Suncor Energy Inc. have been cutting spending
plans as firms question the logic of large investments when
commodity prices are weak.  Poloz told reporters July 20 that business executives are
saying they’re still uncertain about foreign demand. CEOs are
telling him “exports are growing but it’s no gangbusters yet
and I’m not sure it’s going to last,” Poloz said.  Manufacturing employment, among decliners through June,
rose 13,500 in July. Full-time employment fell by 18,300 in
July, while part-time positions fell by 21,200, Statistics
Canada said.  While the public sector shed jobs, private companies
increased hiring by 31,400. Workers designated by Statistics
Canada as employees fell by 42,500. The self-employed category
rose by 3,200. Among provinces,  Quebec  led decliners posting a
30,400 drop in employment.  Average hourly  wages  of permanent employees rose 1.35
percent in July from a year earlier, down from 2 percent in June
and the slowest since October 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
