J.C. Penney Co. shareholder  Bill Ackman  said the retailer should replace Chairman Tom Engibous
because the board isn’t functioning effectively.  Major personnel decisions are being made without the input
of the full board and important financial information isn’t
being shared with all directors, Ackman, whose Pershing Square
Capital Management LP is the company’s largest shareholder, said
in a letter to the board obtained by Bloomberg.  The request marks the latest salvo in a feud between Ackman
and his fellow J.C. Penney board members that began yesterday
when the investor publicly released a letter calling for a
speedier process to replace Chief Executive Officer Mike Ullman.
Ackman said today that former J.C. Penney CEO Allen Questrom may
be willing to rejoin the company as chairman even before a new
top executive is chosen.  J.C. Penney, based in Plano,  Texas , fell 3.5 percent to
$13.18 at 10:09 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
