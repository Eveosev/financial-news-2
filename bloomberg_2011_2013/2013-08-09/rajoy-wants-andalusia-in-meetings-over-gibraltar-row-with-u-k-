Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
said that meetings to solve the dispute over Gibraltar should
include officials from the region of Andalusia as well as
representatives of the enclave alongside the U.K. and  Spain .  Andalusia, adjacent to Gibraltar in southern Spain, is
responsible for fishing and environment policy in the area,
Rajoy said in a speech in Palma de Mallorca today after meeting
King Juan Carlos to discuss the row. Spain plans to take
measures to defend its national interest, he added.  “Our priority is to talk through the issues, to negotiate
and reach an agreement that is sensible and civilized,” the
Spanish premier said.  The dispute stems from Gibraltar’s decision in July to
build an artificial reef -- comprising 70 blocks of concrete --
in disputed waters near its airport. That obstructed access to a
shellfishing area for Spanish boats. Rajoy spoke to his U.K.
counterpart  David Cameron  on Aug. 7 and said today he hoped
their respective foreign ministers will discuss the matter again
soon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
