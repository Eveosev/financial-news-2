Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.10 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
ICAP Plc., the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an
e-mailed statement.  The Fed has no Treasury purchases scheduled for today,
which are permanent open market operations.  The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  announced on Aug. 5
that it will this week undertake a series of tri-party reverse
repurchase agreements, which are temporary open market
operations, with all eligible counterparties. The action, part
of a series begun in 2009, doesn’t represent any change in
monetary and is in preparation for the Fed’s eventual withdrawal
of the central bank’s unprecedented monetary stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
