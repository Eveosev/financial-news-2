The pound posted its biggest weekly
gain versus the dollar in a month after a government report
showed the U.K.’s  trade deficit  narrowed in June, adding to
evidence the economic recovery is gathering momentum.  Sterling had its steepest weekly advance against the euro
since April as data this week showed services output expanded
the most in six years in July and  industrial production 
rebounded in June. Britain’s currency strengthened against the
dollar yesterday after Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney 
reiterated policy makers’ commitment to bringing down inflation.
Gilts trimmed a weekly decline.  “The markets have continued to price in the recovery
story, and that’s providing a residual support for sterling
currently,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of foreign-exchange
strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London .  The pound slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5504 as of 4:58 p.m.
London time after rising to $1.5574 yesterday, the highest level
since June 19. It has gained 1.4 percent this week, the most
since the period ended July 12. Sterling strengthened 0.1
percent to 86.02 pence per euro, having appreciated 0.9 percent
this week, the most since April 26.  Carney told BBC Radio 4’s “Today” program that “without
question” inflation at 2 percent is the central bank’s target.  The pound jumped 0.9 percent against the dollar on Aug. 7
as the Bank of England’s  Inflation Report  and review of forward
guidance on  interest rates  fueled speculation the outlook for
growth and inflation will prevent it from keeping borrowing
costs at a record low.  Recovering Economy  The pound has risen 1.1 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies, as reports have signaled the
economy is recovering. The euro rose 3.3 percent and the dollar
gained 0.7 percent.  Britain’s  deficit  on trade in goods narrowed to 8.1 billion
pounds from 8.7 billion pounds in May, the lowest since July
2012, the  Office for National Statistics  said in London. Exports
increased almost 5 percent in the second quarter, the most since
the series began in 1998.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.46 percent after rising to 2.56
percent on Aug. 7, the highest since June 25. The 1.75 percent
bond due September 2022 rose 0.18, or 1.80 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.26. The rate has  increased  three basis
points this week.  U.K. government bonds have lost 3.6 percent this year
through yesterday, Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show. German
securities dropped 1.4 percent and Treasuries declined 2.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
