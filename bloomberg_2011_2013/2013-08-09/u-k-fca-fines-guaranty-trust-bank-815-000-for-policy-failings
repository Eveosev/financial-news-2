Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) ’s British
unit was fined 525,000 pounds ($815,000) by the U.K. markets
regulator for failing to have controls in place to prevent  money
laundering .  The Lagos, Nigeria-based lender’s unit failed to document
risks posed by higher-risk customers when it set up a London
office in 2008, the Financial Conduct Authority said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  “Banks are at the front line in ensuring the proceeds of
crime do not enter the U.K. financial system,” Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement at the FCA, said in the
statement. “GT Bank’s failures were serious and systemic and
resulted in an unacceptable risk of handling the proceeds of
crime.”  Guaranty Trust Bank opened a U.K. office in 2008 offering
retail and wholesale banking to private and corporate clients,
according to the regulator.  “We have fully co-operated with the FCA in its
investigation and we have accepted the findings,” Ade Adebiyi,
managing director of the U.K. unit, said in an e-mailed
statement. “The FCA found no evidence that GTB UK did in fact
handle any proceeds of crime.”  The bank received the FCA’s standard 30 percent discount
for settling early.  To contact the reporter on this story:
