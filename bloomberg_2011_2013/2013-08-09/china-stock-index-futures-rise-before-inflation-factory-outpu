China’s stocks  dropped, paring a
weekly gain, before reports on industrial output and retail
sales. Property developers and smaller companies led declines.  China Vanke Co. (000002)  and Poly Real Estate Group Co. led losses
for developers after the China Securities Journal reported the
government may expand a property tax trial to as many as six
cities. The ChiNext index of small companies slumped 2.7 percent
after valuations approached the highest levels in two years.
 Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111)  climbed 9.4
percent on speculation a government crackdown on illegal mining
of rare earth will boost prices.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 0.6 percent to
2,032.24 at the 11:30 a.m. break, trimming this week’s gain to
0.1 percent. Data on industrial production, fixed-asset
investment and retail sales are due at 1:30 p.m. A report
earlier showed consumer prices rose at a slower-than-estimated
pace in July, while producer prices fell for a 17th month.  “The economic data didn’t surprise investors,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co. in  Shanghai .
“The decline in small-caps hurt sentiment a lot as they are
among the best performers this year. The correction has just
started because valuations are too high.”  The ChiNext has risen 62 percent this year, compared with a
10 percent drop for the Shanghai index.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
