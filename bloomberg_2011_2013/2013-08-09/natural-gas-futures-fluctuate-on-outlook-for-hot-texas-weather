Natural gas futures dropped in New
York to the lowest price in more than five months on speculation
that mild weather will widen an inventory surplus.  Gas slid 2 percent as Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , said the weather may be normal or cooler
than average in most of the lower-48 states through Aug. 23. A
government report yesterday showed that inventories were 0.7
percent above the five-year average in the week ended Aug. 2,
rising to a surplus for the first time since March.  “The weather is pretty mild everywhere except in  Texas ,”
said Tom Saal, senior vice president of energy trading at
FCStone Latin America LLC in Miami. “The inventory situation is
definitely bearish and we’re probably going to continue to see
some larger-than-normal injections into storage.”  Natural gas for September delivery fell 6.7 cents to settle
at $3.23 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest closing price since Feb. 15.
Trading volume was 22 percent above the 100-day average at 2:54
p.m.. Prices have dropped 3.6 percent this year and declined 3.5
percent this week.  The discount of September to October futures widened 0.3
cent to 2.7 cents.  September $2.75 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.1 cent higher at 0.2 cent per
million Btu on volume of 1,163 at 3:10 p.m. Puts accounted for
46 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in September was 31.85 percent at 3 p.m.,
compared with 31.7 percent yesterday.  Inventory Increase  A U.S. supply increase of 96 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Aug. 2 included about 14 billion that was reclassified
from base gas to working gas, the Energy Information
Administration said in a report yesterday. Analysts expected a
gain of 79 billion. The five-year average injection for the week
was 42 billion.  Inventories were 9.2 percent below year-earlier
inventories, compared with 11.5 percent in last week’s report.
Working gas includes supplies available for delivery, while base
gas is used to maintain adequate pressure.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas fell by two
this week to 386, according to data released today by Baker
Hughes Inc. in Houston. The total is down 10 percent this year.  Gas near $3 may boost demand from power plants switching
from pricier coal, said Shiyang Wang, an analyst at Barclays Plc
in New York, in a note to clients today. The futures may rise to
$3.50 or $4 per million Btu as the weather returns to normal,
Barclays said.  Fuel Switching  “We believe coal-to-gas displacement can vary by as much
as 1.5-2 Bcf/d as prices swing from high-$3 to low-$3 levels,”
Wang said in the report.  The high in New York on Aug. 18 may be 76 degrees
Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 7 lower than usual, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,  Pennsylvania . Temperatures in
 Chicago  may reach 75 Fahrenheit, 7 less than average.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Lower-48 state  natural gas output  was little changed in May
as new wells began operating in the Northeast’s Marcellus shale
formation while Wyoming production declined during scheduled
maintenance, government data showed.  Gross gas production in the contiguous states totaled 73.37
billion cubic feet a day, compared with a revised 73.38 billion
in April, the EIA’s monthly  EIA-914  report showed July 31.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first four months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1985, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
