Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  The Daily, Friday, August 9, 2013  Labour Force Survey, July 2013
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130809/dq130809a-eng.htm )  Led by declines among youths, employment decreased by
39,000 in July, and the unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage
points to 7.2%. With this decrease, employment gains have
averaged 11,000 per month over the past six months, slower than
the average of 27,000 observed during the preceding six-month
period.  Since July 2012, employment has increased 1.3% (+226,000).
At the same time, the number of hours worked has grown 0.7%, as
part-time employment rose at a faster pace than full time (+2.2%
versus +1.1%).  Chart: Employment
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130809/cg130809a001-eng.gif )  In July, employment declined in  Quebec , British Columbia,
 Nova Scotia , Manitoba as well as in Newfoundland and Labrador.
At the same time, there were increases in  Alberta , New Brunswick
and Saskatchewan.  Employment was down in health care and social assistance,
public administration and information, culture and recreation.
These declines were partly offset by gains in business, building
and other support services.  There were fewer people working in the public sector in
July, while there was little change in the number of private
sector employees and the self-employed.  Employment declines were concentrated among youths aged 15
to 24, as a result of less hiring this July compared with
previous Julys. There were also declines among women aged 55 and
over, while there was little change among people aged 25 to 54
and men aged 55 and over.  The employment rate of returning students aged 15 to 24 was
similar to that of July 2012. However, fewer students were
working full time.  Chart:  Unemployment rate 
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130809/cg130809a002-eng.gif )  Employment declines in several provinces  In July, the number of workers in Quebec declined by 30,000,
pushing the unemployment rate up 0.3 percentage points to 8.2%.
On a year-over-year basis, employment grew 1.2%, similar to the
national average of 1.3%, with all the growth occurring in the
last five months of 2012.  In British Columbia, there were 12,000 fewer people
employed in July, and the unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage
points to 6.7%. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in
the province was virtually unchanged.  Following three months of little change, employment in Nova
Scotia fell by 4,100 in July. The unemployment rate for the
month was unchanged at 9.0%, as fewer people participated in the
labour market. On a year-over-year basis, employment was little
changed in this province.  Employment in Manitoba was down 3,400 in July, pushing the
unemployment rate up 0.5 percentage points to 5.5%. Compared
with 12 months earlier, employment in the province grew by 1.5%.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, there were 3,000 fewer people
working in July, and the unemployment rate edged up to 11.4%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased by 1.7%.
However, employment in this province has been on a downward
trend since the start of 2013.  In July, employment in Alberta increased by 17,000, the
third notable increase in four months. With this gain, the
unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points to 4.5%. Year-over-year employment growth was 3.0%, the bulk of which occurred in
2013.  Following a decrease in June, employment rose by 4,000 in
 New Brunswick  in July, and the unemployment rate declined 1.0
percentage point to 10.2%. On a year-over-year basis, employment
was little changed.  Employment in Saskatchewan rose for the second consecutive
month, up 3,000 in July. Despite this gain, the unemployment
rate was up 0.3 percentage points to 4.0%, as more people
searched for work. On a year-over-year basis, employment grew by
3.9%, the highest growth rate of all provinces.  In Ontario, employment was little changed in July and the
unemployment rate was 7.6%. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in the province was up 1.2%.  Fewer public sector workers  There were 47,000 fewer people employed in health care and
social assistance in July, following steady growth since May
2012. With the decline in July, employment in this industry is
back to a level similar to that of 12 months earlier.  In public administration, employment fell 23,000 in July.
Compared with July 2012, employment was little changed, as
declines in the past five months offset the gains observed
earlier in the 12-month period.  Employment in information, culture and recreation decreased
for the second consecutive month, down 21,000 in July. As a
result, employment in this industry is down 4.2% or 33,000 from
12 months earlier.  Employment rose by 29,000 in business, building and other
support services in July. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment grew by 6.2% (+43,000), one of the highest growth
rates among all industries.  In July, there were 74,000 fewer people working in the
public sector, as a result of declines in health care and social
assistance and in public administration. At the same time, there
was little change in the number of private sector employees and
the self-employed. On a year-over-year basis, public sector
employment was little changed, while the number of private
sector employees increased 1.5% and the number of self-employed
rose 2.4%.  Fewer youths and women aged 55 and over employed  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 fell by 46,000, as a
result of less hiring this July compared with previous Julys.
Their unemployment rate was little changed at 13.9%, as fewer
youth participated in the labour force. Compared with 12 months
earlier, youth employment was little changed.  In July, employment among women aged 55 and over declined
by 16,000, the first notable decline since July 2012. For men
aged 55 and over, employment was little changed in July.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment for men and women of
this age group increased by 155,000 (+4.8%), partly a result of
population aging.  Among people aged 25 to 54, employment was little changed
in July. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment for this
group edged up 0.5% (+57,000), with all the gains in the last
five months of 2012.  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects labour
market data about young people aged 15 to 24 who were attending
school full time in March and who intend to return to school
full time in the fall. The published data are not seasonally
adjusted; therefore, comparisons can only be made on a year-over-year basis.  Among returning students aged 20 to 24, the employment rate
was 69.7% in July, similar to the rate observed in July 2012.
Their unemployment rate was 9.1%, little changed from the
previous year.  The employment rate for 17- to 19-year-old students was
59.0% in July, similar to the rate observed 12 months earlier.
Their unemployment rate, at 16.8%, was little changed compared
with July 2012.  The labour market for students aged 15 to 16 remained
difficult in July 2013. Their employment rate was 28.6%, the
lowest since 1977, when data became available. The unemployment
rate for these students was 30.0%, similar to the rate observed
12 months earlier.  For the two younger age groups, the prevalence of part-time
work has increased compared with July 2012.  Canada-United States comparison  The unemployment rate in the  United States  was 7.4% in July,
down 0.8 percentage points from 12 months earlier. However, the
US rate remains above the Canadian rate of 6.3% (adjusted to US
concepts). In Canada, the unemployment rate was unchanged from
one year earlier.  In July, the participation rate in the United States was
63.4%, and has declined 2.8 percentage points since 2008. During
the same time, the participation rate in Canada (adjusted to US
concepts) declined 1.2 percentage points to 66.5%, which is 3.1
percentage points higher than the US rate.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a
result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends
observed over longer time periods. Estimates for smaller
geographic areas or industries also have more variability. For
an explanation of sampling variability of estimates and how to
use standard errors to assess this variability, consult the
“Estimates quality” section of the publication Labour Force
Information (71-001-X ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/olc-cel?catno=71-001-X&amp;lang=eng ) ).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/olc-cel?catno=71-543-G&amp;lang=eng ) ).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=eng ) .  Each year, the LFS revises its estimates for the previous
three years, using the latest seasonal factors.  Table: Labour force characteristics by age and sex - Seasonally
