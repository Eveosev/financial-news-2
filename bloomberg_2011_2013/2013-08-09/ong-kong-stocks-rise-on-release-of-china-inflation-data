Hong Kong  stocks  advanced, with the
city’s benchmark heading for its first weekly drop since June,
after China’s consumers prices rose less than expected ahead of
reports on industrial output and retail sales.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 0.5 percent to 21,765.38 as of
9:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, heading for an 2 percent weekly loss.
Three shares climbed for each that fell on the 50-member gauge.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index gained 0.9 percent to
9,568.44.  The  Hang Seng Index  retreated 4.4 percent this year through
yesterday, the biggest decline among major markets tracked by
Bloomberg, amid concern China’s growth is slowing and
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will pare bond purchases. The
gauge traded at 10.31 times estimated earnings yesterday,
compared with 15.39 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Official data today is expected to show the pace of China’s
industrial output growth remained unchanged at an annualized 8.9
percent from a month earlier, according to Bloomberg surveys.
Retail sales figures are due during afternoon trading.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese shares
traded in Hong Kong, also known as the H-share index, has fallen
as much as 27 percent in June from a Feb. 1 high, meeting some
investors’ definition of a bear market.  Materials and energy companies led declines this year
through yesterday on the Hang Seng Composite Index on concern
demand will weaken as China’s economy slows. Utility and
information-technology shares were the biggest gainers.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent. The benchmark
gauge rose 0.4 percent in New York yesterday, halting a three-day drop, as jobless claims fell to the lowest monthly rate
since before the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
