England  won the toss and will bat
first in the fourth Ashes cricket Test against Australia in
Chester-le-Street, England.  England named an unchanged team from the drawn third Test,
which allowed the host to retain the Ashes after winning the
opening two games of the five-match series.  Australia made one change, bringing in seam bowler Jackson
Bird for Mitchell Starc. It will be Birdâ€™s first Ashes Test
match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
