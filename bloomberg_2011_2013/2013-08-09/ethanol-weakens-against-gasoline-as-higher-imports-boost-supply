Ethanol weakened against gasoline on
higher import levels of the biofuel and speculation that a
robust corn crop will lift production.  Gasoline’s premium expanded 8.56 cents to 76.32 cents a
gallon. Imports jumped to 56,000 barrels last week, up from
13,000 the previous week, according to government data.
September ethanol traded at a 25.4-cent premium to the October
contract, which follows the corn harvest.  “The end user doesn’t want to buy this inverse any more
than they have to,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group
in  Chicago . “With the level of imports you’re getting and
what’s likely on the books for this month, it’ll keep August
supply adequate.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery slipped 3.5 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $2.145 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have fallen 2.1 percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery added 5.06 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.9082 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. and farmers have
sought to rebound from last summer’s drought that reduced yields
by planting the most acres since 1936, according to the U.S.
Agriculture Department.  Corn for September delivery fell 7.75 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $4.6575 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively
traded December contract fell 6.5 cents to $4.5325. One bushel
of the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of renewable fuel.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts for the grain and biofuel, was 45 cents,
down from 46 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol  imports  have averaged 22,000 barrels a day through
Aug. 2, up from 12,000 during the same period in 2012, according
to the Energy Information Administration.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.10 a gallon in the
week ended Aug. 2, the lowest price since Oct. 26, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  A 2007 energy law known as the Renewable Fuels Standard
calls for the U.S. to use escalating amounts of ethanol in
gasoline. The government uses Renewable Identification Numbers,
or RINs, the tradable certificates tied to each gallon of
biofuel, to track compliance.  The Environmental Protection Agency said on Aug. 6 that it
would extend the compliance period by four months and signaled
that it may adjust the 2014 targets.  Advanced RINs  Corn-based ethanol RINs  were unchanged at 67 cents.
Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, fell 1 cent to 73 cents.  Ethanol  stockpiles  increased 1.6 percent to 16.7 million
barrels, down 10 percent from a year earlier, data from the
Energy Department’s statistical arm show.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 6 cents to $2.42 a
gallon on the West Coast, 3.5 cents to $2.36 on the  Gulf Coast ,
3.5 cents to $2.26 in Chicago and 5 cents to $2.40 in  New York ,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. West Coast ethanol’s premium to
the Gulf narrowed 2.5 cents to 6 cents, while Chicago’s discount
to New York tightened 1.5 cents to 14 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
