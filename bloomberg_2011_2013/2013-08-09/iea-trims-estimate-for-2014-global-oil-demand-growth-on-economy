The International Energy Agency
trimmed forecasts for global oil demand growth in 2014 amid
slowing expansion in  China  and a struggle to secure a recovery
in the U.S. and Europe.  Global consumption will increase by 1.1 million barrels a
day, or 1.2 percent, to 92 million next year, the Paris-based
adviser to energy-consuming nations said today in its monthly
market report. The expansion is 100,000 barrels a day less than
last month, when the estimate for 2014 was first introduced.
Refinery operating rates will ease after a record surge in July,
the IEA said.  “Everyone knows that supply is growing faster than demand
into next year and the overall perception is that prices will
soften,” Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB AB
in Oslo, said by phone before the report. “We’re not really
finding a big bullish driver for oil.”  Brent crude lost about 4 percent this year, trading near
$107 a barrel today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London , amid deceleration in China and elevated unemployment
rates in the U.S. and Europe. The IEA’s outlook incorporates
lower projections from the Washington-based International
Monetary Fund, which on July 9 cut global economic growth
forecasts next year to 3.1 percent from 3.3 percent.  Strength Signs  There have been recent “signs of strength” in oil markets
with a 3.1 million barrels a day surge in world refinery
operating rates in June and demand recovery in the U.S., the IEA
said.  Demand for crude produced by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will shrink by 400,000 barrels a day next
year to 29.4 million a day as higher output from other nations,
such as the U.S. and  Canada , exceeds the expansion in global oil
consumption, the agency said.  Production from OPEC’s 12 members fell by 165,000 barrels a
day last month to 30.41 million a day, the lowest in six months,
amid supply disruptions in Libya and  Iraq , according to the IEA.
The North African nation’s output slipped to 1 million barrels a
day, while the Persian Gulf state’s fell to 2.99 million.
Supplies from Saudi Arabia, the group’s biggest member and de
facto leader, increased by 150,000 barrels a day in July to a
one-year high of 9.8 million.  The decline still leaves OPEC output about 400,000 barrels
a day higher than the amount the IEA estimates will be needed
from the group in the third quarter, and the organization’s own
formal target, at 30 million a day. OPEC, which accounts for
about 40 percent of global supplies, will meet next to review
production targets on Dec. 4.  Non-OPEC Supply  The agency kept estimates for supplies from outside the
group in 2014 unchanged. Non-OPEC producers, led by the U.S.,
Canada and  Brazil , will bolster production by 1.4 million
barrels a day, or 2.6 percent, next year to 55.9 million a day.  The IEA also kept its projection for world oil demand in
2013 mostly unchanged. Consumption will rise by 895,000 barrels
a day this year to 90.8 million, amounting to a reduction of
70,000 barrels a day from last month’s report.  Total inventories  of crude and refined products in
industrialized nations were above their five-year average after
increasing in June, the agency said. Stockpiles in members of
the Organization for Cooperation and Development rose by 11.9
million barrels to 2.7 billion in June, leaving them 39 million
barrels above the mean.  -- Editors: Raj Rajendran, Stephen Voss  To contact the reporter on this story:
