Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai are heading for a second weekly advance as  iron ore 
rallied and China boosted spending on railway projects.  Rebar for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
was little changed at 3,744  yuan  ($612) a metric ton at 10:07
a.m. local time, after swinging between 3,736 yuan and 3,750
yuan. The price is up 1.8 percent this week.  China’s state-owned railway company will spend more than 50
billion yuan in its first large-scale train purchases to meet
rising transport demand even as the economy slows, Xinhua News
Agency reported earlier this week.  Iron ore  for immediate
delivery rose for a fourth day on Aug. 7, adding 1.3 percent to
$133.10 a dry ton, the highest since April 30, according to a
 price index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  “Rebar has entered a strong phase, supported by higher
production costs and expectations that the government will boost
investment in infrastructure to stabilize growth,” said Wang
Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing CIFCO Futures Co. in Tianjin.  The average spot price of rebar advanced 0.7 percent to
3,499 yuan a ton yesterday, rising for a fourth day, according
to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
