The drug-testing laboratory that
would be responsible for Olympic and soccer World Cup testing in
Rio de Janeiro had its accreditation suspended by the  World
Anti-Doping Agency .  The suspension of LAB DOP-LADETEC/IQ-UFRJ Doping Control
Laboratory, known as LADETEC, was effective two days ago and
prohibits the lab from carrying out any anti-doping activities
for WADA, which announced the ban in an e-mailed news release
yesterday.  WADA, based in  Montreal , didn’t say why the lab’s
accreditation was suspended, other than it didn’t meet the
requirements of the International Standard for Laboratories.  WADA’s executive committee will make a later decision on
whether to revoke LADETEC’s accreditation, and the lab has the
right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport within the
next 21 days.  The only other South American  WADA-accredited lab  for
doping control analysis is based in Bogota. There are 33
worldwide, including LADETEC.  The  World Cup  begins June 12, 2014, and the Olympics will
be held in Rio in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
