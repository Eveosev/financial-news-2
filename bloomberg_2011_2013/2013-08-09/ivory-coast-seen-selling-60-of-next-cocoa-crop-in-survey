Ivory Coast , the world’s leading
cocoa producer, already may have sold 60 percent of total output
forecast for the 2013-14 season, according to a Bloomberg survey
and  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)   Cocoa sales by the West African nation’s industry regulator
Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao, known as CCC, may have reached 845,000
metric tons, the mean in a Bloomberg survey of 15 brokers,
traders, analysts and processors showed. Farmers in Ivory Coast
will reap 1.42 million tons of cocoa in the season starting in
October, down from 1.455 million tons in 2012-13, estimates  Kona Haque , a London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.,
Australia’s biggest investment bank.  “The next crop has been pretty well sold this far in
advance and should take some harvest pressure off the market,”
said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures Group Inc.
in Chicago. “That means less downside potential this fall and
maybe somewhat higher prices later into the winter.”  Ivory Coast implemented changes to the cocoa sector last
year that include selling part of the crop before harvesting
starts and setting a fixed price to be paid to farmers. The
sales are made through twice-daily auctions. Cocoa for shipment
from October to December was for sale at today’s morning auction
at a minimum price of 1,276  CFA francs  ($2.59) a kilogram (2.2
pounds), CCC data showed. That equates to a premium of 30 pounds
($47) a ton over the December futures in  London .  Cocoa for September delivery jumped 5.2 percent this week
on NYSE Liffe and yesterday reached 1,685 pounds a ton, the
highest for the contract since Sept. 17. There is concern that
West African crops will be delayed and reduced by dry weather
and that Ivory Coast already sold much of next season’s crop.  Stressed Crops  Ivory Coast’s Daloa region, which produces about 300,000
tons of cocoa a year, got 0.1 millimeter (0.004 inch) of rain
from July 21-31, according to the National Meteorological
Service. That compares with the long-term average of 42
millimeters. Dryness is set to persist in Ivory Coast and  Ghana ,
continuing to stress crop development, MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Ghana, the world’s second-biggest producer, offered to sell
beans from its next crop this week as futures rallied, three
traders with direct knowledge of the sales said yesterday. The
Ghana Cocoa Marketing Co., which manages sales on behalf of
industry regulator the Ghana Cocoa Board, offered beans at a
premium of about 80 to 90 pounds a ton above the price of the
May futures traded on NYSE Liffe, said the traders.  Cocoa for September delivery fell 0.4 percent to 1,649
pounds ($2,559) a ton by 1:40 p.m. in London.  -- With assistance from Marley Delduchetto in Chicago. Editor:
