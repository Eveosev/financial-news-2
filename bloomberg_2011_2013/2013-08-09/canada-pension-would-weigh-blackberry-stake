Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board’s Chief Executive Officer  Mark Wiseman  said he would
consider an investment in BlackBerry Ltd. if the smartphone
maker decided to go private.  “It’s safe to say that any large deal in Canada or
elsewhere is something that we would make sure we took a hard
look at,” Wiseman said in a phone interview today when asked
about BlackBerry. “You could say that about that asset.”  Canada Pension has invested and benefited from technology
companies in the past. It more than tripled a $300 million
investment in Skype Technologies SA in two years before selling
the stake in 2011 to  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  The Toronto-based fund
manager had invested in Skype with private-equity firms
including Silver Lake Management LLC.  BlackBerry is considering going private as a way to turn
the company around, Reuters reported earlier today.  Canada’s second-largest pension  fund manager  had C$188.9
billion of assets and manages retirement savings for 18 million
people in every province except for Quebec.  To contact the reporters on this story:
