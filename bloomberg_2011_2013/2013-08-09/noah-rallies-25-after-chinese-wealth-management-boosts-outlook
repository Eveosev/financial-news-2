Noah Holdings Ltd. (NOAH) , a Chinese wealth-management company, jumped to the highest level in more than two
years in New York after raising its 2013 profit estimate.  Noah’s American depositary receipts surged 25 percent to
$16.28 as of 12:53 p.m., gaining the most since February 2012.
They earlier soared as much as 27 percent. Trading volume was
six times the daily average over the past three months, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The Shanghai-based company raised its 2013 adjusted net
income forecast to as much as $55 million in a statement
yesterday, 49 percent more than an estimate of up to $37 million
given on May 6. Noah is scheduled to report second-quarter
earnings on Aug. 21.  “We were surprised by Noah’s big upside revision to its
2013 profit guidance, which was far ahead of our previous
estimate,” Ella Ji, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in  New
York , said by phone. “The big growth is likely to benefit from
its good performance in real-estate fund management business.”  Ji raised Noah to outperform, an equivalent to buy, from
market perform in a note, setting a price target of $18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
