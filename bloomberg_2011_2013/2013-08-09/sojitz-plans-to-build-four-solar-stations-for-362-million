Sojitz Corp. (2768) , a Japanese trading
company, will enter the country’s solar power market with plans
to invest 35 billion yen ($362 million) to build four plants.  They will have a combined capacity of 106 megawatts
including a 71 megawatt station in Aomori prefecture, which will
be completed by the end of 2016, the Tokyo-based company said
today in a statement.  Sojitz will also build a 9 megawatt plant in Hokkaido and
plans two more in Aichi and Kumamoto, which will be 13 megawatts
each, according to the statement.  They will be the company’s first solar projects in Japan,
according to Sojitz spokeswoman Megumi Kawaguchi. Sojitz has a
24 megawatt station in  Germany .  The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier today that South
Korea’s  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  will supply panels for all four
plants. Kawaguchi said the company hasn’t decided on suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
