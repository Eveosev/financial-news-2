Thailand ’s 10-year government bonds
snapped a three-week decline and the baht rose as data from
 China  eased concern  Asia ’s largest economy is slowing.  The 10-year yield fell to the lowest level in more than a
week and the baht rebounded from the weakest in a month as
China, Thailand’s biggest export market, yesterday reported
overseas  shipments  rose 5.1 percent in July, after a 3.1 percent
drop in June. Thailand’s parliament passed the first reading of
an amnesty bill yesterday for political prisoners and those
facing charges related to government protests after a 2006 coup
that toppled then-prime minister  Thaksin Shinawatra .  “China’s data lifted sentiment in the market,” said
Pareena Phuangsiri, a Bangkok-based analyst at Kasikornbank Pcl.
“The fact that there’s no intensity in the political situation
so far also gave a short-term boost, but investors will still be
cautious about the situation.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent sovereign bonds due June
2023 dropped 10 basis points this week to 3.93 percent as of
9:30 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate, little changed today, was at its lowest level since
July 29.  The baht advanced 0.1 percent for the five days from Aug 2.
and for today to 31.23 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 31.49 on Aug. 7, the weakest level since
July 8. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, declined five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.2 percent today,
erasing this week’s rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
