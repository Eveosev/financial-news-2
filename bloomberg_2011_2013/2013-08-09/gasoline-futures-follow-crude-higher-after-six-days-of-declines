Gasoline rose after six consecutive
days of losses as crude oil strengthened after  China  reported
that industrial output expanded faster than anticipated and U.K.
exports jumped.  Futures rose as much as 1.3 percent. Chinese  factory
production  grew 9.7 percent in July from a year ago, government
data showed today, compared with the 8.9 percent median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. U.K. exports rose to a
record 78.4 billion pounds ($122 billion) in June. West Texas
Intermediate for September delivery rose as much as 1.4 percent.  “The gasoline price this morning is being supported by
crude oil, which is seeing good economic headlines out of the
U.K. and China overnight,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Houston-based Lipow Oil Associates LLC.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 1.86 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.8762 a gallon at 9:58 a.m. on the  New York

the 100-day average.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude fell 61 cents to $16.01 a barrel. Gasoline’s
