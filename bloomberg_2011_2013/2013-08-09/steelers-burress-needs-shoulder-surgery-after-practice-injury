Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver
 Plaxico Burress  sustained what appears to be a “significant
shoulder injury” during practice and will be out indefinitely,
coach  Mike Tomlin  said.  “He is scheduled for surgery on Monday, and we will re-evaluate the injury at that time,” Tomlin said in a statement
on the team’s website. The injury occurred yesterday.  Burress, who turns 36 on Aug. 12, the day of the operation,
played three games with the Steelers in 2012 after spending the
2011 National Football League season with the New York Jets.  He was out of football in 2009 and 2010, serving 20 months
in jail on a weapons charge after shooting himself in the leg
while a member of the  New York  Giants.  Having played his first five seasons in Pittsburgh before a
four-year stint with the Giants, Burress has 8,499 receiving
yards and 553 receptions for his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
