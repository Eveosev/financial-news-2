Benin ’s president, Thomas Boni Yayi,
fired his entire cabinet to accelerate reforms aimed at
alleviating poverty in the West African nation, his office said.  The dismissal of the government comes as “new issues
challenge” the country, Emmanuel Tiando, secretary-general in
the presidency, said in remarks broadcast today on state
television in the commercial capital, Cotonou.  “These new challenges focus on the need for further
reforms in the spirit of cohesion and determination and require
injecting a dynamic into a new government,” Tiando said. A new
government will be appointed soon, he said, without specifying a
date.  Yayi Boni, 61, has ruled Benin, situated between Nigeria
and Togo and known as the birthplace of voodoo, since 2006 and
won a second term in office in 2011. In March, Beninese
authorities said they foiled an attempted coup, the second in
five months. A businessman and an army commander were arrested
for plotting to install a military regime in the country.  Benin’s $7.3 billion economy relies on agriculture
including cotton to generate more than a third of total output
and provides employment for 70 percent of its workforce,
according to the  African Development Bank . About a third of the
country’s citizens live in poverty, according to the CIA World
Factbook.  Yayi Boni thanked members of his cabinet who had​“efforts
to contribute to the success of our country to development,”
Tiando said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
