Canadian housing  starts  fell less
than economists forecast in July as work on multiple units such
as condominiums was little changed, the federal housing agency
said today.  Work began on 192,853 homes at a seasonally adjusted annual
pace last month, down 0.5 percent from a revised 193,797 in
June, Ottawa-based  Canada  Mortgage & Housing Corp. said in a
statement. Economists anticipated a reading of 190,000,
according to the median of 22 responses in a Bloomberg News
 survey .  Today’s figure is 9.5 percent below the pace a year ago.
Canada’s housing-market data are showing few signs of a hard
landing even amid policy-maker warnings that a bubble may have
been forming. Home sales in Toronto and  Vancouver , Canada’s two
largest real estate markets, soared in July, the cities’ real-estate boards reported last week.  Multiple-unit housing starts in urban areas slipped 0.2
percent in July to a pace of 114,311, a decline of 7.2 percent
from the same month a year ago, according to the CMHC report.
Single-unit work dropped 5.5 percent to 58,731 units, down 13
percent on a yearly basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
