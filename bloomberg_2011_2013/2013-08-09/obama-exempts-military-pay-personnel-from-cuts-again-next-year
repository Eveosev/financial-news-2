The White House budget director
notified Congress today that President  Barack Obama  intends to
exempt military personnel from automatic budget cuts known as
sequestration again next year.  The exemption is “considered to be in the national
interest to safeguard the resources necessary to compensate the
men and women serving” the nation and “to maintain the force
levels required for national security,” Office of Management
and Budget Director Sylvia Burwell wrote Vice President  Joe Biden  in his role as president of the Senate.  Burwell said “this action would trigger a higher reduction
in non-exempt accounts.”  The Pentagon’s $526.6 billion budget request for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1, not including war funds, would provide
$137.1 billion to cover pay, incentives, moving allowances and
funds set aside for military retirement.  Obama exempted military pay and benefits from this year’s
cuts, which took effect in March. The Pentagon is being required
to cut $37 billion by the end of the current fiscal year on
Sept. 30.  Of that, $20 billion will come from operations and
maintenance accounts and $17 billion from weapons research and
procurement. The Pentagon faces $52 billion more in
sequestration reductions for fiscal 2014.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned last week that the
Pentagon will be forced to choose between a decade-long
“modernization holiday” and a “much smaller” force if the
military has to absorb cuts adding up to more than $500 billion
over a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
