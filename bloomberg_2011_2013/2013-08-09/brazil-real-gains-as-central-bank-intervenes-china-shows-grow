(Corrects third paragraph to say auctioning swaps.)  Brazil ’s real rose, extending its
first weekly gain since mid-July, as the central bank intervened
and  China , the Latin American nation’s biggest trading partner,
reported higher-than-forecast industrial output.  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.2769 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:30 a.m. in Sao Paulo, extending its gain this week
to 0.5 percent. Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015
were unchanged at 9.63 percent today and have fallen nine basis
points this week.  Brazil’s real was the best performer today among major
Latin American currencies after the central bank announced that
it was auctioning foreign-exchange swaps in its 23rd day of
intervention since May 31. The currency climbed earlier as
China’s report on industrial output signaled stronger demand for
Brazilian exports.  “The market was surprised by the data from China,”
Reginaldo Siaca, the head of  currency trading  at Advanced
Corretora de Cambio in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.
“This could give the real some gas.”  China’s industrial output rose 9.7 percent in July,
compared with the 8.9 percent median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The Asian nation was the destination for
20 percent of Brazil’s total exports and the source of 15
percent of its imports in the first seven months of 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
