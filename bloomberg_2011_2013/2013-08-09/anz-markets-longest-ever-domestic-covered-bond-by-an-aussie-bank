Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ)  sold the longest-tenor covered bonds on record by a
domestic lender in Australia.  The Melbourne-based bank priced A$700 million ($638
million) of the 5 percent notes maturing Aug. 16, 2023, to yield
100 basis points more than the swap rate, according to an e-mailed statement from the issuer which self managed the sale.
The debentures are expected to have AAA  credit ratings .  The transaction follows ANZ’s sale yesterday of A$1.75
billion of four-year non-covered securities, which were priced
at 85 basis points above the bank bill swap rate. ANZ’s previous
sale of covered securities in Australia was a four-year
transaction in March 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Covered bonds, which are backed by the borrower and
mortgages that stay on its balance sheet, were last issued in
 Australia  by Royal Bank of Canada on July 30, the first issue
since a sale by Brisbane-based Suncorp-Metway Ltd. in November.  The notes are a form of issuance that was pioneered in 18th
century Prussia. They typically carry top credit ratings and
tend to be issued at narrower spreads than debt that isn’t
backed by collateral.  Australian banks embarked on their first domestic sales of
covered bonds after the government passed legislation in 2011.
The longest duration covered bonds sold in Australia by domestic
lenders prior to today have been five-year notes, Bloomberg-compiled data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
