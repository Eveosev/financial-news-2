Australia ’s dollar had its biggest
weekly gain since 2011 after industrial output data today added
to signs of economic stabilization in  China , the South Pacific
nation’s largest trading partner.  The currency rose for a fifth day as the Reserve Bank
damped expectations for further easing after cutting its key
 interest rate  to a record low this week. In its Statement on
 Monetary Policy  today, the central bank reduced its outlook for
growth.  New Zealand ’s dollar maintained a three-day climb.  “The industrial production number was the one that
everyone was looking for; it’s been a good read on the real
economy and it blew expectations out of the water,”said  Chris Weston , chief market strategist at IG Markets Ltd. in  Melbourne .
“This is good news for Australia.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.5 percent to 91.46 U.S. cents at
5:15 p.m. in Sydney, after touching 91.54, the highest since
July 30. It has gained 2.7 percent this week, the most since
December 2011. New Zealand’s currency was little changed at
80.14 U.S. cents, after reaching 80.47 yesterday, the most since
July 29. It has advanced 2.3 percent since Aug. 2.  Against the yen, the Aussie rose 0.5 percent to 88.49,
while the kiwi advanced 0.1 percent to 77.53.  Australia’s 10-year bond yields climbed four basis points
to 3.71 percent, while three-year yields rose four basis points
to 2.53 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Industrial production in China rose 9.7 percent in July
from a year ago, accelerating from the previous month, and
outpacing the median economist estimate for an 8.9 percent
advance in a Bloomberg News survey.  RBA Report  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia said in its quarterly policy
outlook that gross domestic product will grow 2.25 percent in
the year to December 2013, compared with 2.5 percent forecast
three months earlier. Core consumer prices will rise 2.25
percent in the year to June 2014, below the mid-point of the
central bank’s 2 percent to 3 percent target.  “There was little forward guidance but we would argue that
this is captured in the macro forecasts as well as the
highlighted risks,” Su-Lin Ong, Sydney-based head of Australian
economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “An implicit easing bias
is evident.”  The release comes three days after the RBA cut the key rate
to an all-time low of 2.5 percent. Governor  Glenn Stevens  said
in a statement after the decision that the board “will continue
to assess the outlook and adjust policy as needed to foster
sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent
with the inflation target over time.”  Rate Bets  The reduction was the second this year, and extends an
 easing cycle  that began in November 2011, when the benchmark
rate was lowered from 4.75 percent.  Traders see 60 percent odds that the RBA will cut its
benchmark again this year,  interest-rate swaps  data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The perceived likelihood of rates being less
than 2.5 percent by December was 72 percent on Aug. 7.  The Aussie has fallen 9.7 percent in the past three months,
the most among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The kiwi was the second-biggest loser, with a 4.2 percent decline.  Traders held record positions betting on declines in the
Aussie versus the  U.S. dollar  last week, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.
The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other
large speculators on a drop compared with those on a gain -- so-called  net shorts  -- was 72,573 on July 30, compared with shorts
of 63,982 a week earlier.  “The market has been very, very short Aussie dollar, and
the Aussie has certainly become more and more prone to a
correction,” said Derek Mumford, a director at Rochford
Capital, a currency risk-management company in Sydney. “I
wouldn’t be surprised to see the Aussie dollar up to 92, 92 1/2
U.S. cents over the next few days.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
