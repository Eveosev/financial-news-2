Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) , the
studio behind the  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  series “Orange Is the New
Black,” rose to a record in late trading yesterday after it
posted quarterly results that beat analysts’ estimates on TV and
home entertainment gains.  Shares in the company rose 3.6 percent to an all-time high 
of $35.47 after the results yesterday. The stock had gained 0.6 
percent to $34.23 at the close in New York.  Net income amounted to $13.6 million, or 10 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $44.2 million, or 33 cents, a year
earlier, the Vancouver-based studio, also the producer of TV’s
“Mad Men,” said in a statement yesterday. Excluding some items
profit totaled 18 cents, double the 9-cent average of five
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Orange Is the New Black,” a comedy about a women’s
prison, began showing July 11 on Netflix, which has already
ordered a second season. Films released in the period included
“Now You See Me,” a thriller about magicians who pull off a
bank heist. It has taken in $233 million worldwide on a budget
of $75 million, according to researcher Box Office Mojo.  Sales rose 21 percent to $569.7 million in the quarter
ended June 30, beating the $523 million average of nine
estimates.  Shares of Lions Gate, run from Santa Monica,  California ,
have more than doubled this year, compared with a 19 percent
gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  (Lions Gate plans a conference call at 9 a.m. New York time
