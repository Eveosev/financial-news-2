Copper pared a weekly advance as
investors weighed  China ’s smaller-than-expected inflation rate
and ahead of industrial output data due today.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.6 percent to $7,141.25 a metric ton at 11:25 a.m.
in  Shanghai . The metal has climbed 2 percent this week.  China’s July consumer price index rose 2.7 percent from a
year earlier, smaller than a 2.8 percent projection, while
producer prices fell 2.3 percent from a year earlier, compared
with a median estimate of 2.1 percent. China releases data for
industrial production this afternoon.  “The CPI data is a bit disappointing because that also
mirrors relatively weak social consumption in China,” said Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co.  Eight traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect
copper to rise next week, five were bearish and six neutral,
according to a Bloomberg survey. The LME benchmark contract rose
to an eight-week high yesterday after imports by China climbed
to a 14-month high.  Copper for delivery in September on the Comex in  New York 
lost 0.5 percent to $3.2555 a pound. Copper for delivery in
November on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was little changed at
51,530  yuan  ($8,424) a ton.  On the LME, nickel, aluminum and zinc fell. Tin was little
changed at $21,685 a ton after a seven-day rally and is the
best-performing base metal this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
