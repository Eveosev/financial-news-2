Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) ,  Japan ’s largest
shipping line, said it was accused in a lawsuit in Ontario,
 Canada , of fixing prices on car-carrier services.  Ryan Todd Wonch and Margaret A. Wonch contend in a lawsuit
that Nippon Yusen conspired to fix prices of car transportation
and are seeking damages, according to a statement from the
Tokyo-based company today. Nippon Yusen said the amount they are
being sued for wasn’t mentioned.  Last month, a lawsuit was filed by a Florida-based shipping
company after raids by Japanese antitrust regulators last year
at the offices of Nippon Yusen and four other shipping lines.
The companies, which together control about 70 percent of the
global market for carrying cars, said at the time that the
search was in connection with a probe of price-fixing claims.  Nippon Yusen said it was reviewing the lawsuit and will
take appropriate measures, according to the statement. The
company said it was unclear whether there would be any effect on
earnings from the case.  To contact the reporters on this story:
