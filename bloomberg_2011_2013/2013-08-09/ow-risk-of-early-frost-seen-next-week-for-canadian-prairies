The likelihood of an early frost
striking farms in the Canadian Prairies is “relatively low” as
cool temperatures are expected to rebound next week and into
late August,  Environment Canada  said today.  Temperatures across Saskatchewan, Manitoba and  Alberta , the
three provinces that grow the bulk of  Canada ’s cereal crops,
will not slide below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit)
in the next week, Ross Macdonald, a meteorologist with
 Environment Canada , said in a telephone interview from
 Vancouver . Lower daytime temperatures will rebound to the mid-20
degrees Celsius range across the Prairies. The risk of freezing
in August remains low, since there is no arctic air coming from
the north, Macdonald said.  Cool, wet weather is delaying crop development in
 Saskatchewan , Canada’s largest grower of spring wheat and
canola, the province said on Aug. 8. A return to warm weather
will help advance corn and soybean crops in  Manitoba , the
province’s agriculture ministry said Aug. 6.  “For the most part, the Prairies look relatively safe,”
Macdonald said. “It’s not going to be abominably hot, but
there’s no real arctic air that’s going to be coming down and
chilling things off.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
