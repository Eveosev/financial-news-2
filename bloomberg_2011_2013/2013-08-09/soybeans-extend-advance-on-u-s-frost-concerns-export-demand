Corn futures slumped to the lowest in
almost three years on speculation that favorable weather will
boost prospects for a record crop in the U.S., while expanding
harvests from  Brazil  to Ukraine boost global supplies.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for December
delivery fell 1.4 percent to close at $4.5325 a bushel at 1:15
p.m., Earlier, the price touched $4.52, the lowest for a most-active contract Sept. 3, 2010. Bets by  hedge funds  on a slump

billion bushels (356.5 million metric tons) from a year earlier,
the average of 27 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.

another survey showed. Temperatures during the second half of
August may rise above normal in the U.S. Midwest, aiding crop
development slowed by cool weather, World Weather Inc. said.  “The forecast looks nearly ideal for boosting corn grain
weights,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at Archer
Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The growth in production outside the U.S. is going
to slow demand” for domestic supplies this year,” he said.  The U.S. government is scheduled to update its crop
forecasts on Aug. 12. The nation was the world’s top exporter
last year, followed by Brazil.  Goldman Forecast  Surging supply spurred analysts from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to cut their price forecasts, and R.J. O’Brien & Associates

low as $3.50 a bushel this year. Speculators turned bearish a

Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the largest processor of the grain,
and Tyson Foods Inc., the biggest U.S. meat processor. Declining
feed costs may help cap global meat prices, which rose to within
2 percent of a record in June, according to data from the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization in Rome.  Some fields in  Nebraska ,  Iowa ,  South Dakota  and  Minnesota 
will get as much as 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) of  moisture  in
the next three days, aiding crops, according to the  National
Weather Service . Precipitation in parts of the states was 50
