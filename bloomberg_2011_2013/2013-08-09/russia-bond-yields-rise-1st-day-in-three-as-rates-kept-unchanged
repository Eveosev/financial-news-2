Russian government bond yields rose
for the first time in three days after Bank Rossii left its main
lending rates unchanged amid above-target inflation.  Yields on the benchmark OFZ due February 2027 climbed as
much as eight basis points and closed up three points at 7.68
percent. The ruble was little changed at 37.8416 against Bank
Rossii’s dollar-euro basket by 6 p.m. in Moscow, when the
central bank stops its market operations, leaving the weekly
decline at 0.4 percent.  Bank Rossii kept the refinancing rate at 8.25 percent at a
monetary policy meeting in Moscow, the regulator said on its
website today. That matched the median estimate of 20 economists
in a Bloomberg survey, while eight called for a cut of 25 basis
points. Brent oil ended five days of declines, rising 0.9
percent to $107.66 per barrel.  “The market reacted with a correction in longer-dated
OFZs,” Mikhail Vashchenko, a fixed-income portfolio manager at
Kapital Asset Management LLC, said by e-mail. “A number of
players expected rate cuts.”  Annual inflation slowed to 6.5 percent on Aug. 5 and it
will fall into the central bank’s target range of 5 percent to 6
percent in the second half of this year, according to the Bank
Rossii statement accompanying the decision. The rate will
continue to fall in 2014, policy makers said.  “For us the rates decision was quite expected, but someone
in the market must have been hoping for a miracle,” Evgeny Shilenkov, head of fixed-income trading at Veles Capital in
Moscow, said by phone.  Gross domestic product expanded 1.2 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier compared with 1.6 percent in the
first quarter, data from the Federal Statistics Service showed
today. That missed the median forecast of 2 percent and was
below all 19 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  The ruble weakened 0.1 percent against the dollar for the
day and for the week to 32.8750. The Russian currency was little
changed against the euro today at 43.9100, depreciating 0.7 for
the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
