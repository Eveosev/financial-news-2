GMP Capital Inc. (GMP) ,  Canada ’s second-biggest non-bank brokerage, returned to profit in the second
quarter after selling part of its wealth-management business.  Net income was C$4.78 million ($4.6 million) compared with
a loss of C$376,000 a year earlier, the Toronto-based firm said
today in a statement. Revenue fell 3.8 percent to C$60.3
million.  GMP said it lost 2 cents a share in the quarter after
excluding some items, missing the break-even average  estimate  of
four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Market conditions remained challenging for the quarter,
driven by very low levels of activity in the resource sectors,”
Chief Executive Officer Harris Fricker said in the statement.  The firm agreed in January to sell funds including GMP
Diversified Alpha Fund and the Canadian ABCP Fund to  Fiera
Capital Corp. (FSZ)  for C$10.8 million. The transaction was completed
on May 1.  (GMP will hold a conference call to discuss quarterly
results at 10 a.m. Toronto time at +1-416-644-3414 or 1-800-814-4859 or at  http://www.gmpcapital.com/investor )  To contact the reporter on this story:
