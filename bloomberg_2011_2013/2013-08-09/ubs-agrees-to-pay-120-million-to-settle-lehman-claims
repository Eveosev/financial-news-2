UBS AG (UBS) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
agreed to pay $120 million to settle claims by investors in
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. securities in a lawsuit tied to
the investment bank’s 2008 collapse.  UBS was accused of violating federal securities laws in
underwriting and selling the securities to investors, who
claimed that offering materials contained misleading information
about Lehman Brothers’ financial condition.  “UBS is pleased to have resolved this legacy litigation
matter arising out of the 2008 financial crisis,” the Zurich-based lender said in a statement. “UBS agreed to the settlement
to avoid the cost and uncertainty of continued litigation.”  The settlement, disclosed yesterday in a filing in federal
court in New York, compares “favorably” with other recoveries
stemming from the credit crisis, the plaintiffs said. Lehman
Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008.  The settlement, which requires court approval, represents a
recovery of 13.4 percent of the total face value of securities
at issue, or about $896 million, without taking into account
UBS’s defenses and rights of offset, according to the court
filing.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Securities and Erisa
Litigation, 09-md-02017, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York ( Manhattan ).  With assistance from Erika Waddell in New York. Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
