Taiwan’s five-year bonds headed for
the biggest rally in a month as signs economic growth is losing
momentum prompted investors to favor the safest assets. The
local dollar strengthened.  Exports (TWTREXPY) , which account for more than 60 percent of gross
domestic product, rose 1.6 percent in July from a year earlier,
data showed Aug. 7. That was less than the 4.9 percent increase
forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey and compared with
an 8.6 percent advance the previous month. Consumer prices
advanced 0.08 percent, the least since August 2010.  The yield on the government’s 0.875 percent bonds due
January 2018 fell seven basis points this week to 1.10 percent
as of 10 a.m. in Taipei, the biggest drop since the five days
ended July 12, according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate
declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today.  “Taiwan’s July economic data was bad, which was a contrast
to its June numbers, showing its economic outlook isn’t certain
yet,” said Sandy Liao, a fixed-income trader at KGI Securities
Co. in Taipei. “Trading is quite thin today; We’re waiting for
the result of the two-year certificates sale.”  The central bank will sell NT$10 billion ($334 million) of
two-year negotiable certificates of deposit today, the first
such offering since 2003.  Currency Strengthens  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.7 percent from the end of last
week, and 0.1 percent today to NT$29.928 against its U.S.
counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The currency was 0.3
percent stronger 17 minutes before the 4 p.m. close yesterday,
and pared its gain to 0.2 percent.  The central bank has sold its currency in the run-up to the
close on most days since March 2012, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.3 percent to
NT$29.905 per dollar this week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 48 basis
points to 3.34 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.388 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
