The State of Texas this week filed a rather impolite response to the voting-rights concerns recently  expressed  by Attorney General Eric Holder. Last month, Holder announced that the Justice Department would deploy a little-used section of the Voting Rights Act to impose federal oversight on some jurisdictions that had been freed, courtesy of a 5-4 conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court, from having to "preclear" changes to voting rights (and redistricted election maps) with either a federal court or the Justice Department.  Texas is precisely the kind of jurisdiction the Justice Department had in mind. In 2011, Republicans in the state legislature produced redistricting maps that, according to the federal court, had been designed with “discriminatory purpose.” The result was a significant dilution of Hispanic voting power. In a  response  filed with a three-judge panel in San Antonio, State Attorney General (and Republican gubernatorial candidate) Greg Abbott more or less told the Justice Department what it could do with a Texas longhorn.  The most interesting part of the state's 46-page kiss-off, which I was alerted to by Rick Hasen's terrific election law  blog , is this passage: Wow. So the state defends itself from the charge that it has targeted minorities and tried to reduce their power by saying outright that it has instead targeted Democrats and tried to reduce  their  power.  That, of course, is what gerrymandering is all about, albeit usually not so brazenly. Democrats play the old game, too. But the state's response gets right to the nub of an  issue  unique to Republicans: Republicans are generally white, while their political opponents are white, black and brown. In a highly diverse state such as Texas, it's probably impossible for Republicans to target Democrats without targeting minorities. In fact, as they state in the court filing, they target Democrats  by  targeting minorities.  So, here's the question the federal courts must decide: When the white party uses its legislative authority to undermine the brown and black party, is that a racial act or merely a political one?
