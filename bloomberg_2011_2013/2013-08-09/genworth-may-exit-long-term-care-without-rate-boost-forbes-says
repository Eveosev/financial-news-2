Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  could stop
selling long-term-care coverage if it doesn’t win approval from
regulators for rate increases on existing policies, Forbes
reported.  Genworth could withdraw from the market if it can’t raise
the rates on 650,000 policies, Forbes reported, citing people it
didn’t identify.  Chief Executive Officer Tom McInerney has said the
Richmond, Virginia-based insurer is working to win as much as
$300 million in rate increases, Forbes reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
