Chicago gasoline strengthened after
 Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) ’s Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery had
a  power failure  that shut down multiple units.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in Chicago
gained 2.5 cents to 12 cents a gallon under  New York  Mercantile
Exchange gasoline futures at 12:40 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Marathon was restarting units at the
240,000 barrel-a-day plant today.  Gasoline sold in the Midcontinent, or Group 3 market, fell
1 cent a gallon to a discount of 6.5 cents against futures after
Koch Pipeline Co. said a pipeline that carries crude to two
Minneapolis-area refineries returned to service after shutting
Aug. 6.  “A lot of times when those pipelines go down, you spike
prices up and then when they come back online, you reverse the
other way,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “That’s because people are panic
buying and when they realize that things aren’t as bad, they
already have supply, and prices come back down even further.”  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped 75 cents to
$12.26 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
