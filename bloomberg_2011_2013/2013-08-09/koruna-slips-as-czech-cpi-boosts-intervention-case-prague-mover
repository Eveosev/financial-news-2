The Czech koruna snapped two days of
gains after inflation unexpectedly slowed, fueling speculation
the central bank will sell the currency.  The koruna depreciated 0.2 percent, the most among 31 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, to 25.883 per euro as of 11:44
a.m. in Prague. Yields on two-year government bonds fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.41 percent, a two-month low on a closing basis, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Consumer prices increased 1.4 percent in July from a year
earlier, the statistics office said, while analysts predicted
inflation would be unchanged at 1.6 percent, based on the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts. Several central
bank rate setters opposed a proposal to intervene against the
koruna in the market and chose to wait for potential further
signs of anti-inflationary trends, according to minutes from the
Czech National Bank’s meeting on Aug. 1 published today.  “Today’s data increase the probability of further
loosening of the monetary policy via koruna sales by the CNB,”
 Martin Lobotka , an economist at the Prague-based unit of Erste
Group Bank AG, wrote in a report to clients. “If inflation
falls down towards 1 percent, it will very likely cement the
decision.”  After three cuts of the main interest rate to 0.05 percent
last year, central bankers are debating whether the first koruna
interventions since 2002 are needed to battle the longest Czech
recession on record. Inflation is below the central bank’s
target of 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
