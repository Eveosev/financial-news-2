Thunderstorms and gusting winds are
delaying  air travel  throughout the U.S. Northeast, including New
York and  New Jersey .  Flights destined for New York’s John F. Kennedy
International and LaGuardia airports, as well as New Jersey’s
Newark Liberty and Boston, are halted for more than an hour,
according to the  Federal Aviation Administration ’s website. Some
traffic to Philadelphia is delayed by a half-hour.  “Low ceilings, winds and visibility have been a problem
all day, so all the big hubs in the Northeast have been
impacted,” said  Tim Morrin , a  National Weather Service 
meteorologist in Upton, New York.  The rain will continue through the rest of the day,
prompting flood warnings and advisories from eastern
 Pennsylvania  to Maine, the weather service said. The heaviest
rain is currently falling in New England. New York will probably
see more later today.  “As we head toward rush, showers most likely will
increase, but they don’t appear to be as heavy as what is
happening in  Massachusetts ,” Morrin said.  Some 290 flights around the U.S. were canceled, including
82 at LaGuardia and 72 at Newark, as of 4:15 p.m. New York time,
according to  FlightAware , a Houston-based airline tracking
service.  Morrin said the rain in New York will probably end around
midnight and tomorrow is expected to be sunny with highs about
86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius).  To contact the reporter on this story:
