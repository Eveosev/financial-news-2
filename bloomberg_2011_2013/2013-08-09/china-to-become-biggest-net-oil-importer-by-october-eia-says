China  will surpass the U.S. by
October to become the world’s biggest net oil importer on a
monthly basis, the Energy Information Administration said.  Imports by the second-biggest oil-consuming country will
reach 6.45 million barrels a day, surpassing the U.S.’s 6.23
million, the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
in this week’s Short-Term Energy Outlook. On a yearly basis,
China’s overseas purchases will surpass the U.S.’s next year.  “The imminent emergence of China as the world’s largest
net oil importer has been driven by steady growth in Chinese
demand, increased oil production in the  United States  and a flat
level of demand for oil in the U.S. market,” the agency said
today in a  report  on its website.  China will use 11 million barrels a day of oil in October,
the outlook showed. The U.S. will use 18.6 million.  Oil production, including crude and other liquids, will
rise to 12.4 million barrels a day in the U.S. by October.
China’s production will be 4.57 million.  Net Chinese imports will be 6.57 million barrels a day next
year, higher than the U.S.’s 5.71 million, EIA data showed.  U.S. oil production will rise by 28 percent between 2011
and 2014 to nearly 13 million barrels a day, primarily from
shale oil, tight oil and Gulf of Mexico deepwater fields, the
EIA said. China’s production will grow 6 percent over the period
to be a third of U.S. levels in 2014.  China’s liquid-fuels use will grow by 13 percent between
2011 and 2014 to more than 11 million barrels a day. U.S. demand
is forecast to stay around 18.7 million barrels during the
period, below the peak consumption level of 20.8 million in
2005, the EIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
