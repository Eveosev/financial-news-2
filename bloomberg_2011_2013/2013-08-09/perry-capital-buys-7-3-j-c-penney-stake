Perry Capital, the hedge-fund firm
founded by  Richard Perry , bought 7.3 percent of J.C. Penney Co.
and asked the board to appoint a new chairman and chief
executive officer, according to a letter sent to the company.  “We believe that immediately appointing Allen Questrom
chairman of the board and Ken Hicks CEO is imperative at this
juncture, and we anticipate that the company’s various
constituents would be highly supportive of such a change,”
Perry said the one-page letter sent to the board of the Plano,
Texas-based company today.  Perry’s request follows a letter by  Bill Ackman , J.C.
Penny’s biggest shareholder, calling for a speedier process to
replace CEO Mike Ullman. Ackman said today that former J.C.
Penney CEO Questrom may be willing to rejoin the company as
chairman even before a new top executive is chosen.  The retailer’s shares fell 5.6 percent to $12.90 at 2:33
p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
