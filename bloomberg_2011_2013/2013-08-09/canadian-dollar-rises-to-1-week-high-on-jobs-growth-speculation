The Canadian dollar rose to its
highest level in a week on bets a report on July jobs growth
will add to signs the country’s economy is on track to beat  Bank
of Canada  growth projections for the year.  The currency rose against the majority of its most-traded
peers before a report forecast to show Canada’s economy created
10,000 jobs in July after losing 400 the month before, according
to the median estimate of a Bloomberg survey of 23 economists.
The Bank of Canada raised its estimate for growth in gross
domestic product to 1.8 percent for 2013 at its July 17 policy
meeting, up from a prediction of 1.5 percent in April.  “There’s this expectation that we do see some slightly
better employment numbers in Canada, which are consistent with
growth a little faster than certainly the Bank of Canada is
considering,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, by phone from London. “It’s
consistent with an economy that’s generally following the lead
of the U.S.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.3 percent to
C$1.0302 per  U.S. dollar  at 7:59 a.m. in Toronto, touching the
highest level since Aug 1. One loonie buys 97.07 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
