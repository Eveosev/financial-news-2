Canadian  stocks  fell after employment
unexpectedly decreased in July and corporate profits trailed
analysts’ estimates.  Dorel Industries Inc. (DII/B)  plunged 15 percent after reporting
earnings short of projections and announcing plans to cut its
workforce. Black Diamond Group Ltd. lost 4.6 percent as the
company posted lower-than-estimated profit.  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  rose
4.1 percent after Reuters reported that the smartphone maker was
considering going private. Magna International Inc. climbed 2.5
percent after reporting record sales in its second quarter.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 14.88
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,538.04 at 9:49 a.m. in Toronto.
The index has fallen 0.4 percent this week, headed for the
biggest loss since June 21.  Employment fell by 39,400 last month, while the jobless
rate rose to 7.2 percent from 7.1 percent,  Statistics Canada 
said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected a 10,000 job gain and an unchanged jobless rate,
according to the median forecasts in surveys with 23 responses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
