OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes SA,
Brazil’s worst-performing stock this year, slid as much as 10
percent after it said damaged pumps curbed output by 40 percent
in July.  OGX, as the Rio de Janeiro-based explorer controlled by
entrepreneur  Eike Batista  is known, fell 6.8 percent to 55
centavos at 10:50 a.m. in  Sao Paulo , the biggest decliner on
Brazil’s main index. The stock is down 87 percent this year.  Production at the Tubarao Azul offshore field plummeted to
900 barrels a day in July from 9,700 in June after it shut both
of its producing wells, OGX said in a statement yesterday. The
company has had problems with the subsea pumps at all three
wells at the field this year and has said it may abandon the
deposit in 2014 if production isn’t economically viable.  The company is pinning its hopes on the Tubarao Martelo
field, also located offshore in the Campos Basin, where it plans
to start production before the end of this year to help finance
investments and make interest payments on its debt. The company
is overhauling its business plan after encountering geology in
Campos that impedes the flow of oil and drove the company to
abandon some projects it had previously declared commercial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
