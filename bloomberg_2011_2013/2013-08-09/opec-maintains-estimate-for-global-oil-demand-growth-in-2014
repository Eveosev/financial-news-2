The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries kept estimates for global oil demand growth
in 2014 unchanged amid a stable outlook for the world economy.  World oil consumption will increase by 1 million barrels a
day, or 1.2 percent, next year to about 90.8 million a day, the
group’s Vienna-based secretariat said in its monthly market
report today. Increasing output from countries  outside OPEC 
means demand for the organization’s crude will slide to 29.7
million barrels a day, or about 600,000 a day less than its 12
members pumped last month, the report showed.  Brent crude futures have gained about 2.8 percent in the
past three months, trading near $107 a barrel in  London  today,
amid signs the slowdown in China’s expansion has stabilized,
U.S.  unemployment  retreating and the recession in European
economies is easing. OPEC agreed to tighten compliance with its
official production target of 30 million barrels a day at its
last meeting in May. The group will next meet on Dec. 4.  OPEC said group production fell 97,000 barrels a day to
30.3 million last month amid declines in Libya and Iraq, citing
an average of secondary sources for the estimates. Output in the
North African nation slumped 124,400 barrels a day to about 1.1
million while Iraq’s production slid by 50,900 a day to 2.97
million a day.  Non-OPEC  The organization increased its 2014 forecast for oil supply
from other nations by 20,000 barrels a day. Non-OPEC producers,
led by the U.S. and  Canada , will bolster production by 1.15
million barrels a day in 2014 to 55.1 million a day, according
to the report.  OPEC’s projection for global oil demand growth is similar
to that of the  International Energy Agency , the Paris-based
adviser to oil-consuming nations, which earlier today forecast
that consumption will increase 1.1 million barrels a day in 2014
to 92 million a day.  The group’s members are  Algeria ,  Angola ,  Ecuador , Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United
Arab Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
