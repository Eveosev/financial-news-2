Russia analyst Dimitri Simes said in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital With
 Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that President  Barack Obama  is
“quite likely” to meet one-on-one with Russian President
 Vladimir Putin  next month even though the U.S. canceled plans
for a Moscow summit meeting.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the program with the president and CEO of
the Center for the National Interest, Russian expert Dimitri
Simes. Thank you for being with us.  DIMITRI SIMES, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CENTER FOR THE NATIONAL
INTEREST: My pleasure.  HUNT: With the deterioration of U.S.-Russian relations and
the repressive crackdowns in Moscow, are we back to the worst
days of the Cold War?  SIMES: I don’t think so. I don’t see much evidence of that.
Of course, there is a lot of polemics on both sides, but nobody
is talking about shooting at each other. Russian and American
officials are still talking. And the president, of course, he’s
still going to Russia in September for the G-20. The White House
said that they have no plans at this point for the president to
meet with Putin, but let’s face it. When they will be in the
same room for two days, it would be kind of interesting if they
would not talk to each other.  HUNT: So you think a meeting between the two in  St.
Petersburg , despite what they say now, is probable?  SIMES: It is probable. It is not pre-arranged, but it seems
quite likely.  HUNT: Was the cancellation of the Moscow one-on-one a
deliberate and a high-level snub on both parts?  SIMES: I think that there was an understanding on both
parts that there was not much progress on substantive issues.
There was also understanding on both sides that President Obama
did not quite want to go to Moscow after the Snowden affair
because he would be subjected to very serious domestic
criticism. And Putin did not particularly want for Obama to come
to Moscow because he would have what they hope -- the Russians
hope -- is going to be a very successful G-20 summit. It will be
a high point. And then Obama would come to Moscow. He would feel
obliged to go and see Russian dissidents. So for Putin, it would
be anticlimax.  HUNT: Well let me ask you, what was Putin thinking on
Snowden? He doesn’t want to keep this guy. So what was his game
here?  SIMES: Well actually I don’t think he had a game. I think
he felt that the Obama administration was playing a game.
Putin’s view was very simple. They did not invite Snowden to
come to  Russia . He came to Russia from  Hong Kong  with the
assumption that he would follow to  Havana . The Russians did not
know when he boarded the Russian plane in Hong Kong that his
passport was canceled. They actually had learned about that only
when the flight was already in the air. Then the Cubans are
saying, we don’t need additional complications with the United
States. We would not allow him to pass through Havana.  So the Russians found Snowden in Moscow. The United States
blocked Snowden’s travel anywhere else. So the Russians had a
chance to return him to the United States or to do what they
have done. They have no extradition treaty with the  United
States . They have offered such a treaty several times. No
American administration will be prepared to negotiate it. And
Russia is not a friend. It’s not a partner of the United States.
So for Putin to return Snowden, that would not be understood by
anybody in Russia.  HUNT: Let me go back to the Putin-Obama relations. There’s
a personal matter. There are reports that these two men really
dislike each other.  SIMES: I think that there is no love lost. As you may
remember, when Putin left office, left Russian presidency,
became prime minister, it was 2009. Obama went to Moscow, and
before he came to Moscow by praising Medvedev publicly and
criticizing Putin, saying that Putin’s one leg was in the  Cold
War .  Now taking into account that Putin even as prime minister
was still a dominant presence in Russian politics, that was not
very smart on Obama’s part. It was a poor beginning. Medvedev
was much more prepared to listen to Obama and to kind of
accommodate the American president. Putin is a very different
kind of a guy. Much more cynical, much tougher, with a much
greater sense of self-confidence. And I think that Obama and
Putin genuinely have rather poor chemistry.  HUNT: Let me ask you about some things the United States
should or should not do. Are there actions they should be
taking? Some members of Congress are saying we ought to pull out
of the 2014 Olympics, which is a source of great pride to Putin.
Would that be a smart or a dumb move?  SIMES: Well first of all, that of course would really be
damaging to Putin because this is his personal project. And I’m
sure he would take it personally, and it would undercut somewhat
his legitimacy at home, particularly if the United States is
joined by other Western nations. I also have to say, however,
that most nations, including most major nations, I’m sure will
still take part in the Olympics. And while Putin would be
snubbed, I think that the United States as a result may be
isolated. It’s not just a question of American (inaudible) being
deeply disappointed. It’s a question of risking a demonstration
that the United States is no longer such a hegemonic power that
when we say we don’t go, the whole world follows.  HUNT: So a bad idea.  SIMES: I think it’s a bad idea.  HUNT: What - what would you advise this administration to
do now to try to reset our relations with Russia?  SIMES: To do two things which probably are not natural to
them. To be more realistic and to be tougher at the same time.
By being more realistic, I mean stop lecturing the Russians.
Stop telling them about their imperfections. Stop trying to
provide them unrequired (ph) guidance on the human rights.
Tougher. If we tell that something is very important to the
United States, and we have to be careful in deciding what it is,
but once we have told them that this is a red line, if they
disregard it, I think that there should be a higher price to
pay. Because at this juncture what we see in Moscow is that
Putin almost has a contempt for Obama. He considers him
pretentious but weak. It’s a very bad situation for a superpower
to be in.  HUNT: Let me circle back to our first question. You
mentioned superpower a minute ago. One difference it would seem
from the Cold War era is the question of whether (Russia) really
is a superpower anymore like the United States and like  China .
Militarily, economically, politically, Russia can certainly
cause problems. They can impede, but they really aren’t a
superpower, are they?  SIMES: No, they are not a superpower. They’re a major
regional power. But first of all, they do have a seat at the UN
Security Council. And it is the UN Security Council that
provides legitimacy to all kinds of foreign operations,
interventions, (inaudible) and et cetera. If you want to deal
with  Iran  and to have international legitimacy, Russia is
important.  Russia also has a huge nuclear arsenal which still is
perfectly capable of destroying the United States. And I don’t
think that unless something terribly important is involved in
terms of American interests you want to have a relationship with
Russia when you have to ask yourself is a nuclear confrontation
possible.  Last but not least, I think that basically we can ignore
Russia, but only if we have a very good relationship with China.
But if we would try simultaneously to pressure China and Russia,
we’re running the risk that China and Russia would become closer
together at the American expense. One country that has applauded
the Russian treatment of Snowden was China. Just yesterday
Chinese newspaper Global Post said that Putin really acted as a
serious leader, and this was not only (inaudible) for Russia but
a kind of -- a model for the Chinese how they should handle
themselves vis-a-vis the United States.  HUNT: Okay. Dimitri Simes, it’ll be a fascinating month to
watch. Thank you so much for being with us.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
