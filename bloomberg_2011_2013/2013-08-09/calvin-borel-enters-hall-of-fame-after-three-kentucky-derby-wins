Jockey Calvin Borel, who won a record
three  Kentucky  Derby races in four years, will be inducted today
into the National Museum of Racing’s Hall of Fame.  Borel, 46, has won more than 5,000 races with purse
earnings in excess of $122 million in a career that began in
1983. He won the Derby aboard Street Sense in 2007, 50-1
longshot Mine That Bird in 2009 and Super Saver in 2010.  He also rode 2009 Horse of the Year Rachel Alexandra to
victories in the Preakness, Woodward, Haskell, Mother Goose and
Kentucky Oaks. Borel and Hall of Famer Pat Day are the only
jockeys with more than 1,000 wins at  Churchill Downs (CHDN) , the home
of the Derby in Louisville, Kentucky.  August Belmont II and Paul Mellon also will be inducted
posthumously along with thoroughbreds Housebuster, Invasor,
Lure, McDynamo and Tuscalee at today’s ceremony in Saratoga
Springs, New York.  Belmont, a New York banker who bred more than 100 stakes
winners, opened Belmont Park in 1905, the site of the third leg
of thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown. He sold his yearling crop
in 1917 to serve in Spain during World War I at the age of 65.  Mellon, whose grandfather founded Mellon Bank, began racing
under Rokeby Stables in 1948. His horses won more than 1,000
stakes races with total earnings in excess of $30 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
