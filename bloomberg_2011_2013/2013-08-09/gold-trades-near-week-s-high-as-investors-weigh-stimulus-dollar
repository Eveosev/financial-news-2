Gold rose for the third straight day
on speculation that the demand will increase amid signs of a
pickup in the economy in  China , the world’s second-biggest
consumer of the metal. Silver advanced to a two-week high.  In July, China’s industrial output rose more than estimated
by analysts from a year earlier, government data showed today.
Yesterday, statistics indicated a rebound in trade. The Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials  climbed as much as
1.1 percent, snapping a five-session slump. Zinc and nickel
paced the rally, while platinum jumped to an eight-week high.  “There is optimism about higher demand from China as the
economy improves,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The bullish mood in the industrial-metal complex is
helping gold and silver.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,312.20 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The metal gained 2.1 percent in the previous two days.  Trading was 49 percent below the average in the past 100
days for this time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold has fallen 22 percent this year as some investors lost
faith the metal as a store of value amid an equity rally and low
inflation and concern that the  Federal Reserve  may slow the pace
of monetary stimulus.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 1.1 percent to
$20.407 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price reached
$20.53, the highest since July 23.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed 0.6 percent to $1,500.60 an ounce.
