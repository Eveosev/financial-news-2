Arsenal was drawn to play Fenerbahce
in the  Champions League  soccer playoffs, while AC Milan plays
 PSV Eindhoven  in a meeting of former European champions.  The matchups were among 10 determined by today’s draw in
Nyon, Switzerland. The winners of the two-match series advance
to the 32-team group stage of Europe’s elite club competition.  Turkish club Fenerbahce’s participation in the Champions
League is subject to a ruling from the Court of Arbitration
(CAS) over a ban imposed by European soccer governing body UEFA
for alleged match-fixing. CAS is expected to rule after the
start of the playoff round on Aug. 20.  Seven-time champion AC Milan will take on 1988 winner PSV,
and Schalke was drawn against Metalist Kharkiv of Ukraine, which
faces a UEFA hearing next week over match-fixing allegations.  The Champions League playoffs open Aug. 20 and 21, with the
return matches on Aug. 27 and 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
