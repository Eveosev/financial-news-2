A Bangladeshi man who tried to
detonate what he thought was a bomb at the New York Federal
Reserve was sentenced to 30 years in prison.  Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, 22, was sentenced in
federal court in  Brooklyn , New York, by U.S. District Judge
Carol Bagley Amon for attempting to use a weapon of mass
destruction. Nafis, who was arrested in October after trying to
set off 1,000 pounds of fake explosives, pleaded guilty to the
charge in February.  “I am persuaded that the defendant was a serious threat to
the safety of  New Yorkers , of Americans,” Amon said.  While covering his face, wearing sunglasses and disguising
his voice, Nafis had a federal agent who was posing as a co-conspirator record a video statement before the bombing attempt
in which he said, “We will not stop until we attain victory or
martyrdom,” according to a criminal complaint filed in the
case.  Prosecutors alleged Nafis came to  New York  on a student
visa and wanted to engage in a suicide bombing or other violent
attacks. He reached out to people in his planning efforts who
turned out to be federal informants and agents who supplied him
with inert materials and helped him try to carry out his plot,
according to the complaint.  The case is U.S. v. Nafis, 1:12-cr-00720, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
