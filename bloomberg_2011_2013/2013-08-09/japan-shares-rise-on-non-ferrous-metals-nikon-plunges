Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index heading for its first increase in three days, as non-ferrous metal producers led gains among the gauge’s 33 industry
groups. Nikon Corp. tumbled.  Nikon tumbled 9.5 percent after cutting its profit forecast
on weak camera demand, prompting UBS AG and Jefferies Group LLC
to downgrade the stock. Dowa Holdings Co. led an advance by zinc
and aluminum producers. Mitsubishi Paper Mills Ltd. surged 9.9
percent ahead of reporting earnings today.  The Topix climbed 1 percent to 1,150.63 as of 9:26 a.m. in
 Tokyo , with about four shares rising for each that fell. The
gauge is on course for a 3.8 percent decline this week. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1 percent to 13,734.73.  Even after falling for the past three months, the Topix was
still up 33 percent this year as of yesterday, leading gains
among developed markets tracked by Bloomberg, amid optimism that
record  Bank of Japan  stimulus and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
reforms will boost growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
