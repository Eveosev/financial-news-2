(Corrects percentage point decline in fourth paragraph.)  Moody’s Investors Service lowered its
forecast for the global speculative-grade default rate to 3
percent for 2013 from last month’s projection of 3.1 percent.  “Corporate default rates have been holding steady at
historically low rates, ranging between 2 percent and 3 percent
for most of the past two and a half years,” Albert Metz,
managing director of credit policy research at Moody’s in  New
York , said today in a statement.  Borrowing costs for junk-rated companies are falling after
rising for two months on concern the  Federal Reserve  may reduce
stimulus measures if the  U.S. economy  shows sustained
improvement. High-yield bonds  returned  0.2 percent this week,
bringing the six-week gain to 2.1 percent after the securities
lost 2.3 percent in June, according to Bloomberg bond index
data.  Moody’s trailing 12-month speculative grade corporate
default rate reached 2.9 percent in July, up 0.1 percentage
point from a month earlier. Four debt issuers defaulted in July,
bringing the total this year to 43.  Standard & Poor’s  increased its rate to 2.4 percent in
June, up from 2.3 percent in May in a report today that gave no
year-end estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
