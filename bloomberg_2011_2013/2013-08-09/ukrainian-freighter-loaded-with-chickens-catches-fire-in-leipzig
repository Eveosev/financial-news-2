An Antonov cargo plane was destroyed
in a blaze on the ground of  Germany ’s Leipzig-Halle airport,
temporarily disrupting operations at the country’s second-largest cargo hub.  German aviation safety officials and police are probing the
cause of the incident, the airport said on its website. The
freighter, which caught fire while in a parking position, was
owned by a Ukrainian operator, Uwe Schuhart, spokesman for
Mitteldeutsche Airport Holding, said by phone, declining to name
the carrier as the investigation continues.  Personnel on the Soviet-era An-12 plane, which was loaded
with live chickens, escaped uninjured, the spokesman said.
Antonov developed the four-engine turbo-propeller aircraft in
the 1950s and production ceased 40 years ago.  Regular operations at Leipzig, located about two hours
south of Berlin, resumed at 3 a.m. About 60 crew and 15
emergency vehicles were involved in extinguishing the fire, the
airport said. The cargo hub was closed for 52 minutes.  Leipzig-Halle handled 863,665 tons of freight last year and
about 2.3 million passengers, it said. The company also owns the
Dresden airport in east Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
