Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the
world’s largest, said it lost 2 percent on its government bond
holdings in the second quarter as the value of its Japanese
securities and inflation-linked debt declined.  “The rise in yields meant that most fixed-income sectors
produced a negative return for the quarter,” the fund said in a
 statement  today. “Uncertainty in fixed-income markets also
increased.”  The $760 billion Government Pension Fund Global said its
Treasuries lost 1 percent in the period, while Japan’s
 government bonds  slumped 5.9 percent. Inflation-linked
securities dropped 3.4 percent, while euro-denominated debt
returned 1.6 percent, it said.  The wealth fund said government bonds made up 60.9 percent
of its fixed-income investments at the end of the quarter.  “The fund increased its investments in government bonds
from Japan, the U.S. and Brazil in the quarter,” the Oslo-based
investor said in its statement. It “reduced its holdings of
government debt from  France , the U.K. and  Australia ,” it said.  The wealth fund also invested in securities issued by the
European Financial Stability Facility, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
