BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , Latin America’s
biggest exchange operator, is considering changes to its
Ibovespa stock gauge as the sell-off in  Eike Batista ’s companies
wreaks havoc with  Brazil ’s benchmark index.  BM&FBovespa will announce any changes to the number of
stocks on the index or their weighting by the end of September,
Chief Executive Officer Edemir Pinto told reporters today in Sao
Paulo. A committee of exchange executives and bank and
brokerage-firm officials delivered a report last month
suggesting changes to the methodology.  “The Ibovespa is 45 years old, and the number of companies
on the market has increased so much over the years,” Pinto
said. “The index should reflect the diversity of sectors of the
Brazilian economy that are present on the exchange now.”  Shares of Batista oil producer  OGX Petroleo e Gas
Participacoes SA  have tumbled 87 percent this year amid output
shortfalls and dwindling cash, roiling the Ibovespa gauge. The
company’s  weighting  on the index will increase to 4.4 percent in
September from the current 2.1 percent, according to an Aug. 1
preview of changes that are scheduled to take effect under the
existing methodology.  Batista, who was the world’s eighth-richest person last
year, has fallen out of the ranks of billionaires as his
companies’ shares slumped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
