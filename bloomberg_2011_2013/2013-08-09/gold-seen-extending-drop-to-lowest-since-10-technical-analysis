Gold may extend its decline to the
lowest level since August 2010 as the rally from a double bottom
ends, according to Forex Capital Trading Pty.  “We struck a major low back at around $1,180 an ounce and
then formed a double-bottom,” the Melbourne-based head of
research Steven Dooley said by phone today. “It bounced higher
and it now looks like the upwards movement is a bit exhausted at
around $1,347. We think we’re swinging back lower and targeting
around the $1,180 level or even lower.”  Gold slumped 22 percent this year on speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve will pare bond purchases that have bolstered the
economy.  Charles Evans ,  Sandra Pianalto  and  Richard Fisher ,
regional Fed presidents in Chicago, Cleveland and  Dallas , said
this week the central bank may be closer to tapering bond buying
as the jobs market recovers.  “The gold price is still well below the 200-day moving
average and very much driving lower,” said Dooley. “There
doesn’t seem to be any signs of any likelihood of reversal in
the gold price at the moment.”  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$1,309.12 an ounce by 2:02 p.m. in Singapore.  Prices fell to $1,180.50 on June 28, the lowest level since
August 2010, and rallied to $1,267.68 on July 2 before sliding
to $1,208.58 on July 5. The double bottom was confirmed when
prices climbed above $1,267 again, according to Dooley.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
