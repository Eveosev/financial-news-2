Rachel Lord, head of corporate equity
derivatives at  Citigroup Inc. (C) , left to join  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , one
of the U.S. bank’s biggest clients.  Lord, who joined Citigroup in 2009 after more than a decade
at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , will run the European arm of iShares,
BlackRock’s exchange-traded funds division, the New York-based
money manager said in a memo to employees today. She replaces
Joe Linhares, who will return to the U.S. at the year-end.  “Our primary challenge in Europe is growing the pie --
expanding the ways clients use ETFs,” David Blumer, head of
BlackRock in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares, said in the memo. “Rachel
brings together a number of capabilities we believe are
essential for this next era of iShares.”  ETFs give investors exposure to baskets of stocks, bonds
and other securities, and can be used to mirror indexes like the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Unlike mutual funds, they are
traded throughout the day like stocks. Investors poured $81.6
billion into U.S. and international stock ETFs in the first
seven months of this year, according to  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  in
Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
