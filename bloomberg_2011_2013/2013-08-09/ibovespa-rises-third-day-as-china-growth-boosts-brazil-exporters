The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  rose for a third day as
a report showing Chinese industrial output expanded faster than
forecast boosted the outlook for Brazil’s top trading partner.  Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, contributed
the most to the benchmark index’s advance. Steelmaker Gerdau SA
rallied to a three-month high.  Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais ,
Brazil’s second-biggest power utility, fell after saying it will
pay 1.4 billion reais for a stake in Renova Energia SA.  The Ibovespa rose 0.1 percent to 48,995.16 at 10:31 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo . The real climbed 0.3 percent to 2.2783 per dollar.
The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index rose 1.6
percent.  China ’s factory production increased 9.7 percent in
July from a year ago, government data showed today, compared
with the 8.9 percent median estimate among economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  “The outlook for global growth, especially for  emerging
markets , is improving,” said Rogerio Freitas, a partner at
hedge fund Teorica Investimentos in Rio de Janeiro. “The China
fears had been scaring investors off emerging economies, and
we’re seeing some of that fear begin to fade.”  The Ibovespa surged 3.1 percent yesterday, leading gains
among 94 major equity benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg after data
showed imports increased more than forecast in China. The gauge
is up 1 percent this week.  Vale gained 0.6 percent to 30.11 reais today. Gerdau rose
1.1 percent to 15.45 reais. Cemig, as Cia. Energetica is also
known, dropped 1.4 percent to 20.33 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
