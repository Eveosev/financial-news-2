General Motors Co. (GM)  will cease selling
its Opel brand vehicles in Australia after 11 months as the
venture on the continent proved to be unprofitable.  “The framework conditions in Australia have deteriorated
drastically,” said Johan Willems, Opel’s board member for
communications, in an e-mailed statement. “It’s not financially
feasible to continue exporting vehicles under the Opel brand.”  Opel started selling vehicles in Australia in September
2012 and delivered 1,530 cars through the end of June. The
vehicles were more expensive than those of GM’s local Holden
brand. Opel is now abolishing its dealer network in Australia,
Ulrich Weber, a spokesman for the manufacturer based in
Ruesselsheim,  Germany  said in the e-mail.  Opel, with restricted access to the booming Chinese market,
is combating a 20-year low in auto-sales in the euro-region
where recession is hurting consumer demand. First-half
registrations at Opel and its U.K. sister brand Vauxhall fell
6.8 percent to 436,493 vehicles, according to figures from the
Brussels-based ACEA industry group.  Pressure in the Australian market is increasing as a surge
in the country’s currency undermines the local industry’s
ability to compete with imports. Holden said in June it plans to
cut about 400 jobs as it seeks to reduce labor costs in the
country to make local production viable. In May, Ford Motor Co.
said it had decided to stop making cars in  Australia  after nine
decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
