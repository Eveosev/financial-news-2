Dendreon Corp. (DNDN) , maker of the prostate
cancer treatment Provenge, plunged the most in 21 months after
saying sales of the drug won’t increase this year as forecast.  Dendreon declined 26 percent to $3.39 at the close in New
York, the biggest single-day drop since Nov. 3, 2011. The shares
of the Seattle-based company had decreased 13 percent this year
through yesterday.  Provenge, Dendreon’s only marketed product, generated more
than 99 percent of the company’s $73.3 million in second-quarter
revenue, which fell short of analysts’ estimates of $74.8
million. Based on enrollments in July and early August, Provenge
won’t be able to generate enough sales in the second half of
2013 to overcome the first six months, the company said
yesterday on a conference call.  “We’ll not be able to meet our goal of growing Provenge
year-over-year,” Chief Executive Officer John Johnson said on
the call. “We have seen that when Provenge is recommended to
patients by physicians, some patients may hesitate because they
do not understand immunotherapy.”  Separately, the company said Chief Financial Officer
Gregory T. Schiffman will be leaving effective Dec. 31. Finance
Vice President Gregory R. Cox will assume the role of interim
CFO starting today.  Provenge was approved in 2010 as the first therapy in the
U.S. that trains the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells
as if they were a virus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
