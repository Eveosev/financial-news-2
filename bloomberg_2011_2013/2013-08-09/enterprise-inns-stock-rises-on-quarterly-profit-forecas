By Colm Heatley  Aug. 9 (Bloomberg --  Enterprise Inns Plc (ETI) , the second-biggest U.K. pub chain, rose to the highest price in almost four
years after Numis Securities said the company’s fourth-quarter
profit-growth forecast exceeded the broker’s estimate.  The stock gained as much as 7.4 percent to 159 pence, the
highest intraday price since September 2009, and was trading up
3.5 percent at 12:13 p.m. in  London . Volume was more than double
three-month daily average. The stock has gained 49 percent this
year, valuing the company at 775 million pounds ($1.2 billion).  Enterprise predicts an increase in net income, excluding
acquisitions and disposals, in the three months through
September as business “continues to improve” and it upgrades
pubs to attract customers, the Solihull, England-based company
said in a statement yesterday. That compares with “a flat
outcome” predicted by Numis.  “There is slight upside to forecasts if Enterprise Inns
returns to positive like-for-like net-income growth,” Douglas Jack, an analyst at Numis with an add  recommendation  on
Enterprise Inns stock, said in a research report, in which he
increased his share-price estimate to 160 pence from 145 pence.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank AG, Oriel Securities and Barclays Plc
also reiterated buy recommendations yesterday.  Like-for-like net income for the 18 weeks to August 3 fell
2.7 percent, with the decline slowing from a 4.2 percent drop in
the first half, Enterprise Inns said yesterday.
