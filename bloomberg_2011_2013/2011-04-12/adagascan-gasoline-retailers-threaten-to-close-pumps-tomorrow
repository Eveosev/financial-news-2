Madagascarâ€™s gasoline retailers may
close gas stations tomorrow unless they can agree on a new price
with the government that protects their profit margins, an oil
ministry official said.  The ministry will meet with industry representatives today
to try and resolve the dispute, said Mahefa Rakotomalala, a
spokesman for the Oil and Mining Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
