Wayne Bennett, a seven-time
premiership-winning coach in Australian rugby league, was hired
as head coach of the Newcastle Knights on a four-year contract.  Bennett, who had also been linked with South Sydney and a
return to the Brisbane Broncos, will start on Nov. 1, the
Knights said today on their  website . His contract with the St.
George-Illawarra Dragons expires at the end of the 2011 National
Rugby League season.  Bennett, who guided the Broncos to six titles during a 20-
year tenure and also coached the Dragons to last season’s
championship, said his decision was founded on the vision of the
Knights’ new owner, coal-mine proprietor Nathan Tinkler.  “I sat down with Nathan and was struck by his passion and
knowledge of rugby league,” Bennett, 61, said in a statement
issued by the Tinkler Sports Group. “Private ownership appeals
to me. I like it. This guy wants to take Newcastle to another
level.”  The Tinkler Sports Group  secured ownership  of the Knights,
who won the last of their two titles in 2001, on March 31 after
97 percent of the club’s members voted in favor of his offer,
which guarantees annual sponsorship revenue of A$10 million
($10.4 million) over the next 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
