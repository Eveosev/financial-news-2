Colony Capital LLC plans to hire an
advisor to sell the Paris Saint-Germain soccer team, Le Parisien
reported, citing people close to the firm.  Sebastien Bazin, who runs Colonyâ€™s European operations, had
been seeking a minority investor in the club, the newspaper
reported. He now wants a buyer to acquire the whole club, the
newspaper reported.  PSG is worth 50 million euros to 60 million euros, Le
Parisien reported. A buyer may acquire 30 percent to 50 percent
initially, and take full control over time, the newspaper said.  Bazin declined to comment when contacted by phone, Le
Parisien said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
