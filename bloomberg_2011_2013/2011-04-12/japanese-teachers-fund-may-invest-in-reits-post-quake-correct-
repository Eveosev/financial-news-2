(Corrects amount  Bank of Japan  said it would purchase in the
fourth paragraph.)  Japan’s  Teachers’ Mutual Aid Co-
operative Society , which manages 650 billion yen ($7.8 billion),
may invest in real estate investment trusts to hedge against
inflation that may be spurred by  government spending  after the
March 11 earthquake.  Teachers’ Mutual will consider investing in Japanese REITs
in the fiscal year starting April 1, said Toru Higuchi, a
general manager in the asset management department. REITs are
attractive because they are more transparent and liquid than
other property investments and offer rental income and
protection against inflation, he said.  “Massive spending for reconstruction work is likely,”
said Higuchi. “We need to manage assets so that we can prepare
for yields that may go up because of fears about a worsening
fiscal situation.”  The 35-member Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index has risen 14
percent, recouping losses following the March 11 temblor, after
the Bank of  Japan  said it would double J-REIT purchases to 100
billion yen. The index had a dividend yield of 5.03 percent as
of March 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There is a 20 percent to 30 percent chance that the
benchmark 10-year government bond yield may exceed 2 percent
this year, according to Higuchi, who spoke in an interview in
Tokyo on March 30.  Ten-year yields slid to a two-month low on an intraday
basis of 1.145 percent on March 15 as investors sought the
safety of government debt after the earthquake. Since then,
yields have held at about 1.2 percent, rising to 1.245 percent
on March 30.  Teachers’ Mutual, which had 535,234 members as of the year
ended March 2010, earned returns on assets of 0.32 percent in
those 12 months and had a loss of 0.56 percent in value the
previous year, according to a  statement  on its website. The
organization offers coverage for teachers including medical,
automobile and fire insurance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
