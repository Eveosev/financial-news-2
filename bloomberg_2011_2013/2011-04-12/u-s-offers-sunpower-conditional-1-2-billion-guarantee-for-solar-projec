SunPower Corp. (SPWRA) , a California solar
panel maker and project developer, received conditional
commitment for a $1.2 billion U.S. Department of Energy loan
guarantee for a 250-megawatt plant in southern California.  Construction on the California Valley Solar Ranch plant is
expected to begin in the second half of the year, contingent on
permitting and financing, San Jose, California-based SunPower
said today in a statement.  The project will use  solar panels  made by SunPower. It is
expected to begin generating electricity in late 2011 and to
reach full capacity in 2013.  NRG Solar, a unit of the independent power producer  NRG
Energy Inc. (NRG) , will finance and own the project.  SunPower lost 12 cents, or less than 1 percent, to close
today at $16.27 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Californiaâ€™s largest utility,
will buy the power from the project.  The Energy Department said it has offered  loan guarantees ,
or conditional commitments for loan guarantees, totaling more
than $19 billion to support 21 clean energy projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
