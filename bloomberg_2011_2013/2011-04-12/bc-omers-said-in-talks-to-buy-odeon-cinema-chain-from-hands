BC Partners  Ltd. and Omers Private
Equity Inc. entered exclusive talks to buy the Odeon and UCI
cinema chain from Guy Hands’s Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.,
said two people with knowledge of the talks.  A purchase by the U.K. and Canadian funds may value the
company at as much as 1.2 billion pounds ($1.95 billion), said
one of the people, who declined to be identified because the
talks are private. Terra Firma may also decide to refinance the
business instead of selling it, one person said.  BC Partners, the London-based buyout fund manager, and
Omers, the buyout arm of the Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System, approached Terra Firma about buying Odeon and
UCI after failing to acquire Vue Entertainment Ltd., the U.K.’s
third-largest cinema operator. Vue was purchased by rival
private-equity firm Doughty Hanson & Co. in November.  Terra Firma, which in February had to cede control of EMI
Group Ltd. to  Citigroup Inc. (C) , bought and merged Odeon and UCI in
2004 in a 650 million-euro ($939.5 million) deal, according to
Terra Firma’s website.  Officials at BC Partners and Terra Firma declined to
comment. An official at Omers couldn’t be immediately reached.  The talks between Terra Firma, BC and Omers were reported
earlier today by the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
