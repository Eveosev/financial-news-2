Treasuries rose for the first time
in three days as investors sought safety amid declining stocks
and commodities after  Japan ’s nuclear crisis worsened, boosting
demand at a U.S. auction of $32 billion of three-year notes.  The notes drew a yield of 1.280 percent, compared with the
average forecast of 1.293 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
9 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers. Inflation
expectations slipped from a three-year high, while Fed Bank of
New York President William C. Dudley said the  U.S. economy  isn’t
strong enough for stimulus to be removed.  “There has been a move back into Treasuries as risk assets
are off,” said  John Briggs , a U.S. government bond strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , one of 20 primary dealers that that are
obligated to bid in  U.S. debt  offerings. “The auction was
strong, with demand for front end debt still stable.”  The yield on the current three-year note fell 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 1.22 percent at 5 p.m. in
New York, according to Bloomberg Data. It was the lowest level
since April 5. The price of the 1.25 percent security maturing
in March 2014 increased 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face amount,
to 100 3/32.  The benchmark 10-year note yield tumbled as much as 11
basis points, the biggest intraday drop since March 16, to 3.47
percent before trading at 3.49 percent, down nine basis points.  Oil, Stocks Fall  Crude oil for May delivery dropped the most on an intraday
basis in almost a month, falling as much as 4.1 percent to
$105.47 a barrel in  New York . It touched $113.46 yesterday, the
highest since September 2008. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
fell 0.8 percent.  Ten-year yields climbed 44 basis points through yesterday’s
closing since touching a three-month low of 3.14 percent on
March 17, the week after the worst earthquake in Japan’s
history. Concern inflation is rising overshadowed the temblor
and a nuclear plant the ensuing tsunami crippled, as well as
turmoil in North Africa.  Treasuries climbed today, pushing down yields, after
Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency raised the rating
of the accident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant to 7, the
highest level, matching the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  “The initial move higher overnight was prompted by what
was going on in Japan, but the ball was taken over by the
performance in risk markets,” said Dan Mulholland, a Treasury
trader in New York at the primary dealer Royal Bank of  Canada .  Inflation Bets  The yield gap between U.S. 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of traders’ outlook for
inflation over the life of the debt called the break-even rate,
was as narrow as 2.57 percentage points today.  The spread widened yesterday to 2.67 percentage points, the
most since March 2008, before a report this week forecast to
show consumer price gains are accelerating. The 10-year break-
even rate for the five years before the onset of the financial
crisis in 2008 averaged 2.42 percentage points. It touched 2.74
percentage points in May 2006.  New York Fed President Dudley said the U.S. economy is
“far away” from what policy makers aim for on employment and
job creation to allow for an exit from record stimulus. The 8.8
percent jobless rate will decline “slowly,” Dudley said today
during a panel discussion in  Hong Kong .  Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said yesterday increases in
commodities will have only a temporary effect on inflation and
don’t warrant a reversal of stimulus.  Doves ‘in Charge’  Several other Fed policy makers said this month it’s time
to pull back stimulus. Philadelphia Fed President  Charles Plosser  said April 1 in Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania , an interest-
rate boost by year-end is “certainly a possibility.”  “The hawks are loud, but at the end of the day, the doves
are in charge of the Fed,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S.
government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based
brokerage for institutional investors. “They are still standing
their ground with the belief that the inflation trade is
something that’s transitory.”  Consumer prices gained 2.6 percent in March from a year
earlier, after increasing at a 2.1 percent pace in February,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before Labor Department
data on April 15. Prices excluding food and fuel may have risen
at an annual pace of 1.2 percent, from 1.1 percent in February.  U.S. retail sales gained 0.5 percent in March, after a 1
percent rise in February, data tomorrow is forecast to show.  Fed Purchases  The Fed will purchase about $97 billion in Treasuries from
tomorrow through May 11 as part of its program to buy $600
billion in U.S. debt through June to spur the economic recovery,
according to a schedule the central bank released today. It will
acquire $4 billion to $6 billion of Treasuries tomorrow due from
October 2012 to September 2013.  Three-year notes at the Treasury’s last auction of the debt
on March 8 yielded 1.298 percent.  The bid-to-cover ratio at today’s offering, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 3.25, compared with an average of 3.14 for the
previous 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 33.7 percent of the notes today,
compared with an average of 37.2 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.9 percent of
the notes, compared with the 10-auction average of 14.1 percent.  Three-year notes have lost 0.3 percent this year, compared
with a 0.6 percent loss for the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Treasury will sell $21 billion in 10-year securities
tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on April 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
