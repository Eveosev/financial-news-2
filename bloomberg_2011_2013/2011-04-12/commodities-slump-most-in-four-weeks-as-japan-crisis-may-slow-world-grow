Commodities slid the most in four
weeks, led by declines in grains, oil and industrial metals, as
 Japan ’s nuclear crisis escalated, potentially slowing the global
economic expansion.  Crude oil retreated in the biggest two-day drop in 11
months after the  International Energy Agency  warned that oil
above $100 a barrel is starting to hurt the global economy.
Wheat and copper tumbled the most in four weeks, while cotton
fell to a six-week low. Japan’s Economic and Fiscal Policy
Minister  Kaoru Yosano  said today the March 11 earthquake may
hurt the economy more than forecast.  “There continues to be concern about what this is doing to
the economy, with particular focus on the situation in Japan,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-
based hedge fund that focuses on energy.  Japan raised the severity rating of its nuclear crisis to
the highest, matching the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, after rising
radiation prompted the government to widen the evacuation zone
and aftershocks rocked the country. The  International Monetary
Fund  yesterday lowered its forecasts for U.S. and Japanese
growth this year.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
dropped 1.9 percent to 359.05 in New York, the biggest loss
since March 15. Yesterday, the gauge fell 0.7 percent after
climbing to 368.96, the highest since September 2008.  Crude Oil Plunges  Crude-oil futures for May delivery fell $3.67, or 3.3
percent, to $106.25 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have tumbled 5.8 percent since April 8, the
biggest two-day slump since May 2010. Futures reached a 30-month
high yesterday on concern that unrest in northern Africa and the
Middle East will curb supplies.  “Seeing the oil market come down has taken some of the
wind out of the inflationary forces that drove commodities to
records,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in  Chicago .  Wheat futures for July delivery slipped 4.7 percent to
$7.9225 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Japan was the
second-biggest buyer of the grain last year after Nigeria. Also
in Chicago, soybeans fell 2.8 percent, and corn dropped 3
percent.  Metals also slid after Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, reported first-quarter sales that missed
analysts’ estimates. Copper futures for May delivery fell 1.7
percent to $4.3835 a pound on the Comex in New York. Lead and
nickel led declines on the London Metal Exchange, where all six
of the main metals retreated.  Gold futures for June delivery fell 1 percent to $1,453.60
an ounce on the Comex, the most since March 15. Silver futures
slid 1.3 percent to $40.066 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
