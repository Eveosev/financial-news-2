Kenya ’s central bank said it is
trying to find a balance between supporting economic growth and
slowing inflation after raising its key lending rate in March,
reversing a cut two months earlier,  Reuters  reported.  The  Central Bank of Kenya  raised its benchmark rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 6 percent to ease pressure on
inflation after food and fuel costs rose, the news agency said,
citing governor Njuguna Ndung’u. Inflation in Kenya surged to
9.19 percent in March from 6.54 percent a month earlier, Reuters
said. The key lending rate increase helped stabilize the
shilling, it said.  The East African nation’s economy grew an estimated 5.4
percent last year, compared with a target for long-term growth
of 10 percent, the  news agency  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
