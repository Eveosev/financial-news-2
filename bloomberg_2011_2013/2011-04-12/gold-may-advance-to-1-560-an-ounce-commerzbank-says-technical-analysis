Gold may rise to $1,560 an ounce by
the end of the year, indicating a 7 percent gain, according to
 technical analysis  by Commerzbank AG.  The $1,560 level is based on point and figure analysis,
Commerzbank analyst  Axel Rudolph  said in a report on April 8.
The attached chart shows gold may first climb to about $1,515,
the 161.8 percent extension of the February 2010 to June 2010
gain, projected from the July low, one of the levels singled out
in so-called Fibonacci analysis.  “Other point and figure targets are at $1,515 and $1,530,
so the $1,515 zone seems important, together with the
psychological $1,500 level,” Rudolph said by e-mail yesterday.
A price of $1,500 may be achieved before three months, he wrote.  Gold climbed to a record $1,478.18 yesterday after gaining
for 10 consecutive years on demand for a protection of wealth
and an alternative to currencies. The metal for immediate
delivery traded at $1,457.79 an ounce by 7:42 a.m. in  London .  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low. A point and figure chart gauges
trends in prices without showing time or volume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
