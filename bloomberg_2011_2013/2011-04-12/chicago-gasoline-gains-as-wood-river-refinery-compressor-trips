Chicago  spot gasoline strengthened
after ConocoPhillips’s Wood River refinery in Illinois reported
a compressor tripped.  The 380,900-barrel-a-day plant flared gases during the
incident yesterday, according to a filing with the Illinois
Emergency Management Agency.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 0.25 cent to 5.75 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:07 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
4.65 cents to $3.094 a gallon.  The same fuel in the Midwest held at a discount of 8.13
cents a gallon.  Holly Corp. (HOC)  flared gases from several units at its refinery
in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after a boiler unit went into “steam
shedding mode,” said Neale Hickerson, a company spokesman.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  is increasing a hydrocracker at its
Port Arthur, Texas, refinery to planned rates,  Bill Day , a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail. A crude unit remains shut
for a repair, he said.  Regular gasoline in the Gulf Coast widened its discount
0.13 cent to 11.88 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
