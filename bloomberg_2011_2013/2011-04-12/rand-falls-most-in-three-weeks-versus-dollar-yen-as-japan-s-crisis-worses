The rand depreciated the most in
more than three weeks against the dollar and yen after
earthquakes shook Tokyo and  Japan  raised the severity level of
its nuclear crisis, damping demand for investment risk.  The South African currency declined as much as 1.3 percent
against the dollar, the most since March 17 on an intraday
basis, and traded 0.8 percent weaker at 6.7132 at 4:49 p.m. in
Johannesburg. It fell as much as 2.4 percent to 12.3965 yen,
also the biggest intraday retreat since March 17.  The severity rating of the Japanese nuclear crisis is now
at the highest level, matching the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, as
aftershocks rock the country. The government said the March 11
quake may result in larger damage to the economy than estimated.  Investors “are now talking of the risk-off trade,”
Tradition Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-based
Quinten Bertenshaw wrote in an e-mailed note. “Such news was
bound to trigger some profit-taking out of emerging-market
currencies, especially the rand, which is not only an emerging-
market currency but exposed to commodity prices which have also
come in for a correction.”  Platinum and copper fell for a second day after the
 International Monetary Fund  cut growth forecasts for Japan and
the U.S. Gold, which together with platinum accounts for one-
fifth of  South Africa ’s exports, also dropped. South Africa’s
benchmark stock index declined for the first day in three, led
by mining companies  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  and  Anglo American Plc. (AGL)   Government bonds  fell as investors sold emerging-market
assets. The 13.5 percent bond due 2015 lost 10 cents to 120.99
rand, driving the yield up 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 7.79 percent. The 10.5 percent security due 2026
slipped 78 cents to 114.53 rand, pushing the yield 8 basis
points higher to 8.77 percent.  “Local bonds have reflected this rotation back to safety
with the entire yield curve shifting a little higher,”
Tradition Analytics said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
