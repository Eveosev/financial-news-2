Brazil’s real rose a day after its
biggest selloff in four months on speculation rising  interest
rates  and higher commodity prices will attract investors.  The real gained 0.5 percent to 1.5758 per dollar as of 9:11
a.m.  New York  time, from 1.5833 yesterday when it lost 0.9
percent in its biggest decline since December. The currency is
up 5.4 percent this year.  “After a big correction yesterday, the market has sort of
found a temporary level that they are comfortable with,” said
 Tony Volpon , Latin America strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in
New York. “Based on commodity prices, rate differentials and
risk sentiment, the real is well valued around these levels.”  Traders are betting Brazil’s policy makers will boost
benchmark borrowing costs by at least 0.25 percentage point, or
25 basis points, at the April 19-20 meeting, from 11.75 percent,
according to Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate futures.
The U.S. Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate is between
zero and 0.25 percent. Prices of commodities, such as sugar and
soy, have gained 9.6 percent this year, according to the UBS
Bloomberg CMCI index.  Brazil ’s retail sales fell 0.4 percent in February,
compared with an increase of 1.1 percent in January, the
national statistics agency said today in  Rio de Janeiro . The
median forecast from 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
the sales to remain unchanged.  Yields on interest-rate futures contracts due in January
2012 dropped 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.28
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
