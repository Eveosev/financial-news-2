Britain’s statistics agency said an
initial investigation into a possible leak of inflation data
today found no evidence that they were released early.  “We are aware of rumours in the City that the inflation
figures published at 9.30 a.m. today may have been leaked in
advance of publication,” the  Office for National Statistics 
said in an e-mail, referring to  London ’s financial center. “Our
initial check shows no evidence of such a leak.”  The report showed inflation unexpectedly slowed for the
first time in eight months in March, with consumer prices rising
4 percent from a year earlier compared with 4.4 percent in
February. The pound fell to its lowest level in a week against
the dollar and to its weakest in six months versus the euro
after the release.  “There were major movements in the exchange rates for the
pound at 9.30 a.m. as would be expected,” the ONS said. “We
are continuing to review the situation.”  Today’s data caused BNP Paribas SA and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
to push back their forecasts for the  Bank of England  to raise
its benchmark interest rate from a record low of 0.5 percent.
BNP economist Alan Clarke and JPMorgan economist Malcolm Barr
predict the central bank will raise the benchmark rate to 0.75
percent in August rather than in May.  Investors pushed back bets for a quarter-point rate
increase to October, according to data compiled by Tullett
Prebon Plc. A quarter-point rate rise by July had been priced in
as recently as April 8, according to forward contracts on the
sterling overnight interbank average, or Sonia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
