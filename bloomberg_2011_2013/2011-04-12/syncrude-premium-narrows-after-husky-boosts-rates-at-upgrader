The premium for Syncrude fell after
 Husky Energy Inc. (HSE)  said late yesterday it boosted rates at its
Lloydminster oil-sands upgrader in Saskatchewan after a Feb. 2
fire cut output.  The upgrader is operating at 75 percent to 85 percent of
capacity and moving toward full production, the Calgary-based
company said in a statement. The upgrader, which can process up
to 82,000 barrels daily, operated at 40 percent to 50 percent of
normal rates during the repairs.  Syncrude’s premium versus West Texas Intermediate narrowed
75 cents to $11.50 a barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur
synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$16.75 a barrel.  U.S. Gulf crudes’ premiums versus West  Texas  Intermediate
strengthened as Brent oil’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
widened. The gap between prompt-month WTI and its European
counterpart, increased 79 cents to $14.85 a barrel at 1:22 p.m.
in  New York .  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 70 cents to
$17.50 a barrel at 11:36 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 80
cents to $18 over the benchmark.  Among  Gulf Coast  sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
strengthened 45 cents to $10.80 a barrel over WTI, and
Poseidon’s premium strengthened 45 cents to $11.25.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened 75 cents to $10 a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium was unchanged at $15 a barrel
over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $3.45 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
