European stocks fell the most in
four weeks as Tokyo Electric Power Co. said its earthquake-hit
nuclear power plant may release more radiation than Chernobyl
and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  posted sales that missed analysts’ estimates.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, led
mining stocks lower as metal prices fell.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
and BP Plc dropped as a gauge of European  oil companies  sank the
most in 11 months.  Delta Lloyd NV (DL)  dropped 7.6 percent, the
largest decline since its initial public offering in 2009.  Game
Group Plc (GMG)  sank 8.3 percent after UBS AG cut its recommendation
on the shares.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell 1.7 percent to 276.24 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge retreated yesterday as
a magnitude-6.6 aftershock struck Japan a month after the
nation’s biggest earthquake on record and subsequent tsunami
left about 27,500 dead or missing.  “What we’ve learned this morning makes the situation more
fragile” in  Japan , said Yves Maillot, head of investments at
Robeco Gestions in Paris, which oversees $6.78 billion in Paris.
“The market has underestimated the catastrophe on a
macroeconomic level. Japan is strongly destabilized. This has
happened in an environment that was already difficult.”  Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency raised the
severity rating of the nuclear crisis at its stricken Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant to seven, the same as the 1986 Chernobyl
disaster. The facility’s damaged reactors have already leaked
about 10 percent of the radiation that Chernobyl released. Level
seven accidents mean that there has been a “major release of
radioactive material with widespread health and environmental
effects requiring implementation of planned and extended
countermeasures,” according to the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which helped establish the system.  Japan’s Economy  Japan’s Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister  Kaoru Yosano 
said that the country’s earthquake may result in a larger hit to
the economy than the government had previously estimated.  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the western
European markets, except Greece. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index and
France’s CAC 40 Index lost 1.5 percent, while Germany’s DAX
Index fell 1.4 percent.  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, reported first-
quarter revenue of $5.96 billion, missing the average estimate
of $6.06 billion from eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  U.K. Retail Sales  The  British Retail Consortium  said U.K. retail sales
dropped by a record in March. Accelerating inflation squeezed
households’ finances and concern that employers will cut jobs
prompted people to hold back spending, the trade body said.  Sales at stores measured by value fell 1.9 percent from a
year earlier, partly due to the timing of Easter in 2010, the
London-based BRC said. That’s the biggest drop since the series
began in 1995 and compares with a 1.1 percent gain in February.
On a like-for-like basis, which excludes store openings, sales
dropped 3.5 percent, the most since 2005.  German investor confidence fell in April more than
economists had forecast after the  European Central Bank  raised
 interest rates  and Portugal become the third euro-area nation to
ask for a bailout.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict developments six months in advance, declined to 7.6
from 14.1 in March. Economists had predicted a drop to 11.3,
according to the median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Basic Resources  A measure of basic-resource shares in the Stoxx 600 slid
4.3 percent, its largest drop since Nov. 16, as copper, lead and
nickel prices fell in London.  BHP declined 3.3 percent to 2,544 pence and  Rio Tinto 
slipped 2.8 percent to 4,403 pence.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , Kazakhstan’s
biggest copper producer, tumbled 5 percent to 1,419 pence.
Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. sank 4.3 percent to 929.5
pence.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s largest primary silver
producer, lost 5.1 percent to 1,576 pence.  Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, fell 2.6
percent to 2,229.5 pence, while BP slumped 2.8 percent to 461.4
pence. Crude for May settlement fell $3.96, or 3.6 percent, to
$105.96 a barrel at 12:15 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Delta Lloyd  plunged 7.6 percent to 17.54 euros, the largest
drop on the Stoxx 600, after Aviva Plc, Britain’s second-biggest
insurer by market value, said it plans to sell a 15 percent
stake in the Dutch insurance company. Aviva lost 2 percent to
443.7 pence.  Game Group, Punch  Game Group sank 8.3 percent to 49.5 pence, its lowest price
since May 2003, after UBS reduced Europe’s biggest computer-
games retailer to “sell” from “neutral.”  Punch Taverns Plc (PUB)  lost 5.3 percent to 75.3 pence after the
U.K. operator of more than 6,700 pubs posted a 324.8 million-
pound ($528 million) loss in its fiscal first half after taking
a 367 million-pound impairment charge. The owner of the Fayre &
Square and Flaming Grill brands generated a 59.2 million-pound
profit a year earlier.  Renault SA (RNO) , France’s second-largest carmaker by sales,
tumbled 3.2 percent to 37.75 euros. The company accepted Patrick Pelata’s resignation from his post as Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn’s
second-in-command over a botched espionage investigation that
led to the wrongful dismissal of three senior managers.  SGL Carbon SE (SGL)  slid 4.8 percent to 37.50 euros, the largest
retreat since June. HSBC Holdings Plc cut the stock to
“underweight” from “neutral.”  Chipmakers Slide  Semiconductor makers retreated after Micrel Inc., a U.S.
chipmaker, said its first-quarter profit missed the company’s
earlier forecast and the average analyst estimate.
 STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , Europe’s biggest chipmaker, dropped 3.9
percent to 8.25 euros.  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX) , the region’s
second-largest, lost 4.7 percent to 7.01 euros.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  gained 1.8 percent to
96.2 euro cents after the lender said it plans to distribute
more than 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in dividends over the
next five years. Italy’s third-biggest bank by sales also plans
to raise as much as 2.47 billion euros by selling new shares and
repurchasing hybrid securities to strengthen its finances before
repaying government aid. The lender will sell as much as 2
billion euros of common stock to owners of common and savings
shares.  National Express Group Plc (NEX)  climbed 4.5 percent to 250.1
pence. Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd., the largest investor in
 National Express , said it has the backing of the Cosmen family,
the second-biggest shareholder, to appoint new board members to
the operator of the Stansted Express train service between
 London  and Stansted Airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
