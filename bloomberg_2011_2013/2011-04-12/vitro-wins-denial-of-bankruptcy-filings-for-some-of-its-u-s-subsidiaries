Vitro SAB, the Mexican glassmaker,
defeated a move by creditors to force some of its U.S. units
into bankruptcy while other involuntary petitions will remain
“under advisement” by a judge.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Russell Nelms in  Fort Worth ,  Texas ,
denied involuntary bankruptcy petitions filed against three
Vitro operating companies, according to a court order yesterday.
Involuntary cases filed against a group of non-operating U.S.
units will remain “under advisement,” the judge wrote.  Creditors of Vitro, which defaulted on $1.2 billion in
bonds in 2009, filed the involuntary petitions last year.
Vitro’s U.S. units issued guarantees on the debt. Nelms held a
hearing on the involuntary petitions that ended April 1.  Last week, Nelms granted a request by Vitro to put four of
the U.S. units into bankruptcy. Vitro plans to sell the assets
of two of the companies to private-equity firm Grey Mountain
Partners LLC.  The case is In re Vitro Asset Corp., 10-47470, U.S.
 Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth).  To contact the reporter on this story:
