Neo Solar Power Corp. (3576)  led solar
energy-related companies lower in Taipei trading after the
Economic Daily News cited Chairman Quincy Lin as saying cell
prices may fall in April on concern Europe will cut back on
solar subsidies in the second quarter.   The stock slid the maximum 7 percent to NT$68.30, the most
since Sept. 27.  Sino-American Silicon Products Inc. (5483)  slumped 6.9
percent to NT$121.50, set for the most since Oct. 4.  Motech
Industries Inc. (6244)  lost 5.9 percent to NT$120. Thomas Hsu,
spokesman for Neo Solar, wasnâ€™t immediately available for
