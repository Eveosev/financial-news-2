(Corrects name of company in headline.)  Cocoa production in  Ivory Coast ,
the world’s biggest grower, may continue to be disrupted because
farmers fled plantations during the violence that followed a
disputed presidential election, according to  Exclusive Analysis .  Unrest is likely to continue in the cocoa-producing
southwest, as well as the main port and commercial center of
Abidjan and the capital Yamoussoukro, even after the capture of
the country’s former president,  Laurent Gbagbo , said Robert
Besseling, a senior Africa forecaster at the London-based
specialist intelligence company.  “The production of cocoa has been affected because of
widespread fighting and displacement of almost 1 million
people,” Besseling said today in a telephone interview. “Farms
have been neglected, and we could continue to see religious and
ethnic violence in some of the regions.”  Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of
the November election, has been battling Gbagbo for control of
the West African nation.  Ouattara faces significant risks of a coup for the next
year from groups that have refused to recognize him as the
legitimate president, Besseling said.  Cocoa growers in Ivory Coast are just beginning to gather
the mid-crop, the smaller of two annual harvests, according to
Macquarie Group Ltd. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
