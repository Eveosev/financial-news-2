Medtronic Inc. (MDT)  is the focus of a
broadened investigation by the  Justice Department  into the
marketing of Infuse, a spinal infusion device, the New York
Times reported, citing an unidentified doctor who had been
contacted by investigators.  Recently the  Food and Drug Administration  rejected a higher
strength version of Infuse, called Amplify, because of questions
over a higher rate of cancer in patients treated with the
enhanced version; Infuse is approved for use by the FDA, the
newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
