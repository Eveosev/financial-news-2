German bunds rose as an index of
investor confidence fell more than forecast and  Japan  raised the
severity rating for its nuclear crisis, driving equities lower
and boosting demand for the safety of government debt.  Two-year notes snapped a two-day decline, even as a report
showed inflation in  Germany  unexpectedly accelerated to the
fastest pace in 2 1/2 years. The Stoxx  Europe  600 fell 1.8
percent. Portuguese and Greek government debt declined as
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Neel Kashkari said the
nations will likely restructure their debt.  “The market is on a risk-off mode because of the latest
situation in Japan, and that’s bond-positive,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “We have an inflation report from
Germany which is a shade firmer than expected, but given that
the market has already priced in aggressive rate hikes by the
 European Central Bank , this data might not be strong enough to
deter safe-haven flows.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bund slipped five basis
points to 3.44 percent as of 4:20 p.m. in London. It yesterday
reached 3.50 percent for the first time since Aug. 13, 2009. The
2.5 percent security maturing January 2021 climbed 0.385, or
3.85 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,443) face amount, to 92.315. The
two-year note yield dropped six basis points, to 1.85 percent.  ZEW Index  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research’s index of
investor and analyst expectations, which aims to predict
developments six months in advance, slumped to 7.6 in April from
14.1 in March. The median forecast of 36 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was a drop to 11.3. The consumer-price
inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method, increased to 2.3 percent in March.  U.S. bonds also gained, pushing the 10-year yield nine
basis points lower. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped 1
percent.  Portuguese bonds declined as IMF, European Commission and
ECB officials met in Lisbon today to start preparing an
estimated 80 billion-euro aid program for the nation. IMF Chief
Economist Olivier Blanchard yesterday said both  Portugal  and
 Greece  may need financing aid “for some time” as their
governments carry out tough fiscal measures.  Europe’s most-indebted countries will probably need to
restructure their borrowings as bailouts fail to solve their
fundamental challenges, Pimco’s Kashkari said today.  Pimco View  “Greece, Ireland, Portugal simply have too much debt, more
debt than their economies can afford,” Kashkari, head of new
investment initiatives at Pimco, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television. “It’s likely they’ll need to restructure
or default. The question is, how do you do that in an orderly
manner without causing contagion to  Spain  and other countries
and causing chaos?”  The yield on 10-year Portuguese bonds rose one basis point
to 8.64 percent, while the yield on similar maturity Greek debt
added two basis points to 12.88 percent.  Irish bonds advanced for an eighth day, pushing the 10-year
yield down five basis points to 9.11 percent. The nation’s
borrowing costs have fallen by over 100 basis points since bank
stress-test results on March 31.  LCH Clearnet Ltd. said it will reduce the extra deposit
charge for customers betting Irish  government bonds  will
appreciate to 35 percent from 45 percent.  German government bonds have handed investors a 3.1 percent
loss this year, while U.S. Treasuries are 0.6 percent lower,
according to indexes compiled by the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Portuguese debt is
the worst performer among the euro-region nations, dropping 10.3
percent this year, while Irish securities have lost 0.2 percent.
Spanish debt gained 2.7 percent in the same period.  The Netherlands today sold 1.57 billion euros of 3.75
percent bonds due in January 2042 at an average yield of 4.03
percent. Greece issued 1.625 billion euros of 26-week Treasury
bills at a yield of 4.8 percent, while  Italy  sold 7.5 billion
euros of 367-day bills at 1.98 percent and  Belgium  auctioned 91-
day and 371-day bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
