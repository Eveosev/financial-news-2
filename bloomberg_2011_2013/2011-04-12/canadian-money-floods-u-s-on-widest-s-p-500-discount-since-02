Canadian investors are buying U.S.
stocks at the fastest pace in at least six years after
valuations for the benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange index rose
to the highest level compared with American equities since 2002.  Money managers in  Canada  overseeing a combined $227 billion
bought $288.7 million more of U.S. shares than they sold in the
four weeks ending March 23, the most in any comparable period
since at least 2004, data compiled by Emerging Portfolio Fund
Research Inc. show. Companies in the Standard & Poor’s/Toronto
Stock Exchange Composite Index trade for 20.8 times earnings, 34
percent more than the  S&P 500 , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The S&P/TSX beat the S&P 500 each year since 2003, rising
almost five times as much, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Surging demand for commodities drove up producers of
oil, gold and copper and Canada avoided a banking crisis. None
of the 34 managers polled by  Russell Investments  said in
February that Canadian shares were cheap, a first for the five-
year-old survey.  “The U.S. market represents better value than the Canadian
market simply because of the multiple,” said Daniel L. Bain,
who manages C$400 million ($418 million) as chief investment
officer of Thornmark Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. “We have
reduced Canadian allocations modestly.”  Thornmark increased the U.S. share of its North American
equity fund to 42 percent from 38 percent over the past quarter,
Bain said. Its money managers bought and sold shares based on
their expectations for individual companies, not because of
marketwide projections.  Currency’s Gain  Canadian stocks are also relatively expensive because the
nation’s currency climbed to a three-year high of $1.0497 on
April 8, 33 percent more than its 30-year average, helped by the
145 percent surge in the S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities since
February 2009. Energy and materials stocks make up 51 percent of
the value of Canadian equities by market capitalization.  The percentage of Russell survey respondents who said they
were bullish on Canadian stocks fell to 68 percent in February
from 77 percent in the fourth quarter. Optimism on U.S. equities
rose to 64 percent from 54 percent.  The S&P/TSX has gained 19.2 percent compared with the S&P
500’s 18.8 percent since the end of 2009, even as U.S. companies
posted almost twice the earnings growth, the data show. That’s
driven the valuation for the Canadian equity benchmark to within
4.1 percent of its highest level since 2003.  Encana, Exxon  Encana Corp. (ECA)  of Calgary, Canada’s largest natural-gas
producer, trades for 37.4 times reported per-share profit. By
contrast, Exxon Mobil Corp. in Irving,  Texas , is priced at 13.6,
given a record valuation gap between the companies.  The premium for Toronto-based  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the
world’s largest producer of the precious metal, over its biggest
U.S. peer,  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  in  Greenwood Village ,  Colorado ,
climbed last month to 39 percent, the most since 2005, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Will the American market do better than the Canadian
market this year and next year? On a rational basis, it probably
should,” said Tim Regan, who helps manage C$1.2 billion at
Kingwest & Co. in Toronto. “So we’ve been accumulating more in
the U.S. market.”  Kingwest’s C$237.8 million  Northwest Canadian Equity Fund 
has increased the U.S. share of its holdings to 27 percent from
23 percent in September with purchases including New York-based
Citigroup Inc. and Corrections Corp. of America in Nashville,
 Tennessee , Regan said. The fund reduced stakes in flight-
simulator maker  CAE Inc. (CAE)  in Saint-Laurent,  Quebec , and Toronto-
based automotive parts retailer Canadian Tire Corp. as the
valuations increased.  Confidence in Commodities  The S&P/TSX has a higher valuation than the S&P 500 because
of confidence commodities will rise and on investor concern the
 U.S. economy  will falter, said Pat McHugh, Canadian equity
strategist for Manulife Financial Corp.’s asset manager, which
oversees C$209 billion.  Analysts forecast gold will climb to a record $1,500 an
ounce by the fourth quarter and copper will surpass its all-time
high in the first quarter of next year, according to the median
estimates of 19 and 15 analysts in Bloomberg surveys.  The S&P 500 will end the year with a total return of 10
percent to 12 percent, compared with 8 percent to 9 percent for
the S&P/TSX, said Bob Gorman, the chief portfolio strategist for
Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Waterhouse unit.  This year, the S&P/TSX has risen 4.1 percent, compared with
5.3 percent for the S&P 500. The S&P/TSX outperformed its U.S.
counterpart each year since 2003, rising 64 percent through Dec.
31, versus 13 percent for the S&P 500.  “I don’t think the TSX is overvalued,” Gorman said. “I
do expect it to go higher. But relatively speaking, I would say
the U.S. is somewhat less expensive and more attractive from a
valuation perspective.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
