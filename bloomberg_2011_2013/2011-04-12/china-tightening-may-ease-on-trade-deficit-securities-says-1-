The most intensive phase of  China ’s
monetary tightening may end if the nation reports more trade
deficits or small monthly surpluses, the official  China
Securities Journal  said in a front page editorial today.  The world’s second-biggest economy had a $1.02 billion
trade deficit in the first three months of this year, the first
quarterly shortfall in seven years.  “An improvement in the balance of international payments
is conducive to alleviating inflation pressure and expanding the
room for monetary policy maneuvering,” the editorial said. It
will also allow for an increase in the flexibility of the yuan’s
exchange rate, according to the paper, which is owned by the
official Xinhua news agency.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  has pledged to contain gains in food and
housing prices that may undermine social stability. The central
bank has raised  interest rates  four times and boosted lenders’
reserve requirements six times since the third quarter of last
year to curb inflation.  The tightening cycle is near its end, with credit
conditions now “very tight,” Macquarie Group Ltd. economists
wrote in a note yesterday. “The risk is now slowing growth
rather than spiraling inflation,” analysts led by Paul Cavey
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
