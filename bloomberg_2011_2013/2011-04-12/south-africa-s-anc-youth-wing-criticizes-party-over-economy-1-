The youth league of  South Africa ’s
ruling  African National Congress  slammed the party for failing
sweep aside the legacy of apartheid and reiterated a call for
the nationalization of banks and mines.  “Vestiges of apartheid and colonial economic patterns,
ownership and control remain intact despite the attainment of
political freedom,” the ANC Youth League said in an e-mailed
discussion document today.  A substandard education has left about half of black South
Africans aged between 15 and 24 without jobs and contributed to
a wealth gap that condemns 22 percent of the population to
survive on less than 283 rand ($42) a month, according to
government data. Income inequality is little changed since the
end of white rule in 1994.  “The ANC did not use the political power at its disposal
to transfer the economy from the minority to the people as a
whole,” the youth league said. “Political freedom without
economic emancipation is meaningless.”  The ANC Youth League called on the government to seize
mines, banks and land without compensation, and demanded greater
state involvement in the economy.  “A supposition that the South African economy can be
transformed to address the massive unemployment, poverty and
inequality crisis without transfer of wealth from those who
currently own it to the people as a whole is illusionary,” the
league said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
