Europe ’s gasoil futures market
moved into a contango structure, meaning contracts closest to
delivery cost less than those expiring later.  Futures for May delivery traded at $1,038.50 a metric ton
on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 9:42 a.m. local
time. That’s 25 cents less than the June contract. Gasoil is
mainly used in heating.  ICE gasoil contracts closest to delivery had cost more than
later-dated contracts, a structure called backwardation, since
March 11. Today’s move to contango from backwardation signals
demand is easing or supply is rising.  The April contract, which expires today, traded at
$1,038.50 a ton as of 9:48 a.m. local time. That’s 50 cents more
than May futures. The April contract traded earlier today at a
$2 discount to the May contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
