Mobile Telecommunications Co.
shareholders elected a new board at the annual general meeting
of the company also known as Zain, bringing in two new members.  The board no longer includes Sheikh Khalifa Ali Al-Sabah,
whose  Al-Fawares Holding Co.  owns a 4.5 percent stake in Zain.
Sheikh Khalifa opposed any sale of Zain,  Kuwait ’s biggest phone
company, to Emirates Telecommunications Corp., or Etisalat,
which last month announced the end of talks to buy a majority
stake in Zain.  The new board members are Bader al-Kharafi, deputy chairman
of Kuwait’s Kharafi Group, and Shaikha al-Bahar, National Bank
of Kuwait’s chief executive officer for Kuwait. Al-Khair
National for Stocks & Real Estate Co., Zain’s second-biggest
shareholder which is owned by the Kharafi group, led the failed
stake sale to Etisalat. The Kharafi group has since raised its
stake to 16.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
