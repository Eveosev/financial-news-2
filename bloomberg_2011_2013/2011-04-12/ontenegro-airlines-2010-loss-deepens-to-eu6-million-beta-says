State-owned Montenegro Airlines had
a 6 million-euro ($8.64 million) loss last year and plans to cut
workforce,  Beta   news agency  reported, citing Chairman Zoran
Djurisic.  Djurisic blamed the rising cost of fuel for the loss, which
deepened from 3.98 million euros in 2009, and said the number of
employees will fall to 250 or 300 from 450 at present, according
to the report. He was also quoted as saying he expects that
 Serbia and Montenegro Air Traffic Services Agency  will write off
4 million euros owed by the company.  The carrier that flies to 20 destinations in  Europe ,
received state guarantees last week for 9.6 million euros in
loans for fleet maintenance, for adding another Embraer 195 to
its fleet of five Fokker 100s and three Embraer 195s and for
opening new routes.  Speaking in Podgorica, Djurisic said the airline would have
to review its plans for new destinations, as well as the
existing ones, Beta reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
