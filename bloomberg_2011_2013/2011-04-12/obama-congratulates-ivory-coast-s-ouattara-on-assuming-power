U.S. President Barack Obama today
called  Alassane Ouattara , the president of the Ivory Coast, to
congratulate him on assuming power following his election, the
White House said in a statement.  Obama offered U.S. support for Ouattara’s efforts to unite
the country and restore security following a contentious
election, the statement said.  Ouattara assumed the presidency after the Ivory Coast’s
former leader,  Laurent Gbagbo , was arrested yesterday for
refusing to recognize the results of a Nov. 28 election where
Ouattara was declared the winner.  Obama and Ouattara discussed the importance of investigated
“alleged atrocities” that may have been committed in the
country and pledged to support a United Nations inquiry, the
statement said. They also talked about re-establishing trade and
economic relationship to help “jumpstart” the  Ivory Coast ’s
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
