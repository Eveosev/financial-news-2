Univision Communications Inc., the
most-watched U.S. Spanish-language  broadcast network , is in
talks with pay-TV operators to create three cable channels, a
person with knowledge of the situation said.  The broadcaster, based in  New York , wants to start a
channel for telenovelas, or soap operas, later this year, a
sports outlet in 2012 and possibly a 24-hour news network, said
the person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.  The company is seeking to expand on cable while its
broadcast network is growing in total viewers and in the 18-
to-49-year-old audience advertisers seek. Univision plans to
spend $20 million to $30 million on new TV networks and sales
efforts, and another $40 million on soccer TV rights, the Wall
Street Journal reported earlier today.  Univision is owned by Madison Dearborn Partners,  Providence
Equity Partners , Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, TPG Capital and
billionaire  Haim Saban . They took the company private in a $12.3
billion buyout in 2007. Mexico City-based Grupo Televisa agreed
in October to acquire as much as 35 percent of the company for
$1.2 billion.  Saban, Univision’s chairman, took on added duties after Joe Uva, chief executive officer, departed the company earlier this
month. The company plans to seek a successor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
