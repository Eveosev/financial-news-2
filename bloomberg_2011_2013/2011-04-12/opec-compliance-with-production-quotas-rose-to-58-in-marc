The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’ compliance with record production cuts
increased to 58 percent last month as fighting in  Libya  cut the
country’s output by more than 70 percent.  Daily production from the 11 OPEC members that are bound by
quotas was 26.6 million barrels a day last month, the group’s
Vienna-based secretariat said today in its monthly oil market
report. That implies a compliance rate of 58 percent, according
to Bloomberg calculations. Output fell from 27.29 million
barrels in February, when compliance was at 42 percent.  “The crude oil output increases from Angola, Iraq,  Saudi
Arabia , Venezuela,  Kuwait  and the United Arab Emirates partially
offset the disruption in Libyan oil production,” OPEC said.  The group’s total production fell to 29.31 barrels a day in
March from 29.94 million barrels a day the previous month.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 amid a
collapse in global demand. The decision capped production at
24.845 million barrels a day for all members except  Iraq , which
is exempt from the quota system. Adherence to 4.2 million
barrel-a-day cut eased in 2009 and 2010 as prices rebounded.  Compliance percentages are based on combined output from
the 11 members that committed to reduce from a base production
rate in September 2008 of 29.045 million barrels a day.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
