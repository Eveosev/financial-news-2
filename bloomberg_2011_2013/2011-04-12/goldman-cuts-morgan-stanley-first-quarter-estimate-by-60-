Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its
first-quarter earnings estimate for Morgan Stanley by 60 percent
on expectation of lower interest rate, credit and  currency
trading  revenue.  Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, had
its earnings estimate lowered to 32 cents from 80 cents,
analysts Daniel Harris and  Richard Ramsden  said today in a note.
Full-year estimates for 2011 and 2012 were cut to $2 per share
from $2.75 and $2.65 from $3.05, respectively. The average
first-quarter estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is
38 cents.  Revenue from interest rate, credit and currency trading
will be $1 billion, down from the previous estimate of $1.7
billion, as charges from its hedging of exposure to monoline
insurers affect results by $400 million to $500 million,
according to the note. New York-based  Morgan Stanley (MS)  will also
face a $300 million charge related to the narrowing of its
credit spreads, the note said.  Investment-banking revenue will be $100 million lower than
previously estimated, according to the note. Merger and
acquisition advisory revenue will be down 14 percent from the
fourth quarter. Global wealth-management revenue of $3.3 billion
in the fourth quarter will be flat because of a decline in
client activity, Harris and Ramsden said in the note.  Morgan Stanley fell 24 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $26.67 at
10:55 a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
