Masdar,  Abu Dhabi ’s renewable-
energy project, had a loss of 847 million dirhams ($230 million)
last year, according to a bond prospectus distributed by parent
Mubadala Development Co. and obtained by Bloomberg.  The renewable-energy units of Mubadala, a government-owned
 investment company , consist mainly of Masdar City and Masdar’s
investment projects and power plant developments, according to
the bond prospectus. A spokesman for Masdar didn’t have an
immediate response to e-mailed questions on the accounts.  Masdar is a key component in the effort by Abu Dhabi, the
largest sheikhdom in the  United Arab Emirates , to generate at
least 7 percent of the power it uses from renewable sources by
2020. The nation’s capital, it holds almost all of the country’s
oil reserves, and is expanding use of solar and wind power in an
effort to become a regional hub for renewable energy.  The renewable-energy segment had operating income of 419
million dirhams last year and total assets of 7.98 billion
dirhams at the end of last year, according to the document.  -- With assistance from Camilla Hall in Dubai. Editors: John Buckley, Rob Verdonck  To contact the reporters on this story:
