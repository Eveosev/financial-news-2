Taiwan ’s dollar retreated from a
two-month high on speculation policy makers will intervene to
counter appreciation that may hurt exports.  Currencies and shares fell across Asia’s developing
economies as a magnitude-6.3 earthquake rattled  Japan , which is
struggling to regain control of a nuclear power plant following
a record temblor on March 11. Damage stemming from last month’s
quake may reduce Taiwan’s economic growth by as much as 0.2
percentage point, Premier  Wu Den-yih  said March 29. The island’s
central bank sold the local dollar in late trading yesterday,
according to two traders who declined to be identified.  “We are seeing some buying orders for U.S. dollars because
some banks are afraid the central bank may intervene,” said
Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader at the Union Bank
of Taiwan.  Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.4 percent to NT$29.112 against
its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. local close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.874 yesterday, the strongest
level since Feb. 10. The local dollar has climbed 4.3 percent
this year,  Asia ’s best-performing major currency.  Foreign funds sold $180 million more Taiwan stocks than
they bought today, the first net sales in 12 days, according to
exchange data.  Exports rose 16.7 percent in March from a year earlier,
slowing from February’s 27.3 percent increase, a government
report showed yesterday.  Government bonds  were little changed, with the yield on the
1.375 percent note due March 2021 at 1.344 percent, according to
Gretai Securities Market, the island’s biggest exchange for
bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
