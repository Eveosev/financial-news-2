U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  will tell  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  it is in its
own “enlightened self-interest” to sell off a large number of
branches in addition to the 600 the European Union has said it
must divest to boost competition in the banking sector, the
Financial Times reported, citing an ally of Osborne’s.  The lender should begin planning for the disposals before
the  Independent Banking Commission’s  final banking review is
published in September, the FT said, citing the person.  Failure to do so could prompt the commission to specify the
number of branches Lloyds would be expected to sell, the FT
said, citing a person familiar with the commission’s thinking.  That could amount to as many as 1,000 branches and
disposing of that many could cut the bank’s 2013 pretax profit
by 17 percent, the FT said, citing Morgan Stanley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
