OPEC’s compliance with record cuts
in crude supply rose in March as violent unrest halted
production in  Libya , the  International Energy Agency  said.  The 11 members of the producer group that are bound by
quotas pumped 26.51 million barrels a day last month, the lowest
output since May 2010, the Paris-based IEA said today in its
monthly report. That implies an overall compliance rate of 60
percent, up from 40 percent last month.  Supply from all 12 nations of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries decreased by about 880,000 barrels a day to
29.2 million barrels, the IEA said. Production declined in
Nigeria and Iraq as well as Libya.  Higher production in  Saudi Arabia ,  Kuwait  and the United
Arab Emirates, together with a seasonal ebb in refinery runs,
“helped avert a supply crisis,” the IEA said. “The demand for
OPEC crude is likely to rise again substantially” by the second
half of this year, it warned.  OPEC, which provides about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 amid a
collapse in global demand. The decision capped production at
24.845 million barrels a day for all members except  Iraq , which
is exempt from the quota system. Adherence to the cut of 4.2
million barrels a day eased last year and in 2009 as prices
rebounded.  Compliance percentages are based on combined output from
the 11 members that committed to reduce from a base production
rate in September 2008 of 29.045 million barrels a day.  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, pumped 8.9 million
barrels a day in March, unchanged from February, the IEA
estimated.  OPEC’s other members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran ,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates
and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
