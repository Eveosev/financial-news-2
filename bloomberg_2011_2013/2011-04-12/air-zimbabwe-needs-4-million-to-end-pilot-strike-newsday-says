Air Zimbabwe, the African nation’s
state-owned carrier, needs at least $4 million to pay pilots to
end a strike that began on March 23,  Newsday  reported, citing
acting Chief Executive Officer Innocent Mavhunga.  The airline can’t afford arrears it owes to pilots and
engineers after it last year cut salaries to between $1,000 and
$1,500 a month from between $3,000 and $7,000, the Harare-based
newspaper cited Mavhunga as saying yesterday.  Air Zimbabwe employs 49 pilots, though of the company’s
aircraft, only two Boeing 767s, two Boeing 737s and one MA60 are
currently functioning, Newsday said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
