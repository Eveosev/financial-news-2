Skymark Airlines Inc. (9204)  plans to
start flying from  Tokyo ’s Narita airport in November, becoming
the first budget carrier to open a hub at Japan’s main
international gateway.  The airline will operate 25 flights a day by September 2014
to nine domestic destinations, including Asahikawa, Fukuoka and
Sapporo, President Shinichi Nishikubo, who owns 49 percent of
the carrier, told reporters in Tokyo today. Fares will be as low
as 980 yen ($12) one way, he said.  “We want to try something that no one has ever done,” he
said. Fees at Narita are also cheaper than Haneda, Tokyo’s
predominately domestic airport, he said.  Skymark will expand its fleet of  Boeing Co. (BA)  737s to 27 from
18 by March 2013 as it adds new routes, Nishikubo said. The
Tokyo-based airline also ordered four Airbus SAS A380
superjumbos as it prepares to challenge All Nippon Airways Co.
and  Japan  Airlines Co. on flights to London beginning in 2014.  Skymark’s cheap prices helped it withstand a slump in Japan
air travel since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami crippled a
nuclear-power plant, Nishikubo said. JAL, Cathay Pacific Airways
Ltd. and Singapore Airlines Ltd. have pared Japan services since
the temblor.  “The earthquake has had almost no impact on sales,” he
said.  Skymark, which is listed on the startup Mothers section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, fell 1.3 percent to 904 yen at the 3
p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The shares have fallen 23
percent since March 10, compared with a 17 percent decline for
Tokyo-based All Nippon.  The discount carrier confirmed an order for four A380
superjumbos in February and may expand its fleet to as many as
15, Nishikubo said last year. The airline also plans to add
 Frankfurt  and New York routes by fiscal 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
