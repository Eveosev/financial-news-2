Tommy Amaker will remain men’s
basketball coach at  Harvard University , shunning the chance to
fill other coaching vacancies.  “I am appreciative of and flattered by the interest shown
in me by other fine universities, but I am proud and honored to
represent Harvard,” Amaker said today in a news release on the
school’s website. “I look forward to continuing my efforts to
teach, lead and serve at this great institution.”  Amaker didn’t identify the schools that approached him.  University of Miami officials flew to Boston yesterday to
try to convince Amaker to succeed Frank Haith, who left the
Hurricanes last week for the University of Missouri, the Miami
Herald reported.  Harvard went 23-7 last season under Amaker, 45, earning a
share of its first  Ivy League  title with a 79-67 win against
 Princeton University  on March 5. It then lost by one point to
Princeton in a playoff game that gave the Tigers the Ivy
League’s berth in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament.  The Crimson went 14-0 at home this season and had out-of-
conference victories against Boston College and the University
of Colorado.  Amaker, who played for  Mike Krzyzewski  at Duke University
before becoming a Blue Devils assistant coach, is 89-58 at
Harvard. He was 68-55 at Seton Hall University and 109-83 at the
University of Michigan before joining the Crimson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
