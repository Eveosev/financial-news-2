A giant pearl and a 19th-century
portrait of an Arab cleric are among highlights of $17 million
auctions in Dubai that will test demand for Middle Eastern art.  “After Prayers,” a 19th-century  painting  by Austrian
Rudolf Ernst of an elderly man leaning on his Nubian aide at a
mosque, may fetch as much as $600,000 at Bonhams today. A  pearl 
weighing almost 60 carats is estimated to sell for as much as
$250,000 at Christie’s International on April 20 as part of a
two-day sale of art and jewelry in the  Persian Gulf  sheikhdom
known for its pearl-diving history.  Dealers are watching prices after part of a 16th-century
Persian manuscript sold in  London  for 7.4 million pounds ($12
million) this month, an auction record for any Islamic work.  “We’re seeing a more stable market,” Guy Vesey, Middle
East director for Bonhams, said in an interview. “2006-2008 was
a boom globally, and the auction market followed that boom.”  Bonhams Orientalist art auction, estimated to raise $4.8
million, includes “ The Celebration ” by Jan Baptist Huysmans, a
painting of Arab men dressed in djellabas drinking Champagne,
that may get as much as $500,000, and “ Promenade in a Street in
India ” by Edwin Lord Weeks, estimated at as much as $400,000.  Christie’s will hold a modern and contemporary-art auction
on April 19, offering 120 lots with a total value of about $6
million. Contemporary art includes four lots from Iranian Farhad
Moshiri and Lebanese artists  Aymaan Baalbaki  and Nabil Nehas.
The modern section offers  Egypt ’s Abdul Hadi el-Gazzar’s
“ Fishing ,” valued at as much as $350,000.  Tanavoli Record  A sculpture by Parviz Tanavoli of  Iran  entitled “ The Wall
and the Birds ” is estimated at $120,000 to $180,000. In April
2008, as oil traded at about $120 a barrel, Tanavoli’s “The
Wall (Oh Persepolis)” set an auction record for a Middle
Eastern artist by fetching $2.84 million at Christie’s Dubai.  Christie’s jewelry sale is also estimated to raise as much
as $6 million and will feature a diamond and fancy-colored  set 
that may sell for as much as $550,000.  “People are more selective,” Michael Jeha, managing
director of Christie’s Middle East, said in an interview.
“Speculators have exited and we’re seeing the return of
traditional collectors previously priced out of the market.”  Oil prices  have rebounded to levels last seen in 2008, at
the height of the economic boom, when art sold at several times
the estimated price. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar are
leading the Persian Gulf in building museums to boost tourism
and end dependence on income from oil and gas exports.  Bonhams Photographs and Orientalist Art auction takes place
today. Information:  http://www.bonhams.com/uae/auction/18633/   Christie’s modern and contemporary Arab, Iranian and
