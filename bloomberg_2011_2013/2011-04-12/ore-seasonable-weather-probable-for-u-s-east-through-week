Seasonable weather will return to
the U.S. east of the  Mississippi River  through the rest of the
week before cooling reaches the upper Great Plains, according to
 Matt Rogers , president of  Commodity Weather Group LLC .  The outlook for April 17 to April 26 calls for a high
probability of cooler-than-normal weather across the northern
U.S. stretching east as far as the Great Lakes, according to the
Bethesda, Maryland-based forecaster. The Southwest will probably
be warmer than normal through April 26 and that trend will
spread to the South starting about April 22.  Natural gas traders monitor weather forecasts to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for the potential impact on
planting and crop yields.  New York â€™s average temperature in mid-to-late April is
about 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degrees Celsius), according to
 Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA EarthSat Weather . The average
temperature in  St. Louis  is about 58 degrees; in Boston, 50; in
Philadelphia, 55; in Atlanta, 62; and in Dallas, 66, according
to MDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
