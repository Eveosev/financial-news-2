A United Nations court set up to
prosecute suspects in the 1994 Rwandan genocide will start on
May 16 examining evidence against two of the tribunal’s most-
wanted men, said Rwandan Justice Minister Tharcisse Karugarama.  The Arusha, Tanzania-based court will begin examining
evidence against Felicien Kabuga and Protais Mpiranya who have
both evaded arrest, Karugarama told reporters in Kigali today.  Kabuga was indicted by the UN’s International Criminal
Tribunal for  Rwanda  in 1997, and is accused of providing
financial support for the genocide that saw about 800,000 ethnic
Tutsi and moderate Hutus killed in about 100 days.  Mpiranya, also one of the tribunal’s most wanted, was
indicted in 2002 and stands accused of “participating in the
planning, preparation and execution of a plan to exterminate the
Tutsi population of Rwanda,” according to the  court’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
