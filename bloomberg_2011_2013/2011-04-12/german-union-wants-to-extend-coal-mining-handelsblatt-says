The German IG BCE union for the
chemical, mining and energy industries wants hard-coal mines to
continue operating after government subsidies end in 2018,
 Handelsblatt said , citing a union strategy paper.  Power from renewable sources is still too volatile and coal
is needed to bridge the gap until the technology to store large
amounts of electricity is available, the union said, according
to the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
