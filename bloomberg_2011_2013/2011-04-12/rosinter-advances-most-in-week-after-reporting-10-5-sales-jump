OAO Rosinter Restaurants Holding
jumped the most in almost a week after the Moscow-based
restaurant chain said net operating revenue climbed by 10.5
percent in ruble terms in the first quarter as newly opened
restaurants boosted sales.  The stock surged as much as 4.2 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since April 6, and last traded 1 percent higher at
620 rubles by 4:19 p.m. in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
