BP Plc (BP/)  restarted a hydrocracker at
its Carson refinery in California after planned work, according
to a person with knowledge of the maintenance.  The unit was shut in early March for the work, according to
the person. Hydrocrackers convert heavy hydrocarbons into
lighter fuels such as high-octane gasoline or high grade fuel
oil through the catalytic addition of hydrogen.  The refinery has a capacity of 266,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
