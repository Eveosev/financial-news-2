University of Miami  officials flew
to  Boston  yesterday to try to convince Harvard University men’s
basketball coach Tommy Amaker to take the Hurricanes’ vacant
position, the Miami Herald reported.  The newspaper said it got the information from people with
knowledge of Miami’s coaching search. Miami is seeking a
replacement for Frank Haith, who left last week for the
University of Missouri.  In four seasons under Amaker, 45, Harvard has improved to
23-7 from 8-22. The Crimson were co-Ivy League conference
champions with Princeton University this past season.  Amaker, who played for Mike Krzyzewski at Duke University
and then was an assistant for the Blue Devils, was 68-55 at
Seton Hall University and 109-83 at the University of Michigan
before taking the Harvard job.  To contact the reporter on this story:
