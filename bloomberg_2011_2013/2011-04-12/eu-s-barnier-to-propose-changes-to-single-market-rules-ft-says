Michel Barnier , the European
Union’s internal market commissioner, will tomorrow present the
“single-market act,” containing proposals for new rules to
govern the 27-state bloc’s internal market, the Financial Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  He will also introduce legislation to create a single
European Union patent, possibly going into force before the end
of the year, the newspaper said without citing anyone,  The new rules cover 12 areas, including public procurement,
taxation and intellectual property, which were identified by the
EU as being important to facilitating easier cross-border
business, consumption and employment, and could be implemented
by the end of 2012, the Financial Times said, without
attribution.  The proposed taxation plans may include the introduction of
a common consolidated corporate tax base, which Ireland has
opposed, the Financial Times said, without citing anyone.  The proposed legislation must win the approval of a
qualified majority of member states and the backing of the
European Parliament before becoming law, which could take place
before the end of the year, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
