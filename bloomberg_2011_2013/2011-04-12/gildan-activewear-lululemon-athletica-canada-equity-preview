Canadian stocks fell, completing
the biggest two-day plunge since June, as commodity producers
dropped after two more earthquakes hit  Japan  and the Asian
country raised the severity rating of its nuclear disaster.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s biggest oil and gas producer,
lost 3.4 percent as crude futures slipped.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,
the country’s biggest base-metals and coal producer, declined
3.6 percent as copper retreated the most in a month. Toronto-
Dominion Bank, Canada’s second-largest lender by assets,
decreased 2 percent as an index of S&P/TSX financial companies
slipped to a three-week low.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index dropped 195.46
points, or 1.4 percent, to 13,801.40.  “The aftershocks that Japan is getting and the fact
they’re now saying this is a Chernobyl-like situation is being
badly received by the markets,” said Doug Davis, vice chairman
of Toronto money manager Davis-Rea Ltd., which manages about
C$425 million ($441 million). “People are selling indexes, and
that affects all the stocks.”  The S&P/TSX fell 1.5 percent yesterday after the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its growth estimate for the U.S.
The index has trailed the  S&P 500  this year, gaining 2.7 percent
to the U.S. stock benchmark’s 4.5 percent, after outperforming
the S&P 500 for seven straight years.  Quake Damage  Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency raised the
severity rating of the country’s nuclear crisis to 7 today, the
same as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, from 5. The change came as
two earthquakes stronger than magnitude 6 hit the country and
Kaoru Yosano, the economic and fiscal policy minister, said the
March 11 quake might hurt Japan’s economy more than forecast.  Oil declined 3.3 percent after losing 2.5 percent
yesterday. The two-day slide was the biggest since May. Fifty-
eight of 61 companies in the S&P/TSX Energy Index dropped as the
index slid the most in a day since August.  Suncor decreased 3.4 percent to C$42.05.  Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-biggest energy company by
market value, retreated 2.7 percent to C$44.34.  Talisman Energy
Inc. (TLM) , which produces oil and gas in  North America , the  North Sea 
and  Indonesia , fell 3.1 percent to C$22.33.  All major base metals traded on the London Metal Exchange
dropped.  Teck, First Quantum  Teck declined for a fifth day, losing 3.6 percent to
C$51.87.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest
publicly traded copper producer, decreased 4.7 percent to
C$124.90.  Mercator Minerals Ltd. (ML) , which produces copper and
molybdenum in  Arizona , slumped 8.9 percent to C$3.36 after
agreeing to buy Creston Moly Corp. for about C$195 million.  Precious-metals producers fell as gold futures dropped for
a second day after climbing to a record.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , Canada’s third-largest producer of the
metal, declined 1.8 percent to C$15.09. Silver reseller  Silver
Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  lost 3.2 percent to C$40.84 as that metal
retreated for the first time in seven days.  First Majestic
Silver Corp. (FR) , which mines in  Mexico , tumbled 8.6 percent to
C$19.77 after sliding 8.1 percent yesterday.  Uranium-mining companies slipped after Japan boosted the
severity rating of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant
accident.  Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , a mining company controlled by Moscow-
based ARMZ Uranium Holding, sank 5.1 percent to C$3.75.  Denison
Mines Corp. (DML)  plunged 6.9 percent to a five-month low of C$2.16.  Banks  Canada’s seven largest banks all fell. TD declined 2
percent, the most this year, to C$82.67.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,
Canada’s third-largest bank, slipped for a sixth day, losing 0.9
percent to C$57.50.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , North America’s
fourth-biggest insurer, dropped 1.4 percent to C$16.46.  Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL) , Canada’s largest clothing maker,
surged 7 percent, the most in 16 months, to C$32.80 after
agreeing to buy Newton, North Carolina-based sock supplier Gold
Toe Moretz Holdings Corp. for about $350 million.  Claude Proulx, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, raised his
12-month share-price estimate on Gildan’s U.S. shares to $40
from $36. The purchase will “allow the company to expand into
retail channels it is not currently serving,” he wrote in a
note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
