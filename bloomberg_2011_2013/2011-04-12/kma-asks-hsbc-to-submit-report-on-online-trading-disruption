The  Hong Kong Monetary Authority 
requested  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  to submit a report on a temporary
disruption to the bank’s online-trading system yesterday, the
city’s de facto central bank said in an e-mailed statement.  HKMA also asked HSBC to undertake the necessary measures
to prevent similar incidents, it said today.  Some overnight share orders placed at HSBC in Hong Kong
yesterday were “not carried out normally” because of
technical faults in the bank’s computer system, according to
an e-mailed statement from HSBC.  “We have been contacting customers who were directly
affected to apologize to them,” said Francesca McDonagh,
HSBC’s head of personal financial services in Hong Kong.  The bank will compensate in cases where a loss was
incurred, according to the HSBC statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
