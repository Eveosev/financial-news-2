Motiva Enterprises LLC’s Convent
Refinery in  Louisiana  released 500 pounds of sulfur dioxide from
three flare stacks because of an imbalance in the fuel gas
system, according to a  filing  with the National Response Center.  U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Motiva is a refining and marketing joint venture of Saudi
Refining Inc., a subsidiary of  Saudi Aramco , and Shell Oil Co.,
a unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   A message left on Shell’s media line wasn’t immediately
returned.  The Convent refinery can process 255,000 barrels of crude a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
