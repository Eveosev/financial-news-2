Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX) 
are due for a pullback, suggesting the two largest U.S. energy
companies may turn from leaders into a “soft patch” in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, said Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.  Exxon, the stock with the highest market value in the
world, produced a “negative divergence,” failing to keep up
with the rally in  oil prices  and surpass February highs.
Chevron, the third-biggest U.S. company after Exxon and Apple
Inc., rose to highest level relative to its 30-week moving
average since July 2007, a sign that the stock may be poised to
drop, said Dan Wantrobski, the director of technical research at
Janney.  Chevron “is in a vulnerable position,” Wantrobski said in
an interview from his office in Philadelphia. “If this comes in
and Exxon doesn’t recover, it could weigh on the S&P 500.”  Energy shares have performed the best among 10 industry
groups in the S&P 500 this year as anti-government protests
erupted in the Middle East and northern  Africa , pushing crude-
oil prices to a 30-month high. The S&P 500 Energy index rallied
15 percent, compared with a 5.3 percent gain in the benchmark
gauge. Exxon and Chevron together have a 5.3 percent weighting
in the S&P 500, so a pause by them would hold back any gains in
the benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks.  Exxon’s advance since March 16 stalled at an intraday level
of $86.22 last week, short of exceeding its Feb. 23 intraday
high of $88.23. That marks a “lower high” that tends to signal
a downtrend, Wantrobski said.  Shares of Chevron climbed to a closing level of $109.66 at
the end of last week, 21 percent above their average price over
the past 30 weeks, according to Janney and Bloomberg data. The
last time the stock posted a bigger gap -- July 13, 2007 -- the
shares fell 9.6 percent through Aug. 15.  “That’s a sign of potential exhaustion,” Wantrobski said.
“It’s going to trap somebody.”  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
