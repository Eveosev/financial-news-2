Oil traded near a two-week low in
 New York  because of concern demand may slow after the
 International Energy Agency  said prices above $100 a barrel are
starting to hurt the economy, and as U.S. stockpiles increased.  Futures plunged 3.3 percent yesterday, capping the biggest
two-day drop in almost 11 months, after the IEA reported signs
of an oil-demand slowdown and as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
forecast a “substantial” correction. U.S. crude stockpiles
rose 1.19 million barrels to 355.5 million last week, according
to the  American Petroleum Institute . Libyan rebels said Muammar Qaddafi’s forces are accelerating attacks on Misrata.  “If the world in itself is not growing, then why should we
have extra demand for crude? This is what people are starting to
think about at the moment,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing
director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney. “Growth
concerns are wiping out that Middle Eastern premium. There’s
more sellers than buyers.”  Crude oil for May delivery traded at $106.23 a barrel, down
2 cents, on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:20 p.m. Sydney

barrel to U.S. futures yesterday. The difference between front-
month contracts in  London  and New York surged to a record $19.54
on Feb. 21 as unrest spread in the Middle East and North Africa
and stockpiles climbed at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for New York futures. The spread averaged 76 cents last year.  The IEA said worldwide oil demand will rise by 1.4 million
barrels, or 1.6 percent, this year to average 89.4 million a
day. The forecast was unchanged from March.  The U.S. increased its crude-oil price forecast for 2011 to
an average $106.38 a barrel from $101.77 last month, according

million barrels a day.  An Energy Department report today may show supplies
increased 1 million barrels, according to 16 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News. Gasoline stockpiles may decline 1 million
barrels from 216.7 million barrels, the survey shows.  The U.S., the world’s largest economy, will expand 2.8

percent growth rate for 2011 forecast in January, the IMF said
April 11. It cut  Japan ’s 2011 growth forecast to 1.4 percent
from 1.6 percent in a January forecast.  Libya ’s main opposition leadership, the Interim
Transitional National Council, called for the  United Nations  to
declare Misrata an “internationally protected zone” and urged
the use of “all necessary measures” to prevent “a massacre of
men, women and children.”  The Libyan conflict is the bloodiest in a wave of uprisings
that has toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia and spread to
Algeria, Bahrain,  Iran , Oman, Syria and Yemen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
