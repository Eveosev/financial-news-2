Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s biggest oil
and gas producer, is considering selling part of its 28.5
percent stake in the Norwegian gas-pipeline network Gassled to
free up capital, Chief Executive Officer Helge Lund said.  Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to  sell  its 9.43 percent stake in
the network to Njord Gas Infrastructure AS last year for an
undisclosed sum. Lund said the timing of a potential sale had
not been determined.  “We’re looking into a possible reduction of our stake,”
Lund said today in an interview in Bergen, Norway. “The main
reason for this is that we believe we can use the capital
better, for our industrial operations, and for long-term value-
creation for our shareholders.”  Kirsten Smart, a  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  spokeswoman in
London, declined immediately to comment on whether the company
would sell its stake.  Total SA (FP) ’s Director of External Affairs in
Norway Bjoern Arne Naesgaard also declined to comment on the
phone from Oslo. Shell owns a 5 percent stake in Gassled, while
Total holds 6.1 percent, according to Gassled’s  website .  Gassled, a joint venture created in 2003 between oil and
gas companies operating on the Norwegian continental shelf, owns
Norway’s gas transport infrastructure. Norway is the world’s
second-biggest gas exporter.  Eni SpA (ENI) , Dong Energy A/S and ConocoPhillips are also
stakeholders in Gassled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
