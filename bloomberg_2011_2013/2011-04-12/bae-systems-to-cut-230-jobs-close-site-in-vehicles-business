BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , Europe’s biggest
defense company, said it will cut 230 jobs at its vehicle
business and close a factory in the U.K.  The company will cut about 70 jobs and close a site at
Wolverhampton,  England , and some work will be transferred to a
plant at Telford, spokesman Mike Sweeney said. Another 160 jobs
will be cut at other sites. The vehicle business employs about
700 people in the U.K. London-based BAE employs about 98,200
people worldwide, according to its 2010 annual report.  BAE completed a prior restructuring at the vehicle business
in 2009, when it cut about 590 jobs and closed three plants in
response to the British government’s delay in purchasing armored
vehicles. The U.K. named General Dynamics U.K. as the preferred
bidder for its specialist armored-vehicle contract the following
year.  “It shows again that defence cuts are hitting the private
sector,” Tony Hammond, a negotiator for labor union Prospect,
said in an e-mailed statement. “The loss of valuable skills is
a great concern to Prospect and is yet another blow to the
U.K.’s defense infrastructure.”  The U.K. business will now focus on supporting U.K. army
vehicles, Sweeney said. The move is “about becoming more
efficient,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
