Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is helping
 Ghana ’s state-owned oil company raise $500 million to fund
infrastructure and the purchases of crude oil for the country’s
Tema Oil Refinery, said Mike Muller, Shell’s global leader in
charge of crude trading.  The transaction will be completed this year and  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  is acting as lead arranger, Muller said at a conference
in Ghana’s capital, Accra, today.  Ghana National Petroleum Corp. will repay the loan with
crude shipments to Shell from its offshore Jubilee field, he
said. Shell’s role as a guarantor to the Ghanaian company in the
transaction requires that it gets the oil shipments and then
make sales in order to repay the banks, he said. “The shipment
can be in 2012 or beyond.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
