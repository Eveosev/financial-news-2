Canadian natural gas prices were
little changed as the nation’s currency weakened against the
U.S. dollar, making Canadian imports cheaper relative to
domestic gas, and equities fell, indicating demand may drop.  Gas was steady as the Canadian dollar weakened from almost
a 40-month high against its U.S. counterpart after  Canada ’s
central bank held its target rate for overnight loans at 1
percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined. The loonie
weakened 0.8 percent to 96.46 cents per U.S. dollar at 10:48
a.m. in Toronto.  “If it wasn’t for the stock markets and the crash in the
 oil prices , there would be a big move to the upside in gas,”
said Peter Linder, an energy analyst and investment manager at
DeltaOne Capital Partners in Calgary.  Natural gas from May delivery rose 1 cent to C$3.32 per
gigajoule ($3.26 per million British thermal units) as of 11
a.m. on  NGX , a Calgary-based exchange. In U.S. dollars per
million Btu, gas was down 2 cents from yesterday’s close
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of Canada’s gas is
exported to the U.S.  U.S. gas prices slipped as stock markets and crude oil
declined as  Japan  was hit by two earthquakes today and the
government raised the severity level of its nuclear crisis to
match the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The  S&P 500  dropped 0.9
percent as of 12:17 p.m. in  New York .  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was down 3 cents to $4.078 per million Btu.  Gas Flow  Volume on  TransCanada Corp.’s   Alberta  system, which
collects the output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.5
billion cubic feet as of 10:30 a.m. in New York, about 189
million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3.08 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.52 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 549 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.96 billion cubic feet today, about 78 percent of its
capacity of 2.5 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.04
billion cubic feet at 10:20 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
