Portugal ’s Social Democrats, the
biggest opposition party, led the ruling Socialist Party of
Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates by a narrower margin in

the  Social Democratic Party  led by Pedro Passos Coelho, 3.5
percentage points lower than in a March 27 survey, TVI said. The

percentage point more than in last month’s poll, according to
TVI. Portugal will hold elections on June 5.  The survey published today was carried out by Intercampus
