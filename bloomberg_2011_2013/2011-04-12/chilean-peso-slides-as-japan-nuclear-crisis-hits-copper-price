Chile ’s peso weakened as copper
fell after earthquakes deepened the nuclear emergency in  Japan ,
the second-largest customer for Chile’s copper.  The peso slid 0.3 percent to 473.63 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:50
a.m. New York time from 472.01 yesterday.  Stocks, led by emerging markets, fell the most in a month
and commodities retreated after two earthquakes struck Japan and
the government raised the severity level of its nuclear crisis
to the highest, matching the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The peso
is sliding even as 20 of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast a half-percentage point interest-rate increase today.  “The fear around Japan means that our star export falls
immediately and market risk increases,” said  Osvaldo Cruz , an
economist at Banco de Credito & Inversiones in Santiago.  Chile’s central bank has already raised its benchmark
interest rate 3.5 percentage points in the past year, more than
any other major rate-setter tracked by Bloomberg. It may raise
the rate again today after inflation expectations climbed along
with commodity prices and after the bank said on Jan. 3 it would
start buying $12 billion of U.S. currency to weaken the peso.  The MSCI World Index declined 0.8 percent to 1,337.88 as of
9:51 a.m., the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index
rose 6.5 percent. Copper for May delivery fell as much as 2
percent to $4.375 a pound. Chile is the world’s biggest copper-
producing nation.  Foreign investors in the Chilean forwards market had a $1.8
billion bet that the peso would fall against the dollar on April
8, according to the latest central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
