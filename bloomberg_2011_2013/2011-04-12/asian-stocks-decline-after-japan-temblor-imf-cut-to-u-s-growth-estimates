Asian stocks fell the most in
almost a month after the  International Monetary Fund  yesterday
cut its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. and  Japan , where
the government said problems at a stricken nuclear plant are
worse than previously stated.  Honda Motor Co., Japan’s No. 2 carmaker by market value,
lost 1.4 percent, leading Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
toward its steepest decline since markets tumbled in the
aftermath of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Tohoku
Electric Power Co. fell 3.7 percent after a series of plus 6-
magnitude aftershocks that have hit Japan in the past 24 hours.
In Sydney,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
dropped 1.3 percent after crude oil and copper prices declined.
 Cnooc Ltd. (883) , a Chinese offshore oil producer, lost 2.9 percent in
 Hong Kong .  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index declined 1.5 percent, the most
since March 15, to 134.56 as of 7:37 p.m. in  Tokyo .  “Investor sentiment is deteriorating because it seems
uncertainty is going to remain for a long period of time,” Ikuo Mitsui, who helps manage $270 million at Vivace Capital
Management Co. “There’s concern about how disruptions to
Japan’s supply chain will affect the global economy. Higher
gasoline prices mean a significant pressure on the U.S.
consumption, so the impact of  oil prices  on the global economy
is significant.”  About eight stocks fell for each that rose in the MSCI
Asia-Pacific index. The gauge has risen for three straight weeks
as Japanese companies resumed production after last month’s
earthquake, and as an improving  U.S. economy  bolstered optimism
the global recovery can be sustained.  Regional Benchmarks Slump  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.7 percent, the most
since March 15. As well as the 6.6 temblor yesterday, a
magnitude-6.3 earthquake struck Chiba, the prefecture east of
Tokyo, this morning and a magnitude 6.3 aftershock struck
Fukushima prefecture this afternoon, according to the Japan
weather agency. Also, Japan raised the severity rating of its
nuclear crisis to the highest level, matching the rating of the
1986 Chernobyl disaster, as increasing radiation prompts the
government to widen the evacuation zone.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 1.5 percent and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped 0.3 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
index retreated 1.6 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
sank 1.3 percent, the biggest drop since March 17.  China ’s
Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index declined 0.1 percent and
Taiwan’s Taiex index slumped 1.7 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.5 percent
today. In  New York  yesterday, the  S&P 500  dropped 0.3 percent
after oil dropped from a 30-month high as the International
Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for the world’s largest
economy.  IMF Forecasts  In Tokyo, Honda declined 1.4 percent to 2,862 yen.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, lost 0.6 percent to
3,240 yen. Sony Corp., Japan’s largest exporter of consumer
electronics, retreated 2.9 percent to 2,502 yen.  In Sydney,  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , the largest seller
of home siding in the U.S., fell 2.6 percent to A$5.74. In Seoul,
Samsung Electronics Co., which receives 20 percent of its
revenue from America, lost 1.3 percent to 882,000 won.  The U.S. economy will expand 2.8 percent this year, slowing
from 2.9 percent last year and less than the 3 percent growth
for 2011 forecast in January, the IMF said. The Washington-based
fund also cut its estimate of Japan’s growth to 1.4 percent from
1.6 percent in the previous forecast after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami.  Aftershocks Hit Japan  Tohoku Electric lost 3.7 percent to 1,358 yen. The utility
yesterday said about 220,000 homes, mostly in Iwaki city, were
without power.  Softbank Corp. (9984) , Japan’s third-biggest wireless
carrier, slipped 1.9 percent to 3,320 yen, biggest drag on the
Nikkei 225. Fast Retailing Co., Asia’s biggest clothing chain,
declined 1.3 percent to 11,740 yen.  Japan has been hit by a series of major aftershocks in the
past 24 hours, a month after the record quake that triggered a
tsunami on March 11, leaving 27,493 dead or missing and
disabling Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant. Japan’s nuclear safety agency today raised the severity
rating of the crisis at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant to
7, the highest level.  “After yesterday’s quake, investors are likely to wonder
whether there’s more to come,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “That’s
likely to weigh on sentiment.”  Estimated Earnings  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.3 percent by the S&P
500 and 1.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  BHP slumped 1.3 percent to A$48.89 in Sydney, the biggest
drag on the MSCI index. In Hong Kong, Cnooc fell 2.9 percent to
HK$19.86. PetroChina Co., the nation’s No. 1 oil producer, slid
4.9 percent to HK$11.74. The three stocks were the heaviest
drags on the MSCI measure.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest energy
explorer, retreated 5.2 percent to 620,000 yen, its steepest
decline since March 15.  Oil for May delivery tumbled from a 30-month high, dropping
2.5 percent to settle at $109.92 a barrel in New York yesterday,
the most since Nov. 17. Oil for May delivery fell as much as 1.9
percent to $107.87 today.  Unwinding Positions  Some traders may be “unwinding their positions to lock in
the profit in commodities and the stock markets,” said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer at KGI Asia Ltd.  Among other stocks that fell, Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.,
the nation’s largest producer of the metal, lost 1.8 percent to
HK$7.60. China’s Ministry of Finance is considering a reduction
of export rebates for some aluminum products to 9 percent from
13 percent, the China Securities Journal reported, without
citing anyone.  Alumina Ltd. (AWC) , partner in the world’s biggest producer of
the material used to make aluminum, dropped 6 percent to A$2.53
in Sydney, its steepest drop since January 29.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, said sales
increased 22 percent to $5.96 billion from $4.89 billion a year
earlier, missing the average estimate of $6.06 billion from
eight analysts in the Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
