China’s stocks will continue to
“trend upward” in the second quarter as bank shares benefit
from an expansion in net interest margins, Nomura Holdings Inc.
said in a report today.  The brokerage reiterated its yearend forecast of 16,000 for
the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index and its estimate of 83 for
the MSCI China Index, analyst Henry Wu wrote in the report. So-
called consumer staples will be “under pressure” as the
government seeks to restrain price increases, he wrote.  A possible slowdown in economic growth will be the “major
risk” for the stock market this quarter, according to the
report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
