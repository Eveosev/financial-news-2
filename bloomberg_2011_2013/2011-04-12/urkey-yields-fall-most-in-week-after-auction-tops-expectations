The yield on  Turkey ’s two-year
benchmark bonds dropped the most in more than a week after the
Treasury raised more than planned in auctions this month.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt fell 13 basis points,
0.13 percentage point, to 8.69 percent at the 5:00 p.m. close in
Istanbul, according to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index.  The Treasury raised 3.51 billion liras ($2.3 billion) in
the sale of bonds due February 2013, priced to yield an average
of 8.88 percent, down from 9.01 percent in the previous auction
of two-year bonds on March 8, according to its website. The
government also sold 2.06 billion liras of 10-year debt linked
to inflation and 1.59 billion liras of January 2014 bonds for a
total of 7.2 billion liras this month, more than its 7.1
billion-lira target.  “We are seeing foreign investor interest and people are
switching from the old benchmark” to the new benchmark two-year
note as “everyone thinks that the new benchmark will be more
liquid,” Murat Yardimci, head of trading at ING Bank AS in
Istanbul, said by telephone. Investors who failed to fulfill
their orders in the auction snapped up bonds in the secondary
 debt market , Yardimci said.  The lira depreciated 0.1 percent to 1.5178 per dollar. The
 ISE National 100 index (XU100)  fell 0.3 percent to 68,006.89.  To contact the reporter on this story:
