The Arsenal Supporters Trust, a
shareholder group for the north London soccer team’s fans, won’t
sell its stake in the club.  About 100 members met after yesterday’s announcement that
Denver Nuggets owner Stan Kroenke would increase his stake in
Arsenal to nearly 63 percent, which requires him to make an
offer to all investors. The trust voted to keep its holding.  “Arsenal is too important to be owned by any one person,”
the group said on its website. “The AST wants to work with Stan
Kroenke to keep Arsenal supporters involved in the club’s
ownership structure.”  Arsenal Fanshare program has 1,800 members who have
invested 500,000 pounds ($816,000) in the team’s stock, the AST
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
