Russia  may raise the export duty on
most crude oil shipments by as much as 7.6 percent on May 1
after Urals prices climbed to the highest level since the 2008
financial crisis.  The standard  tax rate  will probably be in the range of
$453.40 (about $62 a barrel) to $456 a metric ton, up from $423.70 
a ton in April, according to Bloomberg calculations based on 
Finance Ministry data. The discounted rate on oil pumped via 
Russia’s East Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline to  Asia  and from 
the  Caspian Sea  may reach $211.60 to $213.30 a ton, from $191.  Russia sets the duty based on the average Urals price from
the 15th day of one month to the 14th day of the next. Urals,
Russia’s benchmark export blend, will probably average $114.42
to $114.95 during this monitoring period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said today by phone.  Brent and Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, have
traded at an average above $100 a barrel in the past two months,
the first time since August 2008 as unrest in northern  Africa 
and the Middle East disrupted some oil flows.  The export tax on light oil products may rise to a range of
$303.80 to $305.50 a ton from $283.90. The duty on heavy
products may be within $211.70 to $212.90 a ton, compared with
$197.90. The government changed the calculation for oil-product
taxes to a percentage of the crude levy as it gradually closes
the gap between them.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign off on the duties
for them to come into effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
