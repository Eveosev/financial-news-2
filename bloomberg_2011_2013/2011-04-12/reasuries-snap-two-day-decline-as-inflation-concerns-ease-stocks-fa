Treasuries snapped a two-day slide
after Federal Reserve officials  William Dudley  and Janet Yellen
said the economy isn’t strong enough to ease stimulus.  Demand for the relative safety of government debt increased
after an earthquake in  Japan  triggered a decline in Asian stocks.
The Treasury is scheduled to sell $32 billion of 3-year notes
today, $21 billion of 10-year debt tomorrow and $13 billion of
30-year bonds on April 14.  “Fed members are trying to control inflation
expectations,” said Kei Katayama, who helps oversees the
equivalent of $54 billion as leader of the foreign fixed-income
group in Tokyo at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. “There’s a
possibility that yields may fall.”  Ten-year rates were little changed at 3.57 percent as of
10:53 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The 3.625 percent note due in February 2021 traded at 100 13/32.
Yields climbed almost four basis points in the past two days.  New York  Fed President Dudley said yesterday the central
bank shouldn’t be overly enthusiastic about removing the record
stimulus it is providing for the economy. The Fed is buying $600
billion in Treasuries through June and has held its benchmark
interest rate at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to
support growth.  “We’re probably going to have excess slack in the U.S.
labor market at least through the end of 2012,” Dudley told a
forum in Tokyo.  The  unemployment rate  last month was 8.8 percent, the Labor
Department reported on April 1.  Temporary Effect  Fed Vice Chairman Yellen said increases in commodities will
have only a temporary effect on inflation and don’t warrant a
reversal of stimulus. The  U.S. economy  doesn’t seem to be
experiencing the kind of “sharp rebound” that usually follows
a deep recession, she said in a speech in New York.  The Labor Department will report April 15 that its  consumer
price index  rose 0.5 percent last month from February and was up
2.6 percent from March 2010, according to Bloomberg News surveys.
Core prices, which exclude volatile food and fuel, rose 0.2
percent for a third consecutive month, the survey showed.  A magnitude-6.2 earthquake struck Chiba, the prefecture
east of Tokyo, today, swaying buildings in the capital city. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares fell 1.1 percent, the most in
four weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
