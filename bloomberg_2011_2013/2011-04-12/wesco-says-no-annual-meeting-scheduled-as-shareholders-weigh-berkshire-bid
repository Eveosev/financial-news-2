Wesco Financial Corp. (WSC)  said it has
no plans to hold an annual meeting as it seeks to complete a
deal that would give Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) 
100 percent ownership of the company.  “At this time, no annual meeting for 2011 has been
scheduled because of the pending proposal to merge Wesco with
and into a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway,” the Pasadena,
California-based company said today in a statement distributed
by  Business Wire .  Wesco has operated for more than two decades as a majority-
owned unit of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire. The company,
which is led by Berkshire Vice Chairman Charles Munger and is
80.1 percent-owned by Buffett’s firm, said in February it
accepted a deal of about $550 million for the remaining stake
and would seek shareholder approval.  Berkshire took  majority control  of Wesco in 1983 and
transformed the company from a California lender into a unit
that stores steel, rents furniture and sells insurance to banks
and airlines. Wesco said in a Feb. 7 filing that Munger may hold
an “Afternoon with Charlie” question-and-answer session on May
4 in lieu of an annual meeting, depending on the timing of the
transaction’s completion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
