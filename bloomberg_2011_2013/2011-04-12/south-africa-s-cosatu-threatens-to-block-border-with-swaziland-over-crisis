The Congress of South African Trade
Unions, the nation’s biggest labor federation, will block the
border with Swaziland, stopping trade, if there isn’t a move to
democracy in the southern African country.  The government in Swaziland,  South Africa ’s neighbor, must
unban all political parties, introduce multi-party democracy and
repeal laws preventing freedom of association and choice,
Johannesburg-based Cosatu said in an e-mailed statement today.  Cosatu members demonstrated at the border with Swaziland
today and supports planned protests in that country by labor
unions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
