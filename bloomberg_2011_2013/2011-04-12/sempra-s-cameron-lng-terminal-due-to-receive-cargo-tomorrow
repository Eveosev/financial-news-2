Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s Cameron liquefied
natural gas terminal in  Louisiana  is due to receive a cargo of
the fuel tomorrow, according to vessel tracking data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The tanker, LNG Gemini, can carry 126,750 cubic meters of
LNG, or 2.73 billion cubic feet when converted to a gas. The
cargo is equal to about 4.4 percent of daily U.S. gas
production.  The terminal gained government approval in January to
export previously imported LNG cargoes, according to Kathleen
Teora, a Sempra spokeswoman. Cheniere Energy Inc.’s Sabine Pass
terminal in Louisiana and Freeport LNG’s Freeport in  Texas  are
also authorized to re-export LNG.  LNG is gas that is cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gaseous form so it can
be piped to users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
