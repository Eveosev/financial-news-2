The following is the text of
the new house price index report for February released by
 Statistics Canada .  The New Housing Price Index (NHPI) rose 0.4% in
February, following a 0.2% advance in January.  Toronto and Oshawa as well as  Edmonton  were the top
contributors to the NHPI increase in February.  Between January and February, prices increased the most
in Regina (+1.8%) followed by Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo
(+1.7%), Charlottetown (+1.5%), and Edmonton (+1.1%).  In Regina, Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo and Edmonton,
the increases were primarily a result of higher land
development fees.  In Charlottetown, builders reported increased prices as
a result of improving market conditions.  Price decreases were recorded in Calgary (-0.4%),
Windsor (-0.3%), Ottawa-Gatineau (-0.2%) and Saint John,
Fredericton and Moncton (-0.1%).  In Calgary, builders offered promotional prices and
bonus upgrade packages in order to stimulate sales.  In Ottawa-Gatineau, builders recorded lower negotiated
selling prices in February.  Slower market conditions caused builders in Windsor as
well as in Saint John, Fredericton and Moncton to reduce
their prices.  Year over year, the NHPI was up 2.1% in February
following a 1.9% increase in January.  The main contributors to the year-over-year increase of
the NHPI in February were the metropolitan regions of
Toronto and Oshawa as well as  Montreal .  The largest year-over-year increase continued to be in
 St. John's  (+6.2%).  Compared with February 2010, contractors' selling
prices were also higher in Regina (+5.9%) and Winnipeg
(+4.6%).  Among the 21 metropolitan regions surveyed, 5
registered 12-month declines in February: Windsor (-4.0%),
Greater Sudbury and Thunder Bay (-1.4%), Victoria (-1.0%),
St. Catharine's-Niagara (-0.8%) and Vancouver (-0.2%).  To contact the reporter on this story:
