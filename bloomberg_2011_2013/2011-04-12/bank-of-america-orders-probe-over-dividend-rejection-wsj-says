Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  internal
auditors are investigating why two of the firm’s most senior
financial officers weren’t consulted over a decision to tell
investors that regulators had rejected a dividend increase, the
Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the
matter.  Chief Financial Officer Chuck Noski and Chief Accounting
Officer Neil Cotty weren’t told about a filing outlining the
rejection before it was sent to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and Kevin Stitt, head of  investor relations , only
found out hours before, the newspaper said.  The  SEC filing , in effect a public statement of the
regulator’s decision to block the proposed dividend, was
approved by Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan; the fact
that the two leading financial officers weren’t informed
highlights questions about corporate governance at the bank, the
WSJ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
