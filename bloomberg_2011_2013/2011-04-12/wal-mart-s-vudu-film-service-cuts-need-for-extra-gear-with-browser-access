Vudu , the Web-based film rental
business owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , began offering a
browser-based service that lets customers access movies without
having equipment such as a game console or Blu-ray player.  Customers can search for, select and stream movies and TV
shows from the Vudu.com site using a Web browser, the Santa
Clara, California-based Wal-Mart unit said in a statement today.  Vudu and other providers have been trying to gain market
share by emphasizing features not available on  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) ’s
$7.99 monthly service. Vudu offers a la carte downloads the same
day as DVDs or Blu-ray discs go into stores. It also emphasizes
high-definition films and stereo soundtracks.  Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings has stayed
away from the pay-per-view market, focusing on unlimited
offerings for a monthly fee.  Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, rose 70 cents to
$53.52 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, gained $5.76
to $233.29 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
