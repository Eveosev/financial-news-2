Alliance Trust Plc (ATST)  may switch to a
“one share, one vote” system for shareholders in order to
avoid accusations that it benefits from block voting, the
Financial Times reported, without saying where it got the
information. The 2.4 billion-pound ($3.9 billion)  investment
company  also faces pressure from shareholders to introduce a
formal agreement to buy back shares, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
