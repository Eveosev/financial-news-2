Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper sought to fend off attacks that he’s misspent public
funds and undermined the country’s finances with business tax
reductions during a televised debate among the leaders of
 Canada ’s four largest political parties Tuesday night.  Harper, 51, countered the criticism by saying the
opposition parties triggered unnecessary elections, adding the
tax cuts were approved by Parliament four years ago and their
reversal would undermine the nation’s economic outlook.  Harper was also asked about media articles that cited a
draft report by Auditor General Sheila Fraser, which said the
government misused funds hosting last year’s Group of Eight
nations leaders’ summit. Harper said all funds were fully
accounted for.  The debate, held in Ottawa, included Liberal Party Leader
 Michael Ignatieff , New Democratic Party Leader  Jack Layton  and
Bloc Quebecois Gilles Duceppe. A separate French-language debate
will be held tomorrow.  Polls suggest the Conservatives would win the most seats in
the election.  The Conservatives were supported by 39.7 percent of decided
voters, followed by 31.2 percent who supported the Liberals,
according to a CTV/Globe/Nanos election survey published today.
The telephone survey of 1,200 people was conducted April 10-12
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
