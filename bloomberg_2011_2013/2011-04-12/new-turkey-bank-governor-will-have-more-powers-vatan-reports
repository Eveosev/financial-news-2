Turkish Central Bank governor
Durmus Yilmaz will propose that his successor’s powers are
strengthened in order to speed up the bank’s decision-making
processes, Vatan reported.  Yilmaz will propose that the central bank’s executive
organs, including the Monetary Policy Committee and Executive
Committee, are allowed to make decisions such as setting reserve
requirement rates without the need for approval of the six-
member Board, the Istanbul-based newspaper said.  The new regulations will be presented to the bank’s general
assembly today, Vatan reported. The regulations also allow the
Treasury to make deposits in other banks.  Yilmaz is due to step down later this month. Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan  will nominate his successor to President
 Abdullah Gul .  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
