A surplus of supertankers to carry
Middle East oil is little changed amid a scarcity of cargoes.  There are 17 percent more very large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, for hire over the next 30 days than there are likely
cargoes, according to the median estimate of seven shipbrokers
and two owners surveyed by Bloomberg News today. That compares
with 18 percent on April 5.  “The long tonnage lists versus the projected remaining
cargoes for April indicate no near-to-mid-term rate increases,”
Dag Kilen, an Oslo-based analyst at RS Platou Markets, said in
an e-mailed note today.  Charter rates on the industry’s benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-
Japan route fell 0.6 percent yesterday to 54.53 Worldscale
points, for a 44 percent decline in the past 12 months,
according to data from the  Baltic Exchange  in  London . Daily
rental income from the route has declined 3.5 percent this month
to $7,235.  The current return is 77 percent less than the $31,100 that
Frontline Ltd., the world’s biggest VLCC operator, needs to
break even on the ships.  To contact the reporters on this story:
