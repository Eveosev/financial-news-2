Peru ’s sol fell the most in two
weeks after two more earthquakes hit Japan and the Asian country
raised the severity rating of its nuclear disaster, sparking a
slump global in equities.  The currency weakened 0.3 percent to 2.8095 per  U.S. dollar 
at 4:58 p.m. New York time, from 2.8025 yesterday.  The central bank contacted traders to gauge demand for sol-
indexed certificates of deposits, which it uses to stem declines
in the currency, but didn’t call an auction, said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco Santander , in an e-mailed note to
investors.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 rose 8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 6.73 percent, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
