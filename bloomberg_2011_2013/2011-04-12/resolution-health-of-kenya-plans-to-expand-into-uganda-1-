Resolution Health East Africa Ltd. ,
a Kenyan health insurer that plans to list on the stock
exchange, said it will start operating in neighboring  Uganda  in
the fourth quarter.  The company plans to grow its customer base by 30 percent
to 56,000 by the end of the year, Chief Executive Officer Peter
Nduati told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital.  “In Uganda we are going green field, we are starting from
zero,” Nduati said.  Frankfurt, Germany-based ADC African Development Corp., a
company with investments in sub-Saharan  Africa , bought 25.1
percent of Resolution for 184 million shillings on Jan. 13.
Resolution, which has operations in Tanzania, also plans to
start operations in  Rwanda  and  Southern Sudan , Nduati said on
Jan. 13.  The company will introduce new products to attract
additional customers and will target to increase the percentage
of its individual clients as a proportion of total customers to
37 percent by December from 27 percent at the end of last year,
he said.  “Usually you will not find individuals negotiating terms,
usually they pay higher end premiums,” he added.  Resolution’s net income increased to 208 million shillings
($2.5 million) in the year through December from 179.4 million
shillings a year earlier, Nduati said on March 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
