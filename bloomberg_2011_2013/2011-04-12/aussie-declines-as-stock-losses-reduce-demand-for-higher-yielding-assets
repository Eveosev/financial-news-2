against most of its major counterparts as a slide in Asian
stocks reduced demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie dropped to $1.0462 as of 10:32 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0496 yesterday in  New York . It lost 0.6 percent
to 88.29 yen.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
