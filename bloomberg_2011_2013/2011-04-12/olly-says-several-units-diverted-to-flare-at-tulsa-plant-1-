Holly Corp. (HOC) , an independent U.S.
refiner, flared gases from several units at one of its
refineries in Tulsa,  Oklahoma , after a boiler unit went into
“steam shedding mode,” said Neale Hickerson, a company
spokesman. He said the units are operating at normal rates.  “Our Tulsa refinery was tuning some instrumentation in our
boiler unit, which caused the boilers to go into a steam
shedding mode,” Hickerson, who is based at Holly’s Dallas
headquarters, said in an e-mail today. “This caused several
units to divert flow to our flare, creating a flare event.”  Hickerson didn’t immediately say which plant was affected.  Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed.  The Tulsa refinery, which comprises an east and a west
facility, can process about 125,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
