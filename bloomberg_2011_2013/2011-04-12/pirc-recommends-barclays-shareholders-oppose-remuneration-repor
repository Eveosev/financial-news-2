Barclays Plc (BARC)  shareholders should
vote against the bank’s executive pay report because it’s vague
and too complex, according to an  investment adviser .  “Disclosure of executive pay is opaque and design of
executive pay is overly complex,” Pensions & Investment
Research Consultants Ltd. said in a statement today. “This
prevents analysis of the design and quantum of executive pay.”  Barclays Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  was awarded
as much as 10.1 million pounds ($16.4 million) in salary,
bonuses and stock for 2010. The lender’s two highest paid
executives within its securities unit were paid as much as 28.3
million pounds, London-based Barclays said last month.  “We are particularly concerned about the choice of
performance targets which link incentives to prudent share
capital management,” said Pirc, which advises investors on
corporate governance. “This is not appropriate, particularly in
a regulated bank where regulatory requirements are being used to
justify incentive payments.” Clawbacks on bonuses only apply
when a dividend is not paid, PIRC said.  The bank is scheduled to hold its annual shareholder
meeting on April 27 in  London . A spokesman for Barclays declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
