Norway reclassified its ownership
in  Cermaq ASA (CEQ)  as a business holding, opening up more for a
possible sale of its stake, Dagens Naeringsliv reported, citing
Trade and Industry minister Trond Giske.  The fish farmer was lifted into category 1 from category 2,
increasing options for various “industrial solutions,” Giske
told the Oslo-based newspaper. Cermaq’s Chairman Baard Mikkelsen
recognizes that this could lead to greater freedom to find
industrial solutions, according to the newspaper.  The government owns 43.5 percent of Cermaq.  To contact the reporter on this story:
