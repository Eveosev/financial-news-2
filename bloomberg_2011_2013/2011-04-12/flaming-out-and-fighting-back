Next month I will be the proud recipient of two honors: the "Isabel Benham Award" (Women's Bond Club) and the "Woman of the Year Award" (Financial Women's Association). I'm more than usually appreciative. I've held high-profile jobs and delivered impressed results, but I know about banishment and lonely struggle. Like many working moms I've grappled with  a variety of road blocks and "off-ramps."  One of my off-ramps was voluntary; the others were forced on me by employers and the marketplace. In the 1980s I lost twins in the seventh month of pregnancy. This loss triggered a protracted struggle on the childbearing front, and it also torpedoed my promotional prospects. The timing was bad (as it often is). I was at the seven-year mark in my career as a college professor and I was turned down for tenure. To quote one of the conservative members of my tenure committee, I wasn't "sufficiently committed" and had allowed childbearing to "dilute my focus." As I packed up my office — having lost both my job and my babies — it struck me that the peak demand of many female careers, not just mine, clashed and collided in the worst way with the urgent demands of the biological clock. So many of us were trying to have children in our mid or late thirties, before it was too late, and running into all kinds of punishments and penalties. Despite the bitter disappointment of failing to get tenure, I landed a great job and went on to spend six exhilarating years as executive director of the Economic Policy Council, managing a debate across the political divide and testifying on the Hill on issues from immigration reform to LDC debt. But in my early 40s I hit a second wall. The pressures of my ever-expanding job were crowding out my small children. I was becoming an over-committed wife and mother. How could I help my five-year-old deal with separation anxiety when I needed to catch the 6:30 a.m. shuttle to Washington two out of his first three days in kindergarten? Something had to go. I tried to negotiate some flexibility, but my board was convinced that running an organization required a five-day-a-week, in-the-office commitment.  Reluctantly, I quit my job. I tried to focus on the positives. I did, after all, have options. I had a hugely supportive husband who earned a good living. I could build on the success of my last book and write from home — a work schedule much more compatible with the needs of small children. Still, I felt regret. I resigned the week of my 41st birthday, and as I moved out of my corner office I knew that this was the end of my on track "male" career. Even if I managed to become a successful writer, I would never again be seen as an up-and-comer. But I knew what I had to do. I went home, regrouped, and started a new career as an author and activist. I worked long but odd hours, traveled only rarely, and saw a great deal of my kids. My off-track career was moderately successful. In the 1990s, I wrote books about women, work, and public policy that earned me a living and gave me a voice in the national debate about how to better support America's working women. Then, in the early 2000s, I veered off course for a third time. My career was in trouble again, and this time it had nothing to do with recalcitrant employers or needy children. It was a market thing. My books were not selling. The crux of the problem was that they were infused with a liberal policy perspective that was increasingly unfashionable in a George W. America. I will always remember a meeting I had in September 2002 with my literary agent — a wonderful woman known for her business acumen and brutal honesty. "You're washed up," she told me, looking me straight in the eye. "It's time to find a day job — relying on books to provide a serious presence or a serious income is not something I would recommend." For a few weeks I felt sorry for myself. Then I went to work. Over the next year, I landed myself a high profile teaching position (at Princeton) to burnish my brand. I then took on corporate America, taking my knowledge base, skill set, and passionate commitment to women's progress and putting them to work in the private sector. Eighteen months later, I founded the Hidden Brain Drain Task Force, and while the rest is not quite history — with 63 global corporations now vested in this effort — it might well become so. Where did my self-reinvention energy come from? In concrete ways I was highly motivated. Four children and a husband newly working in the nonprofit sector served to focus the mind. And, as a woman on the "north" side of 50 I had a huge sense of urgency. Time was not on my side. Whatever shot I had at a late-life career was right now.  More profoundly, I was tremendously energized by the notion that this time around I really could make a difference. The tectonic shifts going on in the world meant that employers were newly receptive to my message and my solution sets. How glorious it would be to drive more generous and flexible choices for women! This could be the ultimate legacy: make a difference in the options facing my daughters and an entire new generation of young women.
