This year’s  Rugby World Cup  in  New
Zealand  may attract as many as 95,000 foreign visitors following
strong ticket sales to overseas markets, tournament organizer
Rugby New Zealand 2011 Ltd. said.  “At the moment, we’re picking about 85 to 95,000
visitors,” RNZ 2011 Chief Executive Officer Martin Snedden said
at a tournament briefing in Sydney today. “We started out
thinking it might be around 60 or 70,000, based on the Sydney
Olympics and Rugby World Cup in 2003, but the offshore sales
have been incredibly strong.”  Hosting the seventh edition of rugby’s four-yearly world
championship will add about NZ$700 million ($545 million), or
0.33 percent, to gross domestic product, Reserve Bank Governor
Alan Bollard said Jan. 28. Staging the event can boost the local
economy by as much as 1 billion pounds ($1.9 billion), according
to a Deloitte LLP study.  The 20-nation  World Cup  starts in 150 days, when New
Zealand’s top-ranked All Blacks face Tonga in the first of 48
matches. The final is scheduled Oct. 23 in Auckland.  The tournament offers New Zealand a rare chance to showcase
itself globally as a tourist destination, Snedden said.  “This is our Olympics, this is our soccer World Cup,”
Snedden said. “This is by far the biggest event that our
country has ever hosted and in the foreseeable future will host.
It is really, really important that we host it in the right
way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
