Emma Donoghue’s “Room” was tapped
as one of six finalists in the  Orange Prize for Fiction , whose
winner takes home 30,000 pounds ($48,900) and a bronze statuette
called “the Bessie.”  Created in 1996, the annual Orange Prize celebrates fiction
by women worldwide. In narrowing the field from a list of 20
books, the judges passed over Jennifer Egan’s “A Visit From the
Goon Squad” and Karen Russell’s “Swamplandia!”  In “Room” (Picador), Donoghue tells the horrifying story
of a 19-year-old college student abducted and held captive for
years in a secure chamber, like Elisabeth Fritzl of  Austria .  The other finalists for the prize are Aminatta Forna’s
“The Memory of Love” (Bloomsbury); Emma Henderson’s “Grace
Williams Says It Loud” (Sceptre); Nicole Krauss’s “Great
House” (Viking); Tea Obreht’s “The Tiger’s Wife” (Weidenfeld
& Nicolson); and Kathleen Winter’s “Annabel” (Cape).  The winner will be announced at a ceremony in the Royal
Festival Hall at  London ’s Southbank Centre on June 8.  Previous winners have included Barbara Kingsolver for “The
Lacuna,” Marilynne Robinson for “Home” and Rose Tremain for
“The Road Home.”  To contact the reporter on the story:
