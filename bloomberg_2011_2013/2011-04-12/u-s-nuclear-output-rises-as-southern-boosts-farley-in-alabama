U.S. nuclear-power output rose for
a second day as plants in Pennsylvania and  Alabama  boosted
energy production, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 1,085 megawatts from
yesterday to 77,054 megawatts, or 76 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-four of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Southern Co. (SO)  raised output from the 860-megawatt Farley 2
reactor to 100 percent of capacity from 56 percent yesterday.
Another unit at the site, the 851-megawatt Farley 1, is
operating at full power. The plant is located about 18 miles (29
kilometers east of Dothan, Alabama.  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  boosted the 940-megawatt Beaver Valley 2
reactor to 61 percent of capacity from 25 percent yesterday. The
plant is located about 26 miles northwest of Pittsburgh.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  increased output by the 1,025-megawatt Indian
Point Unit 3 to 97 percent of capacity from 86 percent
yesterday. The 1,020-megawatt Indian Point 2 reactor is
operating at full capacity. Unit 1 was shut in 1974. The plant
is located on the Hudson River about 27 miles north of  New York
City .  The  Tennessee Valley Authority  boosted output from the
1,104-megawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor in Alabama to 82 percent
of capacity from 68 percent yesterday.  TVA Reactors  Browns Ferry Units 1 and 3, which have respective
capacities of 1,065 megawatts and 1,115 megawatts, are operating
at full power. The plant is located 84 miles north of Birmingham
on Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee border.  FirstEnergy raised production at the 893-megawatt Davis-
Besse reactor to 100 percent of capacity from 91 percent
yesterday. The unit is located on Lake Erie 21 miles east of
Toledo,  Ohio .  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
