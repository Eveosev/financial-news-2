Codelco, the worldâ€™s biggest copper
producer, is considering closing a smelter at its Ventanas
complex in central  Chile  while continuing refinery operations,
Diario Financiero reported.  The proposal will be discussed at a board meeting in the
coming days, the Santiago-based newspaper quoted Chairman
Gerardo Jofre as saying. The smelter was temporarily halted by a
court last month because of gas emissions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
