Gerdau SA (GGBR4) , Latin America’s largest
steelmaker, and shareholders are raising as much as 5.5 billion
reais ($3.5 billion) in the region’s biggest stock sale in
almost seven months. The stock fell to a 21-month low.  Gerdau sold 68 million new common shares for 15.60 reais
each and 134.8 million new preferred shares for 19.25 reais
apiece, while existing investors sold 69 million preferred
shares, according to regulatory filings yesterday. The  Porto
Alegre , Brazil-based company may issue an additional 10.2
million common shares and 20.4 million preferred shares in a
supplementary offer.  The share sale is Latin America’s biggest since  Brazil ’s
state-run oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA raised $70 billion
in the world’s biggest offering in September. This year through
yesterday, 10 companies had sold shares in public offerings on
the  Sao Paulo  exchange for a combined $2.78 billion, 50 percent
less than this time last year.  “There are a lot of share offerings and in the medium term
this has to be corrected,” Leonardo Alves, an analyst at
brokerage Link Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone
interview today. Gerdau will likely rebound as it’s better
positioned than its rivals in the market for long steel used in
construction, he said.  Gerdau’s common stock dropped 0.8 percent to 15.48 reais in
Sao Paulo trading as of 4:05 p.m. New York time. The preferred
shares, the most commonly traded class of stock, fell 2.4
percent to 18.91 reais, bringing the total loss in the past 12
months to 39 percent. It’s the lowest close since July 14, 2009.  Brazil IPOs  Banco BTG Pactual SA, Banco Bradesco BBI SA and Banco Itau
BBA SA managed the sale.  Four of this year’s five initial public offerings in Brazil
were priced either at the bottom of initial estimates or below,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. QGEP Participacoes SA,
the  oil company  owned by Queiroz Galvao SA, was the biggest IPO
this year and sold shares at 19 reais each, 17 percent less than
the lowest estimate set by the banks arranging the offer.  Gerdau is selling shares amid speculation that it may buy
part of rival  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA (USIM5) , the
Brazilian steelmaker known as Usiminas.  “The market thinks that this money will be used for the
acquisition,” Leonardo Brito, an equity analyst at Rio de
Janeiro-based Teorica Investimentos, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “There is nothing clear yet.”  Usiminas Control  Nippon Steel Corp. said Feb. 18 it will retain control of
Usiminas together with local partners following speculation that
Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA, Brazil’s third-biggest steelmaker,
may challenge the group. Nippon, Votorantim Participacoes SA and
Camargo Correa SA together own 53.7 percent of Usiminas.  CSN said March 29 that it aims to reach a 10 percent stake
in Usiminas after adding shares between Jan. 26 and March 21 to
increase its holdings to 8.62 percent.  Gerdau said in a March 23 prospectus that it may sell as
many as 23.8 million common shares and 47.6 million preferred
shares in supplementary offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
