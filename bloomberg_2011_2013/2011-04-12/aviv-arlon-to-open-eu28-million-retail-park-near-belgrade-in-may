Tel Aviv-based property developer
Aviv Arlon will open a 30,000 square-meter (322,900 square feet)
retail park in Pancevo east of Belgrade next month.  The 28 million euro ($40 million) retail center will
include department stores, shops, cafes, restaurants and 700
parking spots on a 7.3 hectare (18 acre) lot, 14 kilometers (22
miles) from the Serbian capital, Marketing Manager Danka
Gladovic said.  Aviv Arlon has already completed a 4,500 square meter
portion of the complex and leased it long-term to a local
supermarket chain, she said.  The retail park is Aviv Arlonâ€™s first project in  Serbia ,
where it also plans a mixed-use residential and commercial
development in Belgrade, totaling 32,000 square meters and 280
residential units. Construction is to begin later this year with
completion expected by the end of 2012, Gladovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
