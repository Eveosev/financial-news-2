Canada ’s dollar declined against
its U.S. counterpart for a second day before the Bank of Canada
is scheduled to announce its target rate for overnight lending.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, weakened as  Japan 
was hit by two earthquakes stronger than magnitude 6 and the
government raised the severity level of its nuclear crisis to
the highest, matching the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  Oil prices 
fell.  “Canada is viewed as a commodity currency when it suits
and this is one of the times that it suits.” said Michael O’Neill, managing director at Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange
Inc. in Toronto. The drop in oil prices “questions the whole
global recovery story.”  The Canadian currency weakened 0.2 percent to 95.81 cents
per  U.S. dollar  at 8:20 a.m. in Toronto, from 95.66 cents
yesterday.  The Bank of Canada will probably keep its key interest rate
unchanged when it announces the results of a meeting at 9 a.m.
Toronto time. The target rate for overnight loans between
commercial banks will remain at 1 percent, where it has been
since September, according to all 28 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
