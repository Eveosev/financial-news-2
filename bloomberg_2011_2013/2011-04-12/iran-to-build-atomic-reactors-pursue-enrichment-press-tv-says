Iran  has plans to build “four to
five” new nuclear reactors for medical research,  Press TV 
reported, citing the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization,
Fereydoun Abbasi.  The research reactors will be built in different provinces
of the country and will each have a capacity of up to 20
megawatts, Abbasi said without giving details, according to the
state-run news channel.  Iran will continue enriching uranium to a 20 percent level
of purity to be able to fuel these reactors, Abbasi said. Iran
also plans to build a new enrichment site and to increase its
stockpile of 20-percent enriched uranium, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
