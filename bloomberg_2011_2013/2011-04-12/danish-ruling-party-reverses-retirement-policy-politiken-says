Denmark  can keep its early
retirement program if the age of eligibility is raised, Finance
Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen said in an interview with
Politiken.   The ruling  Liberal Party , of which Frederiksen is a member,
had previously said early retirement would have to be eliminated
to secure Denmarkâ€™s welfare system. The party later today will
present its financial plans for the next 10 years.  Frederiksen said in the interview with the Copenhagen-based
Politiken that the age of eligibility for early retirement would
have to be raised to 62 years, from 60. The age of regular
retirement also would have to raise more quickly to 67 years,
from 65, than previously proposed, Politiken quoted Frederiksen
as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
