Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker operated by  Fiat SpA (F) , plans to start selling
compressed natural gas-powered vehicles by 2017.  “The technology is very actively being worked on,” Bob
Lee, Chrysler’s vice president for engine and electrified
propulsion systems, said yesterday in an interview in Detroit.  Fiat, which owns 30 percent of Chrysler and plans to
increase the holding to 51 percent, has engines using compressed
natural gas in  Europe . Chrysler executives have explored
bringing that Fiat technology to the U.S.  “It’s a good way for some diversity in the market in terms
of fuel use,” Lee said at the SAE 2011 World Congress, an
automotive engineering convention in Detroit.  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of both Chrysler
and Fiat, has said natural-gas engines are an attractive way to
cut emissions because they’re cheaper than competing
technologies.  Chrysler is looking at the possibility of adding compressed
natural gas-powered engines to its Ram brand, Fred Diaz, head of
the truck unit, said in February.  “I’m eager and very interested to see what we can do with
CNG in our truck applications,” Diaz said.  Honda Motor Co. is the only automaker selling cars with
compressed natural gas engines to retail customers in the U.S.
 General Motors Co. (GM)  began selling vehicles with natural-gas
engines to U.S. fleet buyers last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
