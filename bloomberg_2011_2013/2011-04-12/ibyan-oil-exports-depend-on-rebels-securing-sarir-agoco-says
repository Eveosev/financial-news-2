The resumption of crude oil exports
from  Libya  depends on rebel forces securing Sarir, the North
African nation’s largest oil field, Arabian Gulf Oil Co. said.  The last oil tanker carrying Libyan crude sailed on April 6
from the rebel-controlled port of Tobruk, which is supplied by
Sarir and the neighboring Messla field, both operated by Arabian
Gulf Oil. Agoco, as the company is known, split from its parent
company, Tripoli-based National Oil Corp., a few days after
uprisings broke out in Libya.  International sanctions on Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
regime effectively stopped oil exports from areas under his
control in western and eastern Libya.  Attacks last week by Qaddafi’s troops forced production
from Sarir and Messla to a halt, Agoco’s head of communication,
Abdeljalil Mayouf, said in an interview today in the company’s
headquarters in Benghazi, the main city under control of the
National Transitional Council that is leading the rebellion.  Messla suffered “heavy damage” to pumps,  storage tanks 
and electricity equipment, while production from Sarir stopped
because the area remains vulnerable to attacks, he said.  “Messla will take months to repair; Sarir can return to
production once the area is secured,” he said.  While Sarir has a capacity to produce 200,000 barrels a
day, Agoco was operating it at half this rate since the fighting
started in February as the company had to withdraw staff for
security reasons, Mayouf said. Messla was running at one-third
of its 100,000 barrel-a-day capacity, he said.
