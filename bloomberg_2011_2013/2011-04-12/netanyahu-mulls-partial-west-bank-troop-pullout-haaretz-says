Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is considering a partial pullout of Israeli troops
from the  West Bank , Haaretz said, citing two people with ties to
Netanyahuâ€™s office.  The troops would be withdrawn from those parts of the West
Bank defined as Area B, where the  Palestinian Authority  has
administrative authority and Israel is responsible for security,
Haaretz said. Netanyahu is weighing the move as part of a new
plan to offset international diplomatic pressure on Israel to
advance the peace process with the Palestinians, Haaretz said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
