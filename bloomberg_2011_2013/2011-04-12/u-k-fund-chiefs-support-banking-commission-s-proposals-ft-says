Several U.K. fund managers welcomed
the reforms proposed for Britain’s banking sector, the Financial
Times reported, citing comments from the managers, who included
David Lis, head of U.K. equities at  Aviva Investors ; Richard Black, U.K. equities fund manager at Legal and General
Investment Management and James Alexander, head of equity
research at M&G Group Plc, .  A “largely silent majority of investors,” are in favor of
the introduction of structural reform and more stringent  capital
requirements , Alexander said, according to the FT.  The Independent Commission on Banking’s interim report
recommending ring-fencing U.K. retail banking operations and
making them hold more capital is “a decent compromise between
ensuring a safer banking system without putting the U.K. banks
at an international disadvantage,” Black said, the FT reported.  Lis said higher capital requirements “should strengthen
the system without damaging the economy in terms of compromising
the banks’ ability to lend,” the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
