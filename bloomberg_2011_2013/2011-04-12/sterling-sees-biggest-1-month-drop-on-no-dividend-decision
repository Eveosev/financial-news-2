Sterling Bank (STERLNBA)  Plc, a Nigerian
lender, fell the most in almost a month after the bank didn’t
declare a dividend or issue bonus shares after returning to
profit last year.  The stock lost 11 kobo, or 4.8 percent, its biggest daily
decline since March 15, to 2.19 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in
Lagos.  Net income rose to 5.04 billion naira ($32.6 million) from
a loss of 9.02 billion naira a year earlier, according to a
statement published on the Lagos-based Nigerian Stock Exchange’s
website today. Revenue decreased to 34.3 billion naira from 46.7
billion naira.  “The results are good, but investors want compensation for
their investments,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Lambeth Trust and Investment Co., said by phone
today. “Investors are reacting to the non-declaration of
dividend or bonus.”  Sterling has declined 5 percent this year, compared with a
0.4 percent increase in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index for the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
