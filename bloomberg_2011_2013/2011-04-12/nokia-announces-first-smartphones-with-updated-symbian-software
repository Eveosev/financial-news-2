Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the world’s biggest
maker of mobile phones, introduced an updated version of its
Symbian smartphone software and two new smartphones that will
run it.  The  E6  business phone, priced at about 340 euros ($492)
before taxes and subsidies, combines a hard Qwerty keyboard and
a touchscreen, the Finland-based company said. The  X7 
entertainment and gaming phone, with a base price of 380 euros
from Nokia, will be offered by Three UK, the carrier  said  on its
website today.  Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop said Feb. 11 that
Nokia will shift to Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Phone 7 as its
main smartphone operating system over the next two years,
phasing out Symbian. The version announced today, nicknamed
Symbian Anna, includes features promised last year, such as a
portrait-mode  Qwerty keyboard  and split-screen input. It will
also  be available  for download to existing units of Nokia’s
latest smartphones “in the coming months,” the company said.  “The new software shows the importance of Symbian in the
transition to Windows Phone 7 and represents a crucial step in
the effort to close the gap with rivals,” Ben Wood, a London-
based analyst with CCS Insight, said in a text message. “The X7
is unremarkable given current competitors. The E6 is an
attractive device that joins the growing list of BlackBerry
rivals, which should worry Research In Motion.”  Both handsets will start shipping in the second quarter,
Nokia said on its website, adding that the E6 will be available
in third quarter in  North America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
