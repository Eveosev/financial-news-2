Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s second-
largest maker of luxury cars, said it plans to team up with
 Robert Bosch GmbH  to build motors for electric vehicles.  Daimler and Bosch, the world’s largest maker of auto parts,
have begun negotiations on a 50/50 joint venture to start
production next year, the Stuttgart, Germany-based maker of
Mercedes-Benz vehicles said today in a statement.  The manufacturers aim to “accelerate development advances
in electric motors” and reduce costs, Daimler said. It plans to
install motors from the venture in Smart and Mercedes vehicles
starting in 2012.  Automakers are racing to introduce electric vehicles to
meet tighter emissions regulations and gain an edge with
customers concerned about the environment. Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG, which is developing its own electric motors, created
the “i” sub-brand for its electric vehicles and aims to
produce the unit’s first model, the i3 battery-powered city car,
in 2013.  Daimler is designing its vehicles to be powered by
conventional engines as well as electric power.  Bosch, which is also based in Stuttgart, will sell the
motors to other carmakers, Daimler said. The joint venture will
have locations in Stuttgart and Hildesheim,  Germany , where Bosch
currently manufactures electric motors.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
