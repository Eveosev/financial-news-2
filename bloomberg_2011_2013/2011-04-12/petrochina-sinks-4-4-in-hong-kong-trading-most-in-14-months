PetroChina Co., the country’s
largest oil company, led declines among fuel producers in Hong
Kong trading as crude fell for a second day in New York on
concern demand may slow.  The stock dropped as much as 4.7 percent, the most since
March 15.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s largest offshore oil producer,
fell 3.6 percent.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , Asia’s
biggest refiner, declined as much as 2.7 percent. The benchmark
 Hang Seng Index  retreated 1.3 percent at the midday break.  Crude headed for the biggest two-day drop in almost five
months after the International Monetary Fund cut growth
forecasts for the U.S. and Japan, saying high crude prices pose
a risk to global economic expansion.  “Oil is down, energy stocks are all down,” Brynjar Eirik Bustnes, a Hong Kong-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said
by telephone from Hong Kong. “Today is nothing specifically
about the companies.”  Oil futures for May delivery slid as much as $2.05, or 1.9
percent, to $107.87 in electronic trading in  New York . They were
at $108.19 at 11:48 a.m. Singapore time.  PetroChina was down 3.9 percent at HK$11.86 at the midday
break. Cnooc fell 3.3 percent to HK$19.78, while Sinopec, as
China Petroleum is known, dropped 1.7 percent to HK$8.10.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Ryan Woo, Jane Lee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
