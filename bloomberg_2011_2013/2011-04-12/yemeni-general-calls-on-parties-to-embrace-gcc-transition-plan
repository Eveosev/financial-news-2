Yemeni General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar,
the head of the country’s first armored division who defected
last month, said he welcomes an initiative by the Gulf
Cooperation Council to broker a transition of power from
President Ali Abdullah Saleh to Vice President Abduraboo Mansur Hadi.  In an e-mailed statement today, al-Ahmar called on both the
government and opposition to strive for dialogue to end the
political crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
