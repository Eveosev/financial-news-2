Heating oil fell the most in three
weeks on speculation that U.S. distillate inventories increased
last week as higher prices slowed economic growth and reduced
fuel demand.  Prices slipped 2.5 percent as supplies of distillates,
including heating oil and diesel, probably expanded 500,000
barrels last week, according to the median estimate of 17
analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News. U.S. import prices
increased in March at the fastest pace since June 2009, led by a
gain in crude oil and the biggest jump in food costs since 1994,
a Labor Department report today showed.  “There’s uncertainty about what these  price levels  mean
for the economy and demand levels,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“Without signs of an improving economy, you could see demand
destruction at these elevated prices.”  Heating oil for May delivery dropped 7.99 cents to settle
at $3.1726 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices
have tumbled 4.4 percent since closing at a 32-month high April
8.  Futures extended declines, following equities, after  Japan 
raised the severity rating of its nuclear crisis to the highest,
matching the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index was down 0.7 percent at 2:49 p.m. in New York.  Radiation Leak  The stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, about 220
kilometers (135 miles) north of  Tokyo , is leaking radiation in
Japan’s worst civilian nuclear disaster after a magnitude-9
quake and tsunami on March 11.  “The Japan situation got worse and the equities are
getting killed,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc., a broker on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . “We’re in a correction mode right now. We’re seeing a
lot of longs getting out.”  Heating oil’s decline was part of a broader slide in
commodities. Among the 19 raw materials on the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials, only cocoa and
lean hogs were up as of 2:50 p.m. in New York.  Futures sank as Brent oil for May settlement lost $3.32 to
$120.66 a barrel at 2:50 p.m. on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange while Nymex May-delivery crude dropped $3.67 to
$106.25. Crude will experience a “substantial pullback” with
Brent dropping to about $105 a barrel in the coming months,
analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. Goldman Sachs
yesterday ended a recommendation to buy a basket of commodities
including crude oil because the risks outweigh any further
potential gain.  ‘Big Sell-Off’  “You’re seeing big sell-off in commodities, the stock
market is down, you had the Japanese upgrade and the Goldman
reports,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply
at Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana,  Texas . “It was a confluence
of headlines.”  Heating oil also came under pressure as Europe’s gasoil
futures for May delivery declined 3.9 percent to $1,007.25 a
metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange at 2:52 p.m.
in New York. Gasoil futures on ICE and heating oil on Nymex are
traded as a substitute for diesel.  The supply of gasoil in independent storage in Europe’s
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub has risen to the
highest level since Dec. 19, PJK International BV said April 7.  The premium of heating oil over gasoline narrowed to 0.85
cent from 5.2 cents yesterday.  Global Growth  “Heating oil is more a barometer of global economic growth
and its larger decline may be reflective of concern about global
growth,” Knight said.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 3.64 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $3.1641 a gallon on the exchange.  Stockpiles probably dropped 1 million barrels last week,
according to the survey. It would be the eighth consecutive
decline and leave supplies at the lowest level since the week
ended Dec. 24. The Energy Department is scheduled to report last
week’s inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Regular gasoline at the pump increased 2.1 cents to $3.791
a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest
price since Sept. 19, 2008.  Retail prices, which averaged $2.76 last year from April
through September, will average $3.86 this year, the Energy
Department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook ,
released today in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
