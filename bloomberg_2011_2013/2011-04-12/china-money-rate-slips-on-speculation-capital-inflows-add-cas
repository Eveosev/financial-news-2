China ’s money-market rate fell for
a second day on speculation increasing capital inflows will add
cash to the financial system.  The People’s Bank of China sold 65 billion yuan ($9.9
billion) of one-year bills today at a yield of 3.3058 percent,
unchanged from the previous sale, according to a statement on
its website. Central bank purchases of foreign currency, used to
limit gains in the yuan, increased lenders’ cash holdings by 716
billion yuan in January and February, compared with 478 billion
in the first two months of 2010, official data showed.  “The increasing capital inflows are helping liquidity
remain ample in the  debt market ,” said Tang Guohui, a bond
trader at Industrial Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “The market
knows the central bank will raise lenders’ reserve ratios one
more time in April because there is so much liquidity.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped six basis points to 1.95 percent
as of 11:17 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted average
rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The central bank also sold 140 billion yuan of 28-day
 repurchase agreements  today, the biggest amount since January
2010. Total redemptions of central bank bills and repos amount
to 212 billion yuan this week, according to Wee-Khoon Chong, a
fixed-income strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong .  One-year swap interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined two
basis points to 3.33 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the 3.94 percent government bond due
January 2021 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3.87 percent, according to the Interbank Funding
Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Andrew Janes, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
