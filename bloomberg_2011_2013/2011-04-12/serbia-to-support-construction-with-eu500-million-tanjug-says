Serbia will support its
 construction industry  this year with 500 million euros ($720
million) in public investments in residential, infrastructure
and related projects,  Tanjug   news agency  reported, citing a
government minister.  The industry, which lost between 20,000 and 40,000 jobs
during the recession, will get a boost from the government plan
to build 1,700 subsidized apartments in 17 cities in the
country, along with sports halls, hospitals and kindergartens,
the newswire reported, quoting Oliver Dulic, in charge of
environment, mining and spatial planning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
