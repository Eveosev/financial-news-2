Slovakia’s plan to cut the  budget
deficit  to the European Union’s 3 percent of economic output
limit in three years is “credible and appropriate,” the
International Monetary Fund said.  The administration of Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova  has
raised indirect taxes and cut spending to reduce the shortfall
from last year’s 7.8 percent of gross domestic product to 4.9
percent of GDP this year. The gap is projected to fall below the
EU’s ceiling by 2013.  Implementing some expenditure cuts “may prove to be
difficult,” the Washington-based lender said in a statement
released after regular consultations with Slovak authorities.
Still, accelerating economic growth, which the IMF expects to
exceed 4 percent from next year, would help offset expenditure
overruns, the fund said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
