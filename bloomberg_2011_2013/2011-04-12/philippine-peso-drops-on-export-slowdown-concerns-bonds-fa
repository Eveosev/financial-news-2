The Philippine peso fell the most
in four weeks on concern higher oil costs will boost imports and
curb demand for the nation’s exports.  Government bonds  declined.  The currency extended yesterday’s retreat from a five-month
high after government data showed overseas sales rose 8.2
percent from a year earlier in February, the least in 15 months.
The  International Monetary Fund  lowered its 2011 economic growth
forecasts yesterday for the U.S. and Japan, the biggest buyers
of Philippine exports, to reflect higher  oil prices  and damage
caused by last month’s record earthquake in Japan.  “What is worrisome is that exports were weakening even
before the tragedy in Japan,” said Marcelo Ayes, senior vice
president for treasury at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in
Manila. “The outlook for strong exports is in danger and the
peso may lose some support.”  The peso fell 0.6 percent to 43.32 per dollar as of 11:19
a.m. in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
43.00 on April 8, the strongest level since Nov. 8. The currency
has strengthened 0.7 percent this year, while crude oil prices
jumped 18 percent in  New York .  The Philippines’ balance of payments surplus may be between
$6 billion and $8 billion this year, compared with $14.4 billion
in 2010, central bank Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said on
March 25.  The government’s benchmark three-year bonds fell for a
fourth day, their longest losing streak in a month. The yield on
the 6.25 percent note due January 2014 climbed 10 basis points,
or 0.1 percentage point, to 5 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services.  To contact the reporter for this story:
