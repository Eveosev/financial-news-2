Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said his government has decided on a replacement for
central bank governor Durmus Yilmaz and will reveal the name
after the nomination is approved by President  Abdullah Gul .  “We’re ready to make the appointment after having completed
preparation with the relevant minister,” Erdogan said in
televised comments in Ankara today. “However we think it would
be more appropriate that we reveal the name after the president
signs up.”  Erdogan will nominate deputy central bank governor Erdem Basci as central bank chief when Yilmaz’s five-year term expires
on April 18, 14 of 19 economists said in a Bloomberg survey
published last week. Fellow deputy governor Ibrahim Turhan,
Treasury Undersecretary Ibrahim Canakci and chief banking
industry regulator Tevfik Bilgin were also cited as candidates.  Deputy Prime Minister  Ali Babacan  is in charge of relations
with the central bank as chief of Turkey's economy portfolio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
