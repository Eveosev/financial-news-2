Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  fell after companies including Alcoa Inc. reported
earnings that missed forecasts and commodity prices dropped.  American depositary receipts of Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s
second-largest carmaker, retreated 0.7 percent from the closing
price in Tokyo, after Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities
Co. cut its rating on the company. ADRS of Alumina Ltd., partner
in the world’s biggest producer of the material used to make
aluminum, tumbled 2 percent from the closing price in Sydney.
Those of BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s No. 1 mining company,
dropped 2 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,500 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,560
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,500 in
 Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index dropped 0.5 percent today.  “Uncertainty is lingering about the economy and corporate
earnings” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “Investors will likely sell stocks
following yesterday’s selloff in the U.S. and Europe on lower
energy prices.”  In New York, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.8
percent to 1,314.16 yesterday, as Japan raised the severity
rating of its nuclear crisis to the highest level, oil plunged
and sales at Alcoa., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, missed
estimates. Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  gained 0.1 percent today.  Alcoa Misses Estimates  Alcoa’s sales for the first quarter increased 22 percent
from a year earlier to $5.96 billion, the company said yesterday
in a statement. That trailed the $6.06 billion average estimate
of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  J. Front Retailing Co. reported net income of 8.9 billion
yen ($106 million) for the 12 months ending March 31, missing
its forecast by 8.6 percent, the company said yesterday after
markets closed. The Tokyo-based department store operator
projected profit will decline 49 percent this year amid lower
consumer sentiment following last month’s record earthquake and
tsunami.  Crude oil for May delivery plunged 3.3 percent to $106.25 a
barrel in  New York  yesterday, the lowest settlement since March
30, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast a “substantial”
correction in prices of the fuel. The  International Energy
Agency  and  International Monetary Fund  said  oil prices  above
$100 a barrel are starting to hurt the global economy.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.5 percent by the S&P
500 and 0.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency yesterday
raised its severity rating of the accident at the Fukushima
reactors to the highest level of 7, which matches the 1986
Chernobyl disaster. The accident was previously rated 5 on the
global scale, the same as the 1979 partial reactor meltdown at
Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporters on this story:
