The Treasury Department’s $32
billion sale of three-year notes may draw a yield of 1.293
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 9 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The offering is the same size as the previous six sales,
matching the smallest since February 2009. The securities, which
mature in April 2014, yielded 1.295 percent in pre-auction
trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  Last month’s auction of three-year notes drew a yield of
1.298 percent, compared with a record-low 0.569 percent at the
October sale.  The March 8 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.22, compared with an average of 3.14 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 34.4 percent of the notes at the
March sale, compared with 27.6 percent at the February auction.
The average for the past 10 offerings was 37.2 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.3 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 14.1
percent for the past 10 auctions.  Three-year notes have lost 0.3 percent this year, trailing
the 0.6 percent decline for Treasuries overall, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The Treasury is selling $66 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It’s due to auction $21 billion of 10-year securities
tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year debt on April 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
