German chipmaker  Infineon
Technologies AG (IFX)  sued smaller U.S. rival Atmel Corp., alleging
infringement of 11 patents for microcircuitry used in
automotive, industrial and control-system applications.  Infineon, based in Neubiberg, is seeking a jury trial,
unspecified damages and an order to stop Atmel, of  San Jose ,
California, from using the technology, according to a complaint
filed yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “Atmel has actual knowledge” of the claims, in part
“based on written notice and at least one or more meetings”
with Infineon, the plaintiff contends in court papers.  Infineon, which also seeks a ruling that it doesn’t
infringe three Atmel patents, reported more than $4.47 billion
in revenue last fiscal year. Atmel logged $1.64 billion in 2010
sales.  “ We haven’t seen the details yet but do not believe we
have infringed and plan to vigorously defend our interests,”
Peter Schuman, an Atmel spokesman, said in an e-mailed message.  The case is Infineon Technologies AG v.  Atmel Corp. (ATML) , U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
