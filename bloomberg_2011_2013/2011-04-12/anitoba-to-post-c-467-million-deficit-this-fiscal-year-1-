The Canadian province of Manitoba
will record a C$467 million ($485 million) deficit in the fiscal
year that began April 1, including a C$3 million contingency for
flood-related expenses, according to Finance Minister Rosann Wowchukâ€™s  budget  released today. The province will return to
budget balance in the 2014-15 fiscal year, Wowchuk said.  The fiscal plan is based on economic growth of 2.7 percent
this year and in 2012, following 2.5 percent growth in 2010, the
budget documents show.  The province  plans  to borrow C$3.77 billion during the
year, including about C$1.96 billion for refinancing purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
