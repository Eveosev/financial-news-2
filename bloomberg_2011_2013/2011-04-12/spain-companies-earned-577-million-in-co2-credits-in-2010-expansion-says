Spanish industrial polluters made
about 400 million euros ($577 million) in the carbon market last
year by cutting emissions, which generated a surplus of
allowances, Expansion reported, citing a European Union report.  The 1,127 regulated companies received from authorities
28.8 million more carbon-emission credits than they needed,
creating a paper profit of about 400 million euros using an
average carbon permit price of 14 euros, the Madrid-based
newspaper  reported .  Plants that make steel, cement, ceramics, paper,
electricity or refine oil together lowered emissions by an
average 11 percent last year, Expansion reported.  That was owing to energy-efficiency measures, reduced
factory production and the debut of renewable-energy  power
plants , Expansion said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
