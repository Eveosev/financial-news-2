Unrest spreading through Middle
East and African oil producing nations may increase the risk of
additional shortfalls in crude supply, the  International Energy
Agency  said.  Fears that production halts could spread through the region
“underpin current high oil price levels,” the Paris-based IEA
said today in its monthly report.  The combined oil production of nine countries hit by unrest
is 3.3 million barrels a day, the IEA said. The nations are
Yemen, Bahrain, Syria, Oman, Tunisia,  Egypt , Gabon, Ivory Coast
and Sudan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
