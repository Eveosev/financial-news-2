Kenya ’s shilling weakened against
the dollar for a second day amid increased demand for the U.S.
currency by oil importers.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.1 percent to 84.30 per dollar. It closed at 84.20
yesterday.  "The local unit has weakened slightly against the dollar as
the demand for the greenback by oil importers picks up," Mwambu
Malamba, a senior trader at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of
Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today. The currency is
expected to trade at 84.20 to 84.50 "in the coming days," he
said.  Oil importers account for as much as 60 percent of the
monthly purchase of dollars in Kenya’s foreign-exchange market,
according to Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at NIC Bank Ltd. in
Nairobi.  Oil futures headed for their biggest two-day drop in almost
five months after the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook
that the  U.S. economy  will expand at a slower pace than in 2010
amid an  unemployment rate  above 8 percent and a drop in  consumer
confidence . Oil also slipped as the  African Union  tried to
negotiate a cease-fire in Libya and Nigeria prepared for a
presidential election amid violent clashes that have seized the
country since July.  Oil for May delivery slid as much as $2.05, or 1.9 percent,
to $107.87 a barrel, in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, and was at $109.45 at 9:06 a.m. London
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
