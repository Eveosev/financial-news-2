China ’s power demand may gain 12
percent this year, said the research unit of the nation’s
largest electricity distributor.  Power consumption may rise to 4.7 trillion kilowatt-hours,
according to slides presented by State Grid Corp. of China’s
research institute at a conference in Beijing today. First-
quarter electricity use grew 13 percent from a year earlier to
1.1 trillion kilowatt-hours, State Grid said.  The forecast is higher than an earlier estimate from the
National Energy Administration. Power demand may rise 9 percent
to 4.5 trillion kilowatt-hours this year, slowing from a 15
percent gain in 2010, the administration said on Jan. 28.  China’s power-station coal use may increase 9 percent to
1.9 billion tons this year, according to the slides.  Electricity demand may rise to 6.57 trillion kilowatt-hours
by 2015, China Huaneng Group Corp.’s Chief Economist  Wu Dawei 
said at the conference. Demand for coal to fuel  power plants 
will climb to 1.4 billion tons, he said.  Generators using non-fossil fuels may account for 33
percent of China’s total by then, according to Wu.  -- Chua Baizhen , Winnie Zhu. Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
