The following is the text of
the U.S. trade balance report for Feb. released by the
Commerce Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, through the  Department of Commerce , announced
today that total February exports of $165.1 billion and
imports of $210.9 billion resulted in a goods and services
deficit of $45.8 billion, down from $47.0 billion in
January, revised.  February exports were $2.4 billion less
than January exports of $167.5 billion.  February imports
were $3.6 billion less than January imports of $214.5
billion.  In February, the goods deficit decreased $1.0 billion from
January to $59.3 billion, and the services surplus
increased $0.3 billion to $13.6 billion.  Exports of goods
decreased $2.5 billion to $118.0 billion, and imports of
goods decreased $3.4 billion to $177.3 billion.  Exports
of services were virtually unchanged at $47.2 billion, and
imports of services decreased $0.2 billion to $33.6
billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $6.0 billion from
February 2010 to February 2011.  Exports were up $20.5
billion, or 14.2 percent, and imports were up $26.6
billion, or 14.4 percent.  Goods (Census basis)  The January to February decrease in exports of goods
reflected decreases in automotive vehicles, parts, and
engines ($1.0 billion); industrial supplies and materials
($0.6 billion); other goods ($0.5 billion); capital goods
($0.3 billion);
 consumer goods  ($0.2 billion); and foods, feeds  and
beverages ($0.2 billion).  The January to February decrease in imports of goods
reflected decreases in automotive vehicles, parts, and
engines ($2.3 billion); capital goods ($2.1 billion);
industrial supplies and materials ($1.4 billion); and
other goods ($0.1 billion). Increases occurred in consumer
goods ($2.3 billion) and foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.1
billion).  The February 2010 to February 2011 increase in exports of
goods reflected increases in industrial supplies and
materials ($9.6 billion); capital goods ($4.0 billion);
foods, feeds, and beverages ($1.9 billion); automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($1.0 billion); and consumer
goods ($0.8 billion). Other goods were virtually
unchanged.  The February 2010 to February 2011 increase in imports of
goods reflected increases in industrial supplies and
materials ($9.2 billion); consumer goods ($5.7 billion);
capital goods ($5.7 billion); automotive vehicles, parts,
and engines ($3.3 billion); and foods, feeds, and
beverages ($1.4 billion). A decrease occurred in other
goods ($0.3 billion).  Services  Services exports were virtually unchanged from January to
February.  An increase in other private services (which
includes items such as business, professional, and
technical services, insurance services, and financial
services) was partly offset by a decrease in other
transportation (which includes freight and port services).
Changes in the other categories of services exports were
small.  Services imports decreased $0.2 billion from January
to February.  The decrease was more than accounted for by
decreases in other transportation and travel.  An increase
in other private services was partly offsetting.  Changes
in the other categories of services imports were small.  The February 2010 to February 2011 increase in
exports of services was $2.9 billion.  The largest
increases were in other private services ($1.8 billion),
travel ($0.6 billion), and passenger fares ($0.3 billion).
Within other private services, the largest increases were
in business, professional, and technical services and
financial services.  The February 2010 to February 2011 increase in
imports of services was $1.1 billion.  The largest
increases were in other private services ($1.0 billion),
other transportation ($0.3 billion), and passenger fares
($0.3 billion). Within other private services, the largest
increases were in insurance services and business,
professional, and technical services.  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in February, exports of goods
and services averaged $165.3 billion, while imports of
goods and services averaged $209.7 billion, resulting in
an average trade deficit of $44.3 billion.  For the three
months ending in January, the average trade deficit was
$41.8 billion, reflecting average exports of $163.7
billion and average imports of $205.5 billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The February figures show surpluses, in billions of
dollars, with Hong Kong $2.5 ($2.2 for January), Australia
$1.4 ($1.2), Singapore $0.8 ($0.8), and Egypt $0.5 ($0.5).
