Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said the central bank is coordinating with regulators in
the U.S. and abroad to improve the foundation and oversight of
derivatives markets.  “The challenge facing the Board is to enhance supervision,
oversight, and prudential standards of major derivatives market
participants in a manner that promotes more-effective risk
management and reduces systemic risk, yet retain the significant
benefits of derivatives to the businesses and investors who use
them to manage financial market risks,” Tarullo said in the
text of remarks to the Senate Banking Committee today. “The Fed
is working diligently to achieve these goals.”  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s board today voted to
seek comment on a joint proposal with the Fed and other
agencies. The measure, part of the FDIC’s rulemaking under the
Dodd-Frank Act, would govern how much margin must be set aside
to reduce the risk in swaps involving banks. The Fed is also
working with international groups including the  Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision , Tarullo said.  “The goal of all these efforts is to develop a consistent
international approach to the regulation and supervision of
derivatives products and market infrastructures as well as to
the sound implementation of the agreed-upon approaches,”
Tarullo said. “Our aim is to promote both financial stability
and fair competitive conditions to the fullest extent
possible.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
