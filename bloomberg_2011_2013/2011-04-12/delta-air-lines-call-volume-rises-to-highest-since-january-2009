Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s call-option
volume rose to the highest level in more than two years as an
investor sold an existing bullish position to buy another one
that expires later this year. The shares rose as oil plunged.  The trades, which involve three separate contracts, roll
existing bullish call-options positions closer to the current
stock price and move from June expiration to September,
according to a report from Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based
provider of options-market data and analytics.  The world’s second-largest carrier rallied for a second
day, climbing 5.4 percent to $9.94 at 3:31 p.m. in New York. The
Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index rose 3.4 percent, with 11 of 12
members gaining, as the price of crude oil had its biggest two-
day drop in almost 11 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
