Poland’s government is sticking by
its estimate that the country’s general government budget
deficit totaled 7.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2010,
Deputy Finance Minister  Ludwik Kotecki  said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Kotecki said preliminary estimates of the general
government deficit published by the Warsaw-based  Central
Statistical Office  on April 8, which showed last year’s general
government deficit at about 7.4 percent of GDP, were based on
data available as of March 2 and are less up-to-date than a
later notification sent to Eurostat, the European Union’s
Statistics Office in Luxembourg.  Kotecki said Eurostat will publish the official Polish
general government budget figures on April 26.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
