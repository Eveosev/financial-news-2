Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711) , Japan’s
third-largest copper producer, said it plans to increase
production by 2.2 percent this calendar year at its Gresik
smelter in Indonesia.  The Tokyo-based company’s Indonesian unit, PT Smelting,
will produce 283,000 metric tons of copper this year, compared
with 277,000 tons last year, company spokesman Toshiaki Yamada
said today. Last year, output at the smelter declined because of
a 20-day maintenance shutdown in May, Yamada said.  PT Smelting, with an annual capacity of 300,000 tons, is
60.5 percent-owned by Mitsubishi Materials. Freeport-McMoRan
Gold & Copper Inc. has a 25 percent stake,  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  owns
9.5 percent and JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corp., a unit of  JX
Holdings Inc. (5020) , has 5 percent.  Output from the smelter is sold to  Indonesia  and
neighboring Southeast Asian nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
