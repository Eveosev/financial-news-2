Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  Chairman Jorma Ollila
said the company expects further losses in smartphone market
share before seeing gains from its plan for a new series of
phones to be based on  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows operating system
that will replace its Symbian system, the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview.  Nokia’s board had “discussed explicitly that there would
be an expected lower market share in the meantime, with the
opportunity then to pick up and build on the new concept,”
Ollila said, according to the FT.  The agreement with Microsoft is set to be completed by the
end of the month, the FT said. The splitting of revenue will
involve Nokia’s participating “in advertising revenue in a way
that we’ve never been able to do before,” Nokia’s Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Elop told the FT in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
