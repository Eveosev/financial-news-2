Comparisons between U.S. earnings
and analysts’ estimates bear watching during the next few weeks
because the trend is going against investors.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the percentage of companies in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that posted more profit than the
average analyst projection each quarter since 2005, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The proportion has fallen three straight quarters for the
longest streak since 2000, when the 1990s Internet bubble burst.
There haven’t been four straight quarterly declines since
Bloomberg started putting together its figures in 1992.  Prospects for earnings are “the central reason that the
U.S. stock market has remained resilient in the face of so much
troubling news around the world,” Nicholas Colas, chief market
strategist at BNY ConvergEx Group LLC, wrote in an April 7
commentary.  In the first three months of last year, 78 percent of S&P
500 companies beat the average projection. The figure was the
second-highest ever, trailing only the 80 percent recorded in
the third quarter of 2009.  Since then, the percentage has approached the historical
average of 60 percent. The fourth-quarter figure, 68 percent,
was the lowest for the current  bull market .  To contact the reporter on this story:
