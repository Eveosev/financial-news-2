Former Major League Baseball player
Jose Canseco was named player/manager of the Yuma Scorpions in
the independent  North American League .  Canseco, who admitted to steroid use during his 17-year
career and wrote a book that heightened interest in the
performance-enhancing drug habits of major-leaguers, will play
first base or designated hitter while also managing, the Yuma,
Arizona, franchise said on its  website .  Canseco’s twin brother, Ozzie, will also play while serving
as the team’s hitting and bench coach.  The 46-year-old Canseco was a six-time major-league All-
Star who retired in 2001 with 462 home runs and 1,407 runs
batted in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
