Tanzania’s benchmark coffee price
fell 5.8 percent at an auction on April 8 after the quality of
the beans declined, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The average price of the top arabica grade slipped to an
average of $292.79 per 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $310.76
a fortnight earlier, the board said in an e-mailed report today.
Supplies of the grade fell 53 percent to 1,211 bags, it said.  “Most of the coffee offered was of ordinary quality as we
get closer to the end of 2010-11 season,” the board said. Since
February the agency has held sales every two weeks, instead of
weekly, as supplies of the beans drop.  The East African nation is boosting coffee planting in an
effort to raise output to 100,000 metric tons by 2015, according
to Adolph Kumburu, the board’s director general. Production in
the 12 months through June may rise 54 percent to more than
55,000 tons because of improved weather, he said on March 23.  Tanzania grows both the robusta and arabica varieties in
the western Kagera region, while the northern Kilimanjaro and
southern regions mainly produce arabica. The country is  Africa ’s
fifth-largest coffee producer after  Ethiopia ,  Uganda , the Ivory
Coast and  Guinea .  The following are details of the April 8 auction in U.S.
