Oil fell, capping the biggest two-
day drop in almost 11 months, after the  International Energy
Agency  and  International Monetary Fund  said that prices above
$100 a barrel are starting to hurt the global economy and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast a “substantial” correction.  Oil plunged 3.3 percent after the IEA reported signs of an
oil-demand “slowdown” in its monthly Oil Market Report today.
The IMF cut its growth forecasts yesterday for the U.S. and
Japan, two of the top three oil-consuming countries. Brent oil
may drop more than $15 to $105 a barrel, Goldman said in a note
to clients today.  “Right now, we’re in free-fall range,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,
 Pennsylvania . “We have a market condition that was way
overbought, so now its length is getting stomped out of the
market. There could be a ways to go in this selloff.”  Crude oil for May delivery fell $3.67 to $106.25 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
March 30. Prices have tumbled 5.8 percent since April 8, the
biggest two-day retreat since May 14 and 17, 2010. Futures have
risen 26 percent in the past year.  Prices declined from the settlement after the  American
Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles rose 1.19 million barrels to 355.5 million. May oil
was down $3.90, or 3.6 percent, to $106.02 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:33 p.m.  ‘The Surest Remedy’  “There are real risks that a sustained $100-plus price
environment will prove incompatible with the currently expected
pace of economic recovery,” the Paris-based IEA said. “The
surest remedy for high prices may ultimately prove to be high
prices themselves.”  The U.S. today boosted its crude-oil price forecast for
2011 to an average $106.38 a barrel from $101.77 a barrel last
month, according to the Energy Department’s Short-Term Energy
Outlook. It left its global consumption forecast unchanged at
88.2 million barrels a day.  Yesterday, the Paris-based IEA said worldwide oil demand
will rise by 1.4 million barrels, or 1.6 percent, this year to
average 89.4 million a day. The forecast was unchanged from
March.  The U.S., the world’s largest economy, will expand 2.8
percent this year, down from 2.9 percent last year and a 3
percent growth rate for 2011 forecast in January, the IMF said
yesterday. It cut  Japan ’s 2011 growth forecast to 1.4 percent
from 1.6 percent in a January forecast.  Confirming Suspicions  “Yesterday’s IMF statement that the U.S. and Japan
economies are being hurt by higher energy prices confirmed
everybody’s suspicions,” said  Sarah Emerson , managing director
of Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .
“We’ll move back to the $104-$105 level where we’ve got some
technical support.”  Brent oil for May settlement fell $3.06, or 2.5 percent, to
end the session at $120.92 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  The oil market will pull back toward a $105-a-barrel near-
term target for Brent,  David Greely  in New York and  Jeffrey Currie  in  London  said in the Goldman report. They cited high
inventories and spare production capacity.  “There’s fundamental support for the market, just at a
lower level than prices had risen,” Greely, head of energy
research at Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone interview.
“There’s support longer term, particularly in 2012. Prices
simply rose sooner than the physical market supports.”  U.S. crude oil stockpiles probably increased 1 million
barrels last week, according to a survey of 16 analysts before
an Energy Department report tomorrow.  Commodity Basket  Yesterday, oil tumbled from a 30-month high of $112.79 a
barrel as Goldman Sachs ended a recommendation to buy a basket
of commodities including crude oil, copper, cotton and platinum,
saying the risks outweigh any further potential gain. The basket
of raw materials was first recommended by Currie on Dec. 1. It
had gained 25 percent since then.  “The Goldman thing is probably one of the bigger
factors,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisors in Houston. “A whole lot of the market is still
dictated by  money flow . You’ve got a situation where Goldman
decided to take profits.”  The so-called CCCP basket had a 40 percent weighting in
oil, 20 percent in copper, 10 percent in soybeans, 10 percent
cotton and 20 percent platinum.  Japanese Nuclear Crisis  Oil also fell today after Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial
Safety Agency raised the severity rating of its nuclear crisis
at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi station to the highest level, matching
the severity of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and boosting concern
that the crisis will curb Japanese demand.  The accident at the plant followed a record earthquake and
tsunami on March 11.  “No matter how much oil people think they’re going to
export to Japan to make up for the nuclear loss, we’re going to
see that economy take a turn for the worse,” said Carl Larry,
president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “If Japan
really starts to deteriorate, its biggest trade partner is
 China , and they’re going to feel it next.”  China is the second-biggest oil-consuming country.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 993,886
contracts as of 4:33 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 747,902
contracts yesterday, 6.3 percent below the average of the past
three months and the highest level since March 16. Open interest
was 1.57 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
