Yuan non-deliverable forwards fell
the most in almost a month as investors sought the relative
safety of the dollar after the  International Monetary Fund  cut
growth estimates for two of the world’s three biggest economies.  The IMF trimmed its forecast for U.S. growth to 2.8 percent
from 3 percent for 2011, while lowering  Japan ’s to 1.4 percent
from 1.6 percent, according to the World Economic Outlook report
published on its website. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index fell the
most since March 15 as Japan raised the severity rating of the
crisis at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant to the highest
level.  “Risk appetite was weaker due to the downgrades in gross
domestic product forecasts,” said Pin Ru Tan, a strategist in
 Singapore  at the Royal Bank of Scotland Group.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.18 percent,
the most since March 15, to 6.3875 per dollar as of 4:48 p.m. in

the end of 1993.  Offshore Market  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.11
percent to 6.5320 per dollar. The difference between the
offshore and onshore rates narrowed from the widest level since

Investment Trust, which is seeking as much as 11.2 billion yuan
($1.7 billion) from an initial public offering in the city,
