Canada ’s trade surplus narrowed in
February as exports of automobile and energy products plunged.  The country recorded a surplus of C$33 million ($34.4
million) from a revised C$382 million surplus in January,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Exports fell 4.9
percent, offsetting a 4 percent drop in imports. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted a C$500 million February
surplus, from an initially reported surplus of C$116 million the
previous month, according to the median of 24 responses.  The  trade balance  has improved from July’s record deficit
of C$2.39 billion even as the Canadian dollar rose, in part
because of a rebound in U.S. demand. The Canadian dollar reached
95.27 cents per  U.S. dollar  on April 8, the strongest level
since November 2007.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  is counting on exports
and investment to drive economic growth through next year as
government stimulus ends and consumers are stretched by record
debts. Policy makers will probably leave their main interest
rate at 1 percent today, according to a Bloomberg economist
survey.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada’s new home price
index rose 0.4 percent in February. Economists predicted the
index would rise 0.2 percent, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey with 12 responses.  Exports fell to C$35.9 billion, led by a 12 percent decline
in automotive products and an 8 percent drop in energy. Imports
fell 4 percent to C$35.8 billion,  Statistics Canada  said.  The volume of imports, which excludes the impact of price
changes, declined 4.3 percent while exports dropped 5.2 percent.  The trade surplus with the U.S., Canada’s largest trading
partner, widened to C$4.58 billion in February from C$4.13
billion in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
