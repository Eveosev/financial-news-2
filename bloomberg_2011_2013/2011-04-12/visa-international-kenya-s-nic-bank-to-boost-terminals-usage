Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest
electronic payments network, plans to grow the number of point-
of-sale terminals in  Kenya  threefold over the next three years.  Kenya, East  Africa ’s biggest economy, currently has 9,000
terminals and 22 partner banks, Gerald Hawkins, group general
manager for Africa, said today in an interview in Nairobi, the
capital.  The terminals “should be increased by a factor of two or
three,” Hawkins said. “Traditionally, the banks start by
issuing their own cards.”  Kenya had 55,235 credit card transactions and 466,523
point-of-sale machines in October compared with 54,353
transactions and 443,633 units a month earlier, according to the
Central Bank of Kenya’s  website . The value of credit card
transactions in October was 314 million shillings ($3.7 million)
compared with 323 million shillings the previous month,
according to the  central bank .  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , one of Visa’s partners in Kenya, plans to
double its number of credit card customers over two years, James
Wainaina, director for personal banking, said today, without
providing further details. The lender, which began offering
credit card services in 2005, has recorded between 15 percent
and 20 percent growth of its credit card business year-on-year
for the last three years, Wainaina said.  “The intent is for us to bring on board our customers who
don’t have cards,” he said.  This year, NIC Bank is targeting growth of as much as 30
percent in its credit-card business, based on increased
customers and transactions, Wainaina said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
