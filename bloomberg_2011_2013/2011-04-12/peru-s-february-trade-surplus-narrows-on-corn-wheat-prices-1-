Peru ’s  trade surplus  narrowed in
February after imports rose on higher prices for corn and wheat
and rising demand for industrial machinery.  The Andean country posted a $797 million trade surplus in
February, compared with an $833 million surplus a year ago,
Peru’s National Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed report.
January’s trade surplus was $234 million.  Imports jumped 35 percent to $2.45 billion in February from
a year earlier, the agency said. Exports climbed 23 percent to
$3.25 billion after metal prices rose. Minerals, led by gold and
copper, accounted for 62 percent of the nation’s exports while
oil and gas make up 10 percent.  Higher costs for corn used to feed chickens led Peruvian
consumer prices to rise the most in almost three years last
month.  The sol weakened 0.3 percent to 2.8099 per dollar at 12:01
p.m. New York time from 2.8025 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
