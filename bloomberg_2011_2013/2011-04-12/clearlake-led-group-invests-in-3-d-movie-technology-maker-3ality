Clearlake Capital Group LP, a
private-equity firm that’s invested $2.6 billion in more than 50
deals, said it led an investment in 3ality Digital, a movie and
television technology company. Terms weren’t disclosed.  Clearlake  used capital from its second private-equity fund,
a $415 million pool that completed raising money in January
2010, according to a statement today. The firm, with offices in
 Santa Monica ,  California , and New York, will control the company
along with 3ality’s management.  Movies such as “The Amazing Spider-Man” and “The
Hobbit” are being produced with Burbank, California-based
3ality’s technology, which uses a technique known as digital
stereoscopic 3-D, according to the statement. The company’s
products are designed to drive down the cost of creating 3-D
content as filmmakers such as  James Cameron  promote the
technology and consumers snap up 3-D enabled TV sets to watch
movies and sports.  Behdad Eghbali, a Clearlake founding partner, and Prashant
Mehrotra, a vice president at the firm, joined the 3ality board
as part of the transaction. Denver-based  Headwaters MB  advised
Clearlake on the deal, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
