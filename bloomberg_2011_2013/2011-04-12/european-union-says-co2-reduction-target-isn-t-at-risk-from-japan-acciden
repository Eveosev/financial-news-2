European Union Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger said that the region’s target to cut carbon
emissions by 20 percent in 2020 wasn’t at risk from the nuclear
accident in  Japan .  Oettinger, speaking at a conference in Brussels today, said
that stress tests on nuclear plants are “more important than
before” after Japan increased the severity rating on its atomic
crisis to the highest level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
