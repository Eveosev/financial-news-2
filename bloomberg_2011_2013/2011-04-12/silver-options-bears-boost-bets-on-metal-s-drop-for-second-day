Trading of bearish options on an
exchange-traded fund tracking silver jumped to 3.7 times the
four-week average, boosted by a single trade for a second day,
as futures on the metal snapped a seven-day winning streak.  More than a quarter of all volume for puts to sell the
 iShares Silver Trust (SLV)  ETF was concentrated in 100,000 contracts
in a strategy known as a butterfly spread, according to
OptionsHawk.com, a Boston-based provider of options-market
analytics. The trade profits most if the fund falls 7.9 percent
to $36 before May options expire, and follows yesterday’s
purchase of 100,000 July $25 puts.  “This is interesting in the context of yesterday’s
trade,” said Caitlin Duffy, an equity-options analyst at
Greenwich, Connecticut-based  Interactive Brokers Group Inc. (IBKR) 
“There’s similar sentiment between yesterday and today because
this runup has lost momentum and may be due for a turnaround.”  The fund fell 0.3 percent to $39.09 at 4 p.m. in New York
and is down from an intraday record of $40.33 yesterday, when
the metal reached a 31-year high. Silver futures for May
delivery fell 1.4 percent to $40.05 an ounce on the Comex.  In the butterfly trade, the investor sold 50,000 May $36
puts while buying 25,000 each of the May $34 puts and May $38
puts. The trade cost 31 cents per contract and may be worth up
to $1.69 if the shares are at $36 at expiration on May 20,
according to Duffy. The investor risks losing what they paid if
the shares rise.  Yesterday’s trade, which was an almost $1 million bet that
the ETF will decline by July, was the session’s biggest single
options trade on U.S. exchanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
