Gold retreated as a rally to a
record prompted some investors to sell and a tumble in energy
prices, sparked by reduced economic growth forecasts from the
 International Monetary Fund , reduced inflationary pressures.  Immediate-delivery bullion fell 0.4 percent to $1,456.78 an
ounce at 3:16 p.m. in  Singapore  after touching an all-time high
of $1,478.18 yesterday. Gold for June delivery in  New York  lost
0.7 percent to $1,457.70, retreating from a record $1,478.  Crude in New York dropped 2.5 percent yesterday from a 30-
month high and extended that decline today, losing 1.9 percent
to $107.87 per barrel. The IMF said in a global outlook the U.S.
will expand 2.8 percent this year, slower than 2010, and the
Japanese growth forecast was cut to 1.4 percent from 1.6 percent.  “The rally of  gold prices  has a shaky footing as there
have still hardly been any inflows into exchange-traded funds
and correction potential is building up,”  Eugen Weinberg , head
of commodity research at Commerzbank AG, wrote in a note. “A
broader correction of commodity prices seems to be needed.”  Gold soared 26 percent in the past year and silver more
than doubled as unrest in the Middle East boosted oil,  Europe ’s
governments grappled with a sovereign-debt crisis and  Japan  was
struck by a record earthquake. Assets held in exchange-traded
products stood at 2,050 metric tons on April 11 compared with
the record 2,114.6 tons on Dec. 20, data from 10 providers show.  Bearish Sentiment  “Sentiment in gold and silver markets will likely be
bearish,” said Ong Yi Ling, Singapore-based analyst with
Phillip Futures Pte. “Investors may be eager to lock in profits
after the recent rally, fearing the exit of large commodity
players from the market.”  Gold has come under pressure after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
ended a recommendation to buy a basket of commodities including
crude oil, copper, cotton and platinum, Ong said. Goldman said
the risks outweigh any further potential gain.  The basket of raw materials was first recommended Dec. 1
and gained 25 percent since then, the bank’s team of analysts,
led by London-based  Jeffrey Currie , said in a report yesterday.
It had a 40 percent weighting in oil, 20 percent copper, 10
percent soybeans, 10 percent cotton and 20 percent platinum.  Cash silver shed as much as 1 percent to $39.8375 an ounce
after reaching $41.9525 yesterday, the highest level since 1980.
Spot palladium climbed 0.5 percent to $781.25 an ounce, while
platinum gained 0.2 percent to $1,787.05 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
