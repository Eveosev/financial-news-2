India’s imports of coal from  South
Africa  fell 29 percent in April from a year earlier while
Chinese purchases rose, according to mjunction Services Ltd.  South  Africa  supplied 1.21 million metric tons of the fuel

trader said in an e-mail. That was 18 percent lower than the
1.48 million in March.  China ’s purchases rose 12 percent to
504,000 tons in April from March, and none in a year earlier
period, it said.  Coal prices at Richards Bay Terminal, Africa’s biggest
export facility for the fuel, rose to the highest in almost a
month, gaining 0.3 percent to $123.93 a ton from May 3 to May 6,
the highest since the week ended April 15, data from
Petersfield, U.K.-based researcher IHS McCloskey showed. They
climbed 45 percent in April from a year earlier, and 1.6 percent
from March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shipments from Richards Bay terminal fell to 4.81 million
tons last month from 5.36 million in March, according to the
statement on the port website.  India  accounts for a quarter of
the exports.  Asia ’s imports of coal from South Africa dropped 15 percent
