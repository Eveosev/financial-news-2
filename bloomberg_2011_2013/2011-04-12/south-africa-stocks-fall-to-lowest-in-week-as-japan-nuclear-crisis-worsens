South African stocks dropped to the
lowest in a month, led by miners  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  BHP
Billiton Plc (BIL) , as copper fell a second day and  Japan  raised the
severity rating of its nuclear crisis to match Chernobyl.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index retreated 1.8 percent
to 32,239.87 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency today raised
the severity of the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
station to the highest rating, matching Chernobyl in 1986, after
increasing radiation prompted the government to widen the
evacuation zone and aftershocks rocked the country. Copper lost
as much as 2.7 percent. Tin, zinc and aluminum all declined,
while gold, which with platinum accounts for a fifth of  South
Africa ’s export earnings, also fell.  Fukushima Dai-Ichi’s rating was increased to level 7 from 5
on the global scale, the same as the 1979 partial reactor
meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.  Anglo American slipped the most since May, dropping 16.69
rand, or 4.6 percent, to 348.81 rand.  BHP Billiton  retreated the
most since March 10, losing 8.55 rand, or 3 percent, to 278.55
rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
