Rwanda ’s central bank kept its key
lending rate unchanged, after three reductions in the past year,
as it seeks to boost lending growth to support the economy’s
expansion.  The Policy Interest Rate was maintained at 6 percent,
National Bank of Rwanda Governor Francois Kanimba said in a
statement handed to reporters today in Kigali, the capital.  Rwanda’s  Finance Ministry  has forecast economic growth in
the coffee-growing East African nation will slow to 7 percent
this year from 7.5 percent in 2010 as poor rains curb
agricultural production.  To achieve that rate of expansion, the central bank is
projecting a “significant increase” in growth in credit to the
private sector this year to 19.7 percent from 11.1 percent in
2010, Kanimba said.  Outstanding credit to the private sector grew 4.7 percent
from December to February and preliminary March data indicates
“further sustained growth,” he said.  The central bank revised its inflation forecast for the
year after price-growth accelerated to 2.56 percent in February
from 1.09 percent in January as food, education and
communication costs increased.  “Our annual inflation assumption by the end of December, if
these trends continue, probably will be in the range of 8
percent,” Kanimba said. The central bank said in February it
expected inflation to be contained at 6 percent “maximum” in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
