SAP AG (SAP) , the world’s largest maker
of business-management software, is “looking for
opportunities” to fuel growth, though it won’t make an
acquisition just to increase market share, Co-Chief Executive
Officer Jim Hagemann Snabe said.  “We don’t believe it’s a viable long-term solution to buy
market share in an industry that requires innovation,” Snabe
said in an interview with Bloomberg television in  London  today.
“We believe in a strategy to move us forward and not
consolidating the past.”  Snabe and Co-CEO Bill McDermott agreed to acquire Dublin,
California-based Sybase Inc., a maker of database and mobile
computing software, in May last year, three months after they
replaced  Leo Apotheker  at the helm. Apotheker is now CEO of
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  At $5.8 billion, Sybase was SAP’s second-
largest acquisition. The biggest was the purchase of business
intelligence company Business Objects for 4.8 billion euros
($6.9 billion) in 2007.  McDermott said he is “relatively optimistic about the
macro-economic environment.”  “CEOs need to execute their strategy and run their
business, and companies are getting used to operating in
volatile times,” McDermott said. “Volatile times are not an
excuse to not execute your strategy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
