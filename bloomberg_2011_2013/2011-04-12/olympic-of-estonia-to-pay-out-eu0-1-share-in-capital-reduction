Olympic Entertainment Group AS (OEG1T) , the
only publicly traded casino operator in eastern  Europe , proposed
a payout of 10 euro cents per share from two share capital
reductions.  Olympic will reduce its share capital by a total of about
15 million euros ($21.8 million) to 81.7 million euros by making
monetary disbursements to shareholders, the company said in a
regulatory statement today. Part of the capital reduction is due
to the conversion of share capital into the euro from Estonian
kroon, it said.  The company said yesterday it wonâ€™t pay a dividend for 2010
as it has no retained earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
