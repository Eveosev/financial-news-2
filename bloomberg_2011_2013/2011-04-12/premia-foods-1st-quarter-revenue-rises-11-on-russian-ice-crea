AS Premia Foods, the largest Baltic
frozen-food producer, said first-quarter sales rose 11 percent,
helped by its purchase of a Russian ice-cream producer in May.  Revenue increased to 16.6 million euros ($24.1 million)
from 15 million euros from a year earlier after ice-cream sales
more than doubled following Premiaâ€™s acquisition of OOO
Khladokombinat No. 1, the Tallinn-based company said in a
regulatory statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
