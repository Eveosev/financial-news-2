China  is committed to deliver on
its pledge to lower the carbon intensity of its economy by 40
percent by 2020 compared with 2005 levels, said Ding Zhimin,
deputy director general of the Policy and Law Department at the
National Energy Administration.  She made the comments at a conference in Brussels during
the EU Sustainable Energy Week.  “China is the largest energy-producing country and the
second-largest energy-consuming country.”  “In the near future we will probably become number one in
energy consumption. In terms of clean energy it occupies 20
percent of the electricity produced in China. So we see that we
are successful in reducing energy consumption and we also reduce
CO2 emissions.”  “We have implemented 10 different projects to reduce
energy consumption as a way to deal with climate change. These
projects aim to promote energy efficient products for the
benefit of our people.”  “We also put into practice national action plan on climate
change in terms of making public architecture more efficient. We
also have a very specific way to monitor the progress dealing
with climate change.”  “We know that the road ahead is long and arduous, but
we’re committed to deliver on the promise so by 2020 we will
reduce 40 percent of CO2 emissions as compared with 2005.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
