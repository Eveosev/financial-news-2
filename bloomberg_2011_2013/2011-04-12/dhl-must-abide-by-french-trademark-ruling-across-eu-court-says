Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ’s DHL Express unit
must abide by the terms of a French trademark ruling throughout
the 27-nation European Union, the region’s highest court said.  A decision by a national court that DHL Express’s French
unit breached the trademark rights of a rival “extends as a
rule” to the entire bloc because it was acting as EU trademark
court, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled today,
according to a statement.  The DHL unit lost a trademark dispute in 2007 against  La
Poste ’s express delivery service Chronopost in a ruling by the
Paris appeals court. The French tribunal said that DHL Express
had breached Chronopost’s EU trademark rights for the name
“Webshipping” by using the same word for online courier
services.  France ’s top court  sought  the EU tribunal’s guidance in
June 2009 on whether such a ruling is valid across the EU or
only in France.  Joerg Wiedemann, a spokesman for DHL’s Express division,
declined to comment.  The case is C-235/09, DHL Express France SAS v Chronopost
SA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
