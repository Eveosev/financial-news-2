U.S. Senate Energy Committee
Chairman Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, said he is
“reasonably optimistic” an energy bill would pass Congress.  High gasoline prices are helping to push energy to the
forefront of policy discussions in Congress, Bingaman said today
at an energy conference in  Washington  sponsored by The New
Republic. Companies worried about maintaining U.S. leadership in
clean-energy markets are also pushing for a bill, Bingaman said.  “We have a lot of things we are polarized about in
Congress these days,” Bingaman said. “This area of energy is
one where we ought to be able to develop enough of a consensus
to move ahead.”  The energy committee will look to advance bills to overhaul
federal regulations in response to last year’s BP Plc’s  oil
spill , reduce the cost of transportation fuels, increase
electricity production from non-polluting sources and boost
energy conservation efforts, Bingaman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
