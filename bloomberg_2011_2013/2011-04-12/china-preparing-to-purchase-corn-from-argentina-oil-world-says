China  will probably buy 1 million
to 2 million metric tons of corn from  Argentina  for shipment in
June and July, Oil World said.  A purchase would mark the first Argentine corn exports to
China in “recent years,” the Hamburg-based researcher said in
a report today. Diversifying supply is in China’s interest
because of “tightness” and high prices for the grain in the
U.S., it said. A Chinese delegation was in Argentina recently
preparing for the purchases, according to Oil World, which
didn’t say where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
