  General Electric Co. (GE)  said a
European Union emissions price of 70 euros ($101.60) a metric
ton is needed to make  carbon-capture  systems viable.  GE Energy  has developed a kit that strips carbon from coal
before it is burned, a process known as pre-combustion carbon
capture. The method produces a stream of hydrogen gas that is
then burned to produce electricity.  “The technology is available,” Ricardo Cordoba, president
GE Energy Western Europe, North Africa, told reporters at a
briefing in Brussels. “We know how to burn hydrogen, which is
coming from the gasification of the coal. The problem is cost.
Today you cannot compete, you will have nobody investing.”  Carbon capture technology also needs “social acceptance,
even if it is totally safe,” Cordoba said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
