Tigo Energy Inc. , a maker of solar
panel management technology, expects revenue to increase
fivefold by the end of the year and raised funds to expand its
production capacity.  Tigo received $10 million from a fund managed by venture
capital company Generation Investment Management LLP, the  Los
Gatos , California-based company said today in a statement.  The company also arranged a $10 million  credit line  against
receivables from Farmington, Connecticut-based  Horizon
Technology Finance Corp. (HRZN) , Jeff Krisa, Tigo’s vice president of
marketing and sales, in an interview.  Tigo expects to double revenue every quarter through the
end of the year, Krisa said, and will increase its manufacturing
capacity from about 10 megawatts-equivalent a month now to 40
megawatts a month by the end of the year.  “All prospects look like we’ll continue to double over the
balance of this year, which requires a fairly substantial set of
working capital to keep up with that run rate,” he said.  Tigo introduced in July 2009 its  Module Maximizer , which
increases power output of individual solar panels and collects
system performance data.  The $10 million in equity capital came from London-based
Generation’s Climate Solutions Fund LP. Tigo’s other backers
include Matrix Partners, OVP Venture Partners, Israel Cleantech
Ventures and IDB Holding Corp.’s Clal Energy.  Inventec Appliances Corp, a Taiwan-based contract
manufacturer, produces the Module Maximizers and is also a Tigo
investor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
