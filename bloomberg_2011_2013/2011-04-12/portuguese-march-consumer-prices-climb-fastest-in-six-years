Portugal ’s consumer price index
rose 3.9 percent in March from a year earlier, the most in at
least six years and up from 3.5 percent the prior month.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
rose 1.6 percent from February, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said today in an e-mailed statement.  Using the institute’s own methods, consumer prices rose
4 percent from a year earlier and 1.6 percent from February.
Excluding energy and unprocessed food, prices rose 2.4 percent
from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
