The Australian and New Zealand
dollars will extend this yearâ€™s gains into the third quarter as
the U.S. currency is likely to weaken because the  Federal
Reserve  is reluctant to increase interest rates, Royal Bank of
 Scotland  said in a report.  The so-called Aussie may peak at $1.10 by Sept. 30, then
decline to 98 U.S. cents by the end of 2012, Greg Gibbs, a
Sydney-based RBS strategist, wrote in the report. The New
Zealand currency is likely to climb to 84 U.S. cents in the
third quarter and slide to 77 cents by the end of next year, he
wrote.  The Australian dollar traded at $1.0462 as of 8:30 a.m. in
Sydney and the kiwi was at 78.46 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
