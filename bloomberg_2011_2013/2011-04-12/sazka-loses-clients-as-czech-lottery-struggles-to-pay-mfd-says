Sazka ASâ€™s clients are cutting back
on placing bets after the  Finance Ministry  said the bankrupt
Czech lottery is struggling to pay overdue winnings,  Mlada
Fronta Dnes  reported, citing the company.  Sazka received 12 million koruna ($707,460) in wagers for
its Nedelni Sportka game on April 10, down from more than 50
million koruna for the Sunday game at the end of last year, the
Prague-based newspaper said, citing numbers provided by the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
