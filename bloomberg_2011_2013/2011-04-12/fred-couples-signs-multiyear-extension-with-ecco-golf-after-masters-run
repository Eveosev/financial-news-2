Fred Couples  signed a multiyear
extension with Ecco Inc., two days after the 1992 Masters
Tournament champion finished 15th at golf’s first major event
of the season.  Couples, 51, will continue to compete in U.S.  PGA Tour  and
over-50 Champions Tour events wearing the Denmark-based
company’s Golf Street style shoes and be featured in its
marketing, Ecco said in a news release.  Ecco first signed Couples in 2006. Financial terms of the
latest contract weren’t disclosed.  At last year’s Masters, Couples played in Ecco’s spikeless
Street style shoes and finished sixth. After his performance,
the 45-year-old closely held company said it shipped 24 times
more of the $140 shoes than it had anticipated in 2010 and sold
out for the first six months of 2011.  Couples finished this year’s Masters at 4-under-par 284, 10
strokes behind champion Charl Schwartzel.  Other companies, including Fortune Brands Inc.’s Foot-Joy,
Taylor-Made Golf Co.’s  Ashworth , Puma AG, and  Canada ’s  Kikkor 
Golf have since followed with their own casual-style golf shoes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
