President William C. Dudley said regulators worldwide should set
higher  capital requirements  for “large, global, systemically
important financial institutions” and improve their
coordination to foster financial stability.  “We need this to reduce the risk of failure of such
institutions to very low levels because we do not yet have the
tools in place to resolve these institutions on a cross-border
basis in a non-disruptive manner,” Dudley said in the text of a
speech given in  Hong Kong  today. “Although we have made some
progress in making the global financial system safer and more
secure, there is much more to do.”  Dudley said regulators must work to ensure a “relatively
level playing field” among countries so that companies don’t
move operations to areas with weak oversight. His remarks were
similar to those given in  Tokyo  yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
