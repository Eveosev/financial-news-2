The  Miami Heat  won last night to
capture second place in the National Basketball Association’s
Eastern Conference ahead of the  Boston Celtics .  LeBron James scored 34 points in the 98-90 victory in
Atlanta. The win means the Celtics start at home against the  New
York Knicks  in the playoffs, and the Heat will host the
Philadelphia 76ers.  In Washington, Celtics coach Doc Rivers rested Paul Pierce,
Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Rajon Rondo as his team lost 95-94
to the Wizards. The 76ers lost to the Orlando Magic.  In the Western Conference, the Dallas Mavericks took sole
possession of second place ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers after
beating Houston 98-91.  Germany’s Dirk Nowitzki scored 23 points for the Mavericks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
