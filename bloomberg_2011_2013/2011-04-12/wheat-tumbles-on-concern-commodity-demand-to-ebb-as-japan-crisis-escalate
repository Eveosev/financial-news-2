Wheat futures tumbled the most in
four weeks on speculation that demand will decline for U.S.
commodities after the nuclear crisis escalated in  Japan .  Japan, the second-biggest buyer of U.S. wheat last year,
raised the severity rating of its nuclear crisis to the highest
level after more earthquakes struck the country and radiation
from a damaged power station increased. The Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of 19 raw materials fell the most in four weeks as
U.S. Treasury bonds rose.  “We’re seeing some safe-haven buying come back into  U.S.
Treasuries , and wheat’s getting shortchanged, given the crop
conditions we have,” said Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global
Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana .  Wheat futures for July delivery slid 39.5 cents, or 4.7
percent, to settle at $7.9225 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, capping the biggest drop since March 15.
Before today, the price had gained 9 percent this month as dry
weather in the U.S. Great Plains threatened developing crops.  Japan was struck by two earthquakes stronger than magnitude
6 today, hindering recovery efforts as workers were temporarily
evacuated. The March 11 quake and tsunami left 27,500 dead or
missing, according to Japan’s  National Police Agency .  The U.S. is the world’s leading wheat exporter. Nigeria was
the biggest buyer last year.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
