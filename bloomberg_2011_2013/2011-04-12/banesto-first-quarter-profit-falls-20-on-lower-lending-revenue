Banco Espanol de Credito SA (BTO) , a
retail-banking unit of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said first-quarter
profit declined 20 percent as lending revenue slumped.  Net income fell to 169.5 million euros ($244 million) from
211.5 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based company
said in a filing to regulators today. That beat the average 149
million-euro estimate in a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.  Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez last
week told the country’s banks to “strive to defend their bottom
line” as lending contracts and margins are squeezed by higher
funding costs and low  interest rates . Banesto, the first Spanish
bank to report first-quarter earnings, said it cut operating
costs and reined in loans newly entered into default even as
real-estate assets on its books kept rising.  “It’s a bit of a mixed picture with some positive signs
emerging but still with elements of uncertainty about the
outlook,” said Daragh Quinn, an analyst at Nomura International
in  Madrid , who rates Banesto “buy.”  Banesto shares fell 0.1 percent to 6.67 euros in Madrid,
paring this year’s gain to 7.6 percent and valuing the lender at
4.58 billion euros.  Net interest income fell 11 percent to 380.4 million euros
from a year earlier while lending shrank 2.8 percent 73.5
billion euros. Margins stabilized in the quarter, Banesto said.  Bad Loans  Costs for covering loan impairments rose 3.5 percent to
91.7 million euros, and bad loans as a proportion of total
lending climbed to 4.15 percent from 4.08 percent in December
and 3.12 percent a year earlier.  Net entries into default plunged to 27 million euros from
180 million euros a year ago as the bank said it recovered more
unpaid loans and booked fewer gross defaults. The bank’s total
bad or doubtful bad loans shrank to 3.49 billion euros from 3.54
billion euros during the quarter.  Banesto ran down a “generic” or secondary buffer of
reserves set aside to cover bad loans to 101 million euros from
549 million euros a year ago, the bank said. Total provisions of
1.86 billion euros cover 53 percent of bad loans, down from
coverage of 61 percent a year ago.  The bank said it had 2.42 billion euros of doubtful and
substandard real-estate loans. That represented 29 percent of
its lending to the industry compared with 21 percent a year ago.  Banesto said the amount of foreclosed or otherwise real
estate on its books climbed to 3.12 billion euros from 2.95
billion euros in December and 2.33 billion euros a year ago. It
has set aside provisions of 24 percent of that amount to cover
losses, the bank said.  Banesto’s core capital ratio stood at 8.6 percent at the
end of March, compared with 8.3 percent three months earlier. It
aims to reach a level of 9 percent by the end of this year, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
