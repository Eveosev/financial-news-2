Gold tumbled the most in four weeks
after a drop in energy costs reduced demand for the precious
metal as a hedge against inflation. Silver also fell.  Crude-oil futures in New York have plunged almost 6 percent
in two days after the  International Monetary Fund  cut growth
estimates for  Japan  and the U.S. Gold rose to a record of $1,478
an ounce yesterday as tensions in Libya, Japan’s nuclear crisis
and concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will spread boosted demand
for an investment haven.  “Seeing the oil market come down has taken some of the
wind out of the inflationary forces that drove commodities to
records,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “Some of the inflationary trade
has come out of the metals.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell $14.50, or 1 percent,
to settle at $1,453.60 at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
the biggest drop since March 15. Yesterday, the metal slid 0.4
percent. The price has gained 25 percent in the past 12 months.  Oil dropped as much as 4 percent today. Yesterday, the
commodity declined 2.5 percent after reaching a 30-month high of
$113.46 a barrel.  “Gold and silver are getting dragged down by crude,” said
 Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
LLC in Chicago. “Crude is making a deflationary run.”  German investor confidence fell more than economists
forecast in April after the  European Central Bank  raised
 interest rates  to curb inflation, the ZEW Center for European
Economic Research in Mannheim said today.  ‘Inflation Fears’  Japan increased the severity rating of its nuclear crisis
to the highest level, matching the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.  “A lowered outlook for growth has led many to conclude
that inflation fears are unwarranted, thereby reducing demand
for precious metals as a hedge,” Marc Ground, an analyst at
Standard Bank Plc in Johannesburg, said today in a report.  Silver and palladium also fell the most since March 15.  On the Comex, silver futures for May delivery fell 54.6
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $40.066 an ounce. Yesterday, the price
reached $41.975, the highest since January 1980, when the metal
touched a record $50.35. The commodity has more than doubled in
the past year.  Palladium futures for June delivery dropped $18.15, or 2.3
percent, to $770.10 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. The metal has gained 47 percent in the past year.  Platinum futures for July delivery declined $18.50, or 1
percent, to $1,774.30 an ounce. The metal dropped 1.1 percent
yesterday. The price has climbed 2 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
