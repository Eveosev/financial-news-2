Copper fell for a second day from a
five-week high as  Japan  battled more earthquakes and aftershocks
and continuing radiation leaks from a stricken nuclear plant.
Zinc, lead and tin also declined.  Three-month-delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
lost as much as 1 percent to $9,753 a metric ton and was at
$9,757 at 2:24 p.m. Singapore time. The contract, which reached
$9,944.75 a ton yesterday, the highest price since March 4, also
declined after the  International Monetary Fund  cut its economic
forecasts for the U.S. and Japan, and as Alcoa Inc.’s sales
trailed estimates.  “Investors have been reined in by more earthquakes in
Japan and a reminder that the nuclear crisis there is not
over,” Fan Haibo, an analyst at Cinda Securities Co., said from
Beijing. “It’s a good excuse to take profit after the strong
rally, against the backdrop of ongoing economic uncertainties.”  Japan’s nuclear crisis was raised to the highest level of
severity, matching Chernobyl’s rating, as worsening radiation
from the damaged Dai-Ichi plant prompted the government to widen
the evacuation zone and as aftershocks rocked the country.  A magnitude-6.3 earthquake struck the Fukushima prefecture
today, following a magnitude-6.4 temblor earlier, a 6.6-
magnitude earthquake yesterday and a magnitude-7.1 aftershock on
April 7. Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister  Kaoru Yosano  said
the March 11 earthquake may result in a larger hit to the
economy than previously seen.  Nuclear Crisis  May-delivery copper on the Comex in  New York  dropped as
much as 0.6 percent to $4.4345 a pound, extending the biggest
drop in a week yesterday. The metal for June delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange fell for the first time in five days,
dropping as much as 1.4 percent to 72,340 yuan ($11,051) a ton.  The  U.S. economy  will expand at a slower pace than earlier
predicted, the IMF said yesterday, citing higher  oil prices  and
a lackluster recovery in the labor market. The Washington-based
fund also trimmed its estimate of Japan’s growth after the
nation’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  Sales at Alcoa increased 22 percent to $5.96 billion from a
year earlier, the company said yesterday, lower than the $6.06
billion analysts in a Bloomberg survey were expecting. The
largest U.S. aluminum producer said its earnings were curbed by
a weaker dollar and higher costs of energy and raw materials.  Zinc in  London  fell 1.6 percent to $2,505 a ton, lead lost
1.4 percent to $2,816 a ton and aluminum declined 0.8 percent to
$2,667 a ton. Nickel dropped 1.4 percent to $27,330 a ton and
tin decreased 2.1 percent to $32,601 a ton after rising to a
record $33,600 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
