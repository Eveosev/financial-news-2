Bulgaria’s inflation rate advanced
in March to the highest since February 2009 as fuel and food
prices in the European Union’s poorest country rose.  The annual rate reached 5.6 percent, compared with 5.2
percent in February, the National Statistics Institute in Sofia
said today in a statement on its website. The median estimate of
five economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a rate of 6.1
percent. Prices climbed 0.6 percent in the month.  Central banks around the world are struggling to fight
inflation spurred by higher food and fuel prices. Rising global
commodity prices also pushed up costs as the country recovers
from a recession. Factory-gate prices increased an annual 12.5
percent in February, the fastest since September 2008, according
to Bloomberg data.  Bulgaria’s currency board system limits options for the
central bank to stem price growth through  interest rates .
Bulgarian policy makers are trying to lower domestic prices by
asking Lukoil Neftochim AD, the country’s dominant refinery, to
impose a one-month freeze on fuel prices.  Rising inflation will hinder household consumption and
erode economic growth this year,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, said in a March 31 report.  The government forecast annual inflation at 3.6 percent
this year, after overshooting last year’s target of 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
