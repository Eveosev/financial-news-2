The judge overseeing the
liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff’s defunct investment firm
maintained the seal on  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s banking practices
while ordering the public disclosure of some names in lawsuits
seeking to claw back profits.  Trustee Irving Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 suits
seeking $100 billion for the conman’s investors, said last month
there was no “compelling reason” why names of key people in
his complaints should be blanked out. The unsealing was
requested by the New York Times Co., WNBC-TV, NBC News and CNBC.  “The public has a qualified First Amendment right to
access certain judicial documents,” U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
 Burton Lifland  said in a written order filed in Manhattan today,
citing previous cases. At the same time, bankruptcy law protects
 trade secrets  and confidential research, he said.  JPMorgan, sued for $6.4 billion by Picard, had asked the
judge to guard the confidentiality of information about the New
York-based bank’s so-called know-your-customer program and anti-
money laundering procedures.  In ordering some names unsealed in some lawsuits, Lifland
said “the defendants have not adequately established any harm
beyond merely ‘embarrassing or prejudicial’ association with
these Ponzi scheme proceedings, which is not sufficient for
sealing.”  The JPMorgan case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 10-
ap-4932,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
