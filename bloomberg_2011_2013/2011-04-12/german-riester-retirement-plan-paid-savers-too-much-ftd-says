Germany ’s Riester retirement plan
paid 1.5 million savers 500 million euros ($720 million) in
subsidies to which they weren’t entitled and now have to pay
back, the  Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing unidentified
officials from the federal fund.  Government-subsidized Riester plans, named after a former
labor minister, count among Germany’s most popular private
savings plans with 14 million policies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
