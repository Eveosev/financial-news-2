The U.S. government this year may
shut down 100 of the 800 data centers it wants to close by 2015,
the federal chief information officer told a Senate subcommittee
today.  “We’ve already identified over 100 data centers that
agencies” can shutter this calendar year, Vivek Kundra, who is
heading the consolidation initiative, said today at a hearing of
the federal financial management and government information
subcommittee.  The government also is making progress on an initiative to
move agency systems to cloud computing, a shared pool of
computing resources such as servers and data storage, Kundra
said. Agencies have identified 75 computer systems that can be
moved to the cloud and are hiring companies to do the work, he
said.  Data-center consolidation and cloud computing are key
elements in Kundra’s plan to reduce government technology
spending, which totals almost $80 billion a year. Kundra has
said about $20 billion in technology spending could be moved to
the cloud.  To contact the reporter on this story:
