seventh time in eight days on forecasts of moderating weather

probably test the $4 level again,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker with Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “The next month is going to be telltale as the
market looks for strong injections into storage.”  Natural gas for May delivery fell 1 cent to settle at

according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 3:11 p.m. in New

show a larger-than-normal injection into gas inventories last
week after mild weather in the major gas-consuming regions,
according to the median of eight analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Gas Supplies  The department may report that 34 billion cubic feet of gas
were added to storage in the week ended April 8, compared with
the five-year average increase of 28 billion.  Stockpiles in last week’s report totaled 1.579 trillion
cubic feet, 0.6 percent above the five-year average.  “Unfortunately, sub-$4 gas should be commonplace this
summer as strong refills fuel fears that gas could test physical
storage capacity,” analysts including  Cameron Horwitz  at
Canaccord Genuity in Houston wrote in a note to clients today.  Demonstrated peak working gas capacity  was 4.049 trillion
cubic feet as of April 2010, according to the Energy Department.
