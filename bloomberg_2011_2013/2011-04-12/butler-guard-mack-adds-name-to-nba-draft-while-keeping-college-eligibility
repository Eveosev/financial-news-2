Butler University junior guard
Shelvin Mack will declare for the National Basketball
Association draft but not hire an agent, keeping his college
eligibility as he considers his options, the school said on its
website.  Mack averaged 20.3 points per game during the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament as the Bulldogs
reached the championship game for the second-straight year,
losing to the  University of Connecticut . He was the second-
leading scorer on the team during the regular season, averaging
16 points.  Mack has until May 8 to withdraw his name from the draft
and retain his college eligibility.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
