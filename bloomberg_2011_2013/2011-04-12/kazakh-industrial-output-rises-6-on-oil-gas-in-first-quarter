Kazakh industrial production rose 6
percent from a year earlier in the first quarter, driven by
increases in oil and natural gas output.  Central Asiaâ€™s biggest energy producer pumped 20.4 million
metric tons of oil in the quarter, 3.6 percent more than in the
same period last year, the State Statistics Agency said today in
an e-mailed statement from Astana. Gas production rose 6.5
percent to 10.2 billion cubic meters.  Copper and ferroalloys production both rose 0.1 percent.
Copper output reached 81,900 tons, and ferroalloy production
grew to 400,000 tons, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
