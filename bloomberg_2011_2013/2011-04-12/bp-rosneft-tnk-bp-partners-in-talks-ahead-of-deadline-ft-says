BP Plc held a second day of talks
with its Russian billionaire partners in TNK-BP and OAO Rosneft
yesterday, as the U.K. oil group continues its attempt to
salvage its share-swap deal with Russian state-controlled
Rosneft before an April 14 deadline, the Financial Times
reported, citing people familiar with the situation.  The U.K. oil group called off the TNK-BP board meeting
planned for today, the FT said, without saying where it got the
information.  Rosneft’s former chairman, Russian Deputy Prime Minister
 Igor Sechin , who stepped down on April 11, is still involved in
the talks, the Financial Times said, citing people familiar with
the situation. Rosneft is “still keen” for the agreement with
BP to go through, the people familiar with the situation said,
according to the FT.  BP, Rosneft and the Russian partners in TNK-BP declined to
comment, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
