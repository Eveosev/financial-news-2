BP Plc (BP/)  plans to ship a very large
crude carrier of North Sea Forties crude to Chile, according to
tanker reports obtained by Bloomberg News.  The supertanker Harad is scheduled to load crude oil from
Hound Point, Scotland, the loading terminal for Forties, on
April 21 and sail to Chile at a cost of 55 Worldscale points,
the reports from shipbrokers including Athens-based Optima
Shipbrokers Ltd. showed. A VLCC typically holds 2 million
barrels of crude oil.  Robert Wine , a London-based spokesman for BP, declined to
comment.  Forties crude is usually loaded onto smaller tankers. So
far this year, only one VLCC has been used to move Forties out
of the region. The Elektra Glory sailed to the U.S. Gulf of
 Mexico  after loading Forties last month, according to AISLive
vessel-tracking data on Bloomberg.  Forties is one of the four North Sea oil grades used to
price Dated Brent, the benchmark for two-thirds of global oil
supply. The others are Brent, Oseberg and Ekofisk.  Worldscale points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or
flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a metric ton, are revised
annually by the Worldscale Association in  London  to reflect
changing fuel costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
