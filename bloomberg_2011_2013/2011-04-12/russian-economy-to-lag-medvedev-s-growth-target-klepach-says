Russia’s economy will probably
expand this decade at half the rate sought by President  Dmitry Medvedev , Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said.  Gross domestic product may rise 4.5 percent to 5 percent
annually through 2020, Klepach told reporters today in Kiev. The
Economy Ministry this week cut its growth forecast to 3.5
percent next year, compared with 4.2 percent in 2011.  Russia needs to outperform developed economies and grow 8
percent to 10 percent annually to keep up with its so-called
BRIC peers, Brazil, India and  China , Medvedev said in January.  The countries, which meet periodically with  South Africa ,
will seek to form a “common position” during a summit in China
this week for talks with the Group of 20 nations, Arkady Dvorkovich, the president’s economic adviser, said today.  Russian policy makers shouldn’t switch to inflation
targeting “in the foreseeable future” and need to focus
instead on managing the ruble rate, Klepach said, adding the
economy isn’t yet ready for a freely traded currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
