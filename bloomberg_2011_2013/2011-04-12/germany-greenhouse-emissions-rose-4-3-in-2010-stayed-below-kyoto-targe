German greenhouse-gas emissions
rose 4.3 percent last year to 960 million metric tons as
 Europe ’s largest economy recovered and were still below the
country’s ceiling under the climate-protection Kyoto Protocol.  Germany ’s 2010 discharges were 23.1 percent lower than in
1990, the baseline year under the United Nations emissions-
reduction treaty, the Federal Environment Agency said today in a
statement. The country’s target under the protocol is a 21
percent reduction in 2008-2012, translating into an average
annual limit of 974 million tons of  greenhouse gases  including
carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.  Last year’s emissions of carbon dioxide, blamed by
scientists for global warming, rose 5.4 percent to 831.5 million
metric tons, according to the agency.  “The steep increase in CO2 emissions is mainly a result of
the economic recovery and the cold weather,” it said. “The
expansion of renewable energies in 2010 compared with the
previous year allowed a savings of nine million tons of CO2.”  The cold weather last year boosted the use of coal and
natural gas for heating, according to the agency. Additionally,
the growth of steel production by 34 percent last year
translated into higher coal consumption.  Methane emissions dropped 1.1 percent to 48.3 million tons
last year while discharges of nitrous oxide declined 3.9 percent
to 64.3 million tons, the agency said.  Discharges of hydrofluorocarbons, used in refrigeration and
air conditioning, increased 1.3 percent to 12.1 million tons in
2010 and emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, used mainly in
insulation and protective glass, were 6.7 percent higher at 3.4
million tons. Perfluorocarbons, also monitored under the  Kyoto
Protocol , were unchanged at about 400,000 tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
