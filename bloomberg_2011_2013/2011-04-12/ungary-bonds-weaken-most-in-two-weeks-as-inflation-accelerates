Hungary’s longest-dated bonds fell
the most in more than a month after inflation accelerated more
than expected in March.  The slump in the bonds due in 2028 lifted the yield 10
basis points to 7.13 percent at 4:53 p.m., the biggest increase
since March 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The inflation rate rose to 4.5 percent from 4.1 percent in
February, the statistics office in Budapest said today. The
median estimate of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 4.2
percent. Policy makers, who decided unanimously last month to
keep the two-week deposit rate at 6 percent for a second month,
will next meet to vote on rates on April 18.  “A significant upward surprise could lead to some
temporary underperformance in long-dated bonds,” strategists at
BNP Paribas SA including Elisabeth Gruie in  London  wrote in a
research report before the inflation data was released.  The forint depreciated 0.6 percent to 266.75 per euro, the
weakest intraday level since April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
