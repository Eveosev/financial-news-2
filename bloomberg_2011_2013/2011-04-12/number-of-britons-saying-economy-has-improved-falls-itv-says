The number of Britons who say the
economy has improved over the past quarter fell this month as
households see their finances squeezed, according to a ComRes
Ltd. survey carried out for ITV News.  Thirteen percent of 2,030 respondents in the study said
they believed the U.K. economy improved over the last three
months, compared with 17 percent a month earlier, London-based
ITV said in an e-mailed statement today. About 56 percent said
it had deteriorated, the survey found.  The report showed 10 percent said their personal financial
situation is now better than three months ago, with 52 percent
saying they are worse off, ITV said.  ComRes carried out the survey between April 8 and April 10.
