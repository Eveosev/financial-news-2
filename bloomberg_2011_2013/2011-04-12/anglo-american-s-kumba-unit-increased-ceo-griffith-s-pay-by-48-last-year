Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO) , a unit of
 Anglo American Plc (AAL) , increased the compensation of Chief
Executive Officer Chris Griffith by 48 percent last year as
profit surged.  Griffith received 6.5 million rand ($971,000), up from 4.4
million rand a year earlier, according to Kumba’s  annual report 
posted on its website today. That includes a 4 million-rand
salary, 2.05 million-rand short-term cash bonus and other
benefits. Lazarus Zim, who resigned as chairman on Dec. 14, was
paid 1.1 million rand.  Kumba’s profit more than doubled in 2010 to 14.3 billion
rand as rising Asian demand for  iron ore  pushed up prices for
the steelmaking material. Anglo owns about 65 percent of the
Pretoria, South Africa-based company, the world’s fourth-largest
supplier of seaborne iron ore. Kumba, which gained 39 percent in
Johannesburg trading last year, is valued at about $23 billion.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , valued at about $21 billion,
paid CEO Andrew Forrest $233,996 in the fiscal year ended June
30, including salary, bonus and share-based payments, according
to its annual report. Commercial Director Russell Scrimshaw got
$1.85 million. Profit at the company, Australia’s third-biggest
iron ore producer, rose 14 percent to $581 million that year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
