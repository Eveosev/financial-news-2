Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a one-month low, after a central bank survey showed
economists cut their year-end inflation forecasts.  The yield on the benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020
fell 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.11 percent
at 2:03 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s stock
exchange. That’s the lowest level on a closing basis since March
16. The bond’s price rose 0.182 centavo to 118.303 centavos per
peso.  Economists lowered their predictions for year-end inflation
to 3.31 percent in a central bank  survey  published today, from
3.48 percent in the March survey. The central bank targets
inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent this year.  “The market has been adjusting its inflation expectations
downward,” said Pedro Ospina, an analyst in Bogota at
Interbolsa SA, the nation’s biggest brokerage. “People are
calmer regarding inflation and that helps inject dynamism to”
peso bonds, he said.  The gap between yields on government inflation-indexed
bonds due 2013 and similar-maturity fixed-rate debt, a gauge of
annual consumer price increase expectations known as the
breakeven rate, fell to 320 basis points today. That’s its
narrowest since Dec. 6 and compares to 473 on Jan. 7.  Colombia’s peso fell for the first day in six, weakening
0.1 percent to 1,819.43 per  U.S. dollar  from 1,817.35 yesterday.
The peso has advanced 2.8 percent in the past month, the second-
best performance after the Brazilian real among six Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
