Japanese stocks fell the most in
almost a month after the  International Monetary Fund  cut the
economic growth forecast for the country and strong aftershocks
continued to shake Tokyo following a record quake and tsunami.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. tumbled the most on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) 
Stock Average after the utility said radiation leaks from
reactors crippled by last month’s disaster may eventually exceed
those from Chernobyl.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co.
fell after SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. said supply disruptions
may reduce profits at the carmakers by billions of dollars.
 Inpex Corp. (1605) , the country’s No. 1 energy explorer, slumped 5.2
percent as  oil prices  dropped.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.7 percent to 9,555.26 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, while the Topix index slipped 1.6 percent to
838.51. Both gauges dropped the most since March 15. Stocks
extended losses following an aftershock in the last hour of
trading and after  Japan ’s nuclear regulator said the accident at
the Fukushima reactors was worse than it previously stated.  “Investor sentiment is deteriorating because it seems
uncertainty is going to remain for a long time,” said Ikuo Mitsui, who helps manage $270 million at Vivace Capital
Management Co. “There’s concern about how disruptions to
Japan’s supply chain will affect the global economy.”  Aftershocks, Reactors  The Nikkei dropped as much as 2.1 percent after a magnitude-
6.3 earthquake struck Fukushima prefecture at 2:07 p.m., shaking
buildings in Tokyo more than 200 kilometers to the south. The
temblor followed a magnitude-6.6 aftershock that hit yesterday,
a month after the March 11 disaster that left 27,493 dead or
missing and disabled  Tokyo Electric ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant. Yesterday’s aftershock stopped cooling systems at the
damaged power station for 50 minutes.  Tokyo Electric, which is battling to lower temperatures at
four crippled nuclear reactors, plunged 10 percent to 450 yen.
Shares rose as much as 7.8 percent after Reuter’s reported that
the government isn’t considering nationalizing the utility,
citing Tadahiro Matsushita, Japan’s Vice Minister of Economy,
Trade and Industry.  Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency raised its
severity rating of the Fukushima accident to the highest level
of 7, which matches the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The accident
was previously rated 5 on the global scale, the same as the 1979
partial reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island in  Pennsylvania .  Nikkei Valuations  Japan’s Nikkei has lost 8.4 percent since March 10, the day
before the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that devastated
Japan’s northeast coast. Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are
valued at 14.3 times estimated earnings on average, compared
with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600.  Toyota slid 0.6 percent to 3,240 yen, while Honda dropped
1.4 percent to 2,862 yen after SMBC Nikko Securities slashed
profit estimates for Japan’s top two carmakers, citing parts
shortages and reduced output.  Shotaro Noguchi, a senior analyst at the brokerage in Tokyo,
said Toyota’s operating profit for the year ending March 2012
will fall to 310 billion yen ($3.68 billion) versus an earlier
prediction of 900 billion yen. Honda’s profit may drop to 460
billion yen, compared with an earlier estimate of 670 billion
yen, Noguchi said in a report that followed a downgrade of
Japan’s auto sector by Citigroup Inc. yesterday.  Crude Slides  U.S. stocks and crude prices fell yesterday after the IMF
cut its estimate for growth in the U.S., the world’s biggest
economy and the largest oil consumer. In  New York , the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.3 percent to 1,324.46. S&P 500
futures slid 0.5 percent today.  An index that includes energy-related shares slid the most
among the Topix’s industry groups after crude prices fell. Inpex
retreated 5.2 percent to 620,000 yen.  Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. (1662) , the second-biggest oil driller, dropped 3.5
percent to 4,010 yen.  Oil for May delivery tumbled from a 30-month high, dropping
2.5 percent to settle at $109.92 a barrel in New York yesterday.  The  U.S. economy  will expand 2.8 percent this year, slowing
from 2.9 percent last year and falling short of a January
forecast for 3 percent growth in 2011, the IMF said. The
Washington-based institution also cut its estimate of Japan’s
growth to 1.4 percent from 1.6 percent after the nation’s
earthquake and tsunami.  Shimadzu, which makes measuring instruments and precision
tools, dropped 4 percent to 670 yen after Mizuho Securities cut
the company’s investment rating to “neutral” from
“outperform,” saying last month’s earthquake will likely slow
demand for measuring equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
