More than half of the serving
members of  Turkey ’s parliament were dropped from their party’s
candidate lists before June 12 elections,  Milliyet  newspaper
reported.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  dropped 56 percent of
his current lawmakers, while opposition leader  Kemal Kilicdaroglu  retained only 37 of his 101 deputies on the
Republican People’s Party’s candidate list, the Istanbul-based
newspaper said.  Erdogan moved prominent candidates including Finance
Minister Mehmet Simsek, Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul, Tourism
Minister Ertugrul Gunay and Transport Minister Binali Yildirim
to coastal and eastern regions where his party’s votes have been
relatively low, Milliyet said.  All of Erdogan’s six deputies representing the Kurdish city
of Diyarbakir were switched with the exception of Agriculture
Minister Mehdi Eker, Milliyet said. Erdogan’s list is 14 percent
female, while 20 percent of Kilicdaroglu’s candidates are women.  To contact the reporter on this story:
