A missing statue of King
Tutankhamun has been returned to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo,
along with three other objects lost during the revolution that
toppled  Hosni Mubarak  from power, an Egyptian minister said.  A small part of the crown on the gilded wooden statue of
Tutankhamun standing on a boat is missing, as well as pieces of
the legs,  Zahi Hawass , minister of state for antiquities, said
in an e-mailed statement today. The king will be reunited with
the boat, which is still in the museum, and restored, he said.  Among the objects returned was a gilded bronze and wooden
trumpet of Tutankhamun, which is in excellent condition and will
be returned to its display immediately, Hawass said. A fan
belonging to the king was also returned, though part of it has
been broken into 11 pieces. A shabti statue of Yuya and Tjuya
was also returned to the museum and will be placed on display
again immediately.  The Egyptian Museum issued a final list in March of more
than 50 ancient artifacts, including three gilded wooden statues
of King Tutankhamun, which went missing after looters broke into
the building in Cairo during anti-government protests in
January.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
