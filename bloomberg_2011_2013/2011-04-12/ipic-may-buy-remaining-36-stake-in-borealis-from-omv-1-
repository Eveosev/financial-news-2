International Petroleum Investment
Co., an  investment company  owned by  Abu Dhabi , may buy the
remaining 36 percent in Borealis A/S from Austria’s  OMV AG. (OMV)   “There’s always a possibility of that,” Chief Executive
Mark Garrett told reporters today at an event in Abu Dhabi when
asked whether IPIC, holder of 64 percent, planned to acquire the
rest of the plastics maker.  “There currently are no talks in this direction,”
 Michaela Huber , a spokeswoman for OMV in Vienna, said by phone.
IPIC Managing Director Khadem Al Qubaisi didn’t answer a call
and text message to his mobile phone seeking comment.  OMV’s 36 percent stake may be valued at about 1 billion
euros ($1.5 billion), according to Philipp Chladek, an analyst a
Raiffeisen Centrobank AG in Vienna. Chladek rates OMV a “buy.”  Borealis is focused on  Europe  for acquisitions in companies
specializing in ammonia, urea, ethylene, and propylene, said
Garrett, adding there haven’t been advanced talks yet. “We will
fund acquisitions from existing cash,” he said.  The long-term aim of Borealis is an initial public
offering, OMV Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss told
reporters on March 31, adding that nothing concrete was being
planned.  IPIC holds a 20 percent stake in OMV, central Europe’s
biggest oil company. The stake is held in a voting consortium
with Austria, which owns 32 percent of OMV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
