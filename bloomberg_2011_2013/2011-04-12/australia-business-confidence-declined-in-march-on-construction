Australian business confidence
declined in March, led by weakness in retail and construction
industries, a private report showed.  The confidence index dropped to 9 from 14 in February,
according to a  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  survey of more than
410 companies from March 25-31 and released in Sydney today. The
business conditions gauge, a measure of hiring, sales and
profits, gained to 9 from minus 2 a month earlier, the highest
level in a year, today’s report showed.  The survey results reflect an economy recovering from a
slowdown in January, when floods in Queensland state undermined
confidence, NAB said.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens is relying on lower household spending and higher
savings to balance an economy where a mining investment boom
helped drive unemployment below 5 percent.  The economy likely “stalled in the March quarter because
of the floods and cyclone; coal exports were still weak in
February,” NAB Chief Economist  Alan Oster  said in a statement.
“Survey conditions improved sharply quarter-end and may signal
expected recovery from mining investment, flood reconstruction
and income effects of commodity prices.”  Floods in Queensland in December and January affected about
30,000 properties, shut coal mines, cut rail lines and damaged
crops.  Oster forecasts the central bank will raise  interest rates 
by a quarter percentage point in August and again in November,
taking borrowing costs to 5.25 percent. It will be prepared to
“pre-empt any unanticipated cost pressures,” he said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
