The U.S. and U.K. today welcomed
the adoption of new European Union sanctions against human
rights violators in Iran.  The “tough” sanctions impose travel bans and asset
freezes on 32 individuals in the Iranian regime “we believe to
be are responsible and instrumental” for Iran’s “appalling
human rights record,” U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said
at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg today, according to
a statement from his office.  In  Washington ,  Jay Carney , the spokesman for U.S. President
 Barack Obama , said the sanctions are an “important reminder”
to Iran that the Tehran government will be held responsible for
abuses it commits against the Iranian people.  “The United States calls on Iran to respect and protect
the universal rights of its citizens,” Carney said.  A U.S. State Department report on human rights released
April 8 said Iran pursued a campaign of violence and
intimidation against its own people in 2010, committing
extrajudicial killings and using amputation and flogging as
punishments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
