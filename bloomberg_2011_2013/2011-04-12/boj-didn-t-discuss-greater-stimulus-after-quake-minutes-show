Bank of Japan  officials refrained
from discussing any specific stimulus measures beyond the 5
trillion yen ($59 billion) in additional asset purchases they
unveiled three days after the nation’s record earthquake,
minutes from a March 14 meeting show.  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his board agreed “the bank
would continue to carefully examine the outlook for economic
activity and prices, and if judged necessary, take policy
actions in an appropriate manner,” according to minutes from
the meeting published today in  Tokyo .  The central bank doubled the size of its asset-purchase
plan to 10 trillion yen at the gathering, after injecting a
record amount of cash into markets earlier that day. It unveiled
a 1 trillion yen lending program to help companies in quake-
stricken areas at last week’s policy meeting, when it also cut
its economic assessment for the first time since October.  Many board members expressed concern about the
deterioration of confidence among businesses and households
because of electricity shortages after the quake, the minutes
showed. Some members said investors may become more risk averse
after the disaster.  Some members said the economy will get boost from
reconstruction demand, though it was “highly uncertain” when
and how large those projects would be. The magnitude-9 temblor
and tsunami left more than 27,000 dead or missing, according to
 Japan ’s  National Police Agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
