The Syrian government allowed local
insurance companies to buy treasury bills yesterday in a an
attempt to attract more investors, Finance Minister Mohammad Al-
Hussein said.  "We want to widen and diversify the base of bidders,"  Al-
Hussein told reporters in Damascus today. "Treasury bond
auctions were previously restricted to local banks."  Syria  started selling bonds for the first time in December
to finance development projects. The country canceled a 1
billion Syrian-pound ($21 million) sale of one-year notes on
March 16 as investors sought higher yields amid turmoil in the
region.  The Arab country plans to sell 30 billion pounds in
treasury bills this year, the Ministry of Finance said Jan. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
