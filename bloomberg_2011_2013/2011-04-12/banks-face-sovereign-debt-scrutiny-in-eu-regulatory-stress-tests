European regulators will scrutinize
banks’ calculations for losses on sovereign debt held to
maturity when carrying out this year’s stress tests,  Europe ’s
top banking supervisor said.  Financial watchdogs will “check what banks are doing with
reference to some sovereign exposures and see whether they’re
taking a conservative attitude” when valuing the assets, Andrea Enria, the chairman of the  European Banking Authority , said in
an interview in  London .  Ninety banks will be expected to maintain a Core  Tier 1
capital  ratio of at least 5 percent under the stress-test
scenarios, the EBA said.  Portugal  last week became the third
euro-area state after Greece and Ireland to succumb to the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis and request emergency aid.  “I understand on contacts I’ve had with banks that some of
them have already reviewed the valuations of sovereign exposures
on the banking book towards certain countries,” Enria said.
Banks hold on to bonds in the banking book until the principal
is scheduled to be repaid, rather than trading them on the
secondary market.  This year’s tests will include a review of how banks would
handle a 0.5 percent economic contraction in the euro area in
2011 as well as a 15 percent drop in European equity markets.  The EBA tests will also examine the effect of a 75 basis-
point-jump in  interest rates  on European sovereign bonds and an
increase in short-term inter-bank financing costs of 125 basis
points.  ‘Weaknesses’  Banks that fail the stress tests will have until the end of
the year to complete plans to recapitalize or restructure their
business, Enria said.  If an institution is found to have “weaknesses in terms of
its risk modeling, you intervene as a supervisor, you must
act,” Enria said. “This isn’t less important to us than
raising capital.”  Enria said lenders with flawed risk models that pass the
exams may also be required to address EBA questions.  “Guess what, given all the accountants and lawyers in the
room, you can game a static capital buffer,” James Babicz, head
of risk at business analytics company SAS U.K., said in a
telephone interview. “Risk is unmeasurable by its definition.”  Enria said he may allow some banks more time to submit
results because lenders will be measured against stricter
capital standards than last year. The EBA will aim to publish
the results of the exams at the end of June.  Submission Deadline  Germany ’s Bundesbank and financial regulator BaFin called
for the stress-test information submission deadline to be
extended by two weeks. The original deadline was the end of
April.  “If some banks cannot manage, then we’ll be flexible in
terms of deadlines,” Enria said.  Regional German banks, including Norddeutsche Landesbank
and Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen, have complained that the EBA’s
tighter definition of capital may lead to some lenders failing
the exams.  Lenders won’t be allowed to use some types of non-voting
capital permitted by German bank supervisors, known as silent
participations, to calculate the results.  “There are a lot of other instruments in the capital of
European banks in other countries that got less attention but
have exactly the same features,” Enria said. “There will be
pain for banks in almost all countries.”  At least five banks were added to the list of those
examined last year. Ireland’s Irish Life and Permanent Plc,
 Norway ’s DnB NOR Bank ASA, Nykredit Bank from  Denmark ,
Slovenia’s Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor and Oesterreichische
Volksbank AG from  Austria  will be tested for the first time.  Core Tier 1, as defined by global regulators in the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision , largely consists of banks
common stock and retained earnings. The 2010 tests were
conducted against a pass rate of six percent Tier 1 capital,
which encompasses a broader range of securities including hybrid
instruments such as preference shares.  To contact the reporter for this story:
