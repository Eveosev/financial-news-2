China Telecom Corp., the
country’s biggest fixed-line phone carrier, fell the most in
 Hong Kong  trading in almost a year after Pacific Crest
Securities cut its investment rating on the stock.  China Telecom dropped as much as 5.8 percent, the
steepest intraday decline since April 29. The shares traded
at HK$4.93, down 5 percent, as of 11:23 a.m. in Hong Kong.  The phone carrier’s rating was lowered to “sector
perform” from “outperform” by Pacific Crest’s Steve Clement, the top China Telecom analyst over the past year
according to the Bloomberg Absolute Return Rank.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
