Ukrainian lender PAO First
Ukrainian International Bank posted a record net income last
year after a loss during 2009, when the global crisis put the
former Soviet republic into recession.  The bank, known as FUIB, had a $54.4 million in 2010,
following a $54.3 million net loss a year earlier, it said in an
e-mailed statement today in Kiev.  Last year “created a basis for future growth,” said FUIB
Chief Executive Officer Kostyantyn Vaysman in the statement.  First Ukrainian will continue to merge its operations with
PAO Dongorbank and aims to win no less than a 5 percent share of
the domestic banking market by 2014, Vaysman said. The bank will
focus on retail banking in the coming years, he said.  The lender may sell about $100 million worth of hryvnia-
denominated bonds in the second half of 2011, said deputy Chief
Executive Dmytro Yurgens, at a news conference today in Kiev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
