(Corrects to remove options maturity in second paragraph.)  Investors should buy bearish
options on companies depending on  consumer spending  because
purchasing will be reduced by rising energy costs and using the
contracts as insurance is inexpensive,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  said.  Equity derivatives strategist Sivan Mahadevan recommended
buying puts to sell consumer companies that sell necessities
including  Sara Lee Corp. (SLE) ,  Clorox Co. (CLX)  and  Campbell Soup Co. (CPB) , and
on companies reliant on consumersâ€™ discretionary spending such
as  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  and  American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO)   To contact the reporter on this story:
