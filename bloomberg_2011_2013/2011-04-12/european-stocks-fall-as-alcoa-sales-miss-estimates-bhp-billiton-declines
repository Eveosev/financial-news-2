European stocks and U.S. futures
slipped after Tokyo Electric Power Co. said its earthquake-hit
nuclear power plant may release more radiation than Chernobyl
and Alcoa Inc. posted sales that missed analysts’ estimates.
Asian stocks also retreated.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, led
mining stocks lower as metal prices fell. Fraport AG, the owner
of Frankfurt Airport, slid 1 percent after saying passenger
numbers decreased.  Game Group Plc (GMG)  slumped 5.6 percent after UBS
AG cut its recommendation on the shares.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.8 percent to 278.81 at
8:06 a.m. in  London . The gauge retreated yesterday after a
magnitude-6.6 aftershock struck Japan a month after the nation’s
biggest earthquake on record and subsequent tsunami left about
27,500 dead or missing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
