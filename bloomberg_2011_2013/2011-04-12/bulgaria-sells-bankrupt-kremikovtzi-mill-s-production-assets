Bulgaria  sold the production assets
of the bankrupt  Kremikovtzi AD (4KW)  steel mill in a fourth auction
after cutting their initial price by 44 percent to 316 million
lev ($233.2 million).  The mill was placed in receivership in 2008 after failing
to pay investors holding 325 million euros ($469 million) of
bonds. Attempts to sell it to ArcelorMittal and Ukrainian
billionaire Konstantin Zhevago three years ago failed, prompting
the Sofia City Court to declare it bankrupt.  The mill was sold to Eltrade Company EOOD, Tsvetan Bankov,
the factory’s receiver, told reporters in Sofia today. Eltrade
paid a 31 million lev deposit before the auction and pay the
balance of the full price by April 18, Bankov said.  “This is good news for all involved,” Krassen Stanchev,
chief executive officer of the KC2 consultancy firm and a former
adviser for some of the bondholders, said by phone. “If
properly managed, Kremikovtzi can generate net income of some 20
million euros a year for the next four years by processing
scrap.”  Eltrade was registered as a metals trading firm in Sofia on
March 8 with capital of 20,000 lev, according to Bulgaria’s
Trade Registry. The company’s founder, Lachezar Varnadjiev, 26,
declined to comment on how he is going to develop the assets.  Production Assets  The production assets, which also include a rail transport
network and the electricity and natural gas distribution grids
serving the plant, were initially priced at 565.42 million lev
in the first auction on Sept. 13.  The plant, built in the 1960s, shut coke and metals output
in May 2009. It was previously owned by Pramod Mittal, the
younger brother of  ArcelorMittal (MT)  Chief Executive Officer  Lakshmi Mittal .  The plant’s remaining assets, valued at about 300 million
lev, which include some 300 service apartments, lands and mines,
are being sold at separate auctions, Bankov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
