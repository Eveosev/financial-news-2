Ethanol futures tumbled the most in
four weeks, dropping with crude oil and gasoline amid concern
that higher energy prices will curb economic growth.  The alternative fuel shadowed other commodities lower after
the  International Energy Agency  and the  International Monetary
Fund  said  oil prices  that have surged 25 percent in the past
year will hurt the global economy. Ethanol is part of U.S.
energy plans to reduce reliance on crude oil.  “The market’s got overextended,” said Mike Blackford, an
analyst at INTL FCStone Group in  Des Moines , Iowa. “It’s enough
to cause a bit of a washout this week. Demand is hand-to-mouth.
People are only buying as needed.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery slumped 7 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $2.66 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
largest decline since March 15 and the lowest price since March
31. Prices have risen 12 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 5
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.735 a gallon and in  Chicago  the
additive lost 3.5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.66, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in New York fell 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.75
a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel decreased 3.5 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $2.805.  Crude oil for May delivery declined $3.67, or 3.3 percent,
to $106.25 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
lowest settlement since March 30. Prices have tumbled 5.8
percent since April 8, the biggest two-day retreat since May 14
and 17, 2010.  Gasoline for May delivery slipped 3.64 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $3.1641 a gallon on the exchange, The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are earning 11 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in Illinois are making 15 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
