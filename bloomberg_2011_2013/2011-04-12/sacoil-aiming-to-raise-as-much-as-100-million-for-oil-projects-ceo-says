SacOil Holdings Ltd., the oil and
gas explorer, is considering raising as much as $100 million in
an equity offering to accelerate the development of its projects
in  Nigeria , Chief Executive Officer Robin Vela said.  “We want to acquire production and we have to have capital
to do that,” he said by phone from London today. “We’d like it
to happen before the end of the second quarter this year to
expedite the work we want to do.”  SacOil wants to speed up development of its projects in
Nigeria after selling part of its stake in an exploration block
in the Democratic Republic of Congo to  Total SA. (FP)  The South
African company, which is already listed on JSE Ltd., started
trading shares on London’s Alternative Investment Market on
April 8 to increase its exposure to European investors.  The company didn’t raise money upon listing in  London  and
is keeping the offer below $100 million because it doesn’t want
“to dilute our shares too much,” Vela said. “We want to do it
now because the markets seem to favor it.”  SacOil and its partner in Nigeria, Energy Equity Resources
Ltd., have a 40 percent stake in the offshore block 233 operated
by Nigdel United Oil Co., which could start production in mid-
2013 at a rate of 10,000 barrels per day.  The joint venture also has a 40 percent stake in block 281,
operated by Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc, which has an
estimated recoverable resource of as much as 100 million barrels
of oil equivalent.  Shares in SacOil fell for a third day, declining 8 cents,
or 4.3 percent, to 1.78 rand as of 11:44 a.m. in Johannesburg,
curbing the gain since the start of the year to 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
