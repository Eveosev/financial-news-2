“The  Oprah Winfrey  Show” is
seeking $1 million for 30-second commercials during the
program’s May 25 finale, according to Horizon Media Inc., a New
York-based advertising company.  At that price, the advertisements would set a record for a
nonsports daytime broadcast, Brad Adgate, director of research
at Horizon, said today in an e-mail.  Oprah Winfrey is departing her afternoon talk show, which
is distributed by  CBS Corp. (CBS) , to focus on a cable channel she
started with  Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) , based in Silver
Spring, Maryland. The 24-hour Oprah Winfrey Network began in
January with programs including “The Gayle King Show,” “The
Judds,” “Kidnapped by the Kids” and “Addicted to Food.”
Comedian Rosie O’Donnell will start a show after August.  “The final episode of ‘Oprah’ -- in fact the final weeks
of ‘Oprah’ -- will be a TV event,” Leslie Ryan, a CBS
spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail. CBS, based in  New York ,
declined to comment on the $1 million asking price, she said.  Lisa Halliday, a spokeswoman for Harpo Inc., Winfrey’s
Chicago-based production company, didn’t respond to requests for
comment. The ad rate was reported April 4 in Brandweek magazine.  CBS, owner of the most-watched U.S. television network,
fell 13 cents to $24.31 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have gained 28 percent this year.  “Lost,” on  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC broadcast network,
commanded $900,000 for 30-second commercials during its May 23,
2010 finale, said Horizon Media, citing data from Nielsen Co.
and Kantar Media.  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox charged $650,000 for ads the
next day for the finale of “24.”  Highest-Priced Finales  Finales of some prime-time scripted shows have commanded
higher ad rates, according to Horizon. NBC’s “Friends” drew $2
million per 30-second commercial in 2004 and the network’s
“Seinfeld” got $1.42 million in 1998, the company said. CBS’s
“Everyone Loves Raymond” reached $1.22 million per commercial
in 2005, according to  Horizon Media .  “Like the Super Bowl or the finales of ‘Friends’ or
’Frasier,’ advertisers are always anxious to be part of event
shows and the huge ratings they garner,” Ryan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
