Iceland’s economic recovery is
unlikely to be derailed by voters’ rejection of a depositor
claims accord with the U.K. and the Netherlands, Danske Bank A/S
said in a report published today.  Gross domestic product may grow about 3 percent to 4
percent in the next two to three years and the inflation rate is
likely to remain within the central bank’s 2.5 percent target
through 2013, Danske Bank said.  Economic “growth could surprise on the upside if certainty
about the Icelandic funding situation increases,” Danske Bank
Chief Analyst Lars Christensen said in the report.  The economy will probably expand 2.9 percent this year, 3.3
percent in 2012 and 3.7 percent in 2013, Danske Bank estimates.  Purchasing power parity indicates the krona is undervalued
by about 25 percent against the euro onshore, Danske Bank said.
The currency may be undervalued “much more” offshore,
Christensen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
