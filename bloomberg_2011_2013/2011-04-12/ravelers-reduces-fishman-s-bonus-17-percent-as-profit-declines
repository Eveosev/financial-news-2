Travelers Cos., the insurer added
to the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  in 2009, cut Chief Executive
Officer Jay Fishman’s bonus to $6.25 million after claims from
catastrophes weighed on results last year.  Fishman’s total compensation for 2010 declined to $20.4
million from $20.6 million a year earlier, the New York-based
company said yesterday in a filing. His bonus fell 17 percent
from $7.5 million while stock awards rose to $6.61 million from
$3.75 million a year earlier.  Net income fell to $3.22 billion in 2010 from $3.62 billion
a year earlier as costs tied to catastrophes, such as hailstorms
in  Arizona  and flooding in  Tennessee , more than doubled.
Industrywide, insurers’ losses from natural disasters in 2010
surged 90 percent to $38 billion from $20 billion a year
earlier, according to Chicago-based insurance broker  Aon Corp. (AON)   Fishman, 58, helped Travelers maintain profits through the
credit crisis and recession by putting the company’s fixed-
income investments in municipal bonds, avoiding losses from
mortgage-backed securities that hobbled competitors including
American International Group Inc. Travelers held about $39.5
billion of municipal debt at the end of December, according to
regulatory filings.  Travelers declined 73 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $59.69
yesterday in regular New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
It has climbed 7.1 percent this year, compared with a 5.9
percent gain for the Dow Jones index.  Disaster-Related Costs  Catastrophes cost the insurer $729 million after tax in
2010, compared with $297 million a year earlier, according to a
Jan. 25 statement from Travelers.  Fishman was awarded $5.25 million in options for 2010,
compared with about $7.13 million a year earlier. His salary was
$1 million. The increase in value of his pension contributed
$614,889 and other compensation was $688,541.  Chief Financial Officer Jay Benet’s total compensation fell
to $5.94 million from $6.03 million in 2009. Chief Operating
Officer Brian MacLean earned $7.19 million in 2010 after making
$7.31 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
