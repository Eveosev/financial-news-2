German bund futures may decline to
118.39 should they break below a key support level, UBS AG said,
citing technical indicators.  “Bunds are bearish while they trade below 120.54,”
 Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy at UBS
in London, wrote in a research note today. That’s the mid-point
of last week’s sell-off, Adcock wrote.  “As long as this remains the case, the expectation is for
limited bounces and further price weakness,” he wrote.  The bund contract expiring in June gained 0.3 percent to
120.24 as of 10:02 a.m. in London. It fell to 119.86 yesterday,
the lowest since Sept. 22, 2009.  “A break below Monday’s 119.86 low will be the next
bearish trigger, exposing the market to the long-term 38 percent
retracement at 119.77 and then the April 2010 low at 118.39,”
he said.  The 119.77 level represents the 38 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the rally from June 2008 to August 2010, he
added.  A support level is an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate orders to buy a security to be grouped. A resistance
level is an area where they anticipate sell orders to be
clustered. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices
rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
