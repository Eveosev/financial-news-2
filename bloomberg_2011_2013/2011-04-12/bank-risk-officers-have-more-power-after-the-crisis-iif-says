Bank chief risk officers have more
power after the global financial crisis as lenders implement
strategies to avoid past mistakes, the Washington-based
 Institute for International Finance  said.  Almost 90 percent of bank executives said the role of risk
officers has been strengthened since the crisis, according to
the survey of 62 financial services companies that Ernst & Young
conducted for the IIF. The IIF is a lobbying group that
represents more than 400 financial institutions worldwide.  “The power and authority of chief risk officers and their
teams has been elevated, notably in such key areas as business
strategy and planning, risk appetite definition and management,
product development and compensation,” the IIF said today in a
statement.  More than 80 percent of respondents said bank board members
have increased their oversight of risk, and 93 percent of
respondents said they have implemented new internal stress
tests, up from 74 percent in 2009, according to the survey.  “Regulation is important, but it has in itself seldom, if
ever, averted a banking crisis,” Rick Waugh, chief executive
officer of  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  and vice chairman of the IIF,
said in the statement. “What really counts, along with strong
supervision, is good risk governance and sound risk management
in firms.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
