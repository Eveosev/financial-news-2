EWE AG said its Riffgat offshore
wind park has been delayed by about half a year and will start
in 2014 at the latest after uncertainty over the facility’s
location on the German-Dutch border, Chief Executive Officer
Werner Brinker said today at a press conference.  While the northern German utility plans to keep a 30
percent stake in the wind park, Brinker said he can’t comment on
EWE’s partners on the project as their supervisory boards still
need to approve an agreement they reached with the company in
coming days, according to a webcast of the event.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
