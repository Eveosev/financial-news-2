A Soviet space capsule that orbited
the Earth 50 years ago fetched $2.9 million at  Sotheby’s  in  New
York  today, setting a record for a space ship.  The buyer was Yevgeny Yurchenko, chairman of the Moscow-
based investment fund AS Popov, one of only two phone bidders in
a packed room that included schoolchildren.  The price surpassed the low end of the lot’s presale
estimate of $2 million to $10 million.  The auction was held on the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin’s historic flight, which marked the first time a human
being traveled into outer space.  The Vostok 3KA-2 was the capsule used in the final test
before Gagarin’s flight on April 12, 1961. It carried a life-
size cosmonaut mannequin and a live dog, and landed safely two
hours after launch in a snow-blanketed field about 700 miles
from Moscow.  Scorched and scratched on the outside, it is now a giant
rusty ball. Most of the interior was taken up by an ejection
seat.  Sotheby’s (BID)  offered the test capsule in 1996, with an
estimate of $800,000 to $1 million. It didn’t sell and was later
acquired privately by an anonymous U.S. businessman directly
from the Russians, according to Sotheby’s.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
