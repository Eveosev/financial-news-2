Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the worldâ€™s
biggest private-equity firm, agreed to form a joint venture with
natural-gas explorer Alta Resources LLC to invest $1 billion in
North American gas fields.  The entity will be called Alta Energy Partners, the
companies said today in a joint statement. The new company will
focus on acquiring leases and drilling wells in so-called
unconventional fields, or geologic formations previously
regarded as too hard to penetrate.  Blackstone will invest in the venture through its affiliate
Blackstone Capital Partners, according to the statement. Alta
Resources is a Houston-based gas producer with wells from
Louisiana to Pennsylvania whose partners include George P.
Mitchell, who pioneered drilling techniques to unlock
unconventional gas deposits, according to the statement.  U.S. gas production surged 25 percent in the past five
years as explorers tapped unconventional fields in  Texas ,
Arkansas, Louisiana, Wyoming and Pennsylvania, Energy Department
figures showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
