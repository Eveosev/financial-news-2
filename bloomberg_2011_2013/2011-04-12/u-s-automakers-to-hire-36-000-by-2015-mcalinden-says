U.S. automakers will hire about
36,000 hourly and salaried workers by 2015 to meet rising
demand,  Sean McAlinden , chief economist for the Center for
Automotive Research, said today.  Employment at  General Motors Co. (GM) , Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Group LLC will rise to about 137,000 in 2015, McAlinden
said in a speech at Wayne State University in Detroit.  “Employment will rise soon because productivity levels are
still high,” McAlinden said. “We’re at such record productivity
that any additional production requires new hiring.”  The United Auto Workers union’s membership rose 6 percent
to 376,612 last year, the first gain in six years as U.S.
automakers began hiring amid a recovery in sales.  The union will negotiate new contracts with GM, Ford and
Chrysler this year. UAW President  Bob King  has said workers must
be rewarded for the $7,000 to $30,000 in concessions they each
made since 2005 to help the automakers survive. The pacts expire
in September.  Workers gave up raises, bonuses and cost-of-living
adjustments, and the UAW agreed to a two-tier wage system in
which new hires earn about $14 an hour, half the amount paid to
senior production workers. The concessions helped lower the cost
of wages and benefits at the U.S. automakers to about $57 an
hour, close to what  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  pays its U.S. workers.  “We did what we had to do to save the companies,” King said
March 22 at the union’s bargaining convention in  Detroit . “It
will take time to win back what we’ve given up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
