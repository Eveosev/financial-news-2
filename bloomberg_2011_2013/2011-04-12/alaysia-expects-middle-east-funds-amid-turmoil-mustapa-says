Malaysian International Trade and
Industry Minister Mustapa Mohamed comments on the outlook for
investment inflows from the Middle East amid the political
turmoil in parts of the region. He spoke at a conference today
in  Kuala Lumpur .  The “Middle East is an important market for trade, Islamic
finance and also tourism. I believe despite the crisis happening
in the Middle East, the source of money will continue to flow
into  Malaysia .  “Prices of oil and gas have been very high. Many countries
in the Middle East have benefited and there is ample surplus
liquidity and there are lots of funds there. There are a lot of
opportunities for them to put their money in Malaysia.”  On the ringgit’s gain:  “People have managed to adapt to the stronger ringgit and
many of them are now more confident. The ringgit being strong
and consistent is in line with the new economic model.”  The ringgit climbed 5.9 percent against the  U.S. dollar  in
the past year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
