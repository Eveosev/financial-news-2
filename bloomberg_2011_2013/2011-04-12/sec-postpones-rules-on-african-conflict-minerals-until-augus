The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said it has postponed until at least August the
adoption of new rules governing the trade in so-called
“conflict minerals” from Central Africa.  The rules, which were originally expected this month, will
require U.S. companies to disclose whether certain minerals used
in their products could have supported conflict in  Democratic
Republic of Congo , according to a draft of the rules on the SEC
website.  The commission now plans to adopt the final regulations
between August and December, according to a statement on its
website. The SEC doesn’t comment on the timing of its actions, a
commission spokeswoman said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  The SEC was tasked with formulating auditing rules for
companies that source tungsten, coltan, tin ore and gold from
Congo and its nine neighboring countries by the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed by President
 Barack Obama  in July. Mineral-rich Congo is trying to stop the
exploitation of its natural resources from supporting armed
groups in the country’s east, which has suffered more than 15
years of conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
