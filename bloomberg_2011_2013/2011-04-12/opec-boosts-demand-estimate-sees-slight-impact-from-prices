The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries raised its forecast for the amount of crude
it will need to supply this year as demand withstands the impact
of $120-a-barrel oil.  OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of global supplies, said
its 12 members will need to provide an average of 29.9 million
barrels a day this year to satisfy world demand, or 100,000
barrels a day more than estimated last month. Members have
“accommodated most of the shortfall” in output from  Libya , and
oil’s rise this month to its highest price in 2 1/2 years is
driven by fears of a shortage rather than any genuine lack of
supply, OPEC said.  “Required OPEC crude is forecast to increase,” the
organization’s Vienna-based secretariat said in its monthly
market report today. Prices are “likely to have a slightly
negative impact on transport fuel demand worldwide.”  Brent crude futures climbed above $127 a barrel yesterday
in  London  for the first time in since August 2008, as forces
loyal to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  launched strikes on the
country’s oilfields. Oil slid 2.4 percent to about $121 today.  “The market is well-supplied,” the organization said.
“Recent events alone do not justify the current high  price
levels . Instead, these represent a sharp increase in the risk
premium, reflecting fears of a shortage.”  March Output Falls  The 11 OPEC members abound by quotas produced 26.6 million
barrels a day last month, it said, down from 27.35 million a day
in January before the crisis in Libya began. Libya pumped
366,000 barrels a day in March, compared with 1.4 million a day
the previous month. The group’s total production fell to 29.31
barrels a day in March from 29.94 million barrels a day the
previous month.  Worldwide oil consumption will increase by 1.4 million
barrels a day, or 1.6 percent, this year to 87.94 million a day,
OPEC said. Earlier today the  International Energy Agency , which
advises consuming nations, maintained its outlook at 89.4
million barrels a day in its monthly report.  The IEA said that preliminary data “already show signs of
oil demand slowdown” and that prices of $100 a barrel and more
may “prove incompatible with the currently expected pace of
economic recovery.”  OPEC boosted its estimate for supplies from outside the
group this year. Non-OPEC producers will bolster output by
600,000 barrels a day to 52.8 million, an increase of 100,000
barrels a day from last month’s report.  The organization is next due to meet on June 8 in Vienna.
OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran ,  Iraq , Kuwait,
Libya,  Nigeria , Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates
and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
