German bunds stayed higher after
data showed investor confidence in  Europe â€™s largest economy
unexpectedly declined in April.  The advance pushed yields on the 10-year bond two basis
points lower to 2.47 percent as of 10:06 in  London . Two-year
note yields also slipped two basis points, to 1.89 percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict developments six months in advance, declined to 7.6
from 14.1 in March. Economists expected a drop to 11.3,
according to the median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
