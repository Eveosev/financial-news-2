China  will invest in  Spain ’s
savings-bank industry and continue buying public debt, a Spanish
government official cited Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  as telling
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero at a meeting today.  China also pledged to invest in Spanish privatizations and
increase imports from the country during Zapatero’s visit to
Beijing, said the official, who declined to be named citing
government policy. China holds 25 billion euros ($36 billion) of
Spanish debt, he said, which compares with the central
government’s total debt of 523 billion euros, according to data
from the  Treasury .  Spain is trying to convince investors it can slash the euro
region’s third-largest budget deficit while shoring up savings
banks hit by the collapse of a debt-fueled property boom. The
government tightened capital rules for lenders in February and
gave them until September to meet the new rules, prompting a
series of savings banks, known as cajas, to seek new investors.  Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  said on a visit to Madrid in
January that China would continue buying Spanish debt, as he
expressed support for measures taken by the Socialist government
to rein in spending and steer the economy back to growth after a
three-year slump.  The gap between Spanish and German borrowing costs fell to
171 basis points today, compared with 175 basis points yesterday
and a euro-era high of 298 basis points on Nov. 30 after Ireland
sought a European bailout. The spread, which averaged 15 basis
points in the first decade of monetary union, has narrowed 9
basis points since  Portugal  became the third euro member to seek
a European rescue on April 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
