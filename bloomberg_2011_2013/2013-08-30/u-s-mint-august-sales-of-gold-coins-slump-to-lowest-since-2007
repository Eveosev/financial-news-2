Sales of gold coins by the  U.S. Mint 
fell to the lowest in six years in August, retreating for the
fourth straight month.  Sales reached 11,500 ounces, according to data on the
mint’s  website . That’s the lowest since July 2007 and down from
50,500 ounces last month and 39,000 a year earlier. Coin sales
have dropped since April, when they surged to a 40-month high of
209,500 ounces as prices tumbled into a  bear market .  Gold has declined 17 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value as equities rallied
and the dollar climbed 4.8 percent against 10 major trading
partners. Prices have also dropped on concern that the  Federal
Reserve  will curb its stimulus efforts, reducing demand for
precious metals as a hedge against inflation.  “After the April surge we have not really seen that kind
of demand as the equity market and dollar look more
attractive,” Paul Kavanaugh, the director of business
development at FuturePath Trading LLC, said in a telephone
interview from Chicago.  Silver-coins  sales  dropped to 3.625 million ounces in
August, down from 4.407 million last month, the data showed.
Annual sales so far for the year stood at 33.1 million ounces
compared with 33.7 million sold in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
