A civil forfeiture lawsuit against
SAC Capital Advisors LP should be put on hold while prosecutors
continue their criminal case against the hedge fund over alleged
 insider trading , the U.S. told a federal judge in  Manhattan .  “Civil discovery would adversely affect the ability of the
government to conduct the prosecution of a related criminal
case,” prosecutors said in the filing today.  The hedge fund, which held as much as $14 billion in July,
was founded by  Steven A. Cohen , who is worth about $9 billion,
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  Prosecutors announced criminal charges against the fund on
July 25 over what they described as unprecedented insider
trading by employees as far back as 1999. That day, the
government also filed the civil suit alleging SAC engaged in
money laundering of illicit profits from the scheme by
comingling them with the firm’s capital. In that case, the
government is seeking the forfeiture of “all property, real and
personal” derived from insider trading offenses.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen
& Co., didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment
on the government’s filing.  The civil case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP, 1:13-cv-5182, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
