Poland ’s economic growth accelerated
in the second quarter as exports jumped.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.8 percent from a year
earlier, matching a preliminary estimate released Aug. 14,
according to a statement today from the Warsaw-based  Central
Statistical Office . GDP growth quickened from 0.5 percent in the
first quarter. The economy expanded 0.4 percent from the
previous three months.  The European Union’s largest eastern economy is gathering
speed as its main exports market, the euro area, emerges from
its longest-ever recession. Polish industrial output grew at the
fastest pace in 18 months in July, prompting Prime Minister
Donald Tusk to say on Aug. 20 that “slow and gradual” recovery
was “becoming a fact.”  Exports are “contributing strongly” to the improvements
in Poland’s economy, Rafal Benecki, chief economist for Poland
at ING Groep NV’s unit in Warsaw, said yesterday by phone.  The zloty gained to 4.2720 per euro as of 10:10 a.m. in
Warsaw, up 0.2 percent from yesterday. The yield on 10-year
 government bonds  fell 4 basis points to 4.448 percent.  Exports advanced 5.1 percent from a year earlier in the
first quarter,  the statistics office said. Private consumption
increased 0.2 percent after holding unchanged in the first
quarter, while fixed investment fell 3.8 percent after dropping
2 percent in the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
