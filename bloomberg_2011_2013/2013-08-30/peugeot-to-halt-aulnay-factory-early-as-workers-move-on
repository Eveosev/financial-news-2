PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest carmaker, will end auto assembly at its Aulnay
factory near Paris at the end of October, about two months
earlier than scheduled, as it lacks sufficient employees.  “We only have 20 percent of our usual workforce on the
 production line ,” Jean-Baptiste Mounier, a spokesman for the
Paris-based company, said today by phone. “About half of the
2,800 permanent Aulnay employees have found another job
internally or externally.”  Peugeot, which posted a first-half operating loss of 510
million euros ($676 million) in its automotive division, plans
to eliminate 11,200 jobs in  France  by 2015 and has said it would
close the Aulnay factory in 2014. Chief Financial Officer Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said in April that the plant may close
earlier than planned because of strikes led by the CGT union
that disrupted production.  The plant, which produces the Citroen C3 compact, was
making as few as 40 to 50 vehicles a day in April, compared with
its 250-car capacity. Peugeot reached a deal with the union in
May, ending strikes and legal action by CGT that were intended
to thwart the job cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
