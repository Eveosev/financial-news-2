Brazil ’s swap rates rose as the
economy expanded more than analysts forecast in the second
quarter, bolstering wagers that the central bank will continue
to increase borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 10.48 percent at
10:02 a.m. in Sao Paulo, bringing this week’s increase to 24
basis points. They are up 89 basis points this month. The real
advanced 0.2 percent to 2.3651 per dollar, paring its loss in
the past five days to 0.7 percent. The currency has depreciated
3.7 percent in August.  Latin America’s largest economy expanded 1.5 percent from
April to June, the most since the first quarter of 2010, the
national statistics agency said today in  Rio de Janeiro . That
gain beat all 44 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg and the median
estimate of 0.9 percent. The central bank raised its key
interest rate by a half-percentage point for a third straight
meeting to 9 percent this week and signaled the world’s most-aggressive series of increases will continue at the current pace
to keep a weaker real from fueling inflation.  “The economy is starting to feel a bit better,” Italo
Lombardi, an economist at Standard Chartered Plc, said by phone
from  New York . “It adds to the side of those who think they
will continue to hike”  interest rates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
