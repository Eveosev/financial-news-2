The premium for Chicago gasoline
rose to the highest level in more than  11 weeks  after the
second-largest refinery in the U.S. Midwest shut a unit.  The 356,000-barrel-a-day Wood River, Illinois, plant,
operated by  Phillips 66 (PSX) , idled a vacuum distillation unit
yesterday, according to a report by Genscape Inc. Decreased
furnace activity and cooling were detected on the 105,000-barrel-a-day VDU, the Louisville, Kentucky-based energy data
provider said.  Rich Johnson , a Houston-based spokesman for Phillips 66,
declined to comment on day-to-day operations.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, in Chicago
strengthened 2.5 cents to 9.5 cents a gallon above futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:41 p.m., the highest
level since June 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  gained 0.25 cent to a discount of 0.75
cent below Nymex ULSD futures.  The  Wood River refinery  receives Canadian and domestic
crudes and in large part produces transportation fuels including
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, Phillips said on its website.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , gained 64 cents to $20.42 a barrel, a fourth
consecutive advance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  same spread  in Group 3 rose 4 cents to $21.81 a barrel.
Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the midcontinent region
climbed 2.75 cents to 1 cent a gallon above Nymex futures. Itâ€™s
the first day the region has  traded above futures  since June 12.  Group 3 encompasses the area north of Tulsa, Oklahoma, to
 Minnesota  and  North Dakota .  To contact the reporter on this story:
