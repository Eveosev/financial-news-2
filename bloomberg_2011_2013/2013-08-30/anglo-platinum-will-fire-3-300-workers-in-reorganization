Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  will
fire about 3,300 workers at its South African mines, less than a
quarter of an original proposal, as the biggest producer of the
metal seeks to revive profitability.  A further 1,500 workers have applied for voluntary
severance packages, the Johannesburg-based  company  known as
Amplats said in a statement today, as it proceeds with plans to
cut output by 16 percent. About 1,600 workers will be redeployed
elsewhere in the group and 500 will pursue “other
opportunities,” Amplats said.  Platinum companies in South Africa, which has the largest
known reserves, are seeking to curb costs after prices dropped
and strikes last year led to above-inflation wage gains. Amplats
initially proposed removing 14,000 posts, revising that in May
to 6,000 after government and union objections. A further 900
head office jobs will be cut, it said Aug. 19.  “Through the course of next year we hope to start seeing
the benefits of the restructured operations coming through,”
Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith said today on a
conference call. Amplats closed 0.3 percent lower at 409.75 rand
in Johannesburg. The FTSE/JSE Africa Platinum Mining Index was
down 1.5 percent.  The company’s Rustenburg-based operations, in South
Africa’s North West province, are losing more than 1 billion
rand ($96.7 million) every six months, Griffith said. Amplats
wants to consolidate five mines with nine shaft systems into
three operating mines and reduce annual output by 350,000
ounces. Production in 2012 was 2.22 million ounces.  Reorganization Costs  The reorganization will cost Amplats 2.6 billion rand, of
which 2 billion rand will be spent in 2013, Financial Director
Bongani Nqwababa said during the call. Amplats expects savings
of 3.8 billion rand starting 2015.  A one-month notice period for those employees losing their
jobs starts Sept. 2, the  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  unit said. The
company will mitigate the effect of dismissals by temporarily
employing 1,200 workers to do mine reclamation and employing a
further 400 people in a 171 million-rand housing project.  The platinum miner will be expected to show continued
improvement in profitability in 2014,  Mark Cutifani , chief
executive of 77 percent shareholder Anglo American, said in an
interview yesterday.  Amplats needs to deliver a 15 percent return on capital, in
line with the rest of London-based Anglo American’s businesses,
Cutifani said. “If we have shafts or operations that don’t make
money, then we’ll make the tough calls,” Cutifani said.  ‘Disappointed’ Union  Amplats had 50,873 employees and 4,245 contract staff at
the end of 2012, according to its  annual report . The company’s
debt rose 26 percent in the first half of 2013 to 13.2 billion
rand as costs increased and labor unrest curbed output.  The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, the
biggest labor organization representing Amplats employees, said
it was “disappointed” by Amplats’ announcement today. The
union had expected to hear more detail on the job cuts before
the company made its statement, AMCU President Joseph Mathunjwa
said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
