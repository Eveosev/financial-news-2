A vote by U.K. lawmakers to opt out
of a possible military attack on  Syria  was “expected” and
won’t stop the U.S. from carrying out a surgical strike against
the government of President Bashar al-Assad, Burhan Ghalioun, a
Syrian opposition figure, said today.  “If after all the noise and preparations they cancel, they
will lose all credibility and then any child or any small state
will be able to attack the U.S., the international community and
even the  United Nations ,” said Ghalioun, a member of the Syrian
National Coalition, the main political opposition.  Ghalioun said the U.S. will carry out a strike “to serve
its own interests” and defend its credibility.  “We will benefit if the Free Syrian Army is ready and
knows how to take advantage of this opportunity,” Ghalioun said
by phone from Paris.  French President  Francois Hollande  said  France  is ready to
act in Syria and that every country will decide independently on
its actions in the country, according to an interview published
in Le Monde newspaper.  “There are few countries that have the capacity to act,”
Hollande said. “France is among them and is ready to do so.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
