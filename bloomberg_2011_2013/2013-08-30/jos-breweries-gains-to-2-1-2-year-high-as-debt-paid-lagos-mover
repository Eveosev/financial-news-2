(Corrects name of brokerage, trader for story published on
Aug. 30.)  Jos International Breweries Plc (JOSBREW)  rose
for a 14th day to a 2 1/2-year high after an investor helped pay
the Nigerian beermaker’s debt, opening the way for a possible
takeover, Forthright Securities & Investment Ltd. said.  The  stock  gained 9.7 percent to 2.93 naira by the close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, its highest since Feb. 22,
2011. The shares have doubled this year, compared with a 29
percent increase in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   The Plateau State government agreed to pay 700 million
naira ($4.4 million) toward writing off the company’s debt to a
local bank, Bright Otoghile, a trader at Lagos-based Forthright
Securities and Investment, said today by phone, citing
information from the state. Phone calls to the offices of Jos
and Plateau State did not connect. The brewer posted a 432
million-naira loss in 2009, according to a 2010 filing to the
Nigerian Stock Exchange.  “With the debts cleared, chances are that a major brewer
will buy into the company given the acquisitions in that sector
and the fact that other small brewers have been taken over,”
Otoghile said. It will also help with a “turnaround of the
company,” he said.  Africa’s most populous country, with more than 160 million
people, is the continent’s second-largest beer market after
South Africa, with volumes growing at an annual rate of 6
percent, according to  SABMiller Plc (SAB) , which acquired Nigeria’s
Pabod Breweries in 2009. Other brewers including  Diageo Plc (DGE)  and
 Heineken NV (HEIA)  have acquired small brewers in the West African
nation.  “The debt has been Jos Brewery’s major problem,” Otoghile
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
