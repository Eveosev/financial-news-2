The rand gained, paring its worst
monthly performance since May, and bond yields fell for the
first time in four days after private-sector credit growth
slowed more than forecast in July.  Growth in borrowing by households and companies fell for a
third month to 7.4 percent, the slowest pace since April 2012,
from 8.9 percent in June, the Pretoria-based Reserve Bank said
today. The median estimate of 13 economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for expansion of 8.6 percent. The data give more
evidence of a slowdown in Africa’s biggest economy, limiting the
central bank’s room to increase interest rates as consumer
prices climb.  “Subdued credit growth suggests that demand-driven
inflation remains in check,” Johannes Khosa, an economist at
 Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  in Johannesburg, said in an e-mail. “The
Monetary Policy Committee will continue to strike a balance
between high inflation and the still-poor economic growth
outlook by maintaining the current policy stance well into
2014.”  South Africa’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 10.3369
per dollar as of 10:48 a.m. in Johannesburg, paring its decline
this month to 4.5 percent, the most since a 13 percent slump in
May. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026
dropped seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.49
percent, crimping the increase this month to 32 basis points.  The Reserve Bank has left its benchmark repurchase rate at
5 percent since a surprise 50 basis-point cut in July 2012 to
support growth. The consumer inflation rate rose to an annual
6.3 percent in July, above the central bank’s 3 percent to 6
percent target range.  South  Africa ’s monthly trade deficit probably widened to 9
billion rand ($870 million) in July from 7.7 billion rand the
month before, a report may show at 2 p.m., according to the
median estimate of 11 economists.  Foreign investors sold a net 2.15 billion rand of South
African  stocks  and  bonds  yesterday, bringing outflows from the
nation’s debt and equity markets in the first four days of the
week to 5.22 billion rand, according to JSE Ltd. data  To contact the reporter on this story:
