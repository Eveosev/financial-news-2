Canada’s barley harvest may exceed
the government’s forecast because crops are in good condition
and ready for reaping in some areas, according to brewing-industry researcher RMI Analytics.  Production may top 9 million metric tons this year, bigger
than  Statistics Canada ’s estimate of 8.8 million tons, Lucerne,
Switzerland-based RMI said in an online  statement . The company
organized a crop tour in the Canadian province of  Alberta  on
Aug. 21-22. Crops were ready to be collected in some fields and
the harvest was about four weeks away in other areas, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
