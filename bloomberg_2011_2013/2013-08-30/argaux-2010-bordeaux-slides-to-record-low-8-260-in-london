A case of 2010  Chateau Margaux , a
Bordeaux first-growth wine estate, sold for 5,325 pounds
($8,260) on the Liv-ex market in  London , a record low and down
16 percent from its high for this year as demand weakened.  The transaction on Aug. 28 was 36 percent below its peak of
8,328 pounds a case at which it traded in June 2011 at the
height of the  bull market  for Bordeaux.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, fell 2 percent in the second quarter after gaining 7
percent in the first three months, and has slipped further since
then. A muted response to the Bordeaux 2012 sales campaign
earlier this year has sapped appetite for some other vintages as
well, while investors are comparing Bordeaux values increasingly
with those of Burgundy, Italy and  California .  “It’s not just about Bordeaux anymore,” Jeremy Peacock,
broking manager at Redhill, U.K.-based Vin-X, said by phone this
week, while noting some pick-up in trading after the recent
market drop.  The 2010 Margaux ranks as the estate’s fourth highest-priced wine of the past 30 years, lagging only those from 2009,
2000 and 1990, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex 
on its Cellar Watch website.  The vintage was awarded a 99 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , putting it among the six highest-ranked Margaux wines of the past quarter century, according to
the eRobertParker.com  website .  First Growth  Chateau Margaux, whose wines have been sold in London since
the early 18th century, was acquired in 1977 by Greek retail
magnate Andre Mentzelopoulos and has been run since his death in
1980 by his daughter Corinne.  The estate has 80 hectares (198 acres) planted with red-grape vines  Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot, Petit Verdot and
Cabernet Franc and 12 hectares planted with white Sauvignon
Blanc.  It produces an annual average 130,000 bottles of its main
wine, a similar quantity of second wine Pavillon Rouge du
Chateau Margaux and 15,000 bottles of white Pavillon Blanc,
according to its  website .  The vineyard is on the left bank of the Gironde estuary and
ranked among the top Medoc first-growth estates in the
classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris
Exhibition, which remains in force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
