Eurus Energy Holdings Corp. , a
Japanese developer of renewable-power projects, is building a
115-megawatt solar plant in Aomori prefecture in northern Japan.  The Tokyo-based company is using solar panels supplied by
 Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  and a Japanese subsidiary of U.S.
manufacturer  SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , Eurus said in a filing yesterday.  The plant at Rokkasho will start operations in November
2015, according to the statement. Eurus expects the project to
cost about 49 billion yen ($500 million), Mitsue Usami, a
spokeswoman, said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
