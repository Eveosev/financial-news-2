Iliad SA (ILD) , the French low-cost
mobile-phone carrier that has drawn competitors into a price
war, reported a 78 percent increase in first-half profit after
adding customers and boosting revenue.  Net income jumped to 141.8 million euros ($187.2 million)
from 79.6 million euros a year earlier, Paris-based Iliad, which
operates under the brand name Free, said today in a statement.
Sales gained 27 percent to 1.83 billion euros, compared with the
1.8 billion-euro estimate of analysts.  Free began service in January 2012 with packages starting
at 2 euros per month. Competitors faced with falling phone
revenue have opted to cut costs.  Bouygues SA (EN)  this week said
second-quarter profit rose 10 percent after it reduced spending.
Vivendi SA’s SFR unit has simplified its structure and
eliminated jobs as part of plans to cut expenses by 500 million
euros by the end of 2014.  Bouygues and SFR have also started talks to share parts of
their mobile networks to limit costs.  At  Orange SA (ORA) ,  France ’s former phone monopoly and still the
largest of the country’s four carriers, Chief Stephane Richard
has forecast that cost-cutting efforts will help the company
beat an initial goal of 600 million euros in savings this year.  Iliad  rose  1.1 percent to 181.50 euros at the close in
Paris. The stock has gained 40 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
