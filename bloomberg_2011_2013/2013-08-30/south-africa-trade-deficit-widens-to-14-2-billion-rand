South Africa ’s trade gap widened in
July to the biggest in three months as machinery and chemical
products imports climbed.  The  deficit  grew to 14.2 billion rand ($1.4 billion), the
most since April, from 7.7 billion rand in June, the Pretoria-based South African Revenue Service said in an e-mailed
statement today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11
economists was for a 9 billion rand shortfall.  South Africa’s trade balance is keeping pressure on the
current account, which reached a four-year high last year, and
undermines the rand. The  current-account  deficit narrowed to 5.8
percent of gross domestic product in the first quarter, while
the rand has lost 18 percent against the dollar this year, the
worst performer among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  A weaker currency should make South Africa more competitive
and some exporters are already benefiting from this, Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said in an interview on Aug. 27. The
drop in the value of the rand also boosts the cost of imports.  Imports rose 18 percent in July to 89.9 billion rand in the
month, led by a 19 percent increase in imported machinery and
appliances and 34 percent more shipments of chemical products.
Exports climbed 11 percent to 75.7 billion rand, with those of
precious and semi-precious stones and metals increasing 22
percent.  The cumulative trade deficit for 2013 rose to 89.4 billion
rand from 59 billion for the first seven months of last year.  The monthly trade figures are often volatile, reflecting
the timing of shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
