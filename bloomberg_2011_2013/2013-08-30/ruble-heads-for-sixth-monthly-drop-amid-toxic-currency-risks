The ruble headed for a sixth month
of declines as investors pulled funds from developing-nation
assets amid prospects of U.S. stimulus cuts and slower growth.  The ruble traded little changed at 38.0914 versus the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket by 2:35 p.m. in Moscow, headed
for a 0.6 decline in the month and an 8.6 percent drop since the
end of February.  Russia-dedicated bond funds lost $181 million in the five
days to Aug. 28, their 14th week of outflows, OAO Gazprombank
said today, citing EPFR Global data. The U.S. Federal Reserve
will begin to slow its debt purchases at a Sept. 17-18 meeting,
according to 65 percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey
conducted this month. Russia’s current-account surplus decreased
to $6.9 billion in the second quarter from $25.1 billion in the
first quarter. Brent oil fell 0.1 percent to $115.03 a barrel.  The ruble has weakened due to “a toxic combination of
risks related to policy tightening in the U.S., a slowdown in
 China  and domestic reasons, mostly related to the structural
deterioration in the balance of payments,” Vladimir Kolychev,
economist and strategist at OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  in Moscow, said in e-mailed comments.  The Economy Ministry forecasts the current-account surplus
in 2013 will decline to $26 billion from $75 billion in 2012.
The ruble was little changed against the dollar at 33.2550 and
steady versus the euro at 44. The yield on the government’s
ruble debt due February 2027 fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 8.02 percent.  Possible Outperformance  “The same combination of external risks is likely to
prevail in September, but on the domestic front seasonal demand
for hard currency has likely peaked in August,” Kolychev said.
“Hence, the ruble may outperform broader emerging-market peers,
but is clearly not immune to another wave of the selloff in
emerging currencies.”  Bank Rossii raised its currency corridor 5 kopeks as of
Aug. 29, the regulator said today on its website. That’s the
sixth five-kopek shift in August. The central bank raises or
lowers the trading band as soon as accumulated interventions
reach $450 million.  Russia ’s central bank sold 13.28 billion rubles ($399
million) of foreign currency on Aug. 28, bringing the total 
spent  since May 29 to almost 446 billion rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
