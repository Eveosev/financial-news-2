Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , the
commodity trader backed by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte,
said fourth-quarter profit fell 48 percent, pressured by higher
taxes and challenging market conditions.  Net income  was S$56.8 million ($44.5 million) in the three
months ended June 30, compared with S$109.5 million a year ago,
Olam said yesterday in a statement. Revenue climbed 26 percent
to S$6.5 billion.  Olam is cutting spending and seeking to raise cash by
selling assets following a business review this year after it
was targeted by short-seller  Carson Block . The world’s second-largest rice trader in April set aside its goal to reach  profit 
of $1 billion by 2016 as it slows the pace of investments.  “We see this as a transition year and we are three months
into our strategic plan implementation,” Chief Executive
Officer Sunny Verghese said in the statement. “We remain
focused on the twin goals of pursuing profitable growth and
sustained cash flow generation.”  Olam closed 1.7 percent down at S$1.435 in  Singapore , its
lowest since Dec. 17. The stock is down about 8 percent this
year.  Tax Charges  Full-year profit slid 2.2 percent to S$362.6 million, from
S$370.9 million a year earlier, Singapore-based Olam said. That
compares with the S$361.7 million average of 15 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Full-year sales advanced 22
percent to S$20.8 billion.  With full-year earnings “being weak and next quarter being
Olam’s seasonally weak quarter, near-term catalysts might be in
short supply,” Anubhav Gupta, UBS AG analyst, said in a note
dated yesterday. “Executing the new strategy while delivering
earnings growth remains key to a re-rating,” he said. UBS has
the stock at Sell, with a 12-month target price of S$1.33.  Olam booked S$50.6 million of tax charges in the quarter,
compared with net tax credit of S$8.2 million a year earlier.
Full-year tax charges rose to S$105.1 million from S$34.1
million a year ago, due to increased business from higher tax
jurisdictions and one-time charges from selling a rice mill and
almond orchards, the company said.  Earnings were also affected by “challenging” market
conditions which emerged in the fourth quarter, Verghese said.  Olam’s coffee business was affected by an epidemic of
coffee leaf rust in Central and South America, it said. Margins
on cocoa, grains and palm trading were also lower from a year
earlier. The company also said yesterday it purchased its first
cocoa plantations by acquiring 95 percent of PT Sumber Daya
Wahana in  Indonesia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
