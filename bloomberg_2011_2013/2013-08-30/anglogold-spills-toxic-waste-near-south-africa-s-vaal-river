AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., Africa’s
largest producer of the metal, said it spilled toxic waste from
a gold-dump treatment unit into a tributary of South Africa’s
Vaal River.  The waste from AngloGold’s Mine Waste Solutions unit
entered the Koekemoer Spruit near the river on Aug. 27,  Alan
Fine , a company spokesman, said today by telephone. It “could be
detrimental to flora and fauna but not to human life,” he said.  AngloGold bought Mine Waste Solutions, which recovers gold
and uranium from mine waste, last year for $335 million from
 First Uranium Corp. (FIU/H)   An initial investigation shows thieves may have stolen
bolts from pipelines near the facility, Fine said. The spillage
“does not appear to be part of any chronic problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
