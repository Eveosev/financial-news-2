Swiss stocks  were little changed,
even as the benchmark index headed for weekly and monthly
losses, as investors awaited a report on euro-area economic
confidence.  Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) , Switzerland’s largest insurer
whose chairman quit, rose 1.4 percent.  Clariant AG (CLN)  added 0.9
percent.  Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s biggest food company, advanced
0.6 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  increased less than 0.1 percent to
7,766.72 at 9:35 a.m. in Zurich. The measure is heading for its
biggest weekly loss since November 2012 amid concern that any
military action by the U.S. against Syria may escalate into a
larger conflict. The SMI lost 0.7 percent this month. The
broader Swiss Performance Index increased 0.2 percent today.  A report at 11 a.m. in Brussels may show euro area economic
confidence rose to the highest level since March 2012. The index
of executive and consumer sentiment climbed to 93.8 in August,
from 92.5 in July, economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Data in the U.S. may show business activity in the world’s
biggest economy expanded in August. The MNI Chicago Report’s
business barometer increased to 53 from 52.3 in July, according
to the median forecast of 53 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
