Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558) , China’s
third-biggest maker of  wind turbines , reported a first-half loss
as industry growth slowed and a regulatory investigation
hampered its efforts to expand market share.  The net loss was 457.9 million  yuan  ($75 million), compared
with net income of 11.2 million yuan a year earlier, Beijing-based Sinovel said today in a filing to the Shanghai stock
exchange. Sales tumbled 55 percent to 1.39 billion yuan.  China has slowed the development of new wind farms to ease
grid congestion, intensifying competition to secure orders.
Sinovel is also subject to a probe by the China Securities
Regulatory Commission over a 2011 accounting error, which it
says hurts its ability to collect payments and add business.  The stock fell 0.5 percent to close at 4.32 yuan in
Shanghai trading before the results were released.  Sinovel forecast a loss for the first nine months of the
year, saying “unfavorable factors that affect the industry
development still continue.”  China , the world’s biggest wind market, may add 13
gigawatts of turbines this year, 6 percent less than in 2012,
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates show. Its largest turbine
makers by installed capacity are Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. and Guodian United Power Technology Co.  Sinovel was notified by the regulator in May that it would
start a probe into possible violation of securities rules. Two
months previously, the company had revised down its 2011 profit
by 22 percent to 607.4 million yuan, citing an accounting error.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
