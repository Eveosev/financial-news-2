BullionVault, a London-based online
service for investors to buy and sell physical gold and silver,
started offering storage at a vault in Toronto this month on
demand from U.S. clients to store the metals abroad.  The vault, with 2,077 ounces of gold, is expected to
attract investors who want an alternative to storing bullion in
the U.S. while still being in  North America , Adrian Ash, the
head of research, said by phone in London yesterday.  “Customer behavior has shown us over the last eight years,
that U.S. citizens and others worldwide are not that keen to
hold physical bullion in the domestic U.S.,” Ash said. “A
large number of our customers are anxious about confiscation
risk, they cite the example of 1933,” referring to the year the
U.S. government banned gold ownership.  BullionVault stores gold assets valued at about $1.4
billion in total at its five vaults. About 75 percent of its
holdings are in its Zurich vault. London is its second-biggest
storage facility, followed by vaults in  New York ,  Singapore  and
Toronto.  BullionVault has more than 48,000 customers, according to
its website.  Gold for immediate delivery fell 1 percent to $1,393.78 an
ounce by 10:45 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
