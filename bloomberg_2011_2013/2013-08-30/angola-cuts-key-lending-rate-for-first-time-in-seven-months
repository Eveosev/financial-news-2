The central bank of  Angola , Africaâ€™s
biggest crude producer after Nigeria, cut its benchmark  interest
rate  as inflation eased.  The key lending rate was lowered to 9.75 percent from 10
percent, the first reduction in seven months by the Luanda-based
Banco Nacional de Angola, according to a statement on its
website today. The bank lowered the rate by a quarter of a
percentage point in January, only the second cut since it was
introduced in October 2011.  Inflation in July was 0.52 percent, 0.11 basis points less
than June, the central bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
