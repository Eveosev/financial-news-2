India  will seek to prevent  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL)  from benefiting from a doubling in natural gas
prices by capping rates at its biggest fields, according to a
draft proposal seen by  Bloomberg News  and confirmed by two
government officials with direct knowledge of the matter.  The oil ministry has prepared a note for the country’s
Cabinet asking for approval to order Reliance to sell gas from
the D1 and D3 areas in the KG-D6 block, off the country’s east
coast, at the current price of $4.20 per million British thermal
units until a production shortfall is met or the government is
satisfied output from the area wasn’t reduced intentionally, one
of the officials said, asking not to be identified because he
isn’t allowed to speak to the media.  The Cabinet in June approved a new formula for calculating
gas prices from April 1, 2014, almost doubling rates for the
locally-produced fuel. The move prompted some political parties
to demand a review of the decision. Oil Minister Veerappa Moily
said July 11 the rates would apply to every producer in the
country.  Oil Secretary Vivek Rae, the most senior civil servant in
the ministry, didn’t answer two calls to his office seeking
comment.  Production from the D1 and D3 fields has dropped 77 percent
to about 14 million cubic meters a day from more than 60 million
in 2010, according to Reliance. The company planned a peak
output of 80 million cubic meters a day. It has said production
fell because the fields are more difficult to extract gas from
than initially estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
