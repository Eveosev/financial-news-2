Puntsag Tsagaan, one of four
Mongolian directors on Oyu Tolgoi LLC’s board, signaled his
intention to resign, website news.mn reported.  The resignation may be submitted today, the website quoted
Tsagaan as saying in an interview. Tsagaan, who joined the Oyu
Tolgoi board in June 2010, said his resignation was in line with
the completion of the first phase of the mine and the next phase
would require a new board member.  Tsagaan’s stepping down is the latest episode in the
Mongolian government’s long spat with partner  Rio Tinto  Group
over the $6.6 billion Oyu Tolgoi mine. The companies are at
loggerheads over a $5 billion project financing package to
develop the second stage of the mine.  The project financing conditions for the second stage of
the mine are “unacceptable” for Mongolia, Tsagaan said.  Earlier this month, Turquoise Hill Resources, the unit of
 Rio Tinto (RIO)  that owns 66 percent of the mine, announced it was
suspending operations on the underground part of the mine. About
1,700 workers were subsequently laid off.  The role on the board doesn’t complement his day job as
chief of staff for the Office of the President of Mongolia,
Tsagaan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
