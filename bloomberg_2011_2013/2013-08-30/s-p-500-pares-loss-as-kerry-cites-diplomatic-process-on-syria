U.S. stocks pared losses as
Secretary of State John Kerry said the nation was committed to a
“diplomatic process” with  Syria  and any potential action taken
against the nation would be limited, easing concern that attacks
were imminent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.3 percent at
1,634.09 at 1:22 p.m. in New York after sliding as much as 0.6
percent during Kerry’s speech.  U.S. intelligence agencies have “high confidence” that
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces used chemical weapons
in an Aug. 21 attack that killed at least 1,429 people,
including 426 children, Kerry said. Kerry spoke as the White
House released a public version of its intelligence assessment
about last week’s attack in the Ghouta area east of Damascus.  “Our choice today has great consequences,” Kerry told
reporters at the State Department in  Washington .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
