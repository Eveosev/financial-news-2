Hyder Consulting Plc (HYC) , the U.K.
company that helped engineer Dubai’s twin Emirates Towers, rose
to the highest in almost six years after it won a  National Grid
Plc (NG/)  framework contract for environmental consulting services.  The shares rose as much as 9 percent, and were trading up
6.9 percent at 510 pence at 10:08 a.m. in  London , the highest
price since November 2007. Trading volume was about a third of
the three-month daily average.  Hyder won all 11 lots that it bid for and “anticipates
capitalizing on a wide range of opportunities” as a result
because National Grid is investing heavily in upgrading
infrastructure, the London-based company said in a statement.
The agreement means Hyder will provide services including
environmental impact assessments and project management for
National Grid as projects arise.  “To win 11 lots shows that National Grid trust them a lot
and that they’ve got a wide range of skill capability, it’s a
nice endorsement by the National Grid,” said  Mike Allen , an
analyst at Panmure Gordon U.K. Ltd. “But the financial impact
is unclear because it’s a framework contract.” Allen recommends
that clients buy the stock and has a price estimate of 550
pence.  Eight out of nine analysts that share their ratings with
Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while one has a hold
rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
