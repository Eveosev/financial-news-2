Cinven Partners LLP, the largest
private-equity firm dedicated to investing solely in  Europe ,
said Rebecca Gibson, a partner in the consumer team, has left.  Gibson departed for personal reasons, said Vanessa Maydon,
a spokeswoman for the London-based firm. She joined Cinven from
Bain & Co. in 2002 and was promoted to partner seven years
later, working on takeovers such as U.K. hospital group Spire
Healthcare Ltd. and betting chain Gala Coral Group Ltd.  “Rebecca has made a significant contribution during her 11
years,” Maydon said. “She leaves with our very best wishes.”  Cinven earlier this month teamed up with reinsurance group
 Hannover Re  to purchase German life insurer Heidelberger
Lebensversicherung AG for about 300 million euros ($397 million)
from  Lloyds Banking Group Plc. (LLOY)  In June, it raised 5.3 billion
euros for its fifth buyout fund, the largest pool dedicated to
investing in European companies, 300 million euros more than its
initial target.  Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
plans and endowments with a mandate to buy companies within five
to six years, then sell them and return the money and a profit
after 10 years. The firms usually charge a management fee of as
much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from
investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
