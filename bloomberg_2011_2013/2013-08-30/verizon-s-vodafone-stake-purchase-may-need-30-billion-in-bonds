Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) ’s
potential purchase of the 45 percent stake held by  Vodafone
Group Plc (VOD)  in their wireless venture may be financed with as much
as $30 billion in bonds, according to Barclays Plc.  The transaction, which may total $130 billion, might be
funded with $60 billion of debt, comprised of about $20 billion
in unsecured dollar-denominated bonds, $5 billion to $10 billion
in foreign currency notes and the remainder in bank loans and
other financings, including those sold to so-called
institutional investors, New York-based analysts Danish Agboatwala and Parth Shah wrote in a report yesterday.  The $20 billion in dollar-denominated notes would be the
biggest corporate bond offering, surpassing  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s record
$17 billion deal in April to finance a $100 billion capital
reward to shareholders. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche
Bank AG led the six-part deal, which topped Roche Holding AG’s
$16.5 billion six-part transaction from February 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Verizon  deal , which would be the biggest since
Vodafone’s acquisition of Mannesmann AG in 2000, will increase
gross debt to about $112 billion, according to Barclays. The
analysts wrote Verizon’s ratio of debt to earnings may increase
to 2.4 times and result in a ratings cut to BBB+; Standard &
Poor’s grades the company A-.  Institutional investors are non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and
hedge funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
