A San Diego-based investment adviser
and his firm are facing U.S. regulatory claims that they engaged
in a cherry-picking scheme that steered winning trades to
favored clients and lied about how money was spent.  J.S. Oliver Capital Management and its president, Ian O.
Mausner, awarded more profitable trades to hedge funds in which
he and his family had invested, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement today. They also misappropriated
more than $1.1 million in soft dollars -- credits or rebates
paid by clients for trades in their accounts, the SEC said.  “Mausner’s fraudulent schemes were a one-two punch that
betrayed his clients and cost them millions of dollars,”
Marshall S. Sprung, co-chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s
Asset Management Unit, said in the statement. “Investment
advisers must allocate trades and use soft dollars consistent
with their fiduciary duty to put client interests first.”  Clients suffered approximately $10.7 million in harm from
the cherry-picking scheme, which ran from June 2008 to November
2009, the SEC said. The soft-dollar misappropriation occurred
from January 2009 to November 2011, according to the agency,
which said its investigation is continuing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
