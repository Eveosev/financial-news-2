Hog futures advanced to the highest
in two weeks on signs that demand for U.S. animals is climbing.
Cattle prices also rose.  Meatpackers processed 2.147 million hogs this week, up 0.3
percent from a week earlier and 0.4 percent more than the same
period a year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
showed today.  “We’re seeing slaughter levels pick up,” Chad Henderson,
a market analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. “That
trend will continue.”  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.3 percent to
settle at 87.625 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange after reaching 87.925 cents, the highest for
the most-active contract since Aug. 15.  Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$1.268 a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle futures for October
settlement climbed 0.6 percent to $1.5895 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
