Cocoa declined for a second day in
New York and  London  as Ivory Coast and  Ghana , the world’s
biggest producers, are forecast to get the most rain since June
this weekend. Sugar fell.  Ivory Coast and Ghana may get as much as 1.5 inches (3.8
centimeters) of rain this weekend, helping to ease dryness in
both countries, David Streit, an agricultural meteorologist at
Commodity Weather Group Inc., in Bethesda,  Maryland , said by
phone yesterday. Dry weather threatens to cut production in the
region.  “Even if the rains may not be sufficient, the forecasts
have triggered selling,” Jerome Jourquin, head of agricultural
derivatives at Aurel BGC in Paris, said by e-mail today.
“Traders have started to sell the market and speculators that
are long the market are taking profit after the recent gains.”  Cocoa for delivery in December declined 0.4 percent to
$2,468 a metric ton by 7:22 a.m. in New York on ICE Futures U.S.
Cocoa for delivery in the same month slid 0.4 percent to 1,641
pounds ($2,544) a ton in London.  The bean gained 10 percent in New York and 14 percent in
London this year on speculation the next crop will be delayed
and dry weather would reduce production. Farmers in Ghana will
gather 800,000 tons in 2013-14, down from 900,000 tons in the
current season, estimates Lome, Togo-based Ecobank.  “West African dry weather risks are still underpinning
futures,”  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
London, said in a report e-mailed today. “Rainfall forecasts
for the next two weeks are still too scanty in our view, and
insufficient to replenish depleted soil moisture levels.”  Raw sugar for delivery in October declined 0.2 percent to
16.33 cents a pound on ICE. White sugar for delivery in the same
month fell 0.5 percent to $474.30 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Rabobank International lowered its forecast for raw sugar
for the third-quarter by 0.4 cent a pound to 16.6 cents a pound
because of weakening emerging market currencies, more producer
selling and higher sugar prices over ethanol in  Brazil , the bank
said in a report today.  Arabica coffee for delivery in December was unchanged at
$1.1765 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for November
delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,769 a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
