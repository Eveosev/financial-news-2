U.K. stocks  decreased, extending the
 FTSE 100 Index (UKX) ’s monthly drop, before the release of data on
U.S. business activity and consumer spending.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  BP Plc (BP/)  slipped as oil declined
after Prime Minister  David Cameron  failed to win parliamentary
approval for military strikes against Syria.  International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  and  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  lost at least 1.7
percent.  Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment Plc (BPTY)  plunged the most
in more than two years after predicting sales will fall.  The benchmark FTSE 100 retreated 20.9 points, or 0.3
percent, to 6,462.15 at 10:31 a.m. in London, heading for a
fourth weekly drop. The gauge has decreased 2.4 percent this
month as investors weighed the prospects of reduced monetary
stimulus in the U.S. and an attack on Syria. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index also slid 0.3 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index sank 0.6 percent.  “People are sitting on cash in anticipation of things
happening” next month,  Frances Hudson , an Edinburgh-based
strategist at Standard Life Investments Ltd., which oversees
about $278 billion, said in a phone interview today.
“Seasonally, risk markets tend to be weaker at this time of the
year. Investors have been watching and waiting.”  The Federal Reserve holds a policy meeting on Sept. 17-18
to decide whether to slow the pace of its bond-purchase program.
Germany holds elections on Sept. 22, while a committee in Italy
on Sept. 9 will hear a case to decide whether the Senate should
expel ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from his seat.  U.S. Economy  Data in the U.S. today may show  business activity  in the
world’s biggest economy expanded in August. The MNI Chicago
Report’s business barometer increased to 53 from 52.3 in July,
economists predicted in a Bloomberg survey. Personal spending
climbed 0.3 percent last month, a report from the Commerce
Department may show.  Shell and BP, Europe’s biggest oil companies, retreated 0.9
percent to 2,096.5 pence and 0.9 percent to 446.65 pence,
respectively. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped as much as
1.9 percent to $106.75 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.  Cameron became the first U.K. prime minister in more than a
century to lose a motion on military action when the House of
Commons last night rejected his plan for the use of force in
Syria. The vote leaves U.S. President  Barack Obama  with reduced
international support as he considers an attack.  IAG, the owner of British Airways, lost 1.7 percent to
287.5 pence. EasyJet, Europe’s second-largest discount carrier,
retreated 2.8 percent to 1,224 pence.  Bwin.Party plunged 13 percent to 110.5 pence, the biggest
slide since April 2011, as the online gambling company forecast
annual revenue will decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
