LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) , Germany’s second-largest residential landlord by market value, said first-half
profit rose 10.9 percent after the company increased rental
income and lowered financing costs.  Funds from operations  excluding asset sales, a measure of a
property company’s ability to generate cash, climbed to 68.4
million euros ($91 million) from 61.7 million euros a year
earlier, the company said in a  statement  today.  “We expect rents to keep rising in the second half,” the
Dusseldorf-based company said in the statement. “We even expect
a further reduction in the vacancy rate due to current demand
levels.”  LEG was taken public by former owner Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in February in the German property industry’s biggest
initial public offering. The country’s residential landlords are
benefiting from rising rents as household growth in  Germany 
outpaces new-home construction.  Net income was 34.7 million euros compared with a loss of
10.3 million euros a year earlier, the company said. Profit from
LEG’s main business of renting apartments rose to 123.7 million
euros from 117 million euros a year earlier. Net financing costs
fell to 60.9 million euros from 110.5 million euros.  Rising Tide  Rental income was boosted by rising occupancy and higher
rents. The vacancy rate fell to 3 percent from 3.9 percent a
year earlier. Average monthly rent climbed 1.9 percent to 4.92
euros a square meter, LEG said.  The company repeated that it expects full-year FFO to
increase to 137 million euros to 140 million euros from 136.5
million euros in 2012. LEG predicted a 10 percent increase in
FFO next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
