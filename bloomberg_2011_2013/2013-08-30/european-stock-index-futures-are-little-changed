European stocks  fell, extending a
weekly loss, as oil and gas companies dropped, outweighing
better-than-expected euro-area economic confidence data.  BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc each slipped at least 1
percent as crude declined after the U.K. parliament rejected a
motion for military action against Syria. Royal  KPN (KPN)  NV slid 3.4
percent after  America Movil  SAB said it may withdraw its
takeover bid if opposed by the company’s independent foundation.
Hermes International SCA climbed 2.1 percent after reporting
operating profit that surpassed analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.9 percent to 297.32 at
the close of trading, its lowest level since July 17. The gauge
fell 2.4 percent this week, its second weekly decline, for a 0.8
percent monthly loss, amid concern that the U.S. and its allies
will take military action against Syria. It has still risen 7.9
percent since a June 24 low as central banks pledged to support
the global economy and data showed the euro area emerged from a
record-long recession in the second quarter.  “In the short term, European equities have gone a bit too
far,” said  Max King , a London-based investment strategist at
Investec Asset Management, which manages about $104 billion.
“We’re worried that people are extrapolating a flattening out
of the euro-zone economy into growth and getting carried away.”  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600-listed
companies was 21 percent higher than the average of the last 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Euro Confidence  Economic confidence  in the euro area soared to a two-year
high in August. An index of executive and consumer sentiment
rose for a fourth month to 95.2 from 92.5 in July, the European
Commission in Brussels said. The median of 26 economists’
forecasts in a  Bloomberg News survey  was for a gain to 93.8.  In the U.S., the MNI Chicago Report business barometer rose
to 53 in August from a reading of 52.3 the prior month. Numbers
greater than 50 signal expansion. The median forecast of 53
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 53. The  regional index  is
viewed as an indicator of business activity across the U.S.  Separate data from the Commerce Department showed  consumer
spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of the  U.S.
economy , rose 0.1 percent after a revised 0.6 percent increase
the prior month that was larger than previously estimated. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a
0.3 percent rise.  National benchmark indexes fell in all western European
markets except  Greece . The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 1.1 percent,
France’s CAC 40 retreated 1.3 percent and Germany’s DAX
retreated 1.1 percent.  Oil Decline  BP fell 1 percent to 446.2 pence, Total SA dropped 1.4
percent to 41.92 euros and Shell lost 1.4 percent to 24.49 pence
as a gauge of oil and gas companies posted the fourth-worst
performance of the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600.  Crude fell for a second day as the U.K.’s House of Commons
rejected Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s proposal for strikes
against Syria.  KPN slid 3.4 percent to 2.21 euros, paring earlier losses
of as much as 8.4 percent. The company’s independent foundation
yesterday exercised an option to acquire preferred shares,
giving it almost 50 percent of issued and voting stock. America
Movil said today it may withdraw its offer of 2.40 euros a share
for majority control of the Dutch phone company if blocked by
the KPN foundation.  Danone SA (BN)  declined 1.6 percent to 56.34 euros after saying
baby-nutrition sales will fall in  Asia  in the third quarter. The
company said it had to recall infant-formula products after
milk-powder supplier Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. warned of a
contaminated ingredient.  Danone Sales  Danone, which gets 20 percent of revenue from baby
nutrition, recalled the products in eight markets, including  New
Zealand ,  China  and  Hong Kong , as a precautionary measure.  ThromboGenics NV (THR)  tumbled 18 percent to 22.93 euros, the
biggest drop since at least July 2006. The Belgian drugmaker
said sales of Jetrea, the eye drug approved by the U.S. last
year, will not increase in the second half of the year. That
implies full-year sales will be 36 percent less than estimates
for 39.4 million euros, according to Richard Vosser, an analyst
at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  London .  Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment Plc (BPTY)  plunged 14 percent to
110 pence, the biggest drop since April 2011, after the online
gaming company said 2013 sales will be 14 percent to 17 percent
lower than last year’s figures. Analysts on average had forecast
a sales drop of 9.2 percent.  Hermes (RMS)  added 2.1 percent to 253.70 euros. The French maker
of Kelly bags  reported  first-half operating profit rose 14
percent to 584.1 million euros ($773.6 million), exceeding the
569 million-euro average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. It also confirmed its July forecast that sales in 2013,
excluding currency swings, will increase more than 10 percent.  Telecom Italia  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  surged 9.4 percent to 53 euro cents
after Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said Italy’s biggest phone
company is a potential takeover target for telecommunications
operators including Vodafone Group Plc and AT&T Inc.  L’Oreal SA (OR)  advanced 3.2 percent to 126.25 euros, the
biggest gain in more than four months, after saying first-half
operating profit rose to 2.04 billion euros, or 17.4 percent of
sales. That’s a record percentage for a six-month period.  Separately, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Agon said in
an interview with  Les Echos  that the world’s biggest cosmetics
maker has the resources to buy back the more-than 29 percent
stake owned by Nestle SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
