Asian  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index gaining a second day, on receding prospects for
an imminent strike against  Syria . Energy shares retreated as oil
extended losses.  Hokkaido Electric Power Co. added 3.5 percent in  Tokyo  to
lead utilities higher after forecasting a narrower loss.  Inpex (1605) 
Corp., Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, dropped 2 percent. Ping An
Insurance (Group) Co., China’s second-largest insurer, gained
0.9 percent in Hong Kong after saying first-half profit climbed.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent to 130.24 as
of 10:09 p.m. in Tokyo, after swinging between gains of as much
as 0.5 percent and losses of 0.1 percent. The gauge has declined
0.9 percent this week and a 1.5 percent this month. The MSCI
Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index gained 1 percent.  “The fact that attack on Syria is less likely is obviously
a positive thing as far as sentiment goes,”  Andrew Sullivan ,
director of sales trading at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong,
said by telephone. “But we’ve also seen an impact on  oil prices 
and gold. That’s part of the choppiness.”  Japan’s  Topix index  slipped 0.9 percent even after data
showed consumer prices rose at the fastest pace since 2008.
Industrial production increased less than economists’ estimates.  South Korea’s  Kospi index  added 1 percent. New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index gained 0.5 percent, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 0.8 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index and
China’s Shanghai Composite Index both added 0.1 percent.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index increased 1.3 percent, while
Singapore’s Straits Times Index slid 0.3 percent. India’s S&P
BSE  Sensex (SENSEX)  climbed 1.2 percent.  Utilities Advance  Utilities gained the most among the 10 industry groups on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Hokkaido Electric rose 3.5 percent
to 1,154 yen after projecting a first-half loss of 1 billion yen
($10 million) versus 48.6 billion yen a year earlier. Shikoku
Electric Power Co. added 3.9 percent to 1,534 yen.  Crude oil fell a second day after U.K. lawmakers rejected a
motion by Prime Minister  David Cameron  seeking endorsement for
military strikes against Syria, easing concern that oil supplies
will be disrupted in the  Middle East .  President  Barack Obama  is struggling to marshal evidence
backing charges that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was
responsible for the use of chemical weapons near Damascus last
week, according to three U.S. intelligence officials familiar
with the situation. Syrian opposition groups say 1,300 people
died in the attack.  Inpex lost 2 percent to 445,500 yen. China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec, fell 1.8 percent to
HK$5.59. Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil and gas
explorer, dropped 0.8 percent to HK$15.40.  U.S. Growth  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  advanced 0.2
percent today. The measure gained 0.2 percent yesterday as a
report showed the  U.S. economy  grew 2.5 percent in the second
quarter, up from an initial estimate of 1.7 percent and more
than the 2.2 percent projected by economists.  “We have a nice revision to the U.S. GDP, but the outlook
remains very tough,” said Sullivan at Kim Eng Securities.
“There are so many macro overhangs at the moment and a lot of
trading investors are waiting on the sidelines.”  Among other stocks that gained, Ping An Insurance rose 0.9
percent to HK$54.35. First-half profit increased 28 percent on
higher investment and banking income.  China Cosco Holdings Co., the nation’s biggest shipping
company, added 3.8 percent to HK$3.56 in Hong Kong. Losses
narrowed after asset sales helped offset a freight-rate slump.
The loss in the six months through June was 990 million  yuan 
($162 million), compared with a 4.87 billion-yuan decline a year
earlier.  Regional Performance  The MSCI Asia Pacific has risen 0.7 percent this year,
 lagging  a 15 percent surge in the  S&P 500 . Investors have sold
assets across the region on expectations the  Federal Reserve 
will taper economic stimulus next month.  The Asia Pacific index trades at 12.7 times estimated
earnings, compared with 14.9 for the S&P 500 Index and 13.6
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
