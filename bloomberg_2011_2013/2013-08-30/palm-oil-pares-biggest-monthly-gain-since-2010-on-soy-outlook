Palm oil  fell for a second day to a
one-week low, paring the biggest monthly gain since December
2010, as improved weather in the U.S. boosted output prospects
for soybeans, which are crushed to make an alternative oil.  Palm for November delivery declined 1.2 percent to 2,410
ringgit ($734) a metric ton on the Bursa  Malaysia  Derivatives,
the lowest closing level for the most-active contract since Aug.
23. Palm for physical delivery in September was at 2,450
ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Futures rose 7.8 percent this month as a weaker ringgit
boosted exports prospects from Malaysia, the second-biggest
producer, and on speculation that dry weather in the U.S. may
cut soybean output. In the U.S., rains across central and
eastern areas of the Midwest this weekend will improve moisture
slightly for soybean and corn growth, MDA Information Systems
LLC said in a five-day forecast yesterday. Soybeans fell today.  “The soy complex, which has been the catalyst for the
positive movement, has corrected today because of better weather
and this is rubbing off on palm,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan,
a director at Commtrendz Risk Management Services Pvt., by phone
from Mumbai. “Fresh demand from current levels looks unlikely
and will resurface only once there is a correction.”  Soybeans for November delivery lost as much as 1.6 percent
to $13.46 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest
since Aug. 23, and were at $13.54.  Soybean oil  for delivery in
December declined 0.4 percent to 44.03 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery fell 0.7 percent to
close at 5,554  yuan  ($908) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange . Soybean oil declined 0.7 percent to end at 7,172 yuan
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
