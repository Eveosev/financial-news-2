The zloty strengthened the most in a
week as  Poland ’s economic growth quickened in the second quarter
amid a surge in exports.  The Polish currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 4.2610
against the euro, the biggest advance since Aug. 23, at 1:34
p.m. in Warsaw. That reduced its year-to-date loss to 4.2
percent while quarter-to-date gain widened to 1.5 percent, the
best performance among emerging-market currencies monitored by
Bloomberg. The yield on two-year government notes fell 1 basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.13 percent.  Gross domestic product rose 0.8 percent from a year
earlier, according to a statement from the Warsaw-based Central
Statistical Office today. GDP growth accelerated from 0.5
percent in the first quarter.  Today’s data confirms “the economy has bottomed out, after
reaching the trough of economic cycle at the beginning of the
year,” economists at Bank Zachodni WBK SA in Warsaw, led by
 Maciej Reluga , said in a report today.  Exports climbed 5.1 percent from a year earlier in the
three months through June, the fastest pace since 2011, the
statistics office said in its breakdown of GDP aggregates.
Private consumption rose 0.2 percent after remaining unchanged
in the first quarter, while fixed investment dropped 3.8 percent
after falling 2 percent in the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
