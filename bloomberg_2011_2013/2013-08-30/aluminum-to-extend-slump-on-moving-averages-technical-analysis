Aluminum, which has lost 12 percent
this year, may decline further about 13 percent after prices
failed to rise above a 200-day moving average, according to
technical analysis by Commerzbank AG.  The metal reached last week resistance at the April high of
$1,946 a metric ton and the 200-day moving average of $1,945.61,
 Karen Jones  and  Axel Rudolph , London-based technical analysts at
the bank, wrote in a report Aug. 28. Resistance refers to levels
where sell orders may be clustered.  Prices have since traded below those levels and may extend
losses to the 55-day moving average of $1,830.86, they said. If
prices fall below the June low of $1,758, the lowest since July
2009, the metal may then drop to $1,605, the analysts said.  “We continue to view aluminum as vulnerable on the
downside from a longer-term perspective,” they said.  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $1,833 at 2:26 p.m. in  Shanghai .  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast price direction.
Support areas are marked by clusters of buy orders. Fibonacci
analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a new high or low.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
