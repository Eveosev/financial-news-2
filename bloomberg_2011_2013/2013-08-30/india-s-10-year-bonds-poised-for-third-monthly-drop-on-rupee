India ’s 10-year government bonds
dropped for a third month, poised for the longest run of losses
in three years, as the rupee’s plunge to a record stoked concern
inflation will accelerate even as economic growth slows.  The currency has tumbled 9.7 percent this month and touched
an unprecedented 68.8450 per dollar on Aug. 28, increasing costs
for the nation that imports about 80 percent of its oil.
 Wholesale prices  rose 5.79 percent in July, compared with 4.86
percent the previous month, official data show.  The yield on the 7.16 percent notes due May 2023 jumped 67
basis points this month, or 0.67 percentage point, data complied
by Bloomberg show. The stretch of losses is the longest since
August 2010. The rate touched 9.23 percent on Aug. 19, the
highest for a benchmark 10-year note since August 2008. It rose
seven basis points today to 8.84 percent as of 10:24 a.m. in
Mumbai, prices from the central bank’s trading system show.  “Sharp weakness in the rupee is starting to weigh on
 India’s economy , as reflected in the slump in industrial
activity and the spike in July WPI inflation,”  Standard
Chartered  Plc analysts including London-based Priyanka Kishore
and Singapore-based Nagaraj Kulkarni wrote in a report
yesterday. “We expect the  Reserve Bank  of India to maintain its
tight liquidity stance until the rupee stabilizes, keeping
short-end interest rates elevated.”  Yield Forecast  Standard Chartered sees the benchmark 10-year bond yield at
8.75 percent in the third quarter of 2013 versus a previous
forecast of 8 percent, according to the report. The yield on the
2023 bonds rallied 73 basis points in July after advancing 20
basis points in June, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Growth in  Asia ’s third-largest economy slowed to 4.7
percent in the quarter ended June 30, from 4.8 percent in the
previous three months, according to the median estimate of 44
analysts in a Bloomberg survey before date due today. That would
be the least since the quarter ended March 2009.  The rupee slid 0.5 percent to 66.9250 per dollar today and
is poised for a third week of losses after a series of measures
by policy makers since mid-July failed to stem its slide. The
RBI raised two  interest rates  and tightened the supply of cash
in the banking system in July. A surge in yields after the cash
squeeze prompted the RBI to announce a plan to buy long-dated
debt.  India will sell 170 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) of bonds
maturing between 2019 and 2041 at an auction today.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points today to 9.78 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
