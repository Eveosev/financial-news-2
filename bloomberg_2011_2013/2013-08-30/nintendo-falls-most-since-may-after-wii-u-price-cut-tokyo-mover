Nintendo Co. (7974)  fell the most since May
after the company cut the price of its Wii U video-game console
by $50 as it attempts to boost sales in the months before
competing machines are released.  Nintendo fell 6.1 percent, the biggest drop since May 23,
to 11,120 yen at the close in  Tokyo  trading. The stock had
gained 31 percent this year through yesterday’s close, compared
with the 30 percent jump in the broader Topix index. Nintendo
announced the price cut at the same time it said it would
introduce the Nintendo 2DS, an entry-level portable game player
that can run the same games as its 3DS and costs just $129.99.  “The stock market didn’t think highly of the price cuts
and the introduction of the 2DS,” said Tomoaki Kawasaki, an
analyst at  Iwai Cosmo Holdings Inc. (8707)  in Tokyo.  The suggested price of the Wii U in the U.S. will drop to
$299.99 on Sept. 20, Kyoto, Japan-based Nintendo said Aug. 28 in
a statement. The company won’t lower the console’s cost in
 Japan , where it sells for a suggested 30,000 yen ($307). The 2DS
portable machine will go on sale Oct. 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
