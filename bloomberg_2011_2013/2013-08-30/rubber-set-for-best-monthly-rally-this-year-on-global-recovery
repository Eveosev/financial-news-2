Rubber headed for the biggest
monthly advance since December as economic data from  Japan  to
the U.S. showed signs of improvement, boosting demand for the
commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in February on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange gained as much as 0.8 percent to 274.1 yen a kilogram
($2,790 a metric ton) and was at 272.5 yen at 10:22 a.m. Futures
climbed 1.2 percent this week and 13 percent in August.  Japan’s consumer prices increased at the fastest pace since
2008 in July, adding to signs that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is
making progress in pulling the economy out of deflation. A
report showed yesterday U.S. economic growth beat estimates,
sending the dollar higher against the Japanese currency and
boosting the appeal of yen-based contracts.  “Data showing a recovery in the U.S. and Japanese
economies are positive for rubber demand,” said  Kazuhiko Saito ,
an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  The  U.S. economy  grew 2.5 percent in the second quarter, up
from an initial estimate of 1.7 percent and more than the 2.2
percent projected by economists. Japan’s industrial production
rose 3.2 percent in July from the previous month, according to
data from the Trade Ministry today.  Futures for January delivery were little changed at 20,140
 yuan  ($3,291) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board lost 0.4 percent to 84.65 baht ($2.63) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
