Canada’s budget deficit in the first
three months of the fiscal year narrowed on lower borrowing
costs, putting the federal government on track to meet longer-term targets.  The deficit in the April-to-June period fell to C$2.55
billion ($2.42 billion) from C$2.81 billion a year earlier, the
finance department said in an e-mailed statement. Public debt
charges fell 2 percent to C$7.67 billion.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty ’s annual budget, released in
March, projected a deficit for the current fiscal year of C$18.7
billion, from C$25.9 billion in the previous year.  The financial results for the quarter “and recent economic
developments suggest that the fiscal projection presented in
Economic Action Plan 2013 is on track,” the finance department
said in the statement.  The federal government’s budget swung into a C$158 million
surplus in June, after a C$993 million deficit a year earlier.
The finance department cited revenue “timing” issues for the
change.  Total program expenses rose 4.5 percent in the three-month
period, while revenues were up 4.3 percent. The fiscal plan
projected a 0.8 percent increase in expenses for the full year
and a 3.8 percent rise in receipts. Public debt charges are
projected to increase 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
