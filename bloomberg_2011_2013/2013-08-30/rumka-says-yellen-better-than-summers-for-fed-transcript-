AFL-CIO President  Richard Trumka 
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political
Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that Federal
Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen has a better approach on
employment policies than  Lawrence Summers  and is a better
candidate to be the next head of the central bank.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Welcome back. Richard Trumka joins me now. Thank
you for being with me, Mr. Trumka.  RICHARD TRUMKA: Thanks for having me on.  HUNT: It’s Labor Day weekend. The state of organized labor
on the appearances don’t look so good. You only have 11 percent
of the workforce unionized, about half what it was 30 years ago,
not making much progress in  Washington , getting clobbered in
state legislatures. Is that too bleak a picture?  TRUMKA: Yeah, I think it is. In fact, I feel the opposite.
This is - this is one of the Labor Days where I have my most
optimism, because, you know, we are being attacked in the
states. We are being attacked at the federal level. But workers
are coming together like they never have before, and we opened
up the process to all of our progressive allies.  We started this six months ago going into our convention,
broadening our progressive allies, where we’re thinking
together, strategizing together, planning together, and
hopefully executing together. And I have real faith that we’ll
be able to create an economy that has shared prosperity for
everyone.  HUNT: Huge budget battles in October over the debt and
deficits. How confident are you that President Obama is going to
hang tough and not compromise with some of the Republican
demands?  TRUMKA: Well, you know, that’s another contrived or created
crisis. There is no crisis here, and I don’t think the
Republicans are going to shut down the government.  HUNT: You don’t?  TRUMKA: No, I do not. They can’t afford to. Their - some of
their best political people, their best donors are going to get
hurt in the process. It hurts the economy. And I don’t think
they’re going to do it. It’s -  HUNT: And the same with the debt ceiling, they’re not going
to play games with that?  TRUMKA: I think they - I’m not saying they won’t play
games.  I’m just saying they’re not going to shut down the
government over either one of those. They’ll talk through
things, and Boehner’s already offered a short-term extension,
and we’ll see what happens.  HUNT: Can you replace the sequester?  TRUMKA: Sequester needs to be replaced.  HUNT: It does. Do you think it’ll happen, though?  TRUMKA: I don’t know. I hope so, because it’s having a real
-  HUNT: You seem a little doubtful.  TRUMKA: It’s - well, I’m not certain about anything, given
this Congress, particularly the Republican side of this
Congress. So it’s - I mean not certain of it, but it needs to
end, because it’s being a drag on the economy. It’s costing us a
lot of jobs; 960,000 jobs next year will be lost because of
sequestration. We can’t afford that. There aren’t enough jobs,
let alone losing another million.  HUNT: You are a major Obama supporter. He’s been good to
you. Four-and-a-half years into this administration, corporate
profits are booming, Wall Street is making billions, but wages
are stagnant. How much of that responsibility is the
president’s?  TRUMKA: I think it’s all of our responsibility. It’s not
just the president. It’s all of our responsibility, from the
 Federal Reserve  to Congress not doing what they should do -  HUNT: What more can Obama do to facilitate that?  TRUMKA: I think he can push more on infrastructure. We have
an infrastructure that’s falling around us. We’re being less
competitive as a nation. I think both parties understand that
the infrastructure of the country is essential for our
competitiveness in the global economy. They ought to be doing
more. That creates jobs. That makes us more competitive. It
makes our products more competitive. There’s no reason not to do
it, so we need to push that and get pushing on a big scale.  HUNT: Let’s turn to immigration. You are a critical
supporter of the immigration bill that passed the Senate. You
fashioned the compromise with business over guest workers
permitted in this country. Some  House Republicans  are trying to
expand the number of guest workers that was in that Senate bill.
In order to get a bill through, is that a negotiable issue?  TRUMKA: Look, there are people on the Republican side that
don’t want any bill, so they will try whatever ploy they can to
prevent this. There’s only two things stopping this bill from
becoming a reality: that’s  John Boehner  and the House
Republicans.  They need to get with it.  And if they don’t get with it, they will pay such a price
at the polls for the next decade or two that they will regret
the day that they didn’t try to provide a pathway for
citizenship, they didn’t try to create a broken system that
keeps 11 million people in the shadows, 11 million people who
are citizens in every way but on paper.  HUNT: And the final - if there is a final bill, the guest
worker provision that was in the Senate will be the final
provision, you would think?  TRUMKA: That’s a good bill. And both - both business and
labor and a number of others are supportive of that.  HUNT: It shouldn’t be changed?  TRUMKA: It should not be changed.  HUNT: You have said earlier that your preference for the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, which you mentioned as being
critical to the economy, would be  Janet Yellen , the current vice
chair. Let me ask you this.  Larry Summers , who is the leading
candidate, according to some reports at least, has said that he
thinks that unemployment is every bit as important as fighting
inflation. As a matter of fact, he said the last couple years we
ought to focus more on jobs and less on the deficit.  What is it about Mr. Summers that you find less desirable
than Janet Yellen?  TRUMKA: You know, I never said one was less desirable than
the other. I never said that.  HUNT: I’m sorry. I thought you said you preferred Yellen.  TRUMKA: Well, what I said is, if you look at history and
their records, she seems to have the edge, she seems to be a
better candidate from our point of view, and here’s why. One,
when things were going wrong in the economy, in each one of
those instances, she predicted them accurately. Larry didn’t.
Larry we thought at that time was too close to  Wall Street , and
it allowed him to jade his thought process.  The second thing is, Janet Yellen has been for a balanced
approach to the Federal Reserve. That means that - they have two
mandates, fight inflation and create full employment. Larry and
everyone before, all the way back to  Paul Volcker , have said
we’re not going to worry about full employment, we’re only going
to worry -  HUNT: But Larry does say he worries about full employment.  TRUMKA: Recently. And I hope that that continues on. And if
he becomes the - the chair of the Fed, I hope he continues on
and - and aggressively enforces that part of his mandate, as he
does the inflation mandate.  HUNT: So, therefore, if Obama were to nominate Summers
rather than your preference, which would be Yellen, you wouldn’t
oppose the Summers nomination?  TRUMKA: I don’t know. It would all depend on what happens,
you know, what’s said and what he’s going to do.  HUNT: All right. A very happy Labor Day to you, Rich
Trumka.  Thank you so much for being with us.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
