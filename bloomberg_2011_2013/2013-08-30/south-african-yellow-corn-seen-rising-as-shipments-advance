South African yellow corn futures
gained today on signs of increased demand from other countries.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, increased 1.1 percent to 2,219 rand a metric ton by
the noon close on the South African Futures Exchange. The white
variety for delivery in the same month gained 0.6 percent to
2,365 rand ($231) a ton.  “The yellow exports over the last three months might have
had something to do with it,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said in an e-mailed response today.  The country exported 84,449 tons of yellow corn in the week
to Aug. 16, including 50,170 tons to  Japan  and 30,166 tons to
 South Korea , the Pretoria-Based South African Grain Information
Service said in a statement on its website on Aug. 20. That’s
the largest shipment of the variety since the week through July
26, when  South Africa  exported 94,411 tons, the most in at least
a decade, according to the organization. The nation shipped
36,497 tons of the grain in the week to Aug. 23, including
36,024 tons to South Korea and 473 tons to  China .  South Africa may run out of yellow corn if exports rise
further, potentially lifting prices for the white variety, Grain
SA, an organization representing growers and traders, said July
2.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from white corn is used as one of the nation’s staple
foods, while the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to 3,427
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
