Copper was poised for the biggest
monthly advance since September as economic reports from  Japan 
to the U.S. signaled the global recovery is strengthening and
prospects of an imminent strike against  Syria  eased.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange climbed as much as 0.7 percent to $7,200.75 a metric
ton and traded at $7,189.50 at 10:59 a.m. in Tokyo. Prices,
which advanced for the first time in four days, have risen 4.5
percent this month, gaining for the second straight month.  Japan’s consumer prices rose in July at the fastest pace
since 2008, jobless rate fell and industrial production
increased. The U.S. economy grew more than forecast last quarter.
Concern conflict with Syria will disrupt Middle East oil
supplies eased as U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron failed to
gain parliamentary backing for military action.  “With the positive economic data from Japan and the U.S.,
copper appeared more attractive after recent price drops,” said
 Tetsu Emori , the chief fund manager at Astmax Asset Management
Inc. in Tokyo. “Sentiment also improved after the U.K
parliament voted against military strikes on Syria.”  Consumer-price growth in Japan accelerated to 0.7 percent
from a year earlier in July, up from 0.2 percent in June and
matching the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The
unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent from 3.9 percent. Factory
production expanded 1.6 percent from a year earlier, below the
1.8 percent estimated by economists.  Futures for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.9 percent to 51,880  yuan  ($8,476) a ton. Metal
for delivery in December was 0.3 percent higher at $3.2695 a
pound on the Comex in New York.  On the LME, aluminum, tin and lead were little changed,
while zinc and nickel declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
