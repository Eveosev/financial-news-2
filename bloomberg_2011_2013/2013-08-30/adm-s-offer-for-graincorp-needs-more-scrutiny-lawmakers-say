Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) ’s planned
A$2.2 billion ($2 billion) takeover of  GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC)  should be
re-examined by Australia’s competition regulator, a committee of
federal lawmakers said.  A separate appraisal of the deal being made by the Foreign
Investment Review Board should examine a possible loss of tax
revenue and distortion of the country’s agriculture market, the
Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport committee said
today in an interim  report .  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission “didn’t
have the expertise or the resources to ask the questions which
we have asked,” and should reexamine the planned takeover,
committee chairman Senator Bill Heffernan said today in a phone
interview. The commission said June 27 it didn’t plan to oppose
the deal.  Decatur, Illinois-based ADM has agreed to acquire GrainCorp
for A$12.20 a share, subject to approval from the board and
China’s Ministry of Commerce. The approvals are necessary as the
deal gives ADM, the world’s biggest corn processor, control over
seven of the eight ports that ship grain in bulk from
 Australia ’s east coast.  The Senate committee will seek to continue its inquiry when
Parliament resumes after Australia’s Sept. 7 election and plans
to seek evidence in public hearings from Cargill Inc., Glencore
Xstrata Plc and Toepfer International, Heffernan said by phone.
Lawmakers will ask ADM and GrainCorp to supply additional
evidence, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
