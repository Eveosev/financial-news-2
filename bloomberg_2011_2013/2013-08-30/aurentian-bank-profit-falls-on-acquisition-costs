Laurentian Bank of Canada , the
country’s seventh-biggest lender, missed analysts’ estimates
after posting a 5.7 percent decline in third-quarter net income
on costs tied to acquisitions.  Profit for the period ended July 31 was C$28.3 million
($26.9 million), or 91 cents a share, down from C$30 million, or
C$1.06 a year earlier, the Montreal-based company said today in
a statement.  Laurentian said it earned C$1.31 a share excluding some
items, missing the C$1.33 share average  estimate  of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Laurentian, the last of  Canada ’s largest
banks to report, was the only one among the group to miss
estimates.  Laurentian said it recorded about C$14.6 million of
“transaction and integration related costs” tied to its
November 2011 acquisition of two units from Mackenzie Financial
Corp. and last year’s purchase of a trust unit of  AGF Management
Ltd. (AGF/B)   To contact the reporter on this story:
