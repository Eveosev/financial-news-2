Sloane Stephens made quick work of
Jamie Hampton in a battle of American women at the U.S. Open,
where men’s defending champion Andy Murray ousted Leonardo Mayer
to advance to the third round.  Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, the 2009 champion and
the No. 6 seed this year, lost in five sets to 2001 champion
Lleyton Hewitt, 32, of  Australia , who is unseeded this year.
Hewitt won 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-1.  Stephens, seeded 15th for the tennis season’s final Grand
Slam tournament, needed just 63 minutes to beat 23rd-seeded
Hampton 6-1, 6-3 in a third-round match in Arthur Ashe Stadium
at the National Tennis Center in New York.  “It’s obviously tough playing Jamie, a good friend,”
Stephens, a Fed Cup teammate of Hampton, said in a televised on-court interview after her win. “Definitely a tough match to
come out here on Ashe in front of all you guys, but I tried to
stay focused and do my best.”  Stephens could face top seed and defending champion Serena Williams for a spot in the quarterfinals. Williams, the four-time U.S. Open champion who’s also from the U.S., is due to play
her second match in as many days, taking on Yaroslava Shvedova
of Kazakhstan tonight.  Last month’s Wimbledon champion, Murray’s serve was broken
once in his 7-5, 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 win against Mayer of Argentina.
His 28 winners were 11 fewer than Mayer’s, but he had 26
unforced errors -- about half of Mayer’s 49.  ‘Very Tough’  “That was a very tough match, both of us ran a lot,”
Murray said in a televised interview. “He’s a big hitter, I had
to defend a lot.”  Top-seeded Novak Djokovic, playing an earlier match on the
Ashe court, saved two set points with Benjamin Becker serving at
5-4 in the first set. He went on to defeat the 32-year-old from
Germany who is ranked 87th on the ATP World Tour, 7-6 (7-2) 6-2,
6-2.  “It was a lot of unforced errors, very windy conditions,”
Djokovic, 26, the 2011 U.S. Open champion from  Serbia , told
reporters after making 26 unforced errors in the match. “You
couldn’t really read and kind of predict where the ball is going
to go, so you have to be very alert. At the start I had
difficulty with my footwork.”  Sousa Next  Djokovic will play Joao Sousa of Portugal in the third
round. Sousa, ranked 95th on the ATP World Tour, beat Jarko
Nieminen of Finland 1-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.  With the women’s field in the third round today and the
men’s draw completing the second, women’s No. 4 Sara Errani is
the only player seeded in the top 10 of either side to have
exited, falling to fellow Italian Flavia Pennetta yesterday.  Fifth-seeded Li Na of  China  today beat No. 32 seed Laura Robson of Britain 6-2, 7-5. Li, 31, had six aces in the match
against the 19-year-old Robson, including one on a second serve
to close out the 81-minute meeting.  Agnieszka Radwanska, the No. 3 seed from  Poland , followed
Li into the fourth round with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-1) win against 32nd-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of  Russia . Radwanksa limited her
unforced errors to 15, compared to 41 by Pavlyuchenkova.  Jankovic Wins  Radwanska next will face the No. 24 seed, Russia’s
 Ekaterina Makarova , who knocked off 16th-seeded Sabine Lisicki
of Germany 6-4, 7-5. Lisicki was the runner-up at Wimbledon this
year, falling to Marion Bartoli.  Jelena Jankovic, the No. 9 seed from Serbia, beat Japanese
qualifier Kurumi Nara 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).  Rajeev Ram, a 29-year-old American, blew a two-set lead
against Marcel Granollers of Spain, falling 3-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3,
7-5. American Denis Kudla played a close match against Tomas Berdych, the No. 5 seed from the Czech Republic, falling 7-6
(7-3), 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.  Tim Smyczek, a wild-card entry from the U.S., beat Russian
Alex Bogomolov Jr. 3-6, 7-6 (8-6), 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. He’ll face
Granollers in the third round, while 24-year-old American Donald
Young lost to Florian Mayer of  Germany  7-5, 6-3, 6-4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
