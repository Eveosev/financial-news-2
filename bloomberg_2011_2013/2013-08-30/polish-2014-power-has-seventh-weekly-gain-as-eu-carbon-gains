Polish electricity for delivery next
year increased as EU carbon permits advanced and the local
economy accelerated its rate of expansion.  The contract gained 0.6 percent to 150.80 zloty ($46.88) a
megawatt-hour, rising for a seventh week, according to broker
data on Bloomberg. European Union carbon emission permits
advanced 2.7 percent this week on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  “Increasing carbon prices are an obvious price driver on
top of good macroeconomic data and high spot power prices,”
Tomasz Krzyzewski, director of power trading at the Polish unit
of Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., said by phone today.  Polish economic growth accelerated to 0.8 percent in the
second quarter from 0.5 percent in the previous three months,
according to data published today by Central Statistical Office
in Warsaw.  European  coal  for delivery in September increased 0.1
percent to $76.25 a metric ton at 11:45 a.m. in London
