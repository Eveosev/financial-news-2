Mexico’s peso headed for its worst
weekly selloff since June as concern mounted that the U.S.
Federal Reserve will reduce monetary stimulus next month.  The peso fell 2.8 percent to 13.3367 per  U.S. dollar  this
week as of 10:13 a.m. in Mexico City, the steepest decline of 16
major dollar counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s peso has retreated amid concern the U.S. central
bank will reduce its $85 billion monthly bond purchase program,
which had boosted capital flows to the Latin American country.
Fed officials next meet Sept. 17-18.  Investors should take “a lot of caution” with the peso,
Juan Carlos Alderete, a strategist with Grupo Financiero Banorte
SAB, said today in a research note.  Alderete said investors sometimes sell the peso as a
“hedge” for positions in other emerging-market assets. The
peso is among the world’s most widely-traded emerging-market
currencies, with an around-the-clock trading day.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 have climbed 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point this year, to 6.32 percent
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell
1.28 centavo to 129.63 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
