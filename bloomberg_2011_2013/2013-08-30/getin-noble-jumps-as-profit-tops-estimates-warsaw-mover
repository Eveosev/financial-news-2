Getin Noble Bank SA, the Polish
lender controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, jumped the
most in three weeks after quarterly profit beat estimates.  The  shares  climbed as much as 3.7 percent, the most since
Aug. 1, and traded up 1.9 percent at 2.18 zloty as of 10:18 a.m.
in Warsaw. More than 890,000 securities changed hands, 91
percent of the three-month daily average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Second-quarter net income rose 27 percent to 102.9 million
zloty ($31.9 million), the bank said today, beating the 80.6
million-zloty mean  estimate  of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Bad loan provisions dropped 42 percent to 143.1
million zloty.  The bank is “on its way to meet and exceed the consensus
expectations” of 278 million zloty for the full year, Michal
Konarski, an analyst at Wood & Co., said in a note today. “The
results announcement should have a slightly positive trading
impact.”  Getin Noble sees profit above 100 million zloty in future
quarters as economic growth improves, Chief Executive Officer
Krzysztof Rosinski told reporters today. Gross domestic product
rose 0.8 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
according to data published by the  Central Statistical Office  in
Warsaw, quickening from 0.5 growth in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
