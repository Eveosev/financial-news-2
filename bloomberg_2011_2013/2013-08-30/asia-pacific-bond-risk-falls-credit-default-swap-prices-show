The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  declined 2 basis points to 160.5 basis
points as of 8:22 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is poised to climb 14
basis points this month, the most since June, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 2 basis points
to 124 as of 10:34 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. The index is on course for its lowest close
since Aug. 26 and a rise of 1 basis point this month, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index slid 1.5 basis points to 95
basis points as of 9:18 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index is on track to fall 5.2 basis points in August
after a 9.6 basis-point decline in July, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
