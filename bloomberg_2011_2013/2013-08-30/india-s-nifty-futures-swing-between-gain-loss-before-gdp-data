Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures swung
between gains and losses after the biggest rise in the rupee in
27 years and falling oil prompted a rally in benchmark indexes.
The government releases quarterly economic growth data today.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for September delivery fell
less than 0.1 percent to 5,370 at 10:16 a.m. in  Singapore  after
addind as much as 0.8 percent. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index
gained 2.4 percent to 5,409.05 yesterday, the biggest gain since
June 28. The S&P BSE Sensex added 2.3 percent, sending its  30-day volatility  measure to a 20-month high. The Bank of  New York 
Mellon  India  ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares increased 0.2
percent. One-month rupee forwards fell 0.2 percent to 67.93
after the rupee surged 3.4 percent to 66.595 yesterday.  Brent
crude , the benchmark for India, dropped 1.1 percent to $113.92 a
barrel today.  The Sensex jumped yesterday after a central bank move to
sell dollars to state oil importers spurred the rally in the
rupee. The gauge has fallen 4.9 percent in August, poised for
the biggest monthly loss since February. Stocks have dropped on
concerns government efforts to stem a record plunge in the
currency may further weaken an economy that grew at a decade-low
pace in the year ended March and stoke an unprecedented current-account deficit. Data today may show gross domestic product grew
at the slowest quarterly pace in more than four years.  “One silver lining is that the economy’s increasingly
sluggish performance will bring some relief in the form of a
smaller current-account deficit,”  Richard Iley , an economist at
BNP Paribas SA, wrote in a note e-mailed yesterday. “As the
full extent of India’s growth slowdown is factored in, there is
a rising risk that equity outflows re-intensify, continuing to
push down the rupee whatever the authorities do.”  Slowing GDP  Indian economic growth slowed to 4.6 percent in the quarter
ended June 30, from 4.8 percent in the previous three months,
according to the median estimate of 43 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. That would be the slowest pace of expansion since the
quarter ended March 2009.  International investors  have sold a net $788 million of
Indian shares in August, extending outflows of $986 million in
July and $1.76 billion in June, according to data from the
market regulator. Foreigners have bought a net $11.6 billion of
the nation’s stocks this year, the second-highest among 10 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg.  The rupee has depreciated 17 percent in 2013, erasing
dollar-based investments by 22 percent from Sensex shares, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The Sensex’s valuation has dropped
to 13 times projected 12-month profit, compared with the average
of 14 times over the past five years.  The economic slowdown and a weak currency is hurting
company earnings. Combined profits for the 30 companies in the
Sensex increased 1.4 percent in the three months ended June
compared with an estimate of 5.8 percent before the reporting
season began, Bank of America Corp. analysts Jyotivardhan Jaipuria and Anand Kumar wrote in a report dated Aug. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
