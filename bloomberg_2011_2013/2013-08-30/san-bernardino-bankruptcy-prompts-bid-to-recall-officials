Voters in bankrupt San Bernardino,
 California , will have a chance to recall three elected officials
in November while three more face re-election, putting the
majority of the City Council at risk.  Council members John Valdivia and Wendy McCammack, and City
Attorney James Penman, are blamed for the “dismal shape” of
the city in petitions filed by San Bernardino Residents for
Responsible Government.  San Bernardino, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of  Los
Angeles , filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in August 2012, after a
$46 million shortfall when sales and property taxes failed to
recover from the recession. The city of 209,000 is the third-largest U.S. municipality to seek court protection from
creditors, after Detroit and Stockton, California.  “The residents of San Bernardino need and deserve stronger
and more courageous leadership to restore our city,” Scott
Beard, the recall committee leader, said by e-mail.  Three other council members are up for re-election Nov. 5,
 according  to the city clerk’s office. If the recall is
successful and all of the incumbents on the ballot lose, five of
the seven council seats would turn over.  The survivors would be Chas Kelley and Rikke Van Johnson,
against whom the recall effort fell short. Both Kelley and Van
Johnson are seeking to replace Mayor Patrick Morris, who isn’t
running. If either wins, a sixth seat would be vacated.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Meredith Jury ruled Aug. 28 that San
Bernardino was entitled to  bankruptcy protection , overruling
objections by the  California Public Employees’ Retirement
System , which is trying to recover missed pension payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
