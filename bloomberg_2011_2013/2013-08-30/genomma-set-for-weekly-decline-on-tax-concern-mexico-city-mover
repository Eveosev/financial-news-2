Genomma Lab Internacional SAB (LABB) , a
Mexican producer of over-the-counter drugs, headed to its
biggest weekly drop since June on speculation the government may
create new taxes for medicine under a fiscal overhaul.  Genomma Lab sank 0.5 percent to 28.67 pesos at 1:28 p.m. in
Mexico City trading today, bringing the selloff to 4.4 percent
this week, the most since the period ended June 21. The
benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican stocks rose 1.2 percent today,
trimming its slump this week to 3.2 percent.  President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary
Party lifted its ban on members’ voting for taxes on food and
medicine in March. While the government hasn’t yet announced
details of the tax overhaul that Pena Nieto has pledged to pass
this year, Finance Minister Luis Videgaray told reporters on
Aug. 28 that the plan will be presented with the
administration’s budget proposal by Sept. 8 at the latest.  “The market is finally pricing in the risks from the
fiscal reform,” Aldo Miranda, a trader at Intercam Casa de
Bolsa SA in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview.  Genomma Lab will be among the Mexican stocks most affected
by the reform, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
