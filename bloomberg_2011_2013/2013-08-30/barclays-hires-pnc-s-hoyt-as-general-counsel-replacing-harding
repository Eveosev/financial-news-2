Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, said it hired Bob Hoyt as group general
counsel from  PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC)   Hoyt will start in mid-October, replacing Mark Harding,
London-based Barclays said today in a statement. Before joining
the second-largest U.S. regional bank as general counsel in
2009, the 48-year-old worked at the U.S. Treasury.  Harding quit in February with Finance Director Chris Lucas,
who is under investigation by regulators about whether the bank
adequately disclosed fees it agreed to pay to the Qatar
Investment Authority when it sought to raise money from
investors including the sovereign-wealth fund. Lucas was
replaced by Tushar Morzaria last month.  “Banking is a highly regulated industry, the legal matters
we face are myriad and complex, and it was important that we
recruited a strong leader to succeed Mark,” Barclays Chief
Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  said in the statement.  The CEO said that Hoyt completes his executive team. As
well as Hoyt and Morzaria, he hired Shaygan Kheradpir as chief
operations and technology officer, responsible for helping the
lender automate more systems to cut costs, and former Financial
Services Authority CEO Hector Sants as head of compliance and
government and regulatory relations.  -- Editors: Simone Meier, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
