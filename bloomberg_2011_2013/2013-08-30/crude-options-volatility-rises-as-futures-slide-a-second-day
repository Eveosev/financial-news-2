Crude options volatility rose as
underlying futures fell a second day after British lawmakers
refused to join the U.S. in a military strike against  Syria  and
an attack by the U.S. didn’t appear imminent.  Implied volatility for at-the-money October options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
26.14 percent at 3:28 p.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange,
up from 25.67 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery fell
$1.15 to $107.65 a barrel on the Nymex, after reaching a two-year high of $110.10 two days ago. Crude advanced 2.5 percent
this month.  U.S. lost Britain’s support yesterday in acting against
Syria and its suspected use of chemical weapons, lessening
concern of an imminent strike that might embroil the  Middle East 
and disrupt oil supplies. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said
today that a U.S. intelligence assessment gives him “high
confidence” that the Syrian regime employed chemical weapons
against its own people.  Without a response from the U.S., Kerry
said, “there will be no end to the test of our resolve.”  WTI may increase next week on the prospect of an attack
against Syria, according to a slim margin in a Bloomberg survey
of 37 analysts and traders. Sixteen, or 43 percent, forecast
futures will gain through Sept. 6, while 15 respondents
predicted a drop and six said there will be no change.  Most-Active  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $120 calls, which fell 7 cents to 22 cents a barrel with
3,199 lots trading as of 3:32 p.m. October $100 puts were the
second-most active, advancing 13 cents to 37 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,411 contracts.  Calls accounted for 60 percent of electronic trading volume
today, and made up four of the five most-active contracts. In
the previous session, bullish bets made up 53 percent of the
140,430 lots traded.  March $90 puts were also the most-active options yesterday
with 5,836 contracts changing hands as they gained 16 cents to
$2.44 a barrel. October $120 calls, the next-most active, fell
32 cents to 29 cents on 5,774 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
40,948 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 37,023 lots
and December $105 calls with 34,815.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
