Thessaloniki Water Supply & Sewage
Co. (EYAPS) , the water utility in Greece’s second-largest city, said
first-half net profit fell amid lower water consumption and a
fall in corresponding sewage charges.  Profit in the six months to June 30 declined to 9 million
euros ($11.9 million) from 11.3 million euros in the same period
of 2012. Sales dropped to 36.2 million euros from 37.8 million
euros, the company said today in a statement on its  website .  The sales drop was also due to lower use of water in the
 construction industry  given Greece’s ongoing economic recession,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
