Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed with stockpiles of the additive at the lowest level in
seven weeks and as the motor fuel slumped on reduced prospects
for a strike on  Syria .  The spread, or price difference, shrank 2.64 cents to 57.5
cents a gallon. Ethanol  inventories  dropped last week to 16.3
million barrels, a record low for this time of year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices for the biofuel are on pace
for the biggest monthly gain since January.  “Stockpiles are definitely low,” said  David Dunn , an
analyst and broker at Progressive Fuels Ltd. in Naples,  Florida .
“That’s what you saw in the big rebound.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 1.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.45 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 12 percent this year.  Dunn said traders are focused on the more actively-traded
October ethanol contract, which is trading at a discount of more
than 45 cents to September.  “You had ethanol plants offline that should come back
online,” Dunn said. “People are expecting a bounce-back in
production.”  Gasoline for September delivery tumbled 4.14 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.025 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  U.K. Stand  The motor fuel rose after the U.K. House of Commons
rejected Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s plan for a military
response against Syria and its suspected use of chemical weapons
against civilians.  Corn for September delivery declined 2 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $4.9525 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively
traded December contract sank 3.25 cents to $4.7825.  The corn crush spread, or the price difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was 65 cents,
down from 65.68 cents yesterday.  A 2007 energy law requires refiners to use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol this year and 14.4 billion in 2014.
Compliance is tracked by Renewable Identification Numbers,
 certificates  attached to each gallon of ethanol that are
submitted to the government each year and that also can be
traded among companies.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  added 1 cent to 68 cents, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, rose 1 cent to 73 cents.  Ethanol  production  fell 2.8 percent to 820,000 barrels a
day last week, the least since March 29, data from Energy
Information Administration show.  Stockpiles slid 1.4 percent to 16.3 million barrels, the
lowest level since July 5, and  imports  plunged 79 percent to
4,000 barrels a day, the Energy Department’s research arm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
