Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and Virgin
Atlantic Airways Ltd., the carrier majority owned by U.K.
billionaire Richard Branson, won tentative U.S. approval of
antitrust immunity to let them coordinate fares and schedules.  Final authorization would allow the airlines to combine
their networks and complete a commercial relationship driven by
Delta’s recent purchase of a 49 percent stake in Virgin, the
U.S. Department of Transportation said today in a filing.
Anthony Black, a spokesman for Delta, confirmed the filing.  The carriers have a code-share agreement enabling bookings
to be made on each other’s jets on one itinerary, and antitrust
immunity would deepen the ties with steps such as sharing costs
as though they were a single entity. U.S. and European laws ban
foreign majority ownership of airlines.  Delta, based in Atlanta, bought the stake in Virgin from
Singapore Airlines Ltd. for $360 million this year to add trans-Atlantic flights, the world’s richest market for premium
passengers. The move is a challenge to  British Airways (IAG)  and  AMR
Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American Airlines, which now control more than half of
that service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
