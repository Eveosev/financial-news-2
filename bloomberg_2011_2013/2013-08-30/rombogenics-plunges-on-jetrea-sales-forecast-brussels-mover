ThromboGenics NV (THR) , the Belgian eye-drug developer, fell as much as 30 percent after forecasting
that sales of its only approved product won’t increase in the
second half of the year, missing analysts’ estimates.  ThromboGenics dropped to as low as 19.71 euros, the
steepest intraday decline since it sold shares to the public in
2006. The number of shares that exchanged hands was more than
five times the three-month daily average.  Second-half sales of Jetrea, the drug approved in the U.S.
last year to treat vitreomacular adhesion, will be at the same
level as first-half sales of 12.5 million euros ($17 million),
Heverlee-based ThromboGenics said after the close of trading
yesterday. That implies full-year sales will be 36 percent less
than the analyst consensus of 39.4 million euros, according to
Richard Vosser, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  London .  The hurdles to introducing Jetrea in the U.S. were “higher
than we had expected,” Vosser wrote in a note. He cut his
December 2014 price target for the stock to 24 euros from 34
euros.  The shares traded 20 percent lower at 22.53 euros as of
10:11 a.m. in Brussels. The stock has dropped 47 percent this
year,  compared  with a 13 percent gain in  Belgium ’s benchmark
Bel20 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
