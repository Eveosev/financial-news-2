Bank of England Governor Mark Carney
said policy makers could add to stimulus if needed, the Daily
Mail reported, citing an interview.  “There could be more if necessary,” Carney said when
asked if the central bank will increase its quantitative-easing
program, according to the London-based newspaper. “There won’t
be less. We’re absolutely clear about that. There has to be an
exceptional degree of stimulus.”  Carney joined the BOE in July and introduced forward
guidance this month, saying that policy makers plan to keep the
 benchmark interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent for at least
three years. The BOE maintained its QE program at 375 billion
pounds ($581 billion) on Aug. 1.  “We’re going to provide the stimulus to grow until the
economy has reached this level of a sort of self-sustaining
growth,” Carney told the Daily Mail.  The BOE’s forward guidance links policy to the jobless rate,
currently at 7.8 percent. The central bank has said it won’t
consider raising its benchmark rate until  unemployment  falls to
7 percent, something it doesn’t see happening until the end of
2016.  Carney said such policies are providing “greater
certainty” to businesses, the Daily Mail reported.  “We should start to see incomes respond and what’s
incredibly important is that people have real growth in
incomes,” he said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
