China ’s one-year interest-rate swap
completed a fourth monthly increase after the central bank
scaled back its fund injections.  The People’s Bank of China  pumped  a net 41.5 billion  yuan 
($6.7 billion) into markets this week, down from 72 billion yuan
in the previous period, Bloomberg data show. It added 29 billion
yuan through seven-day reverse-repurchase contracts at 3.9
percent on Aug. 27 and 26 billion yuan in 14-day reverse repos
at 4.1 percent yesterday. The PBOC may cut banks’ reserve
requirements this year, according to a Bank of Communications
report in the Shanghai Securities News.  “The amount of reverse-repo operations in recent weeks has
been limited,” said Guo Caomin, an analyst at Industrial Bank
Co. in Shanghai. “Concerns over a reserve requirement cut
linger, given falling yuan forex positions.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, this month to 4.14 percent as
of 4:37 p.m. in  Shanghai , data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
rate fell four basis points today.  The  seven-day repo rate , a gauge of cash availability,
slipped 125 basis points this month to 3.74 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It declined 62 basis points today.  Yuan positions  at Chinese financial institutions
accumulated from foreign-exchange purchases was 27.36 trillion
yuan at the end of July, a drop of 24.5 billion yuan from the
month before, according to central bank data. This was the
second consecutive monthly decline.  The yield on the government’s 3.38 percent bonds due May
2023 rose two basis points today and 33 basis points this month
to 4.04 percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  The China Financial Futures Exchange will start trading
government bond futures on Sept. 6, the  Securities Times 
reported today, citing an unidentified spokesperson from the
China Securities Regulatory Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
