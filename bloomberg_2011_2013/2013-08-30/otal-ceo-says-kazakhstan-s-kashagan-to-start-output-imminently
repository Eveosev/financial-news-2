Total SA (FP)  expects Kashagan, a Caspian
Sea oilfield in Kazakhstan waters, will start output imminently,
according to Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie.  “We are very close,” de Margerie said in an interview
today at an employers’ group meeting. “We had hoped it would
happen already but we had a few little last-minute problems.”  Kashagan, slated to produce as much as 370,000 barrels of
oil a day, was due to start output by June, about eight years
later than first planned and with costs nearing $46 billion,
almost double early estimates. Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch
Shell Plc, Eni SpA, Inpex Corp. and KazMunaiGaz also own stakes.
Total is counting on the field to help meet production targets.  The high-pressure reservoir with lethal levels of hydrogen
sulfide 70 kilometers (44 miles) from shore, is one of the
world’s biggest finds of the past four decades. Total is also
counting on fields in  Angola ,  China  and Gabon to boost output
this year, Yves-Louis Darricarrere, head of exploration and
production at the company, said in April.  “We are optimistic now” about the startup of Kashagan, de
Margerie said outside Paris. “It’s happening imminently.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
