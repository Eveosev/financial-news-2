Gasoline fell as crude declined
after British lawmakers refused to join the U.S. in a military
strike against  Syria  and as the end of the U.S. summer driving
season approaches.  Futures sank as much as 1.2 percent as the U.S. lost the
support of Britain yesterday in acting against Syria and its
suspected use of chemical weapons, lessening concern of an
imminent strike that might embroil the  Middle East  and disrupt
oil supplies. U.S. gasoline  demand  dipped to a five-week low in
the seven days ended Aug. 23 and in June was the lowest for that
month since 2001,  government data  show.  ’’The market is waiting to see if the U.S. is willing to go
it alone on Syria or will cobble together some amount of
international support,’’ said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “Gasoline has been under pressure
since the EIA issued its June data yesterday.”  Gasoline for September delivery fell 3.2 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.0344 a gallon at 10:09 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 7.2 percent below the
100-day average. Prices have declined 0.3 percent in August.  The Obama administration will release a public version of
its intelligence assessment today, according to an
administration official, who asked for anonymity because the
publication hasn’t been officially announced.  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery fell a
second straight day, dropping 33 cents to $108.47 a barrel on
the Nymex, after reaching a two-year high of $110.10 two days
ago.  October Futures  September gasoline and diesel futures expire at the close
of floor trading today. The more-actively traded October
contract, which represents winter-grade gasoline, which can be
blended from a wider range of components, increasing supply,
slipped 1.42 cents to $2.9164 a gallon. Nymex floor trading will
be closed on Sept. 2 for the Labor Day holiday.  “It’s indicative of the end of the driving season and the
beginning of a period of lower demand,” Lipow said.  The motor fuel’s crack  spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 34 cents to $13.95 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent narrowed 68 cents to $7.25 a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 2.1 cents to $3.585
a gallon, the highest since Aug. 7, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said today on its website. Retail prices are 24.1 cents below a
year earlier, AAA data show.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery fell 0.16
cent to $3.1833 a gallon on trading volume that was 20 percent
below the 100-day average. Futures have risen 4.6 percent this
month. The October contract declined 0.21 cent to $3.1862.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 21 cents to $25.32 a
barrel. The  premium over Brent  fell 11 cents to $18.64.  To contact the reporter on this story:
