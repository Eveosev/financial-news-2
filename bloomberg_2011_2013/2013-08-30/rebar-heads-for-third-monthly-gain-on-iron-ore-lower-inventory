Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai advanced toward a third monthly gain, supported by
lower inventory and higher prices for  iron ore .  Rebar for January delivery rose as much as 0.4 percent to
3,765 yuan ($615) a metric ton and traded at 3,757 yuan at 10:05
a.m. local time. Futures have gained 3.1 percent this month.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was little
changed yesterday at $138.30 a dry ton, bringing this month’s
gain to 6.5 percent, according to a  price index  compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd.  Rebar inventory  in China fell by 3.4 percent
this month to 6.6 million tons on Aug. 23, according to Shanghai
Steelhome Information Technology Co.  “Rebar’s fundamentals are turning positive,” said Dang
Man, analyst at Maike Futures Co. in Xi’an. “The market may
face some correction due to Syria and uncertainties in other
financial markets, but the demand outlook has improved with more
construction.”  The average spot price of rebar was little changed
yesterday at 3,606  yuan  a ton, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
