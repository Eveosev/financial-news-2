China Datang Corp. Renewable Power
Co. (1798) , a wind project developer, said first-half profit more than
doubled as increased grid capacity allowed output to expand.  Net income rose to 231 million  yuan  ($38 million) from 103
million yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said
today in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Sales gained
35 percent to 2.76 billion yuan.  The company is “actively expanding electricity capacity
potential,” Datang Renewables said. Its wind-power generation
jumped 38 percent as installed capacity rose 5 percent.  A slowdown in Chinese wind-farm development is easing grid
congestion and boosting operators’ profits as projects are able
to generate power closer to their installed capacity. Wind-power
installations in the nation may fall 6 percent to 13 gigawatts
this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates.  Datang Renewables climbed 5.7 percent to close at HK$1.67
in Hong Kong trading today before the results were announced.  While 19 percent of the company’s wind-power production
went to waste in the first half because the grid couldn’t accept
it, that’s 7 percentage points lower than a year earlier, the
statement shows.  The reduction in network congestion has also benefited
domestic competitor Huaneng Renewables Corp., which said Aug. 20
that first-half profit more than doubled to 646.1 million yuan
from a year earlier.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
