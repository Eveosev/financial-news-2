The Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry is requesting a 62 percent increase in the clean energy
budget for next fiscal year amid a push to diversify  Japan ’s
energy mix.  The ministry wants to allocate 198.1 billion yen ($2
billion) in the year starting April 1 “for the maximum
installations of clean energy,” according to a budget request
released today.  The amount includes 46.2 billion yen to strengthen the
country’s power grid to integrate more clean energy, according
to a ministry document. That’s an increase of 29 percent from
last year’s budget for similar purposes.  The trade ministry also wants to set aside 84.3 billion
yen, almost double last year’s budget, for technology
development and feasibility studies for such energy sources as
offshore wind and geothermal.  Japan’s Ministry of the Environment yesterday requested
43.5 billion yen in next fiscal year’s budget to create a low-carbon society using clean energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
