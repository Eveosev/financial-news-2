Two people were reported killed and
dozens injured as  Egypt ’s Muslim Brotherhood held rallies in
cities across Egypt as the group struggles to regain its footing
amid a security crackdown.  Several thousand people heeded calls by the Brotherhood and
protested in Cairo and other cities against the army ouster of
Islamist President Mohamed Mursi two months ago. Police and
soldiers blocked key roads.  One person died in Port Said and another in Sharqia
province, according to officials and state media, and dozens
were injured in those and other regions. Police fired tear gas
to disperse protesters in several cities including Giza, Assiut,
Gharbiya and Alexandria. Earlier today, two policemen were
killed when gunmen in cars opened fire on a police station in
Cairo’s Heliopolis neighborhood, health officials said.  Violence spread across the country after the army-backed
government sent police to clear two Islamist protest camps in
Cairo and Giza earlier this month, killing hundreds. Since then
Brotherhood leaders have been targeted by a wave of arrests.  “The people want to execute the butcher,” protesters
yelled, according to footage on Al Jazeera’s Egyptian channel.
They were referring to army chief Abdelfatah al-Seesi, who led
the July 3 ouster of Mursi.  Three senior Brotherhood figures, including Mohamed El-Beltagy, were arrested yesterday. Security forces detained 140
Brotherhood supporters rallying in Qalyubia province today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
