The following is the text of
the second quarter GDP report released by Statistics  Canada .  Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 0.4% in the
second quarter, following 0.5% growth in the first quarter. On a
monthly basis, real GDP by industry declined 0.5% in June.  Final domestic demand rose 0.6% in the second quarter.
Household final consumption expenditure advanced 0.9%, led by
higher spending on durable goods (+3.2%) and services (+0.7%).  Government final consumption expenditure rose 0.6%, the
fourth consecutive quarterly gain.  Business gross fixed capital formation edged down 0.1% in
the second quarter, despite a 1.3% increase in investment in
residential structures.  Investment in non-residential structures and machinery and
equipment was 0.6% lower, while outlays on intellectual property
products declined 2.3%.  Exports edged up 0.2% in the second quarter, after
advancing 1.3% in the first quarter. Imports were up 0.4%,
following a 0.6% gain in the first quarter.  Inventory accumulation slowed in the second quarter as
businesses added $5.2 billion worth of goods to inventories,
down from the $7.7 billion added in the first quarter. The
economy-wide stock-to-sales ratio was unchanged from the
previous quarter.  The output of service industries expanded 0.7% in the
second quarter, while goods-producing industries fell 0.5%.  Notable increases were recorded in retail and wholesale
trade, the finance and insurance sector, professional services,
as well as in the output of real estate agents and brokers.  Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction decreased
1.7% in the second quarter, following two consecutive quarters
of growth. Declines also occurred in manufacturing, the fourth
quarterly decrease in a row, as well as in construction.  Expressed at an annualized rate, real GDP expanded 1.7% in
the second quarter. By comparison, real GDP in the United States
rose 2.5%.  Consumer spending boosted by vehicle purchases  Household final consumption expenditure advanced 0.9% in
the second quarter, the strongest pace since the fourth quarter
of 2010. Spending on goods was up 1.2%, led by durable goods
(+3.2%). Spending on services was 0.7% higher.  Transport purchases, which contributed over one-third of
the growth in household spending, were boosted by a 4.7%
increase in purchases of vehicles in the second quarter. This
was the fourth consecutive quarterly increase in vehicle
purchases, and the strongest advance since the first quarter of
2012.  Spending on insurance and financial services increased 1.4%,
reflecting in part higher claims as a result of extensive
flooding in Southern  Alberta  in the second half of June.  Food, beverage and accommodation services (+1.0%) and
recreation and culture (+0.8%) also contributed to the growth in
household spending.  Expenditures were notably lower on clothing and footwear (-
0.9%) and alcoholic beverages and tobacco (-0.5%).  Housing up after three quarters of contraction  Business gross fixed capital formation in residential
structures increased 1.3% in the second quarter, following three
consecutive quarterly declines. The increase stemmed from higher
resale activity, as ownership transfer costs went up 5.9%, and
renovations increased 1.6%. The value of new home construction
(-0.6%) declined for a second consecutive quarter.  Business outlays on plant and equipment turn down  Business gross fixed capital formation in non-residential
structures and machinery and equipment fell 0.6% in the second
quarter, following two consecutive quarterly increases.
Investment in non-residential structures declined 0.7%. The
decrease was driven by lower investment in non-residential
buildings (-2.6%), due in part to the construction strike in
 Quebec  during the last two weeks of June.  Business investment in machinery and equipment was down
0.5% in the second quarter, following a flat first quarter.
Industrial machinery and equipment (-1.2%) and computers and
computer peripheral equipment (-2.3%) were the main contributors
to the decline. Outlays on communications and audio and video
equipment (+5.7%) were notably higher.  Business inventory accumulation weaker than in the first quarter  Non-farm business inventories increased $3.4 billion in the
second quarter, down from the $9.0 billion added in the first
quarter.  There was a significant buildup of inventory at the
wholesale level, as wholesalers added to their stocks of durable
and non-durable goods during the quarter. Retailers ran down
their inventories of motor vehicles and other durable goods.
Manufacturers also depleted their inventories.  Farm inventories increased $1.4 billion, reflecting good
growing conditions for grains and other crops in the first half
of the year. This increase followed declines in the previous six
quarters.  Government spending continues to expand  Government real final consumption expenditure rose 0.6% in
the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarterly gain.
Federal and local government spending were the main contributors
to the increase in the second quarter.  Federal spending advanced 1.9%, the first increase since
the fourth quarter of 2011. Local government spending (+1.0%)
continued up.  Expenditures by provincial and territorial governments were
flat, following three quarterly increases.  Exports edge up following a strong first quarter  Exports of goods and services edged up by 0.2% in the
second quarter, following a 1.3% gain in the first quarter.  Exports of goods advanced 0.4%, after growing 1.2% in the
first quarter. Metal and non-metallic mineral products (+4.8%),
basic and industrial chemical, plastic and rubber products
(+6.4%), and motor vehicles and parts (+3.2%) were among the
major contributors to the increase.  Exports of energy products (-6.3%) and farm, fishing and
intermediate food products (-6.5%) were notably lower.  Service exports decreased 0.8%, following a 1.7% gain in
the first quarter. The decrease was driven by lower exports of
commercial services (-1.8%).  Imports advance at a slower pace than in the first quarter  Imports of goods and services grew 0.4% in the second
quarter, after increasing 0.6% in the first quarter. Imports
have increased in all but one quarter since the second quarter
of 2009. The exception was the fourth quarter of 2012 (-0.8%).  Imports of goods advanced 0.8%. Electronic and electrical
equipment and parts (+7.9%), motor vehicles and parts (+3.0%)
and metal and non-metallic mineral products (+1.6%) were among
the main sources of strength.  Imports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals (-20.6%)
and forestry products and building and packaging materials (-
4.2%) were among the main sources of weakness.  Imports of services decreased 1.6%, the third consecutive
quarterly decline. Imports of commercial services (-4.0%) also
fell for a third consecutive quarter.  Economy-wide income grows at slowest pace in four quarters  Nominal GDP grew 0.4% in the second quarter. This followed
a 1.0% increase in the first quarter, and gains of 0.7% in the
two previous quarters.  Compensation of employees rose 0.9%, following a 0.8% gain
in the first quarter. Wages and salaries were up by 1.4% in
goods-producing industries and by 0.8% in service-producing
industries in the second quarter.  The net operating surplus of corporations fell 4.4% in the
second quarter. That of non-financial corporations fell 5.1%,
after gaining 0.7% in the first quarter. This was the fifth
contraction in six quarters in this sector. However, financial
corporations’ net operating surplus increased 2.7% in the second
quarter.  Household saving rate lower  Household final consumption expenditure (in current
dollars) increased (+1.0%) at a faster pace than household
disposable income (+0.8%) in the second quarter. The household
saving rate was 5.1%, down from 5.3% in the first quarter.  The household debt service ratio, defined as household
mortgage and non-mortgage interest paid divided by disposable
income, was 7.15% in the second quarter, down from 7.26% in the
first quarter and from the average rate of 7.3% recorded in 2012.  The national saving rate was 4.0% in the second quarter,
down from 5.0% in the first quarter. The decrease stemmed mainly
from the sharply lower savings of non-financial corporations.  Weaker terms of trade restrain gains in real domestic income  A weakening in Canada’s terms of trade, resulting from
lower prices for exports relative to imports, restrained the
growth in real gross domestic income to 0.2% in the second
quarter.  Export prices declined by 0.2% while import prices were
0.6% higher. The overall price of goods and services produced in
Canada edged down 0.1%.  The price of final domestic demand rose 0.2%, after growing
0.5% in the first quarter.  Gross domestic product by industry, June 2013  Following five consecutive monthly increases, real gross
domestic product fell 0.5% in June, as many major industrial
sectors recorded lower production. Notable declines were
recorded in construction, wholesale and retail trade, and
manufacturing. Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction,
the arts and entertainment sector as well as transportation and
accommodation services also decreased in June. However, the
output of real estate agents and brokers and insurance carriers
increased.  Construction declined 1.9% in June, partly because of a
labour dispute in Quebec. Non-residential building construction
fell 7.3%. Residential building construction, as well as repair
and engineering construction, also declined.  After posting strong increases in May, both wholesale and
retail trade were down in June. Wholesale trade fell 2.4% as
decreases were widespread. Notable declines were registered by
miscellaneous wholesalers, which includes agricultural supplies,
and in building materials and supplies. Retail trade was down
1.4% in June, following three consecutive monthly increases.
Food and beverage stores, as well as motor vehicle and parts
dealers contributed the most to the decline in June after having
both increased in May.  Manufacturing production declined 1.3% in June, as durable
goods fell 2.6% while non-durable goods increased 0.3%. Declines
were recorded in 15 out of 19 major manufacturing sub-sectors,
with notable decreases in machinery, fabricated metal products,
and beverage and tobacco products. In contrast, output at
refineries increased significantly in June, following the end of
maintenance work at some facilities in April and May.  Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction declined 0.3%.
The increase in oil and gas production was outweighed by
decreases in potash and coal mining as well as support
activities for mining and oil and gas extraction.  The arts and entertainment sector declined 4.3%, as
attendance at sporting events was down in June.  The output of real estate agents and brokers was up for the
fourth consecutive month, as activity in the home resale market
increased in almost all major urban markets.  Services provided by insurance carriers increased in June,
in part due to flooding in Alberta.  Note to readers  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends

statistics (such as personal expenditures, investment, exports,
imports and output) are calculated from volume measures that are
adjusted for price variations. Percentage changes for income-based and flow-of-funds statistics (such as labour income,
corporate profits, mortgage borrowing and total funds raised)
are calculated from nominal values; that is, they are not
adjusted for price variations.  There are four ways of expressing growth rates for gross
domestic product (GDP) and other time series found in this
release.  1. Unless otherwise stated, the growth rates of all
quarterly data in this release represent the percentage change
in the series from one quarter to the next, such as from the
first quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2013.  2. Quarterly growth can be expressed at an annual rate by
using a compound growth formula, similar to the way in which a
monthly interest rate can be expressed at an annual rate.
Expressing growth at an annual rate facilitates comparisons with
official GDP statistics from the United States. Both the
quarterly growth rate and the annualized quarterly growth rate
should be interpreted as an indication of the latest trend in
GDP.  3. The year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change
in GDP from a given quarter in one year to the same quarter one
year later, such as from the second quarter of 2012 to the
second quarter of 2013.  4. The growth rates of all monthly data in this article
represent the percentage change in the series from one month to
the next, such as from May to June 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
