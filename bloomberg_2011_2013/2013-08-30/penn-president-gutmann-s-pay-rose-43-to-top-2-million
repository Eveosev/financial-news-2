University of Pennsylvania President
 Amy Gutmann  received compensation valued at $2.09 million in the
year ended June 2012, up 43 percent from a year earlier.  Gutmann’s total pay rose from $1.46 million in the period
ended June 2011, according to tax reports filed by Philadelphia-based Penn. At that time, she was the third-highest paid college
president in the eight-member Ivy League, after Columbia
University’s  Lee Bollinger  and Yale University’s  Richard Levin ,
and the 12th-highest-paid university president in the U.S.,
according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.  Gutmann’s pay package for the year ended June 2012 included
$1.08 million in base salary, up 18 percent, and $1.01 million
in other compensation and benefits. She was paid more than twice
as much as Harvard University President Drew Faust, a former
Penn history professor who received $899,734, including about
$129,000 for the use of a home, in the same year.  “We have the best university president in the country in
Amy Gutmann and we believe her compensation should reflect that
reality,” said  David Cohen , chairman of Penn’s Board of
Trustees. “Dr. Gutmann’s compensation is very much performance
driven, and speaks to the extraordinary success that she has had
in recent years.”  Tax reports from the nonprofit universities’ most recent
fiscal year aren’t yet available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
