Asian currencies fell for a fourth
month, led by  India ’s rupee and  Indonesia ’s rupiah, as investors
pulled money from regional assets on slowing economic growth and
an expected reduction in stimulus by the Federal Reserve.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index lost 1.1 percent
in August, the biggest drop since May. The rupee was poised for
its worst week since 1992 and the rupiah headed for its biggest
decline in five years as analysts cut expansion forecasts for
the two economies. Foreign funds pulled $4.5 billion from
Taiwanese, Thai, Indian and Indonesian stocks in August,
exchange data show, as 65 percent of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the Fed will start to taper next month.  “Overall weak sentiment continues as Asian economies have
to show really good numbers to encourage investors,” said Nalin Chutchotitham, a Bangkok-based analyst at  Kasikornbank Pcl. (KBANK)   The rupee weakened 10 percent this month to 67.205 per
dollar as of 9:07 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rupiah dropped 5.9 percent to 10,920, the
Philippine peso declined 2.7 percent to 44.655 and  Thailand ’s
baht lost 2.6 percent to 32.11.  Standard Chartered Plc cut its 2013-2014 growth forecast
for India to 4.7 percent from 5.5 percent yesterday, while UBS
AG this week reduced its estimate for Indonesia’s 2013 growth to
5.6 percent from 6 percent. Thailand entered a recession for the
first time since 2009, contracting 0.3 percent in the second
quarter from the previous three months, when it decreased 1.7
percent, official data show.  Emergency Measures  The rupee had its biggest gain since 1986 yesterday on
speculation a central bank plan to supply dollars to the largest
oil buyers would cool demand for foreign exchange, although the
currency resumed falling today.  “Sharp weakness in the India rupee is starting to weigh on
India’s economy,” analysts at Standard Chartered led by London-based Priyanka Kishore wrote in a report on Aug. 29. “The
global backdrop remains challenging due to Fed tapering
concerns.”  The rupiah advanced after Bank Indonesia raised its
 benchmark interest rate  yesterday to a four-year high in an
unscheduled move to stem exchange-rate weakness. The reference
rate was boosted by 50 basis points to 7 percent, before a Sept.
2 report that economists predict will show faster inflation.  “Bank Indonesia’s move seeks to preempt August inflation,
which may reflect the impact of a weaker rupiah,” said  Gundy
Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in
 Singapore . “The initial market response has been positive.”  Ringgit Weakens  Malaysia ’s ringgit headed for its fourth monthly drop as
the nation’s deteriorating current-account position spurred
concern among investors. The surplus in the broadest measure of
trade shrank 70 percent to 2.6 billion ringgit ($787 million) in
the second quarter, data showed last week. The ringgit weakened
1.7 percent in August to 3.3005 per dollar.  “The Fed’s taper has shifted the market’s focus to
emerging-market asset values and imbalances such as the
deterioration in current accounts,” said  Nizam Idris , the head
of fixed income and currency strategy at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in
Singapore. “The market is re-pricing Malaysia’s assets.”  Elsewhere in Asia,  China ’s  yuan  rose 0.1 percent this
month to 6.1204 per dollar. South Korea’s won gained 1.2 percent
to 1,109.5,  Taiwan ’s dollar advanced 0.7 percent to NT$29.925
and Vietnam’s dong strengthened 0.2 percent to 21,130.  To contact the reporter on this story:
