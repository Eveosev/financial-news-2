Thailand ’s baht was poised for its
fifth monthly decline, the longest losing streak in five years,
after foreigners cut holdings of the nation’s assets as the
 Federal Reserve  prepares to reduce stimulus. Bonds dropped.  The baht touched a three-year low this week as data showed
 exports (THCTEXPY)  fell for a third month in July and manufacturing
production dropped. Global funds pulled $2.7 billion from Thai
bonds and stocks in August, official data show. The currency
gained today as the prospect of an imminent strike against  Syria 
diminished, reducing the chance oil supplies will be disrupted.  “Export numbers are still disappointing for Thailand,
keeping underlying sentiment for the currency weak for a
while,” said Nalin Chutchotitham, a Bangkok-based analyst at
Kasikornbank Pcl.  The baht lost 2.6 percent this month to 32.1 per dollar as
of 9:31 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency rose 0.3 percent today, paring its weekly decline
to 0.8 percent. It has lost 8.8 percent since the end of March
and touched 32.31 on Aug. 28, the weakest since Aug. 2, 2010.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 90 basis points
this month to 7.18 percent. It declined six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, today.  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  failed to gain
parliamentary backing for military action against Syria
yesterday. The Fed will begin to slow bond purchases at its Sept.
17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Deficit Forecast  Thailand will post a current-account deficit of $475
million in July, after a shortfall of $664 million the previous
month, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey before data due today. Exports fell 1.5 percent
last month and manufacturing production dropped 4.5 percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent sovereign bonds due June
2023 climbed 36 basis points in August to 4.34 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield rose 16 basis points this
week and fell four basis points today. It reached 4.39 percent
on Aug. 28, the  highest  level for a benchmark 10-year security
since November 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
