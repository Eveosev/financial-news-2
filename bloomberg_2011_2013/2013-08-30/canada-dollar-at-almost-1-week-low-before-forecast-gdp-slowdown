The Canadian dollar touched its
lowest point this week before a report forecast to show the
economy contracted in June by the most since 2009 after the U.S.
reported yesterday a pick-up in growth.  The currency fluctuated against its U.S. peer before the
data, which are projected to show gross domestic product
contracted 0.4 percent in June after a 0.2 percent expansion the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of 21
economists. The number would bring second-quarter growth to 1.6
percent at an annual rate from 2.5 percent the previous period,
a separate survey showed. Economic growth in the U.S., the
nation’s biggest trade partner, exceeded projections from April
through June.  “If Canada looks like it’s lagging behind, then people
will probably think underperformance and hence the Canadian
dollar falls further behind,” said Don Mikolich, executive
director of foreign-exchange sales at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, by phone from Toronto. “We did go through a rough
patch in this past quarter.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, was little
changed at C$1.0531 per U.S. dollar at 7:47 a.m. in Toronto,
after falling as low as C$1.0541, the lowest level this week.
