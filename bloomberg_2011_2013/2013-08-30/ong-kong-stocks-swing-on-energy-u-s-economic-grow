Hong Kong   stocks  swung between gains
and losses as energy producers fell after  oil prices  slid and as
U.S. growth encouraged investors. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co.
advanced after posting higher profit.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  was little changed at 21,698.54 as of
9:34 a.m. in Hong Kong after rising as much as 0.1 percent. The
gauge is headed for a 0.9 percent monthly drop ahead of expected
cuts to U.S. stimulus. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index
fell 0.2 percent to 9,835.17.  Hong Kong’s equity benchmark retreated 4.2 percent this
year through yesterday, the worst performer among developed
markets tracked by Bloomberg. The gauge traded at 10.39 times
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 14.87 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.69 on the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, dropped 19 percent through yesterday from a Feb. 1
high after China’s growth slowed for two quarters. The measure
traded at 1.18 times book value yesterday, compared with a five-year average of 1.77.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent today. The U.S.
equity gauge rose 0.2 percent yesterday after official data
showed economic growth rose at a 2.5 percent annualized rate, up
from an initial estimate of 1.7 percent. Jobless claims dropped
by 6,000 to 331,000 last week, beating estimates.  The  Federal Reserve  has said any reduction in stimulus will
be tied to signs of sustained economic recovery. The central
bank is expected to pare asset purchases in September by $10
billion to a $75 billion monthly pace, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg on Aug. 9-13.  The prospect of imminent strikes on Syria eased
after U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron failed to get
parliamentary approval for military action against the regime
for alleged use of chemical weapons. The U.S., which says it has
evidence  Syria ’s government was responsible, won’t act without
allies, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
