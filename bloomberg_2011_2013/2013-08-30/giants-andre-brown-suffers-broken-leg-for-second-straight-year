New York  Giants running back Andre Brown broke a bone in his left leg for the second straight
National Football League season and is out indefinitely.  Brown was injured late in the first half of last night’s
final preseason game, a 28-20 loss to the New England Patriots.  Giants coach Tom Coughlin said Brown, the backup to
starting running back David Wilson, will be out “a while”
after suffering a small fracture in his leg. Brown broke his
left fibula last season in a Nov. 25 win against Green Bay.  “It doesn’t require surgery or anything of that nature and
that is a positive,” Brown told reporters. “I’m looking
forward to making sure that everything is good with it, rehab
well and most definitely I will be back. I just got a helmet
straight to it and it’s just a little bump in the road.”  The Giants open the regular season on Sept. 8 at the Dallas
Cowboys. They will host the Denver Broncos on Sept. 15.  Brown, 26, rushed for 385 yards and eight touchdowns for
the Giants last season while averaging 5.3 yards a carry. The
other running backs on the Giants’ roster are Ryan Torain,
Da’Rel Scott and seventh-round draft pick Michael Cox.  “I was impressed by Da’Rel,” Coughlin said after Scott
rushed for 25 yards on four carries last night and also caught a
scoring pass. “We know that Michael Cox is a hard runner and we
know that Ryan Torain is a hard runner. Those are the people on
our roster that are not injured, so they have a job to do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
