California ’s ban on the sale of foie
gras, made from the livers of force-fed ducks, remains in effect
after a U.S. appeals court upheld a lower-court decision not to
block the law.  A three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in San
Francisco today rejected arguments that the measure interferes
with interstate and foreign commerce and is too vague. The court
sent the case back to a federal judge in Los Angeles.  An association of producers who supply all of  Canada ’s foie
gras imports to the U.S. and Hudson Valley Foie Gras LLC, the
largest U.S. producer of foie gras, had sued to stop the 2004
law. It bans force-feeding ducks or geese to make foie gras
within California and bars sales of foie gras produced elsewhere
if it’s made by force-feeding a bird to enlarge its liver beyond
normal size.  Violators can be fined as much as $1,000 a day. Enforcement
was postponed to allow producers to find an alternative to
force-feeding. None was found.  The case is Association des Eleveurs de Canards et d’Oies
du Quebec v. Harris, 12-56822, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
