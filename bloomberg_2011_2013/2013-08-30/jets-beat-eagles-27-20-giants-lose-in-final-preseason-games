Kahlil Bell scored on runs of eight
and two yards as the New York Jets completed their preseason
with a 27-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.  Also last night at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro,
 Massachusetts , Tim Tebow threw touchdown passes of 52 and nine
yards to Quentin Sims in the fourth quarter as the New England
Patriots defeated the New York Giants 28-20.  “We did some things well, some things we can try to
improve on,” Tebow told reporters. “Me personally, same goes.
You just try to keep getting better every single week and I
thought we made some strides.”  Jets quarterback Matt Simms completed 33 of 44 passing
attempts for 285 yards as Mark Sanchez and Geno Smith sat out
the game. Matt Barkley completed 13 passes for 134 yards and one
interception for the Eagles.  Matthew Tucker scored touchdowns for the Eagles on runs of
three yards and one yard, the second one with 27 seconds left in
the game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New York.  The Jets host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in their National
Football League season opener on Sept. 8, the same day the
Giants visit the Dallas Cowboys, who lost 24-6 to the Houston
Texans last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
