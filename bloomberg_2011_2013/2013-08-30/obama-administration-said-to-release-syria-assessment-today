The Obama administration plans to
release a declassified report outlining an intelligence analysis
of evidence that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in
an attack, an administration official said.  The administration will release the assessment sometime
today, according to the official, who asked for anonymity to
discuss the matter before it’s made public.  The report is the next step in President  Barack Obama ’s
effort to justify punishing the regime of Bashar al-Assad for
the Aug. 21 attack outside Damascus that opposition forces say
killed more than 1,000 people.  Publication of the assessment follows last night’s vote in
the U.K.’s House of Commons rejecting British participation in a
military strike against  Syria . France has signaled it might act
as the main U.S. ally in a response.  To contact the reporters on this story:
