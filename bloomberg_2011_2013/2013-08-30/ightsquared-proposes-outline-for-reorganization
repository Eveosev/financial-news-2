Philip Falcone’s LightSquared Inc.
proposed a reorganization that includes a potential sale of
wireless spectrum instead of an auction led with a $2.2 billion
bid from a unit of Charlie Ergen’s  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)   LightSquared filed the plan outline today in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan  and said it will continue to seek
approval from the Federal Communications Commission to use its
airwaves. The company said it also will weigh a sale of the
assets and didn’t identify any potential bidders.  LightSquared’s proposal before the FCC “represents the
best, immediate option to use this spectrum for mobile
broadband,” Chief Executive Officer Doug Smith said in an e-mailed statement today. “While we hope the FCC does act
quickly, if it does not, the unfortunate outcome will be that
this opportunity to unlock this spectrum will disappear.”  The regulator is taking comments through Sept. 23 on
LightSquared’s proposal. The FCC filed court papers today saying
that it is the responsibility of two of the company’s units --
LightSquared Subsidiary LLC and One Dot Six Corp. -- or any
buyer to comply with all of its rules and regulations.  Earlier today, LightSquared filed a general outline of how
creditors should evaluate competing plans for the company. One
plan, already filed by a group of lenders to its LP unit,
proposes an auction with the Dish unit as lead bidder.  FCC Decision  LightSquared filed for  bankruptcy protection  last year
after the FCC blocked its initial proposal to use the spectrum,
concluding it would interfere with navigation gear that uses the
global positioning system. LightSquared in September revised its
plan to avoid interference by using other airwaves..  Yesterday, LightSquared’s lender group said the company
shouldn’t be allowed to run its own bankruptcy auction, citing
depleted cash, a changing industry and a controlling shareholder
who wants to block the sale.  The lenders, a trustee or an independent committee should
conduct the planned asset auction, the lenders said. Since the
Chapter 11 case began, LightSquared’s cash has dwindled by
$125 million to about $61 million, Steve Zelin of financial
adviser Blackstone Group LP said in support of the lenders.  A lawsuit filed by Falcone’s investment company, Harbinger
Capital Partners LLC, against Ergen and Dish shows Falcone wants
to keep control of LightSquared, Zelin said.  The lender group, which owns debt in the LP unit, includes
Capital Research & Management Co., Fir Tree Capital Opportunity
Master Funds LP, Cyrus Capital Partners LP, Intermarket Corp.,
 UBS AG (UBSN)  and SP Special Opportunities LLC, a fund owned by Ergen.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , filed for
bankruptcy in May 2012, listing assets of $4.48 billion and debt
of $2.29 billion.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
