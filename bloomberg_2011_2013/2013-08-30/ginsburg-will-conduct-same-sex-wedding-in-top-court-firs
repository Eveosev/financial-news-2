Justice  Ruth Bader Ginsburg  will
officiate at a same-sex wedding tomorrow in a first for a member
of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Ginsburg will conduct the Washington wedding of her friend
Michael M. Kaiser, the president of the Kennedy Center, and  John
Roberts , said Kathy Arberg, the Supreme Court’s spokeswoman.
Roberts isn’t related to the high court’s chief justice, John G. Roberts. The Washington Post reported Ginsburg’s role earlier
today.  Ginsburg was in the majority when the court backed the gay-marriage movement in a pair of 5-4 decisions in June. The
rulings stopped short of legalizing gay marriage across the
country, as advocates had sought.  “The court handled both of those cases just the way they
should have,” Ginsburg said in an interview last week.  Same-sex marriages have been legal in  Washington  since
2010. Thirteen states recognize gay marriages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
