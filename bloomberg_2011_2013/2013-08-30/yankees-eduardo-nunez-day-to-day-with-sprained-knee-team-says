New York Yankees infielder  Eduardo Nunez  is “day-to-day” as he recovers from a sprained knee when
he caught his cleat in a seam on artificial turf at the Toronto
Blue Jays’ ballpark.  Nunez’s scan on his knee yesterday was negative, the Major
League Baseball team said.  Nunez, 26, twisted his right knee in the eighth inning of
the Yankees’ 7-1 win over the Blue Jays on Aug. 27. He had
replaced second baseman  Robinson Cano , who left the game in the
first inning after being hit in the left hand by a fastball.  The Yankees, who were idle last night, begin a three-game
series against the Baltimore Orioles tonight at Yankee Stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
