Spain’s  current-account  surplus
increased in June, signaling progress in Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s plan for an  export boom  and tourism to lift the euro
region’s fourth-largest economy out of recession.  The surplus of 2.57 billion euros ($3.4 billion) follows
one of 2.4 billion euros in May, data released today by the Bank
of Spain in Madrid show. The country had a deficit of 981
million euros in June 2012.  Spain’s current account registered a surplus of 1.36
billion euros over the first half of the year, compared with a
deficit of 17 billion euros over the same period in 2012.  The Spanish government predicts a  recession  that started in
2011 will end this year. Deputy Trade Minister Jaime Garcia-Legaz Ponce said last week that exports will rise to a record in
2013, citing an improvement in the country’s competitiveness.
 Unemployment (UMRTEMU)  dropped from its highest level in the nation’s
democratic history in the second quarter, while remaining the
second-highest in the 17-nation euro region, after  Greece , at 26
percent.  Ford Motor Co., the second-largest U.S. automaker,
confirmed last month that it’ll start manufacturing new models
at its plant in Valencia in the south east of Spain following an
accord with unions in April.  Foreign-portfolio investment fell in June, according to
Bank of Spain data. Non-residents withdrew 12.5 billion euros in
stock and bond investments, after an inflow of 4.1 billion in
May. Over the first six months of the year, outflows amounted to
16.2 billion euros, down from 92.7 billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
