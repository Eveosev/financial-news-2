Codelco, the world’s biggest copper
producer, said output from its own mines in  Chile  declined 1
percent in the first half from a year ago as century-old
Chuquicamata runs down its open-pit operations.  Output totaled 758,000 metric tons in the six-month period,
the company said in a statement distributed in Santiago today.
Including the state-owned company’s share of copper from mines
operated by  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  and  Anglo
American Plc. (AAL) , production rose to 843,000 from 803,000 tons.  The company, based in Santiago, operates some of the
world’s oldest mines, including Chuquicamata, first exploited by
the Guggenheim family in the 1900s, where Codelco wants to build
a  tunnel network to access ore underneath an open-pit mine
already more than half a mile deep. Chief Executive Officer
Thomas Keller is seeking funding for a record investment plan
over the coming years to reach annual output of about 2.2
million tons as ore quality deteriorates.  First-half output declines at the Chuquicamata, Salvador
and Andina mines were countered by increases at El Teniente and
Gabriela Mistral, Codelco said. An expansion at El Teniente, now
the most productive operation, is 13 percent complete.  Keller cut this year’s capital expenditure budget to $4
billion from $5 billion after the government approved less
funding than the company requested. Copper prices are “still
attractive” and Codelco won’t halt investments that are already
under way, he told reporters today in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
