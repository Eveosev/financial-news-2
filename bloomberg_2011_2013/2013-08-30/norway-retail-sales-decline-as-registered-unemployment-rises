Norwegian retail sales fell for a
second month in July and a report showed registered unemployment
rose this month, adding to evidence the economy of western
 Europe â€™s largest oil exporter is slowing.  Retail sales, excluding motor vehicles, slumped 1.3 percent
in the month, after falling 0.2 percent in June, Oslo-based
 Statistics Norway  said today. Sales were estimated to rise 0.2
percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of eight economists.  A report today also showed that registered unemployment was
unchanged at 2.8 percent in August, compared with 2.6 percent a
year earlier, according to the Norwegian Labor and Welfare
Service. Unemployment was seen at 2.7 percent, according to the
median estimate of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose to 70,210 from 69,284
people in July, the agency said. A report from the statistics
agency showed surveyed unemployment fell to 3.3 percent in June.  The krone weakened 0.44 percent to 8.1023 per euro as of
10:27 a.m. in Oslo.  Policy makers held their benchmark deposit rate unchanged
at 1.5 percent in June, signaling a possible rate cut in
September to support growth and prevent inflation from slowing
further. Data has since revealed higher-than-estimated
industrial production and inflation, cooling speculation of a
rate cut next month.  Norges Bank will publish its next rate decision Sept. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
