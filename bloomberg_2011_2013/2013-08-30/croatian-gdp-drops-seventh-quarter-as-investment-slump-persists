Croatia’s economy contracted for a
seventh quarter on an annual basis as declines in investment and
consumption persisted in the European Union’s newest member.  Gross domestic product shrank a preliminary 0.7 percent
from a year earlier between April and June after dropping 1.5
percent in the first three months of the year, the  statistics
office , based in the capital, Zagreb, said today on its website.
Final GDP data will be published on Sept. 10.  “The negative trend in  capital investment  and exports is
going to continue, aggravated by somewhat decreased revenue from
tourism this season,” Zdeslav Santic, chief economist at  Soc-Gen Splitska Banka d.d.,  said by phone from Zagreb before the
release. The economy may contract 1.2 percent this year before a
“modest recovery” in 2014, he said.  The Adriatic nation, which joined the EU in July, has
endured an economic contraction of more than 10 percent since
2008, during which time foreign direct investment has plunged 80
percent. GDP will grow 0.7 percent this year, the  government 
predicted in February, trimming a previous 1.8 percent forecast.
The economy will contract 1 percent in 2013, according to the
European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
