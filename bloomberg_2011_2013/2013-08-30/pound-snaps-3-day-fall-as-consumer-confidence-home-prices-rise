momentum in the economy,” said  Lee Hardman , a currency
strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London .

could start to turn.”  The pound appreciated 0.1 percent to 85.33 pence per euro

make our views known in terms of the degree of this risk and the
potential action that should be taken to address it,” Carney
said in an interview with the  Daily Mail  published today.  The British Chambers of Commerce raised its economic
forecasts today and said  gross domestic product  will increase
