You’ve seen the splashy ads featuring names like  Daniel Craig , Mary-Louise Parker and “Big Fish.” Now it’s time to check out the musicals, comedies and dramas vying for your attention and cash this fall. Here’s my selection of the most enticing.  Song, Dance  Two popular film comedies will show up as musicals.  On Broadway, “Big Fish,” with songs by Andrew Lippa (“The Addams Family”) and book by John August (“Frankenweenie”) rolls in from its Chicago tryout with optimistic advance word for stars Norbert Leo Butz as a yarn spinner; his adoring wife (Kate Baldwin); and his skeptical son (Bobby Steggert). Susan Stroman directs and choreographs.  (Previews begin Sept. 5 at the Neil Simon Theatre;  http://www.bigfishthemusical.com )  Off-Broadway’s estimable Second Stage will present “Little Miss Sunshine,” about the girl-who-would-be-beauty-queen. The show reunites James Lapine (direction and book) with song writer William Finn; their collaborations include “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” and “Falsettos.”  (Previews begin Oct. 15;  http://www.2st.com .)  Wynton Marsalis  While Jason Robert Brown’s “Bridges of Madison County” isn’t due until later in the season, his long-gestating “Honeymoon in Vegas” gets a tryout across the Hudson at  New Jersey ’s Paper Mill Playhouse.  (Previews begin Sept. 26;  http://www.papermill.org .)  Harlem’s Cotton Club era is recalled in “After Midnight,” a collaboration by Jazz at  Lincoln Center ’s Wynton Marsalis, City Center’s Jack Viertel and fashion designers Isabel and Ruben Toledo. Warren Carlyle does double duty as director and choreographer.  (Previews begin Oct. 18 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre;  http://www.aftermidnightbroadway.com .)  Big Affairs  Revivals with bold-face names abound.  Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad (you can choose which one’s the prettier) have begun previews in “Romeo and Juliet,” staged by David Leveaux in a production that retains Shakespeare’s language but updates the action.  (Opens Sept. 19 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre;  http://www.romeoandjulietbroadway.com .)  You surely know by now that Daniel Craig,  Rachel Weisz  and Rafe Spall are starring in  Mike Nichols ’s revival of “Betrayal,” Harold Pinter’s tale-told-backwards of a good marriage and the affair that wrecks it.  (Previews begin Oct. 1 at the Barrymore Theatre;  http://betrayalbroadway.com .)  John Grisham makes his Broadway debut with Rupert Holmes’s adaptation of “A Time to Kill.” Staged by Ethan McSweeny, the drama stars Fred Dalton Thompson and Tonya Pinkins.

Double Dipping  Sirs  Ian McKellen  and  Patrick Stewart  will lead rotating productions of Pinter’s “No Man’s Land” and  Samuel Beckett ’s “Waiting for Godot,” staged by Sean Matthias. Billy Crudup and Shuler Hensley also star.  (Begins previews Oct. 26 at the Cort Theatre;  http://www.twoplaysinrep.com .)

Not to be outdone, Part II: The  Public Theater  will present the last of Richard Nelson’s brilliant, intimate Apple family plays -- this one set in real time on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of  John F. Kennedy . Then all four will run in rotating rep with the same extraordinary ensemble of actors.  (Previews begin Oct. 22;  http://www.publictheater.org .)
