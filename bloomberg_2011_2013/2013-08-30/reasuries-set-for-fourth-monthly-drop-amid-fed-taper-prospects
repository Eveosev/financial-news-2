Treasuries declined for a fourth
straight month, the longest losing streak in more than two
years, as signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering backed the case
for the  Federal Reserve  to reduce monetary stimulus.  Benchmark 10-year note yields fell this week amid
speculation possible U.S. military action against  Syria  may spur
refuge demand. President  Barack Obama  said Syria’s use of
chemical weapons is a direct threat to U.S. and global security.
He said he hasn’t made a final decision on his response while
“in no event” will it involve U.S. troops on the ground in
Syria. A report Sept. 6 is forecast to show U.S. nonfarm
payrolls rose this month. The Fed announced its September
schedule to buy as much as $45 billion in Treasuries.  “We are chopping around because of uncertainty on Syria
and retaliation,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe
Generale SA in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “A lot will hinge on the next payroll
report. The Fed may taper if the number comes in around plus
200,000.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.78 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
having increased 21 basis points this month, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.5 percent
benchmark note maturing in August 2023 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per
$1,000 face amount, to 97 17/32.  The 30-year bond yield dropped two basis points to 3.7
percent.  U.S. financial markets will be shut Sept. 2 for Labor Day.  Trading Pace  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped to $322 billion,
from $348 billion yesterday. The figure is down from a 2013 high
of $662 billion reached on May 22 and up from a low of $148
billion on Aug. 9. The 2013 average is $313 billion.  U.S. government securities lost 0.7 percent in August,
after declining 3.5 percent during the previous three months,
according to the Bloomberg U.S.  Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY)  The four-month losing streak is the longest since the period ended March
2011.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  increased 
net-short position in 10-year note futures to the most since May
2012, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 110,825 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade in the week ending Aug. 27.  Minutes of the Fed’s July FOMC meeting released on Aug. 21
showed policy makers were “broadly comfortable” with Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to taper purchases this year if the
economy strengthens, with a few saying a reduction may be needed
soon.  Jobs Watch  “Assuming a slightly better NFP print, we’d expect
tapering to be announced,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond
strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“It’s just a question of size and composition.”  U.S. payrolls rose 180,000 this month, and the jobless rate
held at 7.4 percent, according to economists surveyed before the
Labor Department reports the figures next week.  The Fed will trim its monthly purchases of $85 billion at
the next scheduled meeting Sept. 17-18, according to 65 percent
of economists in a Bloomberg survey this month.  The securities scheduled to be purchased by the central
bank during September should have an average duration of
approximately nine years, and will be concentrated in the seven-to 10-year and 20- to 30-year sectors, according to Stone &
McCarthy Research Associates, an economic advisory company in
Princeton,  New Jersey .  Auction Action  Investors bid for 2.43 times the amount of seven-year notes
for sale yesterday, the lowest ratio since May 2009. The five-year sale on Aug. 28 drew  bids  of $2.38 for every dollar sold in
debt, the least since July 2009. The Aug. 27 auction of $34
billion of two-year notes, the shortest maturity U.S. coupon
debt, attracted the most demand since April.  Treasuries were little changed today as consumer purchases,
which account for about 70 percent of the economy, rose 0.1
percent after a revised 0.6 percent increase the prior month
that was larger than previously estimated, the Commerce
Department reported today in  Washington . The median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.3 percent rise.
Incomes increased 0.1 percent.  The Commerce Department’s price index tied to spending, a
gauge tracked by Fed policy makers, increased 1.4 percent in
July from the same period in 2012. The core price measure, which
excludes volatile food and energy categories, rose 1.2 percent
from July 2012. The Fed has a target of 2 percent.  Price Pressure  “We do not have any evidence of increasing inflationary
pressures,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in
New York at Jefferies LLC, a primary dealer. “The year-over-year deflator is far below 2 percent.”  Consumer confidence  declined less than forecast in August.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment for this month fell to 82.1, from 85.1 in
July, which was the highest since July 2007. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey called for 80.5, according to the median
projection after a preliminary reading of 80.0.  U.S. government securities may also be supported by month-end buying to match market indexes. Funds that manage portfolios
against benchmark indexes, including the Barclays U.S. Aggregate
Index, typically buy longer-maturity Treasuries near the end of
the month to align the interest-rate sensitivity of their
holdings with the gauges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
