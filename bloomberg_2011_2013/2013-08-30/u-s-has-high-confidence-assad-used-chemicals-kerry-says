U.S. intelligence agencies have
“high confidence” that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s
forces used chemical weapons in an Aug. 21 attack that killed at
least 1,429 people, including 426 children, Secretary of State
 John Kerry  said.  Kerry spoke as the White House released a public version of
its intelligence assessment about last week’s attack in the
Ghouta area east of Damascus.  “Our choice today has great consequences,” Kerry told
reporters at the State Department in Washington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
