President  Barack Obama  will decide
on America’s response to a chemical weapons attack in Syria on
the U.S.’s own timeline, Secretary of State  John Kerry  said.  “President Obama will ensure that the  United States of
America  makes our own decisions on our own timelines,” Kerry
told reporters in Washington as the Obama administration
released an assessment saying intelligence agencies have “high
confidence” that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces used
chemical weapons in an Aug. 21 attack.  The attack, in the Ghouta area east of Damascus, killed at
least 1,429 people, including 426 children, Kerry said.  Kerry said the attack was a “crime against conscience”
and a “crime against humanity” that demands a response.  “This matters to us, and it matters to who we are, and it
matters to leadership and to our credibility in the world,”
Kerry said. “It matters here if nothing is done.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
