Suzano Papel e Celulose SA ,  Brazil ’s
best performing paper maker this year, headed to its third
straight weekly advance as the currency’s tumble boosts the
company’s revenue from exports.  Shares of Salvador-based Suzano  rose  1.9 percent to 9.30
reais at 12:55 p.m. in Sao Paulo, extending its weekly gain to
4.8 percent, the most among the 71 stocks on the Ibovespa. The
benchmark equity gauge  added  0.1 percent, paring a weekly
decline to 4.3 percent.  The real slumped 0.9 percent today, extending its plunge
this year to 14 percent and driving up the amount of reais that
exporters get for their dollars, as a jump in U.S. bond yields
lured money away from  emerging markets . Exports accounted for
more than half of Suzano’s second-quarter revenue.  “Exporters are benefiting from the currency depreciation
and their shares have being rising a lot for that reason,
especially paper makers,”  Pedro Galdi , the chief analyst at the
brokerage firm SLW Corretora, said in a phone interview from Sao
Paulo. “Revenue in dollars should mean better results for these
companies.”  Klabin SA, Latin America’s second-biggest paper maker by
sales, rose 0.1% to 12.15 reais, extending its weekly gain to
3.8 percent, the second best performance on the Ibovespa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
