Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. ’s
first-half loss narrowed after the nation’s biggest producer of
the lightweight metal halted some unprofitable production lines.  Net loss was 596.4 million  yuan  ($97 million) in the six
months ended June 30, compared with 3.25 billion yuan a year
earlier, the Beijing-based company said today in a statement,
citing international accounting standards. Sales climbed 6.9
percent to 76.6 billion yuan.  Aluminum Corp., known as  Chalco (2600) , is on course to report a
 second straight year  of loss this year even as the company said
it will sell aluminum-fabrication assets and will transfer loans
to parent Aluminum Corp. of  China . Chalco in June suspended some
aluminum output, affecting about 10 percent of its total
capacity.  “The oversupply across main products of the company hasn’t
eased,” putting pressure on prices, Chalco said in the
statement. The company said it is attempting to return to profit
in the second half.  Chalco slid 0.4 percent to close at HK$2.60 in  Hong Kong 
before the earnings announcement, extending this year’s decline
to 27 percent. The  Hang Seng Index  increased 0.1 percent today.  Aluminum prices in London dropped 12 percent this year amid
an industry glut. The metal for three-month delivery was down 1
percent to $1,818.25 a ton as of 4:40 p.m. Shanghai time.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
