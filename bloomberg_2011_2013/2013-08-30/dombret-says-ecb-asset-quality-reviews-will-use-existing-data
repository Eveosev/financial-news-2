Euro-area central bankers will
collect additional data to complement existing information about
banks’ balance sheets as they decide which assets will get extra
scrutiny in upcoming reviews, Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said.  “Portfolios with inherent risk will be picked based on
existing supervisory information and on a comprehensive data
survey,” Dombret said today in an e-mailed response to
questions.  The  European Central Bank  will next year become the
supervisor for banks in the  euro zone , under the joint oversight
deal agreed by nations and European Parliament this year. As it
prepares to take up its new duties, the central bank will
conduct asset-quality reviews to gauge the health of bank
balance sheets.  “As we see the comprehensive assessment, it would be
composed of three elements,” ECB Executive Board member Yves Mersch said yesterday. “The first would be a  risk assessment 
where we would try to define what are the portfolios that
contain the most risk and which are the portfolios that will be
screened more thoroughly during the balance sheet assessment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
