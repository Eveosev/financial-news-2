Slovenia’s  economic contraction 
eased in the second quarter as the end of the euro area’s
record-long recession boosted exports and helped offset weakness
in consumption and investment.  Gross domestic product declined 1.7 percent from a year
earlier after a 4.8 percent fall in the first three months,
extending the nation’s slump to a fifth quarter, the statistics
office, based in the capital, Ljubljana, said today on its
website. That’s less than the median estimate in a Bloomberg
 survey  of six economists, which predicted a 3.1 percent drop.  “The economy probably contracted less sharply than in the
previous quarter thanks to an improvement in net trade,” James Howat, an economist at  Capital Economics  in  London  said before
the report. “Domestic demand was probably still exceptionally
weak with the economy’s fate depending on a sustained recovery
in the euro region, which is by no means certain.”  Slovenia’s economy, which is battling a banking crisis that
pushed the nation to the brink of a bailout, will only recover
in 2015, according to the government’s economic institute. Prime
Minister Alenka Bratusek, who says no outside aid is needed, is
implementing a 1.2 billion-euro ($1.6 billion) bank rescue to
lay the grounds for recovery.  The yield on the government’s benchmark dollar bond due
2022 declined for a second session, dropping 6 basis points from
yesterday to 6.653 percent as of 9:15 a.m. in Ljubljana,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
