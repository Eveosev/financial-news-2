Taiwan’s 10-year government  bonds 
headed for the worst month since June 2007 as a strengthening
U.S. economy added to speculation the Federal Reserve will taper
asset purchases as early as September.  Fed policy makers are comfortable with cutting stimulus
that has buoyed  emerging markets  if the world’s largest economy
improves, according to minutes of their July meeting released
Aug. 21. U.S. gross domestic product expanded 2.5 percent last
quarter, exceeding an initial estimate of 1.7 percent, data
showed yesterday. Global funds sold $1.7 billion more Taiwanese
shares than they bought this month, according to exchange data.  The yield on benchmark 10-year notes rose 22 basis points
in August to 1.7260 percent as of 11:03 a.m. in Taipei, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate on government bonds due
September 2023, which will be sold at an auction on Sept. 14,
dropped one basis point today to 1.7250 percent in when-issued
trading that began yesterday. The yield on 10-year U.S.
 Treasuries (USGG10YR)  added 19 basis points in August to 2.77 percent.  “Taiwan bonds basically follow U.S. Treasuries, which have
been falling the whole month,” said Jerry Lin, a Taipei-based
fixed-income trader at First Commercial Bank. “Yields probably
won’t rise above 1.754 percent since that will start attracting
buyers. The most important thing now is the next Fed meeting.”  The Federal Open Market Committee will meet on Sept. 17.  Taiwan dollar  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.3 percent today and this
month to NT$29.923 against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex
Inc. prices show. It was trading 0.3 percent stronger 17 minutes
before the 4 p.m. close yesterday, and closed up 0.1 percent.
The central bank has sold the currency in the run-up to the
close on most days since March 2012, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent
today and 0.5 percent from a month ago to NT$29.874 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, dropped 38 basis points
in August and nine basis points today to 3.62 percent. The
 overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed this month
at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
