Tottenham will take on Russian club
Anzhi Makhachkala in the group stage of soccer’s Europa League,
while Swansea meets former champion Valencia.  The draw for the 12 four-team groups in  Europe ’s second-tier club competition was held today in  Monaco  with two-time
winner Tottenham and Anzhi placed in Group K with Sheriff
Tiraspol of Moldova and Tromso of  Norway .  Tromso was reinstated into the tournament by European
governing body UEFA before the draw, a day after being
eliminated in a playoff against Besiktas. The Turkish team was
excluded when its appeal against a match-fixing ban was rejected
by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.  Swansea and 2004 champion Valencia will play in Group A
with Kuban Krasnodar of  Russia  and Swiss club  St. Gallen . Wigan
was drawn in Group D with Russia’s  Rubin Kazan , Maribor of
Slovenia and Zulte Waregem of  Belgium .  Group-play runs from Sept. 19 to Dec. 12 with the top two
from each group advancing, where they’ll be joined by the third-place teams from the Champions League groups. The final is on
May 14 at Juventus Stadium in Turin,  Italy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
