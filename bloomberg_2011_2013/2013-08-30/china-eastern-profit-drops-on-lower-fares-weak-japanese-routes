China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670) , the
nation’s third-biggest carrier by sales, posted a 28 percent
decline in first-half profit because of discounted fares and
weak demand on flights to Japan.  Net income  dropped to 622 million yuan ($102 million) from
865.6 million yuan a year earlier, the company said in a
Shanghai stock exchange filing today, citing international
accounting standards. That compares with the 19 million-yuan
median loss estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News. Sales rose 2.7 percent.  Bigger rivals  China Southern Airlines Co. (1055)  and Air China
Ltd. have also offered discounts as they seek to fend off
competition from high-speed trains. China Eastern suffered from
weak demand on flights to Japan amid a territorial dispute
between  Asia ’s two biggest economies.  Shares of China Eastern rose 0.9 percent to close at
HK$2.37 in Hong Kong trading today, before the earnings
announcement. The stock has declined 23 percent this year.  Slowing economic growth at home and an outbreak of bird flu
also affected travel in the first half, China Eastern said.
Overall market demand may improve during the rest of the year,
the carrier said in its statement.  The airline had 37.8 million passengers during the period,
9.2 percent more from a year earlier. It filled 79.3 percent of
seats, while boosting seat capacity by 11.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
