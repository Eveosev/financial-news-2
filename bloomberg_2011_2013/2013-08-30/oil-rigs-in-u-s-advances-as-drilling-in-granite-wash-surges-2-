Rigs targeting oil in the U.S.
gained this week as producers boosted horizontal drilling for
crude in the Granite Wash play of Texas and  Oklahoma .  Oil rigs  rose by six to 1,388, data posted on  Baker Hughes
Inc. (BHI) ’s website show. Horizontal rigs targeting crude in the
Granite Wash tight-oil play jumped by nine to 64, while gas rigs
there slid by 10 to six. Total gas  rigs  in the U.S. declined by
seven to 380, a five-week low, the Houston-based field services
company said.  The  U.S. rig count  has gained by 13 this year, driven
largely by a boost in crude-drilling following a surge in  oil
prices . The additional production helped the U.S. meet 87
percent of its own energy needs in the first five months of
2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate since 1986,
according to the Energy Information Administration.  “If you’ve got oil out there, you sure want to be drilling
for it,”  James Williams , president of WTRG Economics in  London ,
 Arkansas , said by telephone. “The Granite Wash is becoming a
pretty hot spot for oil, and it’s obviously successful, because
they keep drilling.”  The gain in drilling and an increase in producers’ capital
expenditure plans are “good evidence that activity levels
onshore will continue to improve for the remainder of the
year,” James C. West, an oil-services analyst for  Barclays
Plc (BARC) ’s investment-banking unit in  New York , said in a research
note Aug. 27.  Spending Plans  Private operators who don’t publicly release their budgets
are more sensitive to short-term cash flows, and the climb in
crude prices “could entice many of them to accelerate spending
plans,” West said.  Crude for October delivery declined $1.15, or 1.1 percent,
to close at $107.65 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures settled at $110.10 on Aug. 28, a two-year
high, and are up 14 percent in the past year.  U.S. oil output gained 91,000 barrels a day to 7.61 million
in the week ended Aug. 23, the highest level since October 1989,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.
Stockpiles climbed by 2.99 million barrels to 362 million.  Natural gas for October delivery dropped 3.7 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $3.581 per million British thermal units
on the Nymex, up 30 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  rose 67 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Aug. 23 to 3.13 trillion cubic feet, the EIA said
yesterday. Supplies were 7 percent below year-earlier
inventories, the agency said.  Rigs on land  slipped by one to 1,691. Rigs in  inland waters 
also lost one to 21. The offshore rig count, primarily in the
 Gulf of Mexico , gained two to 64, the most since January 2009.  Energy rigs in  Canada  advanced by 16 to 399.  To contact the reporter on this story:
