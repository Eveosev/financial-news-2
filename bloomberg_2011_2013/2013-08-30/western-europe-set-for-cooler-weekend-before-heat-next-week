Western Europe probably will see
cooling temperatures this weekend before heat arrives next week,
AccuWeather Inc. said.  Temperatures may be about 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees
Fahrenheit) tomorrow in  London  and in Paris on Sept. 1,
AccuWeather said in a  report  on its website today. Both cities
may see warmer than normal readings of about 27 degrees Celsius
by Sept. 3.  “The warmth will not last beyond midweek as a cold front
will then usher in fresh cool air, shifting the warmth to
eastern Europe in the process,” AccuWeather said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
