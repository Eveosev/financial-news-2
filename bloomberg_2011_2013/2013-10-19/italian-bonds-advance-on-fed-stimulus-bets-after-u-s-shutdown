Italy’s 10-year government bonds
advanced for a third week amid speculation the U.S. government
shutdown this month slowed economic growth and will prompt the
Federal Reserve to maintain its asset-buying stimulus program.  The price gains pushed yields yesterday to the least in two
months. German,  French (GFRN10)  and Finnish securities also climbed as
President  Barack Obama  on Oct. 17 signed a measure ending a 16-day government closure and extending the nation’s borrowing
authority until early 2014. Ireland’s 10-year bonds climbed as
Finance Minister Michael Noonan said the nation will have exited
its bailout program by January.  “The overall risk sentiment has come back again,” said
 Michael Markovich , head of global interest-rate research at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “The markets are pricing
Italian bonds fairly in the context of the economic backdrop,
keeping in mind that they still have a decent sizable spread
relative to  Germany .”  Italy’s 10-year yield declined 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point,  this week  to 4.17 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday after reaching 4.16 percent, the  lowest  since
Aug. 13. The 4.5 percent bond due in March 2024 rose 0.945, or
9.45 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,369) face amount, to 103.145. Two-year yields fell 16 basis points to 1.43 percent.  The nation’s 10-year yield has dropped from as high as 4.66
percent on Sept. 30 as Prime Minister Enrico Letta won a
confidence vote in parliament, enabling him to continue with
structural reforms of the economy.  Budget Cuts  The Italian government will bear 2.5 billion euros of the
cuts and regional administrations will deliver 1 billion euros,
Letta said this week after his cabinet approved next year’s
budget on Oct. 15.  The extra yield that investors get for holding Italian 10-year bonds instead of bunds with a similar maturity was at 233
basis points yesterday, down from 241 basis points on Oct. 11.
The spread has been between 227 basis points and 361 basis
points this year.  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Oct. 17 that the
U.S. central bank should not begin reducing the pace of its $85
billion of monthly asset purchases as the data used to gauge the
economy’s health stopped during the government shutdown.  Ireland’s Noonan told lawmakers in Dublin on Oct. 15 the
country “will have been handed back her purse” by 2014 as he
outlined plans for a seventh austerity budget.  The Irish 10-year bond yield fell 11 basis points this week
to 3.61 percent, reaching 3.59 percent on Oct. 17, the least
since May.  Benchmark  German (GDBR10)  10-year yields dropped three basis points
to 1.83 percent. Similar-maturity French yields slid three basis
points to 2.35 percent, while  Finland ’s dropped four basis
points to 2.06 percent.  An industry report will show a  composite index  of services
and manufacturing activity in the euro area expanded at a faster
pace in October, according to the median prediction of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the Oct. 24 release.  Italian bonds returned 5.9 percent this year through Oct.
17, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s gained
9.4 percent, while Germany’s lost 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
