Treasuries gained for the first time
in three weeks as investors bet the  Federal Reserve  will delay
tapering bond purchases after Congress’s deal to end a
government shutdown pushed the budget battle into next year.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note dropped to the
lowest level in 12 weeks amid speculation the 16-day partial
federal closure curbed economic growth. Rates on bills due this
month dropped from the highest since issuance as the agreement
averted a potential default. The U.S. September payrolls report,
postponed by the shutdown, will be released Oct. 22.  “Given now the government shutdown and the lack of
reliable employment economic indicators, it will probably be the
first quarter before the Fed even starts to think about
tapering,” said Gary Pollack, who manages $12 billion as head
of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth
Management unit in  New York . “ Interest rates  can be supported
at 2.5-to-2.75 percent by the end of the year. To get below 2.5
percent, you’ll have to see some weak economic data.”  The U.S. 10-year  yield  dropped by 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, on the week to 2.58 percent in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It 2.54 percent, the
lowest level since July 24. The 2.5 percent note maturing in
August 2023 cost 99 10/32.  Yields on  30-year bonds  fell 11 basis points on the week to
3.64 percent after touching 3.62 percent, the lowest since Aug.
12.  Relative Strength  U.S. government securities reached the most expensive
levels in almost three months, based on the 10-year  term
premium , a model that includes expectations for interest rates,
growth and inflation.  The gauge fell yesterday to 0.21 percent, the lowest level
since July 22. It declined from this year’s high of 0.63 percent
set Sept. 5, signaling the cheapest levels of 2013. A positive
reading indicates investors are getting yields that are above
what is considered fair value.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 32 yesterday, down from 40 the previous
day and 67 on Oct. 15, according to Bloomberg data. A reading
lower than 30 or above 70 suggests the security may be poised
for a change in direction.  Economic Impact  “The idea that the Fed would taper right now is risky at
best,” Matthew Duch, a  fund manager  in Bethesda,  Maryland , at
Calvert Investments, which oversees more than $12 billion in
assets, said in a telephone interview Oct. 17. “If you think
negotiations are going to be easier from here, you are being
naive. And that has kept the longer end of the Treasury market
well bid.”  The standoff over U.S. fiscal policy “encouraged our
enemies” and slowed economic growth, President Obama said Oct.
17, when he signed into law the measure that ended weeks of a
wrangling. The accord sets a Dec. 13 date for completing
congressional budget talks that opened Oct. 17, funds government
operations through Jan. 15 and suspends the debt limit through
Feb. 7.  The government closing shaved at least 0.6 percent from
U.S. fourth-quarter gross-domestic-product growth,  Standard &
Poor’s  said this week in a report. The economy expanded 2.5
percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said on
Sept 26.  Rates Plunge  Lending rates dropped after the shutdown ended. The
overnight general collateral Treasury repurchase rate closed
yesterday at 0.14 percent after closing at 0.35 percent on Oct.
16, the day before the debt-ceiling deadline, according to ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker. It opened at 0.09
percent at the start of last week.  The rate on $93 billion of bills maturing on Oct. 24 was at
0.01 percent and touched zero yesterday after rising as high as
0.68 percent on Oct. 16. One-month rates were at 0.05 percent
after surging on Oct. 16 to 0.45 percent, the highest level
since October 2008. Bills due Nov. 21 dropped to negative levels
for the first time in more than two weeks.  “There were buying opportunities in the bills market,”
Paul Montaquila, fixed-income investment officer with BNP
Paribas SA’s Bank of the West, said in a telephone interview
Oct. 17. “It was a crazy ride. The bills market has returned to
normalcy. The dust has settled.”  Even with the threat of a default, rates remained lower
than historical levels, with one-month  rates  averaging 1.5
percent in the past decade and touching a high of 5.26 percent
in November 2006.  Borrowing Costs  While the jump in bill rates proved short lived, the
shutdown did cost the U.S. more to borrow.  The $35 billion in three-month bills the Treasury sold on
Oct. 15 were auctioned at a discount rate of 0.13 percent, the
highest since February 2011. That compares with 0.01 percent at
the Sept. 30 auction. The U.S. sold $30 billion six-month bills
the same day at a rate of 0.15 percent, more than double the
0.06 percent rate on the same maturity securities sold the prior
week.  At the Fed’s September meeting, days before the shutdown,
most policy makers said the central bank would probably reduce
bond purchases this year from the current pace of $85 billion a
month. They said in a statement they wanted to see more evidence
of steady growth to combat 7.3 percent unemployment.  Economists now expect the Fed to delay the first cut to its
bond-buying program until March, according to the median
estimate of 40 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. In a Sept.
18-19 survey, economists said the central bank would first
reduce the purchases in December.  Fed Views  Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans , an outspoken
advocate who has voted for Fed stimulus, said Oct. 17 the
central bank should postpone tapering after the shutdown stopped
the flow of economic reports used to gauge growth.  Even Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher , who has called
for reducing asset purchases, told reporters the same day fiscal
discord has undermined the argument for tapering.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  meets Oct. 28-29.  Fitch Ratings  on Oct. 15 put the U.S. AAA rating on watch
for a possible downgrade as the debt-ceiling deadline
approached.  Moody’s Investors Service on Oct. 17 maintained its Aaa
rating on the U.S., noting that the government’s borrowing-limit
agreement includes “credit-positive elements.” S&P downgraded
the U.S. on Aug. 5, 2011, by one notch to AA+ from AAA.  Even with this week’s rally, Treasuries have lost investors
2.15 percent this year, according to  Bloomberg US Treasury Bond
Index. (BUSY)  The Bloomberg Global Developed  Sovereign Bond Index (BGSV)  has
lost investors 2.7 percent in 2013.  The yield on the 10-year note is forecast to end the year
at 2.76 percent, according to the median forecast of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. Most respondents were surveyed as of
Oct. 10. The yield touched a 2013 high of 3.005 percent on Sept.
