Manchester United said Adnan Januzaj
signed a new five-year contract to tie the 18-year-old winger to
the English Premier League soccer club through 2018.  Januzaj scored twice in his first start in United’s 2-1 win
at Sunderland this season. The Belgian-born player’s new
contract was announced on United’s website.  He joined from Anderlecht in 2011.  “I’m delighted that Adnan has committed his future to
United,” coach  David Moyes  said in the statement. “He is an
outstanding talent and has impressed me. His balance, poise and
ability to beat players is truly exceptional for a boy of his
age.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
