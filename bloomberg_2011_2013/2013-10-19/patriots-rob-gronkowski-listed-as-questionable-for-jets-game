New England Patriots Pro Bowl tight
end  Rob Gronkowski  was listed as questionable after being
cleared by doctors to play this weekend against the  New York
Jets , the team said on its website.  The 24-year-old Gronkowski, whose status was disclosed
yesterday, has missed the past six games although he has
practiced with the team all season after having multiple
operations on his forearm and back.  A Pro Bowl selection the past two seasons, Gronkowski broke
his left forearm twice in 2012. His 1,327 yards receiving and 17
touchdown catches in 2011 were both NFL records for a tight end.  The Jets (3-3) host the Patriots (5-1) tomorrow at MetLife
Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Jets coach  Rex Ryan  told
reporters his team prepared for the game assuming Gronkowksi
would be on the field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
