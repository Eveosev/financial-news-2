U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said he is “deeply dismayed” by delays in the Maldives
presidential elections.  Hague said in an e-mailed statement today it is “vital
that the democratic process is allowed to proceed” and that a
new president is inaugurated by Nov. 11 November in line with
the Maldives constitution.  “It is clear from the extremely high turnout seen on Sept.
7 that the Maldives people are fully engaged in the process, and
their voices should be heard through the ballot box,” Hague
said. “Continuing challenges to prevent elections taking place
will be seen as nothing less than an attempt to frustrate the
democratic process. This would undermine democracy, create
greater uncertainty, further instability and damage the Maldives
economy and international reputation.”  He said the U.K. along with other Commonwealth member
states, the European Union “and the wider international
community” continue to monitor the situation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
