At least 35 people died in  India ’s
northern Uttar Pradesh state after consuming toxic illegal
alcohol,  Press Trust of India  reported.  People from eight villages of the country’s largest state
were taken ill after drinking tainted liquor, PTI reported,
citing Superintendent of Police Arvind Sen.  Drinking of alcohol made in India’s city slums and villages
and often tainted with industrial chemicals every year kills
poor people unable to afford licensed brands. About 150 people
died in West Bengal in 2011 after consuming illicit hooch, which
also claimed 180 lives in Karnataka in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
