Brazil ’s central bank will study
market demand for swap rollover auctions one day after the real
appreciated to a four-month high against the U.S. dollar.  The evaluations will begin Oct. 21 at 5:00 p.m. in order to
assess market conditions for conducting foreign exchange
“swap” auctions on October 22, 23 and 24, the bank said in a
statement posted on its website. Research is for demand for
rollover of swap contracts expiring Nov. 1.  Brazil’s currency weakened to a 4 1/2-year low in August,
prompting the central bank to start offering $3 billion in swap
and credit line auctions per week. The $60 billion program
started Aug. 23 and was scheduled to run through Dec. 31.  The real has appreciated 12.2 percent since the central
bank announced the program, the best performance against the
dollar among world currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The real
closed at 2.1523 on Oct. 17, its strongest level since June 14
before depreciating 0.8 percent today to 2.1700.  To contact the reporters on this story:
