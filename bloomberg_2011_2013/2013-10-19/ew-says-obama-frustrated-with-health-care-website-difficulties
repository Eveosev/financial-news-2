U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said “there’s no one more frustrated” than President  Barack Obama  with the difficulties on the government’s health-care
program website.  “The huge outpouring of interest shows how important it is
that we get this right,” Lew said in excerpts from an interview
with NBC’s “Meet the Press” released by the network today.
“There’s no one more frustrated than the president at the
difficulty in the website.”  Lew said he’s confident Obama’s health-care program will be
on track to ensure that people who need coverage can get it.  The “bugs” that have plagued the rollout of U.S. health-insurance exchanges will be fixed by Dec. 15, Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Max Baucus, the lead author of the 2010 law,
said on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al
Hunt ,” airing this weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
