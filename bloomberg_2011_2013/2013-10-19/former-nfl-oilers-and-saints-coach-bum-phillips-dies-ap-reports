Former National Football League
coach Oail Andrew “Bum” Phillips, who had an 82-77 record in
12 seasons leading the  Houston Oilers  and New Orleans Saints,
died last night, the Associated Press reported. He was 90.  “Bum is gone to Heaven -- loved and will be missed by all
-- great Dad, Coach and Christian,” his son, Houston Texans
defensive coordinator  Wade Phillips , said in a Twitter message.  Bum Phillips, a Texas native whose folksy sayings made him
a favorite of fans and sports writers, took the Oilers to the
playoffs in the last three of his six seasons in Houston.  Phillips, who patrolled the sidelines in cowboy boots, blue
jeans and a white Stetson hat, never had a winning record in his
five seasons with the Saints.  To contact the reporter on this story:
