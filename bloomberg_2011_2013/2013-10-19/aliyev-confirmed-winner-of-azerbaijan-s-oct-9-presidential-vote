Azerbaijan’s Constitutional Court
today declared incumbent  Ilham Aliyev  as the winner of the
Caspian Sea nation’s Oct. 9 presidential election, which
international observers said wasn’t free or fair.  Aliyev, 51, won a third term in office with 84.5 percent of
the votes, Farhad Abdullayev, the court’s chairman, said today
in Baku, the Azeri capital. The opposition candidate, Camil Hasanli, got 5.5 percent.  The 57-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe said the election fell short of international standards
and was undermined by “serious shortcomings.” The assessment
was shared by the U.S. Department of State and the EU foreign
policy chief,  Catherine Ashton .  To contact the reporter on this story:
