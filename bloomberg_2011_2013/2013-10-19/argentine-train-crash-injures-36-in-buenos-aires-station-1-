A  commuter train  crashed into a
buffer wall at the Once station in Buenos Aires this morning,
injuring 36, Security Secretary Sergio Berni said on TN
television network.  There were no fatalities. The train’s brakes failed before
entering the station, the network said, citing witnesses and
passengers. No one is seriously injured, the city’s health
minister Graciela Reybaud said on TN.  In February 2012, 52 people were killed and more than 550
injured when a train crashed into buffers after failing to stop
at the Once terminal in the Argentine capital. The crash was the
second-worst in the country’s history.  About 80 people in total were injured, Alberto Crescenti,
director of the Buenos Aires medical emergency system, known as
SAME, said on TN.  The accident occurred about 7:35 a.m. local time, Reybaud
said. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people were on the
train.  Police are questioning the driver of the train, the network
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
