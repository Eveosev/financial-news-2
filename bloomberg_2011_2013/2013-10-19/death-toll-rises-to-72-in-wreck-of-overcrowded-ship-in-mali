The death toll from a ship that
capsized last week in central  Mali  has risen to 72, after more
bodies were found when the overcrowded vessel was brought back
to the surface, according to authorities in the country.  There were too many people and too much cargo on board the
boat, Mali Security Ministry spokesman Sounkalo Togola said
today by phone. Malian officials had previously confirmed 39
dead. There were 210 people that survived the Oct. 11 accident.  The boat carrying several hundred passengers capsized while
making the 400-kilometer (250-mile) journey from Mopti to
Timbuktu in the western African country. Many on board are
thought to have been school children returning home, according
to locals.  Maliâ€™s Transport Minister Abdoulaye Koumare yesterday
pledged to put in place new safety measures to prevent future
accidents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
