The  New York  Mets are close to
moving radio coverage of its Major League Baseball games to WOR-AM, the New York Times reported, citing a person involved in the

of the New York Yankees for next season, leaving the Mets to
negotiate a multi-year agreement with WOR, the newspaper said.
The National League club’s games are also expected to appear on
five FM stations, the Times said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
