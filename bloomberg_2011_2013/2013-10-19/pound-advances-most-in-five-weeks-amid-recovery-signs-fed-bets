The pound rose the most in five
weeks versus the dollar as investors bet the U.S. debt-ceiling
debate will prompt the Federal Reserve to maintain asset
purchases that tend to weaken a currency.  Sterling strengthened for the first time in three weeks
against the euro as data showed U.K. retail sales increased more
than analysts forecast last month and jobless claims fell in
September by the most in 16 years, signaling the U.K. economy is
gaining momentum. U.S. President  Barack Obama  signed into law a
measure ending the 16-day government shutdown and extending the
nation’s borrowing authority until early next year, averting a
default. U.K. government bonds advanced for a second week.  “Sterling outperformance this week was more a case of
dollar weakness rather than sterling strength as speculation the
Federal Reserve will delay tapering weighs on the U.S.
currency,” said Peter Kinsella, senior currency strategist at
Commerzbank AG in London. “That said, the U.K. data picture is
still pretty constructive, so further upside towards $1.64
should not be discounted.”  The pound rose 1.45 percent in the week to $1.6188 as of
4:53 p.m. London time yesterday, the biggest gain since the
five-day period ended Sept. 13. It rose as high as $1.6225
yesterday, the most since Oct. 3. Sterling gained 0.4 percent in
the week to 84.60 pence per euro.  The pound appreciated 5.1 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro strengthened
4 percent, while the dollar weakened 1.4 percent.  Retail Sales  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Oct. 17 the
U.S. central bank shouldn’t begin reducing the pace of its $85
billion of monthly asset purchases as the data used to gauge the
economy’s health stopped during the government shutdown.  An Oct. 17 report showed U.K. retail sales including fuel
increased 0.6 percent from August, when they declined 0.8
percent. The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 0.4 percent gain. Claims for U.K. unemployment
benefit fell 41,700, the most since June 1997, the Office for
National Statistics said Oct. 16. The decline exceeded the
25,000 drop forecast by analysts.  Benchmark  10-year gilt yields  fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.71 percent. The 2.25 percent bond
maturing September 2023 rose 0.205, or 2.05 pounds per 1,000-pounds face amount, to 96.01.  A report next week will show the U.K. economy grew 0.8
percent in the third quarter from 0.7 percent previously,
according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey. The Bank of England is scheduled on Oct. 23 to publish
minutes from this month’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting. The
Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell bonds maturing in
2068 via banks next week.  U.K. government bonds lost 3.2 percent this year through
Oct. 17, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries
