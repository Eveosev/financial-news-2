Carlsberg A/S (CARLB) , the world’s fourth-
biggest brewer, said it will be the exclusive beer partner of
the Chinese Super League, a soccer tournament, from next year
through 2016.  Carlsberg’s  China  unit has teamed with IMG Worldwide, a
sports, fashion and media business, the Copenhagen-based company
said today in a statement, and will promote the Chinese Super
League in its marketing in the country. It didn’t disclose the
terms of the deal. Carlsberg also sponsored soccer’s European
Championships last year.  “Carlsberg has a long history sponsoring sporting events,
especially football,” Stephen Maher, head of Carlsberg’s China
unit, said in the statement. “This new partnership will
leverage the two partners’ experience and resources and improve
the quality of the league.”  Brewers including Carlsberg are seeking ways to boost sales
in emerging economies including China, the world’s biggest beer
market, as volume wanes in  Europe  and the U.S. Carlsberg
competes in China with Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, the owner of
Budweiser, and SABMiller Plc, which sells the world’s biggest
brand by volume, Snow.  “The CSL needs the support of its commercial partners to
take the league to a new level,” Zhu Qilin, general manager of
CSL Co., commented in the statement. “This new partnership will
see Carlsberg bring to the CSL its rich experience in working
with other football leagues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
