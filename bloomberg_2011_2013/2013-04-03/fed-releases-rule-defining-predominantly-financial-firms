The Federal Reserve approved a final
rule that defines whether a company is “predominantly engaged
in financial activities.”  “The requirements will be used by the Financial Stability
Oversight Council when it considers the potential designation of
a nonbank financial company for consolidated supervision by the
Federal Reserve,”  the Fed  said today in a statement today in
Washington. The rule says companies are “predominantly”
engaged in financial activities if 85 percent or more of the
firm’s revenues or assets are financial in nature.  The Fed was required to write the rule by the Dodd-Frank
financial regulatory overhaul that was signed into law in July
2010. Regulators will use the designation in determining whether
a company may be subject to additional regulatory oversight.  The Fed first proposed the rule in February 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
