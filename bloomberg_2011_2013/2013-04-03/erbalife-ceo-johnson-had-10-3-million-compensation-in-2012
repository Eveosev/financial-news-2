Herbalife Ltd. (HLF)  said Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Michael Johnson  was paid compensation of
$10.3 million in 2012, a drop from the previous year when his
pay was inflated by the value of stock awards.  Johnson was paid a salary of $1.24 million, an increase of
0.5 percent from 2011, and received options valued at $5 million
and incentive compensation of $3.71 million, the Cayman Islands-
based nutrition company said in a proxy filing today. Johnson
achieved the maximum award for compensation linked to earnings
per share and sales volume in the year, according to the filing.  “Numbers speak for themselves,” Michael Swartz, an
analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. in Atlanta, said
today in an e-mail. “They blew away their EPS, volume points
and operating income targets for the year and were compensated
accordingly,” said Swartz, who has a buy rating on the stock.  The company also reiterated that Jonathan Christodoro and
Keith Cozza, two associates of billionaire  Carl Icahn , are
nominated for election to its board at its annual shareholder
meeting on April 25. Icahn had a stake of 15.6 percent as of
March 6, according to the filing, and has said he will seek
talks with the company about strategic alternatives, including
taking it private.  His stake pits him against rival hedge fund manager  Bill Ackman , who has sold short 20 million shares of the company and
argued that its multi-level marketing structure is a pyramid
scheme that regulators should shut down.  Herbalife’s 2012 earnings per share increased by 121
percent to $4.05 a share, while its so-called volume point
growth, a measure of sales performance, increased 222 percent.
Both measures exceeded targets set by the company.  In 2011, Johnson’s total compensation was $24.6 million,
boosted by an additional stock award valued at $15 million that
will take three years to vest provided certain targets are met.  Herbalife rose 2.6 percent to $39.01 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  have risen 18 percent this year, compared with
an 8.9 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
