German stocks  retreated, after
rallying the most in four weeks yesterday, as reports on service
industries and hiring by companies in the U.S. trailed
economists’ estimates.  Kloeckner & Co. retreated 4.2 percent as a gauge of
commodity stocks posted the biggest drop among the 19 industry
groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   United Internet AG (UTDI)  dropped
0.9 percent after UBS AG downgraded the shares.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  lost 0.9 percent to 7,874.75 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt, its biggest drop in a week. The equity
benchmark has still gained 3.5 percent this year amid
speculation that central banks will maintain their stimulus
measures. The broader HDAX Index slipped 0.8 percent today.  “We are seeing consolidation today,” Soeren Steinert, who
helps manage about $24 billion as associate director for

compiled by Bloomberg showed.  In the U.S., companies hired 158,000 workers in March,
figures from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research

for about 90 percent of the U.S. economy, grew at a slower pace
in March than economists had forecast. The Institute for Supply
Management’s non-manufacturing index slipped to 54.4 from 56 in
February, falling short of the  median economist  estimate of
55.5. Readings above 50 mean that activity increased.  Kloeckner, Europe’s largest independent steel trader,
declined 4.2 percent to 10.36 euros.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , Germany’s biggest steelmaker, fell 4
percent to 15 euros.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the third-biggest maker of luxury cars, slid
1.2 percent to 42.63 euros. Rival Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s
BMW reported a 13 percent U.S. sales increase in March, cutting
into the luxury-auto lead of Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz.  United Internet dropped 0.9 percent to 19.25 euros after
