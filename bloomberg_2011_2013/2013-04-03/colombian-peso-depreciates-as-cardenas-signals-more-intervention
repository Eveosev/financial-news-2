Colombia ’s peso fell for the first
time in four days as Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said the
government is considering additional measures to stem gains in
the currency.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 1,819.79 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:49 a.m. in Bogota. The currency has appreciated 24 percent
since the beginning of 2009.  Cardenas said today in Bogota that the peso’s rally is the
“mother of all the problems,” making agricultural and
industrial exports less competitive. The government is working
on a plan to help revive growth that includes currency
intervention and excludes  capital controls  because they “are
not effective,” he said yesterday.  “Cardenas has the market pretty scared, although frankly
it’s not clear what other currency measures they can take,”
said  Camilo Perez , the head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the
nation’s second-biggest bank.  The central bank said Jan. 28 that it will buy at least $30
million a day, bringing purchases in the foreign-exchange market
to $3 billion between February and May. Cardenas has also said
that the government will buy $1 billion to pay for interest and
principal on foreign bonds coming due this year in addition to
the $1 billion it will purchase for its oil-stability fund.  Yields on peso bonds maturing in 2024 climbed six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.09 percent, according to
the central bank. The price fell 0.649 centavos to 141.383
centavos per peso.  The yields have risen 19 basis points this week as
investors pared bets the central bank will cut the benchmark
overnight lending rate further after an unexpected 50 basis
point cut on March 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
