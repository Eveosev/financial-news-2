Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
President  Charles Evans  said the central bank has not yet
reached the point when it should wind down its record stimulus.  “There’s still work to do,” Evans said today in a speech
in Richmond, Virginia. “The committee currently thinks that at
the end of 2014 we’re still going to be below the inflation
objective and unemployment is still going to be above 5.5
percent” he said, referring to the central bank’s dual mandate
for stable prices and maximum employment.  “In about two years, we are still going to be missing,”
Evans said during a debate with Richmond Fed President  Jeffrey Lacker  at Virginia Commonwealth University.  Evans this year holds a vote on the policy-setting  Federal
Open Market Committee  while Lacker does not.  To contact the reporters on this story:
