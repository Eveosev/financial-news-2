Former England striker Emile Heskey
agreed to play another season with the Newcastle Jets A-League
team, joining Alessandro Del Piero and Shinji Ono in extending
their stay in  Australia ’s elite soccer competition.  “Everything is agreed and I will be coming back next
season,” Heskey said on the Jets’ website.  Heskey, 35, made the three-man shortlist for Newcastle’s
2012-13 Player of the Year Award after scoring nine goals in 23
games during his first season with the club. He follows World
Cup-winning Italian forward Del Piero and Japanese playmaker Ono
in re-signing with their teams after the trio were acquired as
so-called marquee players last year.  Ono’s Western Sydney Wanderers topped the  regular-season
standings  in their inaugural campaign, while the Jets and Del
Piero’s Sydney FC missed out on the six-team finals series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
