Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  advanced for the second day as investors expected
seasonal demand to increase in spring.  The contract for delivery in October advanced as much as 1
percent to 3,807  yuan  ($614) a metric ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange, before trading at 3,793 at 10:15 a.m. local
time. Futures gained 1.2 percent yesterday after falling on
April 1 to the lowest closing price since Dec. 13.  Demand may rise as spring is typically the peak consumption
season for building projects and this year some of the
construction projects were delayed by cold weather, Ren Xinlei,
analyst at Luzheng Securities Co., said by phone from Qingdao
today.  “The bulls’ camp can point to the peak season ahead for
de-stocking to take place soon,” Ren said. “There are some
bullish investors adding to their positions today.”  The average spot  price  of rebar fell 0.2 percent to 3,630
yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port dropped 0.9
percent yesterday to $136.10 a dry ton, according to The Steel
Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
