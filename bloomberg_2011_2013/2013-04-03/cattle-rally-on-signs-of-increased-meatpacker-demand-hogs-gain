Cattle futures climbed for the first
time in three days on signs of increasing demand from U.S. meat
processors. Hog prices also rose.  Meatpackers processed 229,000 head of cattle in the first
two days of the week, up 0.9 percent from the same period a week
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Spot  steers 
averaged $1.25 a pound, up 2.4 percent from the same period a
year earlier, according to the USDA.  “Packers are needing some cattle,” Lane Broadbent, a vice
president at KIS Futures Inc. in Oklahoma City, said in a
telephone interview. The number of animals being offered for
slaughter “is still tight enough that they’re having to hustle
to get cattle for their kill needs.”  Cattle futures for June delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
$1.237 a pound at 12:33 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
headed for the first gain since March 28.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement added 0.1 percent
to $1.4725 a pound. Prices are down 4.7 percent this year
through yesterday.  Hog futures for June settlement rose 0.6 percent to 92.375
cents a pound on the CME. Through yesterday, prices were up 7.1
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
