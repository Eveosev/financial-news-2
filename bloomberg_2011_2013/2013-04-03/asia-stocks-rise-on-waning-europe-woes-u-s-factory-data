Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark climbing for the first time in three days, as Japan’s
central bank began a two-day policy meeting and better-than-
estimated U.S. factory orders buoyed exporters.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets 44 percent of its revenue in
 North America , gained 4.6 percent in Tokyo as rising demand for
motor vehicles boosted U.S. factory orders. Fast Retailing Co.

an extra Sunday in March fueled the biggest monthly sales jump
in more than three years at Asia’s largest apparel retailer.
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia  fell 0.7 percent as a report
showed new home sales in the country retreated.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5 percent to 134.52 as
of 7:05 p.m in Hong Kong, having swung between gains and losses
at least four times. The gauge climbed the past five months as
Japanese shares increased on speculation the nation will deploy
more stimulus and amid signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering.  “You still have ongoing support from the  Federal Reserve 
and the  Bank of Japan (8301) ,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
$126 billion under management. “It’s probably more of a buying
opportunity for equities and I’d caution about getting too
bearish.”  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 3 percent, the
most in two months, as the first policy meeting began under the
leadership of Haruhiko Kuroda as governor. Kuroda, who
reiterated yesterday that bold action is necessary to meet

 government bonds  will be the main tool for monetary easing.  Regional Gauges  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  slid 0.6 percent and South

Index was little changed. Singapore’s Straits Times Index added
0.1 percent, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.1 percent and

factories rose the most in five months in February, boosted by a
pickup in demand for motor vehicles and commercial aircraft, a
Commerce Department report showed yesterday. Honda climbed 4.6
percent to 3,525 yen. Toyota Motor Corp. advanced 3.8 percent to
4,790.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , the benchmark regional
equities gauge, yesterday traded at 13.3 times average estimated
earnings compared with 14.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.7 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.2 percent. The measure

label about 30 years ago.  Private home sales in Australia declined 5.3 percent in
