Romania’s economy averted a
recession in the fourth quarter, growing more than initially
announced as a decline in industrial output eased.  Gross domestic product  rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4
percent from the previous three months, more than the 0.1
percent announced in a March 6 preliminary report, after a
revised 0.2 percent decline in the third quarter, the  National
Statistics Institute  in Bucharest said today in an e-mail. GDP
advanced an adjusted 0.7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011
and an unadjusted 1.1 percent, compared with a previously
announced unadjusted figure of 0.3 percent.  Romania’s economy is recovering from a two-year recession
that ended in 2010. The rebound was limited last year by a poor
harvest and slowing export growth amid Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis. GDP grew 2.2 percent in 2011.  “The revisions of the GDP growth figures come mainly from
the significant improvement of the industry and trade
contributions,” the statistics office said in the statement.  The drop in industrial production was revised from 0.6
percent to 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the
previous three months. That narrowed the year-on-year decline to
0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 2.4 percent.  Agriculture declined 24.6 percent in the fourth quarter
from the same period a year earlier, while construction output
shrank 1.7 percent.  Final consumption rose 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier, after contracting 0.4 percent in the
previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
