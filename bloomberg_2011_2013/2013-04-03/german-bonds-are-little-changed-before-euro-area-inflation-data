Spanish bonds rose, with 10-year
securities gaining for a third day, on bets the European Central
Bank will signal tomorrow it intends to keep interest rates at a
record low, underpinning demand for higher-yielding assets.  Italian bonds also gained as the International Monetary
Fund said it had agreed to contribute about 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) as part of a rescue program for Cyprus. Spain’s
two-year yields fell to the lowest in three weeks before the
country sells debt maturing from 2016 to 2021 tomorrow. German
 two-year yields  were below zero for a sixth day. Portuguese
bonds advanced as Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said the
country’s bailout program will end next year.  “Everybody is looking for something that is yielding
more” than German notes, said Piet Lammens, head of research at
KBC Bank NV in Brussels. “A number of the underlying problems
have at least been partially resolved. All this gives the market
more resilience.”  Spain’s 10-year yield dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.91 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
declining 14 basis points during the previous two days. The 5.4
percent bond due in January 2023 rose 0.235, or 2.35 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 103.715.  The two-year yield fell five basis points to 2.20 percent
after reaching 2.15 percent, the lowest since March 11.  The ECB’s Governing Council will keep its main refinancing
rate at a record low of 0.75 percent tomorrow, according to 54
of 56 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The other two predict a
cut to 0.5 percent. President Mario Draghi pledged in July to do
“whatever it takes” to defend the single currency.  ‘Great Efforts’  IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde announced the
staff-level agreement with Cyprus today on the 10 billion-euro
program agreed on March 25. The deal calls for the nation to
restructure its two largest banks, reduce budget deficits and
adjust its wage and pension systems.  “We believe that it provides a durable and fully financed
solution to the underlying problems facing Cyprus,” Lagarde
said in a statement.  The Cyprus Central Bank will issue a decree extending
capital controls aimed at preventing a flight of funds out of
the country by seven days, said Yiangos Dimitriou, a central
bank official.  Italy’s  10-year yield  declined three basis points to 4.59
percent after dropping 14 basis points yesterday.  German Bunds  German bunds were supported on speculation some investors
preferred to seek safety before the ECB meeting.  “We see bund yields staying pretty low before tomorrow’s
ECB rate decision,” said Ralf Umlauf, an analyst at Landesbank
Hessen-Thueringen in Frankfurt. “The market is waiting to see
what happens and no one wants to be short.” A short position is
a bet an asset will decline.  German 10-year yields fell two basis points to 1.29 percent
and two-year rates were little changed at minus 0.001 percent.  Germany allotted 3.29 billion euros of five-year notes
today at an average yield of 0.33 percent, down from 0.45
percent at the previous auction on March 6.  Portugal’s bonds gained as Coelho said in parliament that
the country’s bailout program will end in May 2014. The nation’s
10-year yield fell 10 basis points to 6.33 percent, while two-
year yields dropped 14 basis points to 2.93 percent.  Volatility on French bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of the Netherlands and Finland,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German bunds returned 0.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
bonds gained 3.6 percent and Italy’s rose 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
