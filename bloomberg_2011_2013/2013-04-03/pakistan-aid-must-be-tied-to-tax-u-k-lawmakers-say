U.K. development aid for  Pakistan 
should be conditional on greater efforts by the South Asian
nation’s government to tax its wealthy elite, lawmakers said.  The  International Development Committee  of the House of
Commons also called today for any increase in U.K. assistance to
be more closely tied to efforts to promote the rule of law and
fight corruption. The U.K. will give Pakistan 376 million pounds
($569 million) in aid this year.  “The committee is concerned that not enough tax is raised
in Pakistan to fully finance improvements in the quality of life
for poor people,” the cross-party panel’s chairman, Liberal
Democrat lawmaker Malcolm Bruce, said in a statement. “We
cannot expect people in the U.K. to pay taxes to improve
education and health in Pakistan if the Pakistani elite does not
pay meaningful amounts of income tax.”  Pakistan was among the  15 lowest revenue-gathering nations 
in the world as a percentage of gross domestic product,
according to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency’s 2012 World
Factbook. The country recorded the highest  budget deficit  in two
decades in the fiscal year through June as it missed its tax
target.  About 856,000 of the country’s 183 million people pay tax,
according to the Federal Board of Revenue. Each taxpayer
contributes on average 13,673 rupees ($139).  In December, the government approved a plan to offer 3
million of Pakistan’s richest tax evaders a chance to pay a one-
time 40,000-rupee penalty on undeclared income and assets of as
much as 5 million rupees, in an effort to widen the tax net.  To contact the reporter on this story:
