Free-agent cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha reached a one-year agreement with the San Francisco
49ers, the Associated Press said, citing the player’s agent Ben Dogra.  Asomugha’s contract could pay him as much as $3 million, AP
said. The deal, which may be signed today, calls for a base
salary of $1.35 million and incentives of $1.65 million.  Dogra was cited as saying that Asomugha, who was released
by the Philadelphia Eagles on March 12, joined San Francisco
because the team has “a great chance to win a Super Bowl and he
wants to be part of it.”  The 31-year-old three-time Pro Bowl selection spent his
first eight National Football League seasons, from 2003-2010,
with the Oakland Raiders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
