Mark Cutifani , who today replaced
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  head  Cynthia Carroll , will assess the
company’s assets and commodities within the next four months to
ensure it’s squeezing the most value from its businesses.  “I’ll look at the portfolio, the commodities we’re in,”
Cutifani said in an interview broadcast on the company’s
website. “Are they the right commodities for the future?”  Cutifani, 54, was named as chief executive officer three
months ago. Carroll quit in October after Anglo lost about $14
billion in value during her tenure and suffered cost blowouts
and delays at an $8.8 billion iron-ore project in Brazil. The
company also mines coal, copper, precious metals and diamonds.  “The assets: are they competitive?,” Cutifani said today.
“Are they as good as they could be? Should we be doing things
differently to realize value?”  The new CEO also plans to assess the balance sheet after
London-based Anglo swung to a loss last year amid asset
writedowns, strikes in  South Africa  and lower commodity prices.
While there’s “always some uncertainty” in  commodities
markets , global growth will bolster demand, he said.  “In terms of water, energy, commodities, the world is
short,” according to Cutifani. “If the world is going to
continue to grow at better than 3 percent, we don’t have enough
of any of those products to actually support that growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
