The Philippine peso fell for a third
day on speculation the central bank will again cut the  interest
rate  on its special-deposit accounts to help curb capital
inflows.  “If there is room to reduce the rate further, then we will
do that,” Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tentangco
said yesterday in an interview in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.
The monetary authority has cut the rate twice this year to 2.5
percent, while holding its benchmark interest rate at a record-
low 3.5 percent to damp gains in the peso.  The Philippine currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 40.905
per dollar as of 4:21 p.m. in  Manila , Tullett Prebon Plc prices
showed. It touched 40.960 earlier, the weakest level since March
27. The currency has risen 4.4 percent against the dollar in the
past 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,  “A further rate cut would reduce the attractiveness of the
peso,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a currency strategist at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur , referring to the
special-deposit accounts. “We expect the Philippine peso to
weaken to 42 against the dollar in the near term.”  One-month implied volatility in the peso, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.84 percent.  The yield on the government’s 6.125 percent bonds due 2037
climbed eight basis points to 3.79 percent, according to
Tradition Financial Services.  The Philippine  budget deficit  narrowed to 11.75 billion
pesos ($287 million) in February from 19.5 billion pesos in the
previous month, according to an e-mailed statement from the
finance department today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
