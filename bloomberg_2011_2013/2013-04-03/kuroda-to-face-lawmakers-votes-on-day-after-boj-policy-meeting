Japanese lawmakers will vote on
Haruhiko Kuroda’s selection as central bank governor for a
second time on April 5, a day after his first policy board
meeting ends.  Kuroda will attend the lower chamber of the Diet, which is
dominated by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal  Democratic
Party , the chamber’s steering committee chairman Genichiro Sata
told reporters today.  The upper house will also vote that day, according to an
official in the ruling coalition and an opposition Democratic
Party of Japan lawmaker, both of whom asked not to be named
because the scheduling has not been made public.  Mitsuru Sakurai, policy chief of the DPJ, the largest group
in the upper house, has said he wants to observe the results of
this week’s policy board meeting before deciding whether the
party will support Kuroda staying in the role.  Kuroda was confirmed by both houses of parliament last
month to serve the final weeks of his predecessor’s term, and a
second approval is needed for a full five-year period. His first
policy board meeting starts today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
