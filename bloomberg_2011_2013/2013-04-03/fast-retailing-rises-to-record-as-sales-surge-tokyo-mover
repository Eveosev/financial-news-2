Fast Retailing Co. (9983) ,  Asia ’s largest
apparel retailer, rose to a record in Tokyo trading after saying
warmer weather and an extra Sunday in March fueled the biggest
monthly sales jump in more than three years.  The maker of Uniqlo brand casual clothes rose 6.7 percent
to 33,400 yen as of 9:11 a.m. in Tokyo trading, headed for the
highest close on record, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales at stores open at least a year in  Japan  climbed 23
percent last month from a year earlier as warmer-than-average
weather boosted demand for spring clothing and the month
included one more Sunday than in 2012, the company said
yesterday in a statement after market hours.  “This is an impressive showing, even taking into account
the run of warm weather, and the calendar effect,” Hidehiko Aoki, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote today
in a note to clients. The additional Sunday added about 3
percentage points to sales growth, said Aoki, who raised his
price objective for the shares to 34,400 yen and maintained a
buy rating.  The sales increase was the biggest since October 2009,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
