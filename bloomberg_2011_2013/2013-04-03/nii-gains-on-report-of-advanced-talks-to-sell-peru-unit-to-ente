NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , which sells
Nextel mobile-phone service in  Latin America , gained the most in
more than four years on a report that it’s in advanced talks to
sell its Peru unit to Chile’s Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones SA.  Entel (ENTEL) , as the Chilean phone company is known, would pay
$500 million for the business, Peru’s El Comercio  reported  late
yesterday, citing unnamed sources close to the transaction.
Claudia Restrepo, an NII spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return
phone and e-mail messages today from Bloomberg News. An Entel
press official declined to comment.  NII is considering selling businesses in Peru, Chile and
Argentina, as well as assets such as its wireless towers, to
focus on growth in Mexico and Brazil. Peruvian service revenue
fell 2.3 percent last year to $289.8 million as competition
pushed customers’ monthly bills lower.  “We have roughly estimated gross proceeds of approximately
$1 billion for all three markets that are being evaluated for
sale,” said  Chris King , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in
Baltimore, in a research note today. NII lost about $14 million
in Peru last year, he said. He advises buying the shares.  NII, based in Reston, Virginia,  surged  21 percent to $5.05
at the close in New York, the biggest gain since November 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
