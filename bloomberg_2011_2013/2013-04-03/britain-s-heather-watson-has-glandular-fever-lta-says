Heather Watson , Britain’s highest-
ranked female tennis player, is recovering from glandular fever,
the Lawn Tennis Association said.  “Blood tests in Miami revealed traces of the virus and
doctors have indicated that Heather is at the tail-end of the
fever, although there’s no news yet of how long a full recovery
might take,” the  LTA  said in a statement on its website today.  Glandular fever mostly affects young adults, according to
the website of the  National Health Service . It can cause
fatigue, a high temperature and a sore throat.  “I have been struggling with both training and playing
matches and felt so tired and exhausted for months but now that
the doctors have found the cause of this, it explains everything
that has been happening to me physically and mentally,” Watson
said. “I am actually relieved to know what is wrong so that I
can get myself on the mend.”  Watson, who is ranked 40th on the women’s WTA tour, was
knocked out of the opening round of tournaments in Miami and
 Indian Wells , California, last month. The 20-year-old, who moved
to  Florida  to train at the Bollettieri Academy when she was 12
years old, became the first British woman to win a tour title
since 1988 when she captured the Japan Open in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
