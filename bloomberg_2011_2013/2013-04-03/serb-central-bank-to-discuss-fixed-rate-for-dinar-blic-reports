Serbian central bank Governor
Jorgovanka Tabakovic will hold closed-door discussions with
businessmen and bankers on whether a fixed exchange rate for the
dinar is better than a managed float, Blic newspaper reported
without saying where it got the information.  Nebojsa Savic, the chairman of the Governor’s Council,
opposes the idea and said the central bank needs to continue to
fight “indecently high inflation,” according to Blic.  Tabakovic promised a public discussion on an exchange rate
system during the March 12-15 Kopaonik Business Forum. The
central bank’s press office could not confirm the plan, when
contacted by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
