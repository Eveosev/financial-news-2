Elektroprivreda Srbije JP, Serbia’s
dominant power company, said its unconsolidated net loss fell 50
percent to 2.4 billion dinars ($27.5 million) in 2012 because of
cost cuts.  The result at the Belgrade-based parent company, excluding
its power-generating and distribution units and coal mines,
dropped from 4.8 billion dinars a year earlier, according to a
statement published on its  website .  The state-owned utility expects a consolidated loss of
about 33 billion dinars for 2012, acting Chief Executive Officer
Aleksandar Obradovic said Feb. 7. The company, known as EPS, had
a consolidated net income of 26.8 billion dinars in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story: Misha Savic in Belgrade
