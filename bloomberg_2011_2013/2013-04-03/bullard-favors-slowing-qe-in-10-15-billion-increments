President James Bullard said he favors reducing the central
bank’s monthly asset purchases by $10 billion to $15 billion
increments in response to changes in the economy.  “I would be very comfortable moving in small amounts --
$10 or $15 billion at a time,” Bullard said on Bloomberg
Radio’s “Hays Advantage” with Kathleen Hays. “We are getting
much closer.”  The Federal Open Market Committee seems to be coming around
to the view of adjusting purchases, so-called quantitative
easing, in response to fluctuations in data, Bullard said. The
St. Louis Fed chief, who votes on monetary policy this year, was
one of the first Fed official to urge slowing the pace of bond
purchases in 2013 in response to economic reports, a position
echoed by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke last month.  Bullard said Fed policy is appropriate for now, adding “I
don’t think we have to be in any hurry” to curb purchases with
inflation low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
