India’s rupee fell toward a two-week
low after the nation’s current-account deficit rose to a record
in the fourth quarter.  The  shortfall  in the broadest measure of trade was $32.6
billion in the three months through December as imports of oil
and gold surged, while export growth slowed, official data
showed March 28. The government estimated Feb. 28 that Asia’s
third-largest economy will need more than $75 billion of inflows
in the year through March 2014 to fund the current-account gap.  The rupee fell 0.2 percent to 54.3600 per dollar as of 9:45
a.m. in Mumbai, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It touched
54.445 earlier, near the 54.565 level reached on March 20.  “A record current-account deficit continues to weigh on
the Indian currency,” analysts at Edelweiss Financial Advisors
Ltd., including Mumbai-based Vinay Khattar, wrote in a report
today. Technical charts indicate the currency needs to move out
of the 54 to 55 per dollar range to signal future direction,
they wrote.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, was
unchanged at 8.02 percent.  India removed all restrictions and sub-limits governing
foreign funds’ purchases of rupee debt effective April 1, while
keeping the overall cap at $25 billion for sovereign notes and
$51 billion for securities issued by companies.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.44 per
dollar, compared with 55.35 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.37 versus 55.28. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
