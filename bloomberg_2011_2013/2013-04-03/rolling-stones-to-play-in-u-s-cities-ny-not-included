The  Rolling Stones  announced plans for a nine-city Northern American tour today.  The veteran band also confirmed it will headline the U.K.’s Glastonbury Festival on June 29 and perform in  London ’s Hyde Park on July 6.  The tour, called “50 and Counting,” starts at the Staples Center in  Los Angeles  in May. There will also be shows in Oakland and San Jose in California; Las Vegas; Anaheim, California; Toronto,  Chicago ,  Boston  and Philadelphia.  Last year, the Stones marked their 50th anniversary, having first played at the Marquee Club in London in 1962. They played dates at the O2 London, Brooklyn’s Barclays Center,  New York , and the Prudential Center Newark.  New York isn’t included in the new round of shows just announced in an e-mailed statement from the band.  The last major tour by Mick Jagger’s men was A Bigger Bang, which had takings of $558 million -- beaten only by the $736 million generated during the U2 360 shows.
