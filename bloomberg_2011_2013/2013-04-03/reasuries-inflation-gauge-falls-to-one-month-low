Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
yields to the lowest level in three months, as worse-than-
forecast data on U.S. employment and the services industry
spurred concern economic growth may be slowing.  U.S. government debt  erased an earlier decline as companies
added 158,000 workers last month, figures from the Roseland, New
Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed, below the median
estimate of a 200,000 gain in a Bloomberg survey. A Labor
Department report on April 5 is forecast to show the
 unemployment rate  remained at a four-year low of 7.7 percent. An
inflation-expectations  gauge  preferred by the  Federal Reserve 
was below average.  “There were some shorts in the market, people expecting a
higher number” from ADP, said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury
trader in  New York  at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc.
“People are nervous about Friday.” A short position is a bet
an asset will decline in value.  The benchmark 10-year  note  yield fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.81 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 1.79
percent, the lowest since Jan. 2. The 2 percent note due in
February 2023 rose 14/32, or $4.38 per $1,000 face amount, to
101 22/32.  The  30-year bond  yield fell five basis points to 3.05
percent as the price rose 31/32, or $9.69 per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 15/32.  ‘Springtime Swoon’  Treasuries extended gains today as the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  index  of U.S. non-manufacturing businesses, which
covers almost 90 percent of the economy, fell to 54.4 in March
from 56 in the prior month, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said
today. The median forecast of 73 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 55.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  “People are starting to worry about the traditional
springtime swoon in the economy,” said Mitsubishi UFJ’s Roth.  Benchmark yields  have fallen from their yearly highs in
each of the prior three springs. Last year, yields reached 2.38
percent in March before dropping in April after a weaker-than-
forecast jobs report.  In 2011, yields declined from a February high of 3.74
percent amid weakening economic data and then plunged below 2
percent following the  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S.
credit rating in August. In 2010, yields reached 3.99 percent in
April before tumbling as the European sovereign-debt crisis
spread.  Jobs Reports  The ADP employment increase, held back by limited hiring in
construction, was the smallest since October and followed a
revised 237,000 gain the prior month. Estimates in the Bloomberg
survey ranged from gains of 170,000 to 240,000.  “The market is now fully focused on Friday to define
direction,” said  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S. economist at Royal
Bank of Canada’s RBC  Capital Markets  LLC, one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “The real question is, when do
you start to gain momentum? No one can deny it’s moving along.”  Payrolls may have risen 205,000 in March, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, after a 236,000 gain the
previous month that drove Treasury yields to an 11-month high on
March 8 when the Labor Department released the report.  The Fed has said it would keep its key interest-rate target
between zero to 0.25 percent as long as unemployment remains
above 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation is projected at
no more than 2.5 percent.  ‘Full Steam’  Fed Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said the
central bank is in no hurry to reduce its record bond buying
with inflation running below its 2 percent target.  “It is full steam ahead right now,” Bullard said today on
 Bloomberg Radio ’s “Hays Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays . “That
is exactly what the committee is doing.”  A voter on monetary policy this year, Bullard was one of
the first Federal Open Market Committee officials to urge
slowing the pace of bond purchases in 2013 if warranted by
economic reports, a position taken by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
last month. In 2010, Bullard initiated calls for a second round
of bond buying, which ran from November 2010 until June 2011.  The U.S. central bank purchased $3.728 billion of
Treasuries maturing from February 2019 to March 2020 today as
part of its program to buy $85 billion in  government securities 
each month to boost the economy. Investors had offered to sell
$13.957 billion of securities to the central bank.  Bond ‘Bubble’  Treasuries held on the Fed’s balance sheet totaled a record
$1.79 trillion at the end of March, while its  mortgage  holdings
have risen to $1.08 trillion, up 28 percent since policy makers
announced in September 2012 that they would begin purchasing $40
billion a month of the securities.  The central bank’s asset purchases, which also include $45
billion a month in Treasuries, have led to “a bubble in the
 bond market ,” said  John Ryding , chief economist and co-founder
of RDQ Economics, in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In
the Loop.”  “There’s no reason fundamentally yields should be this
low,” Ryding said. “The Fed’s repressing those yields and that
will ultimately cause distortions in the capital markets and in
the economy.”  Yields show inflation expectations have yet to rise. The
Fed’s measure of traders’ forecasts for costs in the economy for
the period from 2018 to 2023, known as the five-year five-year
forward  break-even rate , was 2.7 percent as of March 28, below
the average for the past decade of 2.8 percent.  The yield on the 10-year note will end the year at 2.25
percent, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
