European stocks  declined the most in
five weeks, paring yesterday’s biggest rally for the region’s
 benchmark index  in almost a month, as U.S. manufacturing
activity fell faster than estimated, and companies in the
world’s largest economy added fewer workers than forecast.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  retreated 3.1 percent after Verizon
Communications Inc. denied it’s considering a bid for the U.K.
company. Kazakhmys Plc fell to its lowest price in four years as
metal prices retreated.  Rexel (RXL)  SA increased 1.9 percent in Paris
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended buying the shares.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  retreated 0.9 percent
to 294.8 at the close of trading after climbing 1.3 percent
yesterday on better-than-estimated U.S. factory orders data. The
gauge has still advanced 5.4 percent this year, closing at its
highest level since 2008 on March 14.  “We were certainly calling for a correction in developed
markets,” Stewart Richardson, chief investment officer at RMG
Wealth Management LLP, told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg
Television in  London . “We worry there is a bit of a slowdown in
terms of economic growth coming and certainly a continued
slowdown in corporate earnings. When the market has moved as
much as it has from autumn of last year, it is probably time for
a bit of a pause.”  Stocks extended losses after data showed the Institute for
Supply Management’s index of U.S. non-manufacturing businesses,
which covers almost 90 percent of the economy, fell to 54.4 in
March from 56 in the prior month. That fell short of economists’
median forecast for 55.5. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  Payrolls Miss  A U.S. payrolls report from the ADP Research Institute
showed companies added 158,000 workers in March, missing the
median economist forecast for 200,000 additions. The data comes
ahead of the Labor Department’s monthly non-farm payrolls report
on Friday.  National benchmark indexes declined in 15 of the 18 western
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX fell 0.9 percent, the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 slid 1.1 percent, and France’s CAC 40 lost 1.3 percent.  Portugal ’s PSI-20 Index plunged 3.5 percent, the most since
November 2011. Lenders led declines, with Banco Espirito Santo
SA, the nation’s largest, losing 8.8 percent.  Vodafone led a gauge of phone companies lower, falling 3.1
percent to 186.2 pence, after Verizon denied a Financial Times
report that said it had discussed a plan with AT&T Inc. to make
a joint offer for the U.K. telecommunications operator.  While Verizon reiterated interest in buying Vodafone’s
stake in the companies’ Verizon Wireless joint venture, it
doesn’t currently plan to bid for the whole company, according
to a filing yesterday.  Telecommunications Downgrade  Telecom Italia SpA lost 5.4 percent to 53.6 euro cents and
 France  Telecom SA retreated 4.4 percent to 7.66 euros after UBS
AG downgraded both phone companies to sell from neutral late
yesterday. Analysts cited downside earnings risk for Telecom
Italia, and cost cutting by competitors for France Telecom.  A gauge of European commodity producers slipped 2 percent,
for the second-biggest decline of the  19 industry groups  on the
Stoxx 600, as metals prices retreated. Kazakhmys lost 5.1
percent to 350.7 pence, extending the copper producer’s selloff
since March 20 to 28 percent. Evraz Plc fell 6 percent to 203.5
pence and Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. dropped 4.6 percent
to 224.6 pence.  Rexel climbed 1.9 percent to 17.69 euros after Goldman
Sachs raised its recommendation for the French electric
equipment distributor to buy from neutral, citing an
acceleration in the U.S. commercial market.  Neste Oil  Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V)  gained 4.8 percent to 12.04 euros. CA
Cheuvreux SA upgraded Finland’s only refiner to outperform, the
equivalent of a buy recommendation, from underperform, saying it
expects it to report resilient first-quarter results this month.  Pennon Group Plc added 4.1 percent to 650.5 pence as the
U.K.’s Daily Mail cited speculation that Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority may be interested in the British water company. The
newspaper didn’t identify its sources.  Panalpina Welttransport Holding AG soared 15 percent to
96.55 Swiss francs after the freight-forwarding company
appointed Peter Ulber as chief executive officer, replacing
Monika Ribar.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 today
was 6.5 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
