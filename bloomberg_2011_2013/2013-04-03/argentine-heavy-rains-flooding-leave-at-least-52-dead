Two days of heavy rains in Buenos
Aires city and in La Plata, capital of Buenos Aires province,
have left at least 52 dead and required the evacuation of
thousands of residents.  At least 46 people died in Buenos Aires, Governor Daniel Scioli told reporters today. Television showed images of ruined
homes and flooded neighborhoods. More than 250,000 people in the
city of Buenos Aires are without power. Rescue teams used boats
to evacuate residents.  “It was an unprecedented tragedy,” Scioli told reporters
today in La Plata.  Almost 200 millimeters (7.8 inches) of rain, which
represents more than the region’s monthly average, fell in La
Plata in the last 48 hours, said Pablo Mercuri, director of the
Weather and Water Institute at the National Institute of
Agriculture Technology.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  canceled a
presentation scheduled for today at 6 p.m. local time and
traveled to La Plata, where she met with residents and toured
the flooded areas.  “When I was a kid, my house got flooded, so I know what it
means to lose everything,” Fernandez said from La Plata, her
hometown. Fernandez signed a decree declaring three days of
mourning for the victims, according to the presidential website.  Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires will provide
subsidies and loans to aid residents affected by the flooding,
Scioli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
