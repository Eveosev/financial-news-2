Franklin Resources Inc., manager of
the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, said top-ranked bond
investor  Michael Hasenstab  will run a newly created U.S. mutual
fund that will invest in emerging market debt.  The Templeton Emerging Bond Fund will buy bonds from
governments and corporations, the San Mateo, California-based
company said today in a statement. Laura Burakreis will co-
manage the fund with Hasenstab, best-known for his $70 billion
 Templeton Global Bond Fund (TPINX) , which outperformed 90 percent of
peers over the past five years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We remain encouraged about the growth prospects and low
indebtedness of many emerging markets,” Hasenstab said in the
statement, citing strength in Asian economies outside of Japan,
and in some countries in Latin American and Europe.  Franklin managed $814 billion as of Feb. 28. Its  shares 
have gained 17 percent in 2013, ahead of the 15 percent gain in
the 20-member Standard & Poor’s index of custody banks and asset
managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
