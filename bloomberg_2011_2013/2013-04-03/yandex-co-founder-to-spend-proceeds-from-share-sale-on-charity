Ilya Segalovich, a founder of  Yandex
NV (YNDX) , Russia’s biggest Internet search engine, plans to spend
proceeds from a secondary share sale last month on charity
projects.  Yandex shareholders raised $607 million in the offering on
March 18, according to regulatory filings. Segalovich, who is
Yandex’s chief technology officer, sold 0.2 million shares,
while Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Arkady Volozh sold
5.1 million shares. Baring Vostok Capital Partners sold 18.2
million shares.  “The decision to sell shares was made due to financial
reasons, not because we don’t believe in the company’s future,”
Segalovich said in an interview with Bloomberg in St.
Petersburg. “I will spend the proceed for charity” Segalovich
said. “I sold a very small amount of shares.”  Segalovich is known as a donor to Maria’s Children, a
charity founded by his wife, Maria Yeliseyeva. The fund offers
arts education and other programs to orphans, its  website says .  To contact the reporter on this story:
