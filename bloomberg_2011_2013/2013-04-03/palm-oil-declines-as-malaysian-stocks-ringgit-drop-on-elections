Palm oil  fell with stocks and
ringgit in Malaysia after Prime Minister Najib Razak dissolved
parliament to face a resurgent opposition in elections.  The contract for delivery in June fell as much as 1.3
percent to 2,350 ringgit ($761) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and ended the morning session at 2,378
ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Prices have tumbled 33 percent in the
past year as stockpiles expanded amid slowing demand.  Najib’s 13-party Barisan Nasional coalition, which won the
2008 vote by its slimmest margin, faces a resurgent opposition
alliance led by former deputy prime minister  Anwar Ibrahim .
Under Malaysian law, elections must be held within 60 days of
dissolution. Malaysian stocks fell the most in eight weeks and
the ringgit slid for the first time in five days on speculation
the ruling coalition will lose support, derailing reforms.  “With the elections approaching, investors may avoid
holding ringgit-denominated assets on fear of political risks,”
Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said by
phone from Singapore. “Production is picking up in Malaysia but
gaining exports may cushion prices.”  Futures will trade between 2,400 ringgit and 2,700 ringgit
through May as ringgit weakens before elections,  Dorab Mistry ,
director at Godrej International Ltd., said March 22.  Exports rose 2.8 percent to 1.36 million tons in March from
a month ago, surveyor Intertek said on April 1. Shipments rose
5.5 percent to 1.37 million tons, Societe Generale de
Surveillance said.  Soybean oil for May delivery slid 0.3 percent to 49.42
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May fell 0.8 percent to $13.825 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 0.5 percent
to 6,256  yuan  ($1,009) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month retreated 0.2 percent
to 7,864 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
