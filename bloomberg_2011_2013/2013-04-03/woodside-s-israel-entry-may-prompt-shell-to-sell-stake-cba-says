Woodside Petroleum Ltd.’s agreement
to acquire a stake in  Israel ’s largest natural gas field may
prompt  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to sell the rest of its holding in
the Perth-based company,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  said.  “We anticipate a sell-down to dispel any perception
amongst other Middle Eastern countries that Shell is investing
either directly or indirectly in Israel,” considering the
geopolitical tension and Shell’s significant investment in the
region outside the country, Luke Smith and Lachlan Cuskelly,
Sydney-based analysts at CBA, said in a March 27 report.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s largest oil and gas producer,
is a potential buyer of Woodside, the analysts said. Any sale of
the shares would probably occur after Woodside, which agreed in
December to buy 30 percent of the Leviathan gas field in Israel
for an initial $696 million, considers an  investment decision  on
the proposed Browse liquefied natural gas project in Australia
in mid-2013, according to the report.  Shell, which still owns a 23 percent stake valued at A$6.9
billion ($7.2 billion), said last year that the stake didn’t fit
in with the company’s long-term plans.Woodside, Australia’s
second-largest oil and gas producer, has slumped in Sydney
trading since The Hague-based Shell sold 10 percent of the
company at A$42.23 a share in November 2010.  Woodside’s shares rose 0.8 percent today to A$36.29 at
10:30 a.m. Sydney time.  Paul Zennaro, a Melbourne-based spokesman for Shell, said
the company wouldn’t comment on speculation. Fiona Hadley, a
Melbourne-based spokeswoman for BHP, said the company doesn’t
comment on market speculation. Laura Lunt, a spokeswoman for
Woodside in Perth, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
