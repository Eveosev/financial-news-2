Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) ,  Nigeria ’s sixth-
largest lender by market value, said full-year profit more than
doubled as customer deposits increased.  Net income advanced to 38.6 billion naira ($244 million) in
2012 from 14.5 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based
lender said in a statement today on the website of the  Nigerian
Stock Exchange . Revenue rose 54 percent to 208.3 billion naira
as loans and advances to customers climbed 5 percent to 604
billion naira. Deposits grew 9 percent to 1.2 trillion naira.  Access restrained its loan book following it’s purchase of
Intercontinental Bank Plc in 2011, Chief Executive Officer
Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede said in October. An increased levy this
year on banks by the state-owned Asset Management Corp. of
Nigeria, created in 2010 to buy bad debts from lenders, may
erode earnings this year, said Olubunmi Asaolu, an analyst at
FBN Capital Ltd.  The bank’s  shares  were up 0.1 percent to 10.50 naira at the
close in Lagos, the highest since March 14. Access has advanced
16 percent this year compared with the 25 percent gain of the
 Bloomberg NSE Banking Index. (NGSEB10)   To contact the reporter on this story:
