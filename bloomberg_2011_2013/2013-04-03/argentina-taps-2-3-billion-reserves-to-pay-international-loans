Argentina  will use $2.3 billion of
central bank  reserves  this year to meet payments to
international financing organizations and on its official
bilateral debt, according to the  official gazette.   In exchange, the central bank will receive dollar-
denominated, non-transferable 10-year Treasury notes that pay
the same interest as the bank receives on international reserves
up to a maximum of Libor minus one percentage point, the gazette
said.  About $11.3 million of the $2.3 billion are to make up for
payments that fell due last year that had been under-estimated,
according to the gazette.  Central bank officials didn’t return phone calls seeking
comments.  President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, unable to borrow
from international markets since the country’s 2001 debt
default, has used reserves since 2010 to pay international debt.
The government plans to use about $8 billion this year from $5.7
billion last year, according to the budget law.  The use of reserves to pay debt, plus capital outflows,
caused central bank savings to fall to $40.6 billion on March
27, the lowest level since 2007. In early 2006, Fernandez’s
husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner used reserves to pay off
its $9.5 billion debt to the  International Monetary Fund , a move
he said was giving the country “liberty to make national
decisions.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
