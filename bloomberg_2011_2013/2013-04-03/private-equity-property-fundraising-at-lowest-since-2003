Private-equity fundraising for  real
estate  dropped to the lowest level in almost a decade as the
process of collecting capital from investors lengthened to more
than double the time spent in 2007, Preqin Ltd. said.  About $5.2 billion was raised globally by 20 closed-end
funds, a 79 percent decline from the previous three months and
the lowest since the third quarter of 2003, the London-based
research firm said today in a statement. Funds that held final
closings in the period were marketed for an average of 18.7
months, compared with 9.2 months in 2007, near the commercial
real estate market’s peak, Preqin said.  “Although investor appetite for private real estate funds
has increased in recent months, competition for limited partner
commitments remains intense and fundraising for most managers is
a long, difficult process,” Andrew Moylan, Preqin’s head of
real assets products, said in the statement.  Boston-based Rockpoint Group LLC had the biggest final
closing of the first quarter, a $1.95 billion fund for
distressed and value-added property in the U.S., U.K. and Japan,
according to Preqin. Prime Finance Partners LLC, based in New
York, followed with a $621 million U.S. debt fund, and
Birmingham, Alabama-based  Harbert Management Corp . was third
with a 254 million-euro ($326 million) European fund.  Funds with a North America focus raised the most capital,
with 12 receiving commitments of a combined $3.7 billion, Preqin
said. Five Asia-focused funds got $776 million and three Europe
funds got $756 million, according to the research firm, which
compiles data that it sells to alternative-asset managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
