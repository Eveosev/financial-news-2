Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) ,  Nigeria ’s third-
largest lender by market value, jumped to the highest level in
more than 4 1/2 years after it reported that full-year profit
doubled as costs fell.  The lender advanced 2.9 percent to close at 22.28 naira in
Lagos, the commercial capital where Zenith is based, the highest
since Sept. 1, 2008. Zenith has added 14 percent this year,
compared with the 25 percent gain for the  Bloomberg NSE Banking
Index (NGSEB10) , which tracks Nigeria’s top 10 banks by market value.  Net income rose to 100.68 billion naira ($636 million) in
2012 from 48.7 billion naira a year earlier, as its cost-to-
income ratio fell to 54 percent from 63 percent, Zenith reported
late yesterday.  “Zenith’s operating efficiency showed material
improvement” driving earnings higher, Muyiwa Oni and Rele Adesina, Lagos-based analysts at  Stanbic IBTC Holding Co. (STANBIC) , wrote
in an e-mailed note today.  Zenith doesn’t expect Nigerian bank industry earnings this
year to be “as aggressive” as in 2012, Chief Executive Officer
Godwin Emefiele said in a March 21 interview. Earnings may be
affected as the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria, set up in
2010 to buy lenders’ bad debts, requires banks to pay more
toward the cost of saving the industry, according to Emefiele.  To contact the reporter on this story:
