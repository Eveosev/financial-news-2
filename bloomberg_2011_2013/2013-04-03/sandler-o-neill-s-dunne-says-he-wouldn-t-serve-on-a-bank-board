Jimmy Dunne, co-founder of Sandler
O’Neill & Partners LP, said he wouldn’t serve on a bank board as
regulations make membership time-consuming and complicated.  “If you thought there would be x-amount of meetings,
triple it,” Dunne, senior managing principal of the New York-
based investment bank, said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview with  Erik Schatzker  and  Stephanie Ruhle . “It is not
easy. It’s complicated, very time-consuming.”  Bank directors have been criticized since the financial
crisis for failing to detect risky practices and lax standards.
Investors have called for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  to drop his chairman title following a
derivative trade that resulted in more than $6.2 billion in
losses last year.  Separating the CEO and chairman roles won’t necessarily
solve issues such as excessive risk-taking at lenders and could
instead result in competing agendas, Dunne said.  Boards need “members that understand and can challenge at
the appropriate times,” said Dunne, 56, who sits on the
 University of Notre Dame ’s board. “They have to ask certain
questions like, ‘How much leverage do we have?’ That is a good
question. I do not think they need to have a chairman separate
to ask that question.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
