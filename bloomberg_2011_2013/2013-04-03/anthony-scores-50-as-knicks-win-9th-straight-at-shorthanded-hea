Carmelo Anthony tied a career high
with 50 points and the  New York  Knicks won their ninth straight
game 102-90 at the Miami Heat, whose leading scorers LeBron James and Dwyane Wade were sidelined with injuries.  Anthony, accumulating 50 points for the third time in his
National Basketball Association career, was 18 of 26 from the
floor, including 7 of 10 on 3-pointers last night at
AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami.  “I’m healthy, that’s a big key for me,” Anthony, the
Knicks’ leading scorer this season, said in a televised
interview. “I feel good.”  James and Wade both have leg injuries. James has a strained
right hamstring and Wade a sprained right ankle. Starting point
guard Mario Chalmers also was out because of a right ankle
sprain, the Heat said yesterday in a Twitter post.  “The No. 1 thing, obviously, is try to get as healthy as
we can,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra told reporters. “From there,
we have time to still try to improve -- not just stay in rhythm,
but to improve.”  Miami (58-16) is atop the Eastern Conference, 10 1/2 games
better than the Knicks and Indiana Pacers. The Knicks (47-26)
hold the top spot in the conference’s Atlantic division, five
games ahead of the Brooklyn Nets.  Anthony gave the Knicks an 8-0 lead in the first two
minutes of the game and ended the first quarter with 17 of his
team’s 27 points.  “My goal was to come out and attack it,” Anthony said.
“We got back to having fun playing basketball. We’ll try to
finish the season strong.”  Mike Miller, who had 18 points, helped the Heat build a 58-
50 halftime lead. The Knicks outscored Miami by 10 points in the
third period and led by two points entering the fourth quarter.  The Knicks held Miami without a basket in the final seven
minutes, 54 seconds of the game and finished with a 12-2 run.  J.R. Smith came off the bench to score 14 points for the
Knicks and Raymond Felton added 10. Chris Bosh scored 23 points
and reserve Ray Allen contributed 16 for the Heat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
