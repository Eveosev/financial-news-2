SACI Falabella (FALAB) , a retailer that is
 Chile ’s largest listed company, fell the most in 18 months as
foreign investors sold its shares in search of regional
alternatives with lower valuations.  The stock retreated 3.5 percent to 5,450 pesos at 1:40 p.m.
in Santiago, the biggest drop on a closing basis since October
2011. The company was the worst performer on the benchmark Ipsa
index, which fell 0.8 percent to its lowest level since Jan. 2.  “We are seeing lots of sales from foreign investors, which
were among the most buyers in the stock’s recent surge,” Aldo Morales, an analyst at the brokerage unit of Bice Inversiones in
Santiago, said in a telephone interview. “The local market
doesn’t look very attractive from a multiples point of view so
they seem to be moving elsewhere.”  Falabella has retreated 4.4 percent over two days after
posting an 8.8 percent rally in the previous 10 days, its
longest winning streak since December 2009.  The company, which operates supermarkets, department
stores, home improvement stores, banks and shopping malls in
Chile, Argentina,  Colombia  and  Peru , trades at 37 times its
trailing earnings, compared with an average 32 for Latin
American retailers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chile’s  Ipsa (IPSA)  index trades at 17 times its estimated
earnings for the next 12 months, compared with 11 times for
Brazil’s Bovespa, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
