The Pittsburgh Penguins’ streak
ended at 15 wins, two shy of their own National Hockey League
record, in their first game without injured captain Sidney Crosby, who is out indefinitely with a broken jaw.  Kevin Porter scored two goals to help the Buffalo Sabres
win 4-1 at Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh last night. Porter
scored midway through the first period and added a second goal
early in the second. Steve Ott and Cody Hodgson also scored for
the Sabres.  “We just didn’t have much of an answer,” Pittsburgh
defenseman Matt Niskanen told reporters. “Things weren’t going
well from the start and we didn’t have a whole lot of a pushback
or a whole lot of urgency.”  Crosby, who has a league-high 56 points this season, was
injured four days ago when he was hit in the mouth by a
deflected puck against the  New York  Islanders in the last of the
Penguins’ 15 wins from as many games last month.  Jarome Iginla had a power-play goal in the first period for
the Penguins, who set the NHL winning streak record with Mario Lemieux leading the 1992-93 team.  “It’s a tough feeling,” said Iginla, who was playing his
second game with the Penguins. “But at the same time it’s very
impressive to see what this group accomplished.”  The Penguins (28-9-0) top the Eastern Conference with 56
points, second best in the NHL behind the Chicago Blackhawks,
who have 57 points.  The Sabres (14-17-6) are last in the Eastern Conference’s
five-team Northeast Division with 34 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
