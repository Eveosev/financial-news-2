British Airways (IAG)  parent IAG said it
will buy 18 additional  Boeing Co. (BA)  787s and possibly more
Dreamliners for its Iberia arm once restructuring measures for
the Spanish unit take hold.  British Airways is exercising existing options for 787s to
be delivered from 2017 through 2021 and phase out Boeing
747-400s, IAG said in a statement today. They will be powered by
 Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/)  Trent 1000 engines, IAG said.  British Airways had previously ordered 24 787s and is due
to start taking deliveries this year once Boeing begins handing
over aircraft again after Dreamliner operations were halted on
Jan. 16. Boeing is working with regulators to certify an upgrade
to the 787 electrical system after fire incidents caused U.S.
 Federal Aviation Administration  to ground the fleet.  “The aircraft offers a step change in fuel burn efficiency
versus our existing aircraft with improvements in fuel cost per
seat of more than 20 percent,”  Willie Walsh , chief executive
officer of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, as
London-based IAG is known, said in the statement.  IAG said it has also secured an unspecified number of
additional delivery slots for future Iberia needs, saying the
creating of the parent company has resulted in greater buying
power for both airlines. Iberia currently operates Airbus SAS
wide-bodies for its intercontinental flights.  “We are delighted that our valued customer IAG plans to
increase the number of 787s in the British Airways fleet, which
is testament to the 787s unrivaled fuel efficiency and passenger
comfort,” Boeing said in an emailed statement, adding the deal
still needs to be finalized.  To contact the reporters on this story:
