MagicJack VocalTec Ltd. (CALL)  surged to a
three-month high in New York after the Israeli company whose
founders pioneered voice-over-Internet technology posted the
first annual operating profit since its 1996 listing.  Shares of MagicJack jumped 5.7 percent to $15.80 by 1:08
p.m., the highest level since Jan. 8, after earlier rallying as
much as 15 percent. Trading volume was more than five times the
daily average over the past three months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. MagicJack was the biggest gainer on the
 Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest Israeli
companies traded in New York, which fell 0.9 percent to 89.20.  Operating income for Netanya, Israel-based MagicJack was
$43.6 million last year, compared with a loss of $4.6 million
for 2011, the company said in a statement released after U.S.
markets closed yesterday. Net revenue, which MagicJack defines
as net of returns and allowances, was $158.4 million, up 43
percent from a year ago, said the company, whose products allow
phone calls to be made over the Internet.  “Clearly demand for this technology has been increasing,”
Fran Caulfield, research director at Mountain Lakes, New Jersey-
based Insight Research Corp., which focuses on
telecommunications companies, said by phone. “We will still
see, at least in the short term, these kinds of growth rates are
possible.”  MagicJack  shares  have slumped 40 percent from a September
high and 59 percent of its tradeable stock was sold short by
investors as of the March 15 settlement date. That’s the highest
short interest percentage among all companies on the Nasdaq
Composite Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
