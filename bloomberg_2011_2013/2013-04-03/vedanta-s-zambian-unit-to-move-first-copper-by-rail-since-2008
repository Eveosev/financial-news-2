  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) ’s Zambian
unit will transport copper from its Chingola mines to Tanzania
by rail instead of road for the first time in five years to
lower costs.  Konkola Copper Mines Plc plans to ship 70,000 metric tons
of the metal using trains by March next year, Joy Sata, a
spokeswoman, said in an interview on April 2. The company plans
to move the majority of its copper by rail eventually, she said.  “The cost savings will be huge,” Sata said in Chingola,
320 kilometers (198 miles) north of Lusaka, the capital. “It
will reduce the transport cost tremendously.”  Railway operators in Zambia, Africa’s biggest copper
producer, plan to invest over $1.5 billion over the next five
years to upgrade the system that President  Michael Sata  on Nov.
15 said had “deteriorated beyond description.” The government
plans to move freight back onto the railways to ease traffic
congestion and reduce maintenance costs of the road network.  KCM, as the company is called, transports 70 percent of its
copper by truck from Chingola to Kapiri Mposhi, about 210
kilometers away, Sata said. The metal is then transported by
rail to the Tanzanian port of  Dar es Salaam , about 1,400
kilometers northeast, she said.  The remaining 30 percent of the company’s copper production
is exported almost 2,500 kilometers by road to the port of
Durban in  South Africa .  KCM, in which Vedanta has a 79 percent stake, plans to
start copper production from two new open pits in Chingola by
the end of the year, Mineral Resources Manager Ashok Singh said
in an interview. The company is also increasing underground
production there, in an expansion that will raise copper output
to about 200,000 tons yearly from its mines in Chingola, he
said. This will cost $200 million to $300 million, he said.  Chililabombwe Deepening  KCM is also completing a deepening of its underground mine
in Chililabombwe, about 21 kilometers north of Chingola, which
will increase copper production at the operation to about
200,000 tons a year. The mine extends 1,505 meters below
surface, making it one of  Africa ’s deepest copper operations,
according to the company. It is also one of the wettest, and has
to pump out 320,000 cubic meters (85 million gallons) of water
daily, equal to about 128 Olympic swimming pools, according to
Billy Sakala, a manager at the mine.  Vedanta shares  climbed 1.7 percent to 1,009 pence by the
close in  London  yesterday, paring the decline this year to 13
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
