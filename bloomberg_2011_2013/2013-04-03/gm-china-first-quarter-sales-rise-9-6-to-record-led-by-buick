General Motors Co. (GM) ’s first-quarter
sales in China, the world’s largest auto market, climbed 9.6
percent to a record, led by deliveries of its Buick vehicles and
Wuling microvans.  Sales last month increased 13 percent from a year earlier,
bringing the January-to-March tally to 816,373 vehicles, GM said
on its website today. First-quarter Buick and Wuling deliveries
rose 16 percent and 12 percent, respectively, while Cadillac
sales fell 4.6 percent.  GM, vying with  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  for the lead among foreign
automakers in the world’s largest auto market, has lured buyers
from Japanese brands as sovereignty dispute over islets in the
East China Sea caused an anti-Japan backlash.  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) ,  Nissan Motor (7201)  Co. and Honda Motor Co. all saw their China
sales fall during the first quarter.  Among GM’s brands, Wuling accounted for almost half of
sales during the quarter. GM has said it aims to increase total
China sales by 75 percent to 5 million vehicles a year by 2015.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
