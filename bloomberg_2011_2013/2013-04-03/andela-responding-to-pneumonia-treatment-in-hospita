Former South African President
 Nelson Mandela  is responding to treatment for pneumonia as he
remains hospitalized for a seventh day.  Mandela, 94, remains at an undisclosed hospital in
Pretoria,  Mac Maharaj , a spokesman for President  Jacob Zuma ,
said in a phone interview today.  South Africa’s first black president was admitted to the
hospital before midnight on March 27 to treat pneumonia, with
doctors performing a procedure to drain liquid from his lungs
during the weekend. Mandela has been hospitalized three times
since December, including a scheduled check-up last month.  Zuma said in a pre-recorded interview broadcast on CNBC
Africa yesterday that South Africans shouldn’t have a “lot of
anxiety” regarding Mandela’s health. The country must “take it
easy” and the former president will eventually return to his
home, he said.  Mandela served as president for five years after the
 African National Congress  in 1994 won the first elections since
the end of all-white, minority rule. He spent 27 years in prison
for opposing apartheid, most of it spent on Robben Island where
he contracted tuberculosis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
