Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX)  increased its offer for  Obagi Medical
Products Inc. (OMPI)  to about $417 million, to counter a competing bid
for the maker of prescription skin care products. Obagi rose
above the new offer in early trading.  Valeant’s new offer of $24 a share is an increase from the
$19.75 bid the companies agreed to last month. Obagi’s board
unanimously supports the amended bid, Montreal-based Valeant
said in a statement today.  Valeant’s move tops closely held Merz Pharma Group’s offer
of $22 a share. The bid from Merz Pharma was unsolicited, Long
Beach, California-based Obagi said after the proposal from the
Frankfurt-based company was announced yesterday.  Obagi rose 8.8 percent to $24.89 at 8:33 a.m.  New York 
time, topping the new Valeant bid and indicating that investors
may expect an even higher offer. The company had gained 49
percent from March 19, the day before Valeant’s $19.75 offer was
made public, through yesterday.  Obagi’s biggest product is Nu-Derm, an anti-aging
treatment. The therapy had about $62 million in sales last year.  Obagi’s investors have been pushing for a sale of the
company, led partly by Voce Capital LLC, a hedge fund. In
December, the fund’s managing partner J. Daniel Plants wrote the
board and called for its replacement and a more thorough sale
process than it said Obagi had previously conducted.  Valeant’s new offer will expire April 23 at midnight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
