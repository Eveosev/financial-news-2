European Union pig prices were
stable this week in a quiet market, with hogs unchanged in
 Germany  and Spain, industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V. reported.  Hog prices in Germany, the EU’s biggest producer, were
1.626 euros ($2.09) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) for a sixth week,
while in Spain pigs were 1.818 euros a kilogram for a fourth
week, Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in an online  report  today.  Pork accounts for about half of meat consumption in the EU.
Average consumption of pork in the 27-nation bloc is forecast to
fall to 40.1 kilograms per person this year from 40.5 kilograms
in 2012, the EU reported last month.  “The market again shows itself quiet with at the most
slight price changes, and the price gauge in general moves
sideways,” ISN wrote.  In France, the EU’s third-biggest pig producer, prices
slipped for a second week to 1.671 euros a kilogram from 1.678
euros, while hogs were unchanged in  Denmark , the Netherlands,
Belgium,  Austria  and Ireland, according to ISN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
