Two cases of Chateau Leoville
Poyferre 2010, a second-growth Bordeaux red wine from
Saint-Julien, sold for 965 pounds ($1,460) each on the London-
based Liv-ex wine exchange yesterday, its lowest level for five
weeks, according to Liv-ex data.  The vintage fetched as much as 1,016 pounds a case on
March 7, its highest level since June 2011, before declining in
trades over the past month. Leoville Poyferre is a neighboring
estate to Chateau Leoville-Las-Cases and Chateau
Leoville Barton, and the 2010 vintage is its third-most
expensive of the past decade after the 2009 and 2003 wines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
