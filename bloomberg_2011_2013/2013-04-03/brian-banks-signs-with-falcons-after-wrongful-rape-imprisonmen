The  Atlanta Falcons  signed
linebacker Brian Banks, a former standout high-school recruit
who spent five years in jail after being falsely accused of
rape.  Banks, 27, unsuccessfully tried out for several National
Football League teams last year without getting signed to a
contract. He joined the  United Football League ’s Las Vegas
Locomotives, playing in two games and recording one tackle.  After being accused of rape by a former Long Beach,
California, high school classmate at age 16, Banks pleaded
guilty on the advice of his attorney and spent five years in
jail, the  Associated Press  reported at the time. He then spent
five years on probation before his accuser contacted him and
said she lied. The case was dismissed by a judge in May, AP
said.  “We are pleased to have Brian join our team,” Falcons
General Manager Thomas Dimitroff said on the team’s website.
“He has worked extremely hard for this chance over the last
year and he has shown us that he is prepared for this
opportunity.”  The 6-foot-2, 250-pound Banks had committed to playing at
the University of  Southern California  before being jailed. He
would have to make the Falcons’ 53-man roster to play in the
NFL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
