German 10-year  government bonds 
stayed little changed after a report showed consumer prices in
the euro area rose at a faster pace than economists predicted.  The yield on the 1.75 percent bund maturing February 2023
was at 1.31 percent at 10:03 a.m. London time. Two-year rates
were little changed at minus 0.001 percent.  Annual price growth in the 17-nation economy was 1.7
percent last month, down from 1.8 percent in February, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That compares with the 1.6 percent median of 44 economists’
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
