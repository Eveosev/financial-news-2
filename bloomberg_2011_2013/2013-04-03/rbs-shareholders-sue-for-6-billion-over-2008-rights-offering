Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and
directors including former chief executive officer Fred Goodwin
were sued by about 12,000 shareholders over the bank’s 2008
rights offering a few months before a government bailout.  The investors may seek as much as 4 billion pounds ($6
billion) in the class-action suit filed today in London, the
RBOS Shareholder Action Group said in a statement. It’s the
second complaint in less than a week against the bank after
pension funds and investment firms sued over the rights issue on
March 28.  RBS is 81 percent owned by British taxpayers after getting
the world’s biggest bank bailout -- 45.5 billion pounds -- in
2008 and 2009. The lender had raised 12 billion
pounds from investors in the share sale before collapsing under
the weight of bad loans.  “Directors sought to mislead shareholders by
misrepresenting the underlying strength of the bank and omitting
critical information from the 2008 rights issue prospectus,”
said Locksley Ryan, the group’s spokesman.  Former RBS chairman Tom McKillop, ex-head of corporate
markets Johnny Cameron and former finance director Guy Whittaker
were also named in the suit filed today in  London .  David Gaffney, a spokesman for Edinburgh-based RBS,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
