China’s stocks  dropped to a 14-week
low as concerns over a new strain of avian flu overshadowed data
showing growth in the nation’s services industries.  Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group Co. (002385) , which makes  animal
feed , sank to a more than three-month low as  Shanghai  issued an
alert over the bird flu strain that has killed two people in the
city.  Wintime Energy Co. (600157)  was the third-biggest drag on the
benchmark index because of a share-sale plan.  Hualan Biological
Engineering Inc. (002007)  led gains by drug makers.  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  increased 0.7 percent on plans to
buy 20 percent of Taiwan’s Bank Sinopac.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  closed 0.1 percent lower at
2,225.3, the lowest level since Dec. 27. More than two stocks
fell for each one that rose. The gauge lost 0.5 percent this
week, a second weekly loss. Markets will be shut the next two
days for holidays. The CSI 300 Index declined 0.1 percent to
2,483.55.  “Stock valuations are low and the economy has halted its
decline in growth,” said  Zhang Ling , general manager at
Shanghai River Fund Management Co. “From these two aspects,
stocks are cheap and don’t have a big room for declines. Bird
flu is a good thematic investment especially when the market has
no clear direction.”  Thirty-day  volatility  on the Shanghai Composite sank to a
two-week low of 21.8, while the gauge’s trading volumes were 25
percent higher than the 30-day average today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Lower Volatility  The Shanghai index slumped 8.6 percent from a Feb. 6 high
amid concern steps to cool property prices will drag on economic
growth and as company earnings trailed estimates. Valuations on
the gauge sank to 9.1 times projected 12-month earnings, the
lowest level since Dec. 13 and less than the seven-year average
of 15.8,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show  The non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index, a gauge
of the nation’s services industries, rose to 55.6 from 54.5 in

signal expansion. A separate services gauge from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics rose to 54.3 from 52.1.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  lost 0.5 percent today. The  Bloomberg China-
US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, added 0.7 percent yesterday.  Beijing Dabeinong sank 1.9 percent to 20.70  yuan , its
lowest close since Dec. 21, on speculation the bird-flu strain
will lower demand for its products.  Henan Shuanghui Investment &
Development Co. (000895) , which manufactures pork products, slumped 5.7
percent to 72.60 yuan. New Hope Liuhe Co., an animal feed
producer, slid 3.4 percent to 11.36 yuan.  Avian Flu  Hualan Biological jumped 6.5 percent to 26.15 yuan, while

vaccines, gained 3.2 percent to 13.64 yuan. The two bird-flu
deaths in Shanghai were among at least seven infected in eastern
China.  Shanghai issued a level-3 flu alert, the second-lowest
stage of four levels. Municipal authorities will strengthen
monitoring of influenza and will require daily reporting of
pneumonia cases where the causes are unknown, Xu Jianguang, head
of Shanghai’s health and family planning commission, said at a

in February.  China CSSC Holdings Ltd. (600150) , a unit of the nation’s biggest
shipbuilder, rose 2.7 percent to 19.69 yuan, while Guangzhou
Shipyard International Co. added 1.4 percent to 11.59 yuan. The
government will issue measures in the near term to support the
development of the ship-building industry for the three years
through 2015, the China Securities Journal reported today,
citing an industry association.  GD Midea Holding Co. (000527) , an appliance maker, surged 10 percent

we had last year when valuations reached lows in history,” said
Michael Ding, lead manager of the China Region Fund at U.S.

$2.2 billion.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Darren Boey, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
