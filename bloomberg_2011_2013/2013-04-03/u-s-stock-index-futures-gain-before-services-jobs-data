U.S.  stocks  fell, dragging the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down from a record, as financial and energy shares tumbled after oil plunged and worse-than-estimated data spurred concern over economic growth.  Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley dropped more than 2.7 percent as financial shares tumbled the most among 10  S&P 500   groups .

The median forecast of 73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 55.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion.
