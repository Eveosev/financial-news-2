Germany ’s Bundesbank is looking into
allegations by former  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  employees that the lender
hid losses during the financial crisis, a person with knowledge
of the matter said.  The central bank’s investigation isn’t at an advanced stage
as officials examine the validity of the claims, said the person,
who requested anonymity because the proceedings are confidential.
German investigators are planning to fly to New York next week
to conduct interviews with people including former bankers, the
Financial Times reported yesterday. Michele Allison, a
spokeswoman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, said the
allegations aren’t true.  The claims “have been the subject of a careful and
thorough investigation, and they are wholly unfounded,” Allison
said in an e-mailed statement. “We have and will continue to
cooperate fully with our regulators on this matter.”  Deutsche Bank hired law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver &
Jacobson LLP in March 2010 to conduct an internal probe after a
trader alleged the lender masked paper losses during the
financial crisis, Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause, 50,
told analysts and investors on a conference call in December.
The bank reported the claims to U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the CFO said. The SEC hasn’t brought an enforcement
action.  Deutsche Bank  fell  0.9 percent to 30.50 euros by 9:05 a.m.
in Frankfurt trading. The shares have declined 7.3 percent this
year, compared with the 8.4 percent drop in the 28-company Euro
Stoxx Banks Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
