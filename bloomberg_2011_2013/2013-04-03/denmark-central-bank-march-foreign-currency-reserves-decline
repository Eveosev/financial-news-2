Denmark’s currency reserves declined
in March as the central bank sold foreign exchange.  Foreign reserves  fell by 1.3 billion kroner ($224 million)
to 481.9 billion kroner, Copenhagen-based Nationalbanken said
today in a statement. There were no interventions in the
 currency markets , it said.  “The krone seems to be where the central bank wants it,”
said Helge Pedersen, chief economist at Nordea Bank AB. “Seems
it’ll be quiet in the office this week for the central bank as
we’re not expecting them to change rates tomorrow either.”  The krone appreciated through the first quarter after a
January rate increase and as Italian political turmoil and the
Cyprus bailout renewed concern that the region’s debt crisis
would deepen. Denmark emerged as a haven last year as investors
hedged against a potential break-up of the euro area.  The bank had through January spent a net 17.1 billion
kroner to back the currency as the crisis eased in the second
half of last year. It sold 36.9 billion kroner in the first six
months of 2012.  The bank, which pegs the krone in a band around 7.46038 per
euro, also raised its key lending rate from a record in January
to defend the peg. The bank raised its lending rate to 0.3
percent from 0.2 percent and its deposit rate to minus 0.1
percent from minus 0.2 percent.  The krone rose 0.01 percent against the euro in March,
after gaining 0.05 percent in February. It slid for seven
consecutive months through January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
