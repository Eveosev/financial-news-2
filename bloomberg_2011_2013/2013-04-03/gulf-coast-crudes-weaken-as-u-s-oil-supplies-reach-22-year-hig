Gulf Coast crudes weakened on the
spot market as U.S. oil supplies reached the highest level in 22
years and as the restart of a crude unit at the nation’s largest
refinery was said to be delayed another week.  Inventories rose 2.71 million barrels to 388.6 million last
week, the largest supply since 1990, the Energy Information
Administration said today. Motiva Enterprises LLC’s 600,000-
barrel-a-day plant in Port Arthur, Texas, will keep a crude unit
shut for a week more after repairs ran behind schedule, said two
people familiar with the matter.  Light Louisiana Sweet weakened 25 cents to a premium of
$16.85 a barrel over benchmark West Texas Intermediate as of
2:04 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Mars Blend, Poseidon, Southern Green Canyon, and
Thunder Horse grades each lost more than $1 a barrel relative to
WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet bucked the trend, strengthening 75
cents to an $18 premium.  West Texas Sour strengthened 20 cents to a 15-cent discount
to WTI, while Midland WTI gained 15 cents to trade at a 10-cent
discount to the same grade delivered to the U.S. storage hub in
Cushing, Oklahoma.  Oil from North Dakota’s Bakken formation delivered by
pipeline to Clearbrook, Minnesota, weakened by 50 cents to trade
at a $2 premium to WTI. The majority of Bakken oil is
transported by rail.  In Canada, Western Canada Select heavy oil strengthened by
20 cents to a $14 discount, according to Calgary oil broker Net
Energy Inc. The price of Syncrude, a light oil produced from
oil-sands bitumen, weakened by 20 cents against WTI to a $9.80
premium, the broker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
