Swiss stocks  advanced for a third
day, extending a five-year high, as investors awaited reports on
U.S. employment and services industries.  Nestle SA (NESN) , the biggest stock in the  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , led
the benchmark measure higher. Meyer Burger Technology AG slipped
1.4 percent after announcing a plan to sell shares.  The SMI added 0.3 percent to 7,924 at 9:24 a.m. in Zurich,
its highest level since January 2008. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also advanced 0.3 percent.  U.S.  service industries , which account for about 90 percent
of the economy, grew at a slower pace last month, a report may
show today. The Institute for Supply Management’s non-
manufacturing index slipped to 55.5 in March from 56 in
February, according to the median economist estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  A separate private report based on payrolls from the ADP
Research Institute may show companies added 200,000 workers in
March. The data comes before Friday’s monthly jobs report from
the Labor Department.  Nestle advanced 0.6 percent to 69.85 Swiss francs. The
world’s largest food company is trading at the highest price
since at least 1989.  Meyer Burger (MBTN)  dropped 1.4 percent to 7.71 francs, snapping a
four-day rally. The supplier of machinery to solar-panel makers
plans to sell as many as 48.2 million new shares. They would be
offered to existing shareholders through subscription rights,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
