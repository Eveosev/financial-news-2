EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)  dropped to
the lowest level more than nine months after Egypt’s biggest
publicly traded investment bank reported a fourth-quarter loss.  The shares declined 2.1 percent to 9.49 pounds, the lowest
since June 24, at the close in Cairo. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
retreated 2.2 percent.  The bank reported a loss of 21 million pounds ($3.1
million) after tax and before minority interest compared with a
profit of 30 million pounds a year earlier, according to a
statement to the Egyptian and London stock exchanges today.
Group operating expenses for the quarter rose 14 percent to 407
million pounds, while revenue increased 7 percent.  EFG-Hermes said employee expenses, a one-time tax payment
and accrued utility bills in its commercial and  investment
banking  arms contributed to the higher costs. The bank is in the
process of selling a majority stake of its main business lines
of investment banking, asset management and brokerage to Qatar’s
QInvest LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
