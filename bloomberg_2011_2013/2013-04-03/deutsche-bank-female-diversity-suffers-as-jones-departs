Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  deputy finance
chief  Charlotte  Jones, one of the company’s most senior female
executives, plans to leave Europe’s second-largest bank.  Jones, Chief Financial Officer  Stefan Krause ’s deputy, will
leave Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank this month, spokesman Armin Niedermeier said today in a phone interview. He declined to
provide further details.  The departure may set back Deutsche Bank’s effort to boost
female representation in management. The lender, which has no
women on either of its two highest executive committees, intends
to increase the number of female senior executives it employs to
25 percent by the end of 2018 from 17 percent in 2011, according
to its 2011 financial report. Deutsche Bank’s management board
has seven members, who also sit, along with 11 colleagues, on
the group executive committee.  Jones joined the bank in 2004, oversaw its implementation
of new accounting rules and represented the lender in talks over
Greece’s creditors taking losses on their bonds to rescue the
country in 2011 and 2012, Die Zeit reported earlier today.  Unlike some countries in Europe,  Germany  hasn’t set quotas
to improve the balance of female representation in corporate
management. Deutsche Bank and the other companies listed on
Germany’s benchmark DAX Index have instead made a voluntary
commitment to increase the proportion of female executives.  Deutsche Bank is Europe’s largest bank by assets after  HSBC
Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
