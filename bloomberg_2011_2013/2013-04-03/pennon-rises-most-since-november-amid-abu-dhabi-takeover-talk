Pennon Group Plc (PNN)   rose  the most in
four months in London trading after the Daily Mail reported that
state-owned Abu Dhabi Investment Authority may bid for the U.K.
waste and water company.  The stock gained 4.1 percent to 650.50 pence, the biggest
advance since Nov. 29, after the newspaper said the Abu Dhabi
group may offer as much as 24 percent more than yesterday’s
closing price. Pennon and ADIA declined to comment.  While water utilities offer stable, low-risk returns backed
by assets and linked to the Retail Price Index, Pennon is the
least likely takeover candidate of the U.K.’s three biggest
publicly traded water companies, John Musk, an analyst at RBC
Capital Markets, said by e-mail.  About 40 percent of Pennon’s operations are in waste
management. The largest publicly traded water companies in the
U.K. are United Utilities Plc and  Severn Trent Plc. (SVT)   To contact the reporter on this story:
