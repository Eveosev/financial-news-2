Malkin Holdings LLC, the supervisor
of the Empire State Building, said it has received about 94
percent of votes needed from the propertyâ€™s investors to include
the tower in a real estate investment trust and take it public.  About 75 percent of unitholders of Empire State Building
Associates LLC, which owns the skyscraper, have voted in favor
of the transaction, Malkin Holdings said in a regulatory filing
today. It needs 80 percent approval from the group to proceed.
As of yesterday, about 87 percent of the unitholders had voted.  Malkin Holdings Chairman  Peter Malkin  and President Anthony Malkin have been urging quick approval of a plan to form a REIT
owning the landmark Manhattan tower and about 20 other New York-
area properties, saying a longer process would be more costly,
and at greater risk of disruption. A group of Empire State
Building Associates beneficiaries have opposed the move and
urged investors not to support the proposal.  The Malkins said March 15 that the plan had been approved
by about 90 percent of unitholders who had voted, with about
two-thirds accounted for. They agreed the following week to
extend voting from a previous deadline of March 25, pending a
court decision on a class-action settlement tied to the
transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
