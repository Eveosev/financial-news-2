Magnum Hunter Resources Corp. (MHR) , the
Houston-based oil and natural gas producer with operations in
 West Virginia ,  North Dakota  and Saskatchewan, advanced the most
in more than four months after it agreed to sell Texas assets
for double the amount invested in them.  Magnum Hunter rose 5.6 percent to $4.02 at 11:10 a.m. in
New York after earlier gaining 12 percent, the most intraday
since Nov. 19. The shares have fallen 38 percent in the last
year.  Magnum Hunter sold mineral leases on 19,000 net acres in
the Eagle Ford Shale for $401 million in cash, including
production equivalent to about 3,000 barrels of oil a day to
Penn Virgina Corp., according to statements today by the
companies. The deal is expected to close in mid May.  Penn  Virginia , based in Radnor, Pennsylvania, fell 0.3
percent today. The company also announced it will sell $400
million of senior notes due 2020 to finance the purchase, which
will increase its Eagle Ford holdings to about 54,000 net acres.  The sale price was double the capital invested in the
leases during the past three years, Magnum Hunter Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Gary C. Evans said in the companyâ€™s
statement today. The company is keeping 7,000 net acres in the
Eagle Ford deposit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
