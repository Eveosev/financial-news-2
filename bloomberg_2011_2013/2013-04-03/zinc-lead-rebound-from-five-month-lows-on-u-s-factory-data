Zinc and lead climbed from the
lowest levels in five months on optimism the U.S. economy is
strengthening, boosting demand for industrial metals. Copper was
little changed as inventories rose.  The three-month zinc contract rose as much as 0.8 percent
to $1,869 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange by 11:03 a.m.
in  Tokyo  after touching $1,850 yesterday, the lowest price since
Nov. 5. Lead rallied 0.6 percent to $2,063 a ton after touching
$2,049.85 yesterday, the lowest since Oct. 31.  Orders placed with U.S. factories rose the most in five
months in February, boosted by a pickup in demand for motor
vehicles and commercial aircraft, a Commerce Department report
showed yesterday. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index reached a
record high yesterday as concern over  Europe ’s debt crisis eased
and U.S. factory orders topped forecasts.  “The U.S. factory data helped metals to rebound as they
were oversold,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at  Korea
Exchange Bank (004940)  Futures Co. in  Seoul . “Support also came from
expectations that the market is bracing for a peak season for
demand and funds will flock into metals, with the start of the
new quarter.”  Zinc’s 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of whether a
commodity is overbought or oversold, has been below the level of
30 on since March 28, indicating a potential impending rebound
to some analysts who study technical charts. Lead’s 14-day
relative strength index has been below the 30 level since March
26.  On the LME, copper was little changed at $7,471.75 a ton
after touching $7,439 yesterday, the lowest price since Aug. 21.
Copper futures for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to $3.3735 a
pound on the Comex in New York. The contract for July delivery
on the Shanghai exchange was little changed at 54,440  yuan 
($8,778) a ton.  Copper  inventories  tracked by the LME climbed 0.2 percent
to 571,125 tons. Orders to remove copper from warehouses surged
28 percent to 116,625 tons, the highest since February 2004, on
bookings in New Orleans.  Aluminum was also little changed on the LME, while nickel
and tin dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
