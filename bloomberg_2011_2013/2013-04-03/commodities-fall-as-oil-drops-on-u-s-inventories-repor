Commodities fell to the lowest level
in more than three months as crude dropped after data showed
U.S. oil stockpiles climbed to a 22-year high.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
declined 2 percent to 638.67, the lowest close since Dec. 24.  Crude and gasoline led the slide after the Energy
Information Administration said oil supplies rose 2.71 million
barrels to 388.6 million last week, the highest level since
1990. Commodities also fell as U.S. reports indicated the
economy is starting to cool.  “Fundamentals have been bearish for crude,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist at commodities trading firm
Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “We have some economic reports that
are pretty disappointing.”  West  Texas  Intermediate oil for May delivery fell $2.74, or
2.8 percent, to $94.45 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since March 22. Futures dropped
the most since Nov. 20.  Brent crude  for May settlement declined $3.58, or 3.2
percent, to end the session at $107.11 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest settlement
since Dec. 7 and the biggest decline since Nov. 7.  Gasoline fell 12.68 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $2.914 a
gallon on the Nymex, the lowest settlement since Feb. 27.  Crude production  was unchanged near the highest level since
1992, the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm,
reported. Output has surged as the combination of horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked
supplies trapped in shale formations in states including  North
Dakota , Texas and Oklahoma.  Job Growth  Commodities also slid as U.S. service industries expanded
in March at the slowest pace in seven months and companies added
fewer workers than forecast.  The  Institute for Supply Management  said its non-
manufacturing  gauge  declined to 54.4 from a one-year high of 56.
Private employment rose 158,000 last month, the smallest gain
since October, according to the ADP Research Institute.  In other commodities, wheat surged on concern that frost is
hurting winter crops in the Great Plains and wet, cold weather
will delay spring planting in  North America .  Wheat futures for delivery in May jumped 3.8 percent to
$6.965 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery rose 2.4 percent to
$1.3945 a pound on ICE, the biggest gain since Jan. 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:
