India ’s benchmark bonds due 2022
advanced on speculation yields near the highest level in three
months will attract investors.  The rate on the notes rose nine basis points last month,
the biggest increase since April 2012, after the government set
a record debt-sales target of 6.29 trillion rupees ($116
billion) for the fiscal year that began this week. The increase
in yields was probably due to the central bank signaling last
month that it has limited room to ease policy and the prospect
of bigger bond supplies, according to Barclays Plc.  “We think both concerns are overdone,” analysts at
Barclays, including Singapore-based  Igor Arsenin , wrote in a
research note today. “As such, we think current bond yields are
pricing in excessive cautiousness, and we see the recent sell-
off as an opportunity to buy.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.97 percent as of
10:18 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. Yesterday’s level of 7.99 percent was the highest since
Jan. 2. Barclays predicts the yield will decline to 7.40 percent
by September.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.46 percent, the lowest level since April 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
