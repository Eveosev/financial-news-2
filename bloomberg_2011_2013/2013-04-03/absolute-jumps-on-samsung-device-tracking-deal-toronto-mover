Absolute Software Corp. (ABT)  surged the
most in more than four years after  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) 
agreed to install its theft deterrents for mobile phones.  Absolute jumped 16 percent to C$6.39 at the close in
Toronto, the most since November 2008. The company has a market
value of C$265 million ($261 million).  Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker, plans to
incorporate Absolute’s technology into its line of Galaxy
devices later this year, the Vancouver-based company said today.
 Absolute software  helps users trace their smartphones and
tablets remotely wherever they are.  “This deal in our view makes Absolute a much more credible
competitor in the mobile device management space,” said Thanos Moschopoulos, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who upgraded the
stock to the equivalent of a buy on the news. “This also makes
Absolute all the more attractive as a potential acquisition
candidate.”  Absolute was founded in 1993 to help users track their
laptops. As sales growth of those devices slows, the company is
harnessing its future to booming sales of tablets and
smartphones, a market led by Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung.
Google Inc.’s Android platform, used by Samsung, accounted for
70 percent of all smartphones sold in the fourth quarter of
2012, according to IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
