China’s  yuan  retreated from a 19-
year high after the central bank weakened the currency’s
 reference rate .  The People’s Bank of China lowered the daily  fixing  by 0.04
percent to 6.2609 per dollar today as policy makers said the
global economic outlook remains “complicated.” The yuan is
allowed to trade 1 percent on either side of the reference rate.
An official  non-manufacturing   Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose to
55.6 in March from 54.5 in February, while the HSBC China
Services PMI indicated the fastest expansion in six months,
reports showed today.  The yuan fell 0.04 percent to close at 6.2010 per dollar in
 Shanghai , prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System
show. The currency rose 0.15 percent to 6.1986 yesterday, the
biggest gain since Dec. 13 and the strongest level since the
government unified official and market exchange rates at the end
of 1993.  “China data is signaling the economy is still in the early
stage of a rebound,” said Sim Moh Siong, a strategist at Bank
of  Singapore . “The PBOC is under no pressure to go for faster
yuan appreciation, especially with concerns surrounding the
Europe and U.S. economies.”  Reports this week showed  manufacturing  in the U.S. grew
slower than economists predicted for March, and unemployment in
the 17-nation euro-area held at a record-high 12 percent in
February.  ‘Basically’ Stable  The central bank will keep the yuan “basically” stable,
adopt prudent monetary policy and guide steady money and credit
growth, according to a  statement  on its website. While the
global economy is recovering, the condition remains complicated,
it said without elaborating.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the Chinese currency traded
at 6.1955 per dollar versus 6.1960 yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.07
percent to 6.2840, a 1.3 percent discount to the spot rate in
Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
