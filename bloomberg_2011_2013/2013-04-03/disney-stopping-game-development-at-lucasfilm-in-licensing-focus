Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  is halting video-
game development at its recently acquired Lucasfilm division in
an effort to cut costs.  Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company, will
focus on licensing “Star Wars” content rather than developing
games internally, Miles Perkins, a Lucasfilm spokesman, said.  Disney  acquired  Lucasfilm, the business founded by director
George Lucas last year for about $4 billion. LucasArts, the
company’s video-game unit, was established in 1982 and its
catalog has included titles such as “Lego Star Wars” and
“Star Wars Battlefront,” according to its  website .  Moving from internal development to licensing is designed
to minimize “risk while achieving a broader portfolio of
quality Star Wars games,” the company said in a statement. “As
a result of this change, we’ve had layoffs across the
organization,” according to the statement.  Perkins declined to say how many Lucasfilm jobs will be
affected. The company employs more than 1,800 people in San
Francisco and other locations, he said. Lucasfilm is looking for
external partners to complete games currently in development
such as “Star Wars 1313,” he said.  Disney, based in  Burbank ,  California , fell less than 1
percent to $57.25 at the close in New York. The shares are up 15
percent this year.  The decision was  reported  earlier by the website
GameInformer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
