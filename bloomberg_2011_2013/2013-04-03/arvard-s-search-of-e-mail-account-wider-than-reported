Harvard University ’s search of a
resident dean’s e-mail for leaks to the media was wider than the
school originally said.  Last month, Harvard said it had searched administrative e-
mail accounts of 16 resident deans, who sit on a board that
probes student infractions, to see who had forwarded a
confidential e-mail cited by the  Crimson  student newspaper.
Evelynn Hammonds, dean of  Harvard College , told a faculty
meeting today that officials searched both the administrative
account and the individual account of one of the deans.  In September, Harvard began investigating dozens of
students for possible cheating on a take-home final exam.
Harvard’s probe of the leak showed that one resident dean
forwarded an e-mail to two students seeking advice about how
best to respond to the cheating investigation. While the
resident dean wasn’t disciplined, professors were angered by the
school’s probe of faculty communications.  The Boston Globe reported the news earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
