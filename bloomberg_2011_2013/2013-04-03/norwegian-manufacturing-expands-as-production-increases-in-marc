Norwegian manufacturing contracted
last month as production slumped.  Norway ’s  purchasing managers’ index  fell to 48.9 from a
revised 50 in March,  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  said. Readings below 50
signal a contraction. The index was seen falling to 49.8 in a
Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Norges Bank in March left its benchmark rate unchanged at
1.5 percent and signaled a potential rate cut this year as krone
strength has cooled growth and inflation in  Europe ’s second-
richest nation.  The production sub-index fell to 47.5 from 50.4, while the
order index increased to 47.7 from 47.6. The employment index
fell to 51.5.  Growth in Norway’s mainland economy, which excludes oil,
gas and shipping, is estimated to slow to 2.75 percent in 2013
from 3.5 percent last year, according to central bank forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
