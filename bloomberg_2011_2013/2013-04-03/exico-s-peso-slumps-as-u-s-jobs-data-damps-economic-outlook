Mexico ’s peso weakened as U.S.
companies added fewer jobs than forecast last month, damping the
economic outlook for the Latin American country’s biggest
trading partner.  The peso slumped 0.1 percent to 12.2841 per  U.S. dollar  at
7:24 a.m. in Mexico City, paring gains this year to 4.6 percent,
still the biggest rally against the greenback among the world’s
16 most-traded currencies.  The peso’s advance this year, including a 0.7 percent jump
yesterday, has been partly fueled by stronger growth in the
U.S., the destination for about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.
The 158,000 increase in employment last month was the smallest
since October, figures from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Research Institute showed today. The median forecast of 39
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increase of
200,000.  “It’s sort of the combination of a good couple of
sessions” and “a bad ADP number that sort of signals or
indicates that the non-farm payrolls aren’t going to be as
good,”   Benito Berber , a Latin America strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc., said in a telephone interview from  New York .
“Both things sort of put pressure on the Mexican peso.”  Yields on peso-denominated bonds due in 2024 were little
changed at 5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price fell 0.03 centavo to 144.20 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
