Thailand’s baht,  Asia ’s best-
performing currency this year, fell to a two-week low on
speculation slowing inflation will make the central bank more
inclined to curb appreciation that threatens exports.  The baht fell 0.3 percent to 29.46 per dollar as of 9:13
a.m. in Bangkok and touched 29.48, the weakest level since March
19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has rallied 3.8
percent this year and touched 29.08 on March 20, the strongest
level since 1997. Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn
Trairatvorakul said that day the currency was rising too
quickly, while Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said a day
later that he wanted the baht to weaken.  Consumer prices  rose 2.69 percent in March, the least since
August, official data showed this week. Currency gains help
contain inflation by reducing the costs of imports in local-
currency terms.  “With easing inflation for now, it is possible the central
bank will be concerned more about the appreciation in the short
term,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency strategist at Daiwa
Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “But price pressure will continue in
the long term and they will probably have to allow for some more
appreciation later.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.18 percent.  Government bonds  were little changed before a central bank
policy meeting today at which the  one-day bond repurchase rate 
is expected to be kept at 2.75 percent, according to 20 of 21
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One forecast a reduction of a
quarter of a percentage point. The decision is due around 2:30
p.m. in Bangkok. The monetary authority has held the rate steady
since October, when it cut from 3 percent.  The yield on  Thailand ’s 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023
was 3.53 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
has averaged 3.63 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
