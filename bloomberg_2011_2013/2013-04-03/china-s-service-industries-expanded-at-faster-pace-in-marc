China ’s  service industries  expanded
at a faster pace last month, supporting a further acceleration
of growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.  The  non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index  rose to
55.6 from 54.5 in February, the Beijing-based National  Bureau of
Statistics  and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
in a statement today. A separate services gauge from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics rose to 54.3, matching the
highest since May, from 52.1. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  A pickup in industries from banking to transportation would
bolster expansion after factory output had the weakest January-
February growth since 2009. Premier  Li Keqiang , who took office
last month, is trying to rely more on domestic demand for growth
and less on exports and investment.  “The economy is on track to meet or beat the government’s
target,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist and strategist at
Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong , said in a note. The official
gauge’s level, while “relatively low” by historical standards,
is consistent with a “more moderate pace of growth,” Kowalczyk
said.  The government last month set a target of 7.5 percent
expansion for 2013, the same as 2012’s goal. The March reading
of the official services PMI compares with 58.0 in March 2012
and 59.2 in March 2011.  The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index of stocks rose 0.2
percent as of 9:52 a.m. local time following two days of losses.  Growth Pickup  Economic growth may have accelerated for a second quarter
to 8.1 percent in the first three months of this year, according
to the median estimate in a  Bloomberg News  survey last month.
Gross domestic product  expanded  7.9 percent in the final three
months of last year after a 7.4 percent gain in the previous
quarter, reversing a seven-quarter slowdown.  The official report “reflects growing momentum” in
expansion, Cai Jin, a vice chairman at the federation, said in a
statement. A construction index rose to the highest in a year,
while a logistics gauge “increased significantly,” Cai said.  The logistics federation’s non-manufacturing index is based
on responses from purchasing managers at 1,200 companies in 27
industries including banking, retailing, construction and
transportation. A new seasonally adjusted series began in March
2012 and the data were revised back to March 2011.  China’s official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for
manufacturing rose to an 11-month-high of 50.9 in March, the
statistics agency said on April 1. That was below the 51.2
median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. A
similar gauge from HSBC and Markit rose to 51.6 from 50.4.
Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  Increase Share  Service industries accounted for 45 percent of gross
domestic product last year, according to the statistics bureau,
up from 41 percent in 2003. The government is seeking to
increase the share to 47 percent by 2015. In the U.S., services
comprise 90 percent of the economy.  Treasury Wine Estates Ltd., (TWE)  the world’s second-largest wine
company, expects China to overtake the U.S. by 2023 as the
biggest wine market globally, Chief Executive Officer David Dearie, said in an interview in Beijing on March 22. Dearie said
Chinese wine sales will rise to about 500 million cases a year
in a decade, from 150 million cases at present.  --Zhou Xin. With assistance from Ailing Tan in  Singapore .
