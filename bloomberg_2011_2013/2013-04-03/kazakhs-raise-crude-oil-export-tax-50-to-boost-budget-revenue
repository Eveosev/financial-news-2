Kazakhstan  raised its oil export tax
by 50 percent to $60 a metric ton ($8.19 a barrel), effective
from April 13 as the Central Asian state seeks a larger share of
revenue from sales of crude.  Kazakhstan announced the increase today in a  decree 
published in the official government newspaper, Kazakhstanskaya
Pravda.  Central Asia’s biggest oil producer began taxing crude
exports in May 2008 to raise cash as global credit markets
tightened. The duty, cut to zero in January 2009, was raised to
$20 a ton in August 2010, and then to $40 in January 2011.
Kazakhstan is raising revenue after industrial production growth
slowed in 2012 to 0.5 percent from a year earlier, trailing the
government’s forecast of 2.7 percent.  The nation doesn’t plan to raise the tax further this year,
Deputy Economy and Budget Planning Minister Marat Kusainov said
today in Astana, according to Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
