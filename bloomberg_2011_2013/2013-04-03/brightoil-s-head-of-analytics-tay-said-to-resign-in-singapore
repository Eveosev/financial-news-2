Tay Guan Leng resigned as the head
of analytics at  Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. (933)  in Singapore,
according to two people with knowledge of the departure.  Tay, 41, stepped down early last week, said the people who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
He formerly worked for  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Singapore office before joining
Brightoil, said the people. They didn’t say where Tay was
moving.  Quek Chin Thean, former chief executive officer of
Brightoil’s Singapore unit, resigned in November and joined
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as head of Asia-Pacific commodity
trading last month.  Ella Mak, the Hong Kong-based spokeswoman of Brightoil,
didn’t reply to four calls to her office and mobile phone.
Brightoil was the third-largest shipping fuel supplier last year
in Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering port, according to
the city-state’s Maritime and Port Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
