Cocoa trimmed declines in  New York 
after falling below the 50-day moving average. Sugar fell.  Cocoa fell as much as 1.4 percent to $2,140 a metric ton,
below the 50-day moving average of about $2,153 a ton, on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The European Cocoa Association said on
its website yesterday its first-quarter report on European cocoa
grindings, a sign of demand, is due April 17.  “New York just went below the 50-day average and may be
resulting in technical selling,” Keith Flury, an analyst at
Rabobank International in London, said by e-mail today. “The
market will likely stay in this range until the grinding data
starts coming out.”  Cocoa for May delivery dropped 1.1 percent to $2,149 a ton
by 7:38 a.m. in New York on ICE Futures. Selling on NYSE Liffe
in  London  may have been triggered after prices failed to close
above the 100-day moving average yesterday, Flury said. Prices
in London were down 0.8 percent.  Cocoa demand will probably strengthen this year, helping
push prices in New York to $2,400 a ton by the fourth quarter,
Commerzbank AG said in a report today.  Raw sugar futures dropped 0.1 percent to 17.58 cents a
pound and arabica coffee climbed 0.2 percent to $1.3635 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
