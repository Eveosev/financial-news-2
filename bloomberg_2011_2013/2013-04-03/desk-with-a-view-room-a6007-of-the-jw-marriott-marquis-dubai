Room A6007,  JW Marriott Marquis , Dubai, on the 60th floor of the world's tallest building used solely as a hotel. My own boasting rights about staying in the world's tallest hotel were deflated somewhat when a dinner companion used a smartphone to Google "world's tallest hotel room," informing me that, at the moment, the record goes to a suite on the 117th floor of the  Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong , a building that tops out at 1,588 feet. But since the Ritz occupies only some of the floors of a mixed-use skyscraper, the JW Marriott Marquis in Dubai can chalk up a victory on a technicality. At 1,164 feet, the 72-floor complex (actually connected twin towers) stands 85 feet shy of the  Empire State Building  and sits down the road from the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa (2,717 feet). Even beyond my dinner table, the skyscraper war between the Arab Gulf states and Asia has been escalating: Saudi Arabia is planning a kilometer-high tower for Riyadh (3,281feet), and China has announced a project to build the 2,749-foot "Sky City" in Changsha, a city in Hunan Province—in just 90 days.
