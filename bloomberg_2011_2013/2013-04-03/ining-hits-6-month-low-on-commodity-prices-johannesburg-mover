South Africa ’s mining index,
accounting for 24 percent of the country’s stock market
weighting, declined to its lowest in almost seven months as
commodity prices fall on weak demand prospects.  The  19-member FTSE/JSE Africa Mining Index (JMNNG)  retreated as
much as 2.2 percent and traded 1.8 percent weaker at 29,103.90
by 1:48 p.m. in Johannesburg, the lowest intraday level since
Sept. 6.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL) , with a 47 percent weighting in the
mining gauge, led the decline, falling 1.2 percent to 266.78
rand, set for its lowest since Nov. 16.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  lost
as much as 2.4 percent to its lowest intraday level since
October 2009.  Africa’s biggest economy and host to the world’s highest
platinum reserves in the Rustenburg region is facing low demand
from emerging countries, labor unrest and higher energy costs.
Commodity prices retreated. The spot gold price fell for a
second day, retreating 0.3 percent to $1,571.22 an ounce, the
lowest intraday level since March 8. Platinum retreated 0.2
percent to $1,569.16 an ounce.  “Gold, platinum and copper prices are down and that will
lead to weaknesses on mining equity prices without a doubt,”
Brandon Sacks, a trader at Johannesburg-based Avior Research Pty
Ltd., said in a phone interview. “I am not convinced that there
will be higher demand from big consumer countries like  China 
until next year.”  Today’s fall in the mining gauge drove the 166-member
FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index to its biggest decline in a
week. On a closing basis, the main measure is set for the lowest
since Feb. 27, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
