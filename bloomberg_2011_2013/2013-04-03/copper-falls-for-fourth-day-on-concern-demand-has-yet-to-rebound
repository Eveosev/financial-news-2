Copper, trading at the lowest price
since August in  London , fell for a fourth day on concern demand
shows few signs of reviving as stockpiles of the metal swell.  Figures today will show U.S. service industries, ranging
from housing to retailing, expanded at a slower pace last month,
economists surveyed by Bloomberg said. Manufacturing in the euro
zone shrank for a 20th month, according to a report yesterday.
Copper inventories monitored by the London Metal Exchange are
the highest since October 2003.  “Base metals are telling a story about global growth which
is not reflected in U.S. equity markets, for example,” Guy Wolf, a macro strategist at Marex Spectron Group in London, said
by e-mail. “There is limited physical demand and no shortage of
supply. The rise in LME stocks is simply a reflection of this.”  Copper for delivery in three months declined 0.3 percent to
$7,443 a metric ton by 10:59 a.m. on the LME. Prices reached
$7,404.50, the lowest since Aug. 20. Copper for delivery in May
fell 0.5 percent to $3.3625 a pound on the Comex in New York.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of U.S. shares closed at a
record high yesterday and is up 10 percent this year, while the
LME Index of the six main industrial metals traded in London has
dropped 6.8 percent in 2013. The Institute for Supply
Management’s U.S. services index will come in at 55.5 for March,
down from 56 in the prior month, the survey showed.  Copper  inventories  tracked by the LME rose for a 33rd
session to 572,325 tons, daily exchange figures showed. Stocks
monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell to 241,943 tons
this week, according to figures today. The Chinese market will
be shut tomorrow and April 5 for national holidays.  Orders to remove copper from LME warehouses increased 3.7
percent to 120,975 tons. They jumped 87 percent in the past week
to the highest since February 2004.  Zinc advanced in London after reaching this year’s lowest
price yesterday and lead gained from today’s 2013 low. Tin,
nickel and aluminum dropped.  “The selloff is now overdone,” Jesper Dannesboe, an
analyst at Societe Generale SA in London, said by e-mail of
metals. Dannesboe said he “wouldn’t be surprised to see higher
prices soon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
