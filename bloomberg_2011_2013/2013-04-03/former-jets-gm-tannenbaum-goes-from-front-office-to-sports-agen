Former New York Jets General Manager
Mike Tannenbaum joined Priority Sports as head of the
representation firm’s newly created coaches, front office and
broadcasting division.  Tannenbaum will start immediately and be based in New York,
according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm, whose
chief executive officer is agent Mark Bartelstein.  Tannenbaum was fired in December after the Jets finished 6-
10, last in their division after the acquisition of quarterback
Tim Tebow didn’t pan out. He had been the team’s general manager
since 2006 after joining the Jets as assistant GM in 2001. The
Jets reached the playoffs three times and never won a division
title in Tannenbaum’s tenure overseeing personnel. Their
regular-season record was 57-55 during that span.  “It’s a tremendous company with no shortage of talented
people and I only hope to add to the firm’s sterling reputation
throughout the industry,” Tannenbaum said in the statement.  Bartelstein’s clients include David Lee of the Golden State
Warriors and Steve Novak of the New York Knicks in the National
Basketball Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
