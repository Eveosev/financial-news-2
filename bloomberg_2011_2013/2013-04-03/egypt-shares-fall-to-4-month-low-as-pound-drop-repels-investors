Egypt ’s  benchmark stock index 
tumbled to the lowest level in almost four months on investor
concern the weakening local currency will diminish the value of
their holdings.  All shares on the  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  declined, pushing the
measure down 2.2 percent to 4,926.22 at the close in Cairo, the
weakest level since Dec. 6. The gauge has tumbled 9.8 percent
this year, the sixth-worst performer among 93 indexes tracked by
Bloomberg.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI)  fell to an
eight-month low.  EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)  decreased after
reporting a fourth-quarter loss.  Assets denominated in Egyptian pounds have lost value this
year after the local currency depreciated 6.6 percent in 2013 to
6.8178 a dollar at 3:24 p.m. in Cairo, according to Bank of
Alexandria prices. A dollar shortage spurred the creation of an
unregulated market, where buyers pay a premium of as much as 17
percent to the official rate, three money exchangers said,
asking not to be identified because the trade is illegal.  “The sharp movement of the dollar in the parallel market
reinforces the fragility of economic situation of the country,”
 Wael Ziada , Cairo-based head of research at EFG-Hermes, said by
phone. “Investors can see it’s eroding the value of stocks in
dollar terms.”  The pound depreciated to 7.85 a dollar yesterday from 7.65
a dollar in unofficial trading, according to the average of
three quotes from the dealers.  ‘Sinking In’  The central bank started limiting access to the U.S.
currency on Dec. 30, when it introduced dollar auctions aimed at
stemming the depletion of  foreign reserves , which plunged more
than 60 percent in two years. The regulator auctioned $462
million in March, down 11 percent from the previous month and
about half the amount sold in January, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock market slump “shows sentiment has turned and
economic realities are sinking in,” Ziada said.  EFG-Hermes retreated 2.1 percent to 9.49 pounds, the lowest
level since June. The investment bank reported a fourth-quarter
loss of 21 million pounds ($3.1 million) compared with a 31
million-pound profit a year earlier, as expenses rose faster
than revenue. Commercial International, the country’s biggest
publicly traded lender, fell 4.8 percent to 27.35 pounds.  Daily  trading volume  was 107 million shares, compared with
a 12-month daily average of 128 million shares, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
