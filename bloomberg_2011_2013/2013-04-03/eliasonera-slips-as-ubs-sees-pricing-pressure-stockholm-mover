TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  fell the most in two
months in Stockholm trading after UBS AG advised clients to sell
the shares and lowered its earnings forecasts for the company
because of increasing competition in its main markets.  TeliaSonera fell as much as  2.1 percent  to 45.86 kronor,
the steepest intraday drop since Feb. 4, and was trading down
0.7 percent at 10:18 a.m. local time, giving the company a
market value of 202 billion kronor ($31 billion). Volumes were
55 percent of the daily average in the past three months.  UBS cut its rating on TeliaSonera to sell from neutral and
lowered its 12-month share price estimate to 38 kronor from 43
kronor. It also added TeliaSonera to its least preferred list
among European telephone companies, after cutting its revenue
and earnings forecasts by 2 percent to 3 percent because of
higher price competition in Sweden, Finland and Kazakhstan.  “We expect Swedish mobile revenue to turn negative in 2013
driven by discounting, on-going tariff spin-down and
regulation,” Andy Parnis and Nick Lyall, analysts at UBS in
London, wrote in a note to clients today.  Corporate governance uncertainty “is likely to weigh on
the stock given the change in CEO and other issues,” Parnis and
Lyall said. UBS expects TeliaSonera’s “23-35 percent valuation
premium to narrow significantly now, given that long-term growth
forecasts are flat to negative,” the analysts said.  TeliaSonera Chief Executive Officer Lars Nyberg resigned on
Feb. 1 after a law firm hired to investigate graft accusations
said TeliaSonera should have been more careful when it bought an
Uzbeki phone license in 2007. The company’s Chairman Anders Narvinger is also leaving the TeliaSonera board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
