Fan Milk Ltd. (FML) , a maker of food and
drinks in  Ghana , headed for the highest on record after saying
it will pay a 50 percent higher dividend for 2012 than a year
earlier.  The stock gained 0.4 percent to 5.47 cedis by 2 p.m. in the
capital, Accra. At close at that level would be the highest
since at least April 1995, when Bloomberg began compiling the
data.  Fan Milk will pay 0.06 cedi a share for the year on June
14, it said in a stock exchange statement yesterday. That
compares with the 0.04 cedi dividend for 2011.  “Investors want to own shares before the ex-dividend
date” of April 17, Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Ecobank
Development Corp., said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
