Members of  South Africa ’s Food and
Allied Workers Union staged a march today and asked the
country’s Trade and Industry Ministry to impose tariffs on
chicken imports from the European Union and  Brazil .  About 400 people participated in the march in  Pretoria , the
capital, to hand in a memorandum about the fees, Katishi
Masemola, the union’s general secretary, said by phone.  “The point we are making is for more, faster action to be
taken,” Masemola said. “We are creating more of a sense of
urgency. Our industry is threatened.”  South Africa imposed additional anti-dumping duties of 6
percent to 63 percent from February to August last year on some
chicken cuts imported from Brazil. The Latin American country
filed a complaint with the  World Trade Organization .  Trade Minister  Rob Davies  in December decided not to impose
anti-dumping duties on whole birds and boneless cuts from Brazil
and instead said there was scope to raise general tariffs for
shipments, Business Day reported on Dec. 27.  The South African Poultry Association has applied to the
country’s International Trade Administration Commission to
impose a general tariff and has asked for anti-dumping
protection from EU shipments under World Trade Organisation
rules, the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported today, citing
the association’s chief executive officer, Kevin Lovell.  Industry stakeholders met about three weeks ago and will
follow up soon, Masemola said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
