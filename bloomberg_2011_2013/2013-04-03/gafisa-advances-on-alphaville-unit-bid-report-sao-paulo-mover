Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  rose the most in five
weeks after newspaper  Valor Economico  reported that the
homebuilder received offers for a unit that amounted to the
company’s total market value.  Shares rose 6.9 percent to 4.01 reais at 1:24 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo  after earlier advancing as much as 8.3 percent in the
biggest intraday gain since Feb. 22. The company was the best
performer on the Bovespa index, which added 0.7 percent.  Gafisa has received four offers to acquire its Alphaville
Urbanismo subsidiary that valued the unit as high as 1.9 billion
reais ($940 million), according to Valor, which didn’t say where
it got the information. Gafisa’s market capitalization was 1.6
billion reais yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Alphaville builds expensive houses and apartments.  The Sao Paulo-based homebuilder declined to comment when
contacted by  Bloomberg News . Gafisa had said in a regulatory
filing on September that it is considering strategic options
regarding Alphaville, including an initial public offering. The
unit was registered as a public company on March 28.  The homebuilder’s shares declined 20 percent this year
through yesterday while the Bovespa slid 10 percent during that
same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
