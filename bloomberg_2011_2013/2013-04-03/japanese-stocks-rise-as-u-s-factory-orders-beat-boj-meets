     April 3 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  capping the biggest rally in eight
weeks, after demand for motor vehicles boosted U.S. factory
orders and the Bank of  Japan  started a policy meeting.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets 44 percent of its revenue in
 North America , rose 4.6 percent.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , the
utility at the center of the 2011 nuclear crisis, soared 24
percent on a report it will save money by switching to coal-
fired power plants.  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , Asian’s biggest apparel
chain, jumped 11 percent after saying same-store sales at its
Uniqlo Japan outlets surged 14 percent in March from a year
earlier.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 3 percent to close at
12,362.20 in  Tokyo , the biggest gain since Feb. 6. The Topix
Index advanced 1.9 percent to 1,010.43 after slumping 4.2
percent over the past two days. About eight stocks gained for
each that fell on the gauge.  “The BOJ will have to show progress toward its inflation
target in order to achieve it in the long term,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest bank by market
value. “In the U.S., growth-sensitive sectors like cars and
housing are finally showing improvement.”  The Nikkei 225 rallied 43 percent from Nov. 14, when
Japanese elections were announced, amid optimism new Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s government and the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will take
more steps to beat deflation. The  gauge  traded at 18.9 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 14.2 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  BOJ Meeting  The BOJ will boost monthly bond purchases by about 50
percent to 5.2 trillion yen ($55.6 billion) at a two-day meeting
ending tomorrow, the first after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
took the post, according to the average forecast in a survey of
economists by  Bloomberg News .  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPX)  were little changed. The measure
climbed 0.5 percent yesterday after the Commerce Department
report showed a 3 percent gain in factory orders, citing a
pickup in demand for motor vehicles and commercial aircraft. The
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a
2.9 percent increase.  ‘Improving Steadily’  “The  U.S. economy  is improving steadily,”  said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc. “The new BOJ leadership will probably continue bold
monetary easing in the long term and keep expectations high,
communicating well with the market.”  Carmakers advanced. Honda added 4.6 percent to 3,525 yen.
 Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , which gets 28 percent of its sales in North
America, gained 6.5 percent to 279 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s biggest carmaker, rose 3.8 percent to 4,790 yen.  Tokyo Electric  soared 24 percent to 313 yen as it may save
175 billion yen per year by switching to coal-fired power
plants,  Kyodo News  reported. The stock surged the most since
Dec. 17, leading gains on the Nikkei 225.  Fast Retailing, the most heavily- weighted stock on the
Nikkei 225, jumped 14 percent to 35,650 yen after saying warmer
weather and an extra Sunday in March fueled the biggest monthly
sales jump in more than three years.  Among stocks that fell,  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal
Corp. (5401) , Japan’s biggest steelmaker by market value, and  JFE
Holdings Inc. (5411) , the second biggest, dropped after their ratings
were cut to neutral from outperform at Credit Suisse Group AG.
Nippon Steel lost 2.7 percent to 216 yen and JFE declined 2.8
percent 1,646 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  dropped 2.3
percent to 27.08 today, indicating traders expect a swing of
about 7.8 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.
Trading volume on the Nikkei 225 was 8.9 percent above the 30-
day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
