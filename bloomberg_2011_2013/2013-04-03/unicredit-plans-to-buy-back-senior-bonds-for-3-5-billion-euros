UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest bank,
is offering to buy back senior bonds for as much as 3.5 billion
euros ($4.5 billion) to cut borrowings and adjust the maturities
on its debt.  The offer will run from April 8 through April 24, the
Milan-based lender said in a statement today. The bank is
offering to buy back part of 17 securities that total 13 billion
euros, reducing the amount UniCredit would need to pay back in
2015 through 2017.  UniCredit expects lower net interest income this year as
loan demand weakens and funding costs increase, the bank said on
March 15. Chief Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  is
reorganizing the lender to improve profitability as Italy’s
longest economic slump in 20 years and tougher industry rules
force higher provisions.  The bank will set the purchase prices by 9:30 a.m. on the
first day of the offer, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
