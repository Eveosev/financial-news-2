The number of gasoline cargoes
booked on tankers for shipment to the U.S. will expand in the
next two weeks, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Traders will charter a total of 34 Medium Range vessels for
loading within the 14 days to April 16, according to the median
in the survey yesterday of five shipbrokers and traders
specializing in shipments of the auto fuel. That compares with
20 ships in the corresponding survey last week.  U.S. gasoline demand rose in the second quarter of every
year since at least 1998, Energy Department data show. The
nation’s consumption of the fuel normally peaks during the so-
called driving season from the Memorial Day holiday in late May
to Labor Day in early September.  There are 40 ships seeking charters, up from 36 last week,
the survey showed. Of the 34 shipments, which are normally about
37,000 metric tons each, 16 are anticipated and the rest have
been arranged, according to the respondents.  The survey is based on the industry’s benchmark Rotterdam-
to-New York trade route. The voyage takes about 11 days at 12.5
knots, according to the sea-distances.com website.  *T                              April 2      March 26    Change
