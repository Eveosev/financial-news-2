Brooksley Born, whose effort to
regulate over-the-counter derivatives was thwarted when she
served as a regulator in the 1990s, said a large U.S. bank
failure would require a bailout to avoid disrupting the economy.  “Too big to fail is the primary problem,” said Born,
former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Born, a retired partner of law firm Arnold & Porter LLP in
 Washington , was speaking at a panel discussion in Washington
today held by advocacy group  Public Citizen .  Born’s 1998 proposal to consider regulating OTC derivatives
was opposed by the Clinton administration and eventually
dropped. The OTC market later included the toxic instruments
that contributed to the demise of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
and the 2008 financial crisis.  She also said today that OTC swaps speculation causes asset
bubbles.  The global OTC derivatives market mushroomed to a notional
value of almost $600 trillion in 2007 from about $28 trillion at
the time of Born’s proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
