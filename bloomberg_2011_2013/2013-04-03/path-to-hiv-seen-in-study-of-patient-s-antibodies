Researchers tracking the intricate
struggle between HIV and the human immune system have  uncovered 
information that may be helpful in the 30-year hunt for a
vaccine by monitoring the virus’s progress week by week in a
newly infected patient.  Blood samples from the person were used to monitor the  AIDS 
virus as it mutated to evade immune system antibodies. While HIV
almost always wins that battle, scientists after two years of
testing the man found he was among the 20 percent of patients
who eventually produce “broadly neutralizing antibodies” able
to shut down most forms of HIV.  That allowed them to study the antibodies closely as they
evolved, offering potential approaches to spark their natural
production through a  vaccine , the researchers said. More than
1.2 million people have HIV in the U.S., and 34.2 million are
infected worldwide. While new drugs help to keep the disease in
check, an easy-to-use vaccine for the disease for high-risk
groups would be valuable.  “For the first time, we have mapped not only the
evolutionary pathway of the antibody, but also the evolutionary
pathway of the virus, defining the sequence of events involved
that induce the broadly neutralizing antibodies,” said Barton
Haynes, director of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute at Duke
University in Durham, North Carolina, in a statement.  The study, funded by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, was published in the journal  Nature .  To contact the reporter on this story:
