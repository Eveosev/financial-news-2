Crude tumbled the most in 2013 after
the government reported U.S. oil stockpiles increased to the
highest level in more than 22 years. West  Texas  Intermediate’s
discount to Brent reached a nine-month low.  Futures in New York fell 2.8 percent as the Energy
Information Administration said supplies rose 2.71 million
barrels to 388.6 million last week, the most since 1990. The
report was projected to show an advance of 2.05 million,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Pegasus
pipeline, linking the U.S. Midwest to Texas refineries, will
remain shut until regulators are satisfied with repairs.  “The amount of oil in storage continues to climb and we
haven’t seen these levels in decades,” said Adam Wise, who
helps manage a $6 billion oil and gas bond portfolio as a
managing director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston .
“Prices are reacting to the market fundamentals.”  WTI oil for May delivery fell $2.74 to $94.45 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
March 22. Futures dropped the most since Nov. 20. Trading was 39
percent above the 100-day average at 3:11 p.m.  Brent crude  for May settlement declined $3.58, or 3.2
percent, to end the session at $107.11 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest settlement
since Dec. 7 and the biggest decline since Nov. 7. Trading was
more than double the 100-day average.  The European benchmark grade traded at a $12.66 premium to
WTI, down from $13.50 yesterday and the narrowest spread since
July. The differential reached $23.18 a barrel on Feb. 8, the
widest level this year.  ‘Primary Cause’  “There are a number of causes for the narrowing of the
Brent-WTI spread,” said Marshall Berol, co-portfolio manager of
the Encompass Fund in  San Francisco , which has about $300
million in assets. “The primary reason is that some of the  risk
premium  that was built into the Brent price has dissipated.”  Barclays Plc (BARC)  reduced its projections for both WTI and Brent
prices in 2013 on “what is for now at least a more placid
geopolitical environment than we previously expected,”
according to an e-mailed report today. WTI will average $95 a
barrel in 2013, down from a previous forecast of $108, and Brent
will average $112, down from $125, Miswin Mahesh, an analyst,
said in the report.  Crude production  was unchanged near the highest level since
1992. Output has surged as the combination of horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked
supplies trapped in shale formations in the central U.S.  Cushing Inventories  Crude stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub fell
287,000 barrels to 49.2 million last week, according to the EIA,
the statistical arm of the Energy Department. Cushing
inventories rose to a record 51.9 million in January.  Refineries operated  at 86.3 percent of capacity last week,
the most in two months. Units are often reopened in the spring
after being idled for maintenance in late winter as attention
shifts away from heating oil and before the peak season for
gasoline consumption.  Stockpiles of  gasoline  decreased 572,000 barrels to 220.7
million last week, the lowest level since December, according to
the EIA. Gasoline for May delivery tumbled 12.68 cents, or 4.2
percent, to $2.914 a gallon on the Nymex, the lowest settlement
since Feb. 28.  Exxon’s 96,000-barrel-a-day Pegasus pipeline line was
closed after a leak was discovered in  Arkansas  on March 29. The
line runs from Patoka,  Illinois , to Nederland, Texas, and serves
refineries on the  Gulf Coast .  Action Order  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
issued a corrective action order yesterday, citing  hazards  to
“life, property and the environment” if the pipeline were to
continue operating without corrective measures.  Equities fell and the drop in crude accelerated after U.S.
economic data trailed estimates. The  Institute for Supply
Management ’s service industry  index  fell to 54.4 in March from
56 in February, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said. The  median 
projection in a Bloomberg survey called for a drop to 55.5. An
earlier report showed U.S. companies added fewer jobs than
forecast last month.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1 percent and the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 0.7 percent.  The dollar dropped 0.2 percent against the euro, curbing
the appeal of raw materials denominated in the U.S. currency as
an investment. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24
commodities was down 2 percent at 3:14 p.m.  African Output  Threatened disruptions of supply from two of Africa’s three
biggest crude-producing countries didn’t bolster prices.  The main rebel group in Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger River
delta said it’s resuming attacks after its suspected leader,
 Henry Okah , was imprisoned in  South Africa . The Movement for the
Emancipation of the  Niger Delta  will start to carry out assaults
on April 5, Jomo Gbomo, a spokesman, said in a statement.  An explosion hit Libya’s Zueitina Oil Co.’s crude and
condensate pipelines yesterday at 10 p.m., state-run National
Oil Corp. said on its website, citing Abul Qasim Shanger, a
company official. The company is investigating the incident and
starting repairs, NOC said, without saying whether operations
were disrupted.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was 20.2 percent, up from 17.3 percent yesterday
and the highest level since March 6.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 622,863
contracts as of 3:14 p.m. It totaled 508,715 contracts
yesterday, 10 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was a record 1.73 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
