China ’s benchmark money-market rate
dropped the most in a week on speculation capital inflows will
increase as  yuan  appreciation quickens, boosting cash in the
financial system.  The People’s Bank of China didn’t gauge demand today for
repurchase contracts because a weekly auction held on Thursdays
will be canceled this week due to a holiday, according to a
trader required to bid at the sales. The yuan jumped the most
since December yesterday, strengthening beyond 6.20 per dollar
for the first time in 19 years.  “The outlook for faster yuan appreciation is attracting a
lot of foreign capital,” said  Liu Dongliang , a senior analyst
in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-
biggest lender. “Liquidity will stay ample in the short term.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 10 basis points to 3.32 percent as
of 10:19 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. That’s the
biggest decline since March 27. China’s financial markets will
be shut tomorrow and on April 5 for a holiday.  China’s yuan has risen 0.5 percent this year to 6.2013 per
dollar, after appreciating 1.02 percent in 2012.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was unchanged at
3.26 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
