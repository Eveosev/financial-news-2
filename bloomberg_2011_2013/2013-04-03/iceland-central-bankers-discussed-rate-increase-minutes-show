Members of the Iceland central
bank’s policy board discussed increasing the benchmark interest
rate by 25 basis points at a March 19 meeting, according to
minutes published  today .  The Monetary Policy Committee “was of the opinion that,
based on information emerging since its last meeting, there were
grounds for keeping interest rates unchanged or for raising them
by 0.25 percentage points,” according to the minutes. Central
bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson “proposed that rates be held
unchanged.”  Four out of five committee members “voted in favor of the
Governor’s proposal,” according to the statement. One member
argued for raising rates by 0.25 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
