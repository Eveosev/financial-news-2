Spot gasoline in  California  advanced
against futures after a government report that stockpiles of the
fuel fell on the U.S. West Coast last week to the lowest level
for the season in six years.  Gasoline supplies on the West Coast, the PADD 5 region,
dropped for the eighth straight week, declining 2.6 percent to
28.7 million barrels in the seven days ended March 29, according
to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. That’s the least for the period
since 2007.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
strengthened 3 cents to a premium of 8 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:46 p.m.
New York time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Carbob in  Los
Angeles  rose 2.75 cents to 5.75 cents a gallon above futures.  The  premium  for Carbob in  San Francisco  versus the fuel in
Los Angeles climbed 0.25 cent to 2.25 cents a gallon. San
Francisco last week rose to the highest level against Los
Angeles in seven months.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco weakened
by 0.5 cent to a premium of 14 cents a gallon against ultra-low-
sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex. The same  fuel  in Los Angeles
rose 1 cent to a premium of 6.5 cents a gallon.  In  Portland ,  Oregon ,  low-sulfur diesel  strengthened by 1
cent to a 15-cent-a-gallon premium versus ULSD futures. Gasoline
there climbed 2 cents against gasoline futures to a discount of
5.5 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles dropped for the
second straight day, losing 49.9 cents to $19.79 a barrel at
2:05 p.m.  New York  time. The spread, a measure of refining
profitability, hit a one-year low of $3.86 a barrel in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
