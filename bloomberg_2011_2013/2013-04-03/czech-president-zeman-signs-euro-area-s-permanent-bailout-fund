Czech President Milos Zeman signed
the euro area’s permanent bailout fund, a mechanism that his
predecessor Vaclav Klaus called “monstrous.”  Zeman, who replaced Klaus as the head of state on March 8,
signed an amendment to the European Union’s treaties linked to
the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism today.
Zeman also raised the bloc’s flag above his Prague castle seat,
something Klaus refused to do during his 10 years in office, at
a ceremony attended by European Commission President  Jose
Barroso .  Klaus, a critic of the euro area and the EU’s handling of
the sovereign debt crisis, refused to sign the amendment to the
treaties, saying the euro rescue mechanism was “monstrous,
meaningless and absurd.” Klaus didn’t have the power to veto
the ESM and the rescue fund became operational without his
signature.  The  Czech Republic  has no target date for joining the euro
region and Zeman said last month the currency switch is possible
in five years at the earliest.  EU leaders approved the ESM amendment in March 2011 as part
of their efforts to overhaul governance of monetary union and
equip the euro area with the institutions and policies necessary
to tackle the fiscal crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
