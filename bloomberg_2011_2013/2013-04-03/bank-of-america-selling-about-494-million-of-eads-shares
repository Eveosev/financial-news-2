Spanish EADS Shares Warehousing Foundation is selling 9.6
million shares in  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EADS) ,
according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg news.  The stake is being offered at 39.50 euros to 40 euros
apiece, after there was demand for all the shares, said two
people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified as the information is private. EADS closed at 40.34
euros yesterday, down 1.9 percent.  At the high end of the range, the 1.2 percent stake is
worth 384 million euros ($493 million).  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  is
managing the sale, the terms show.  The sale comes after EADSâ€™s new board appointed Denis Ranque as chairman and backed a 3.75 billion-euro stock buyback.
State-owned Spanish industrial holdings company, Sociedad
Estatal de Participaciones Industriales, or SEPI, yesterday said
it cut its stake in EADS to 4.2 percent from 5.4 percent.  Companies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa have raised
$24.2 billion in additional share sales including block trades
this year, nearly 40 percent more than they sold in the same
period in 2012, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
