The central U.S. and Canada may cool
next week while the eastern and western coasts warm.  Temperatures April 8 to 12 may fall 3 to 5 degrees
Fahrenheit (2 to 3 Celsius) below normal through the center of
the country while rising that much above normal in California
and from Massachusetts to Florida, said  Matt Rogers , president
of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  “Lows could reach back down to the 40s again for  Dallas ,”
Rogers said today in a note to clients. “ Chicago  should see 2-3
days of below normal temperatures by late next week, too.”  April is the start of a transition to warmer weather, when
more energy is used to cool, rather than heat, homes. Until heat
builds in the Northern Hemisphere’s summer, the impact of the
weather on energy prices is less noticeable. About 50 percent of
U.S. households use gas for warmth.  The southern U.S. is expected to have temperatures 5 to 7
degrees above normal by April 13 to 17, according to  MDA Weather
Services  in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The warmth may reach into
New England, where temperatures are expected to be 3 to 4
degrees above normal during the period.  The normal average temperature on April 11 in  New York City 
is 51 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius), according to MDA. In
Boston, it’s 47; in Chicago, 47; in Houston, 69; in  St. Louis ,
56; and in Burbank, California, it’s 62.  To contact the reporter on this story:
