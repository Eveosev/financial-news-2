Barbara Piasecka Johnson, a former chambermaid who married into the  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  pharmaceutical family and walked away with part of its epic fortune following a bitterly contested battle over her husband’s will, has died. She was 76.  She died on April 1 in Poland following a long illness, according to her office, BPJ Holdings, in Princeton, New Jersey. One of the world’s richest women, she was a longtime resident of Monaco.  The Polish-born Johnson, known as Basia, in 1971 became the third wife of J. Seward Johnson, a son of  J&J (JNJ)  co-founder Robert Wood Johnson and a director of the New Brunswick, New Jersey- based company for 50 years. She was 34; he was 76 and had left his marriage of 32 years to be with her. They had met in 1968, when she began work in his New Jersey home as a cook and chambermaid, according to an  account  in People magazine.  J. Seward Johnson’s death in 1983 sparked a legal battle in Surrogate’s Court in Manhattan, between his six grown children and his widow over his will, which left her the bulk of his $500 million estate. In a 17-week trial in 1986 involving more than 200 lawyers, the children alleged that Barbara Johnson had coerced her dying husband into changing his will to her benefit, according to a  New York  Times account.  Barbara Johnson insisted her husband’s children were blaming her for family rifts that predated her arrival.  “I’m very sorry these children are ridiculing their father,” she said during the trial, according to People. “They were out of the will long before I came to this country.”  $350 Million  The two sides reached a settlement that awarded $350 million to Barbara Johnson and the rest to the children and to  Harbor Branch , the oceanographic institute in Fort Pierce,  Florida , that J. Seward Johnson had helped create.  In addition to the money, the agreement gave Barbara Johnson possession of the mansion she had built and shared with her husband -- a 46,000-square-foot Georgian-style villa on 140 acres in a wooded section of Princeton they had called Jasna Polana, Polish for “bright meadow.” She turned the property into a  private golf club  with a course designed by professional golfer Gary Player and the Johnson mansion serving as clubhouse.  Barbara Johnson resettled in  Monaco  and became an art collector and philanthropist. In March, Forbes magazine  estimated  her net worth to be $3.6 billion, making her one of the 50 richest women in the world.  Record Price  In 2004, Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, founder of Vienna’s Liechtenstein Museum, paid 19 million pounds, or $36.7 million at the time, for a Florentine cabinet auctioned in  London  by Johnson, making it the most expensive piece of furniture ever sold at auction. Made of ebony, gilt-bronze and precious stones, the so-called Badminton cabinet was originally crafted for Henry Somerset, the third Duke of Beaufort, by the Grand Ducal workshops in Florence in the 18th century.  In 2009, Johnson sold  Rembrandt ’s 1658 “Portrait of a Man with Arms Akimbo” for a record 20.2 million pounds, then $32.9 million, to a bidder later identified as Las Vegas casino developer Steve Wynn.  The largest public exhibition of her art that she organized, Opus Sacrum, was staged at the Royal Castle of Warsaw,  Poland , in 1990 and in Liechtenstein in 1991, according to her office.  In 1990, Johnson said she might spend as much as $100 million to revive the  Gdansk Shipyard  in Poland, which a decade earlier had spawned the Solidarity resistance movement to communism in Eastern Europe. Her proposed involvement proved too difficult to carry out.  Immigrant’s Arrival  Barbara Piasecka was born on Feb. 25, 1937, in Staniewicze, Poland, to Pelagia and Wojciech Piasecki, according to Marquis Who’s Who.  She earned degrees in art history from the University of Wroclaw and emigrated to the U.S. from  Rome  in 1968, arriving with $100 and speaking little English, according to the Times.  She went to work for J. Seward Johnson and his second wife, the former Esther Underwood, at their estate in Oldwick, New Jersey. She left after nine months to study English in  Manhattan , at which point J. Seward Johnson dispatched his chauffeur to bring her to his New Jersey office, where he professed his love, according to People.  “I never expect it, because we could hardly talk to each other,” she later explained, the magazine said. Together they began assembling a collection of paintings by Monet, Picasso, Rembrandt, Titian and other artists.  Through the Princeton-based Barbara Piasecka Johnson Foundation, Johnson supported Polish students in the U.S. and humanitarian projects in Poland, among other causes. In recent years she focused on providing help to children and young adults with autism.
