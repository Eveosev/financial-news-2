Taiwan dollar forwards weakened for
a third day as optimism the  U.S. economy  is recovering boosted
demand for the greenback.  Government bonds  were little changed
before an auction today.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell for a third
day after a report yesterday showed factory orders in the
world’s biggest economy rose the most in five months in February.
Taiwan will sell NT$40 billion ($1.3 billion) of five-year debt
at 1.025 percent today, according to the median estimate of
eight fixed-income traders surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The dollar is getting increasingly strong as the economy
is showing more signs of improvement,” said Eric Hsing, a
fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Bond
yields aren’t moving much before the auction.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards traded at NT$29.868 per
dollar as of 10:15 a.m. local time, compared with NT$29.86
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The local
dollar climbed 0.1 percent to NT$29.887, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It was trading 0.2 percent stronger one minute before
the 4 p.m. finish yesterday and ended little changed.  The central bank has sold the local currency in the run-up
to the close on most days in the past year, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a gauge
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.47 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018 was
1.015 percent, compared with 1.014 percent yesterday, according
to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending 
rate was steady at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
