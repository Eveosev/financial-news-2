Indian exporters need about 100
billion rupees ($1.84 billion) of government assistance to boost
overseas sales, the head of an industry group said.  “A realistic export target for  India  for the year through
March 2014 will be $360 billion to $375 billion,” Ajay Sahai,
the chief executive officer of the New Delhi-based  Federation of
Indian Export Organizations , said in an interview late yesterday.
Sixty percent of the money should be used to fund the promotion
of India’s overseas sales and the rest to subsidize credit for
exporters, he said.  An uneven global recovery has hampered Indian shipments,
which climbed 4.2 percent in February after declining for most
of the prior 12 months. Struggling exports have contributed to a
record current-account deficit, adding pressure on the
government to lure foreign capital and take steps in the trade
policy statement due April 18 to spur overseas sales.  The current-account gap reached $32.6 billion in the
quarter ended Dec. 31, or 6.7 percent of gross domestic product.
The shortfall has weighed on the rupee, which has weakened 6.8
percent against the dollar in the past year, the most after the
yen in a basket of 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
