Intel Corp. (INTC)  Chief Executive Officer
Paul Otellini’s total compensation increased 8.6 percent to $19
million last year.  His base salary rose 9.1 percent to $1.2 million, the Santa
Clara, California-based company said today in a regulatory
filing. The total also includes bonus, stock, options, pension
and other benefits.  Otellini plans to retire in May after almost four decades
at Intel. The CEO said in December that an insider would most
likely be picked to succeed him. When Intel announced Otellini’s
planned departure in November, it also signaled potential
replacements by naming three executive vice presidents: Chief
Operating Officer Brian Krzanich, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith and software head Renee James.  To contact the reporter on this story:
