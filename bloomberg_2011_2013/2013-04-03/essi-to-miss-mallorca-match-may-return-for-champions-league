Lionel Messi will miss Barcelona’s
league match against Mallorca in three days, but has not been
ruled out of the club’s  Champions League  game next week.  Messi was removed from last night’s 2-2 quarterfinal first-
leg draw at Paris Saint-Germain at halftime because of a
hamstring injury and underwent tests today.  “The club’s medical services have revealed that Leo
Messi’s injury will definitely rule him out of this weekend’s
game against Mallorca, while his availability after that will
depend on how the injury progresses,” Barcelona said in a
 statement  on its website.  Messi scored Barcelona’s opening goal in the 38th minute
last night and started rubbing his hamstring shortly after that.
The four-time world player of the year was on the bench during
the second half after being replaced by  Cesc Fabregas .  Barcelona hosts PSG in the return match of their
quarterfinal on April 10. The club said Messi suffered a similar
injury in 2008 during a Champions League match and was sidelined
for five weeks.  Messi’s absence against Mallorca will end his 19-game
scoring streak in La Liga. Last weekend he became the first
player with a goal against every other team in the top division
in successive matches when scored against Celta Vigo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
