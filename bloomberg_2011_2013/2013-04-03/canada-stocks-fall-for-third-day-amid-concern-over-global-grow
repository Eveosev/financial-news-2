Canadian stocks  fell for a third
day, sending the benchmark index to its longest losing streak
since February, as worse-than-estimated U.S. data spurred
concern over global economic growth.  Nine of 10 industry groups in the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index (SPTSX)  declined, with financial and energy companies
contributing most to the index’s drop. Manulife Financial Corp.
fell 2 percent. Toronto-Dominion Bank slipped 0.6 percent after
its chief executive announced plans to retire in 2014. Encana
Corp. dropped 2 percent as  oil prices  retreated. FirstService
Corp. gained 3 percent after announcing a dividend and a plan to
simplify its  capital structure .  The S&P/TSX fell 75.21 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,606.89
at 10:25 a.m. in Toronto, poised for the lowest close since Jan.
14. The gauge lost 1.1 percent over three days, the longest
stretch of losses since Feb. 15.  American companies boosted employment by 158,000 workers in
March, figures from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research
Institute showed today. The median forecast of 39 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 200,000 gain.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers almost 90 percent of the
economy, fell to 54.4 in March from 56 in the prior month, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said. The median forecast of 73
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 55.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
