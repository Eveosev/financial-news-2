The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 3 basis points to
118.5 as of 10:52 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. The measure, which declined last quarter for the third
consecutive period, is set for its lowest close since March 26,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  retreated 2 to 119 as of 8:32 a.m. in
 Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show. The
benchmark, which has ranged from 100.5 to 122.3 since Dec. 31,
is also on course for the lowest since March 26, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 1 basis point to
113 as of 9:29 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. The gauge, which has ranged from 101 to 148.1 this year,
is poised for its first decline since March 28, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
