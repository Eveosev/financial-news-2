Ukrainian opposition parties, which
blockaded parliament for two weeks in February over voting
rules, again stopped the legislature from working to demand
mayoral elections in the capital, Kiev.  Jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko’s party, world
boxing champion Vitali Klitschko’s UDAR party and the Svoboda
party surrounded the speaker’s rostrum, preventing today’s
session from starting. Kiev hasn’t had a mayor since 2010.  “The ruling party is against elections in Kiev because
they don’t have support and they’re afraid of losing
administrative and financial influence in the capital,”
Klitschko said. “We get the impression that if they could
they’d cancel Kiev elections altogether.”  Former Kiev Mayor Leonid Chernovetskyi stepped down in 2010
after the presidential victory of Viktor Yanukovych, who
appointed Oleksandr Popov as city administrator, leaving the
mayor’s post vacant. While Yanukovych’s ruling Party of Regions
got more votes than its rivals in Oct. 28 general elections, the
opposition won in Kiev.  Parliament failed yesterday to set a June date for Kiev
elections, with only 206 lawmakers in the 450-seat legislature
voting in favor as people gathered outside to call for a ballot.
Opposition parties vowed to continue blocking parliament
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
