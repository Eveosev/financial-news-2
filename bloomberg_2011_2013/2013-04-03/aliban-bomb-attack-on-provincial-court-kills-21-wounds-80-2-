Taliban guerrillas detonated a bomb
and opened fire on Afghan security forces as they attacked a
court near the compound of a provincial governor today, killing
at least 21 people and wounding about 80 others.  Attackers were also killed, according to the Associated
Press tally of the casualties. Seven Taliban fighters armed with
grenades, rocket-launchers, Kalashnikov rifles and suicide vests
carried out the assault, Mohammad Akram Khpalwak, the provincial
governor of Farah province, said by phone.  The insurgents managed “to enter the provincial court and
a local bank,” Khpalwak said. Two or three militants were still
fighting, while others had been killed. Some government workers
had been taken hostage, the governor said.  The battle began at 9:20 a.m. local time in the volatile
province that borders  Iran . Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi claimed responsibility in a phone interview saying
members of the insurgent group were on trial in the court.  Afghan forces are taking the lead in many security
operations as U.S. forces exit after a 12-year war with the
Taliban.  President  Barack Obama  has ordered the withdrawal of half
of the roughly 68,000 American troops by next February. American
officials have said the president is considering keeping 8,000
to 12,000 forces from the U.S. and NATO to support and train
Afghans or play a limited role fighting terrorists if an
agreement can be reached to secure their immunity from local
prosecution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
