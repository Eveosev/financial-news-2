BHP Billiton  Ltd. expects Eskom
Holdings SOC Ltd. to honor deals to supply power to its aluminum
smelters in  South Africa , Xolani Mkhwanazi, chairman of the
mining company’s local unit, said in a BusinessDay commentary.  Eskom, the state-run power utility, sells 9 percent of the
nation’s electricity at below its cost of production to BHP’s
Hillside and Mozal smelters, the Beeld newspaper said March 22.  “The Eskom contracts were negotiated on a risk-sharing
basis and in terms of a recognized international model,”
Mkhwanazi wrote in Johannesburg-based BusinessDay. “Over the
period of contracts BHP Billiton for many years paid above the
standard electricity tariff for the industry. Eskom has
generated significant additional revenues and benefits.”  The Supreme Couth of Appeal on March 15 granted an order
forcing Eskom to disclose tariffs for BHP’s aluminum smelters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
