Guatemala ’s Energy and Mines
Ministry awarded licenses to Compania Guatemalteca de Niquel,
S.A. and Minera San Rafael S.A. to begin mineral extraction in
Central America’s largest economy, the ministry said in a
statement published on its website.  Minera San Rafael S.A., which will mine for gold, silver
nickel and cobalt, forecasts annual production around $400
million. The Compania Guatemalteca de Niquel, S.A., which will
mine for nickel, cobalt and iron, has invested $380 million in
the project to date, according to the ministry.  Extraction will be controlled to two regions of Guatemala
and will generate around 3,000 employees, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
