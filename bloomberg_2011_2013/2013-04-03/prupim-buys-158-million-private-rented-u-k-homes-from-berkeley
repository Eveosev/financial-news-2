Prupim, the real estate unit of M&G
Investments, agreed to buy a portfolio of rental homes in  London 
and southeast  England  for 105.4 million pounds ($158 million)
from  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc. (BKG)   The 534 properties are being built by Cobham, England-based
Berkeley, the U.K.’s third-largest homebuilder, and the Homes
and Communities Agency, Prupim said in an e-mailed statement
today. The buyer will take over management after the completion
of construction, expected in June.  “The expanding residential rental property market,
particularly in London and southern England, is gaining appeal
for institutional investors,” Prupim Chief Executive Officer
Alex Jeffrey said in the statement. “We believe that returns
from the sector -- which have historically outpaced commercial
real estate -- will continue to be attractive as demand
increases.”  The U.K. government increased funding for newly built
rental homes to 1 billion pounds from 200 million pounds this
month as it encourages institutional investors to become
landlords. Efforts to boost the rental market come as a lack of
mortgage lending and higher barriers for borrowers makes it
necessary for more families to rent.  The homes being bought by London-based Prupim were
developed under the government’s 2009 Private Rented Sector
Initiative, which used HCA funding to start the development.  Property broker  Savills Plc (SVS)  will handle the day-to-day
management of the properties, Prupim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
