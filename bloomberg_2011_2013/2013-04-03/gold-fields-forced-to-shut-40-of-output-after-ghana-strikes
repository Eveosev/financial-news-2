Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  said it was forced
to shut its Ghana operations after illegal strikes, shutting
more than 40 percent of the South African miner’s output.  The Tarkwa and Damang mines stopped production at about 11
a.m. local time today after workers started industrial action,
the company said in a statement issued by  Johannesburg Stock
Exchange . The Ghana Mineworkers Union and other labor groups
yesterday presented management at both mines with demands.  Tarkwa produced 719,000 ounces of gold and Damang 218,000
last year, according to a company presentation. West African
operations comprise 43 percent of production and 22 percent of
reserves since Gold Fields spun off most of its mature South
African assets as  Sibanye Gold (SGL) , a separate company.  Worker demands include the reinstatement of an employee who
was dismissed, the removal of certain members of senior
management, and the investigation of allegations of
discrimination between expatriate and Ghanaian employees, the
company said. “Gold Fields is analyzing and investigating the
demands as a matter of urgency.”  Gold Fields said it expects to produce 476,000 ounces in
the first quarter, according to a separate release. Cash costs
are expected to be $830 per ounce.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
