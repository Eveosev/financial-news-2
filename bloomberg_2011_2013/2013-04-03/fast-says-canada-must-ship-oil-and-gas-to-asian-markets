Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast said
the country “must” begin to ship more oil and gas to Asian
markets.  Asian countries have an “incentive” to help ensure  Canada 
develops its resources, including the world’s third largest pool
of oil reserves, Fast said in a speech at a Vancouver conference
organized by the  Asia  Pacific Foundation of Canada. The country
doesn’t export any gas to Japan and very little oil to Asia, he
said.  “We want to change that, we must change that,” Fast said,
according to a prepared text of the speech provided by his
office. “The  oil sands  are a great Canadian success story and
we are keen to export this important energy source to our
Pacific neighbors.”  Prime Minister  Stephen Harper , who has touted Canada as an
emerging “energy superpower,” has called it a national
priority to build infrastructure that will let Canada diversify
energy exports away from the U.S. and ship oil to Asia, a policy
that has faced resistance from environmentalists and opposition
lawmakers.  International energy giants from Exxon Mobil Corp. to
Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd are considering terminal
projects in western Canada to supply Asian utilities and
factories that are paying more than four times the price of U.S.
markets for natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
