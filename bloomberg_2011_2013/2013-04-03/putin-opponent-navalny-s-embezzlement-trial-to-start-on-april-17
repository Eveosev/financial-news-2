The trial of Alexey Navalny, a
Russian anti-corruption activist who helped lead protests
against President  Vladimir Putin , will start in two weeks.  A Kirov district court, northeast of Moscow, will hold the
first hearing on April 17, it said on its  website  today.  Navalny and another person are accused of defrauding state
timber company Kirovles of 16 million rubles ($507,000), the
General Prosecutor’s office said last month. Two other criminal
cases have been opened against the activist.  Navalny, a lawyer who campaigns to expose fraud and waste
at state companies and corruption by officials, faces as much as
10 years in prison in the three cases, according to the criminal
code. He denies any wrongdoing and denounces his prosecution as
politically motivated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
