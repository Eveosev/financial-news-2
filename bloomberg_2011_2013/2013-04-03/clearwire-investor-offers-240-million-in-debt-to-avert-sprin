(Corrects Crest position on Dish in third paragraph of
April 3 story.)  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  investor Crest
Financial Ltd. offered to provide the wireless  Internet company 
with $240 million in financing as an alternative to taking money
from potential acquirer  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)   The convertible debt offer, announced today in a statement,
comes less than a week after Clearwire drew $80 million in
financing from Sprint for a second straight month. The financing
from Sprint, which already owns just over 50 percent of the
Bellevue, Washington-based company, can be converted to
Clearwire stock at $1.50 a share.  Crest is one of the minority shareholders that has opposed
Sprint’s proposal to acquire the rest of Clearwire for $2.97 a
share. Crest has said it supports the sale of Clearwire’s
wireless airwaves to other parties, such as  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)   The terms of Crest’s convertible debt are better than
Sprint’s  and are “designed to free Clearwire to explore
alternatives to Sprint’s inadequate merger offer,” the investor
said in the statement. Crest’s proposed notes could be converted
to Clearwire stock at $2 a share.  “We have received the proposal from Crest Financial,”
said Mike DiGioia, a Clearwire spokesman. “Our special
committee of the board will evaluate the offer to determine
what, if any, action to take.”  Clearwire rose less than 1 percent to $3.28 at the close in
New York.  Scott Sloat , a Sprint spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
