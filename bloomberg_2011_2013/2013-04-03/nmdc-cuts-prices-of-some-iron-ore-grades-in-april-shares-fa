NMDC Ltd. (NMDC) ,  India â€™s biggest iron ore
producer, cut the prices of some grades of the steelmaking
ingredient for the third time in 2013 as domestic demand
slumped. The shares declined.  The state-owned miner lowered the price of the high-grade
lump ore by about 7 percent this month, Finance Director
Swaminathan Thiagarajan said today in a text message. Low-grade
fines were unchanged from last month, he said.  The  company , the worst performer on the  S&P BSE Metal Index (BSEMETL) 
today, fell as much as 2.4 percent to 133.05 rupees and traded 2
percent lower as of 12:19 p.m. in Mumbai. The Metal Index
climbed 0.2 percent.  NMDC, based in the southern city of Hyderabad, has cut
prices by more than 15 percent since January as domestic demand
fell, tracking a global trend. Benchmark prices in  China  dropped
9 percent last month, according to The Steel Index.  Ore prices may fall to $100 a ton in the third and fourth
quarters next year compared with $127 a ton in the second
quarter of 2013, James Glenn and Rob Brooker, analysts at
National Australia Bank Ltd. said in a report today. New mine
supplies and slowing demand may push the price down below $100 a
ton, Bloomberg Industries analysts Kenneth Hoffman and Andrew
Cosgrove wrote on March 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
