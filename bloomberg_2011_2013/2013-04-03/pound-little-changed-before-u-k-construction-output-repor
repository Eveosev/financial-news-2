The pound strengthened from a two-
week low against the dollar amid speculation the  Bank of England 
will tomorrow refrain from extending stimulus measures that tend
to devalue the currency.  Sterling rose versus most of its major counterparts as a
report showed U.K. shop-price inflation accelerated last month.
Central-bank policy makers will maintain their  asset-purchase 
target at 375 billion pounds ($568 billion), according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Minutes of the last two
meetings showed three members of the nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee, including Governor  Mervyn King , voted to boost so-
called quantitative easing. Gilts advanced.  “We are focused on the Bank of England tomorrow but they
are trapped a bit by inflation remaining stubbornly high,” said
 Simon Smith , chief economist at FxPro Group Ltd. in  London .
“We’re seeing expectations that King can gain a consensus for
more QE being tempered. There seem to be two relatively well
entrenched camps at the moment.”  The pound climbed 0.2 percent to $1.5141 as of 4:10 p.m.
London time after falling to $1.5076, the lowest level since
March 20. The U.K. currency was little changed at 84.84 pence
per euro.  FxPro’s Smith said he doesn’t expect an expansion in
quantitative easing tomorrow.  Retail Prices  U.K. retail prices rose 1.4 percent from a year earlier,
compared with an increase of 1.1 percent in February, the
 British Retail Consortium  said today. The impact of the pound’s
5 percent decline since the start of the year is beginning to
show in the figures, the group said.  The  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said its
 index  of construction activity increased to 47.2 last month from
46.8 in February, still below the 50 level that divides
expansion and contraction.  Benchmark 10-year gilt  yields  dropped two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.76 percent. The price of the 1.75
percent bond due in September 2022 rose 0.18, or 1.80 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 99.95.  The pound has declined 5.1 percent this year, the worst
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 2.7
percent and the euro fell 0.3 percent.  Gilts returned 0.6 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
0.3 percent, while Treasuries fell 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
