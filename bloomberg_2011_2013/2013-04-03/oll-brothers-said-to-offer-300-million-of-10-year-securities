A unit of  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the
largest U.S. luxury-home builder, sold $300 million of 10-year
debt.  Toll Brothers Finance Corp.’s 4.375 percent notes due April
2023 yield 256 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds
will be used for general corporate purposes, including paying
down debt, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based property developer
said today in a regulatory filing.  The company sold 10-year notes in January 2012, issuing
5.875 percent debentures to yield 407.6 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. The bonds traded at 111.5 cents
on the dollar to yield 4.3 percent on March 26, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. managed today’s
sale, Bloomberg data show. The bonds are rated Ba1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, BB+ at Standard & Poor’s and BBB- by Fitch
Ratings, the data show.  The homebuilding industry is benefiting from a recovering
bond market as the Federal Reserve continues asset purchases
aimed at keeping interest rates low to boost economic growth.
The  rate  for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.57 percent on March
28, down from an  average  of 6.2 percent from 2005 to 2007,
according to Freddie Mac data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
