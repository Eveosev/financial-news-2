Manchester City soccer striker
 Carlos Tevez  was today sentenced to 250 hours of community
service for driving while disqualified and without insurance,
the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  The 29-year-old Argentine national team player also
received a six-month driving ban and a 1,000-pound ($1,511) fine
after pleading guilty to the offenses at Macclesfield
Magistrates’ Court in northwest England. Driving while
disqualified can carry a jail term of up to six months.  Tevez played for Boca Juniors in Argentina and Brazil’s
Corinthians before moving in 2006 to West Ham, where his goals
helped the London team avoid relegation from the Premier League.  A year later he switched to  Manchester United  where he won
two league titles, and in 2009 he moved to City, which won the
league last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
