Oscar Pistorius , the South African
paralympian accused of killing his model girlfriend, wants to
resume training now that his bail conditions have been loosened,
his manager said.  “Competing is still a way off,” Peet van Zyl said by
phone today. “We need to get him back on the track. Just to get
some normality back into his life.”  Pistorius, the double amputee athlete known as the  Blade
Runner  because of his prosthetic legs, has not trained since he
was arrested on Feb. 14, Valentine’s Day. Prosecutors charged
him with premeditated murder for the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp, 29, at his Pretoria home. Pistorius says he
accidentally shot her, thinking she was a burglar. A judge on
March 28 lifted a ban on him traveling, allowing him to compete.  The athlete won six Paralympic gold medals for running and
was the first paralympian to run at an Olympics, competing at
the London games last year. Pistorius, 26, was born without
fibulas and had both legs amputated at knee at 11 months old.  To contact the reporter on this story:
