Porsche, the sports-car brand owned
by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , will offer plug-in hybrid and extended-
wheelbase variants in the second generation of its Panamera
four-door coupe, which will be unveiled in  China  this month.  The revamped Panamera will hit showrooms from July with
prices in  Germany  starting at 81,849 euros ($104,775) for the
base diesel version, the Stuttgart-based VW unit said today in a
statement. The cars will debut at the Shanghai auto show in
China starting April 21.  “An already unrivaled broad base of models has now been
extended and consists of 10 models, offering an even further
range between sportiness and comfort,” the carmaker said.  Porsche is expanding its lineup after Volkswagen,  Europe ’s
biggest carmaker, took full control of the brand in August. The
maker of the 911 sports car introduced revamped versions of the
Boxster roadster and the Cayman sports car last year, making
them lighter and faster to shore up its reputation for
performance. It will roll out the compact Macan sport-utility
vehicle for customers in early 2014.  The 416-horsepower Panamera S E-Hybrid, which is boosted by
a 95-horsepower electric motor, costs 110,409 euros. The car has
a top speed of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour and can
accelerate to 100 kph in 5.5 seconds. The vehicle can drive 18
to 36 kilometers on the power stored in its lithium-ion battery.  Ferrari Approach  “Offering a plug-in hybrid is just part of the game” and
is in line with Ferrari’s approach with the LaFerrari model,
said Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG.
Porsche has access to a wide range of technologies now that its
fully integrated into Volkswagen.  The 963-horsepower LaFerrari, which was presented at the
Geneva auto show last month and is priced at 1 million euros,
will compete with Porsche’s own super hybrid. The 918 Spyder, an
$845,000 limited-run sportster, will be Porsche’s most expensive
model ever when deliveries start later this year.  The 15-centimeter (6-inch) longer Executive variant of the
Panamera is priced from 132,662 euros and comes in 4S and Turbo
versions. Extended-wheelbase models are geared chiefly at the
Chinese market, where many luxury-car buyers have drivers.  Porsche is also introducing a new V6 biturbo engine in the
Panamera, replacing a previous V8 as manufacturers look to
improve efficiency. The engine boosts fuel economy as much as 18
percent while still adding 20 horsepower, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
