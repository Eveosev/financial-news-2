Chile ’s central bank is less likely
to step in to weaken the currency after its monetary policy
report yesterday, according to Banco de Credito & Inversiones.  The  real exchange rate , an inflation-adjusted measure of
the currency’s strength against trading partners, is within a
range consistent with economic fundamentals, the central bank
said yesterday as it raised its growth forecast for this year.  “It’s pretty definitive,” Felipe Alarcon, an economist at
BCI in Santiago, said in a telephone interview. “The central
bank says its working assumption is that the real  exchange rate 
is within range and that it’s consistent with long-term
fundamentals. That’s a major non-intervention signal.”  Volatility in the currency has been the lowest in 15 years
as concern the central bank would intervene prevented the peso
from appreciating through 470 per  U.S. dollar .  The peso slid 0.1 percent to 472.45 per U.S. dollar at
11:30 a.m. in Santiago, paring its rally in 2013 to 1.4 percent.
The currency has traded in a range of 471 to 474 per dollar
since March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
