Slovakia is set to miss its budget-
deficit goal this year as slowing growth is reducing government
revenue, Moody’s Investors Service said.  “While we expect the government to take further corrective
measures to close the gap created by lower-than-budgeted
revenue, we believe that fiscal slippage related to the
weakening economy will prevent the government from achieving its
deficit target,” the ratings company said in note e-mailed
today from  London .  The export-oriented eastern euro-area member has been hurt
by slowing demand its western peers, pushing economic  growth  to
the lowest level since the 2009 recession. The resulting revenue
shortfall increases the risk Slovakia will not trim its  budget
deficit  to the targeted level of 3 percent of gross domestic
product, Moody’s said.  The ratings company cut its forecast for economic growth
this year to 0.9 percent from 1.4 percent, compared with a 1.2
percent prediction by the government. Still, the country’s
credit profile remains in line with its current rating of A2,
the sixth-best grade, Moody’s said.  The European Commission in February predicted the fiscal
gap will reach 3.3 percent this year, 0.3 percentage point above
the European Union’s limit. The deficit was a preliminary 4.5
percent of GDP in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
