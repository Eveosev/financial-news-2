The pound pared an advance against
the euro after an industry report showed that construction
output in the U.K. contracted more than economists forecast in
March.  The U.K. currency was little changed at 84.85 pence per
euro as of 9:35 a.m. London time, after earlier strengthening as
much as 0.2 percent to 84.69 pence.  The pound was little changed at $1.5102.  To contact the reporter on this story:
