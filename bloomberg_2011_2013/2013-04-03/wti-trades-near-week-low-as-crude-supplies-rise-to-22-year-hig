Brent crude  rose amid speculation
yesterday’s 3.2 percent slide was exaggerated given efforts by
central banks around the world to revive their economies.  Brent climbed as much as 0.9 percent in London, after a
decline that drove it to its lowest settlement in four months.
West Texas Intermediate swung between gains and losses after
yesterday posting its steepest loss this year following data
showing U.S. stockpiles rose to the most in almost 23 years.  “Today is the day after the day before, where the most
likely move is a retracement from the losses yesterday,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in
Copenhagen, said today by phone. “Yesterday there was weaker
U.S. data, high oil inventories and negative performance on the
stock market, all three of which pulled the rock from underneath
the crude price.”  Brent for May settlement on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange was at $107.53 a barrel, up 42 cents, at 1:25
p.m.  London  time. It fell to $107.11 yesterday, the lowest
closing price since Dec. 7. The volume of all futures traded was
42 percent higher than the 100-day average. Brent is down 3.1
percent this year.  WTI for May delivery fell 19 cents to $94.26 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Trading
was 2.8 percent above the 100-day average. The contract dropped
$2.74, or 2.8 percent, to $94.45 yesterday, the biggest decline
since Nov. 20 and the lowest closing price since March 22. The
European benchmark grade was at a premium of $13.27 to WTI
futures, compared with $12.66 yesterday.  Central Banks  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said today it will purchase 7.5 trillion
yen ($78.6 billion) of bonds a month and double the monetary
base in two years. HSBC Holdings Plc and Nomura Securities Co.
said the easing is the nation’s biggest yet. The  European
Central Bank  left its benchmark rate at a record low and the
 Bank of England  maintained bond purchases at 375 billion pounds
($568 billion), both of which were in line with surveys.  Brent rebounded after reaching technical support yesterday
along the so-called neckline of a “head-and-shoulders” chart
pattern, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures halted
declines in January and March along this line, which is around
$106.70 a barrel today. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
chart-support levels, while losses may accelerate when a support
level is breached.  Brent will average $112 a barrel this year, Barclays Plc
said yesterday in an e-mailed report, reducing its forecast from
$125, which had been the highest of all analyst forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg. WTI will average $95 this year, compared
with a previous prediction of $108, according to the bank.  “In the short term, Brent is likely to move toward the
$108.70 area with $108.90 the highest we can reach as a
potential retracement,” Hansen said.  Cushing Stockpiles  U.S. inventories rose by 2.7 million barrels to 388.6
million last week, the highest since 1990, the Energy
Information Administration said yesterday. They were projected
to gain 2.1 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI futures, dropped by 287,000 barrels to 49.2 million last
week. They rose to a record 51.9 million in January.  The  International Energy Agency  sees a “more comfortable
supply balance” in the medium term, Maria van der Hoeven, the
agency’s executive director, said today at a conference in
Paris.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  fell 572,000 barrels to 220.7
million last week, the lowest since December, according to the
EIA. Supplies of  distillate fuel , including diesel and heating
oil, slid 2.3 million barrels to 113 million, the data showed.  Refineries operated at 86.3 percent of capacity last week,
the highest rate in two months, the EIA reported. Processing
units are traditionally restarted in the spring after being
idled for maintenance in late winter as production shifts away
from heating oil and before the peak season for gasoline
consumption.  The Norwegian Energy Industry union warned that failure to
reach an agreement in current wage talks may shut as many as 20
platforms in the  North Sea .  The union could pull as many as 1,559 workers off the job
starting at 6 a.m. on April 8, it said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
