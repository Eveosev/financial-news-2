Gold dropped to the lowest level in
more than three weeks as investors cut holdings of the metal
after the dollar gained and data showed an improving U.S.
economy. Silver and platinum also fell.  Bullion for immediate delivery lost as much as 0.8 percent
at $1,563.68 an ounce, the lowest price since March 8 and traded
at $1,567.24 at 11:43 a.m. in  Singapore . Futures for June
delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,568 an ounce on the Comex.  Gold is in a “bubble” and will head into a so-called bear
market as improving U.S. economic growth prompts the Federal
Reserve to curb stimulus efforts, Societe Generale SA analysts
including London-based Robin Bhar said in a report yesterday.
Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, dropped to 1,208.92 metric tons
yesterday, the lowest level since July 2011, according to
figures on the company’s website.  “People who are optimistic about the U.S. may see less
need of holding gold,” Diego Parrilla, chief investment officer
of Singapore-based Nareco Advisors Pte, said by phone today.  Prices have fallen 6.5 percent this year, after 12 straight
annual gains, as a rally in equities and stronger economic
growth cut demand for the precious metal as a haven. Orders
placed with U.S. factories rose the most in five months in
February, a Commerce Department report showed yesterday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities closed higher
yesterday, having gained  10 percent  this year as the dollar
against a basket of six currencies advanced 4 percent.  Gold will slide to $1,375 by December and average $1,500
this year and $1,400 in 2014, Societe Generale estimates. The
metal as much as doubled after central banks, led by the Fed,
increased stimulus since 2008 to bolster economic growth.  Cash silver, which fell into a bear market yesterday, fell
0.9 percent to $27.025, cheapest since Aug. 2. Cash platinum
lost as much as 0.7 percent to $1,561.25 a ton, the lowest since
March 20, before trading at $1,563.75. That pared this year’s
gains to 1.6 percent. Spot palladium dropped 0.2 percent at
$764.80 an ounce, trimming the annual increase to 8.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
