Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8) ,
 Germany ’s biggest cable company, is seeking to cut borrowing
cost with a term loan of at least 600 million euros ($771
million) to replace debt.  Lenders are asked to commit to the seven-year term portion
H by April 12 which will repay a term portion D due in December
2016 and term slice G expiring in March 2017, the Unterfoehring-
based company said today in a statement.  Kabel Deutschland  is offering to pay interest at 300 basis
points more than the euro interbank offered rate for debt for
Kabel Deutschland Vertrieb und Service GmbH, according to the
statement. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The company fixed the cost of the 400 million-euro term
loan term loan D at 6.07 percent through an interest-hedging
arrangement in 2011, according to its  earnings report  on Feb.
20. The existing term loan G pays interest at 350 basis points
more than Euribor, according to the report.  Kabel Deutschland had 3.4 billion euros of total debt at
the end of 2012 and 540 million euros of cash, according to the
 earnings report.   The company’s net debt was 3.4 times its earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at the end of
December, within its target range of 3 times to 3.5 times by the
end of March 2013, according to the earnings report.  BNP Paribas SA and Deutsche Bank AG are coordinating the
transaction, with ING Groep NV, Morgan Stanley, and Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc also arranging the deal, according to the
statement. The banks also agreed to provide 270 million euros of
 credit line  due in March 2019.  The company is offering six-month soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value to refinance the term loan H during the first
six months, according to the statement.  The term loan H may be priced at 99.75 cents to 100 cents
on the euro, according to a person with knowledge of the matter,
who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t
public.  The arranging banks plan to distribute the  loan on April
15, before funding on April 30, Kabel Deutschland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
