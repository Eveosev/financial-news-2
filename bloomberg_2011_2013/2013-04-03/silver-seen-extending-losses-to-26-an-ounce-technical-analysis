Silver for immediate delivery, which
tumbled into a  bear market  yesterday, may decline toward $26 an
ounce, a level last traded in 2010, according to Barclays Plc.  The metal’s close below a support level of $27.95 an ounce
yesterday will prompt technical selling and pressure prices,
Dhiren Sarin, chief technical strategist for Asia Pacific, said
today by phone from  Singapore . Since the beginning of 2011, spot
silver has tested the $26 level four times and managed to stay
above that, making it a key support, he said.  Silver entered a bear market yesterday when it closed more
than 20 percent below an Oct. 4 high. The reading on the 14-day
relative strength index was 24.55 today, below the level of 30
that’s taken as a signal of a possible rebound.  “Silver is oversold on daily and weekly charts but often
this can be ignored when the price is lacking signs of a base,”
Sarin said. “A price level at $26 is now in the spotlight.”  Cash silver fell as much as 1.3 percent today to $26.925 an
ounce, the lowest level since July 25, before trading at $26.935
by 2:36 p.m. Singapore time. That extended this year’s losses to
11 percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
