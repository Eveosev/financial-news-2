Nigeria ’s naira rose to the highest
in almost four weeks as the central bank sold the U.S. currency
at an auction and oil companies were also said to sell dollars.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer rose 0.3
percent to 158.10 per dollar by 4:10 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, the highest since March 8, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $237 million at an auction
today, compared with $300 million at the previous sale on March
27, it said in an e-mailed statement.  The Abuja-based bank offers foreign currency at auctions on
Mondays and Wednesdays to maintain exchange-rate stability. It
didn’t hold a sale on April 1 because of a public holiday.  Oil
companies , which sell dollars to meet domestic expenses, are the
second-biggest source of the currency after the central bank.  The “central bank’s sale complemented about $100 million
supplied by two oil companies to support the naira,” Tunde
Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain
Investment Ltd., said by phone.  Yields on the government’s local-currency bonds due June
2019 declined 31 basis points to 10.65 percent, according to
yesterday’s prices compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Borrowing costs on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 slipped seven basis points to 4.31 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi declined 0.1 percent to 1.9410 per dollar in
Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
