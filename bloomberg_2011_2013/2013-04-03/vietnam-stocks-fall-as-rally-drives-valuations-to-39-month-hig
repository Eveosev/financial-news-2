Vietnam   stocks  fell the most in
 Asia , snapping a three-day advance that drove valuations to the
highest level in more than three years.  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s benchmark  VN Index (VNINDEX) 
fell 0.7 percent to 505.93 at the close, the biggest loss since
March 26. The measure climbed 3.8 percent in the three days
through April 2, driving the gauge’s valuation to 14.4 times
reported profit, the highest level since December 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vingroup Joint-Stock
Co. (VIC) , the biggest listed property company, dropped 2.3 percent.  “The market was overheating in the last few days,” said
Giang Trung Kien, Hanoi-based head of research at FPT Securities
Co. “We may see more light corrections in the next sessions.”  Stocks climbed earlier this week after the  State Bank  of
Vietnam cut its policy interest rates by one percentage point on
March 25 to spur the economy and boost lending as inflation
slowed to 6.64 percent in March. That was the seventh reduction
in borrowing costs since the start of 2012.  The VN Index’s 14-day relative strength index, a measure of
market momentum, rose to 71 yesterday, above the 70 threshold
that some traders view as a sign the market is poised to drop.  Vietnam’s  gross domestic product  expanded 4.89 percent in
the first three months of the year from the same period a year
earlier, the General Statistics Office said on March 27,
compared with the 5.2 percent median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
