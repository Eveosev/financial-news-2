The author Iain Banks said he is
terminally ill and the novel he is writing is likely to be his
last because he is expected to live for only “several months.”  Banks, 59, whose books include “The Wasp Factory,” “The
Crow Road” and “Stonemouth,” said he has cancer.  “It started in my gall bladder, has infected both lobes of
my liver and probably also my pancreas and some lymph nodes,
plus one tumour is massed around a group of major blood vessels
in the same volume, effectively ruling out any chance of
surgery,” Banks said in a statement on his website.  “The bottom line, now, I’m afraid, is that as a late stage
gall bladder cancer patient, I’m expected to live for ’several
months’ and it’s extremely unlikely I’ll live beyond a year. So
it looks like my latest novel, ‘The Quarry,’ will be my last.  “As a result, I’ve withdrawn from all planned public
engagements and I’ve asked my partner Adele if she will do me
the honour of becoming my widow (sorry -- but we find ghoulish
humour helps). By the time this goes out we’ll be married and on
a short honeymoon,” he said.  The Scottish author, who also writes science fiction under
the name Iain M. Banks, said he first became aware he was unwell
when he developed back pain in late January.  (Richard Vines writes for Muse, the arts and leisure
