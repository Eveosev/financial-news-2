Nadia Santini, the matriarch at Dal
Pescatore in Mantua, Italy, was today named as Best Female Chef
in the  World’s 50 Best Restaurants  awards.  Santini had never cooked professionally when she entered
the kitchen of her husband Antonio’s family in 1974. About 22
years later, she was the first woman in Italy to be awarded
three Michelin stars. Antonio now manages the front of house.  “Nadia Santini’s cheffing expertise has lifted the
restaurant to the highest of heights,” the World’s 50 Best
Restaurants said today in an e-mailed release. The winning
establishments will be announced in London on April 29.  When Santini joined the restaurant, it was run by her
husband’s grandmother, Teresa, and his parents, Giovanni and
Bruna. Santini’s sons Alberto and Giovanni work there now.  Last year’s winner was  Elena Arzak , the fourth generation
of her family to head Arzak restaurant since it opened in 1897.
Arzak is located in San Sebastian, Spain. the Best Female Chef
is sponsored by Veuve Clicquot.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
