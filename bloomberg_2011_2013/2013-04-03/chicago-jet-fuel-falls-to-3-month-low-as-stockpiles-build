Chicago   jet fuel  weakened versus
futures to the  lowest level  in almost three months as
 inventories  of the areaâ€™s aviation fuel grew. Gasoline in the
region also declined.  Stockpiles of jet fuel in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
increased 36,000 barrels to  7.45 million  in the week ended March
29, the third consecutive weekly gain, according to Energy
Information Administration data compiled by Bloomberg.  No. 54 jet fuel  in Chicago slid 1.5 cents to a premium of 2
cents to futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:34
p.m., the narrowest differential since Jan. 7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The same fuel fell 1 cent to  3.5 cents 
above futures in the Group 3, or Midcontinent, area.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline in Chicago, or CBOB,
weakened 2 cents to 26 cents below Nymex futures. Stockpiles of
motor fuel in the region gained 257,000 barrels to 53.5 million
last week, EIA data show.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a measure of refining
profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , fell to $22.87 a barrel, the lowest level since Jan.
25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
