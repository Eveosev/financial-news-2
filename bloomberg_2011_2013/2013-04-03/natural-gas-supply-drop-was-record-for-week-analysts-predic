Natural gas inventories ended March
with a record decline as a cold snap boosted demand for the
heating fuel, analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stockpiles fell 92 billion cubic feet to 1.69 trillion in
the seven days ended March 29, based on the median of 18
estimates. That would be the  largest drop  on record for the time
of year, according to data from the Energy Information
Administration. The five-year average stockpile change for the
period is an increase of 4 billion. Last year, supplies rose by
43 billion during that week.  Stockpile estimates ranged from decreases of 79 billion to
100 billion cubic feet. The EIA’s weekly supply report is
scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Temperatures were below normal in the eastern two-thirds of
the contiguous 48 states last week, according to MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Gas futures jumped to an
intraday high of $4.121 per million British thermal units on
March 28, the most since September 2011, as a year-over-year
supply  deficit  widened to a record 27 percent.  “Prices may still have another leg higher in them,”  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC and editor of the Energy
OverView newsletter in  New York , wrote today. “We had projected
that prices would top out above $4.20, but the fierce rejection
of $4.12 calls that view into question. The inventory report
tomorrow will be critical to whether or not to bail on that
call.”  Natural gas futures this week have fallen 12.4 cents, or
3.1 percent, to $3.90 per million British thermal units on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , heading for the first weekly
decline since Feb. 15. Prices are up 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
