Hong Kong   stocks  swung between gains
and losses amid speculation valuations have become more
attractive after the city’s benchmark index declined in the past
two months.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world’s
largest lender by market value, added 0.2 percent after
announcing plans to buy 20 percent in  Taiwan ’s Bank Sinopac.
 Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. (1929) , a Hong Kong-based chain with
more revenue than Tiffany & Co., rose 1.9 percent after retail
sales in the city increased more than economists estimated.
Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil producer, slid 0.9
percent as crude futures fell.  The Hang Seng Index gained 0.1 percent to 22,389.12 as of
10:53 a.m. in Hong Kong after rising as much as 0.7 percent and
falling 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index fell
0.2 percent to 10,789.50, after rising 0.7 percent earlier. The
benchmark Hang Seng Index has fallen the past two months amid
concern China will step up measures to curb property prices and
that Cyprus’s banking woes will reignite  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “While valuations are looking attractive, equity risk
premium remain high,” said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of
Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd.,
which oversees about $51 billion. “For the rally to be
sustained, we need to see more growth surprises from China.
Growth in China isn’t going to surprise on the upside as the new
leadership is very focused on managing inflation.”  Volume on the benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  was about 22
percent below the 30-day intraday average for the time of day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares on the gauge
traded at 10.8 times estimated earnings, compared with 14.2 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
