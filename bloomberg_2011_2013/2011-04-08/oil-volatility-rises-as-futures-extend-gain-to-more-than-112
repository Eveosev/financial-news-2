Oil options volatility rose as the
underlying front-month futures rose above $112 a barrel in  New
York  for the first time in 30 months on skepticism that Libyan
output will rebound when fighting ends.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 31.8 percent as of 4 p.m. in New York, up
from 29.7 percent yesterday.  Oil for May delivery gained $2.49, or 2.3 percent, to
$112.79 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since Sept. 22, 2008. Prices advanced 4.5
percent this week and are up 32 percent from a year ago. June
futures rose $2.49, or 2.3 percent, to $113.37.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
May $120 calls with 3,441 lots changing hands. They gained 15
cents to 28 cents a barrel. May $115 calls, the next-most active
contract, rose 57 cents to 97 cents a barrel with 2,453
contracts trading. The seven most active options were calls. One
contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  May options expire in less than a week, on April 14.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  May $120 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 6,044 lots changing hands. They increased 3
cents to 13 cents a barrel. The next most active option, June
$90 puts, were unchanged from yesterday at 17 cents a barrel on
5,894 lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
41,238 contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 40,518 and
June $150 calls with 40,194.  To contact the reporter on this story:
