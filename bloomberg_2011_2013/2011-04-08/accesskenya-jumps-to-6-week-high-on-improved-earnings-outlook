AccessKenya (ACCESS)  Group Ltd., the nation’s
only publicly traded Internet company, extended its longest
winning streak in nine months on an improved earnings outlook
for the financial year through December 2010.  The stock rallied for a seventh day, adding 60 cents, or
6.2 percent, to 10.35 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi,
the highest since Feb. 22. The increase pared the stock’s drop
this year to 23 percent.  The company on March 23 reported a loss of 7.95 million
shillings ($94,000) for the year through December compared with
a profit a year earlier.  It’s expected to return to profit in the current financial
year, Genghis Capital Ltd. said, citing AccessKenya management.
Profit will probably be 200 million shillings in the 12 months
through December 2011, the Nairobi-based brokerage said in an e-
mailed note today.  “They retained their market share at 40 percent” even as
the company reported a loss, Timothy Wambu, a research analyst
at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Financial Services Ltd., said in a
phone interview today. “They have reduced capital expenditure
and streamlined administrative costs, which should be good for
future  cash flow .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
