Gold rose, setting a record for the
fourth time this week, as a weakening dollar boosted demand for
the precious metal as an alternative asset and an inflation
hedge. Silver climbed above $40 an ounce to a 31-year high.  Gold rose to $1,476.40 an ounce in  New York , the highest
ever, after the dollar slid to the lowest level since December
2009 against a basket of six major currencies. Crude oil touched
a 30-month high, and the European Central Bank yesterday raised
borrowing costs from a record low to fight accelerating prices.  “The  Federal Reserve  isn’t anywhere near an inflation
fight as the ECB,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading LLC in  Chicago . “Gold’s move is about the weakness in
the dollar. Inflation is the buzzword, and it’s the impetus
behind the trade.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $16.60, or 1.1 percent,
to $1,475.90 at 4:37 p.m. in after-hours trading on the Comex in
New York. The metal settled up $14.80, or 1 percent, to
$1,474.10 at 1:39 p.m. in floor trading. For the week, the metal
gained 3.2 percent, the most since May. Gold for immediate
delivery in  London  climbed as much as 1.2 percent to a record
$1,475.52.  Silver futures for May delivery advanced $1.056, or 2.7
percent, to settle at $40.608. After the close of regular
trading, the price touched $40.945, the highest since January
1980, the year futures reached a record $50.35. This week,
silver advanced 7.6 percent, the most since February.  The difference between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader
expectations for inflation, widened to as much as 2.64
percentage points, the most since March 2008. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities rose to the
highest since September 2008, led by gains in cotton.  ECB Raises Rates  The Fed has kept the benchmark rate at zero percent to 0.25
percent since December 2008 to stimulate growth. The ECB
yesterday raised the main interest rate 25 basis points to 1.25
percent.  “We just don’t hear anything about an inflation fight from
the Fed,” Lesh said. “The Fed needs to move back to a neutral
policy before they can even think of fighting inflation.”  Gold extended gains after Congress and the President failed
to agree on a federal budget. The dollar fell as much as 1
percent against the basket of currencies.  “With the weakness in the dollar, the market is jittery
about holding paper currencies and gravitating to the metals,”
said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-
Waldock in Chicago. “The price of the metals reflects the chaos
that will result from a lack of leadership from our
Congressional leaders.”  Gold Over Dollars  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, advised clients to sell sterling
and buy gold. Earlier this week, Gartman encouraged investors to
sell Japanese equities and buy the precious metal.  “With the monetary base skyrocketing, and with the  U.S.
dollar  falling, gold has to move higher,” Gartman said.  Silver held in exchange-traded products rose 27.57 metric
tons to 15,423.09 tons yesterday, the highest level since at
least February 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg from four
providers show.  Investors perceive silver as “a cheap vehicle with
characteristics similar to gold as a store of value,” Morgan
Stanley said in a report to clients today. The metal will
average $31.39 this year, up 20 percent from a previous
forecast, the bank said.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $13.95, or 1.8
percent, to $794.20 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after touching a one-month high of $804. Platinum
futures for July delivery gained $21.50, or 1.2 percent, to
$1,812.10 an ounce on the Nymex. Earlier, the price reached
$1,822.10, the highest since March 7.  Palladium rose 2.5 percent this week while platinum gained
2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
