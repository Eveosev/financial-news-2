Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day as the dollar weakened on speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve will trail other central banks in raising
 interest rates .  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
as much as 0.7 percent to 83.75 per dollar and was trading at
84.11 at 5:34 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. It closed at 84.30
yesterday.  “The local unit gained against the dollar, mirroring the
gain by the euro following yesterday’s decision by the  European
Central Bank  to raise the euro rate by 25 basis points,” Steve
Lagat, a trader at Nairobi-based CfC Stanbic Bank Ltd., said in
a phone interview today.  The ECB’s decision to raise its main rate comes as the
central banks of other developed nations, including the U.S. and
 Japan , keep borrowing costs near zero to support their economies
as they recover from the financial crisis. The Fed isn’t
expected to raise its target funds rate until the first quarter
of 2012 and the Bank of Japan will probably keep borrowing costs
on hold for the next 12 months, the median estimates in two
Bloomberg surveys show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
