The  International Monetary Fund 
started discussions on how to allocate $2.79 billion of windfall
profit from gold sales, considering three options.  The gold sales, which were initiated in October 2009 and
ended in December 2010, generated more profit than expected
because of higher than anticipated gold prices, the IMF said.  The institution agreed in September 2009 to dispose of
403.3 metric tons of bullion as part of a plan to shore up its
finances and lend at reduced rates to low-income countries. More
than half of the gold amount was acquired by the central banks
of  India , Mauritius,  Sri Lanka  and Bangladesh, according to past
announcements.  Many executive directors on the IMF board supported using
the extra profit for lending at lower rates, the IMF said. Many
also backed putting it toward the fundâ€™s precautionary balances
or putting it in the endowment, where most of the profit is
already going to go, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
