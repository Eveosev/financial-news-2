Moody’s Investors Service said its
action on  Bulgaria ’s government rating, which was placed on
review for upgrade on April 5, is unlikely to have an impact on
the ratings of the four rated Bulgarian banks.  The deposit ratings of the banks are unaffected by the
sovereign action as the ratings do not incorporate any rating
uplift from systemic support, the rating company said. The
Bulgarian government’s ability to support the banking system is
constrained by limitations arising from the country’s currency-
board regime.  “Although the government’s finances are improving, the
operating environment for the banks continues to remain
challenging, with limited credit growth and continued increases
in non-performing loans,” Moody’s said. “Although most of the
banks remain profitable and have strong capital buffers to
absorb credit losses, the cost of risk has increased and
provisioning expenses have risen, pressuring the banks’ net
profits.”  The four banks are DSK Bank, a unit of OTP Bank Nyrt,
Raiffeisenbank Bulgaria EAD; Corporate Commercial Bank and
International Asset Bank AD.  Bulgaria’s Baa3 rating, the lowest investment grade with
 Hungary ,  Croatia ,  Romania  and Latvia, has been in effect since
March 1, 2006, nine months before it joined the European Union.  Editors: James M. Gomez  To contact the reporters on this story:
