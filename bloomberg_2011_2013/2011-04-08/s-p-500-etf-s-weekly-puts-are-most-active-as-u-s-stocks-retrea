Weekly put options to sell an
exchange-traded fund tracking the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
were the most-active contracts as investors boosted bets that
the security will extend losses before they expire today.  More than 89,000 of the $133 puts on the SPDR  S&P 500  ETF
changed hands as of 1:20 p.m. in New York as the fund slumped
0.1 percent to $133.20. Trading volume was double the open
interest of 40,423 outstanding contracts before today.  “Investors might be taking positions in anticipation of
equity market weakness this afternoon on concerns about a
looming government shutdown,” Frederic Ruffy, a senior options
strategist at WhatsTrading.com, a New York-based provider of
options-market analytics, wrote in a report.  Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress remain
divided over a budget, hours away from the first U.S. government
shutdown in 15 years. Democratic leaders say Republicans are
refusing to accept federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
Republicans say the dividing issue is spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
