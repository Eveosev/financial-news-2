Tank Intermediate Holding Corp. will
pay lenders 3.75 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate for a $265 million  term loan , according
to a person with knowledge of the deal.  The interest rate on the loan will step down to 3.5
percentage points more than Libor when leverage is less than
3.25 times, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. Leverage is the measure of debt
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization.  The debt will have a 1.25 percent Libor floor and will be
sold at 99.75 cents on the dollar, the person said.  The loan had initial price guidance of 3.5 percentage
points to 4 percentage points more than Libor with a 1.25
percent to 1.5 percent floor on the benchmark, the person said.
It was initially offered for 99 cents to 99.5 cents, the person
said. Libor is a rate banks charge to lend to each other.  The financing, which also includes a $20 million revolving
line of credit, is being used to refinance debt. GE Capital
Markets, the lending unit of  General Electric Co. (GE) , is arranging
the loans, the person said. Olympus Partners, a Stamford,
Connecticut-based private-equity firm owns Tank Intermediate,
which is a designer and manufacturer of plastic and steel
storage tanks.  Manu Bettegowda, an Olympus partner, said the deal is
expected to close on April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
