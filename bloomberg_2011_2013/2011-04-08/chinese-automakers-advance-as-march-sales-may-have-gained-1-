SAIC Motor Corp.,  China ’s largest
carmaker, led gains by Chinese automakers on speculation sales
increased last month.  SAIC Motor jumped 8.2 percent to 19.90 yuan at the 3 p.m.
close in Shanghai, the highest since Nov. 9. FAW Car Co., which
makes passenger cars in China with Volkswagen AG, gained 4.8
percent to 17.18 yuan. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
rose 0.7 percent.  “Historically, March has always been one of the months
with the highest car sales,” said Han Weiqi, an analyst at CSC
International Holdings Ltd. in Shanghai. “That’s as businesses
start planning for and buying new cars after Chinese New Year
ends, and also as consumers make auto purchases before the April
and May long weekends.” Han estimated a 10 percent increase in
auto sales last month from a year ago.  The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers is
scheduled to release March auto sales figures over the weekend.
Sales increased 2.6 percent in February, the slowest pace in
more than two years, the association said last month.  Preliminary data showed sales rose in March. Passenger-car
sales increased 8 percent from a year earlier to 1.24 million
units, China’s Passenger Car Association said today in a
statement on their website.  The CPCA numbers are separate from those provided by the
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, which is the only
automobile trade organization registered with the Chinese
government.  March Sales  “March auto sales continued the growth trend in March,”
said Zhang Xin, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. in
Beijing. “The month-on-month growth rate is very significant
given the lower base due to the holidays in February.”  SAIC Motor resumed trading this week after a suspension of
almost two months. The automaker said on April 6 it plans to buy
partsmakers and other businesses from its parent for 32 billion
yuan ($4.9 billion) in stock to gain control of supplies and
speed development of new models.  “For SAIC, there’s also speculation that the company will
benefit from the plan on hybrid car development, which would add
to its profits,” said Guotai’s Zhang.  Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., a unit of China’s biggest
light-truck exporter, jumped 5.7 percent to 13.27 yuan.
Jiangling Motors Corp., the Chinese commercial vehicle partner
with Ford Motor Co., climbed 2.3 percent to 33.40 yuan.  --Zhang Shidong, Liza Lin and Irene Shen. Editor: Reinie Booysen  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
