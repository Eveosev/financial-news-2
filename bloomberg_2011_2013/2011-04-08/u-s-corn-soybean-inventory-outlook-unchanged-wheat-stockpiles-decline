The government’s estimate of U.S.
corn inventories before this year’s harvest was left unchanged
at the lowest since 1996, surprising analysts who expected
demand for ethanol and animal feed to further erode supplies.  Stockpiles on Sept. 1 will total 675 million bushels (17.14
million metric tons), down from 1.708 billion bushels a year
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
report. Analysts expected 589 million bushels, on average. Corn
futures have more than doubled in the past year in Chicago
because of rising demand. The soybean-surplus estimate was also
unchanged, while wheat inventories were projected to decline.  “It gets kind of scary, from the standpoint of how tight
the supply currently is,” said  Christian Mayer , a market
analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments Co. in  Minneapolis .
“Something has got to change. Either end-users have to slow
down on demand, or use something else” as a substitute for
corn, he said.  Global food prices reached a record in February and pared
gains in March, according to the  United Nations . High food costs
and corruption have spurred unrest across the Middle East and
northern  Africa , ousting leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt , the
world’s biggest wheat importer. The U.S. is the largest exporter
of corn, soybeans and wheat.  Record Ethanol Use  The amount of corn used for ethanol will be a record 5
billion bushels, up from 4.95 billion estimated last month, the
USDA said. Feed use will be 5.15 billion bushels, down from 5.2
billion projected in March, while up from 5.14 billion bushels
in the previous year, the USDA said.  World corn inventories will total 122.43 million tons at
the end of this marketing year, down 0.6 percent from last
month’s estimate, the USDA said.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 9 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to settle at $7.68 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Yesterday, the commodity touched $7.7325, the highest since July
2008. Corn reached a record $7.9925 on June 27, 2008.  The U.S. soybean supply on Aug. 31 will be 140 million
bushels, unchanged from last month, the USDA said. Analysts
expected 136 million bushels. Soybean export sales for the
current marketing year dropped last week to the lowest since
early February.  Falling Soybean Demand  Demand for U.S. soybeans has fallen on the “combination of
competition from  South America  and  China  trying to slow its
usage,” said Alan Brugler, the president of Brugler Marketing &
Management LLC in Omaha,  Nebraska . The USDA raised its crop
estimate for Brazil, the second largest soybean exporter, to a
record 72 million metric tons from 70 million last month.  Brazil  harvests its crop from March to May.  World soybean inventories may rise to 60.94 million metric
tons, compared with last month’s forecast of 58.33 million and
pre-report analyst estimates of 58.42 million, the USDA said.  Soybean futures for May delivery climbed 28.75 cents, or
2.1 percent, to settle at $13.9225 a bushel in Chicago.  U.S. wheat stockpiles at the end of the marketing year on
May 31 may fall to 839 million bushels (22.94 million tons),
compared with 843 million estimated last month and supplies last
year of 976 million, the USDA said. World wheat inventories may
rise to 182.83 million tons, compared with 181.9 million
estimated last month and stockpiles of 197.91 million at the end
of last year.  Wheat futures for July delivery gained 23.25 cents, or 2.9
percent, to settle at $8.3225 a bushel. The price is up 72
percent in the past year as  Russia  banned exports after the
country’s worst drought in a half-century.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show. Wheat ranks fourth at $13 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporters on this story:
