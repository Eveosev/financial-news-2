Latvian consumer prices rose an
annual 4.2 percent in March, the quickest pace in 22 months,
after the government increased taxes and the cost of fuel and
food advanced.  The result compared with a 4 percent rate in February, the
Riga-based  statistics office  said on its website today. The
median estimate of six economists in a Bloomberg survey was 3.9
percent. On the month, consumer prices grew 0.7 percent.  Inflation is accelerating after the government raised the
value-added tax in January and the Baltic nation’s economy
starts to rebound following deflation of 1.1 percent last year.
Consumer prices may rise more than 4 percent this year, Prime
Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said on the  Latvijas Radio  program
Krustpunkts on April 6.  “We see upside risks to our inflation forecast of around 3
percent year-on-year on average for 2011,” said  Annika
Lindblad , a Helsinki-based analyst with Nordea AB, in an e-mail.
“However, we expect inflation to moderate gradually over the
year as the effects from higher food and energy prices abate.”  Latvia turned to a group led by the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.8
billion) loan in 2008 after the collapse of its second-biggest
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
