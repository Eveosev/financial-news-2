UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s largest bank,
hasn’t reached a final decision on its Pioneer Global Asset
Management unit, after an Italian newspaper reported it scrapped
a possible sale.  “An official decision hasn’t been taken yet,” said Paola di Raimondo, a spokeswoman at Milan-based UniCredit. “The bank is
still reviewing options including keeping Pioneer to relaunch
it, and it is in line with the timetable,” she said.  Natixis SA of Paris, Resolution Ltd. and Amundi, a joint
venture of  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, had
submitted non-binding offers for the unit, people familiar with
the matter have said. UniCredit Chief Executive Officer Federico Ghizzoni said on March 23 the bank would consider keeping
Pioneer if it didn’t attract satisfactory offers.  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported earlier today that the Pioneer sale
was canceled. Officials for  Natixis (KN) , Resolution and Amundi
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
