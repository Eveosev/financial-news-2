Senator  Tom Coburn , an  Oklahoma 
Republican, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that
the budget battle that brought the government to the brink of
shutting down this week is far less important than resolving the
partisan fight over raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt
ceiling this summer.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. Thank you for
being with us, senator.  SENATOR TOM COBURN: Good to be with you.  HUNT: The next big issue, which will be more important than
the current fight, will be over increasing the debt ceiling by
early May. What do you think has to be done in the next month
before the votes will be there to increase the debt ceiling?  COBURN: Well, I’ll tell you, I think it’s going to be later
than that. I think it’s going to be sometime between June 10th
and July 4. That’s how far the secretary has said he can stretch
this thing out. There has to be in this country a plan to solve
our very real and acute fiscal problems.  HUNT: Before the debt ceiling can be increased?  COBURN: Yeah. You’re not going to have the first Republican
vote for that until we have a plan that puts this country on a
glide path to solving its problems. One - one side of that is
 Paul Ryan . One is the deficit commission. But the fact is,
neither of those go to where we really need to go to stabilize
us. They’re steps towards that.  HUNT: We’re going to get to both of those in a minute, but
almost everybody agrees with you there’s a long-term problem.
There may be disagreement on how to solve it. But there doesn’t
appear to be a short-term problem, if you listen to the markets.
The cost of borrowing is less than it’s been in 20 years. The
 bond market  seems very calm today. Inflationary expectations
aren’t high.  I know you’ve noticed that Pimco is selling its Treasury
bills, but short term, there isn’t any crisis. So isn’t it
better to take -  (CROSSTALK)  COBURN: Oh, I disagree.  HUNT: You do?  COBURN: You know, when you - when you see bonds go down in
price nine days in a row, the signal has been sent that people
lack confidence and that we’re going to see an increase in
 interest rates . For every 1 percent increase in interest rates,
we’re going to spend $150 billion, which complicates the very
problem that we’re having discussions about today at the -
between the president and the leaders. Another $150 billion and
we can’t cut $60 billion or $70 billion? I mean, this is an
exponential - this is a problem that could exponentially cripple
us.  You know, a 2 percent increase in real interest rates for
our debt over the next year costs $300 billion. And I think it’s
acute.  HUNT: You don’t think -  COBURN: Well, I think everybody is looking at that, but
that’s because you got QE2 out there, and you’ve got the Federal
Reserve buying 70 percent of all the bonds we issue. You know,
that is a real problem, because what they’re doing is they’re
debasing the currency, which will result in significant
inflation, and that’s a tax increase on every middle-income
family and every poor person in this country, a significant tax
increase.  HUNT: Senator, you mentioned your Republican colleague,
Paul Ryan, and you have praised his effort at a long-term
budget, has no Democratic support. It’s not possible to enact
anything on a partisan basis, is it?  COBURN: Well, it may be if the problems get acute and
quickly. The point is, my problem with my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle is, where’s your plan? Here’s a guy that
stood out, put his chin out there, and said, “Here’s the real
problems. Here’s my solution for them.” I would caution my
colleagues to not be critical until they put one up of their
own.  HUNT: Well, one plan that is out there is one that you
voted for, the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction commission. Even
your liberal colleague,  Dick Durbin , also joined you. He
swallowed his reservations about entitlements; you swallowed
your reservations about tax increases to get some kind of a
deal. Is Simpson-Bowles going to be the outline of something
that has to be -  COBURN: I can’t - I don’t know that.  HUNT: What do you think?  COBURN: I don’t - I don’t know the answer to it.  HUNT:  Grover Norquist  says it’s awful, no Republican should
vote for it because it’s a tax increase.  COBURN: Well, there’s not tax increases in there. What
there is, is revenue growth that are based on reforming and
broadening the base of the  tax code  and eliminating tax
expenditures like lenders’ credit for ethanol.  HUNT: Right.  COBURN: We have $1.3 trillion a year in tax expenditures,
of which $400 billion, $500 billion is for the very low-income
in this country, so you have $700 billion that you could work
for.  HUNT: You won’t predict whether Simpson-Bowles would pass,
because you said you don’t know, but you’re part of the Gang of
Six, the Gang of Eight, whatever - a bipartisan group of
senators that have seriously been working on this.  COBURN: Yeah, and it’s very hard.  HUNT: It’s very hard. Do you feel that you are on the way
to success, or do you think it’s -  COBURN: I can’t tell you that yet. We’ve still got a couple
of hard issues that we’ve not been able to -  HUNT: What’s the hardest issue?  COBURN: Well, Al, we just don’t talk about what our
conflicts are.  HUNT: You have passionately fought against the ethanol
subsidies, ethanol tax breaks. You postponed action on the
small-business bill and that provision. Some of your Republican
conservative colleagues, Chuck Grassley, John Thune, fighting
you on this. Are you going to get a vote on ethanol, and do you
have a chance of winning it?  COBURN: I will eventually get a vote on this, and, yes, I
will win.  HUNT: You will win on the Senate floor?  COBURN: Yeah. Now, it may not be on this bill. If the
leader pulls the bill, I won’t have an option. But it’s - the
one thing  Harry Reid  knows is, if I’m going to get an amendment
voted on, I’m going to get -  HUNT: This year you’re going to win that?  COBURN: I will win that.  HUNT: One of the really unusual relationships in
 Washington , D.C., a town that’s marked by partisanship and
personal bitterness and all of that, is Tom Coburn and Barack
Obama, conservative, Oklahoma, white physician, a liberal,
Chicago African-American, community activist, you talk to him as
much as almost any other senator. What have you told him
recently about some of these big issues like Simpson-Bowles and
-  COBURN: Well, our relationship is more personal. And I try
not to tell him anything unless he asks me.  HUNT: Has he asked you anything recently?  COBURN: Well, not in the last two weeks or three weeks,
but, you know, he was happy to see my vote on the Simpson-Bowles
commission. He’s always knocking me because I won’t give him
enough votes. I mean, he always chides me on it.  HUNT: Well, for all of your differences - and they are
profound, with  Barack Obama  - why is there this personal
chemistry?  COBURN: I just think we truly like each other. We met when
we both came into the Senate. He’s got a wonderful personality.
He’s got a great wife and family. He is a very neat man, and I
like him personally. You know, we are polar opposites.  HUNT: Right.  COBURN: But, you know, both of us are a product of our life
experience. I mean, he came up one way, and I came up totally
different, and I see things from a different perspective. That
doesn’t make him a bad man. And, you know, the whole idea is,
you can’t change anybody you can’t - don’t love. If you don’t
love them, you can’t change them.  And so my goal would be, I love the man. I think he’s a
neat man. I don’t want him to be president, but I still love
him. He is our president. He’s my president. And I disagree with
him adamantly on 95 percent of the issues, but that doesn’t mean
I can’t have a great relationship. And that’s a model people
ought to follow.  HUNT: Senator, thank you so much for being with us.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
