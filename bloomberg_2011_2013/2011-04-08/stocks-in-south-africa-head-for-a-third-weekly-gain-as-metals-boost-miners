South African stocks climbed,
heading for a third week of gains as copper reached a one-month
high, boosting  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  and  Anglo American Plc. (AGL)   The FTSE/JSE All Share Index added 0.9 percent to 32,914.2
at 9:31 a.m. in Johannesburg, reversing yesterday’s 0.8 percent
loss and taking the week’s gain to 1.6 percent.  BHP Billiton ,
the world’s biggest mining company, climbed to the highest in a
month, adding 1.6 percent to 279.40 rand. Anglo American, which
comprises 11 percent of the gauge, gained the most since April
4, advancing 1.3 percent to 357.50 rand.  Copper rallied for a fourth day and zinc climbed to a one-
month high on optimism global economic growth will sustain
demand for industrial metals. Lead advanced to the highest level
in three years and aluminum reached the highest price since
September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
