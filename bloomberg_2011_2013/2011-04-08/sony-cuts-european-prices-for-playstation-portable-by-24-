Sony Corp. (6758) , the world’s largest
exporter of consumer electronics, cut European prices for its
 PlayStation Portable  video-game player by 24 percent.  The PSP player will have a suggested retail price of 129.99
euros ($187.29) beginning today, Sony Computer Entertainment
Inc. said in a  statement  on its website. The price was  cut to
$129.99 in the U.S.  in February.  “The price cut is aimed at increasing adoption of the
player in  Europe ,” said Satoshi Fukuoka, a Tokyo-based
spokesman at Sony’s video-games unit. The previous suggested
retail price was 169.99 euros.  Sony, based in Tokyo, competes with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , maker
of the Xbox, and Nintendo Co. in the gaming market. Sony may
stagger the global release of its next-generation PlayStation
Portable game machine, codenamed NGP, after the earthquake and
tsunami that hit  Japan  last month disrupted production.  The new PlayStation Portable may be introduced in a single
region this year, rather than starting in multiple markets in
time for the end-of-year  holiday shopping season , Jack Tretton,
president of Sony Computer Entertainment of America, said April
5. He declined to say which region may offer the device first.  To contact the reporters on this story:
