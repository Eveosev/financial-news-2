Rupinder Sidhu, a management
consultant, pleaded not guilty to 23 counts of  insider trading 
and one count of money laundering at a London court.  Sidhu is charged with dealing in securities of companies
such as  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , Swatch Group AG, Reed Elsevier
Plc and Michael Page International Plc, while knowing London
hedge fund AKO Capital LLP, planned transactions in the same
shares, according to the indictment. The trades took place in
2008 and 2009.  Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said the trial should start on
November 28. It’s scheduled to last as long as three weeks. The
U.K’s Financial Services Authority  brought the case .  The FSA, which hadn’t prosecuted a case of insider trading
until 2008, is currently prosecuting 12 other individuals for
the crime and has won 10 convictions.  The regulator in February secured the longest-ever U.K.
sentence for insider dealing when former Dresdner Kleinwort
banker Christian Littlewood was imprisoned for 40 months. He
admitted illegally trading over a 10-year period, along with his
wife and an accomplice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
