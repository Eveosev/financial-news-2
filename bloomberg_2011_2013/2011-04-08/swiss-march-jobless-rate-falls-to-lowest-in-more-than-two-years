Swiss unemployment declined to the
lowest in more than two years in March as companies kept adding
workers to meet global demand for the country’s products.  The jobless rate declined to 3.3 percent when adjusted for
seasonal swings from 3.4 percent in February, the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern said in an e-mailed
statement today. That’s the lowest since March 2009 and in line
with the median forecast of seven economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The unadjusted jobless rate fell to 3.4 percent from 3.6
percent in February. The number of job openings increased by
1,035 to 21,999 in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
