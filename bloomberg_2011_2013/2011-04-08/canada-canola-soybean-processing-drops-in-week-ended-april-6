Canadian mills processed 13 percent
less canola and 13 percent fewer soybeans in the week ended
April 6 from a week earlier, an industry group said.  Mills crushed 108,666 metric tons of canola, also called
rapeseed, and 25,072 tons of soybeans, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-
based Canadian Oilseed Processors Association said today in an
e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
