Congress should pass legislation
extending the July deadline under the Dodd-Frank Act for most
new derivatives regulations to be completed, 19 industry trade-
associations told lawmakers.  The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  and
 Securities and Exchange Commission  need “sufficient time to
develop a transparent and orderly system that minimizes
unintended consequences,” the associations wrote today to the
top Democrats and Republicans on the Financial Services and
Agriculture committees in the House and the Agriculture and
Banking committees in the Senate.  The associations, including the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce ,
 American Petroleum Institute  and  Business Roundtable , said
adopting regulations requiring margin payments “under the
exigency of a looming deadline is both shortsighted and
potentially damaging.”  Gary Gensler , CFTC chairman, said the agency will miss some
of the mid-July deadlines. The CFTC plans to divide the rules
into three groups, with some rules slated for adoption later in
the summer or fall, Gensler said March 16.  “I don’t think Congress needs to push back the date,”
Gensler told House lawmakers on March 31. “You’ve already given
us great latitude to phase the implementation dates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
