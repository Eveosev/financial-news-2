Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corp. (4188) 
plans to restart the No. 2 naphtha cracker at its Kashima plant
on May 20, chemicals and pricing service ICIS said today, citing
an unidentified person at  Japan ’s biggest ethylene maker.  Kashima’s No. 2 cracker, which shut after last month’s
earthquake, can process 453,000 metric tons a year, ICIS said.
The plant’s No. 1 cracker, which can process 375,000 tons a
year, will undergo maintenance until June 27, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
