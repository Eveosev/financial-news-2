Hungary ’s monthly trade surplus
swelled to a record in February, driven by surging exports to
European Union countries including  Germany .  The surplus was 816.4 million euros ($1.2 billion),
compared with 400.8 million euros in January and the 515.5
million-euro estimate of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg,
the statistics office in Budapest said in an e-mailed statement
today. Exports rose an annual 26.8 percent in euro terms, while
imports advanced 20.3 percent.  Hungary is looking to the euro region, which buys 60
percent of products made or assembled in Hungary including Audi
AG cars and Nokia Oyj phones, to support a recovery from its
worst recession in 18 years. The government wants to boost
economic growth to between 4 percent and 6 percent a year to
help meet its goal of creating a million jobs in a decade.  “It is still clearly visible that growth is led by exports
and the strong external demand,”  Gyorgy Barta , a Budapest-based
economist at CIB Bank Zrt., Intesa Sanpaolo SpA’s Hungarian
unit, said in an e-mail. “The figures should be boosted further
by the launch of automotive production capacities next year and
the return of unused capacities in other categories.”  Forint Gains  The forint gained 0.3 percent to trade at 263.69 per euro
at 9:25 a.m. in Budapest, its biggest increase in seven days as
the data was a record since Bloomberg began tracking trade
figures in January, 2001. The currency is the world’s best
performer this year, having gained 5.7 percent against  Europe ’s
common currency.  The government will spend a total of 16.7 billion forint
($90.3 million) to subsidize the expansion of existing plants by
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi unit and  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel
division, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said on April 6.  Audi will get 11.2 billion forint for its 900 million-euro
($1.3 billion) spending program while Opel will get 5.5 billion
forint for its 450 million-euro investment.  February industrial production advanced a workday-adjusted
14.3 percent from a year, the fastest in three months, Hungary’s
 statistics office  said in a preliminary report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
