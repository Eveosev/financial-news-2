Aid for  Portugal  will be tied to
“strict conditions,” Klaus-Peter Flosbach, finance policy
spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s bloc in
parliament, was cited as saying in  Handelsblatt  newspaper.  “Without a reduction of refinancing costs and severe
structural reforms, Portugal won’t return to permanent debt
sustainability,” Flosbach was quoted as saying. He also said
that it wasn’t the right time to discuss a restructuring of
Greek debt because fiscal reforms take time to show an effect,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
