Burundian authorities detained two
anti-corruption activists at a peaceful protest held in the
capital, Bujumbura, to mark the second anniversary of the death
of a campaigner against graft,  Human Rights Watch  said.  Gabriel Rufyiri, head of the  Anti-corruption and Economic
Malpractice Observatory , or Olucome, and colleague Claver
Irambona were arrested, and police shut down today’s rally, the
New York-based advocacy group said in an e-mailed statement.  Ernest Manirumva, who was vice president of Olucome, was
found stabbed to death outside his home in Bujumbura in April
2009. He had been investigating allegations of police corruption
and illegal weapons trafficking, Human Rights Watch said.  Burundi hasn’t followed the recommendations of a U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation-assisted inquiry that several
high-ranking police officers should undergo questioning and give
DNA evidence in the case, according to Human Rights Watch.  The demonstrators had defied a decision late yesterday by
east African nation’s Public Security Ministry to bar today’s
protest. The ministry had overturned the Interior Ministry’s
permission for the rally to take place,  Human Rights Watch  said.  “The Burundian government doesn’t have a history of
tolerating peaceful protests,” the group said. “The government
is doing everything they can to stop people from highlighting
the lack of justice.”  Three calls seeking comment from the government’s public
relations office weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
