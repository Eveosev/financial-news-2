Indian shares fell for the fourth
day, paring a weekly advance, on concern higher energy prices
will fan inflation.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nationâ€™s biggest lender, declined
for the first time this week. Oil rose above $111 a barrel in
 New York  and surpassed $124 in  London  for the first time since
2008.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest truckmaker and owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, dropped the most in a month.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
135.47, or 0.7 percent, to 19,455.71, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge is still set
for a third week of gains. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the
National Stock Exchange lost 0.7 percent to 5,845, and its April
futures settled at 5,859.3. The BSE 200 Index lost 0.9 percent
to 2,403.23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
