Canada ’s dollar headed toward its
third straight weekly increase against its U.S. counterpart as
crude oil, the nation’s largest export, rose above $113 a barrel
for the first time since 2008.  Canada’s currency pared gains after a government report
showed the economy unexpectedly lost jobs for the first time in
six months in March. Oil rose as a fire burned at  Libya ’s Sarir
field, bolstering concern that unrest in the region will further
reduce supply. The  U.S. dollar  weakened against 15 of its 16
most-traded peers. Global stocks gained.  “This confirms that the Canadian economy is well, given
the persistent rise in  oil prices ,”  Kathy Lien , director of
currency research with online currency trader GFT Forex in  New
York . “The employment details were much more positive for the
Canadian dollar than the headline numbers suggested.”  The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, gained 0.3 percent to 95.54
cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.82 cents
yesterday and 96.32 percent April 1. It touched 95.27 cents, the
strongest since 2007. One Canadian dollar buys C$1.0467.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 2.6 percent to $113.14 a
barrel in New York. It touched $113.21 a barrel, the highest
since September 2008. Gold for June delivery surged to a record
$1476.80 an ounce.  Raw Materials  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of  raw materials 
gained for the seventh consecutive day, increasing 1.2 percent.  Raw materials, including oil and gold, account for about
half of Canada’s export revenue.  The MSCI World Index increased 0.5 percent, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent after earlier
gaining as much as 0.5 percent.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against six of its major trading partners
including the Canadian dollar, fell to as low as 74.848, the
lowest level since December 2009.  “Equity markets are up, the U.S. dollar is weak and
commodities are booming, which is a formula for Canadian dollar
strength,” said Steven Englander, head of Group of 10 currency
strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “Canada’s data numbers
are the second story.”  The loonie fell 1.1 percent during the past month in the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a measure of
the 10 developed-nation currencies. The greenback lost 2.9
percent.  Employment fell by 1,500 last month,  Statistics Canada  said
today in Ottawa. The number was lower than forecast by all 25
economists in a Bloomberg News survey that had a median estimate
of a 28,000 gain. The  unemployment rate  declined to 7.7 percent
from 7.8 percent as predicted, as the  labor force  shrank by
14,900 people.  Canada’s dollar remained higher after the report as
investors focused on the 90,600 gain in full-time work, the
biggest since September 2009. The increase almost matched the
92,100 drop in part-time employment, which was the biggest in
records dating to 1976.  “There’s a broader trend of a weak U.S. dollar so the
market was quick to dismiss Canadian employment,” said  Camilla Sutton , a Bank of Nova Scotia currency strategist in Toronto.  Canadian housing starts rose for a third month in March,
led by projects in rural areas. The annual pace of work on new
homes rose 2.8 percent to 188,800 on a seasonally adjusted basis
from a revised 183,700 the prior month, Canada Mortgage &
Housing Corp. said today in Ottawa.  Government bonds  were little changed, with the benchmark
10-year note yielding 3.44 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent
security maturing in June 2020 dropped 4 cents to C$100.46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
