China ’s benchmark money-market rate
rose the most this month on speculation policy makers will boost
 interest rates  further to help damp inflation.  The People’s Bank of China increased the benchmark one-year
lending rate to 6.31 percent on April 6. The government will
report on April 15 the  consumer price index  rose 5.2 percent
last month from a year earlier, the fastest pace since July 2008,
according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  “The market suspects more monetary tightening will come
after the rate increase this week,” said Shi Lei, head of
fixed-income research at Shenzhen-based Ping An Securities Co.,
a unit of China’s second-largest insurance company. “Inflation
probably won’t improve until the third quarter.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 41 basis points to 2.48 percent as
of 11:28 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the Interbank Funding
Center. The rate gained 20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage
point, this week.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was little
changed at 3.35 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate was 3.34 percent at the end of last week.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due March
2021 fell four basis points to 3.86 percent, according to
Chinabond. The rate dropped two basis points this week.  -- Andrea Wong . Editors: Ven Ram, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
