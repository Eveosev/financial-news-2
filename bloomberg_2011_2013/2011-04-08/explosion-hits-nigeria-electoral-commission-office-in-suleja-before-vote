An explosion hit an office of
 Nigeria ’s electoral commission in the central town of Suleja on
the eve of legislative elections in the West African nation, a
spokesman for the agency said.  The number of casualties wasn’t clear, Kayode Idowu said in
a phone interview from Abuja today.  The blast comes just hours before Nigerians are meant to go
to the polls and choose members of Parliament in the first of a
three-stage general election in  Africa ’s top oil producer.  Suleja, which is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of
the capital, Abuja, was rocked by an attack on March 3 that
killed 10 people when explosives were hurled a rally of the
People’s  Democratic Party .  More than 50 people have died in election-related violence
since July, according to  Amnesty International , while sectarian
clashes in the north have claimed the lives of at least 200
since Dec. 24.  The vote is a prelude to the presidential contest next week
that pits Goodluck Jonathan against 18 rivals, including former
military ruler Muhammadu Buhari and the ex-head of the anti-
graft agency,  Nuhu Ribadu , who is the candidate of the Action
Congress of  Nigeria . On April 26, voters choose the governors
and legislatures of Nigeria’s 36 states.  Nigeria’s Africa’s most populous nation, is the fifth-
largest source of U.S. oil imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
