Malaysia ’s ringgit completed a
weekly gain on speculation the central bank will resume raising
 interest rates  to temper inflation and  Singapore  will tolerate a
stronger currency.  “The ringgit could be a beneficiary of Singapore’s
currency policy given the close trade ties,” said Lam Chee Mun,
a  fund manager  in  Kuala Lumpur  at TA Investment Management Bhd.
“There’s a possibility of policy makers front-loading rate
hikes to fight inflation and we could see incremental fund
inflows as a result of that.”  The currency reversed earlier losses today to approach the
strongest level since 1997 as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. predicted Singapore
will allow its currency to strengthen to damp inflation at its
April 14 monetary policy review. Crude oil climbed for a third
day to more than $111 a barrel in  New York , capping a 22 percent
rally this year. Singapore is Malaysia’s biggest export market.  The ringgit advanced 0.1 percent to 3.0215 per dollar as of
4:31 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur from a week ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It climbed 0.3 percent today, the most in
three weeks, after reaching a 13-year high of 3.0190 on April 1.  A decision by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to allow
its dollar to appreciate would have a “ripple effect” on
regional currencies, according to a research note from Goldman
Sachs yesterday. The MAS may prefer a “slight” increase in the
pace of currency gains, ANZ said in a report today. The ringgit
may receive a “short-term boost from heightened expectations of
more tightening” should MAS tighten next week, Morgan Stanley
said in an April 7 note.  Bond Auction  Bank Negara Malaysia  will hold its next interest-rate
meeting on May 5. Policy makers have kept the overnight policy
rate at 2.75 percent since July, after lifting it three times
earlier in 2010. The central bank raised banks’ reserve-
requirement ratio to 2 percent from 1 percent from April 1.  Malaysia’s three-year  government bonds  had a first winning
week in three before a government debt sale next week.  The yield on the 3.434 percent note due August 2014 dropped
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.36 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The price rose 0.37, or 3.7 ringgit
per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 100.24.  The government will auction 3 billion ringgit ($992
million) of April 2026 bonds on April 14, the central bank
announced on its website today. It last sold 15-year notes in
July 2004.  Overseas investors held 137.9 billion ringgit of local-
currency debt at the end of February, up 91 percent from a year
earlier,  Bank Negara  said on March 31. The holdings included a
record 79.4 billion ringgit of government bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
