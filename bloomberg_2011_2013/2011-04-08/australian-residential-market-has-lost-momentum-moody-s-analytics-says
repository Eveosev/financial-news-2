Australia ’s housing market is likely
to see only “modest” gains in prices as unusually wet weather
and floods in Queensland slowed demand and first-home buyers
remained on the sidelines, Moody’s Analytics said.  “Australia’s housing market has lost momentum, and
although demand should improve, house price gains will be
modest,” Matthew Circosta, an economist at Moody’s Analytics,
wrote. “Auction clearance rates, although improving, have
failed to breach an average 60 percent in recent weeks and sit
well below the 80 percent recorded in mid-2010.”  Home loan approvals for February declined for a second
month after floods and a cyclone in Queensland disrupted the
housing market on the nation’s east coast. First-time buyers
accounted for 14.9 percent of dwellings financed during the
month, the lowest level since 2004, as the effects of the
government’s first-home buyer incentives wore off and seven
interest rate increases since November 2009 took their toll.  “Potential first-time buyers are on the sidelines,
discouraged by high borrowing costs and affordability
problems,” Circosta said.  While future demand will be supported by wage growth and
falling unemployment, higher  interest rates  will keep
affordability constrained, according to Moody’s.  Australia’s jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent in March, the
statistics bureau said yesterday, matching a two-year low set in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
