Following is the text of
 Canada 's
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Overall employment was unchanged in March, as gains in
full-time work were offset by declines in part time. The
unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage points to
7.7%. Over the past 12 months, employment has risen by
1.8% (+305,000).  Full-time employment rose by 91,000 in March, and was
offset by a decline of 92,000 in part time. This large
full-time increase brought gains in full-time employment
to 251,000 (+1.8%) over the past 12 months, while part
time increased by 54,000 (+1.7%).  There were employment gains in accommodation and food
services as well as construction in March, and losses in
health care and social assistance and in public
administration.  The number of public sector employees fell in March.
Compared with 12 months earlier, public sector growth
(+2.4%) was slightly faster than that of private sector
employees (+2.1%), while self-employment was unchanged.  In March, employment declined in  Quebec  and increased
in Prince  Edward Island . There were no notable changes in
overall employment in the other provinces.  Employment increased for men aged 25 and over, while it
declined among youths aged 15 to 24 and women 55 and over.  Gains in accommodation and food services as well as
construction  The number of workers in accommodation and food
services increased by 36,000 in March. This gain brought
employment in this industry to roughly the same level as
12 months earlier.  Employment in construction rose by 24,000 in March,
continuing an upward trend that began in July 2009. Over
the past 12 months, employment in this industry has
increased by 5.3% (+64,000), one of the highest rates of
growth among all industries.  There were small losses in health care and social
assistance (-17,000) and in public administration 
(-13,000). Over the past 12 months, employment in these
industries increased by 2.9% and 2.1% respectively.  Little employment change across provinces  Employment in Quebec edged down 15,000 in March, and
the  unemployment rate  held steady at 7.7%. Over the past
12 months, employment growth in the province was 1.6%
(+62,000).  In March, employment in Prince Edward Island increased
by 1,400 and the unemployment rate was 11.2%. This
increase brought employment just above levels of one year
earlier.  In Ontario, total employment was little changed, as
full-time gains of 63,000 were offset by part-time losses
of 58,000. The unemployment rate was 8.1%. Over the past
12 months, employment grew by 2.1% in this province.  While there was little change in employment in British
Columbia, the unemployment rate fell from 8.8% to 8.1% as
fewer people looked for work.  Gains among adult men offset by losses among youths, women
55 and over  Employment for men aged 25 and over was up 32,000 in
March, with increases in full time. The gains were shared
between men 25 to 54 and 55 and over. Employment growth
over the past 12 months among core-age men was 2.1%, while
that of men 55 and over was 4.9%.  Employment in March was unchanged for core-age women
and fell by 17,000 for women aged 55 and over. Compared
with 12 months earlier, employment was unchanged for core-
age women, while it increased by 6.6% for women 55 and
over.  The number of employed 15- to 24- year-olds fell by
17,000 in March, with notable losses in part-time work.
The unemployment rate was little changed at 14.4%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, youth employment
increased by 0.5%.  Quarterly update for the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
data about the territories. These data are produced
monthly in the form of three-month moving averages. The
territorial estimates presented in this release are not
seasonally adjusted; therefore, comparisons are made on a
year-over-year basis.  All three territories saw employment gains in the first
quarter of 2011 compared with the same quarter of 2010.  In Yukon, employment increased by 2,500 in the three
months ending in March 2011 compared with the same period
in 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, the unemployment
rate was 5.1%.  Employment in the Northwest Territories rose by 1,700
from the first quarter of 2010 to the same period in 2011,
pushing the unemployment rate down to 6.3%.  In Nunavut, employment increased by 500 in the first
quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of 2010.
However, the number of people searching for work also
increased, bringing the unemployment rate up to 17.3%.  Note to readers  Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will
have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates, and how to use standard errors
to assess this variability, consult the "Data quality"
section of the publication Labour Force Information 
(71-001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
