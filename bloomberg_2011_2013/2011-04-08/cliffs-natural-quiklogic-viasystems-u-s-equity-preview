Shares of the following companies
are having unusual moves in U.S. trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 1:45 p.m. in  New York .  Car companies slumped after  China  said 2011 car sales may
grow slower than estimates.  Ford Motor Co. (F)   slumped 3
percent to $14.87.  General Motors Co. (GM)   declined 2.7
percent to $30.66.  American Medical Systems Holdings Inc. (AMMD)   surged 32
percent to $29.46 after climbing to $29.53, the highest intraday
price since it went public in August 2000. The supplier of
medical devices to physicians specializing in  urological
disorders agreed to be bought by  Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings
Inc. (ENDP)   for $30 a share, or $2.9 billion in cash. Endo
added 2.2 percent to $41.75.  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB)   gained 6.8 percent to $78.29 for
the biggest increase in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The
world’s largest maker of multiple sclerosis medicines said a
study showed its experimental MS pill reduced patients’ relapse
rate after two years.  Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH)   slumped 29 percent
to $28.28 after triggering stock-trading curbs a record five
times. The hospital operator was sued by  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) 
 for allegedly overbilling Medicare. Tenet said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it is claiming
Community Health’s ability to finance its hostile bid for Tenet
is impaired because its stock is worth less than stated. Tenet
fell the most in the  S&P 500 , sinking 12 percent to $6.67.  Tomi Galin, a spokeswoman for Franklin, Tennessee-based
Community Health, didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment.  Another hospital operator,  Health Management Associates
Inc. (HMA)  , slumped 6.8 percent to $9.94.  Electronics for Imaging Inc. (EFII)   climbed 17 percent
to $17.51 after jumping as much as 21 percent, the most intraday
since September 2005. The digital-printing company said it
earned at least 27 cents a share in the first quarter, including
a currency benefit of 3 cents a share. That beat the average
analyst estimate of 16 cents in a Bloomberg survey.  Global Crossing Ltd. (GLBC)   surged 57 percent to $23.26,
the biggest advance in the Russell 2000 Index.  Level 3
Communications Inc. (LVLT)   agreed to buy the
telecommunications provider in an all-stock transaction worth
$23.04 a share based on Level 3’s closing price April 8, with a
total deal value of about $1.9 billion. Level 3 soared 9.7
percent to $1.58 for the biggest gain in the Russell 1000 Index.  Howard Hughes Corp. (HHC)   tumbled 9.2 percent to $58.55
after sliding 12 percent4, the most intraday since the property
company was spun off from General Growth Properties Inc. in
November. Shareholders were “scared away” by the $503 million
in 2010 writedowns the company reported on April 8, according to
Wilkes Graham, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading
LLC. “The stock trades 200,000 shares per day, so it takes
time,” he said.  Madison Square Garden Inc. (MSG)   increased 5.1 percent
to $29.01 and jumped 8.7 percent earlier, the most intraday
since May 7. The owner of the  New York Knicks  may rise to the
mid-$40’s as the economy improves and its sports programs
attract more advertisers, Barron’s reported.  Molycorp Inc. (MCP)   jumped 5.9 percent to $71.16 after
climbing to $72.74, the highest intraday price since it went
public in July 2010. The owner of the world’s largest rare-earth
deposit outside China had its price estimate raised to $90 from
$74 at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which cited higher prices for the
metals.  Monsanto Co. (MON)   added 1 percent to $66.91 and
advanced 2.7 percent earlier, the most intraday since March 31.
The world’s largest seed company was raised to “buy” from
“hold” at Deutsche Bank AG. The 12-month share-price is $78.  QuickLogic Corp. (QUIK)   lost 17 percent to $4.04 after
slumping 22 percent, the most intraday since November 2009. The
provider of software solutions for mobile electronics slumped 17
percent to $4.06 and cut its first-quarter revenue forecast to
$5.5 million. That compares with the $6.8 million average
estimate of two analysts, Bloomberg data show.  Tasty Baking Co. (TSTY)   soared 147 percent to $3.97, the
most intraday since at least 1980. The maker of Tastykake snacks
is being acquired by  Flowers Foods Inc. (FLO)   for about $34
million or $4 a share. Flowers Foods, the U.S. baker whose
labels include Nature’s Own bread, advanced 2.8 percent to
$28.42.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)   gained 3.1 percent to $82.09 after
advancing 4.3 percent earlier, the most intraday since Jan. 18.
Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation on the offshore oil
driller to “overweight” from “equal-weight.”  Tyco International Ltd. (TYC)   jumped 3.8 percent to
$48.95 and climbed to $49.75 earlier, the highest intraday price
since July 2007. Schneider Electric SA (SU FP) is weighing a
takeover offer for Tyco that would make the French company the
world’s biggest maker of security systems, said three people
with knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
