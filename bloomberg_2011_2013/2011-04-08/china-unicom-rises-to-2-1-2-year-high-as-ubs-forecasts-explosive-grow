China  Unicom ( Hong Kong ) Ltd., the
nation’s second-largest mobile phone company, rose to the
highest level in more than 2 ½ years after UBS AG raised its
forecast for the shares because of “explosive” growth.  China Unicom gained 6.5 percent to HK$14.42 on the Hong
Kong stock exchange, the highest level since Aug. 14, 2008. The
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.5 percent.  UBS analyst Wang Jinjin today raised her 12-month price
estimate for China Unicom’s shares by 47 percent to HK$20 from
HK$13.60 due to growth in subscribers for the company’s third-
generation network service. Wang titled her report “Explosive
3G growth approaching.” Unicom is gaining share of high-end
data customers from market-leader  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , she wrote.  “We believe 3G and broadband will serve as two main growth
drivers to the whole industry, and Unicom will be the key
beneficiary,” Wang wrote in the report to clients today.
“China’s market presents a unique case that the dominant
operator China Mobile is being handicapped by an inferior
technology TD-SCDMA, which provides a golden opportunity for
China Unicom.”  Wang “substantially increased” her projection for
Unicom’s 3G subscribers for 2011, 2012 and 2013 to 28 million,
32 million, and 35 million, from her previous estimates of 18
million, 18 million and 25 million, she wrote. Wang kept her
rating on the stock at “buy.”  China Mobile dropped 0.2 percent to HK$73.70.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
