UniCredit SpA (UCG)  decided to abandon the
sale of its Pioneer Global Asset Management unit because the
three bids received were too low, Il Sole 24 Ore reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  In recent days, UniCredit told Amundi,  Resolution Ltd. (RSL)  and
 Natixis (KN)  SA that it won’t proceed with the sale, the newspaper
said.  Italy ’s finance ministry and the central bank weren’t in
favor of a sale to a foreign firm, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
