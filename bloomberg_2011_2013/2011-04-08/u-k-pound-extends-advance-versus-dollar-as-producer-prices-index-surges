     April 8 (Bloomberg) --The pound extended its advance
against the dollar after a report showed producer prices
increased more than economists forecast last month,
strengthening the case for higher  interest rates .  Sterling gained 0.6 percent to $1.6422 as of 9:38 a.m. in
 London , after climbing to $1.6428, the strongest level since
Jan. 19, 2010. It was little changed at 87.66 pence per euro,
erasing a decline of as much as 0.4 percent.  The cost of goods at factory gates increased 0.9 percent
from February, when they gained 0.5 percent, the Office for
National Statistics said today in London. The median forecast of
16 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 0.6
percent. The  Bank of England  kept its benchmark interest rate at
a record low of 0.5 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
