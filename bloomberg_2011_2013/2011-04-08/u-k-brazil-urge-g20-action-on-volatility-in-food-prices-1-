The U.K. and  Brazil  urged the G20
countries to take action to curb food-price volatility and end
export bans, according to a report from the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.  Brazil has 19 percent of the world’s arable land and 33
percent of global rainforests. Export bans don’t increase
sustainable production and “simply move price volatility
problems elsewhere in the world,” according to the report
released today. G20 agriculture ministers will meet in June in
an attempt to find solutions to rising food costs.  “Food price volatility hits the poorest the hardest,”
U.K. Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman, who is visiting
Brazil, said in the report. “Less volatile food commodity
prices will mean fewer price spikes, less food price inflation
and can help to avoid the sorts of riots we’ve seen over food
prices in many parts of the world.”  Costlier food contributed to riots across northern  Africa 
and the Middle East that toppled leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia 
earlier this year.  Food prices fell in March, the first monthly decline since
June after rising to a record in February as commodities
increased, the  United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organization
said in a report yesterday. Corn has more than doubled in the
past year and wheat is up 69 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
