ProSieben Sat.1 Media AG attracted
bids including from Finland’s  Sanoma Oyj (SAA1V)  for the advertising-
supported television stations in  Belgium  and the  Netherlands 
that the German company has put up for sale.  Sanoma submitted an offer together with a group of local
partners, the Finnish publisher said today. John de Mol, the
Dutch entrepreneur who helped create the “Big Brother”
television show, and former Belgian sports journalist  Wouter
Vandenhaute  are also bidding, said a person with knowledge of
the matter who asked not to be identified because the sale
process is confidential.  ProSiebenSat.1,  Germany ’s biggest private broadcaster, is
seeking more than 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) for those
operations as a deadline for binding bids expires today, said
the person. The Unterfoerhring-based company is also soliciting
bids of at least 1.2 billion euros by next week for channels in
 Scandinavia , according to the person.  “Sanoma was mentioned earlier as interested in SBS
Scandinavia but given its recent formation of a media division
with magazines, TV and online operations, we see the assets in
Sanoma’s existing strong operating countries -- the Netherlands
and Belgium -- to be of more interest,” Sami Sarkamies, a
Helsinki-based analyst for Nordea Bank, wrote in a report.  ‘No Certainty’  ProSiebenSat.1 declined to comment. De Mol is interested in
the German broadcaster’s SBS unit in the Netherlands, spokesman
Thomas Notermans said today. He declined to say whether a bid
has been submitted. A call to  Woestijnvis , Vandenhaute’s
production company in Vilvoorde, Belgium, after office hours
wasn’t picked up.  “There can be no certainty that Sanoma will be selected
for negotiations or that such negotiations would result in a
transaction,” Kim Ignatius, chief financial officer of the
Helsinki-based publisher, said in a statement.  ProSiebenSat.1 Chief Executive Officer Thomas Ebeling said
March 3 that the company will decide on a sale of the businesses
in the second quarter. The assets in the markets have a combined
value of 2 billion euros, according to the broadcaster’s 2009
annual report.  ProSiebenSat.1 rose 1.3 percent to 19.37 euros at the 5:30
p.m. close of trading in  Frankfurt . That pared the stock’s
decline this year to 14 percent, valuing the broadcaster at 4.2
billion euros.  Telegraaf, Modern Times  Telegraaf Media Groep NV (TELEG) , which owns 12 percent of
ProSiebenSat.1, is no longer in the race, De Volkskrant
newspaper reported today, citing people familiar with the
matter. Telegraaf remains interested in the Dutch assets, said
Hans Elekan, a spokesman for the Amsterdam-based publisher.  Modern Times Group AB (MTGB) ,  Sweden ’s largest private
broadcaster, made an offer for the Scandinavian division, people
familiar with the matter said last month.  ProSiebenSat.1 is controlled by private-equity firms
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Permira Advisers LLP. In 2007,
they combined ProSiebenSat.1 with SBS Broadcasting Group,
another company they control, to add TV stations and radio
networks in Scandinavia, Belgium, Netherlands and southeastern
 Europe .  ProSiebenSat.1 runs the Kanal 5 and Kanal 9 television
channels in Sweden, the TV Norge, FEM, The Voice TV and Max
brands in Norway, The Voice TV and TV Viisi channels in  Finland 
and Kanal 5, Kanal 4, The Voice TV and 6’eren channels in
Denmark. In the Netherlands, it operates SBS 6, Net5 and
Veronica and in Belgium, it owns VT4 and VIJFTV.  To contact the reporters on this story:
