Swaziland asked the International
Monetary Fund to implement a six month “staff-monitored
program” to improve its fiscal position and accelerate
structural reform in its economy.  The program will help the southern African country cope
with reduced revenue from a regional customs union and to reduce
its state wage bill, Swaziland said in a letter of intent
published on the Washington-based institution’s website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
