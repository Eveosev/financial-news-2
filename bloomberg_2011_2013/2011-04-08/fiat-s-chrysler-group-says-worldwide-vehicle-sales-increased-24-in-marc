Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker operated by  Fiat SpA (F) , said global auto sales in March
rose 24 percent from a year earlier while growth outside of
 North America  slowed from February.  Global deliveries climbed to 164,092 vehicles last month,
Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler said in an e-mail.
Worldwide sales this year through March rose 18 percent to
393,879, below the 32 percent growth rate that Chief Executive
Officer  Sergio Marchionne  has targeted for this year.  Marchionne is pushing Chrysler to sell 2 million vehicles
this year and turn its first annual net profit since emerging
from bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. Chrysler expects growth
outside of North America to accelerate as more of new or
redesigned models arrive in  Europe , Mike Manley, head of
international operations, said in an interview yesterday.  “I’m looking for the rate of growth to pick up,” he said.  Sales outside of North America rose 1.6 percent from a year
earlier to 13,996 in March, Ralph Kisiel, a Chrysler spokesman,
said in an e-mail. That’s slower than the 8.6 percent gain in
non-North American sales the company posted in February.  Kisiel declined to specify non-North American sales by
regions as Chrysler did for January and February results.  Chrysler’s best-selling vehicle outside North America in
March was the Jeep Wrangler with 2,256 deliveries, Ann Smith, a
Chrysler spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  First-quarter sales outside of  Canada ,  Mexico  and the U.S.
rose 3.5 percent from a year earlier to 36,911.  “I’ve been very pleased with the way international sales
have developed,” Manley said.  Sales in Canada rose 7.7 percent last month to 20,971 and
17 percent to 7,395 in Mexico, Kisiel said. The company
previously reported U.S. sales rose 31 percent to 121,703.  To contact the reporters on this story:
