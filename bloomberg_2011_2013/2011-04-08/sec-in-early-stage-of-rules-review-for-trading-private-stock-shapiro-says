The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is in the “very early stages” of reviewing rules on
trading of shares in closely held firms such as Facebook Inc.
and Twitter Inc., SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said today.  “What we have to balance at the end of this process is
capital formation and its importance to companies with investor
protection and the need for investors to have the information
that’s important for them to make informed business decisions,”
Schapiro told reporters at the Society of American Business
Editors and Writers conference in Dallas.  Regulators focused on markets for trading private shares
after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  announced and then dropped a plan
to offer as much as $1.5 billion in Facebook shares to U.S.
investors. Lawmakers and small businesses have questioned
whether current rules make it too difficult for companies to
raise money from investors.  Among the rules under consideration is one that would
require companies with 500 or more shareholders to file public
financial statements, Schapiro said in an April 6 letter to
Representative  Darrell Issa , a California Republican. Issa, who
leads the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked
Schapiro last month to clarify the SEC’s position on the rules,
saying some of them might be hindering firms’ ability to grow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
