Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  India ’s largest
wind-turbine maker, may be headed for a “turnaround” after its
German unit won its biggest European order to date, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients.  The company’s 95 percent-owned  Repower Systems AG (RPW)  unit,
yesterday announced it will supply 240 machines to Juwi Holding
AG, a “sign of recovery in its key market,” said Mumbai-based
analyst Bharat Parekh, who rates the stock a “buy.”  Suzlon’s profitability may recover from two years of losses
by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012, on higher rates for
wind power, a faster shift in production at Repower to lower-
cost plants in India, reduced liquidity concerns, Parekh said.  “We believe that Suzlon is bottoming out,” the note said,
which set a share price target of 70 rupees.  Suzlon rose 3.2 percent to close at 55.15 rupees in Mumbai
trading. The benchmark Sensitive Index fell 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
