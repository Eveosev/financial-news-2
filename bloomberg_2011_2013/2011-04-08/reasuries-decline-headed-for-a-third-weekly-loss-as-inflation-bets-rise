Treasuries fell, extending a third
weekly loss, as traders added to bets on inflation with the
dollar dropping to the lowest level since December 2009, oil
reaching $113 a barrel and gold climbing to a record.  A measure of inflation expectations used by the central
bank reached the highest level in a month. Federal funds futures
contracts showed the chance of an interest-rate rate increase
this year is 36 percent, and the likelihood of one in the first
quarter of 2012 is 70 percent. The European Central Bank
yesterday raised its key rate for the first time since July
2008. A U.S. government shutdown loomed.  “Internationally, we are starting to see inflation
concerns creep back into the market, and oil creeping higher
isn’t helping,” said Tom di Galoma, head of U.S. rates trading
at Guggenheim Capital Markets LLC, a  New-York  based brokerage
for institutional investors.  Ten-year yields rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3.58 percent at 5:16 p.m. in New York, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yields, which have gained 14
basis points since April 1, reached 3.61 percent, the highest
level since Feb. 18. The 3.625 percent note due in February 2021
fell 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 3/8.  The two-year note yield increased two basis points to 0.81
percent, while the 30-year bond yield rose three basis points to
4.64 percent after earlier touching 4.67 percent, the highest
since March 9. The 30-year yield has gained 16 basis points this
week, the most since the five days ended Feb. 4.  Dollar Slumps  The Dollar Index, which InterContinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback versus the currencies of six major
trading partners, sank to 74.8, the least since December 2009.
Gold gained as much as 1.2 percent to $1,475.60 an ounce, while
crude oil for May delivery reached $113.21 a barrel in New York,
the highest since September 2008.  Federal Reserve officials last month were divided over
whether to begin removing record stimulus this year as they
debated policy after the end of their $600 billion bond-purchase
program, minutes released this week of their March 15 meeting
showed. They’ve differed since then in public statements.  The Fed is “near a tipping point” and risks over-
stimulating the economy and generating inflation,  Dallas  Fed
President  Richard Fisher  said today in the text of a speech in
Dallas to the Society of American Business Editors and Writers.  ‘Fragile Quality’  Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  said today the Fed
should take its time in withdrawing economic stimulus amid
moderate growth and a quickening of inflation that will probably
prove temporary. The economy has “a halting and fragile
quality,” he said in a speech in Knoxville,  Tennessee .  The longest maturities, those most sensitive to inflation,
are suffering the steepest declines. They also slid as the U.S.
prepared to sell $32 billion of 3-year notes, $21 billion of 10-
year debt and $13 billion of 30-year bonds in three daily
auctions beginning April 12.  The  consumer price index  rose 2.1 percent in February from
a year earlier, while the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation,
 consumer spending  on goods excluding food and energy, increased
0.9 percent for the same period. The U.S. will report April 15
the CPI accelerated to an annualized 2.6 percent in March,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of traders’ expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, widened to as
much as 2.66 percentage points, the most since March 2008. The
measure, known as the 10-year break-even rate, was at 2.74
percent in 2006.  Bond-Market Gauge  A bond-market gauge of inflation expectations the Fed uses
to help determine monetary policy, the five-year forward
inflation rate, increased to 3.01 percentage points, the most
since March 8. The measure has averaged 2.8 percent over the
past five years.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 3.4 percent this year, while
securities due in 12 months and less are little changed,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index gained 5.6 percent in the period.  Six- and three-month yields have fallen this week as the
Treasury cut to $5 billion from $200 billion the amount of
outstanding Supplementary Financing Program bills it sells on
behalf of the Fed in a program set up in 2008 to support the
financial system. The reduction was made as the U.S. approaches
its federal debt limit.  Six-month bill rates dropped to a record-low 0.1048 percent
before trading at 0.1068 percent. Three-month rates slid to
0.0203 percent, the lowest level since December 2009.  Obama Wants Deal  President  Barack Obama  called on lawmakers to reach a last-
minute deal to avert a government shutdown. Democratic leaders
said they agreed to cut $38 billion in spending and that
Republicans are refusing to accept federal funding for Planned
Parenthood. Republicans said the dividing issue was spending.  U.S. government debt  gained 0.8 percent during the 21-day
government closure that at the end of 1995 and the start of
1996, the Bank of America figures show.  Treasury yields are below levels seen in the past decade
even as government borrowing increases. Ten-year rates climbed
as high as 5.53 percent in 2001 as traders speculated on when
the Fed would finish cutting borrowing costs.  Billionaire investor  George Soros  said the  European Central
Bank ’s decision yesterday to raise its benchmark lending rate
was “quite inappropriate” because several euro member
countries are suffering from too much debt. Soros spoke in an
interview with Bloomberg Television at a conference in  Bretton
Woods ,  New Hampshire .  The ECB raised its rate to 1.25 percent a day after
 Portugal  became the third debt-strapped country to request aid
from the European Union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
