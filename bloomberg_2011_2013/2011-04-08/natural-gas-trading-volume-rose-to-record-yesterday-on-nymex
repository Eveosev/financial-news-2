Natural gas futures trading volume
rose to a record yesterday on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
after an Energy Department report showed a smaller-than-expected
decline in U.S. stockpiles.  Volume reached 546,752 contracts, breaking the previous
record of 526,280 set on Feb. 10, according to Chris Grams, a
spokesman for CME Group Inc., which owns the Nymex.  Natural gas for May delivery fell 8.9 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $4.057 per million British thermal units yesterday
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices dropped an
additional 1.6 cents today to $4.041, a three-week low.  The Energy Department said stockpiles declined 45 billion
cubic feet in the week ended April 1 to 1.579 trillion cubic
feet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
