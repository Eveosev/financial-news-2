Botswana Development Corp., the
country’s investment arm, plans to list shares of its property
unit on June 15, the company announced in the capital, Gaborone,
today.   Letlole La Rona Ltd. was formed last year to hold the
company’s property assets, it said in its prospectus.  Letlole plans to list a total of 280 million units at a
price of 1.50 Botswanan pula ($0.23) each on the main board of
the Botswana Stock Exchange with a stated share capital of 420
million pula.  “A total of 84 million linked units has been retained by
Botswana Development by way of private placement and BDC has
undertaken to take up the unsubscribed units,” Letlole Chief
Executive Officer Kelly Clinton said.  Clinton expects all shares to be subscribed for by the May
26 closing date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
