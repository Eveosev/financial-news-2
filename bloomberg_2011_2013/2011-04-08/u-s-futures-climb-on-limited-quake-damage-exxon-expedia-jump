U.S. stocks fell for a second day as
crude oil rallied above $112 a barrel for the first time in 30
months, lifting energy shares while dragging down transportation
and consumer companies.  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  lost 6.6 percent as the
NYSE Arca Airlines Index slid to an almost seven-month low,
while  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and Macy’s Inc. fell at least 1.9 percent.
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  paced gains in 30
of 41 energy companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
 Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF)  and  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX)  led raw-material producers higher as metals advanced.  The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,331.35 after gaining as
much as 0.5 percent earlier today. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  decreased 20.32 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,389.17.
The  U.S. dollar  fell 0.9 percent to $1.4435 per euro, helping
drive up prices of commodities traded in dollars.  “As oil rises, the synchronized trade is to de-risk,”
said Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New Jersey-based money
manager at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees $110 billion in
client assets. “Higher commodities prices raise concern about
future inflation and consumption. One should keep a careful eye
on companies’ forecasts and on input costs in particular.”  The  S&P 500  rose 6 percent in 2011 through yesterday as
government stimulus measures and higher-than-estimated profits
boosted investors’ optimism. U.S. stocks fell yesterday,
dragging the Dow average down from an almost three-year high, as
another earthquake shook Japan and a dispute over the federal
budget threatened to shut down the American government.  Budget Cuts  Democrats have agreed to $38 billion in U.S. budget cuts,
and funding for Planned Parenthood remains the only policy
sticking point in talks aimed at avoiding a government shutdown
tonight, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters.  “We have worked out every other rider” on policy issues
aside from Republicans’ insistence on halting money for Planned
Parenthood, said Reid, a Nevada Democrat. “If they back off
from this ideological issue that is holding up this country, we
have a number agreed upon.”  Commodities rose for a seventh day on optimism about
economic recovery and on a weaker dollar. Gold and tin climbed
to records. The S&P GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw-materials
futures reached the highest level since October 2008.  Oil rose above $112 a barrel in New York for the first time
since 2008 and surpassed $125 a barrel in London as a fire
burned at Libya’s Sarir field, bolstering concern that unrest in
the region will further reduce supply.  Haven Assets  The dollar dropped against most of its major counterparts
on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will trail other central
banks in raising  interest rates  and as signs of global growth
damped demand for haven assets.  “We’re not in a bubble condition,” said  Philip Orlando ,
the New York-based chief equity market strategist at  Federated
Investors Inc. (FII) , which manages $358.2 billion. “You’ve got
multiple drivers that are resulting in this commodities rally.
There’s a weaker dollar versus the euro in response to European
monetary policy. There’s also inflation concern. The third and
most important one is the improvement of global economic growth,
which is resulting in more demand. That’s positive for stocks.”  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher
said the central bank faces a “significant” risk of providing
record stimulus for too long and should weigh curtailing its
$600 billion bond-purchase plan.  ‘Tipping Point’  “We at the Fed are near a tipping point,” the 62-year-old
regional bank chief said in the text of a speech today in
Dallas. “Just as we pressed on in doing our duty through
extraordinary, exigent measures, we must now discipline
ourselves to just as persistently normalize our operations in a
timely way.”  The NYSE Arca Airline Index slumped 2.5 percent as 14 of
its 15 stocks retreated. United Continental Holdings fell 6.6
percent to $19.62.  AMR Corp. (AMR)  declined 3.8 percent to $5.81.  FedEx lost 1.9 percent to $92.11 and Macy’s slipped 2.3
percent to $24.82.  Energy shares had the biggest gain within 10 S&P 500
industries, rallying 0.6 percent.  Chevron gained 0.8 percent to $109.86. Occidental Petroleum
added 2.3 percent to $103.41.  Cliffs Natural Resources gained 1.1 percent to $99.46.
Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly traded copper
producer, rose 1.3 percent to $58.18.  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  surged 12 percent to $25.09. The company will
split into two separate businesses, giving investors a chance to
own shares in its fast-growing TripAdvisor unit.  TripAdvisor ,
which includes 19 travel and advertising brands, will be spun
off into a publicly traded company. Expedia investors will
receive a proportionate amount of shares in TripAdvisor, the
company said.  Seagate Technologies Plc advanced 8.2 percent to $15.89.
The world’s largest maker of computer disk drives said it would
pay a quarterly dividend of 18 cents and reported third-quarter
sales that topped analysts’ predictions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
