European Central Bank Executive
Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said  Spain  will be
protected from the sovereign debt crisis if it sticks to its
reform plans.  If Spain “abides by the commitments” made to change the
labor market and banking sector and as long as it reins in
spending at the regional level the nation is “absolutely ring-
fenced, is protecting itself,” Gonzalez-Paramo told reporters
in Berlin today. “But there are very important conditions to
secure a comfortable situation and not running any risk. It
fully depends now on the resolve of the Spanish government.”  Spain, in an attempt to distance itself from other so-
called peripheral nations, is implementing the deepest budget
cuts in at least three decades while trying to shore up savings
banks.  Portugal  this week became the euro area’s third member
after Greece and Ireland to succumb to the euro region’s
sovereign-debt crisis and seek a European Union bailout.  “So far there has been no impact from the news that
Portugal has requested aid,” Gonzalez-Paramo said. “But
everybody acknowledges that the situation remains fragile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
