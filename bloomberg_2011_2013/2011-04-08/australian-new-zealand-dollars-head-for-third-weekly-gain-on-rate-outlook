Australia ’s dollar rose to a record
versus the greenback, and  New Zealand ’s currency reached a four-
month high, as traders added to bets central banks in the two
nations will increase  interest rates  over the next 12 months.  The  New Zealand dollar , called the kiwi, gained for a third
week versus its U.S. counterpart, the longest rally since
October. The Aussie also had a third weekly advance, its longest
winning streak in two months. Both South Pacific currencies
advanced versus the yen as investors borrowed in  Japan , where
yields are low, to fund purchase in higher-returning countries
such as Australia and New Zealand in the so-called carry trade.  “Any dips in Aussie and kiwi are going to be quite
shallow, because these remain the most attractive currencies to
put on carry trades,” said  Todd Elmer , Singapore-based head of
Group-of-10 currency strategy for Asia ex-Japan at Citigroup
Inc. “We’re likely to see significant appreciation in these
currencies, which for Aussie should take us up toward $1.10.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.6 percent to $1.0535 at 12:55
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0469 yesterday. It touched $1.0545,
the strongest level since being allowed to trade freely in 1983,
and appreciated 1.4 percent for the week. The Aussie gained 0.8
percent today and 2.6 percent this week to 89.56 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar advanced 0.4 percent to 78.20 U.S.
cents, from 77.88 cents yesterday, and touched 78.35 cents, the
highest since Nov. 22. It strengthened 1.9 percent for the week.
The kiwi appreciated 0.5 percent today and climbed 3 percent
this week to 66.47 yen.  Rate Bets  Traders bet that the amount of interest-rate increases by
the  Reserve Bank  of Australia over the next 12 months will be 31
basis points, or 0.31 percentage point, up from 18 basis points
at the end of last week, according to a Credit Suisse AG index.
A similar gauge shows forecasts for increases in New Zealand’s
key rate rose to 46 basis points, from 42 basis points.  Benchmark rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and 2.5
percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the U.S.
and Japan.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares gained 0.9 percent
for the day and the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
