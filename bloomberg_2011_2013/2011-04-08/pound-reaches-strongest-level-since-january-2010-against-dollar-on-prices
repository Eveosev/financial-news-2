The pound rose to its strongest
level since January 2010 against the dollar as British data
showed producer prices rose at a faster pace than economists
predicted, strengthening the case for higher interest rates.  Short-sterling futures dropped, while U.K. government bonds
declined as gains in stocks curbed demand for the relative
safety of fixed income. The cost of goods at factory gates
increased 0.9 percent in March from February, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today, above the 0.6 percent median
forecast of 16 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The pound fell
versus the euro after German exports rose to a five-month high.  “The market is aggressively pricing in rate hikes,” said
 Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “Stock markets are moving
higher, and the pound tends to be a beneficiary of that.”  The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.6337 at 4:58 p.m. in
London, after climbing 0.6 percent to $1.6428, the strongest
level since Jan. 19, 2010. It has gained 1.4 percent this week.
Britain’s currency was 0.8 percent weaker at 88.36 pence per
euro, little changed for the week.  Britain’s benchmark stock index, the FTSE 100, rose 0.8
percent while the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.3 percent,
posting its third week of increases.  The Monetary Policy Committee kept the benchmark interest
rate at 0.5 percent yesterday, as predicted by all 57 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, while the  European Central Bank 
increased its main refinancing rate to 1.25 percent.  Forward Rates  Investors have priced in a 50 basis-point rise in the key
U.K. rate by November, according to forward rates on the
sterling overnight interbank average, or Sonia, compiled by
Tullett Prebon Plc. The implied yield on the December short-
sterling futures contract rose one basis point to 1.44 percent.
It has increased from 1.40 percent two weeks ago.  Losses by gilts pushed the 10-year yield six basis points
higher to 3.81 percent, the most since Feb. 21. The two-year
yield was at 1.42 percent, from 1.38 percent on April 1.  Gains by the pound will likely be limited as the central
bank judges the recovery is too fragile to withstand higher
borrowing costs, according to  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at
Danske Bank A/S in London.  “The  Bank of England  has been priced too aggressively,”
he said, forecasting that sterling will depreciate to 89 pence
per euro in two months. “I don’t see a strong case for them to
raise rates. They can sustain the pressure.”  Sterling has gained 0.9 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that measure the 10 most
widely traded currencies. It has trailed behind the euro’s 4
percent rise amid speculation signs that the economic recovery
is stalling will prompt the U.K.’s central bank to delay raising
interest rates even as inflation runs at twice its target.  Europe’s common currency climbed against 13 of its 16 most-
actively traded peers as a report showed surging German exports.  U.K. mortgage approvals declined 12 percent in February
from a year earlier, the  Council of Mortgage Lenders  said today.
Manufacturing growth unexpectedly stalled in February, a report
from the Office for National Statistics showed on April 6.
Overall industrial production slumped by 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
