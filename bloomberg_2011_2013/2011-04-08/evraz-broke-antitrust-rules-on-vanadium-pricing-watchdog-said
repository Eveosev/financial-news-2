Evraz Group SA (EVR) ’s vanadium unit, OAO
Kachkanarsky GOK, violated antitrust rules by charging Russian
customers different prices for vanadium concentrate and for
setting a “monopolistically high” price for ore, the Federal
Anti-Monopoly Service said in a  statement  on its website.  Evraz’s spokesman Oleg Kuzmin declined to comment until
the company receives an official letter from Russian watchdog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
