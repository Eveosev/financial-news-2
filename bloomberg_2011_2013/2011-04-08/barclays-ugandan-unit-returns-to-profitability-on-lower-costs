previous year, the Kampala-based bank said in an advertisement
published in the New Vision newspaper.  Operating expenses declined 17 percent to 97.81 billion
shillings from 117.76 billion shillings a year earlier after
consolidating investments from 2007, the statement said.
Customer deposits climbed 19.2 percent to 866.74 billion
shillings, the bank said. Net interest income rose 13.4 percent
to 78.70 billion shillings last year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
