China  has suspended imports of Jeep
Wrangler vehicles because of a potential safety hazard, Xinhua
News Agency said, citing a General Administration of Quality
Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine statement.  Consumers have reported several incidents of imported Jeep
Wranglers catching fire, with investigators tracing the problem
to the vehicles’ automatic transmissions and related systems,
China’s official news agency reported.  Chrysler Group LLC, Jeep’s owner, is working with the
Chinese regulator to identify and fix 2008-2010 Wranglers sold
in China that were equipped with automatic transmissions,
according to a statement posted on the company’s website.  The company said it’s not aware of injuries or accidents
caused by the problem, nor of any vehicle fires outside of China
after a global recall in February 2010. Before repairs,
transmission fluid could potentially overheat and be expelled on
to hot surfaces, creating a fire hazard, Chrysler said.  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based Chrysler is 25 percent owned
by  Fiat SpA. (F)   To contact the reporter on this story:
