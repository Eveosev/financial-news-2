Yuan forwards had the biggest weekly
gain this year before data due next week that economists
estimate will show inflation accelerated to a 32-month high.  The currency touched its strongest in 17 years today after
State Information Center Chief Economist  Zhu Baoliang  said the
People’s Bank of  China  should let the yuan appreciate to curb
price gains and improve its balance of international payments,
in a commentary published yesterday in Shanghai Securities News.  “There’s a lot of policy makers urging PBOC to use
renminbi strength to help curb imported inflation,” said Ho Woei Chen, an economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in
 Singapore . “There could be another trade deficit for China.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.7 percent
this week to 6.3753 per dollar in  Hong Kong . The contracts
reflected bets the yuan will gain 2.5 percent in a year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan rose 0.19 percent this week, the biggest weekly
advance since the period ended Feb. 14, to close at 6.5354 per
dollar in  Shanghai  as of 4:30 p.m., according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.5350 today,
the strongest level since the country unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. Financial markets were
closed on the first two days of the week for public holidays.  An average gain of 6 percent to 7 percent a year against
the  U.S. dollar  would be “reasonable,” Zhu wrote in the
newspaper. A government report on April 10 will show the trade
deficit reached $3.35 billion last month, compared with a
shortfall of $7.3 billion in February, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Inflation accelerated to 5.2 percent in March from a year
earlier, compared with 4.9 percent in February, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due April 15.  The central bank set the  reference rate  0.06 percent higher
at 6.5420 per dollar today, the strongest level since July 2005.
The currency is allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on either
side of the official rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
