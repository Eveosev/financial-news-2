Peru’s ruling Apra party is backing
presidential candidate Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former finance
minister, in this weekend’s first-round vote, the party’s
secretary-general, Jorge Del Castillo, said today.  Apra supporters may “easily” represent 10 percent of the
electorate, Del Castillo said in an interview with Lima-based
Canal N.  President  Alan Garcia , whose five-year mandate expires July
28, isn’t eligible to serve a second term. Former Finance
Minister Mercedes Araoz quit as Apra’s candidate in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
