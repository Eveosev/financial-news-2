Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
pushed back its forecast for the first interest-rate increase by
the  Bank of England  to August from May, citing a “lacklustre
rebound” in construction activity in February.  RBS economist  Ross Walker  cut his forecast for first-
quarter economic growth to 0.4 percent from 0.8 percent,
according to a note to clients today.  The  Office for National Statistics  said today that
construction output rose 8.6 percent in February from the
previous month, when it dropped 6.8 percent. Output was little
changed on the year. The data suggests the building industry
posted a seasonally-adjusted decline of about 5 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier, which lowers RBS’s gross-
domestic-product estimate for the period, Walker said.  “The underlying data appear significantly weaker than
previously assumed,” he said. “It is extremely difficult” to
see what could increase the economic growth estimate back to the
0.8 percent rate “we believe is required for the Monetary
Policy Committee to vote for a rate hike in May,” Walker said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
