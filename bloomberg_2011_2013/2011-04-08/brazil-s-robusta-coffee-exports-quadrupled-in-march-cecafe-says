Robusta coffee exports from  Brazil ,
the world’s second-largest producer of the variety after
Vietnam, quadrupled in March to 183,421 bags, figures from the
country’s Coffee Exporters Council, known as Cecafe, showed.  Shipments of arabica beans fell 6.9 percent to about 2.2
million bags, according to a Cecafe report yesterday.
Brazil is the world’s largest producer of coffee and the biggest
producer of arabicas.  Arabica beans are grown mainly in Latin America and favored
for specialty beverages such as those made by Starbucks Corp.
Robusta, used in instant coffee and espresso, is harvested
mostly in  Asia  and parts of Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
