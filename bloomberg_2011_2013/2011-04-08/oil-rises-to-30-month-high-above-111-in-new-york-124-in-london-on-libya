Oil rose above $111 a barrel in New
York and surpassed $124 a barrel in  London  for the first time
since 2008 as a fire burned at Libya’s Sarir field, bolstering
concern that unrest in the region will further reduce supply.  Futures are headed for a third weekly gain as NATO said
forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  caused a fire at Sarir, Al
Arabiya television reported yesterday. The Libyan conflict is in
a stalemate, according to Army General Carter Ham, the U.S.
commander for Africa. Output from Africa’s third-largest
producer may remain limited to about 29 percent of pre-conflict
levels even after fighting ends, Nomura Holdings Inc. said.  “It’s pretty clear that this is going to be a long-running
game,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in
London. “Supplies from  Libya  are unlikely to emerge at any
point soon.”  Crude for May delivery rose as much as $1.60, or 1.5
percent, to $111.90 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the highest since Sept. 22, 2008. The
contract was at $111.69 at 1:12 p.m. London time. Prices are up
3.5 percent this week and 30 percent in the past year.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization stepped up its air
campaign over Libya, deploying 164 missions on April 6,
including 73 “strike sorties” to engage possible ground
targets, the military alliance said in a web statement.  Brent oil for May settlement climbed as much as $2.17, or
1.8 percent, to $124.70 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange, the highest since Aug. 4, 2008.  Uprisings  Brent was $12.87 a barrel more expensive than the benchmark
used in  New York , West Texas Intermediate. London-traded Brent,
traditionally cheaper than WTI, has traded above the New York
marker since August because of excess inventories in the U.S.  Brent, against which North African crude supplies are
priced, has surged 25 percent since the Jan. 14 ouster of
Tunisian President Zine Abidine Ben Ali. The Libyan conflict is
the bloodiest in a wave of uprisings that has spread to Algeria,
Bahrain,  Egypt , Iran, Jordan, Oman, Syria and Yemen.  “Key oil support came from Middle East headlines,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in  Melbourne , said in an e-mailed note. “The
Sirte Basin is where two-thirds of Libyan oil production comes
from. The oilfield was originally thought to be unlikely at risk
of sabotage due to its remote location in the Saharan desert, so
the fire significantly weighed on the supply outlook.”  OPEC Shipments  Libya’s crude output has fallen to between 250,000 barrels
and 300,000 barrels a day, all of which goes to domestic
refineries,  Shokri Ghanem , chairman of state-owned National Oil
Corp., said yesterday in a telephone interview from Tripoli. The
country supplied 1.39 million barrels a day in February,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of producers and analysts.  Libya is one of 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, a group that pumps 40 percent of the
world’s crude.  OPEC will cut oil loadings for a ninth week as Libya’s
exports decline, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements. The
group will ship 22.98 million barrels a day in the four weeks to
April 23, down from 23.36 million barrels a day in the period
ended March 26, the Halifax, England-based consultant said in a
report yesterday.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s biggest oil producer and most populous
nation, scheduled parliamentary elections for April 9 and a
presidential vote for April 16. Elections in 2003 and 2007 were
marred by violence, voter intimidation and the stuffing of
ballot boxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
