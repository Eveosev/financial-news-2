European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said that it’s important that the  U.S.
dollar  is a “strong currency.”  “I’ve always appreciated enormously the declaration of U.S.
authorities that a strong dollar is in the interest of the
U.S.,” Trichet said at a press conference near Budapest today.  “I only can refer to what I have said already, namely that I
see that the U.S. dollar is in a situation which is peculiar
taking into account the discussions that are taking place” on
the U.S. budget, Trichet said. “I mention that it is important
that the U.S dollar is a strong currency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
