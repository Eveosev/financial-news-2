the shares are “overbought,” said Wei-Hang Chen, an analyst at
President Capital Management Corp.  The shares had gained 33 percent this year as of
yesterday’s close, driving the relative strength index, a
measure of how rapidly prices have advanced or declined during a
specified time period, to 70.6. Some analysts see a reading of
more than 70 as a signal to sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
