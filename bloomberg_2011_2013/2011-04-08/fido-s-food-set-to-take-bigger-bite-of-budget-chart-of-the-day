U.S. pet owners beware: the cost of
feeding your animal is set to surge in coming months, following
the rise in your own food bill.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how changes in the food
component of the  consumer price index  have led movements in pet
food costs since 2006. In 2008, pet food prices jumped by 16
percent after human food inflation reached 6 percent. Human food
costs have accelerated to more than 2 percent as of February
after falling 0.7 percent at the end of 2009.  Americans spent more than $45 billion on pets and pet-
related products last year, exceeding the value of domestic car
purchases, according to data from the Commerce Department’s
 Bureau of Economic Analysis .  “Recent food price increases appear to be passing through
to pet food products, as they did to an even greater degree in
2008,  Zach Pandl , senior economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
said in a research note to clients. “These gains have added to
the rise in  core inflation , and likely will continue to do so
for a while longer.”  The CPI increased 2.1 percent in February from a year
earlier after rising by 1.6 percent in the 12 months ended in
January. The Labor Department is scheduled to release March
inflation figures on April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
