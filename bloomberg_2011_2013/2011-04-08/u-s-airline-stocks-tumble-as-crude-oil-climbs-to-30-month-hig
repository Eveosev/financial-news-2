United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. (AMR)  and other U.S. carriers
tumbled in U.S. trading as crude oil climbed above $112 for the
first time since September 2008.  United fell $1.21, or 5.8 percent, to $19.79 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and AMR slid 27
cents, or 4.5 percent, to $5.77. United led declines in the
Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index of 12 carriers, which retreated
3.4 percent for a seventh straight day of declines.  “The bad news is that we’re now faced with another fuel
crisis,” Gerard Arpey, chief executive officer of AMR, said
today in  Dallas . “To the extent that oil dampens economic
growth, we are all very worried about what is happening in oil
markets.”  Crude oil futures rose 2.3 percent to settle at $112.79, a
30-month high, amid skepticism that Libyan oil output would
rebound when fighting ends. Crude futures are 32 percent higher
than a year ago.  United, the world’s largest airline, burns $25,000 in fuel
every minute across its fleet of 1,200 aircraft, Chief Executive
Officer Jeff Smisek said at a Houston energy conference last
month. The Chicago-based carrier plans to ground some of its
older Boeing Co. 737-500 and 767-200ER jets to reduce fuel use,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
