Turkeyâ€™s budget deficit narrowed in
March from a year earlier, according to preliminary data from
the Treasury.  The budget deficit was 2.1 billion liras ($1.4 billion)
compared to a deficit of 4.3 billion liras in the same month of
2010, the Treasury in Ankara said on its website today.
Excluding interest payments on debt, the budget produced a
surplus of 1.4 billion liras, compared to a surplus of 690
million liras a year earlier.  The Treasury figures are preliminary data that measure cash
inflows and outflows. The  Finance Ministry  will release full
budget numbers later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
