Nigeria ’s central bank Governor
Lamido Sanusi said commercial banks should increase lending to
agriculture to at least 5 percent of total loans this year to
boost farming output.  Lending to agriculture currently makes up 1 percent of
credit by banks, Sanusi told a meeting of the Bankers’ Committee
today in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital.  Farming contributes the biggest share of Nigeria’s economic
output and employs more than half of the 150 million population,
most as small-scale farmers, according to the statistics office.
Nigeria’s government, which relies on oil exports for more than
80 percent of its revenue, is trying to reduce that dependence
to help sustain economic growth in  Africa ’s most populous
nation.  “That agriculture contributes 40 percent of GDP and is the
largest employer of labor and yet receives 1 percent of lending
is not good enough,” Sanusi said.  Nigeria’s 24 lenders agreed to triple lending to
agriculture to 3 percent of total loans, Phillips Oduoza, chief
executive officer of  United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , said on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
