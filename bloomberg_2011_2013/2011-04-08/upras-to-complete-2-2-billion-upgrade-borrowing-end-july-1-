Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri
AS (TUPRS) , Turkey’s sole oil refiner, expects to complete $2.2 billion
in borrowing by the end of July to fund an upgrade that will
reduce the sulphur content of its production in response to new
environmental standards.  Tupras is working with Spanish Eximbank to secure the
borrowing, Chief Executive Officer Yavuz Erkut said in comments
embargoed for today. The Izmit, Turkey-based company will also
decide by the end of July who will build the six or seven units
required for the residuum upgrade.  Spain ’s  Tecnicas Reunidas SA (TRE) 
has been hired by Tupras to lead the project and local builders
may also be involved, he said.  Tupras expects dollar sales to rise 50 percent this year
from 2010’s $17.5 billion, so long as oil remains in the region
of $120 a barrel, Erkut said. Those levels would also allow
“better profitability,” he said.  Net profit at the refiner fell 9 percent last year to 737.3
million liras ($465 million), partly because the company set
aside provisions for back taxes and fines. Tupras is owned by
 Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , the country’s largest industrial group.  Tupras rose 70 kurus, or 1.5 percent, to 47.10 liras at
12:24 p.m. on the  Istanbul Stock Exchange .  “Tupras is either first or second among its 25 peers in
Europe and Mediterranean in terms of refinery margins,” Erkut
said. “Although Mediterranean margins are in the negative now
after the Libyan crisis, ours are positive.”  Tupras gets 45 percent of its crude from Iran and  Saudi
Arabia , Erkut said.  The company’s market share in Turkey will rise to more than
50 percent this year, he said.  Capacity utilization in Tupras refineries was 75 percent in
2010, growing almost 10 percentage points from 2009, he said.
Tupras expects the same pace of growth this year, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
