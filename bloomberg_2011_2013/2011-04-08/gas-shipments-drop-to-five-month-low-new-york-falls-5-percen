Natural gas shipments scheduled for
delivery to U.S. households dropped to the lowest level in more
than five months as warmer weather reduced heating demand.
Deliveries for  New York  declined 5 percent.  Scheduled shipments for residential use fell for a third
day, down 5.8 percent to 26.9 million dekatherms (26.2 billion
cubic feet), the lowest level since Oct. 26, based on a sampling
of gas pipeline nominations compiled by Bloomberg as of 2:38
p.m. in New York.  About 2.39 million dekatherms were to be delivered to New
York homes, down from yesterday’s 2.52 million, Bloomberg data
show.  Prices at the Transco-Z6 hub, which delivers gas to the New
York City region, dropped 4.5 percent to $4.3439 per million
British thermal units on the Intercontinental Exchange, the
lowest level since March 17.  Gas at the Tetco-M3 hub, which also transports gas to the
New York area, declined 4 percent to $4.2866.  Temperatures will be at least 8 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal in the U.S. East, Midwest and South through April 12,
according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The low temperature in New York tomorrow will be 46 degrees
Fahrenheit (8 Celsius), 4 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. New York may
have a high of 81 degrees on April 11, AccuWeather said.  Natural gas accounts for 52 percent of New York’s heating
demand, according to  the Energy Department .  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, fell 1.6 percent
to $4.0529. The hub is the benchmark for gas futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
