U.S. nuclear-power output was little
changed as  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  slowed a reactor in Pennsylvania
and  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  boosted production by a North Carolina
plant, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  said.  Power generation nationwide increased 54 megawatts from
yesterday to 76,291 megawatts, or 75 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-four of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  FirstEnergy decreased power at the 940-megawatt Beaver
Valley 1 reactor to 82 percent of capacity from 100 percent
yesterday. Another 940-megawatt unit at the site, Beaver Valley
2, is shut. The plant is in Shippingport, about 26 miles (42
kilometers) northwest of Pittsburgh.  Duke increased capacity at the 1,100-megawatt McGuire 2
reactor to 97 percent from 77 percent yesterday. The 1,100-
megawatt McGuire 1 is operating at full power at the site 15
miles north of  Charlotte .  Energy Northwest, a regional power supplier, declared an
“unusual event” at the 1,190-megawatt Columbia reactor in
 Washington  at about 4 p.m. local time yesterday when “a small
hydrogen burn” occurred during maintenance, the NRC said.  “Columbia has confirmed there is no hazard to personnel
safety nor a challenge to safe plant operation,” the NRC said.  An “unusual event” is the lowest of four categories in
the federal agency’s emergency classification system.  The plant, 55 miles northwest of Walla Walla, was closed
because of a flood warning along the Columbia River on April 4
and remained shut for refueling and maintenance that was
scheduled to begin April 6.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
