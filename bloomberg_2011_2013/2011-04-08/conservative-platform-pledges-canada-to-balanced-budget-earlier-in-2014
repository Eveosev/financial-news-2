Canada ’s Prime Minister Stephen Harper released his Conservative Party’s election platform,
pledging C$6.6 billion ($6.9 billion) in new measures and
accelerating Canada’s return to surplus.  The platform  document , which was released today near
Toronto, pledges a “strategic and operating” review of
 government spending  with a goal of saving at least C$4 billion a
year by 2014 that will be used to finance new tax cuts and
spending, and allow the country to return to surplus one year
earlier than projected last month.  “We know there is fat to be saved,” Harper told reporters
in Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto.  The platform builds on Harper’s March 22 budget, which
wasn’t passed by Parliament before the governing Conservatives
were brought down by opposition parties, triggering the May 2
election. The new measures, which were not included in last
month’s fiscal plan, will boost the deficit in the next two
years by C$1.4 billion more than earlier projected before
savings allow the government to speed  deficit reduction .  Harper is seeking to cast himself as the best manager of
the economy, and criticized rival Liberal Leader  Michael Ignatieff  for pledging new spending measures that Harper says
can only be financed by raising taxes. Ignatieff released his
platform on April 4, pledging C$8.2 billion over two years to be
paid for by reversing tax cuts for companies like  Royal Bank of
Canada (RY)  and  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  implemented by Harper.  Jobs Decline  Statistics Canada  said today that employment fell by 1,500
in March, the first decline in six months, as a record drop in
part-time work outstripped the biggest gain in full-time
positions in a year. The  unemployment rate  declined to 7.7
percent from 7.8 percent as the  labor force  shrank.  Canada’s dollar remained higher after the job report as
investors focused on the 90,600 gain in full-time work, the
biggest since September 2009. The currency traded at 95.67 cents
per  U.S. dollar  at 12:57 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.82 cents
yesterday. Earlier it was 95.27 cents, the strongest since 2007.  Polls suggest the Conservatives would win the most seats in
the election, although it isn’t clear if they would win a
majority.  The Conservatives were supported by 40.6 percent of decided
voters, followed by 31.1 percent who supported the Liberals,
according to a CTV/Globe/Nanos election survey published today
and taken April 5-April 7. The telephone survey of 1,200 people
has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percent.  Campaign Pledges  Today’s announcement commits to reintroducing measures from
the March budget, and includes campaign pledges that provide new
tax cuts for families and new funding for the French-speaking
province of  Quebec .  Harper’s most expensive pledge is a measure that would let
families with children under 18 split up to C$50,000 in income
for tax purposes. It would come into effect in 2014 and cost C$4
billion through March 2016.  The Conservative platform also budgets C$2.2 billion in
compensation to Quebec for harmonizing its  sales tax  with the
federal government. There is also new funding for the Canadian
Coast Guard, crime legislation, fishing and agriculture.  Harper’s government also pledged to drop its efforts to
create a single national securities regulator if the Supreme
Court rules against the plan in hearings to be held next week.  Fiscal Plan  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  released a five-year  fiscal
plan  in Ottawa on March 22 that projected a C$29.6 billion
deficit in the fiscal year that begins April 1, down from C$40.5
billion last year and a record C$55.6 billion two years ago. A
surplus was projected for the 2015-2016 fiscal year.  The Conservative platform projects a 2011-12 deficit of
C$30.3 billion, C$20.1 billion in 2012-13, and C$7.7 billion in
2013-14. It budgets a C$2.8 surplus in 2014-15 and C$5.1 billion
in 2015-16. The federal government’s fiscal year begins April 1.  The Canadian dollar has appreciated 2.4 percent against its
U.S. counterpart since the election was called, and the 30-year
government bond yield has increased to 3.84 percent from 3.70
percent. The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index has risen 1.3
percent. The election probably won’t shake “market confidence”
