Bank of Moscow climbed the most in
two weeks after Interfax reported the bank’s president and his
adviser sold a combined 20.3 percent stake in the lender.  The stock gained 7.3 percent to 1,047.9 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest advance since March 17.  Bank President Andrei Borodin and Lev Alaluyev sold the
stake, the news service said, citing a phone interview with
Borodin. Borodin declined to name the buyer or the price, or
when the transaction took place, according to the report.  VTB Group wasn’t the purchaser, a press official for the
state-controlled Russian lender’s press service said to
Bloomberg News by phone, declining to be identified in line with
corporate policy.  Natalya Dokuchaeva, a Bank of Moscow spokeswoman, wasn’t
immediately available for comment when called by Bloomberg on
her office or mobile phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
