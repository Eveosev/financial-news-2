China stocks rose, driving the
benchmark index to a five-month high, on speculation inflation
will ease and the economy is weathering tightening measures.  SAIC Motor Corp. jumped more than 8 percent, leading gains
for automakers on speculation sales increased last month.
Jiangxi Copper Co., the biggest copper producer, climbed the
most in three weeks as metal prices advanced. China Petroleum
and Chemical Corp. and China Shenhua Energy Co. led energy
producers higher as oil traded above $110 a barrel.  “Even though the government is facing a dilemma about
whether to sacrifice economic growth to fight inflation,
companies’ earnings outlooks haven’t been affected so far,”
said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co. “The
interest-rate increase earlier this week indicates there’s no
more monetary tightening coming at least for the short term.”  The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 22 points, or 0.7
percent, to 3,030.02 at 3 p.m., extending gains for the holiday-
shortened week to 2.1 percent. The measure closed at the highest
level since Nov. 11. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 0.9 percent to
3,353.36.  --Irene Shen. With assistance from Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen
