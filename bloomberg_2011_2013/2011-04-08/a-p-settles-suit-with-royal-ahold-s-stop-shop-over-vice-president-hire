Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (GAP) ,
the bankrupt grocery store operator, settled a lawsuit it filed
this week against Royal Ahold NV’s Stop & Shop Supermarket unit
for hiring its second most senior operations executive after he
agreed not to work for a competitor for 18 months.  Lawyers in the case said they settled the suit at a court
appearance today, according to the docket. Terms weren’t
disclosed.  A&P sued Stop & Shop and Frank R. Vitale, the former vice
president of operations, April 4 in federal court in Brooklyn,
 New York . It accused Vitale of disclosing trade secrets and
“key elements” of its restructuring strategy to its rival. It
sought $1 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in
punitive damages from Stop & Shop. Vitale resigned from A&P Feb.
14, according to the complaint.  A&P, based in Montvale,  New Jersey , filed for bankruptcy in
December after failing to turn around its business amid
increased competition from wholesale clubs and drugstores. It
operates supermarkets under names including Waldbaum’s, Food
Emporium and Pathmark.  Arlene Putterman, a Stop & Shop spokeswoman, and Eric C.
Andrus, an A&P spokesman, declined to comment.  The case is  Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (GAPTQ)  v. Stop & Shop
Supermarket Co., 11-cv-1641, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of New York (Brooklyn). A&P’s bankruptcy case is In re
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 10-24549,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
