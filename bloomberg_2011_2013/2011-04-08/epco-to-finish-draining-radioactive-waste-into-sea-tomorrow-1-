Tokyo  Electric Power Co. expects to
complete the release of radioactive water into the sea from a
waste treatment facility at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant
by the end of tomorrow, a spokesman for the power utility said.  The draining of radioactive water from pits outside the
Nos. 5 and 6 reactors at the plant is also expected to finish by
the end of tomorrow, Junichi Matsumoto, a spokesman for the
power utility told reporters in Tokyo today.  The conference followed Japan’s biggest aftershock since
the day of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that crippled the
plant. The magnitude-7.1 temblor struck at 11:32 p.m. local time
yesterday near the epicenter of last month’s quake, the  U.S.
Geological Survey  reported on its website.  The aftershock hindered efforts by Tepco to prevent
hydrogen explosions at the plant 220 kilometers (137 miles)
north of Tokyo. After an evacuation of 15 workers, engineers
returned to the plant to pump nitrogen into the No. 1 reactor.  No unusual conditions were observed at the Fukushima Dai-
Ichi nuclear station, according to statements by Tokyo Electric
and  Japan ’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. There have
been no indications of changes in radiation levels or damage at
the plant, Tokyo Electric spokesman Takashi Kurita said earlier
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
