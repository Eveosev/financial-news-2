Canada  unexpectedly lost jobs in
March for the first time in six months as a record drop in part-
time work outstripped the biggest gain in full-time positions in
a year.  Employment fell by 1,500, following gains of 15,100 and
69,200 in the prior two months,  Statistics Canada  said today in
Ottawa. The number was lower than forecast by all 25 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey that had a median estimate of a
28,000 gain. The unemployment rate declined to 7.7 percent from
7.8 percent as predicted, as the  labor force  shrank by 14,900.  Canada’s dollar remained higher after the report as
investors focused on the 90,600 gain in full-time work, which
was the biggest since September 2009. The increase almost offset
the 92,100 drop in part-time employment, which was the largest
in records dating to 1976. The currency traded at 95.64 cents
per  U.S. dollar  at 12:28 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.82 cents
yesterday. Earlier it was 95.27 cents, the strongest since 2007.  “The full-time job growth is the key takeaway,” said  Mark Chandler , head of fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank’s Capital
Markets unit in Toronto. “When you look at the first quarter as
a whole, you get a picture of decent job gains” that signals
annualized economic growth of about 3.5 percent, he said.  Last Piece  The economy has been a major issue in the May 2 election
campaign, with Prime Minister Stephen Harper saying his
Conservative government will protect a “fragile” recovery with
tax credits for small companies that create jobs. Today’s report
is the last major piece of economic data due before the Bank of
Canada’s April 12 interest-rate decision, and economists predict
the benchmark rate will remain unchanged at 1 percent.  “We are going to create jobs by lowering taxes and keeping
them down,” Harper said today in Mississauga, Ontario, where he
released his party’s election platform. “Raising business tax
rates on employers right now would hurt  job creation  and the
recovery.”  Employment at retailers and wholesalers fell by 19,900 in
March, and health care and social assistance jobs fell by
17,300. Public administration employment declined by 13,000 and
manufacturing jobs fell 9,400.  The biggest job gains were 36,200 for accommodation and
food services, and 24,300 in construction.  Atco Ltd. said March 23 it would design and build a 1,500-
person housing complex for Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. to help that
company rebuild a smelter in Kitimat, British Columbia.  While Harper has touted tax breaks for manufacturers and
small businesses that hire new workers, Liberal Leader  Michael Ignatieff  says he will reverse past and planned business tax
reductions, and create jobs through social spending instead.  “His priorities are jets, jails and corporate tax cuts,”
Ignatieff said of Harper today in Hamilton, Ontario. Harper’s
spending plans would siphon off money needed for health care,
Ignatieff said.  Conservatives Lead  The Conservatives were supported by 40.6 percent of decided
voters, followed by 31.1 percent who supported the Liberals,
according to a CTV/Globe/Nanos election survey published today.
The telephone survey of 1,200 people conducted April 5-7 has a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percent.  Unemployment won’t decline much this year, a separate
Bloomberg economist survey shows; the jobless rate will average
7.4 percent in the last three months of the year, according to
the median of 18 responses.  Nonetheless, the job market is stronger than in the U.S.,
Canada’s biggest trading partner. The  unemployment rate  in
Canada has been lower than in the U.S. since October 2008. The
U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly dropped to a two-year low of 8.8
percent in March, the Labor Department said April 1 in
 Washington .  Today’s report also showed that private companies boosted
their payrolls by 8,300 and public-sector employment fell by
27,200. Self-employment rose by 17,400 in March, while paid
employment decreased by 18,900.  “The details are firmer than the headline miss as full-
time jobs grew and so did jobs in the private sector, with the
net effect being a much firmer reading on hours worked,” said
 Derek Holt , an economist at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.  Average hourly wages advanced 2.7 percent in March from a
year earlier, after a 2.5 percent gain in February.  Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. also said today that
housing starts rose 2.8 percent in March, the third straight
gain, led by projects in rural areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
