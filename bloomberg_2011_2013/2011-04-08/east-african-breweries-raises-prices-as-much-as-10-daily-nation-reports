East African Breweries Ltd. (EABL)  raised
prices on its products by as much as 10 percent because of
rising raw-material and utility costs, the  Daily Nation 
reported, citing a company announcement.  The price of the companyâ€™s flagship Tusker lager will
increase to 95 shillings ($1.13) per 330 milliliter (0.6 pint)
bottle, while a 500 milliliter bottle of Guinness will increase
to 110 shillings from 100 shillings, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
