JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  paid $421,458
in expenses related to the sale of Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon ’s Chicago house, which went under contract in September
after more than three years on the market.  The total includes $306,000 for real estate commissions and
fees for the eight-bedroom mansion, the New York-based bank said
in a regulatory filing yesterday. The home, located in Chicago’s
Gold Coast neighborhood, sold for $6.8 million, according to
documents on the website of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds.  The payment was made “in accordance with the firm’s
general policy on relocation expenses, applicable to all
eligible employees who relocate at the request of the firm,”
according to the JPMorgan filing.  Dimon, 55, moved to  New York  after JPMorgan’s 2004 purchase
of Bank One Corp., and kept the Chicago house while his children
completed high school, according to the filing. He listed the
property for $13.5 million in April 2007 before cutting the
asking price multiple times to as low as $6.95 million.  Chicago-area  home prices  declined 25 percent from April
2007 through September, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index
of values in the region.  Dimon and his wife, Judith, bought the 15,000-square-foot
(1,390-square-meter) property in 2000 for $4.7 million,
according to county records. The mansion, which has nine full
bathrooms and a 900-square-foot terrace, was built in the late
1800s and is near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
