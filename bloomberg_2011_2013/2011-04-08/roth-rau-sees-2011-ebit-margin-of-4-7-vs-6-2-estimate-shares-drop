Roth & Rau AG (R8R) , a German maker of
solar-cell production equipment, forecast a 4 percent to 7
percent operating margin for this year compared with the 6.2
percent median of 12 analyst estimates on Bloomberg.  The stock pared losses as deep as 6.8 percent to end the
day up 3 percent, at 19.75 euros, in Frankfurt trading. The
forecast was made in the  annual report  released today by the
Hohenstein-based company and outlined its reorganization and
cost cuts made to emerge from operating losses last year.  Roth & Rau, with a market value of 315 million euros ($454
million), reiterated plans to return to profit this year and to
“modify” its five-year-old business of building production lines
for customers. Last year several couldn’t pay their bills after
government solar-power subsidies were slashed.  “The market for turnkey production lines has changed
fundamentally,” Chief Executive Officer Dietmar Roth said in
the report. “We clearly see the turnkey market on the
decline.”  The CEO said many of the company’s customers who are now in
default “based their plans for expansion on the Southern
European market,” where subsidies from markets including  Spain 
were reduced.  He forecast sales rising to 300 million euros to 325
million euros this year compared with the median analyst
estimate of 319 million euros. The shares have risen 57 percent
this year though they are down 25 percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
