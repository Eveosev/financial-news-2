Ukraine won’t impose another round
of quotas on grain exports if the next harvest is “good,”
Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  told Christopher Smart, the U.S.
Treasury’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Europe and Eurasia.  “Should Ukraine have a good harvest, there are not going
to be any limits,” Azarov told Smart yesterday at a meeting in
the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, according to a statement on the
Cabinet’s  website . The country’s farmers start harvesting winter
grains in late May.  Ukraine imposed limits on shipments of corn, wheat and
barley in October in a bid to limit domestic price increases
after drought damaged crops. The quotas, which total 6.2 million
metric tons, are in force through the end of the marketing year
on June 30. President  Viktor Yanukovych  told the government this
week to replace quotas with export duties.  The American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, a trade group
based in  Kiev , urged the Ukrainian government last month to
remove restrictions on the grains market and drop export quotas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
