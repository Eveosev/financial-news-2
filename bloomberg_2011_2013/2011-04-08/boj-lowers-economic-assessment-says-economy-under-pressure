Japan ’s economy is under “strong
downward pressure,” the  Bank of Japan  said in the monthly
economic assessment, lowering its evaluation for the first time
since October.  The economy will return to a moderate recovery path after
supply-side constraints ease and demand from reconstruction
emerges, the central bank said, repeating the language used in
yesterday’s policy statement. Exports will probably rise on the
back of higher overseas demand, the report said.  Spending on capital outlays, housing and public works
projects are expected to increase gradually, fueled by
reconstruction efforts, today’s report said. Private consumption
will also pick up when production recovers, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
