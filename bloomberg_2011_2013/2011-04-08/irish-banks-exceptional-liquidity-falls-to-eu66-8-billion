Central bank funding for the Irish
financial system may have fallen by as much as 5.7 billion euros
($8.2 billion) in March, according to data published today.  Lenders may have borrowed as much as 66.8 billion euros in
exceptional liquidity from the Irish central bank as of March
25, down from as much as 70.1 billion euros to Feb. 25, a report
on Dublin-based central bank’s website  showed. Borrowings from
the  European Central Bank  fell to 114.5 billion euros from 116.9
billion euros during the same period.  With investors shunning Irish debt and deposits ebbing, the
country’s financial system became reliant on central banks over
the past year. In an effort to shore up confidence, the Irish
central bank on March 31 ordered four lenders to raise 24
billion euros after stress tests conducted as part of the
country’s international bailout in November.  The central bank has said the “other assets” category,
which covers lending to Irish banks, includes “exceptional
liquidity assistance lending,” without giving more details.
This liquidity makes up the bulk of the category, according to a
senior central bank official, who declined to be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
