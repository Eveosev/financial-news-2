Former D.B. Zwirn & Co. Chief
Financial Officer Perry Gruss was sued by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission over allegations he “knowingly
misused” $870 million in clients’ funds.  The commission said that from March 2004 to July 2006,
Gruss misused the signatory and approval authority he had over
funds held in client accounts of D.B. Zwirn & Co. The defunct,
New York-based hedge-fund firm once managed $5 billion.  Gruss “authorized more than $870 million in improper
transfers of client cash, both between client funds and from
client funds to the  investment adviser  and third parties,” the
SEC said in the complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
New York.  Regulators said Gruss directed or approved transfers from
the fund that included: transferring $576 million from March
2004 to July 2006 from the Offshore Fund to an entity known as
the Onshore fund; transferring $273 million from June 2005 to
May 2006 from the Offshore fund to pay a revolving credit
facility of the fund.  The SEC also alleged Gruss improperly withdrew $22 million
in management fees from May 2004 to March 2006 from accounts of
client hedge funds to cover operating shortfalls. In September
2005, he withdrew $3.8 million to pay a portion of the purchase
of a $17.95 million Gulfstream IV aircraft bought by an unnamed
D.B. Zwirn managing partner, according to the complaint.  ‘Categorically Denies’  “Mr. Gruss categorically denies the allegations in the
SEC’s complaint as being completely without merit,” Nick
Akerman, a lawyer for Gruss, said in an e-mailed statement. “At
all times Mr. Gruss acted in the best interests of the
shareholders and there is not even an allegation that he
obtained any financial gain whatsoever from any of the
transactions alleged in the complaint.”  In March 2007, the SEC began an investigation to determine
if there had been improper money transfers and overcharging of
clients under Gruss.  The SEC began its investigation after D.B. Zwirn came to
the agency with results of an internal review it began in
October 2006, the firm said in a letter to clients obtained by
Bloomberg News. Gruss stepped down that month.  In 2009, Gruss sued D.B. Zwirn, denying the allegations
that he mismanaged clients’ funds. Gruss also said that Zwirn
had made him a “scapegoat” for issues at the firm. That suit
is pending in federal court in  New York .  The case is SEC v. Perry Gruss, 11-cv-02420, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
