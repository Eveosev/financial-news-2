Japanese stocks gained, sending the
Nikkei 225 Stocks Average higher for a third consecutive week,
on growing speculation damage from yesterday’s 7.1 magnitude
aftershock was limited.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest listed
lender, gained 3.2 percent. Tokyo Electric Power Co., the
operator of a crippled nuclear power plant, surged 24 percent
after saying it may cancel scheduled power blackouts this
summer. Fast Retailing Co. jumped 7.3 percent after boosting its
earnings forecast. Seven & I Holdings Co., owner of the 7-Eleven
convenience-store brand, climbed 1.9 percent after reporting net
income more than doubled.  The Nikkei 225 gained 1.9 percent to 9,768.08 as of the
close of trading in Tokyo after falling as much as 0.6 percent
earlier. The measure climbed 0.6 percent this week, its third
weekly increase in a row. The benchmark gauge has fallen about
6.4 percent since March 10, a day before a record magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami struck  Japan . The broader Topix index
advanced 1.4 percent to 853.13 today, with about seven shares
rising for each that fell on the 1,666-member gauge.  “The market initially expected the effects of the
aftershock last night to be like the huge earthquake last
month,” said  Yuuki Sakurai , president at Fukoku Capital
Management Inc., which manages the equivalent of $8.6 billion in
Tokyo. “But as the day went on they slowly realized it wasn’t
as bad. Considering the strength of the magnitude, the damage
wasn’t that much, which is being seen as positive.”  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
today. U.S. stocks fell yesterday, dragging the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  down from an almost three-year high,
following the earthquake in Japan and a dispute over the federal
budget threatened to shut down the U.S. government.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  posted its biggest two-day plunge since the
1987 crash on March 14 and March 15 after the quake and tsunami
on March 11 killed or left missing more than 27,000 people and
prompted radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant. Shares on the measure now trade at
14.7 times estimated earnings, compared with about 18 times at
the start of the year.  The 7.1-magnitude aftershock minutes before midnight
yesterday spared the Fukushima plant, although workers
struggling to cool radioactive fuel were evacuated, Tepco said,
based on its initial assessment. The aftershock was the
strongest since the March 11 quake. No unusual conditions were
observed at the plant, the utility and Japan’s Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency said in statements.  ‘Acting Calm’  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial gained 3.2 percent to 393 yen, the
biggest support to the Topix index today. Mitsubishi Estate Co.,
the country’s biggest developer by market value, advanced 3.7
percent to 1,389 yen. Komatsu Ltd., Japan’s largest construction
machinery maker, increased 2.2 percent to 2,785 yen.  “The market may not have digested everything from the
quake last night, but it’s acting calm compared with the March
11 quake,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist in Tokyo
at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees $84
billion. “It’s not as big as the March 11 disaster, and the
negative effects don’t look as bad.”  Tokyo Electric Power, the operator of the crippled nuclear
power plant in Fukushima prefecture, surged 24 percent to 420
yen. The company, also known as Tepco, said it would try to
avoid rolling blackouts that were planned for this summer, as
its supply may be able to meet demand, the company said.  Removing Uncertainty  “As it was seen to be a squeeze for company earnings in
July to September, this has removed some uncertainty,” said
Yoshihisa Okamoto, who helps oversee about $34 billion at Tokyo-
based Mizuho Asset Management Co. “It helped to push up the
market in the afternoon.”  Fast Retailing, the operator of the Uniqlo casual-clothing
chain, jumped 7.3 percent to 11,940, the biggest single boost to
the Nikkei 225. Net income may total 60 billion yen ($703
million) in the year ending Aug. 31, compared with an earlier
forecast for profit of 51 billion yen, the Yamaguchi, Japan-
based company said yesterday.  Seven & I Holdings Co., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience-
store brand, rose 1.9 percent to 2,112 yen. The retailer said
full-year net income more than doubled to 112 billion yen from
44.9 billion yen a year earlier.  “The effects of the earthquake on earnings really depends
company to company,” Ishigane said. “Some companies may find
they are hardly affected at all.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
