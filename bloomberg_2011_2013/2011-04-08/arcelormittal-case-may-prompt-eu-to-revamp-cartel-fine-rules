ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s 80-percent cut in
cartel fines may trigger an overhaul of European Union rules
that hold parent companies responsible for their units’
competition violations, the region’s antitrust chief said.  The world’s biggest steelmaker this week won a reduction of
nearly 185 million euros ($267 million) after the European
Commission said it couldn’t force the company to pay the share
of the overall penalty earmarked for some of its units.  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s competition commissioner, said
regulators will no longer set a maximum amount for fines on
subsidiaries of 10 percent of the parent company’s yearly
revenue.  “I don’t want to impose a fine that is five or six times
higher than the revenue figures of the company,” Almunia told a
competition law conference in  St. Gallen ,  Switzerland  today.
“If this requires a revision of the guidelines, I will revise
the guidelines on this point.”  EU regulators have recently raised their penalties against
parent companies, saying they are liable for competition-law
violations by their units.  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) , the world’s largest
maker of paints and coatings, lost an appeal in 2009 over its
financial liability for a unit’s violations.  ArcelorMittal is an exception because “we realized from
the legal point of view we would not be able to ask for this
joint and several liability” which would require the
Luxembourg-based parent to pay fines levied last year on French,
Italian and Belgian units, Almunia said.  The total fines were reduced to 45.7 million euros from
230.4 million euros under “inability-to-pay” rules that cut a
financial penalty that is likely to bankrupt a company, Almunia
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
