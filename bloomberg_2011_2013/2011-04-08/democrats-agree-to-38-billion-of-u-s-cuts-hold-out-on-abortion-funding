Democrats have agreed to $38 billion
in U.S. budget cuts, and funding for Planned Parenthood remains
the only policy sticking point in talks aimed at avoiding a
government shutdown tonight, Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
told reporters.  “We have worked out every other rider” on policy issues
aside from Republicans’ insistence on halting money for Planned
Parenthood, said Reid, a Nevada Democrat. “If they back off
from this ideological issue that is holding up this country,
we have a number agreed upon.”  Democrats had earlier offered $33 billion in cuts for a
spending bill to keep the government operating through
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
