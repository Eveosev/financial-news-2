Bulgaria’s parliament reappointed
Dimitar Kostov as deputy central bank governor for another six-
year term.  Bulgarian lawmakers voted 143 to 10 votes re-elect Kostov,
who oversees the banking department, which acts as lender of
last resort in the case of systemic risk in the industry. His
first term in office ends on June 11, according to the central
bank’s  website .  Bulgaria has run a currency board system since 1997, which
pegs the lev to the euro and requires foreign-exchange reserves
to cover all lev in circulation. Foreign-exchange reserves stood
at the equivalent of 23.9 billion lev ($17.5 billion) at the end
of March.  Lenders based in other European Union countries control 85
percent of banking assets in the Balkan nation. The five biggest
banks are UniCredit Bulbank; DSK Bank, a unit of OTP Bank Nyrt.,
 Hungary ’s largest bank; United Bulgarian Bank, owned by  National
Bank of Greece SA (ETE) ; Raiffeisenbank Bulgaria and Eurobank EFG
