Somali Prime Minister Mohamed
Abdullahi Mohamed said United Nations agencies based in
neighboring  Kenya  for safety reasons should return to Somalia
within three months, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Security in Mogadishu, the capital, has improved after
African Union-backed government forces seized back territory in
the city from the al-Shabaab militia, the London-based
broadcaster cited Mohamed as saying.  UN envoy to Somalia Augustine Mahiga said Mohamed’s
announcement was “ambitious,” the  BBC  said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
