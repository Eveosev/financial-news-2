Slovakia â€™s public-finance deficit
widened to 7.78 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 as
revenue fell short and municipal spending exceeded projections,
the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall, which on top of the central budget includes
municipal finances and welfare, compares with a projected gap of
4.5 percent of GDP and 8 percent in 2009, when the economy
experienced its first-ever full-year recession. Public-sector
debt at the end of last year represented 41 percent of GDP, up
from 35.4 percent in 2009, the  ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement from Bratislava, Slovakia today.  Even as the economy in Slovakia, which adopted the euro in
2009, emerged from a recession last year, the export-driven
recovery failed to create jobs and caused tax revenue to fall
460 million euros ($663 million) short of target. Municipal
budgets exceeded the planned deficit by 591 million euros, while
112 million euros in unplanned spending was related to flooding,
the ministry said.  The results are preliminary and need to be approved by
Eurostat, the ministry said. The statistical office of the
European Union will release the final data April 26.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
