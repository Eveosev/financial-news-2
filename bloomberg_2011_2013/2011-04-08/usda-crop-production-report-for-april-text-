Following is the text of the U.S.
Crop Production report for April from the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture :  Orange Production Up 1 Percent from March  The United States all orange forecast for the 2010-2011 season is
8.91 million tons, up 1 percent from the March 1 forecast and 8 percent above
the revised 2009-2010 final utilization. The  Florida  all orange forecast, at
142 million boxes (6.39 million tons), is unchanged from the March 1 forecast
but 6 percent above last season's revised final utilization. Early,
midseason, and navel varieties in Florida are forecast at 70.0 million boxes
(3.15 million tons), unchanged from March but 2 percent higher than last
season. The Florida Valencia orange forecast, at 72.0 million boxes
(3.24 million tons), is unchanged from the previous forecast but up
11 percent from the revised 2009-2010 crop. In Florida, fruit size is
projected to be below average while droppage is projected to be above
average.  The  California  all orange forecast is 61.0 million boxes (2.44 million tons),
up 3 percent from the previous forecast and up 6 percent from last season's
revised final utilization. The California navel orange forecast is
48.0 million boxes (1.92 million tons), up 3 percent from the March 1
forecast and up 13 percent from last season. The California Valencia orange
forecast is 13.0 million boxes (520,000 tons), unchanged from the previous
forecast but down 13 percent from last season's revised final utilization.
Harvest of navel oranges continued during March, while Valencia orange
harvest got underway. The Texas orange forecast, at 1.77 million boxes
(75,000 tons), is up 8 percent from the previous forecast and up 8 percent
from last season's final utilization.  Florida frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) yield forecast for the
2010-2011 season is 1.58 gallons per box at 42.0 degrees Brix, up 1 percent
from the March 1 forecast and up 1 percent from last season's final yield of
1.56 gallons per box. The early-midseason portion is projected at
1.52 gallons per box, up 1 percent from last season's yield of 1.51 gallons
per box. The Valencia portion is projected at 1.65 gallons per box, 1 percent
higher than last year's final yield of 1.63 gallons per box. All projections
of yield assume the processing relationships this season will be similar to
those of the past several seasons.  Crop Area Planted and Harvested -  United States : 2010 and 2011 (Domestic Units)

3/    Area is total hectares in crop, not harvested hectares.  March Weather Summary  During March, warm, dry weather across the southern Plains and the Southwest
adversely affected already drought-stressed pastures and winter grains. From
November 28 to April 3, the portion of the winter wheat crop rated in very
poor to poor condition climbed from 26 to 61 percent in Texas; 8 to
53 percent in  Oklahoma ; and 25 to 34 percent in  Kansas .  In contrast, cold weather dominated the Nation's Northern Tier, particularly
on the northern Plains. Monthly temperatures ranged from more than 5 degrees
Fahrenheit below normal on the northern Plains to more than 5 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal in parts of the Southwest. By month's end, winter
wheat in the northern Plains had begun to break dormancy, with 70 percent of
 Montana 's wheat crop rated in good to excellent condition on April 3.  As the month progressed, flooding generally shifted from the Ohio Valley (and
parts of the Northeast) into the upper Midwest. In the latter region, the
mid- to late-month combination of precipitation and melting snow led to
significant flooding, especially in eastern  South Dakota  and southern
 Minnesota .  Meanwhile, March rainfall provided drought relief in parts of the Southeast.
Heavy precipitation fell from the central  Gulf Coast  into the Appalachians,
as well as the Northeast. Late-month rain eased drought in parts of Florida,
with downpours affecting central portions of the peninsula.  Elsewhere, a series of exceptional, late-season storms hammered northern and
central California and the Northwest, while drought continued to expand and
intensify across  Arizona  and  New Mexico . The average water content of the
high-elevation Sierra Nevada snow pack peaked at 48 inches (165 percent of
normal) in late March, up from 22 inches in mid-February.  March Agricultural Summary  The arrival of March brought seasonable temperatures to much of the Nation.
In contrast, portions of the northern Great Plains and  Rocky Mountains 
experienced temperatures more than 10 degrees below average. While
precipitation was above average along both coasts and in isolated locations
across the Northern Tier, many areas in the center of the country accumulated
less than 50 percent of their normal rainfall totals during the month.  As the month began and when weather conditions allowed, row crop producers in
many regions of the United States were completing tillage operations,
irrigating fields, and performing routine equipment maintenance in
preparation for spring planting. In portions of the South, some corn, cotton,
and sorghum acreage was already in the ground. By mid-month, a prolonged lack
of rainfall coupled with inadequate soil moisture availability delayed
planting activities across southern  Texas  and left emerged corn in the
Coastal Bend in need of additional precipitation to further normal crop
development. Elsewhere, rice producers in California were busy working on
drainage ditches to help eliminate excess water from their fields following
steady rainfall during the first half of March. By month's end, corn, cotton,
rice, and sorghum planting was underway in several States.  While small grain fields in California were growing well with adequate to
abundant available soil moisture at the start of the month, persistently dry
conditions on the central and southern Great Plains left many winter wheat
fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas in very poor or poor condition at
month's end. In Kansas, the largest winter wheat-producing State, jointing
was evident in a small number fields by March 13. Producers in the High
Plains of Texas treated some fields for brown wheat mites, Russian wheat
aphids, and winter grain mites as portions of the crop in the Low Plains were
negatively impacted by soil erosion and strong winds. In Oklahoma, some small
grain fields were appraised for insurance purposes while producers were
considering grazing others. Elsewhere, as the month ended, dairy operations
in  Georgia  were harvesting some small grain fields for silage.  Crop Comments  Grapefruit: The 2010-2011 United States grapefruit crop is forecast at
1.21 million tons, up 1 percent from the March 1 forecast but down 2 percent
from the 2009-2010 crop.  Florida grapefruit production is forecast at 19.6 million boxes
(833,000 tons), unchanged from the previous forecast but down 3 percent from
last season. The Florida all white grapefruit forecast is 5.60 million boxes
(238,000 tons), down 7 percent from the 2009-2010 season. The colored
grapefruit forecast, at 14.0 million boxes (595,000 tons), is 2 percent below
last season.  Tangerines and mandarins: The United States tangerine and mandarin crop is
forecast at 610,000 tons, up 1 percent from the March 1 forecast and up
3 percent from the previous season. Florida's tangerine crop is forecast at
4.50 million boxes (214,000 tons), up 2 percent from the previous forecast
and up 1 percent from the previous season.  Lemons: The forecast for the 2010-2011 United States lemon crop is
940,000 tons, unchanged from the January 1 forecast but up 7 percent from the
2009-2010 final utilization. California production is forecast at
840,000 tons (21.0 million boxes), unchanged from the previous forecast but
up 5 percent from last season's revised utilized production. Harvest ended in
the Desert Region while picking continued in the San Joaquin Valley. Lemon
production in Arizona is forecast at 100,000 tons (2.50 million boxes),
unchanged from the January 1 forecast but up 19 percent from last season.  Tangelos: Florida's tangelo forecast is 1.15 million boxes (52,000 tons), up
5 percent from the March 1 forecast and up 28 percent from last season's
final utilization.  Florida citrus: In the citrus growing areas, temperatures were predominantly
in the 80s during the month. Weather stations reported lows from the 30s to
the 50s, with highs reaching the 90 degree range. Drought conditions worsened
during March, with light rainfall having little effect on improving soil
moisture. The citrus bloom was heavy and widespread with reports of a good
fruit set.  Citrus growers reported harvest of early and midseason oranges neared
completion. Grapefruit continued to be picked on schedule. Nearly all of the
processing plants are open. Valencia oranges and grapefruit made up the
majority of fruit going to the plants. Heavy irrigation and harvesting
dominated the grove activities during the month.  Arizona citrus: Lemon and tangerine harvest finished in March.  Texas citrus: Dry conditions persisted throughout the growing region in
March. Harvest of navel and Valencia oranges and grapefruit continued with
excellent fruit quality being reported.  California citrus: The navel orange, mandarin, and lemon harvests continued
in the San Joaquin Valley, along with early varieties of Valencia oranges.
Lemons and grapefruit continued to be picked in the Desert Region, while
lemons were picked in the Coastal Region as well. Harvest of navel oranges
finished early to limit fruit losses due to rind breakdown. Nurseries in
Tulare County shipped citrus plants across the State.  California noncitrus fruits and nuts: Stone fruit and cherry bloom was
underway with most farmers performing bloom spray applications. Early grape
varieties showed bud break and strawberry plants showed good growth in the
San Joaquin Valley. Pre-emergent herbicides were applied in grape vineyards
along with ongoing pruning. Fertilizers and herbicides application continued
in orchards across the State.  Irrigation water was applied to almond orchards across the Central Valley to
limit the effects of freezing temperatures on almond buds. Blooming continued
in the San Joaquin Valley while it was finished in the Sacramento Valley.
Sprays were applied in almond orchards along with pruning as weather allowed.
Pruning and spraying in pistachio and walnut orchards continued as well when
field conditions allowed. Planting of new nut trees was ongoing.  Spring potatoes: Production for 2011 is forecast at 25.8 million cwt, up
4 percent from 2010. Area for harvest is forecast at 89,500 acres, up
4 percent from last year. The average yield forecast, at 289 cwt per acre, is
unchanged from 2010.  Florida's production is forecast at 8.62 million cwt, up 8 percent from last
year. Unfavorable weather conditions caused some freeze damage in the other
areas growing region. However, Hastings area growers expect a good crop.
California's spring potato production is forecast at 10.8 million cwt, down
1 percent from the previous year due to cool, wet growing conditions.
North Carolina growers are expected to produce 3.52 million cwt of spring
potatoes, up 20 percent from 2010. As of March 27, 2011, crop condition was
rated as mostly good by the growers. Production in Arizona is forecast at
1.14 million, up 10 percent from 2010, while Texas growers expect production
to total 1.73 million cwt, down 13 percent from last year.  Summer potatoes: The final estimate of 2010 summer potato production is
11.6 million cwt, up 1 percent from the preliminary estimate in the January
Crop Production 2010 Summary. Harvested area covered 37,500 acres, up
1 percent from the preliminary 2010 estimate. The revised acreage yield of
310 cwt per acre is down 1 cwt form the 2010 preliminary estimate.  Statistical Methodology  Survey procedures: The orange objective yield survey for the April 1 forecast
was conducted in Florida, which accounts for nearly 75 percent of the United
States production. Bearing tree numbers are determined at the start of the
season based on a fruit tree census conducted every other year, combined with
ongoing review based on administrative data or special surveys. From mid-July
to mid-September, the number of fruit per tree is determined. In September
and subsequent months, fruit size measurement and fruit droppage surveys are
conducted, which, when combined with the previous components, are used to
develop the current forecast of production. California and Texas conduct
grower and packer surveys on a quarterly basis in October, January, April,
and July. California also conducts objective measurement surveys in September
for navel oranges and in March for Valencia oranges.  Estimating procedures: State level objective yield estimates for Florida
oranges were reviewed for errors, reasonableness, and consistency with
historical estimates. Reports from growers and packers in California and
Texas were also used for setting estimates. These three States submit their
analyses of the current situation to the Agricultural Statistics Board (ASB).
The ASB uses the survey data and the State analyses to prepare the published
April 1 forecast.  Revision policy: The April 1 production forecasts will not be revised. A new
forecast will be made each month throughout the growing season. End-of-season
estimates will be published in the Citrus Fruits Summary released in
September. The production estimates are based on all data available at the
end of the marketing season, including information from marketing orders,
shipments, and processor records. Allowances are made for recorded local
utilization and home use.  Reliability: To assist users in evaluating the reliability of the April 1
production forecasts, the "Root Mean Square Error," a statistical measure
based on past performance, is computed. The deviation between the April 1
production forecast and the final estimate is expressed as a percentage of
the final estimate. The average of squared percentage deviations for the
latest 20-year period is computed. The square root of the average becomes
statistically the "Root Mean Square Error." Probability statements can be
made concerning expected differences in the current forecast relative to the
final end-of-season estimate, assuming that factors affecting this year's
forecast are not different from those influencing recent years.  The "Root Mean Square Error" for the April 1 orange production forecast is
1.7 percent regardless of including or excluding the 4 abnormal production
seasons (2 freeze seasons and 2 hurricane seasons). This means that chances
are 2 out of 3 that the current orange production forecast will not be above
or below the final estimates by more than 1.7 percent. Chances are
9 out of 10 (90 percent confidence level) that the difference will not exceed
2.9 percent, or 3.0 percent, excluding abnormal seasons.  Changes between the April 1 orange forecast and the final estimates during
the past 20 years have averaged 146,000 tons (154,000 tons, excluding
abnormal seasons), ranging from 7,000 tons to 368,000 tons (7,000 tons to
368,000 tons, excluding abnormal seasons). The April 1 forecast for oranges
has been below the final estimate 7 times and above 13 times (below 5 times
and above 11 times, excluding abnormal seasons). The difference does not
imply that the April 1 forecast this year is likely to understate or
overstate final production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
