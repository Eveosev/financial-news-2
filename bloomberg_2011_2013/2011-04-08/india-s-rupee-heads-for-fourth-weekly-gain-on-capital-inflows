India ’s rupee headed for a fourth
weekly gain as overseas funds boosted holdings of the country’s
shares to take advantage of its economic growth outlook.  The currency climbed to the highest level in almost six
months as overseas investors bought $1.4 billion more Indian
stocks than they sold this month through April 6, exchange data
show. The $1.3 trillion economy will expand as much as 9.25
percent this financial year started April 1, the most since 2008,
according to a government forecast.  “The inflows in the equity market have been pretty
strong,” said Krishnamurthy Harihar, treasurer at FirstRand Ltd.
in Mumbai. “The rupee has strengthened for quite some time on
capital inflows and export growth.”  The rupee advanced 1.3 percent this week to 44.02 per
dollar as of 9:20 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It gained 0.4 percent today and touched 44.00, the
strongest level since October 15.  India’s exports rose 49.7 percent in February from a year
earlier, after a 32.4 percent gain in January, commerce ministry
data show this month.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.65 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 44.84
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
