OAO Novolipetsk Steel, Russian
billionaire  Vladimir Lisin ’s steelmaker, agreed to sell its
Independent Transportation Co. unit to UCL Rail BV, a unit of
 Universal Cargo Logistics Holding BV , for $325 million in cash.  UCL will also take on Independent Transportation’s $236
million of debt, Novolipetsk said in a statement today. The sale
is in line with the steelmaker’s goal of selling assets that
aren’t core to its business, it said.  Novolipetsk has a long-term agreement with Independent
Transportation, ensuring the company’s transportation needs will
be fully met, it said. UCL owns stakes in shipping companies,
ports and terminals, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
