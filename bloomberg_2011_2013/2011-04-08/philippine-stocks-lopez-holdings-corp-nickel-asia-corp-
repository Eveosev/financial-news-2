Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the noon close in Manila.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 0.5 percent to
4,241.01, the highest since Nov. 9.  Robinsons Land Corp. (RLC)  , the nation’s second-biggest
shopping mall operator, declined 2.7 percent to 12.86 pesos,
ending a six-day, 15 percent rally. The stock’s 14-day relative
strength index climbed to 70.3 yesterday, the highest since Nov.
4 and above the 70 level that some traders use as a signal to
sell.  “The stock has moved up sharply in a short time, making it
inviting for some investors to take off money from the table,”
said Astro del Castillo, managing director at Manila-based
advisory firm First Grade Holdings Inc.  Universal Robina Corp. (URC)  , the largest Philippine
snack-food maker, climbed the most in six months on speculation
lower raw-material costs will boost profit. The stock surged 8.9
percent to 39 pesos, the steepest gain since Oct. 8. Wheat
futures dropped 1.1 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade
yesterday on speculation favorable weather will boost U.S. crops.  “A decline in wheat can help boost margins as flour is a
significant raw material for Universal Robina,” said Alex Pomento, head of research at the  Manila  unit of Macquarie Group
Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
