Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the investment
bank that has been expanding its advisory and trading units,
raised $490 million in a common stock offering.  Jefferies offered 20.6 million shares priced at $24.25 a
share, the New York-based firm said in a statement today. The
company agreed yesterday to acquire Prudential Bache’s Global
Commodities Group for about $430 million.  “This offering kills two birds with one stone and will be
positive past the immediate term,” Douglas Sipkin, an analyst
at Ticonderoga Securities LLC, wrote in a note. “Jefferies
raises cash for the deal and gets to improve its balance
sheet.”  Jefferies, JPMorgan Securities LLC, Natixis Securities
North America Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are the
joint book-running managers of the offering, according to the
statement.  Jefferies  shares  fell 30 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $24.41
at 9:46 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
