Asian stocks advanced, driving the
regional benchmark index to its highest level since last month’s
earthquake, on speculation damage was limited from yesterday’s
7.1 magnitude aftershock in  Japan  and that engineering companies
may benefit from efforts to rebuild the country.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the South Korean shipbuilder
that also supplies industrial machinery and construction
equipment, climbed 3.6 percent in Seoul. Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, gained 1.4 percent in  Tokyo  after
saying it will resume output at its factories in Japan on April
18 after halting production following the March 11 earthquake.
 Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s biggest offshore oil explorer, increased 1.5
percent in  Hong Kong  as oil topped $110 a barrel.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.9 percent to 136.51
as of 4:49 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for its highest close since
March 9. The gauge is headed for a 0.9 percent advance this week,
its third consecutive weekly gain. Almost two stocks rose for
each that fell in the index.  “Investors are looking at a scenario that there will be
reconstruction opportunities in Japan, but I think the issues
will be more far-reaching,” said  Pauline Dan , Hong Kong-based
chief investment officer at Samsung Asset Management, which
oversees about $72 billion. “Aside from the risk of nuclear
fallout from Japan, we are still faced with a much higher
inflationary situation because of higher demand for fuel and
food.”  The Asia-Pacific benchmark gauge has risen for three weeks
as Japanese companies resumed production after last month’s
quake and Chinese firms posted profits that beat analyst
estimates.  ‘Wasn’t as Bad’  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 1.9 percent,
erasing losses of as much as 0.6 percent earlier.  South Korea ’s
Kospi Index increased 0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
rose 0.6 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index and
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index both increased 0.7 percent.  “The market initially expected the effects of the
aftershock last night to be like the huge earthquake last month,
but as the day went on they slowly realized it wasn’t as bad,”
said  Yuuki Sakurai , president at Fukoku Capital Management Inc.,
which manages the equivalent of $8.6 billion in Tokyo.
“Considering the strength of the magnitude, the damage wasn’t
that much, which is being seen as positive.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  on March 14 and March 15 posted its biggest
two-day plunge since the 1987 stock-market crash after the quake
and tsunami on March 11 left more than 27,000 people dead or
missing and caused radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant. Through yesterday, the
benchmark gauge has fallen 8.1 percent since March 10.  Yesterday’s 7.1-magnitude earthquake, which struck minutes
before midnight, spared the Fukushima plant, although workers
struggling to cool radioactive fuel were evacuated, Tokyo
Electric said. No additional damage was observed at the plant
afterward, the utility and Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety
Agency said in statements. The aftershock was the strongest
since March 11.  Biggest Advance  A gauge of industrial engineering companies posted the
biggest advance among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index, all of which gained. Tokyo Electric surged 24
percent to 420 yen, paring its plunge since the earthquake to 80
percent.  Hyundai Heavy increased 3.6 percent to 547,000 won in  Seoul .
Samsung Engineering Co., the builder of petrochemical plants and
industrial facilities, climbed 4.5 percent to 231,000 won. Japan
Steel Works Ltd., a supplier of machinery used in oil refineries
and petrochemical plants jumped 9.5 percent to 646 yen in Japan.  Toyota rose 1.4 percent to 3,340 yen. Toyota will reopen
production at 50 percent of full operating capacity and continue
manufacturing through April 27, said  Paul Nolasco , a spokesman
for the Toyota City, Japan-based carmaker. The company hasn’t
decided on a production plan after Japan’s Golden Week holidays
in early May, he said.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.4
percent today. The gauge lost 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday
and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated from an almost
three-year high as a dispute over the federal budget threatened
to shut down the American government.  Fast Retailing  Fast Retailing Co., the operator of the Uniqlo casual-
clothing chain, advanced 7.3 percent to 11,940 yen. The retailer
raised its full-year net income forecast by 18 percent to 60
billion yen ($703 million) on overseas growth and lower costs.
Also, the company said it will form a venture with Mitsubishi
Corp. to operate Uniqlo clothing stores in  Thailand .  Energy producers gained as oil headed for a third week of
gains in New York after climbing above $110 a barrel as a fire
burned at  Libya ’s Sarir field, heightening concern that
spreading conflict in North Africa and the Middle East will
disrupt supplies. Crude for May delivery rose as much as 1.1
percent to $111.48 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , and was at $111.39 at 3:45 p.m. Tokyo
time.  Cnooc climbed 1.5 percent to HK$21 in Hong Kong.  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas producer,
increased 0.7 percent to A$47.26. Rival Santos Ltd. gained 0.6
percent to A$16.28.  SGX Bid Rejected  SK Holdings Co., the parent of oil refiner SK Innovation
Co., surged 12 percent to 178,000 won. Samsung Securities Co.
raised its share-price forecast by 23 percent to 273,000 won,
saying the stock is “excessively” undervalued.  Singapore Exchange  Ltd., operator of the city’s securities
exchange, gained 2.6 percent to S$8.36 after Australian
Treasurer Wayne Swan said the government rejected Singapore
Exchange’s bid for bourse operator ASX Ltd. Both bourses
terminated their merger agreement.  “The prevailing market price has been factoring in a
potentially overpriced deal,” Simon Ng, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd., wrote in a note to
clients. “With the deal being called off for good, the stock
price is on track to an easier way up.” Singapore Exchange
offered to buy ASX on Oct. 25 in a cash and share deal then
valued at A$8.4 billion ($8.8 billion), a 42 percent premium to
ASX’s share price.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6 percent by the S&P
500 and 1.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
