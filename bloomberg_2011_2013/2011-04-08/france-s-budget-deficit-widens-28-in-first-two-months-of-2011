France ’s budget deficit widened more
than 28 percent in the first two months of 2011 as the nation’s
treasury paid out funds to Greece as part of  Europe ’s financial
support for the country and shifted to a new method of financing
local governments.  The shortfall expanded to 28 billion euros ($40.3 billion)
in January and February, up from 21.8 billion a year earlier,
the budget ministry said today in an emailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
