Commodities rose for a seventh day
to a two-year high, led by cotton and silver, on optimism about
economic recovery and a weaker dollar. Gold and tin climbed to
records.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw-materials 
futures reached 757.22 points, the highest level since Aug. 4,
2008. It was up 1.6 percent at 756.57 by 8:44 a.m. New York
time, for a weekly gain of 3.4 percent, on course for the
biggest increase in five weeks. Silver for immediate delivery
touched $40.30 an ounce, and cotton reached $2.124 a pound.  “The move today is just another step in the longer-term
story,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Strong industrial demand, high
economic optimism, a weaker  U.S. dollar  and ample liquidity
continue to support commodity prices.”  China, the world’s biggest copper consumer, can expand at 8
percent a year for the next two decades, the  World Bank  said
March 23. Industrial use of silver may climb to a record this
year, researcher GFMS said yesterday. The  Federal Reserve  last
month stuck to plans to buy $600 billion of Treasuries, and the
 Bank of England  yesterday maintained the size of bond purchases.  Raw materials from soybeans to crude oil advanced, lifting
lead and aluminum to the highest prices since 2008. Corn reached
a 33-month high in Chicago trading yesterday.  Slumping Dollar  Prices also gained as the dollar weakened, stoking demand
for commodities as an alternative investment and making raw
materials priced in the currency cheaper in terms of other
monies. The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, fell as much as 0.6 percent to the lowest
level since December 2009.  “All commodities are much higher, irrespective of
fundamentals,” Walter de Wet, head of commodities research at
Standard Bank Plc in  London , said by telephone. “Clearly there
is a common factor, and it seems to be the dollar.”  The dollar dropped to the lowest since January 2010 versus
the euro after the European Central Bank yesterday boosted
borrowing costs for the first time in almost three years to
combat inflation.  “Crude oil, of course, is pushing higher on the back of
Middle East, gold and silver are moving on inflationary concern,
and base metals are also finding support in what we see is a
combination of short-covering and the dollar,” de Wet said.
“Looking at the way the dollar is weakening, I think we might
test a bit higher for commodities.”  Short-covering denotes reversals of bets on declining
prices.  Borrowing Costs  China ’s central bank on April 5 raised  interest rates  for
the fourth increase in less than six months, acting before a
report forecast to show consumer prices climbed 5.2 percent last
month from a year before, the fastest pace since 2008. Interest-
rate futures imply that investors expect two more ECB rate
increases by the end of the year as inflation speeds up.  Crude oil for May delivery was last up 1 percent at $111.45
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after reaching
$111.90. Prices climbed as a fire burned at  Libya ’s Sarir field,
bolstering concern unrest in North Africa and the Middle East
will further reduce supply.  Silver climbed 1.4 percent to $40.20 an ounce, the highest
level since Feb. 11, 1980, in London. Gold rose 0.8 percent to
$1,469.29 an ounce after touching an all-time high of $1,473.07.  Tin for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange
was last up 1.4 percent at the day’s high of $33,000 a ton. Lead
climbed as high as $2,870 a ton and aluminum touched $2,714 a
ton.  Cotton for May delivery was last up 1.6 percent at $2.1145
a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Soybeans for May
delivery rose 1.2 percent to $13.8025 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade and May-delivery corn advanced 1.1 percent to
$7.67 a bushel.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
