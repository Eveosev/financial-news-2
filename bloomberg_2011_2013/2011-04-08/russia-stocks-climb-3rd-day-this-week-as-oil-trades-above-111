Russian stocks rose for the third
day this week as oil, the country’s main export earner, climbed
above $111 a barrel and gold advanced to an all-time high.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rallied 0.6 percent to 1,855.97 by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, giving it a weekly gain of 0.7 percent.
OAO Transneft, the oil pipeline operator, jumped 3.8 percent.
OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest lender, and OAO Gazprom, the
natural-gas export monopoly, both added 2.3 percent. OAO
Polymetal, a gold and silver producer, added 2.6 percent. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index increased 1.6 percent to 2,123.56.  Crude rose as much as $1.60 to $111.90 a barrel, the
highest intraday price since Sept. 22, 2008, after a fire at
 Libya ’s Sarir field bolstered concern supplies will be cut
further. Gold climbed as much as 1.2 percent to a record to
$1,471.88 an ounce. Copper, lead and nickel gained in  London .  “It’s pretty clear that this is going to be a long-running
game,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital, wrote in
an e-mailed report today. “Supplies from Libya are unlikely to
emerge at any point soon.”  Equity funds dedicated to Russia received $402 million from
investors in the week ended April 7, according to EPFR Global
data cited by UralSib Financial Corp. Russian funds attracted
$608 million in the previous week, EPFR said.  The rising oil price is “the main driver” for fund
inflows,  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib, wrote in an
e-mailed report.  “While oil price vulnerability remains high, we expect to
see investor interest broadening from oil plays into domestic
recovery and infrastructure themes,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
