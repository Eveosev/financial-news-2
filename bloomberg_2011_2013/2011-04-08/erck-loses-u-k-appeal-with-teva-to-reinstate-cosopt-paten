Merck & Co., the second-biggest U.S.
drug company, lost a U.K. court bid to reinstate its European
patent for the glaucoma treatment Cosopt after a successful
challenge by  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)   A November 2009 ruling that Merck’s patent lacked novelty
or inventiveness was correct because experts in the field would
have found the development to be obvious, the Court of Appeal
ruled today in  London .  “Merck is disappointed by the Court of Appeal decision,”
Ron Rogers, a spokesman for the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-
based company said today in a statement. “We are reviewing the
decision and considering our potential options.”  The U.K. unit of Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, the
world’s biggest maker of generic drugs, sued three years ago
over claims the patent shouldn’t have been granted after Merck
filed the application in 1992. The case was one of several
lawsuits between the companies in recent years over treatments
for  brain cancer , allergies and fungus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
