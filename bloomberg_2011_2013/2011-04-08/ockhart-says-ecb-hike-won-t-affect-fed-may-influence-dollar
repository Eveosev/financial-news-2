President  Dennis Lockhart  said the  European Central Bank ’s
decision to raise interest rates yesterday won’t influence his
view of U.S. central bank policy.  “I don’t see that a move by the ECB has any particular
influence on our policy posture here in the United States,”
Lockhart told reporters after a speech in Knoxville, Tennessee.
“Obviously by increasing the differential between short-term
rates in the U.S. and short-term rates in the euro zone, you can
see some influence” because “exchange markets are affected by
short-term rates. I think some of the dollar selloff reflects
some extent of that.”  The European Central Bank yesterday lifted interest rates
for the first time in almost three years to curb inflation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
