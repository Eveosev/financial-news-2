Taiwan ’s energy demand rose for a
fourth straight month in February as industrial companies
boosted electricity use amid the economic recovery.  Consumption of coal, petroleum, gas, thermal energy and
electricity climbed 3.7 percent from a year earlier to the
equivalent of 9.17 million kiloliters of oil, or about 2.06
million barrels a day, according to an e-mailed report from the
 Bureau of Energy  in Taipei today.  Taiwan’s industrial production increased for an 18th
consecutive month in February, an economic ministry report
showed on March 23. The economy expanded 10.82 percent in 2010,
one of the world’s highest rates based on International Monetary
Fund estimates. The government said in February it forecasts
growth of 4.92 percent this year.  Power consumption rose 5.4 percent to 16.8 billion
kilowatt-hours in February, the energy bureau said. Use by
industrial and energy companies, which accounted for 54 percent
of the demand, climbed 9.2 percent.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest
contract chipmaker, reported last month sales increased 8.8
percent from a year earlier in February.  Petroleum Products  Consumption of petroleum products declined 2.4 percent to
the equivalent of 4.05 million kiloliters of oil in February,
according to the energy bureau.  The combined utilization rate at crude oil distillation
units operated by  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  and  CPC Corp. ,
Taiwan’s two refiners, rose to 74 percent from 70 percent in
January, the energy bureau said. The units separate crude into
oil products and form the main part of a refinery.  Coal imports increased 14 percent to 5.11 million metric
tons, while imports of liquefied natural gas climbed 30 percent
to 950 million cubic meters, or about 720,000 tons, the energy
bureau report showed.  LNG is natural gas that’s been chilled to liquid form,
reducing it to one-six-hundredth of its original volume for
transportation by ship to destinations not connected by
pipeline. On arrival, it’s turned back into gas for distribution
to  power plants , factories and households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
