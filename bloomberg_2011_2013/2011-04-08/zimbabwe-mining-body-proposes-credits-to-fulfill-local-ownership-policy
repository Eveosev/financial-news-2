Zimbabwe’s mining industry proposed
a combination of equity and credits for social investments as
ways to fulfill the nation’s indigenization policy, which
requires all foreign-owned mines to come under at least 51
percent local ownership, the country’s Chamber of Mines said.  “The chamber’s own proposals to government had been for a
minimum indigenization quota of 26 percent equity, with the
balance of 25 percent made up of credits arising from corporate
social investments, support to the small-scale mining sector,
local procurement, skills development, release of ground and
establishment of new businesses,” it said in a statement
published in the Harare-based Independent newspaper today.  While the chamber supports and accepts the concept, ‘‘it
should be done in a way that will achieve the twin paramount
objectives of growth and development of the industry and the
Zimbabwe economy and broad-based economic empowerment.’’   To contact the reporter on this story:
