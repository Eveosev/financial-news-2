U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  will today rule out offering a bilateral loan to
Portugal as part of the rescue deal for the country, the London-
based Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The U.K. will still face liabilities of up to 4.5 billion
pounds ($7.34 billion) because of its participation in a
European Union emergency facility and as a shareholder in the
International Monetary Fund, the newspaper said. Osborne was to
fly to Budapest last night to attend EU meetings on the Portugal
rescue, the Times said, adding that  John Lipsky , the IMFâ€™s first
deputy manager director, will be present at the meeting.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
