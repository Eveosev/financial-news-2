Vietnam  Development Bank, a state-
owned lender that provides funding for government projects,
plans to extend as much as 35 trillion dong ($1.67 billion) of
loans to exporters at a reduced interest rate as part of the
government’s effort to cut the trade deficit.  That compares with about 20 trillion dong to 25 trillion
dong of loans the lender disbursed last year to exporters,
according to Nguyen Minh Tho, head of planning and capital
mobilization at the Hanoi-based bank.  The interest rate will be 11.4 percent, Tho said, citing a
Ministry of Finance instruction. Commercial banks charge
exporters 14.5 percent in interest, according to the  State Bank
of Vietnam ’s website.  Vietnam’s trade deficit widened to $1.15 billion in March
from $1.11 billion in February even after the government
devalued the nation’s currency the most since at least 1993. The
ruling Communist Party’s 14-member Politburo, the nation’s top
decision maker, told the government in a March 17 statement to
“take every chance to boost exports.”  Overseas shipments climbed 26 percent last year to $71.63
billion, according to the Hanoi-based General Statistic Office.
That’s equivalent to about 75 percent of an economy that
expanded 6.8 percent last year, the highest pace since 2007.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editor: Virginia Van Natta  To contact the reporter on this story:
