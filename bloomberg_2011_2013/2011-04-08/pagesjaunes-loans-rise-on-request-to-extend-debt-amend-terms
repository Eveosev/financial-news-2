Loan prices of  PagesJaunes Groupe (PAJ)  SA
increased after the French directories publisher said it asked
lenders to extend debt maturities and amend borrowing conditions
to give it flexibility to refinance this year.  PagesJaunesâ€™s term loans maturing in 2013 rose 1 percentage
point to a mid-price of 97.5 percent of face value, according to
prices from Mizuho Financial Group UFJ Ltd.  The company, which is controlled by KKR & Co., is offering
fees and an increase in interest margins to lenders who agree to
the new terms, which include extending the maturity of its
borrowings to 2015, it  said  yesterday.  PagesJaunes agreed to pay initial interest of 150 basis
points more than the euro interbank offered rate in 2006 when it
signed 1.95 billion euros ($2.8 billion) of seven-year term
loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
