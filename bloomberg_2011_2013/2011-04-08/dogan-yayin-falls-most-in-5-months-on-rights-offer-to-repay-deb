Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL) ,  Turkey ’s
biggest media group, fell the most in more than five months
after saying it will double its capital to 2 billion liras ($1.3
billion) by offering a rights issue to help pay back debt.  Dogan Yayin fell as much as 16 kurus, or 7.8 percent, to
1.88 liras, the biggest drop since Oct. 21. The stock traded 6.4
percent lower at 1.91 lira at 1:26 p.m. in Istanbul.  The company is contesting tax demands after its newspapers
reported links between between a fraud case involving an Islamic
charity in  Germany  and Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s
governing party. Erdogan denied the links and says the tax
authority is independent of political influence. The company
will offer shares at 1 lira each to help close or repay part of
its bank loans and debt to the government under a restructuring
plan, Dogan Yayin said in a statement today.  “If you’re a shareholder and you have to pay more cash
into the company for tax payments, yes, it’s not very good news
for investors,” Hasan Sener, an Istanbul-based analyst at Oyak
Securities, said by phone today. The payments will help make
bank payments and tax fines, he said.  Dogan Yayin reported its loss for the year through December
2010 narrowed to 237 million liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
