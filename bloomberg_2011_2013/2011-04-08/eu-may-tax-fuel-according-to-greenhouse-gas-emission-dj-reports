The European Commission plans to
propose a tax on transport and heating fuels for the first time
according to their energy content and greenhouse gas emissions,
Dow Jones reported, citing, a draft document obtained by the
news service.  The proposal, to be presented next week, would set a
minimum rate of 20 euros ($29) per metric ton of CO2 emissions
on products including gasoline, diesel, natural gas and coal as
of 2013, the news service said.  The minimum tax on diesel may also be gradually increased
to the same level as for gasoline by 2018, the news service
