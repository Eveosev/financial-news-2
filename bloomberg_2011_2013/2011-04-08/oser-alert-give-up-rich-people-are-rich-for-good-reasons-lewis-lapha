The Horatio Alger myth that poor
boys with determination, courage and hard work can make it big
is still part of conventional wisdom. In fact, your lifetime
income largely depends on factors over which you have no
control.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Where you are born determines more than 60 percent of
variability in global incomes, since you get a location premium
if your native country happens to be rich.  It also helps to have parents who are rich -- an additional
20 percent depends on your birth family’s income class.  So, the remaining 20 percent is hard work? Not so fast.
There are other factors over which you have no control, for
example gender, race and luck. Your own effort turns out to be a
surprisingly small component of your lifetime income.  I spoke with Branko Milanovic, author of “ The Haves and
the Have-Nots : A Brief and Idiosyncratic History of Global
Inequality,” on the following topics:  1. Rich Romans  2. Good and Bad Inequality  3. The Have-Mores  4. Birth Premium  5. Where Marx Went Wrong  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
