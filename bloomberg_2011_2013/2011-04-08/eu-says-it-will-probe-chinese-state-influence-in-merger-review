The European Union’s top antitrust
regulator said reviews of takeovers by state-owned Chinese
companies may examine how far the government influences business
decisions.  “We try to determine whether the companies manage their
business strategy independently, whether the decision-making
power lies with the controlling entity above them, at central or
regional level, and to what extent they effectively compete with
other public companies,” EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in the text of a speech in  St. Gallen ,  Switzerland ,
today.  European regulators have approved a $2 billion purchase of
silicon businesses from  Orkla ASA (ORK) ’s Elkem unit by chemicals
maker China National BlueStar Co. and China Huaneng Group, the
nation’s state-owned electricity producer, $1.23 billion bid for
a 50 percent stake in Massachusetts-based power utility
InterGen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
