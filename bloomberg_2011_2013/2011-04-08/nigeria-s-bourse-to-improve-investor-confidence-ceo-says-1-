The new head of the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange , sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest bourse, plans to
build confidence in the market in order to attract international
investors.  “We have to take market confidence seriously for us to
reach out to the rest of the world,” Oscar Onyema, chief
executive officer, told reporters in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial
capital and the home of the exchange.  Onyema replaced Emmanuel Ikazoboh who was appointed in
August as interim administrator after the Securities and
Exchange Commission removed former head  Ndi Okereke-Onyiuke , as
part of measures to address “inadequate oversight of the
exchange,” it said.  The exchange’s All Share Index rose for a second day,
gaining 0.6 percent to 24,897.92 by the 2:30 p.m. close, its
highest value since March 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
