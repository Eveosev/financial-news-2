Foreign investors buying Brazilian
domestic debt prefer short-term notes maturing in as many as
three years, a trend the country´s  Finance Ministry  is trying to
curb to stem capital inflows.  Foreign investors held 180.7 billion reais ($113.5 billion)
of public debt securities in February, 65 percent of which were
notes with a duration of three years or less, according to a
presentation published on the Treasury´s  website .  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  is attempting to restrict
short-term capital inflows to  Brazil  to restrain the
appreciation of the real. Foreign investment in the country
reached $33.5 billion from January to March, up from $25.5
billion in all of last year, according to central bank figures.  The proportion of short-term debt held by four other
categories of investors, including local governments, mutual and
pension funds and insurance companies, was less than for foreign
investors. Financial institutions also prefer short-term
securities, making up 70 percent of their holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
