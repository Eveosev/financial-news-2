HTC Corp. (2498) , the world’s largest maker
of handsets using Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. operating
systems, fell the most in a month in Taipei trading as it is
“overbought,” said Wei-Hang Chen, an analyst at President
Capital Management Corp.  The stock dropped 3.3 percent to NT$1,160 as of 12:18 p.m.,
set for the biggest decline since March 15. The shares had
gained 33 percent this year as of yesterday’s close, driving the
relative strength index to 70.6. The RSI measures how rapidly
prices have advanced or declined during the specified time
period. Some analysts see a reading of more than 70 as a signal
to sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
