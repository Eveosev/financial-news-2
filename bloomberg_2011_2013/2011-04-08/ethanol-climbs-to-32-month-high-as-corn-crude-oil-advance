Ethanol futures in  Chicago  climbed
to a 32-month high as corn, crude oil and gasoline advanced on
supply concerns and a weaker dollar.  The biofuel followed the other commodities higher on
speculation that  Libya ’s unrest will curtail crude oil supply
and on signs that the highest corn prices in two years haven’t
quelled demand for feed and ethanol. The dollar weakened against
its major counterparts as U.S. lawmakers failed to agree on a
federal budget.  “All the commodities are going nuts here,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest in Chicago. “This budget battle has
everyone fleeing to commodities.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 3.2 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.726 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since July 11, 2008. Prices have risen 15 percent
this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.775 a gallon and on the West Coast the fuel lost
3.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.825, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  gained 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.76
a gallon while the fuel declined 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.68 in Chicago.  Corn for May delivery jumped 9 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$7.68 a bushel in Chicago. Prices for the grain, the main input
in U.S.-made ethanol, have more than doubled in the past year.  Crude oil for May delivery rose $2.49 to $112.79 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since Sept. 22, 2008. Futures advanced 4.5 percent this week and
are 32 percent higher than a year ago.  Gasoline for May delivery added 7.42 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to settle at $3.2607 a gallon on the exchange, the highest
settlement for the contract closest to expiration since July 16,
2008. It covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The dollar slipped as much as 1.2 percent to $1.4477. A
weaker U.S. currency reduces the appeal of commodities, which
are priced in dollars.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are earning 11 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are profiting 15 cents
on a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
