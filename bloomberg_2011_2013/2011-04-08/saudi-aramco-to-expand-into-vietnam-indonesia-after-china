Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest
oil exporting company, is planning to expand into Vietnam and
Indonesia, adding to its business in Asia.  “As we speak we are busy developing new joint ventures or
expanding existing investments with NOCs like Sinopec and CNPC,
PetroVietnam and Pertamina,” Aramco Chief Executive Officer
Khalid Al-Falih said, according to a text of a speech posted on
the company’s website yesterday.  Saudi Aramco last month announced two ventures with Chinese
national oil companies, or NOCs. Sinopec agreed to take a 37.5
percent stake in Aramco’s planned 400,000-barrel-a-day fuel-
processing plant at Yanbu, on the kingdom’s Red Sea coast. With
 China  National Petroleum Corp., the Saudi producer committed to
building a 200,000-barrel-a-day refinery in southern China’s
Yunnan province.  While the Dhahran, Saudi Arabia-based company is building
more relations with national companies, it will continue to work
with multinational businesses such as Total, Dow Chemical,
Sumitomo Chemical and Shell, Al-Falih said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
