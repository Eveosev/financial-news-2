India ’s 11-year bonds headed for a
weekly gain on speculation demand for the notes will rise as
lower money-market rates signal an increase in cash availability
at banks, the biggest buyers.  The overnight borrowing rate between banks fell to 5.95
percent from 8.75 percent on March 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Lenders have boosted their holdings of
government debt by 474 billion rupees ($10.8 billion) this year
through March 11, the latest central bank data show.  “The  bond market  has a positive bias this week because
liquidity in the banking system has improved considerably,”
said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at Development
Credit Bank in Mumbai. “Demand from banks is expected to remain
healthy in the coming weeks.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022
dropped four basis points this week to 8.05 percent as of 10:46
a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.
The rate was little changed today.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
climbed eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, this week
to 7.47 percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
