Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , a German chemicals
maker, began construction on 1.1 billion-euro ($1.6 billion)
solar polysilicon plant in  Tennessee .  The plant in Cleveland, Tennessee will have an annual
output capacity of 15,000 metric tons and is expected to be
complete in late 2013, Munich-based Wacker said today in a
statement.  Almost all of the output of the plant has been
contractually secured for 2014. Wacker manufactured more than
30,000 metric tons of polysilicon in 2010 and is also expanding
its Nuenchritz and Burghausen plants in Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
