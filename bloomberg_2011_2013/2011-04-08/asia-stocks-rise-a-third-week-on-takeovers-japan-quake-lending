Asian stocks gained for a third week
as takeovers and the improving  U.S. economy  bolstered optimism
that the global recovery can be sustained. Stocks also rose as
 Japan  pledged support for businesses hit by the March 11
earthquake and made progress stabilizing a nuclear power plant.  Samsung Engineering Co., the South Korean builder of
petrochemical plants and industrial facilities, climbed 9
percent in  Seoul  on speculation it will benefit from rebuilding
efforts in Japan.  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN)  surged 30 percent in
Sydney after Minmetals Resources Ltd. made an unsolicited offer
of about C$6.3 billion ($6.5 billion) for the owner of Africa’s
largest copper mine. Yue Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Ltd., the
maker of shoes for Nike Inc. that gets 29 percent of sales from
the U.S., climbed 4.5 percent.  “We’re seeing more positive data coming out of the U.S.,”
said  Daphne Roth , head of Asian equity research at ABN Amro
Private Banking, which oversees about $14 billion in the region.
“Merger-and-acquisition activities are a positive sign,
underscoring the companies’ need to expand and grow their
businesses.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.9 percent to 136.54
as of this week, driving the regional benchmark index to its
highest level since last month’s earthquake. The gauge has risen
for the past three weeks as the U.S. unemployment rate dropped
to a two-year low and companies from Hitachi Ltd. and Toyota
Motor Corp. said factories in Japan that were shut after the
nation’s strongest earthquake on record will reopen this month.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 2.5 percent this week,
while  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index increased 2.1 percent.
Taiwan’s Taiex Index rose 2.2 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
Index gained 1.6 percent.  Japan Aftershock  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.6 percent since
April 1 amid speculation damage was limited from a 7.1 magnitude
aftershock that struck Japan on the night of April 7. Earlier
that day, the  Bank of Japan  unveiled the earthquake lending
facility, while voicing concern the destruction caused by the
March 11 temblor may depress economic growth in the coming
months.  The Nikkei 225 on March 14 and March 15 posted its biggest
two-day plunge since the 1987 stock-market crash after the quake
and tsunami on March 11 left more than 27,000 people dead or
missing and caused radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant. Through yesterday, the
benchmark  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  has fallen 6.4 percent since March 10.  Tokyo Electric  Tokyo Electric, which soared 24 percent yesterday, declined
6.5 percent through the week to 420 yen. The stock has plunged
80 percent since the earthquake.  “Investors are looking at a scenario that there will be
reconstruction opportunities in Japan, but I think the issues
will be more far-reaching,” said  Pauline Dan , Hong Kong-based
chief investment officer at Samsung Asset Management, which
oversees about $72 billion. “Aside from the risk of nuclear
fallout from Japan, we are still faced with a much higher
inflationary situation because of higher demand for fuel and
food.”  Samsung Engineering jumped 9 percent to 231,000 won in
Seoul. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the South Korean
shipbuilder that also supplies industrial machinery and
construction equipment, climbed 5.2 percent to 547,000 won.
Fanuc Ltd., Japan’s largest industrial robot maker, gained 4
percent to 12,840 yen.  Fast Retailing Co., the operator of the Uniqlo casual-
clothing chain, surged 12 percent to 11,940 yen. The retailer
raised its full-year net income forecast by 18 percent to 60
billion yen ($703 million) on overseas growth and lower costs.
Also, the company said it will form a venture with Mitsubishi
Corp. to operate Uniqlo clothing stores in Thailand.  Australian M&As  Equinox jumped 30 percent to A$7.44. Minmetals Resources,
the Hong Kong unit of China’s No. 1 metals trader, on April 4
offered C$7 a share for Equinox, 23 percent more than the Perth-
based company’s closing price in Toronto on April 1. The
Australian government had no objection to the deal, Minmetals
said yesterday.  Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX) , which abandoned its $8.8 billion
bid for  ASX Ltd. (ASX)  after the deal was rejected by Australian
Treasurer Wayne Swan, jumped 6.6 percent to S$8.38. ASX dropped
3.1 percent to A$33.33. The offer made by SGX, as the  Singapore 
bourse operator was known, on Oct. 25 represented a 42 premium,
a record for the industry.  “SGX was de-rated when it announced the deal as
shareholders didn’t really like that they were offering a very a
high premium,” said Anand Pathmakanthan, an analyst at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in Singapore. “It is only logical that with the
deal called off, the share price should re-rate.”  U.S. Unemployment  Exporters advanced after a government report showed the U.S.
unemployment rate dropped to a two-year low of 8.8 percent in
March from 8.9 percent in February.  Applications for jobless
benefits fell 10,000 in the week ended April 2 to 382,000, the
fewest since Feb. 26, U.S. Labor Department figures released on
April 7 showed.  Yue Yuen, the world’s biggest contract manufacturer of
athletic shoes, gained 4.5 percent to HK$26.65 in Hong Kong.  Li
& Fung Ltd. (494) , the biggest supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the
supplier of toys and home furnishings that counts the U.S. as
its biggest market, increased 1.4 percent to HK$40.50 in Hong
Kong.  Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) , the world’s largest
contract maker of mobile phones, climbed 3.5 percent to HK$4.72.
 HTC Corp. (2498) , a Taiwanese handset maker that gets about half of
sales from the Americas, rose 1.8 percent to NT$1,160.  Energy Producers Rally  “There is further evidence of the U.S. economy laying the
platform for a self-sustaining recovery,” said  Tim Schroeders ,
a Melbourne-based money manager at Pengana Capital Ltd., which
holds about $1 billion, including Japanese equities. “It
appears there is increasing willingness to look through nearer-
term issues such as the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, the
Libyan conflict and European debt issues.”  Energy producers gained after oil climbed above $110 a
barrel as a fire burned at Libya’s Sarir field, heightening
concern that spreading conflict in North Africa and the Middle
East will disrupt supplies.  Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil and gas producer,
rose 1.2 percent to HK$20.75 in Hong Kong.  Santos Ltd. (STO) ,
Australia’s No. 3 energy company, increased 2.1 percent to
A$16.28.  SK Holdings Co., the parent of oil refiner SK Innovation
Co., advanced 4.7 to 178,000 won. Samsung Securities Co. raised
its share-price forecast by 23 percent to 273,000 won, saying
the stock is “excessively” undervalued.  To contact the reporters on this story:
