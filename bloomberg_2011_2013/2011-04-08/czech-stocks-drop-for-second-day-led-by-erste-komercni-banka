Czech stocks fell for a second day
after Citigroup Inc. cut its recommendation on the country’s
equities to “underweight.”  The PX index of 15 companies dropped 0.1 percent to 1,270.9
at its 4:25 p.m. close in  Prague , paring this week’s gain to 1.1
percent. The benchmark gauge, which rallied 2.7 percent in the
first quarter, is valued at 12 times reported earnings, compared
with 9.9 times profit for the MSCI EM Eastern Europe Index.  “Equity market valuations have rerated on the continued
strength of the market in the first quarter, which is now
looking on the expensive side versus emerging-market peers,”
Citigroup wrote in a report.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  slid 1.1 percent to 880 koruna and
 Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of Societe Generale SA,
retreated 0.2 percent to 4,390 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
