Ukraineâ€™s government aims to open
three new coal mines with annual production capacity of 10.2
million metric tons to help increase output.  The mines will be located in the eastern Luhansk and
Donetsk regions and the Lviv region in the west, the government
said today in a statement on its  website . It gave no schedule
for starting production.  The government also plans to complete the first stage of a
new mine in the northwestern Volynska region next year,
according to the statement. The mine will produce 450,000 tons
of coal a year after the first stage is finished, it shows.  Government-managed mines in the country should aim to
produce between 100 million and 105 million tons of coal a year,
President  Viktor Yanukovych  said Feb. 25.  Ukrainian coal mines managed by the Coal and Energy
Ministry increased production by 829,000 tons to 9.39 million
