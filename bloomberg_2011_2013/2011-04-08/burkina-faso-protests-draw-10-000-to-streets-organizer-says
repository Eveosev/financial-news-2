More than 10,000 people
demonstrated today around  Burkina Faso  against rising prices
and corruption, said Tole Sagnon, one of the protest’s
organizers.  “We are demonstrating throughout the nation to say that
the country is badly governed,” Sagnon said in a telephone
interview. “We say that the people are hungry.”  Prices rose in the West African nation after the four-
month political crisis in neighboring  Ivory Coast  interrupted
the flow of imports. Burkina Faso doesn’t report a monthly
inflation rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
