U.K. Parliament Treasury Committee
Chairman  Andrew Tyrie  said it may be too late to break up the
merger between  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and HBOS Plc, the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview with Tyrie.  While the committee sees the need for increased competition
in the industry, it is “sensitive” to arguments that the
breakup of the group could be costly, Tyrie said, according to
the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
