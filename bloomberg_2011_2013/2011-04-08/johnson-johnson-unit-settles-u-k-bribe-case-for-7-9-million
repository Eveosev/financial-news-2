Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s DePuy
International Ltd. unit agreed to pay 4.8 million pounds ($7.9
million) to end a U.K. probe into allegations it paid bribes to
Greek officials to win contracts to supply orthopedic products.  DePuy “unlawfully obtained” 14.8 million pounds from
sales of orthopedic products to the Greek public health system
over eight years, the  Serious Fraud Office , which prosecuted the
case, said in a statement today. The company paid bribes of as
much as 20 percent of the value of the contracts, the SFO said.  The agency opened the probe in 2007 when it was referred by
the U.S. Department of Justice. Johnson & Johnson also agreed
today to pay $70 million to the U.S. to settle claims it bribed
doctors in  Europe  and paid kickbacks in Iraq to sell products
and win contracts.  “We are deeply disappointed by the unacceptable conduct
that led to these violations,” William C. Weldon, J&J’s
chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement on the
U.S. settlement.  A  London  court approved the deal with DePuy today. SFO
Director Richard Alderman said the settlement “served both the
interests of justice and the company’s desire to put illegal
activity behind it.”  A former marketing director at DePuy, Robert Dougall, last
year admitted his role in paying 4.5 million pounds in bribes to
Greek doctors. He was sentenced to a year in prison after
agreeing to cooperate with the SFO and  Justice Department . His
sentence was overturned in May by an appeals court.  To contact the reporter for this story:
