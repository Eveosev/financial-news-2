Best Buy Co., the largest consumer
electronics retailer, is temporarily restricting sales of some
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPad 2 tablets as it confronts supply shortages and
prepares for an undisclosed promotion.  While the retailer is still receiving iPad 2 devices from
Apple, it’s holding onto “non-reserved” inventory of the
device, Paula Baldwin, a spokeswoman for Best Buy, said in an e-
mailed statement. She didn’t detail the planned promotion.  “This is a customary practice for us when there are supply
constraints,” she said. “Best Buy enjoys a great partnership
with Apple.”  Since going on sale last month, the iPad 2 has sold out at
retail outlets, including Best Buy and Apple’s own stores. The
new model is slimmer and lighter and has front and rear cameras.
Apple has sold more than 15 million iPads since the device was
introduced last year. Sales data for the newest version of the
tablet computer haven’t been released by Apple.  Apple may continue to struggle with supply shortfalls after
the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  last month made it harder
for component makers to crank out needed parts. Production of
iPads and iPhones may be “meaningfully impaired” as a result
of the disasters, Pacific Crest Securities Inc. said last month.  Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based
Apple, declined to comment.  Best Buy, based in Richfield,  Minnesota , was unchanged at
$29.99 at 12:54 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Apple slipped $1.35 to $336.73 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
