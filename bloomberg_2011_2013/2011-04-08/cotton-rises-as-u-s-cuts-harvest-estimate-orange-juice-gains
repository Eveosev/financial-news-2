Cotton rose, heading for the biggest
weekly advance in more than a month, after the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  cut its estimate of the domestic crop. Orange-
juice futures declined.  The cotton harvest that ended in December totaled 18.1
million bales, down from 18.32 million estimated in March, the
USDA said today in a report. Five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expected 18.16 million bales. Prices have more than doubled in
the past year, touching a record last month, as demand increased
in  China , the world’s largest user.  “Sentiment is still bullish,” said Chris Kramedjian, a
risk-management consultant at FC Stone LLC in Nashville.  Cotton for May delivery gained 1.78 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.10 a pound at 10:38 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
A close at that price would leave the commodity up 7.4 percent
for the week, the most since the five days ended March 4. Cotton
reached an all-time high of $2.197 on March 7.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery rose 0.5 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $1.657 a pound on ICE, heading for a second straight
gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
