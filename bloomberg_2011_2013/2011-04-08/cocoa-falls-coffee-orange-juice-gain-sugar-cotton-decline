Cocoa fell after the European Union
lifted restrictions on shipments from the  Ivory Coast , the
world’s largest producer. Coffee and orange juice gained, while
cotton and sugar retreated.  The EU lifted the sanctions after president-elect, Alassane Ouattara called for their removal in an attempt to revive the
nation’s conflict-devastated economy. Supplies from the Ivory
Coast had been disrupted since Ouattara ordered an export ban in
January to cut off funds to  Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to step
down after the Nov. 28 election.  “There is consensus now that the end is in sight,” said
Luis Rangel, a vice president at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey
City , New Jersey. “Its now a matter of sorting out the logistic
issues before exports begins.”  Cocoa futures for July delivery fell $17, or 0.6 percent,
