Chilean banks charge inexplicably
high rates for consumer loans while offering cheap financing for
companies, central bank President Jose  De Gregorio  told a
gathering of bankers today, according to a copy of his speech
published on the central bank website.  “I don’t have a convincing explanation, because it’s hard
to explain average rates on consumer credits in the region of 30
percent or more,” De Gregorio told the Chilean associating of
banks and financial institutions in Zapallar, Chile.  Chilean companies can borrow at lower rates than
counterparts in most emerging markets, at costs similar to those
in developed economies, De Gregorio said. Given that, it is hard
to understand why banks charge so much for lending to consumers,
he said.  The average interest rate Chilean banks charged for a
consumer loan due between six months and one year was 35.85
percent in March, according to central bank data. The average
rate on a similar loan to a company was 10.05 percent.  De Gregorio welcomed recent legislation permitting covered
bonds in  Chile . Covered bonds should start to replace current
forms of mortgage financing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
