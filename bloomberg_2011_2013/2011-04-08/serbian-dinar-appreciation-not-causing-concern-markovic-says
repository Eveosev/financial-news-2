The Serbian dinar’s rise of between
two percent and four percent is neither excessive nor a cause
for concern, central bank Deputy Governor Bojan Markovic said.  “The National Bank of Serbia is always watching what’s
going on in the market,” Markovic told reporters today while
attending an exporters’ conference. There is no concern as long
as supply and demand were balanced and not creating
“psychological expectations,” he said.  The Belgrade-based  Narodna Banka Srbije  raised  Europe ’s
highest main rate by a quarter-point to 12.5 percent yesterday
and “one of the reasons why we raised the rate is that
inflation, according to our estimates, is somewhat above our
forecasts,” he said.  February’s inflation rate was 12.6 percent and March data
will be released on April 12.  The dinar traded at 101.25 to the euro at 11:52 a.m. in
Belgrade, up from its yesterday’s close at 101.90. It gained
four percent since the end of 2010.  The appreciating dinar may jeopardize growth, exports and
job creation in a country which is expected to see 3 percent
economic growth this year, central bank Governor Dejan Soskic
said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
