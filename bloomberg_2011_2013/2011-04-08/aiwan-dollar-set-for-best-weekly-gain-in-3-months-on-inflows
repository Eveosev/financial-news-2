Taiwan ’s dollar had its biggest
weekly advance in three months as overseas investors poured
funds into the island’s stocks on optimism the government will
be able to keep inflation under control.  The  consumer price index  climbed 1.41 percent in March from
a year earlier, less than the 1.70 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, official data showed this week.
That is the lowest among Asia’s ten-largest economies, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Global funds bought $546 million
more local shares than they sold today, bringing net purchases
for the week to $1.7 billion, exchange data show.  “Foreign inflows supported the  Taiwan dollar  this week,”
said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at Societe
Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “The lower-than-expected inflation
number also helped the rally.”  The Taiwan dollar appreciated 1.1 percent this week to
NT$28.991 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local
time close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency climbed
0.2 percent today and touched NT$28.903, the strongest level
since Feb. 10. Financial markets were closed on the first two
days of the week for public holidays.  Government bonds  headed for their first weekly advance in
three. The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021, the
most-traded government security, fell one basis point from April
1 to 1.354 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market, the
island’s biggest exchange for debt. The rate was little changed
today. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
