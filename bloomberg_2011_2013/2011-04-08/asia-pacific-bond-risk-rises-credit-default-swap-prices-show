The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
bonds from non-payment increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index increased 2.5 basis points to
137.5 basis points as of 9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. Contracts insuring Japanese government debt
against a default rose 1.5 basis points to 88 as of 9:30 a.m. in
Tokyo, Citigroup prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1 basis point to 104
as of 10:28 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.
The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade borrowers
outside Japan advanced 1 basis point to 104.5 as of 8:28 a.m. in
 Singapore , according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
