Copper futures headed for the
biggest weekly gain since early December on optimism that global
growth will sustain demand for industrial metals.  German exports rebounded in February as a strengthening
world recovery boosted demand, the Federal Statistics Office
said. Fewer Americans filed claims for  unemployment insurance 
than forecast, a government report showed this week. Copper
dropped 3.1 percent last quarter on concern the pace of economic
expansion would slow.  “The market’s shrugged off the fears and taken off
again,” said Andrew Silver, a trader at Natixis Commodity
Markets Ltd. in  London .  Copper futures for May delivery gained 7.1 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $4.4875 a pound at 10:59 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. A close at that level would leave the metal up 5.4 percent
this week, the most since the week ended Dec. 3.  “Commodities are skyrocketing based on the weaker
dollar,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, a senior strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “Buyers are coming back” amid
concern that the  Federal Reserve  will trail other central banks
in raising  interest rates , he said.  The dollar dropped to the lowest since December 2009
against a six-currency basket, boosting the appeal of
commodities as a hedge against inflation. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials rose to the
highest since September 2008.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery climbed $185, or 1.9 percent, to $9,855 a metric ton
($4.47 a pound).  Also in London, tin gained $350, or 1.1 percent, to $32,900
a ton after reaching an all-time high of $33,000. Aluminum
climbed $23, or 0.9 percent, to $2,695 a ton after reaching
$2,714, the highest since Sept. 1, 2008. Lead, zinc and nickel
rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
