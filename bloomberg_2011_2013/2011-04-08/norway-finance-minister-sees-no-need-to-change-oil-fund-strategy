Norway’s oil fund shouldn’t change
its investment strategy even if this has resulted in a lower
than expected return over the past 14 years, Finance Minister
Sigbjoern Johnsen wrote in Dagens Naeringsliv today.  Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, which invests the
country’s oil wealth abroad to avoid stoking inflation, targets
a return of 4 percent. Since its inception, the fund’s return
has averaged 3.3 percent, according to Johnsen. A fiscal
guideline limits the government’s annual expenditure to 4
percent of the fund.  "As I see it, the return over the past 14 years doesn’t
justify a change in the fiscal guideline or the investment
strategy of the fund," Johnsen said.  The  Finance Ministry , which sets the guidelines for the
world’s second largest sovereign-wealth fund, will present a
white paper on the fund later today.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
