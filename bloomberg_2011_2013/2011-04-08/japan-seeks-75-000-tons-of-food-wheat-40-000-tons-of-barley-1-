Japan  is seeking to buy 75,000
metric tons of food wheat and 40,000 tons of food barley through
a tender system introduced to loosen government grain-import
controls, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries.  The shipments must be made by July 31, Masafumi Otsuka at
the ministryâ€™s grain-trade division said today by phone in
 Tokyo .  The tender will be held under the so-called simultaneous
buy-and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
