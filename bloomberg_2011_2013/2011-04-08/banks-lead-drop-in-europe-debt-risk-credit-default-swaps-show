Banks led a decline in the cost of
insuring European bonds, according to traders of credit-default
swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on 25 banks and
insurers declined 6.5 basis points to 121, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. at 3:30 p.m. in  London , and the subordinated index
dropped 9 basis points to 206. Swaps on  Portugal  declined 15
basis points to 540, according to CMA.  The cost of insuring corporate bonds also fell. The Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings declined 5 basis points to 358. The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings
dropped 2.5 basis points to 94.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
