Yuan deposits in  Hong Kong  may rise
to 870 billion yuan ($133 billion) by the end of this year,
Zhang Guangping, deputy director general of the China Banking
Regulatory Commission’s Shanghai branch, said today.  Savings denominated in the currency climbed 10 percent to
407.7 billion yuan as of the end of February from the previous
month, according to data from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
the central bank. The total last year was 314.9 billion yuan.  China should continue to liberalize  interest rates  in the
process of encouraging the international use of the yuan, Zhang
said at The Asian Banker Summit in Hong Kong.  “Without liberalizing interest rates, it’s difficult to
price the currency,” Zhang said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
