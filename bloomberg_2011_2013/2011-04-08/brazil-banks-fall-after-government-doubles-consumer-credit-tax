Brazilian banks fell after the
government doubled a tax on consumer loans to curb lending
growth and fight the fastest inflation in more than two years.  Santander Brasil fell 2.3 percent to 18.92 reais at 11:29
a.m. in  Sao Paulo  (10:29 a.m.  New York ), as Bradesco dropped 2.2
percent to 32.41 reais. Itau Unibanco Holding SA lost 2 percent
to 37.69 reais. The benchmark Bovespa stock index was 0.8
percent lower at 68633 points.  “We like Brazilian banks, but not in the short term,” Bank
of America analysts led by Jorg Friedemann wrote in a note to
clients. “New macroprudential measures should not be
disregarded, as our economists still expect inflation to peak
only by August 2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
