Japan ’s government will distribute
76.2 billion yen ($894 million) in tax grants to prefectures
affected by last month’s earthquake,  Kyodo News  reported,
without citing where it obtained the information.  Internal Affairs Minister Yoshihiro Katayama announced the
distribution earlier today at a Cabinet meeting, Kyodo said.
While such grants are typically handed out in March and December,
the central government will provide local authorities the money
on a rolling basis, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
