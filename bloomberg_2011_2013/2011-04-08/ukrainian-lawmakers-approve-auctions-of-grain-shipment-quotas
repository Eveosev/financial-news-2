Ukrainian lawmakers approved the
sale of grain-export quotas at auctions following the
government’s decision to extend shipment limits to the end of
the marketing year on June 30.  Lawmakers endorsed a bill containing the provision late
yesterday, according to a posting on Parliament’s  website .
President  Viktor Yanukovych  needs to approve the legislation
before it comes into effect.  “The sum which grain exporters will pay for a quota will
simply be subtracted from” payments to farmers, Eugene Leng,
the head of  Ukrzernoprom Agro , the Ukrainian unit of Vienna-
based MCB Agricole Holding, said today in an e-mail. “The new
regulation is counter-productive.”  Ukraine imposed export quotas in October in an attempt to
control domestic food and fodder prices after drought damaged
harvests in Russia and Ukraine. The total limit of 6.2 million
metric tons is in force through June 30, the end of the
marketing year.  Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov ’s Cabinet will set procedures
for the auctions, the Kiev-based legislature said. Proceeds from
the quota sales will be used “for state support of the
 agriculture sector ,” according to the text of the bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
