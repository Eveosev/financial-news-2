Natural gas fell, posting its second
straight weekly decline, as forecasts for mild weather in the
eastern U.S. signaled tepid heating and cooling demand.  Gas futures slipped for a sixth day as forecasters
including  Commodity Weather Group LLC  predicted warmer-than-
normal weather in the Ohio Valley and Northeast next week.
Temperatures may be about 5 degrees above normal in  New England ,
according to the Bethesda, Maryland-based company.  “Daytime highs are going to be in the 60s in New York,
which is not exactly fertile territory for heating or cooling
demand,” said  Mike Fitzpatrick , a partner with the Kilduff
Group, a New York energy consulting company. “We’re just
grinding lower.”  Natural gas for May delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $4.041 per million British thermal units
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after dropping as low as
$4.014. The futures declined 7.4 percent this week and the six-
day slide is the longest losing streak since the end of August.  Prices may drop to the March 7 low of $3.731 per million
Btu next week, Fitzpatrick said.  The high temperature in New York on April 14 may be 68
degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius), 8 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.
The high in Cleveland may be 59 degrees, 2 above normal.  Mild Weather  Cooling demand may be 19 percent below normal in the U.S.
from April 14 through April 18,  David Salmon , a meteorologist
with Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri, said in a note to
clients today. Heater use in the Northeast may be 14 percent
below normal.  U.S. households consume about 20 percent of the nation’s
gas supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Power plants 
account for 30 percent.  Gas inventories totaled 1.579 trillion cubic feet as of
April 1, 0.6 percent above the five-year average, the Energy
Department said yesterday.  “The potential that supply will continue to surprise to
the upside for the reasons we have identified could lead to
upward revisions in end-of-season storage peak forecasts,” said
 Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank AG in
 Washington , in a note to clients today.  Natural gas rigs fell by two to 889 this week, according to
data published by Baker Hughes Inc. The decline was the first in
three weeks.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
326,423 as of 2:58 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 320,000. Volume was a record 546,752 yesterday. Open interest
was 934,174 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
899,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
