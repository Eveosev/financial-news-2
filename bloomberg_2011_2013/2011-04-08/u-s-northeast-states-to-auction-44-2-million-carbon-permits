A cap-and-trade program for  power
plants  in the Northeast U.S. will auction 44.2 million carbon-
dioxide permits on June 8.  The minimum allowable bid will be $1.89 a permit, unchanged
from the previous auction on March 9, the  Regional Greenhouse
Gas Initiative  said today in a  statement  on its website.  Each permit, also called an allowance, gives a power plant
the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide. The 10 states in
the cap-and-trade program, which spans  Maryland  to Maine, plan
to reduce the number of allowances they issue over time to cut
 carbon emissions .  The states may change the way they set the minimum
allowable bid in auctions and are seeking public comment by May
2, the regional cap-and-trade program said in an e-mail today.
The new method would set the minimum bid at 80 percent of the
“current market price.”  A consultant’s report released today by the trading program
recommends the market price should be calculated using data from
past auction sales and recent futures trading.  Permits for December delivery were unchanged yesterday at
$1.93 each on the  Chicago Climate Futures Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
