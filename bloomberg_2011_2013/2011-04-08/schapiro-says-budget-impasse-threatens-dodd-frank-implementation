A congressional impasse over federal
spending for the current fiscal year will hamper the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s efforts to implement Dodd-Frank Act
rules governing areas including hedge-fund registration and
derivatives, Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said.  “We’re stretched incredibly thin,” Schapiro said today in
remarks at the Society of American Business Editors and Writers
conference in  Dallas . “We can get the rules written, but what
we’re not going to be able to do is operationalize them.”  Funding for the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, which got expanded authority under the regulatory
overhaul enacted last year, has been caught in a congressional
battle between Republicans aiming to slash spending and
Democrats looking to pay for new oversight.  House Republicans 
are pushing to roll back federal spending to 2008 levels.  The SEC is one of the few financial regulators that would
be shut down if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a short-
term spending measure by tonight. Unlike the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the  Federal Reserve , which are funded
through industry assessments, the SEC relies on congressional
appropriations for its budget.  “Tomorrow, unlike almost every other financial regulator,
we may be shut down,” Schapiro said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
