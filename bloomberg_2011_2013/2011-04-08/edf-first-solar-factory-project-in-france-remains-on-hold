A plan by  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and  EDF
Energies Nouvelles SA (EEN)  for construction of a 120-megawatt solar
panel factory in Blanquefort, France, will remain on hold until
government tenders for solar projects are unveiled.  The project “will depend on what the French government
decides to do for the tenders for ground based solar projects,”
EDF Energies Nouvelles Chairman Paris Mouratoglou said during a
conference call today.  “Depending on what they decide, maybe the factory will be
built, maybe not,” he said. Terms of the tenders could be
published in the coming months, he added.  France suspended solar-energy projects for three months in
December after a boom in installations that Prime Minister
Francois Fillon called a “veritable speculative bubble.” The
government has since announced an overhaul that cut regulated
rates paid for the power by 20 percent and capped annual
installed capacity. Tenders will be held for solar projects with
a capacity greater than 100 kilowatts.  Electricite de  France  SA today announced it has made an
offer to buy the 50 percent it doesn’t already own of EDF
Energies Nouvelles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
