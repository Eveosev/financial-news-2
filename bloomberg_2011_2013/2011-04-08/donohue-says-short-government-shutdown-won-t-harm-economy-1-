U.S. Chamber of Commerce  President
 Thomas Donohue  said a brief federal government shutdown wouldn’t
undercut the U.S. economy.  Donohue said a greater risk to the economy will be if
Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, and the group, the
largest business lobbying group in Washington, would press
lawmakers to act. Donohue, who faulted President Barack Obama
during the first two years of his administration, said that the
burdens of office are changing him.  “We appreciate some of the things the president has done
to change his song,” Donohue said today in Washington at a
breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. “I think
what we’re having is a maturing of the president. I think he is
accommodating himself to the most challenging job in the
world.”  Donohue said Republican lawmakers would eventually support
any deal House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican, makes
with Obama and Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada
Democrat, on budgeting to avert or end a government shutdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
