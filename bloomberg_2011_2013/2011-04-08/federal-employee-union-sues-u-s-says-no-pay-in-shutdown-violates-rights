The American Federation of
Government Employees, a union that represents 600,000 federal
civilian workers, sued the U.S., claiming they can’t be forced
to work without pay if the government shuts down.  The union asked a federal judge in  Washington  today to
order the U.S. to pay civilian employees deemed “essential,”
who would continue working during a shutdown. Requiring them to
work without pay would violate their rights under the U.S.
Constitution, the union’s complaint alleges.  “People have a right to be paid in this country if they
have to come to work,” David Borer, the union’s general
counsel, said in an interview. So-called essential employees who
refuse to work face discipline, the complaint said.  Unless Congress and the White House reach an agreement on
the federal budget for fiscal year 2011, the federal government
at midnight would begin shutting down for the first time since
1995. About 800,000 “non-essential” federal employees would be
furloughed. Those deemed essential would be required to keep
working.  Charles Miller , a spokesman for the  Justice Department ,
said the agency is reviewing the lawsuit and will make a
determination as to how to respond.  The case is American Federation of Government Employees v.
U.S., 11-cv-00697, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
