Turkish industrial production fell
1.7 percent in February from a month earlier, according data
published by the government statistics agency in Ankara on its
website today.  Output rose 14 percent from February 2010 when adjusted for
the number of working days, the statistics agency said. Without
adjustment, the annual figure gained 13.9 percent, compared with
a median forecast of 14.5 percent in a Bloomberg survey of seven
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
