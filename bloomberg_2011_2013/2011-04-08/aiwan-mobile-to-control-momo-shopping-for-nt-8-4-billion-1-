Taiwan Mobile Co. plans to pay
NT$8.4 billion ($290 million) for control of Fubon Multimedia
Technology Co., the owner of Momo electronic shopping and
department stores, to boost revenue from non-voice businesses.  Taiwan Mobile will buy 51 percent of the Taipei-based owner
of the Momo brand shopping website, TV channels and stores from
Fubon Financial Holding Co., Josephine Juan, a spokeswoman at
the Taiwanese wireless carrier, said by phone today. The
purchase of existing shares was approved by Taiwan Mobile’s
board and requires regulatory approval, the company said in a
statement.  Taiwan’s second-largest mobile-phone operator is looking to
tap television and the Internet to secure revenue growth as the
telecommunications market slows. The Taipei-based carrier may
also pursue an acquisition of cable TV operator Kbro Co. after
Taiwan’s legislature approves changes to media ownership laws.  Fubon Financial will cut its holdings in Fubon Multimedia
Technology to 15 percent, with other stake buyers including
China Chemical & Pharmaceutical Co., Juan said.  Fubon Financial is a major shareholder of Taiwan Mobile.
Fubon’s chairman, Daniel Tsai, is vice chairman of the operator.
Daniel, his brother Richard Tsai and Fubon president Victor Kung
jointly own Fubon Multimedia Co., a holding company that owns a
major stake in Kbro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
