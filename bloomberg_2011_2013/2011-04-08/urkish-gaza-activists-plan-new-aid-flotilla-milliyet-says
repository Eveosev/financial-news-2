The Turkish group that helped
organize the aid convoy for Gaza last year on which nine Turkish
activists were killed plans a new flotilla in June, Milliyet
newspaper reported.  The convoy will set sail in the middle of June and will
include vessels from many countries, Bulent Yildirim, head of
the Humanitarian Aid Foundation, said in the Mediterranean
tourist city of Antalya, according to Milliyet.  Yildirim also called on the government to bar Israeli
tourists from Turkish resorts until their government apologizes
for the killings of the Turkish activists, Milliyet said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
