Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s
largest private-equity firm, agreed to buy a west  London 
business park from  Schroders Plc (SDR)  for 480 million pounds ($787
million).  The Chiswick Park site has planning consent for more than
1.8 million square feet (167,000 square meters) of offices,
retail space and health clubs, according to a statement posted
yesterday on London-based  Savills Plc (SVS) ’s website. So far, 1.25
million square feet of accommodation has been developed and an
additional 550,000 square feet is scheduled for construction.  Chiswick Park lettings represented more than one third of
the office deals in the western part of the area lying within
the M25 ring road around greater London, said Jeremy Bates,
national head of office agency for Savills. Los Angeles-based  CB
Richard Ellis Group Inc. (CBG)  and Savills acted as joint brokers on
the sale.  The complex, which houses the headquarters of  Tullow Oil
Plc (TLW) , was put on the market in November after the unit trust that
holds the property expired in December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
