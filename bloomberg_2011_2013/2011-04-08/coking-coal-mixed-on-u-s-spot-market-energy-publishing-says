Metallurgical coal prices were mixed
this week on the U.S. spot market, Energy Publishing Inc. said.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal were unchanged
at $330 a ton in the week ended today, according to the
 Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider. High-volatility coal
rose $8.33, or 2.9 percent, to $298.33.  “Even as U.S. low-vol producers settled international
business for the April-June quarter at $330/metric tonne signs
developed that high-vol coal is beginning to get some serious
traction in the seaborne market,” Energy Publishing said today.  Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
