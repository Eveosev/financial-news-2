Rory McIlroy  leads  Angel Cabrera ,
 Charl Schwartzel  and  K.J. Choi  by one shot midway through the
final round at golf’s Masters Tournament, where  Tiger Woods  is
two strokes back.  McIlroy, 21, is 11-under par with nine holes to play at
Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. He’s 1 over
today.  Cabrera, the 2009 Masters winner, is 10-under along with
Choi and Schwartzel.  Woods, a four-time Masters champion, tied McIlroy for the
lead before the Northern Irishman birdied the seventh hole and
Woods missed a three-foot putt to bogey the par-3 12th hole.  Woods, who has never come from behind in the final round
during his 14 major victories, started the final round seven
shots behind McIlroy in a tie for ninth place.  McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, was four shots ahead of a
group of four players entering the day, the largest 54-hole lead
at the Masters since Woods’s record 12-stroke win in 1997.  Three players have blown a 54-hole lead of four or more
strokes at the Masters, most recently  Greg Norman , who lost a
six-shot advantage in 1996. Ed Sneed squandered a five-shot lead
in 1979 and  Ken Venturi  finished second in 1956 after carrying a
four-shot lead into the last day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
