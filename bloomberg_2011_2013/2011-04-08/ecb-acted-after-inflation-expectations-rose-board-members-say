European Central Bank Executive
Board members Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell and Jose Manuel Gonzalez- Paramo said the bank increased  interest rates  yesterday after
inflation expectations rose.  “It’s very important to monitor inflation expectations,
where we saw some signs of an increase recently,” Tumpel-
Gugerell told reporters at an event in Berlin today. “We’ve
seen a cost push and monetary policy has to act preemptively.
It’s important to avoid second-round effects now.”  Inflation expectations, as measured by the difference in
yields between five-year German nominal bonds and similar-
maturity index-linked debt, have tripled since August, reaching
2.3 percent on April 4. The ECB, which aims to keep inflation
just below 2 percent, yesterday raised its benchmark rate to
1.25 percent from a record low of 1 percent, the first increase
in almost three years.  Asked how concerned the ECB is about rising inflation
expectations, Gonzalez-Paramo said: “The move yesterday answers
the question.”  While indicators don’t show second-round effects have
emerged, “there are risks that they could materialize if we
don’t act,” he said. “ We want to avoid that, we’re paid to
avoid that second-round effects would materialize.”  Gonzalez-Paramo also said interest rates remain
“accommodative.”  “They’ve been accommodative for some years, it doesn’t
mean anything,” he said. “There is a point in the cycle where
rates should be accommodative. And if you look at rates now, at
the short end they remain very negative, which is
accommodative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
