European Central Bank Executive
Board member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said euro-area governments
must “follow up words with action” in their fiscal policies.  “The economic and monetary union is certainly also a
solidarity union,” Tumpel-Gugerell said in a speech in Berlin
today. At the same time, “solidarity is not a one-way street
from donor countries to recipient nations.”  Budget blowouts in nations such as Greece and Ireland
triggered a sovereign debt crisis in the euro region that’s led
to speculation about the currency’s future.  Portugal  this week
became the third euro-area nation to succumb to the crisis and
seek a European Union bailout. The ECB has been forced to take
unprecedented steps to stem the crisis, such as buying
 government bonds .  “Solidarity is a two-way obligation for support -- that
means member states are at first glance obliged to follow a
solid economic and fiscal policy,” Tumpel-Gugerell said.
“Every nation must keep its own house in order.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
