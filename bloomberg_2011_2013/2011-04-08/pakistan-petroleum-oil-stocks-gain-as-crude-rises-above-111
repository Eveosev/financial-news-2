Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. (PPL) , the
nation’s second-biggest fuel explorer, led gains among energy
stocks in Karachi trading as oil surged to a 30-month high.  Pakistan Petroleum rose 1.7 percent, its biggest rise in
more than two weeks, to 211.15 rupees at 9:48 a.m. local time.
Oil & Gas Development Co., Pakistan’s biggest fuel explorer,
gained 0.7 percent to 133.75 rupees.  Pakistan Oilfields Ltd. (POL) ,
the third-biggest fuel explorer, surged 2 percent to 328.99
Rupees.  Crude for May delivery rose as much as 89 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $111.19 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , as a fire burned at Libya’s Sarir
field and on concern the conflict in other energy-exporting
countries may spread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
