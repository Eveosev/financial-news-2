The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development agreed to invest $25 million in Ukrainian
wholesale pharmaceutical distributor Alba Ukraine to improve its
stock management and logistics and help it expand market share.  The loan of up to $13 million and an equity investment of
up to $12 million will assist the company to meet its target to
attain 20 percent of the Ukrainian pharmaceutical market by
2016, the London-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement.
The EBRD did not provide any terms of the investment.  The bank has invested $8.3 billion in 264 projects in
Ukraine and is the largest financial investor in the former
Soviet state, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
