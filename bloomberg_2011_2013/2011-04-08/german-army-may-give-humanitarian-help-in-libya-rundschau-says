Germany ’s army may participate in a
humanitarian aid mission in Libya,  Frankfurter Rundschau 
reported, citing unidentified government officials.  The assistance might mean that the 990 German soldiers who
are part of the European Union’s battle group may be deployed to
the North African country, the newspaper said.  German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said yesterday
that Germany won’t abandon its responsibilities if a request is
made by the United Nations to the European Union for assistance
in Libya, Rundschau reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
