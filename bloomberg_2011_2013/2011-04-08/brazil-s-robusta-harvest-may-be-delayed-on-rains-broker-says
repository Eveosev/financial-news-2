The robusta coffee harvest in
 Brazil , the world’s second-largest producer of the variety, may
only begin next month after rainfall in March, according to Rio
de Janeiro-based broker Flavour Coffee.  “The heavy rains during March and yet cloudy days may
delay the start of the harvesting for May,” the broker said in
a weekly report e-mailed yesterday.  Harvesting of the 2011-12 crop in the state of Espirito
Santo, Brazil’s main robusta-producing region, was expected to
commence in the second half of April, CEPEA, a University of Sao
Paulo research group, said last month.  The “general shape” of robusta trees is “nice,” with
“plenty of cherries,” Flavour Coffee said. Trees still need
“some weeks until maturation starts,” it said.  Vietnam  is the biggest robusta grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
