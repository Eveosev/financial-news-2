Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  has restarted a
hydrocracker at its Port Arthur refinery in  Texas ,  Bill Day , a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The unit was shut March 31 so workers could fix a
compressor seal leak, Day said last month.  The Port Arthur refinery has a capacity of 310,000 barrels
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
