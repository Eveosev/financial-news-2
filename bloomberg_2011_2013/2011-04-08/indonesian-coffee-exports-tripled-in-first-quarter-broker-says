Coffee exports from  Indonesia , the
world’s third-largest producer of robusta beans, tripled to
65,500 metric tons in the first quarter from a year earlier,
Hamburg-based broker  Eugen Atte GmbH  said in a weekly report e-
mailed yesterday.  Coffee sales from the country accelerated in response to
rising London prices, European brokers said last month. Robusta
prices climbed 15 percent on NYSE Liffe in London in the first
quarter, data on Bloomberg show.  Indonesia’s production will decline about 25 percent to 8.5
million bags in the current crop year, the  International Coffee
Organization  said April 6. The impact from the La Nina weather
phenomenon has been “more severe than expected,” the ICO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
