Corn stockpiles in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower, are plunging to a 15-year low and may be
smaller than the government forecast last month as rising demand
from makers of feed and ethanol drive prices higher.  Stockpiles on Sept. 1, before the harvest, will drop 66
percent from a year earlier to 589 million bushels, a Bloomberg
survey of 30 analysts showed. That’s 13 percent less than a
March 10 estimate by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture , which
will update its forecast today. Tightening supply led Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to raise its corn-price forecast last week.  About 40 percent of the crop is used to make ethanol as the
government subsidizes the fuel additive and retail gasoline
nears $4 a gallon. Corn futures have more than doubled in the
past year to the highest since July 2008, as rising pork and
beef prices encouraged demand from livestock producers and as
U.S. export-sales expanded at the fastest pace in three years.  “Ethanol demand is strong, and rising cattle prices have
been offsetting increased costs of feed,” said  Shawn McCambridge , the senior grain analyst for Prudential Bache
Commodities LLC. “At this point we haven’t seen a lot of
evidence that prices are having a negative impact on demand.”  Corn futures fell 4 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $7.59 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade yesterday, after touching
$7.7325, the highest since July 2008. Prices have risen 21
percent this year, outgaining soybeans and wheat. The most-
active futures reached a record $7.9925 on June 27, 2008.  Planting Increase  While the USDA said last week that farmers will boost
planting by 4.5 percent this year, sowing the second-most acres
since 1944, corn may need to top $9 before demand begins to slow
from ethanol producers, according to  Dan Basse , the president of
AgResource Co. in Chicago.  “The ethanol producer is still making money,” even with
high corn costs, Basse said April 6 at an industry conference in
Chicago. “This is a multiyear  bull market  in grain. It’s not
something that’s going to be alleviated in just a year.”  The amount of corn used to make ethanol may climb this year
to a record 4.95 billion bushels, compared with a harvest of
12.447 billion, the USDA said last month. Farmers probably will
plant 92.178 million acres (37.3 million hectares) this year, up
from 88.192 million in 2010, the USDA said.  During the past year, the grain rally helped fuel a 37
percent increase in global food prices tracked by the  United
Nations , touching a record in February. While prices fell almost
3 percent in March, the first decline in nine months, the UN’s
 Food and Agriculture Organization  said yesterday that costs may
rebound because demand continues to increase.  Food Inflation  Costlier food contributed to riots across northern  Africa 
and the Middle East that toppled leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia 
and is driving up inflation, spurring central banks to consider
higher  interest rates  that may slow growth. In the U.S., food
costs were 7.8 percent higher in the first quarter than a year
earlier, the  American Farm Bureau Federation  said April 5.  Goldman analysts Damien Courvalin and  Jeffrey Currie  said
corn would rise to $8.60 in three months, compared with a
previous forecast of $6.20, according to a report to clients
April 1. The bank also raised its six-month outlook to $7.80
from $6 and its 12-month estimate to $7 from $5.80. Goldman
advised consumers and investors to buy futures for December
delivery traded in Chicago.  Global corn inventories probably will fall to 120.3 million
metric tons, down 2.3 percent from last month’s USDA’s forecast,
according to the Bloomberg survey.  To rebuild corn stockpiles, “we need the combination of a
good crop and lower usage, and it’s going to be tough to get
both,” said  Christian Mayer , a market analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investments Co. in  Minneapolis .  Soybean Inventories  The USDA also may reduce its estimate of domestic soybean
inventories and raise its forecast for wheat, according to the
Bloomberg survey.  Soybean stockpiles on Sept. 1 may total 136 million
bushels, down from the USDA’s March estimate of 140 million and
less than the 151 million left at the end of the last crop year,
the survey showed. World stockpiles may total 58.42 million
tons, up from 58.33 million estimated last month and down from
59 million last year, analysts said.  Supplies are “not as dire as the corn situation, but
there’s not a lot of room for error there either, if we start to
export more than we projected,” said Frank Cholly Sr., a senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “We do have a
relatively tight supply, so we need to replenish.”  Yesterday, soybean futures for May delivery fell 13 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to settle at $13.635 a bushel on the CBOT. The
price has gained 43 percent in the past year on record U.S.
exports to  China .  Wheat Supply  U.S. wheat inventories as of June 1 may total 856 million
bushels, up from the USDA’s March estimate of 843 million,
according to the survey. Stockpiles still will be 12 percent
smaller than a year earlier, as demand has increased for U.S.
exports, after drought spurred  Russia  to ban shipments last
year.  World supplies may total 181.55 million tons, down from
181.9 million estimated in March and 197.32 million last year,
according to the survey.  Yesterday, wheat futures for May delivery dropped 9.25
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $8.09 a bushel in Chicago. The price
is up 66 percent in the past year.  The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter of corn, soybeans
and wheat. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7
billion in 2010, government figures show. Soybeans were second,
valued at $38.9 billion, and wheat ranked fourth at $13 billion,
behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
