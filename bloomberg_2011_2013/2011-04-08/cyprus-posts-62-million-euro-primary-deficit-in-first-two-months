Cyprus posted a primary deficit of
62 million euros ($89 million) in the first two months of 2011,
as  government spending  outstripped revenue, the  Ministry of
Finance  said.  Total government spending rose 15 percent from the year-
earlier period, to 1.17 billion euros, while total revenue fell
0.3 percent, to 952.6 million euros, the ministry said in a
 statement  on its website today.  Cyprus had a 9 million-euro primary surplus in the first
two months of 2010. The primary figure doesnâ€™t count interest
payments on debt.  The government plans to cut spending by 72.3 million euros.
The  finance ministry  forecasts a budget deficit of 4 percent of
gross domestic product this year, compared with an estimated 5.3
percent shortfall in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
