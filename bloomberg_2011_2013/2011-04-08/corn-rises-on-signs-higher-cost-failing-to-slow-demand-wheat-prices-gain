Corn rose for the first time in
three sessions on signs that the highest prices since 2008 have
failed to slow demand for ethanol and animal feed. Wheat gained
as adverse weather threatened U.S. crops.  U.S. corn reserves before the harvest will fall 60 percent
to 675 million bushels, unchanged from last month’s forecast and
the lowest since 1996, the Department Agriculture said today.
Futures have more than doubled in the past year, and yesterday
touched the highest since July 2008. Cattle prices reached a
record this week, and oil touched a 30-month high.  “Although the USDA left its U.S. corn inventory
projections unchanged, we reiterate our expectation for further
tightening in the 2010-2011 corn balance on continued strong
feed and ethanol demand,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts
Damien Courvalin and  Allison Nathan  said in a report today. The
analysts reiterated an April 1 forecast for corn to rise 12
percent in three months.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 9 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to close at $7.68 bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Most-active futures rose 4.3 percent this week, the
fourth straight weekly gain. The grain touched a 33-month high
of $7.7325 yesterday as global production trailed gains in
demand.  Wheat futures for July delivery rose 23.25 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $8.3225 a bushel in Chicago, the first gain in four
days. The contract jumped 4.6 percent this week. Most-active
futures climbed 72 percent in the past year as drought spurred
 Russia  to ban exports, while floods eroded crops in  Canada  and
 Australia .  Winter-Wheat Crop  The condition of the U.S. winter-wheat crop on April 3 was
worst in nine years as dry weather persists in the southern and
central Great Plains, the USDA said this week. About 34 percent
of the area that grows hard red winter wheat was in drought
conditions, according to T-Storm Weather LLC in Chicago.  U.S. winter-wheat yields are likely to be as much as 9.3
percent below average this year based on similar years when La
Nina weather conditions were weakening, as they are this year,
Mike Tannura, the president of T-Storm Weather, said today in a
note to clients. Yields in 1996 were the third lowest in 50
years, and in 1989 they were the sixth lowest, Tannura said.  Analysts were surprised that the USDA failed to reduce its
estimate of domestic corn reserves. A Bloomberg News survey
showed an expected cut to 589 million bushels, after the
government last week estimated that March 1 reserves fell 15
percent from a year earlier.  Corn Inventories  On March 1, corn inventories dropped to 6.523 billion
bushels as demand rose to a record in the December-to-February
quarter, the USDA said March 31. Supplies held by farmers fell
26 percent from a year earlier and represented 52 percent of
total U.S. stockpiles, the smallest for the date since before
1960, USDA data showed.  “Further reported declines in corn stocks are not
politically desirable as rising corn prices would undercut
public support for subsidizing ethanol, which is the core
element of the White House’s biofuels policy,” Don Carson, a
New York-based senior analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group
LLC, said in a report today. “Grain prices need to rise in
order to ration demand.”  Corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed, is the biggest
U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in 2010, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest, behind soybeans and hay, at
$13 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
