Tin jumped to a record, and copper
and zinc climbed to one-month highs on optimism global economic
growth will sustain demand for industrial metals. Lead advanced
to the highest level in three years and aluminum reached the
highest price since September 2008.  Three-month delivery tin on the  London  Metal Exchange rose
as much as 1.1 percent to $32,915 a metric ton. Copper gained as
much as 1.8 percent to $9,839.50 a ton, the highest price since
March 7, as the dollar slumped to the lowest since December 2009
against a six-currency basket.  “Investors are in a good mood and feeling positive about
the global economy,” said Li Peiying, an analyst at Essence
Futures Co. in Beijing. “It’s not just metals. Inflation
expectations and the weaker dollar are really helping the rally
in commodities today.”  The dollar dropped to the lowest since January 2010 versus
the euro after the European Central Bank yesterday boosted
borrowing costs for the first time in almost three years to
combat inflation. Gold surged to a record, while oil traded near
the highest level since September 2008.  Copper in London traded at $9,820 a ton at 3:06 p.m.
Singapore time, up 4.9 percent this week, the largest weekly
increase since Feb. 4, even as  China  this week raised  interest
rates  for the fourth time in less than six months. Fewer
Americans filed first-time claims for  unemployment insurance 
last week, adding to signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering.  ‘More Optimistic’  The “more optimistic tone” came after Rio Tinto Group,
the third-largest mining company, said “China demand is
expected to outpace supply, despite China’s government
increasing interest rates,” analysts led by Mark Pervan at
 Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. wrote in a note
today. ANZ yesterday raised its 2011 average copper forecast 0.9
percent to $4.51 a pound ($9,944 a ton). Copper averaged $7,558
a ton last year.  Rio Tinto joined Codelco and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. this week in saying that China’s copper demand will
continue to grow. A shortage this year may rise to between
400,000 tons and 500,000 tons,  Andrew Harding , head of  Rio
Tinto ’s copper business, said April 6.  Copper is Citigroup Inc.’s “most-favored” base metal, as
mine supply lags behind demand on lower ore grades and ore
depletion, the bank’s London-based analyst Jon Bergtheil said in
Singapore on April 5. Researcher Brook Hunt is predicting a
570,000-ton shortfall this year, while  Barclays Capital  expects
an 822,000-ton deficit.  Lead in London gained as much as 2.1 percent to $2,849.50 a
ton, the highest price since April 2008, and aluminum increased
as much as 0.9 percent to $2,697 a ton, the highest level since
September 2008. Zinc rose as much as 2 percent to $2,502 a ton,
the highest since March 4, and nickel climbed as much as 2.5
percent to $27,480 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
