Treasuries fell, headed for a third
weekly loss, after traders added to inflation bets and Federal
Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said the
central bank may begin unwinding its stimulus by year-end.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt, widened to 2.61
percentage points. It was the most in 32 months.  “The Fed speakers are making very hawkish comments,” said
Chungkeun Oh, a fixed-income trader in  Seoul  at Industrial Bank
of Korea,  South Korea ’s largest lender to small and medium-sized
companies. “People are thinking the Fed will hike rates. I’m
not sure if it will happen this year or next, but we have to
prepare for it. Yields are rising.”  Ten-year rates increased two basis points to 3.57 percent
as of 10:29 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 3.625 percent note maturing in February 2021
declined 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 15/32.  Policy makers last month differed over whether to begin
removing record stimulus this year as they debated the path of
monetary policy after the completion of their $600 billion bond-
purchase program, minutes released this week of the Fed’s March
15 meeting showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
