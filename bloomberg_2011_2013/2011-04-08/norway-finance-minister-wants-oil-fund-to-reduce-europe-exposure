Norway’s oil fund should reduce its
exposure to  Europe  and increase investments in developing
economies, Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen wrote in
Aftenposten today.     "The world’s production capacity and securities markets are
located to an increasing degree in other parts of the world,"
Johnsen said. "Over time it is natural that this is also
reflected in the fund’s investments."  The  Finance Ministry , which manages the world’s second-
largest sovereign wealth fund, will later today present a white
paper on the Government Pension Fund Global.   Johnsen told the Oslo-based paper in a separate interview
that the white paper will call for the introduction of a ceiling
on bonuses for external managers at the fund.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
