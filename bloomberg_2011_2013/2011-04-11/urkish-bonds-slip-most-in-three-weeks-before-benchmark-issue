Turkish bonds fell, raising yields
the most in almost three weeks as investors increased cash
holdings to buy new benchmark two-year bonds to be auctioned
tomorrow. Stocks gained and the lira retreated.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt climbed 14 basis points,
or 0.14 percentage point, to 8.82 percent at the 5 p.m. close in
Istanbul, its biggest advance since March 23.  The Treasury plans to borrow 7.1 billion liras ($4.7
billion) this month from three debt sales, it said March 31. It
sold 1.6 billion liras of bonds due January 2014 today and will
sell 10-year inflation-linked debt and two-year notes tomorrow.  “People sell bonds both for booking profits and entering
the auctions with better positions, and the yields are rising
fast because sales are not countered by buying,” Yasin Demir, a
trader at Is Investment Securities, said by telephone. “We do
not expect this to turn into a lasting trend and possibly see a
speedy recovery after the auctions.”  The lira depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.5143 per dollar,
snapping four days of increases.  Turkey ’s currency has rallied 4.6 percent versus the dollar
in the past month, the fourth-best performance of more than 20
emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg, benefiting from the so-
called carry trade, in which investors buy currencies of
countries with low rates and invest in assets of nations with
higher yields.  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  rose 0.2 percent to 68,194.72 at
the 5:30 p.m. close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
