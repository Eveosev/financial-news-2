Husky Energy Inc. (HSE) , the Canadian  oil
company  controlled by Hong Kong billionaire  Li Ka-Shing , said
its Lloydminster oil-sands upgrader in Saskatchewan resumed
normal operations after a Feb. 2 fire cut output.  The upgrader is operating at 75 percent to 85 percent of
capacity and moving toward full production, the Calgary-based
company said in a statement. The pretax cost of the incident is
estimated at C$80 million ($83.7 million) to C$90 million, Husky
said.  The fire damaged a hydrocracker fractionation unit that
supplies product to the coker at the facility, near the Alberta-
Saskatchewan border. Repairs were hampered by congested space
and extreme cold, Husky said. The upgrader, which can process up
to 82,000 barrels daily, operated at 40 percent to 50 percent of
normal rates during the repairs.  The fire started when a pipeline froze and burst, releasing
fuel onto equipment, Husky said. The cause has been analyzed and
repairs have been made incorporating measures to prevent a
similar incident in the future.  To contact the reporter on this story:
