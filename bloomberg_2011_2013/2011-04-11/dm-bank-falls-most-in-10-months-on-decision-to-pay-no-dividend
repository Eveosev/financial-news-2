MDM Bank fell the most in more than
10 months after the Russian lender’s board recommended no
dividend be paid for 2010, according to an e-mailed statement.  The bank’s preferred shares slumped as much as 23 percent
before closing 12 percent lower at 17.1 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in
Moscow, the biggest retreat since May 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
