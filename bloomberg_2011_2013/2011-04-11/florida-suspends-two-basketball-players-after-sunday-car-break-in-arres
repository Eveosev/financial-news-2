University of Florida  basketball
coach Billy Donovan suspended forwards Erik Murphy and Cody
Larson after the two players were arrested yesterday on a charge
of breaking into a car.  “I am aware of Cody and Erik’s situation and very
disappointed with the news,” Donovan said today in an e-mailed
statement. The coach added that the two were suspended from all
basketball-related activities and that he wouldn’t comment
further until he met with both students.  Murphy and Larson were arrested along with a third male
early yesterday in St. Augustine,  Florida , roughly 77 miles east
of the university in Gainesville, after witnesses saw them break
into a car, according to the arrest report from the  St.
Augustine  Police Department. The two were transported to St.
Johns County Jail and charged with breaking into a vehicle.  Murphy, a 20-year-old sophomore from South Kingstown, Rhode
Island, played in 33 games this season, averaging 4.3 points and
2.3 rebounds per game. Larson, a 19-year-old freshman from Sioux
Falls,  South Dakota , didn’t take the floor for the Gators this
season, according to statistics on the team’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
