Activists barricaded a road outside
the London offices of Electricite de France SA today to protest
plans by  Europe ’s biggest power producer to build a new
generation of U.K. nuclear power plants.  About ten demonstrators from the Boycott EDF group erected
two 14-foot (4-meter) high tripods on Grosvenor Place by
Victoria rail station at around 8:00 a.m. today and blocked cars
and road access in the city for around six hours.  Between the structures hung a banner marked “nuclear
disaster area.” The road was reopened at 2:05 p.m. and two
arrests were made, according to a Metropolitan Police spokesman,
who declined to be identified, citing force policy.  “EDF has spent a massive amount of money marketing as an
environment-friendly company,” said Bella Benson, a spokeswoman
for the activist group, in an e-mailed statement. “But the
truth is that it’s planning to lumber us with an outdated form
of energy that is incredibly dangerous, extremely expensive and
completely unnecessary.”  The Paris-based utility, which is the world’s largest
operator of nuclear reactors, said nuclear energy has a “vital
role” in maintaining the U.K.’s future electricity supply.  “That view is backed by the government and industry and a
large proportion of the public,” spokeswoman Phillippa Coates
said in an e-mailed statement.  Around 3,800 people gathered at EDF’s oldest nuclear plant
at Fessenheim,  France , yesterday to demand its shutdown, Le
Monde reported, citing police estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
