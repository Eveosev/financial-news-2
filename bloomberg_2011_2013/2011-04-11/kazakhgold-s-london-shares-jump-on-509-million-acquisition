KazakhGold Group Ltd. (KZG)  jumped in
 London  trading after saying Kazakhstan’s Assaubayev family will
buy its operating units in Kazakhstan, Romania and Kyrgyzstan
for $509 million, resolving a dispute that’s prevented a merger
with parent OAO Polyus Gold.  The stock gained 6.4 percent to $2.5 by 12 p.m. in London,
erasing a 6 percent loss on April 8.  Polyus,  Russia ’s largest gold miner, bought KazakhGold from
the Assaubayevs in 2009. It agreed last December to sell
KazakhGold’s mines and reserves back to the family as it sought
to end a dispute over the value of the assets and pursue a
merger with its London-listed KazakhGold unit. That accord broke
down in March when Polyus said the Assaubayevs hadn’t raised
sufficient funds. The family said at the time it was still
pursuing the acquisition.  Polyus dropped 0.7 percent to 1,710 rubles by 2:29 p.m. in
Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
