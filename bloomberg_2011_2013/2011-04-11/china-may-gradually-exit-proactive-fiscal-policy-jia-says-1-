China  is likely to exit proactive
fiscal policy gradually,  said Jia Kang, head of the Ministry of
Finance’s research institute.  Jia denied a report by Xinhua News Agency earlier today
that cited him as saying at a conference that China may shift
fiscal policy to “prudent” from “proactive” at year-end.  “The most likely outcome is a gradual exit” because
proactive fiscal policy won’t be China’s normal practice, Jia
said, adding that there is no timeframe for the shift.  China has eased off stimulus measures that shielded the
nation from the global financial crisis by raising  interest
rates  and officially shifting to a tighter, “prudent” monetary
policy this year.  The nation’s description of its fiscal policy as
“proactive” started when the Cabinet announced a package of
emergency measures to protect growth in November 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
