Chile’s peso fell after reaching a
six-week high as copper dropped for the first time in five
sessions, signaling a lower  trade surplus  for the world’s
biggest producer of the metal.  The peso weakened 0.4 percent to 472.01 per  U.S. dollar 
from 469.91 on April 8. The currency rallied 1.3 percent last
week.  Copper futures for May delivery dropped 0.8 percent to
$4.466 a pound at 12:45 p.m. New York time after the industrial
metal gained 5.8 percent in the previous four sessions. Copper
accounts for more than half of Chile’s exports by value.  “The peso is moving in line with global equity futures and
the price of copper, which is slightly down today,” said Matias  Madrid , an economist at Banco Penta.  European stocks fell from a one-month high, led by
carmakers and construction companies, after another earthquake
struck  Japan . The MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost 0.5 percent.  Chile ’s central bank will raise its benchmark interest rate
by a half point tomorrow to 4.5 percent, according to 17 of 20
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The remaining three estimate a
quarter-point increase.  The central bank bought $50 million at an average of 470.44
pesos per dollar today. The bank has been buying $50 million a
day since Jan. 5 as part of a plan to weaken the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
