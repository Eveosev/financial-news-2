Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
ordered the government to “take urgent measures” to create and
maintain a natural-gas exchange.  Medvedev gave Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his deputy
 Igor Sechin  until June 1 to carry out the order, the Kremlin’s
press service said today in an e-mailed statement.  Mezhregiongaz, a unit of the natural gas export monopoly,
OAO Gazprom, ran an electronic trading platform for Russian
producers to trade natural gas tied to physical deliveries from
2006 to 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
