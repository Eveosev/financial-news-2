U.K. stocks were little changed,
with the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  trading near a seven-week
high, as gains by bank shares offset a slide at  WPP Plc. (WPP)   Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  rose
after a banking commission recommended changes that failed to
inflict as much damage to lenders’ earnings as some investors
had speculated.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  rallied 1.8 percent amid
speculation that the company will buy Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s
stake in Woodside Petroleum Ltd. WPP sank 1.9 percent as UBS AG
added the shares to its list of least preferred stocks.  The FTSE 100 fell less than 0.1 percent to 6,053.44 at the
4:30 p.m. close in  London . The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  slid 0.1
percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index declined 0.9 percent.  “Relative to expectations, the universal banks such as RBS
and Barclays fare the best from the report,” Joseph Dickerson,
a London-based analyst at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento
SA, wrote in an e-mail to clients today. “The Independent
Commission on Banking’s report seems in-line with what has been
leaked to the press and discussed in the general market.”  The FTSE 100 has rallied 8.1 percent from this year’s low
on March 16 as investors speculated that the global economic
recovery will withstand  Japan ’s worst earthquake on record and
popular revolts in the Middle East and north Africa. The gauge
has soared 72 percent, or 88 percent including reinvested
dividends, since its March 2009 low as the global economy
recovered from recession and corporate profits beat estimates.  RBS, Barclays  RBS jumped 2.3 percent to 44.4 pence. Barclays rallied 2.8
percent to 305.4 pence. The FTSE 350 Banks Index climbed to its
highest level in a month.  BHP Billiton  gained 1.8 percent to 2,631.5 pence. The
world’s largest mining company denied that it plans to buy
Shell’s stake in Woodside Petroleum in a A$46 billion ($48.5
billion) takeover. BHP “is not aware of any basis for the
market speculation” or media reports linking it to Woodside,
the company said in a statement. The Sunday Times reported
yesterday that BHP has held talks with Shell.  HMV Plc surged 4.4 percent to 11.8 pence. The U.K. retailer
of books, music and DVDs postponed a rights offer because of
shareholder hostility to the plan, the Observer reported, citing
advisers to the company and unidentified investors.  WPP sank 1.9 percent to 746.5 pence as UBS said it is more
negative on media agencies than publishers or broadcasters.  888 Holdings Plc (888)  slid 5.4 percent to 43.5 pence after the
U.K.-listed Internet gambling company that may be bought by
Ladbrokes Plc said Chief Executive Officer Gigi Levy will step
down “to pursue other interests.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
