Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO) ,  Greece ’s biggest phone company, has begun an
internal investigation on allegations that between 2003 and 2006
individuals connected to the company received improper payments
from U.S.-based  Comverse Technology Inc. (CMVT)   Hellenic Telecom “will take all necessary actions in order
to safeguard the interests of the group,” the Athens-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today. “Management has
immediately instructed the relevant departments of the group to
fully investigate the issue.”  Comverse agreed to pay $2.8 million in settlements with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Justice
Department on April 7 for violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act. The violations arose from $536,000 in improper
payments to individuals connected to Hellenic Telecom, the U.S.
Justice Department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
