Ecobank Transnational Incorporated,
a bank with a presence in 32 African countries, entered into an
alliance with Bank of  China  to boost the flow of funds and trade
between the Asian nation and Africa.  Ecobank opened a China desk in  Accra , Ghana, Arnold Ekpe,
the group’s chief executive officer, said at a conference today.
The desk will be managed by two employees of Ecobank and two
senior staff from Bank of China.  “The desk will facilitate loans to Chinese and African
businesses, corporations and development projects in Africa,”
he said.  Bilateral trade between Africa and China grew 43 percent in
2010 from a year earlier, Samuel Ashitey Adjei, managing
director of Ecobank Ghana Ltd. said. Trade between Ghana and the
Asian nation increased to $2.05 billion in 2010 from $1.3
billion the year before, he said.  Ecobank, which is listed in Ghana, Nigeria and on West
Africa’s regional bourse, has an alliance with  Nedbank Group
Ltd. (NED)  of  South Africa . Ghana last year signed $13 billion of loan
agreements with Chinese investors. The West African nation will
start using $2.85 billion of the loans for road projects this
year, Roads and Highways Minister Joe Gidisu said Nov. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
