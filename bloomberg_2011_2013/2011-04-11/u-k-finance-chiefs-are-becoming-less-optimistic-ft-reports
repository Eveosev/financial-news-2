The finance chiefs of Britain’s
biggest companies are at their least optimistic for two years,
because of austerity and accelerating inflation, though they
still see business expansion as the top priority in the next 12
months, according to a quarterly survey by Deloitte, the
Financial Times reported.  Four fifths of those questioned said they expect the
government’s fiscal squeeze to cut potential earnings, on
average by 7 percent, the newspaper said.  They were unsure about whether economic recovery can be
sustained and saw a 29 percent likelihood of a double-dip
recession, up from 27 percent in the previous survey, the FT
said.  Deloitte questioned 137 chief financial officers in March,
including those of 46 FTSE 100 companies and 46 FTSE 250
companies, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
