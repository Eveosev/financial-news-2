The Boston  Red Sox  defeated the New
York Yankees 4-0 as  Josh Beckett  and Jonathan Papelbon combined
on a two-hit shutout with 12 strikeouts.  The Red Sox won two of three games in the series between
the American League Eastern Division rivals after losing their
first six games of the Major League Baseball season.  Beckett pitched eight innings with 10 strikeouts at
Bostonâ€™s Fenway Park last night, while Papelbon worked a
scoreless ninth inning. CC Sabathia was the losing pitcher for
the Yankees, allowing one run over 5 2/3 innings.  Dustin Pedroia scored the first Boston run in the third
inning on an infield single by Mike Cameron. Marco Scutaro
extended the lead with a two-run double in the seventh inning
off Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain.  David Ortiz  added a run-scoring double in the eighth for
Boston, which improved to 2-7. The Yankees fell to 5-4 and are
one game behind first-place Baltimore in the AL East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
