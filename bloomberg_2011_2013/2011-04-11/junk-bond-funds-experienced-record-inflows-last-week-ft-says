Junk-bond funds had record inflows
last week as retail investorsâ€™ appetite for high-yield corporate
debt reasserted itself after a lull in March, the Financial
Times reported, citing EPFR, which tracks fund flows.  Globally, $1.47 billion was invested in high-yield funds
last week, the highest weekly figure ever; in the U.S., inflows
amounted to $933 million, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
