The  International Securities
Exchange , the third-largest U.S. options exchange last month,
began trading contracts today on a new technology platform
jointly developed with  Deutsche Boerse AG. (DB1)   The system, called Optimise, is designed for high-volume,
fast electronic trading. ISE, based in New York, had used a
system licensed from  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , which runs the
Nasdaq OMX PHLX exchange that was the second-biggest U.S.
options platform in March. ISE is owned by Eurex, whose parents
are Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse and Zurich-based SIX Swiss
Exchange AG.  “The new system achieves the ideal blend of speed,
capacity and rich functionality that are three critical
differentiators in the highly competitive U.S. options
industry,” Daniel Friel, ISE’s chief information officer, said
in a statement.  ISE handled 17 percent of U.S. equity derivatives volume in
March. The largest was the  Chicago Board Options Exchange  at 26
percent followed by PHLX at 22 percent. Deutsche Boerse has
agreed to purchase New York-based NYSE Euronext, which owns two
U.S. options markets: NYSE Amex, which handled 14 percent of
trading, and NYSE Arca, with 10 percent.  Ten options began trading on the system today, the ISE
 statement  said. All options will be moved over in stages by the
end of July.  “With the launch of Optimise at ISE, we have taken an
extremely important first step in establishing a new foundation
for the technology infrastructure at Deutsche Boerse,” Jurg
Spillman, Optimise program manager, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
