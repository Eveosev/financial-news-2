Latvia’s 2010 budget deficit
narrowed to 7.6 percent of economic output from 9.6 percent in
the previous year, the  statistics office  said.  The data may still be amended by Eurostat, the European
Union’s statistical arm, and additional information on the
deficit will be released on April 18, the Riga-based office said
on its website today.  The figure is “is almost one percentage point lower than
the limit set by the  International Monetary Fund  and the
European Commission’s aid program agreement,” said Dainis
Stikuts, a senior economist at Swedbank AB’s Latvian unit, in an
e-mail. “The basis for the good result is the economic recovery
which ensured better than planned tax revenue.”  Latvia’s gross domestic product grew an annual 3.6 percent
in the final quarter of 2010, the quickest pace of expansion in
three years, as exports and industrial production picked up. The
country turned to a group led by the IMF and European Commission
in 2008 for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.8 billion) loan after its
second-biggest bank needed a state rescue.  The deficit was partly lowered by the short-term effects of
reducing some government payments into future pension plans and
increasing dividend payments from state-owned companies, Stikuts
said.  “Reform has to continue to ensure a sustainable budget and
introduction of the euro,” he said.  The government expects to pass additional budget measures
in a supplementary budget on April 14 which will bring the
deficit down to 4.2 percent of GDP this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
