The ruble gained for a second day,
heading for its strongest close since December 2008, as oil
traded above $112 a barrel, boosting demand for Russian assets.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 27.9852 per
dollar by 11:11 a.m. in Moscow. A close at that level would be
its best since Dec. 18, 2008. Against the euro, the Russian
currency weakened 0.1 percent to 40.4600.  Crude,  Russia ’s main export earner, traded near a 30-month
high of more than $112 per barrel in  New York . Brent oil for May
settlement retreated 0.1 percent to $126.47 a barrel in  London 
from $126.65 on April 8, the highest level since Aug. 1, 2008.  Moves against the dollar and the euro left the ruble little
changed at 33.5989 against the central bank’s target currency
basket, which it uses to manage swings that hurt Russian
exporters. The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s
rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together.  -- Editors: John Kohut, Stephen Kirkland.  To contact the reporters on this story:
