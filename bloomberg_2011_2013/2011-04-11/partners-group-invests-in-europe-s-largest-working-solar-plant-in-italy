Partners Group Holding AG (PGHN) , a Swiss
money manager, invested in a 276 million-euro ($399 million)
solar photovoltaic plant in northern Italy.  The Zug-based private equity firm bought the 71-megawatt
facility in Rovigo with First Reserve Corp., according to a
 statement  today on its website. Partners Group declined to
disclose how much each company invested in the project.  SunEdison, a subsidiary of  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) ,
built the plant, according to the statement. It was connected to
the grid in November and is expected to produce enough power for
about 16,500 homes.  “We have long identified the rising need for
environmentally-friendly sources of energy and the potential
offered by investments in this segment,” Michael Barben, head
of private infrastructure, said in the statement.  The power is sold under the 2010 Italian feed-in-tariff.
It’s currently the biggest single operating solar power plant in
 Europe , the company said in the statement.  Partners Group has a “considerable” European and global
deal pipeline in clean energy projects, Barben said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
