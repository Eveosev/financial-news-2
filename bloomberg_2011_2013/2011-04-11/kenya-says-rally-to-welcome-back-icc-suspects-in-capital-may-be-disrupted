Kenya ’s government said a rally
planned in the capital, Nairobi, to welcome back suspects who
appeared before the  International Criminal Court  last week may
be disrupted.  The prayer meeting, organized by President Mwai Kibaki’s
Party of National Unity, will be held at Uhuru Park in the city
center this morning, government spokesman  Alfred Mutua  said in a
statement on a government website. Members of Prime Minister
Raila Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement plan to disrupt the
gathering “with an aim of causing confrontation and possible
violence,” he said.  “The strategy is to paint the returning Kenyans as
violent, with an aim of influencing the ongoing process at the
International Criminal Court,” Mutua said. Two calls to ODM
spokesman Salim Lone’s mobile phone this morning seeking comment
weren’t answered.  Six Kenyans including Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  and
suspended Higher Education Minister William Ruto appeared before
the ICC in The Hague last week for a hearing to decide whether
they should stand trial on accusations of crimes against
humanity during post-election violence three years ago.  The six men are accused of orchestrating two months of
clashes that left 1,500 people dead and displaced another
300,000. The ethnic clashes were triggered by a December 2007
presidential election that returned Kibaki to office, and which
his political rival Odinga said was rigged.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
