U.K. broadcasters have begun a
campaign against Internet companies and other organizations that
want the government to relax copyright laws, the Financial Times
reported, citing Adam Crozier,  ITV Plc (ITV) ’s chief executive
officer.  Crozier said Culture Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  and Business
Secretary Vince Cable were told at a recent meeting that
broadcasters and producers are opposed to the introduction of
so-called “fair use” principles, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
