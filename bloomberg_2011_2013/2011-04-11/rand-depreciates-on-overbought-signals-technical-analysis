The rand declined for the first day
in four after technical measures suggested the currency was
overbought against the dollar.  South Africa ’s currency lost as much as 0.4 percent to
6.6485 per dollar, and traded 0.2 percent weaker at 6.6512 as of
4:09 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The rand’s 14-day relative strength index closed at 72 on
April 8 and fell to 70 today, the level that suggests an asset
is likely to drop, according to technical analysis. The rand
climbed about 5 percent against the dollar from March 16 through
the end of last week.  “The momentum on the rand may be ready to shift,” Judy Padayachee, a technical analyst at  Absa Capital , said by phone
from Johannesburg. After more than three weeks of gains, “the
rand is overbought,” she said.  The South African currency may weaken to 7.20 per dollar,
Padayahchee said. The dollar will find strong support at 6.60,
she wrote in a research note. Support levels occur where buy
orders for a currency are clustered.  “We would first need to see overbought levels unwinding
before demand would return” for the rand, Padayachee said.  The rand has also reached overbought levels against the
euro, and may weaken to 10 per euro, she said. The rand traded
at 9.6088 per euro as of 3:45 p.m.  South African  government bonds  declined. The 13.5 percent
security maturing in 2015 lost 27 cents to 121.09 rand, driving
the yield 6 basis points higher to 7.76 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
