after the record quake that triggered a tsunami on March 11,
leaving 27,493 dead or missing and disabling Tokyo Electric’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  “After yesterday’s quake, investors are likely to wonder
whether there’s more to come,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “That’s
likely to weigh on sentiment.”  IMF Cuts Estimates  U.S. stocks and crude prices fell yesterday after the IMF
cut its estimate for growth in the U.S., the world’s biggest
economy and the largest oil consumer. In  New York , the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.3 percent to 1,324.46 yesterday

2.9 percent last year and less than a 3 percent growth rate for
2011 forecast in January, the IMF said. The Washington-based
fund also cut its estimate of Japan’s growth to 1.4 percent from
1.6 percent in the previous forecast after the nation’s
earthquake and tsunami.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.3 percent by the S&P

Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., the utility battling to cool
nuclear reactors crippled by the tsunami in Fukushima, is likely
to pay no year-end dividend for fiscal 2010 and skip payments
for the current fiscal year, the Nikkei newspaper reported today.  The  Bank of Japan  is scheduled to release minutes of the
March 14 meeting today at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo. The central bank
voted during that meeting to pump a record amount of cash into
the financial system and doubled the size of its asset-purchase
plan to shield the economy from the effects of the quake.  To contact the reporters on this story:
