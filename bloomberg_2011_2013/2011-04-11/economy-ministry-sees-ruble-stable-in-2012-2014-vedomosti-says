Russia’s ruble will be stable
against the U.S. dollar between 2012 and 2014, the country’s
Economy Ministry said in a forecast,  Vedomosti  reported.  The exchange rate may reach 28.4 rubles to the dollar by
the end of this year from the current 28.1, the newspaper said.  The average exchange rate is forecast to be 27.9 rubles per
dollar in 2012, 2013 and at 28 rubles in 2014; the forecast is
based on the assumption of a stable average exchange rate
between the dollar and the euro, which the ministry estimated
would be $1.40 dollar per euro in 2012-2014, Vedomosti reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
