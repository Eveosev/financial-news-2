House Republicans  plan to release a
bill tonight identifying which programs will be cut as part of a
budget deal reached last week that the chamber plans to vote on
April 13.  The plan, which averted a government shutdown, will cut
roughly an additional $8 billion in so-called discretionary
spending as well as $17.8 billion in mandatory programs, said
Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations
Committee. Budgets for discretionary programs are set each year
by Congress. Mandatory programs such as Medicare are open-ended,
with benefits paid to whoever meets program criteria.  The roughly $38 billion spending-cut deal announced by
lawmakers and President  Barack Obama  on April 8 included $12
billion in savings already approved as part of previous stopgap
funding measures.  House members said they are eager to learn which programs
are targeted for funding reductions.  “We don’t know yet what the cuts are,” Representative
 Chris Van Hollen , a Maryland Democrat, said yesterday on ABC’s
“This Week with Christiane Amanpour.” “They’re still sifting
through the areas where they’re going to make cuts.”  Hing declined to identify which programs will be trimmed.  The legislation will set funding levels for hundreds of
programs for the remainder of the fiscal year that ends Sept.
30. A stopgap measure currently keeps the government in business
through April 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
