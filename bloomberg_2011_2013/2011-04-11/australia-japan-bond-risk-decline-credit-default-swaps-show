The cost of protecting bonds from
non-payment in Australia and  Japan  decreased, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1 basis point to 131
basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG. The index is headed for its lowest since the series 15
of the index started trading on March 28, data provider CMA
prices show.  Contracts insuring Japanese government debt against default
were little changed at 86.5 as of 9:27 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche
Bank prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 1 basis point to
103 as of 10:18 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole CIB prices show.
The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade borrowers
outside Japan was unchanged at 104 as of 8:18 a.m. in  Singapore ,
according to Credit Agricole.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
