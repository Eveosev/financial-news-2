Taiwan ’s dollar climbed for a sixth
day, its longest winning streak in seven months, as speculation
the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain an accommodative monetary
policy spurred demand for higher-yielding assets.  Overseas funds bought $1.75 billion more of the island’s
stocks than they sold this month, exchange data show. Fed Vice
Chairman  Janet Yellen  said April 9 any improvements in the U.S.
economy don’t yet warrant an exit from “unconventional monetary
policy” and Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President  Sandra
Pianalto  said April 7 that the current policy should be
continued. The U.S. central bank buys government debt to keep
borrowing costs low, a policy known as quantitative easing.  Fed policy makers “want to continue with QE2, while other
countries are raising  interest rates ,” said  Henry Lin , a
Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong
Commercial Bank. “Inflows to Taiwan are very huge” and the
local currency may strengthen to NT$28.80 this week, he said.  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.35 percent to NT$28.89
against its U.S. counterpart as of 10:19 a.m. local time,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It earlier reached NT$28.874, the
strongest level since Feb. 10. The Taiwan currency is the best-
performing Asian currency this year, having advanced 5.1 percent.  The Fed said in November it would buy $600 billion of
Treasuries through June in a second round of quantitative easing,
building on $1.7 trillion of asset purchases made between
December 2008 and March 2010. It’s benchmark interest rate has
been kept at a maximum 0.25 percent since 2008, while Taiwan’s
was raised by half a percentage point to 1.75 percent in the
past year.  Taiwan’s government bonds declined, with the yield on the
1.375 percent note due March 2021 rising to 1.360 percent from
1.354 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market, the
island’s biggest exchange for bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
