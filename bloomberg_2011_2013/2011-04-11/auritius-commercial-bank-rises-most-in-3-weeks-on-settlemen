Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB)  rose to
its highest level in almost two months after saying it reached a
settlement with  Mauritius Union Assurance Co. (MUA)  over claims and
counterclaims lodged by the companies.  The stock of the Indian Ocean island nation’s largest
lender by market value advanced 4 rupees, or 2.3 percent, to 176
rupees at 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, the strongest increase
since March 22. The companies commented on the settlement in
statements on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s website
published after the market closed on April 8.  “The banking group will receive 250 million rupees ($8.9
million), which includes 100 million rupees worth of redeemable
preference shares of Mauritius Union Assurance,” Kishen
Nadassen, a senior research analyst at the Port Louis-based CIM
Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a phone interview. “The unexpected
recovery of the losses suffered by MCB as a result of the frauds
explains today’s interest in the stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
