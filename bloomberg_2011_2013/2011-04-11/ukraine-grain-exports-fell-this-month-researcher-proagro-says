Grain exports from Ukraine slumped
86 percent in the first six days of April, to 25,500 metric tons
from 180,170 tons in the same period a month earlier, ProAgro
said.  Corn accounted for 22,500 tons and wheat made up the rest
of the shipments, the Kiev-based research company said in e-
mailed statement today. It didnâ€™t give a reason for the decline
in exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
