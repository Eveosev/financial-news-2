U.S. stocks erased gains, after two
straight days of losses for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The  S&P 500  fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,327.77 at 12:17
p.m. in New York. The benchmark gauge had dropped 0.6 percent
over the last two trading days. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
rose 30.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,410.10 today. About
three stocks declined for every two that rose on U.S. exchanges.  The S&P 500 rose 5.6 percent in 2011 through April 8 amid
government stimulus measures and as corporate profits beat
analysts’ estimates for an eighth straight quarter. Earnings for
S&P 500 companies rose 12 percent in the first quarter and will
increase 17 percent this year, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
