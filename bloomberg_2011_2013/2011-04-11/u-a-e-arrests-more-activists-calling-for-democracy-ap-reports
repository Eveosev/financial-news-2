Two more activists have been
detained by police in the  United Arab Emirates  after they called
for democratic changes in the Persian Gulf state, the  Associated
Press  reported today, citing Mohammed al-Mansouri, a lawyer and
activist.  Nasser bin Ghaith, an economics professor at Abu Dhabiâ€™s
Sorbonne University, was arrested in Dubai yesterday, the AP
said. Fahad Saleh al-Shehhy was detained April 9 in the U.A.E.
emirate of Ajman, it said.  Calls and e-mails to the U.A.E. federal government were not
immediately returned.  The detentions follow the April 8 arrest of Ahmed Mansour,
who was taken from his home, according to his wife. Mansour was
among a group of activists and academics who signed an online
petition last month calling for changes that would allow members
of the Federal National Council, an advisory body to the U.A.E.
government, to be elected by the public and given full
legislative and regulatory powers.  Half of the members of the council are currently chosen by
a government committee and the rest are appointed by the rulers
of the seven emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
