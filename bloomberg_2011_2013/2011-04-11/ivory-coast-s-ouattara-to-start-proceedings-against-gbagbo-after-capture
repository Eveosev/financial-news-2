Ivory Coast President-elect
 Alassane Ouattara , plans to start judicial proceedings against
rival  Laurent Gbagbo , who was captured today after French and UN
forces laid siege to the presidential residence.  In a televised speech, Ouattara said Gbagbo and his wife
“will be treated with dignity and their rights will be
respected.” A truth and reconciliation commission to
investigate human rights violations may be established, he said.  Ouattara’s Republican Forces are guarding Gbagbo and his
wife at the Golf Hotel, which Ouattara used as a base after the
disputed Nov. 28 elections. The capture may signal an end to the
violent four month impasse that left Ouattara, the
internationally recognized winner of the election, unable to
take office.  Ouattara also called on pro-Gbagbo youth militias to lay
down weapons and urged Ivorians to refrain from vengeance.  “To the youth turned into militias, they must understand
that their struggle no longer has sense,” he said. “In these
historical moments for our country, I invite you to exercise
calm and restraint. I ask all my fellow citizens to do
everything so as peace resumes for good in our country.”  To contact the editor on this story:
