Brazilian equities are poised to
climb past record 2008 highs, said Pedro Bastos, regional head
of Latin America for HSBC Holdings Plc’s global asset management
division.  The Bovespa stock index will rally at least 7 percent and
exceed the 2008 peak of 73,516.81 this year as inflation begins
to slow in the third quarter, said Bastos, who oversees $53
billion in investments in the region. The equity benchmark
trades at 11.6 times reported earnings, near the lowest since
December 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The valuations in  Brazil  are very attractive,” Bastos
said in an interview from  Hong Kong . “Between now and the end
of the year, with the inflection point in inflation and the
market beginning to anticipate interest-rate reductions in 2012
likely, we should be able to expect a rally.”  The Bovespa has slipped 0.9 percent this year amid concern
that rising prices will reduce economic growth in  South
America ’s largest economy. The measure posted its first weekly
decline in a month last week after policy makers doubled a tax
on consumer loans to try to curb inflation.  The benchmark for Brazilian equities has lagged  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index and Micex Stock Index of Russian shares,
which have both gained more than 8 percent in 2011. The Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index has dropped 5.2 percent this year,
until April 8.  Bastos said the Brazilian central bank may raise  interest
rates  by 1 percentage point to 12.75 percent by the end of the
year. Inflation in Brazil will peak in the third quarter and
will be followed by falling interest rates in 2012, he said.  Policy makers are trying to cool the economy after
inflation in March reached 6.3 percent, the fastest pace in 28
months. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus
or minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
