France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s Orange  Spain 
predicts it will add customers and increase sales this year even
as the country’s economy struggles,  El Economista  reported,
citing Jean Marc Vignolles, head of Spanish operations.  The phone company expects to boost 2011 revenue and the
number of mobile and broadband customers, El Economista said,
citing an interview with Vignolles. Orange Spain will present a
new five-year program in May, the newspaper said.  Orange, the third-largest phone operator in Spain, aims to
grow without being obsessed about overtaking  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,
the No. 2 operator, the publication reported.  Orange Spain aims to double sales from emerging markets
and increase the number of customers in those countries by
50 percent in order to reach 300 million subscribers in 2015, El
Economista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
