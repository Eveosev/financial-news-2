Munich prosecutors charged a former
Ferrostaal AG management board member and a former manager with
paying bribes of more than 62 million euros ($90 million) to
obtain submarine orders from Greece and  Portugal .  Investigators also asked the court to make the company a
party in the criminal proceedings, which would allow the seizure
of Ferrostaal profits from the sales, Munich prosecutors said in
an e-mailed statement today. Talks with the company to settle
the issue faltered, Barbara Stockinger, a spokeswoman for the
prosecutors, said in an interview.  The talks failed because Ferrostaal refused to accept a
fine of 196 million euros over the issue, Handelsblatt reported
today, citing unidentified people close to the investigation.  Ferrostaal, based in Essen,  Germany , didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment. The two men charged weren’t
identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
