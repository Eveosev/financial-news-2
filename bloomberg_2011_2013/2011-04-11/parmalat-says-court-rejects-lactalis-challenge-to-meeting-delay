Parmalat SpA (PLT)  said an Italian court
upheld its board’s decision to delay a shareholder meeting and
rejected a challenge by the dairy company’s biggest investor,
Groupe Lactalis, to the suspension of the assembly.  The Parma court ruled that the board’s decision complied
with a March 25 government decree, Parmalat said today in a
statement. The decree allowed Parmalat to reschedule the
meeting, where shareholders were due to vote on the appointment
of candidates to the company’s board.  Parmalat, Italy’s largest dairy producer, decided on April
1 to delay the meeting, which had been scheduled for this week.
Lactalis, the owner of a 29 percent stake, had planned to
replace the board with its own candidates.  Italy  has taken steps to try to block Lactalis, including
allowing Parmalat to delay its assembly, giving Italian
investors time to mount a defense. The shareholders are now
scheduled to meet between June 25 and June 28. Lactalis said the
board’s decision to delay the assembly was “illegitimate.”  The Italian government has also authorized the state lender
to buy shares in companies identified as “strategic.” European
Union antitrust chief  Joaquin Almunia  said last week that
countries in the 27-nation bloc mustn’t raise “protectionist
barriers” and he may review Lactalis’s investment in Parmalat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
