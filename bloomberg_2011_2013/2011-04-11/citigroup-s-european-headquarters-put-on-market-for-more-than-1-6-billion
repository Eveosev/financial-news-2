Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s European
headquarters in  London ’s Canary Wharf were put up for sale by
Glenn Maud and Derek Quinlan for more than the 1 billion pounds
($1.6 billion) they paid for the building four years ago.  The 42-story tower at 25 Canada Square generates annual
rental income of 57.6 million pounds, according to a statement
today from  Jones Lang  LaSalle, the property broker conducting
the sale. The company didn’t give a specific price tag.  Duncan Smith, a London-based spokesman for Citigroup,
declined to comment on the sale. The building, the third-tallest
in the U.K., is the New York-based bank’s base for Europe, the
Middle East and Africa.  Rents in Canary Wharf are lower than the City of London,
the capital’s main financial district, making office properties
less attractive to investors. The buyer of 25 Canada Square
could expect an annual income of almost 70 million pounds within
ten years of acquiring the building, which has 1.2 million
square feet (113,800 square meters) of space, Jones Lang said.  Maud and Quinlan bought the 200-meter (655 feet) tower in
July 2007 from the  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS)  It was
built in 2001 and is 35 meters lower than Canary Wharf’s tallest
building, One Canada Square.  To contact the reporter on this story:
