The United Arab Emirates stock
markets are “on the right track” to being upgraded at MSCI
Inc. as the so-called delivery-versus-payment system starts this
month, the Dubai Financial Market PJSC chief executive officer
said.  “We have set the market on the right track and it’s left
to the market participants to react,” Essa Kazim said in a
phone interview today. “MSCI makes its judgement based on that
feedback.” DvP is one of the MSCI criteria for emerging market
status.  Foreign ownership limits are controlled by companies and
short-selling, borrowing and lending are part of a second phase
of changes, Kazim said.  “There are foreign ownership restrictions in one way or
another in some emerging markets," Kazim said. "This is not a
clear cut rule that makes markets ineligible for promotion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
