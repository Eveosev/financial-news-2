U.K. 10-year government bond yields
reached the highest in almost eight weeks after  Bank of England 
policy maker  Andrew Sentance  signaled he voted for a half-point
interest-rate increase this month.  Two-year yields were little changed as the country prepared
to sell about 11.5 billion pounds ($18 billion) of debt this
week, ranging from 28-day bills to 2040 bonds. Financial markets
suggest that the Bank of England’s main rate could climb to 2
percent next year, Sentance told Sky News yesterday. The pound
rose against the euro and traded near its strongest since
January 2010 versus the dollar.  “There’s no sign that prices are letting up and the market
should be reminded that there’s a good volume of supply this
week,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at Monument
Securities Ltd. in  London . “Gilts are a market that’s living on
borrowed time.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt was one basis point higher at
3.82 percent at 4.09 p.m. in London after reaching 3.83 percent,
the most since Feb. 17. The 4.75 percent security due August
2020 fell 0.11, or 1.1 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
99.445. Two-year yields were at 1.40 percent.  A government report tomorrow will show inflation stayed at
the highest level in almost 2 1/2 years in March, according to
the median prediction of 30 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
The 10-year yields climbed six basis points on March 8 after a
report showed the cost of goods at factory gates increased 0.9
percent in March, compared with the 0.6 percent median
prediction of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Pound Gains  The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.6408 after appreciating
to $1.6428 on March 8, the most since Jan. 19, 2010. It gained
1.7 percent last week, the biggest increase since the five days
ending January 14. Sterling was 0.4 percent stronger at 88.06
pence per euro.  Any gains by the pound before tomorrow’s inflation report
probably won’t last as policy makers are likely to keep  interest
rates  unchanged while they focus on safeguarding the economic
recovery, according to Citigroup Inc.  “It still seems that the concerns about growth outweighed
the risks to inflation outlook” when the Bank of England kept
interest rates unchanged last week,  Valentin Marinov , a London-
based strategist at Citigroup wrote in a client note today.
“Any gains in sterling ahead of the CPI release could prove
difficult to sustain.”  Rates Held  Sterling has strengthened 1 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which measure the 10
most widely traded currencies. It has trailed the euro’s 4.1
percent gain amid signs that the  European Central Bank  would
raise rates faster than the Bank of England.  The U.K. central kept the main interest rate at 0.5 percent
on April 7 as predicted by all economists in a Bloomberg survey,
while the ECB increased its main refinancing rate to 1.25
percent from 1 percent. Investors have priced in a 50 basis-
point gain in the key U.K. rate by December, according to
forward rates on the sterling overnight interbank average, or
Sonia, compiled by Tullett Prebon Plc.  Gilts lost investors 0.7 percent since March 31, pushing
their 2011 losses to 1.5 percent, according to indexes compiled
by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. German bunds have lost 0.8
percent this month while  U.S. Treasuries  have returned minus 0.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
