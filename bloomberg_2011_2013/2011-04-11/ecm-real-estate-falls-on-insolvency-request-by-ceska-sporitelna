ECM Real Estate Investments AG (ECM)  fell
to its lowest ever after a creditor filed an insolvency proposal
against the property developer with a Czech court.  The stock tumbled 10 percent to 73.5 koruna at 4:24 p.m. in
Prague, ECM’s lowest close since joining the Czech bourse in
December 2006. That valued the Luxembourg-registered company at
504.8 million koruna ($30 million). More than 43,000 shares
changed hands, or nine times the three-month daily average.  Ceska Sporitelna AS said today it had asked the court to
start an insolvency case and order a business reorganization at
ECM to satisfy creditors’ claims. ECM owes the Czech unit of
Erste Group Bank AG 7.22 million koruna in overdue interest
payments on bonds, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
