European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Patrick Honohan  said the ECB’s statement that it
has not decided on a series of interest-rate increases is
another way of saying it never pre-commits to a particular path,
Market News International reported, citing an interview.  Honohan, who heads Ireland’s central bank, also said he
doesn’t expect to see “any major action” from the ECB in terms
of steps to wean addicted banks off its financing, Market News
reported. Action to solve banks’ over-reliance on ECB funds
would have to “come primarily from governments,” MNI quoted
Honohan as saying.  Honohan added that the increase in the ECB’s main
refinancing rate to 1.25 percent last week would not cause
Ireland itself further difficulties in servicing its debt, as
government borrowing costs are “far removed” from the ECB’s
policy rate, MNI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
