Ads on Facebook Inc.’s site cost 40
percent more per click last quarter than in the previous three
months, as the company’s social-networking dominance let it
command higher prices, according to Efficient Frontier.  The increase was on Facebook’s self-service ads, not the
higher-priced premium ads that run on user home pages, said
Siddharth Shah, senior director of business analytics at
Sunnyvale,  California , based- Efficient Frontier .  “As advertisers are understanding this medium, they are
allocating budgets, and it’s becoming increasingly
competitive,” said Shah, whose firm helps companies buy online
ads. “They are willing to pay a lot more to get to the
consumer.”  Facebook, which has more than 500 million users, is
parlaying its burgeoning popularity into higher ad revenue.
Advertising spending on the site will more than double to $4.05
billion this year, according to research firm  EMarketer Inc.  in
 New York .  The company may have reached $2 billion in sales last year,
three people familiar with the matter said in December.
Facebook announced in January that it raised $1.5 billion
from investors led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., placing a $50
billion valuation on the closely held business.  Facebook, founded in 2004, passed Google last year to
become the most visited website in the U.S., according to
Experian Hitwise, an Internet-tracking company in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
