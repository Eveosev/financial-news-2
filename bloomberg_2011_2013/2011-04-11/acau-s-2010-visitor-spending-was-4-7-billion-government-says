Visitors to Macau spent 37.9
billion patacas ($4.7 billion), or 1,518 patacas per capita,
excluding gambling, last year, the Chinese city’s government
said, without providing comparative year-earlier numbers.  Mainland Chinese spent the most, an average of 2,039
patacas per capita, the Statistics and Census service said in a
statement posted on its website today. The average length of
stay of the 25 million visitors to the city was 0.9 day.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
