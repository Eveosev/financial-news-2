Cooler weather in the Midwest, East
and South is expected from April 16 to April 20 following a
short-term warming trend, according to  Matt Rogers , president of
 Commodity Weather Group LLC .  “We are expecting a fairly widespread cooling trend,”
Rogers said in a note to clients today. “The models are
(finally) in excellent agreement on this and the strongest cool
anomalies are favored over the Midwest and Plains.”  Above-normal temperatures forecast for the Southwest and
Southern California are an exception to the cooling trend,
Rogers wrote. “The heat could be stronger at times compared to
our latest forecast.”  Natural gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for potential impact on planting
and yields.  Over the 11- to 15-day outlook, some warming returns to the
East Coast and South, Rogers said, referring to the period from
April 21 to April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
