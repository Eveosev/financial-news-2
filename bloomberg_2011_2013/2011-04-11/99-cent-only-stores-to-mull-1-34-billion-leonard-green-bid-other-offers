99-Cent Only Stores, the U.S.
discount chain, formed a special committee to evaluate a $1.34
billion takeover proposal by members of its founding family and
Leonard Green & Partners LP, as well as other options.  The City of Commerce, California-based company said the
panel is made up of independent directors Lawrence Glascott,
Marvin Holen and Peter Woo. The three were previously asked to
evaluate a $19.09-a-share cash offer March 10 by Leonard Green
Partners, the company said in a statement today.  Dollar stores have become takeover targets in the U.S.
after grabbing shoppers from traditional retail chains including
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  Family Dollar Stores Inc. last month
rejected an unsolicited takeover bid by  Nelson Peltz ’s Trian
Fund Management, saying it undervalues the second-largest U.S.
dollar store chain.  The Schiffer-Gold family, 99-Cent Only’s founders, has said
that they will consider other possible bidders. The family owned
about a third of the company as of March 11.  99-Cent Only, led by Chief Executive Officer Eric Schiffer,
sells items from toys to pet food to cleaning supplies for less
than $1. As of Dec. 25, it had no debt and cash of $24 million,
an increase of 21 percent from a year earlier, according to its
third quarter earnings statement Feb. 2. During the period,
revenue advanced 1.8 percent to $365.4 million.  99-Cent Only rose 45 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $20.25 at
4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have climbed 27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
