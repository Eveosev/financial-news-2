Bank of Moscow’s President Andrei
Borodin and shareholder Lev Alaluyev sold their stakes in the
lender, totaling 20.3 percent, to Vitaly Yusufov, who owns
Nordic Yards and is the son of  Russia ’s former energy minister,
 Vedomosti  reported, citing an unidentified bank shareholder.  Yusufov borrowed $1.1 billion from Bank of Moscow, secured
on Nordic Yards, to help buy the stake, according to the report.
Vedomosti cited Borodin as saying he’s dissatisfied with the
price he got, which was “significantly less than $1.5
billion.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
