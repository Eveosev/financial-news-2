Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) , Latin
America’s second-largest beef producer, agreed to form two
Chinese joint ventures that will invest $309 million to boost
sales in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Marfrig and Beijing-based Cofco Ltd. will jointly invest
$252 million in six food-distribution centers in  China , Marfrig
Chief Executive Officer Marcos Molina said in an interview in
Beijing. Sao Paulo-based Marfrig said later in a regulatory
filing that it also agreed to a venture with Weifang, China-
based Chinwiz to invest $57 million in poultry production.  “Our presence in China is strategic because it is a fast-
growing market," Molina said in the interview today.  Marfrig’s subsidiary, Keystone Foods, will retain 45
percent of the venture with Cofco and 60 percent of the business
with Chinwiz. The joint-venture partners will retain the rest.  Marfrig rose 6 centavos, or 0.4 percent, to 15.71 reais at
10:22 a.m. in  Sao Paulo  trading.  JBS SA is Latin America’s largest beef producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
