BP Plc (BP/)  will ask the Russian
government for its approval to buy out its billionaire partners
in TNK-BP, possibly jointly with OAO Rosneft, in a last attempt
to move forward with the proposed alliance with Rosneft, the
Financial Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The share swap agreement with Rosneft expires on April 14
and BP must find a solution to the TNK-BP partners objections
before then or risk losing the Rosneft deal, the FT said.  While Rosneft said it hadn’t received any proposals on a
buyout, “if someone proposes something to find an exit before
April 14, then there’s always a way out,” the company said,
according to the FT. BP declined to comment, the newspaper said.  The Russian partners, Alfa-Access-Renova, have repeatedly
said they are not interested in selling, the FT said. The group
was focused on its arbitration with BP and on managing the
company, the FT said, citing a person close to the partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
