Indonesia ’s rupiah declined,
reversing earlier gains, on speculation the central intervened
to curb volatility.  The central bank is monitoring “the speed of the rupiah’s
gain,” Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution told reporters
in Bali on April 7. The country’s net foreign reserves rose to
$105.71 billion at the end of March, from $99.62 billion at the
end of February, according to data from the  website .  “The central bank’s target is to smoothe volatility,”
said Lindawati Susanto, head of foreign-exchange trading at PT
Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “With more foreign reserves,
it has the ammunition to intervene in the market and ensure that
the rupiah does not appreciate too fast.”  The rupiah lost 0.1 percent to 8,652 per dollar as of 4:35
p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 8,637 earlier, the strongest level since April
28, 2004. The rupiah has gained 3.6 percent this year.  Bank Indonesia  will keep its  reference rate  unchanged at
6.75 percent, according to all 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, after inflation slowed for a second month in March.
Consumer prices rose 6.65 percent last month from a year earlier,
compared with an increase of 6.84 percent in February, according
to official data released April 1.  “Investors are expecting Bank Indonesia to keep its
interest rate unchanged tomorrow and let the rupiah
strengthen,” said Susanto.  Ten-year  government bonds  rose, snapping a two-day decline.
The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell 10 basis
points to 7.70 percent, according to closing prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
