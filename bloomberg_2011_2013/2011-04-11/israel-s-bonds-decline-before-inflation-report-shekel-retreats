Israel ’s 10-year government bond
dropped, pushing the yield to a record high, before a report
this week that economists said will show inflation quickened.
The shekel fell.  The annual inflation rate accelerated to 4.4 percent in
March, the fastest pace in more than two years, from 4.2 percent
the previous month, according to the median forecast of nine
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The central bank on March
28 raised the benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to 3
percent, the highest since November 2008, to combat accelerating
inflation.  “Bond traders globally are increasingly pricing in a
scenario that global rates will move up earlier than previously
thought,” said  Jonathan Katz , a Jerusalem-based economist for
HSBC Holdings Plc. “The inflation story, interest-rate
expectations have pushed rates up globally.”  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 gained 4 basis points to 5.36 percent at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  Tel Aviv . The shekel weakened 0.2 percent to 3.4432 per
dollar as of 4:43 p.m.  The Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  is
scheduled to release the inflation report on April 15. In the
U.S., the Labor Department will probably say this week that
consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month from February, and
gained 2.6 percent from March 2010, according to Bloomberg News
survey.  Israel’s seasonally adjusted consumer-price index increased
at an annual rate of about 6 percent in the last six months, the
 Bank of Israel  said today in the minutes from its last rate-
setting meeting.  “Robust consumer demand in March will be rate hike
supportive at the next monetary meeting,” Katz wrote in a
report today. He expects a 25 basis-point increase to 3.25
percent at the April 24 policy meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
