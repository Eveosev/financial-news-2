TNT NV (TNT)  said its stake in the
express unit, which is expected to start trading in Amsterdam
separately next month, may be sold within six months if a public
offer for the spun-off company is made.  “If a public offer, whether friendly or mandatory, is made
for the company, TNT NV will be obliged to tender its ordinary
shares if the executive board and the supervisory board support
that offer,” TNT said in a  prospectus  published today.  TNT will hold a temporary stake of 29.9 percent in the new
company TNT Express NV, which it won’t sell within six months of
the split unless a bid for the former unit is made.  TNT, which had a legal monopoly on letter delivery in its
home country until 2009, began dividing the express and postal
businesses a year ago. The Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based company
said last week that demerger preparations have been completed,
and the TNT Express business’s stock should be ready to trade on
May 26, a day after shareholders vote on the separation.  TNT will also sell its shares in case an offer isn’t
supported by TNT Express boards, if 66.67% of the shares it
doesn’t own are tendered. If multiple offers for TNT Express are
made, the former parent will tender its stake under the offer
for which most shares have been tendered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
