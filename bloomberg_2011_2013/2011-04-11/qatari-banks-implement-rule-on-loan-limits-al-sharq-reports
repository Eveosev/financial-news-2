Qatari banks began to implement a
central bank rule that limits the amount of a loan and the
interest,  Al-Sharq reported,  without saying how it obtained the
information.  Qatari citizens can borrow no more than 2 million riyals
($549,000) on loans with a maximum maturity of six years, the
newspaper said.  Residents can borrow as much as 400,000 riyals on loans of
no more than four years. The interest rate that can be charged
was capped at 6.5 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
