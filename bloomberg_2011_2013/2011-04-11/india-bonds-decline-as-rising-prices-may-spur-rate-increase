India ’s 11-year bonds dropped,
pushing yields to a seven week-high, as investors pared holdings
on speculation rising prices and accelerating industrial output
will spur more rate increases.  An official report today will show factory production will
climb 5.1 percent in February, compared with 3.7 percent in
January, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 30 economists.
The wholesale  price index  rose 8.36 percent in March from a year
earlier, compared with 8.31 percent in February, a separate
Bloomberg survey showed before data due April 15. The central
bank, which has boosted borrowing costs eight times since March
2010 to damp inflation, next meets on May 3.  “Investors are probably factoring in more rate actions and
that’s reflected in debt yields,” said A.Y. Shedshale, a
Mumbai-based deputy general manager at Bank of Maharashtra.  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022
climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.15
percent as of 10:01 a.m.in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That’s the highest level since Feb. 18.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao predicted
last month that inflation would reach 8 percent by March 31 this
year, compared with a 7 percent estimate on Jan. 25.  A “monetary response is warranted” if inflation
accelerates, central bank Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  said
April 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
