A group of companies including
 Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  said they found gas and condensate off southern
Vietnam.  Two tests were carried out on the so-called Oligocene
section of the CRD-2X appraisal well on Vietnam’s Block 07/03,
according to  Australia ’s  Pan Pacific Petroleum NL (PPP) , which has a 5
percent stake in the area. A unit of Pitkin Petroleum Plc has a
40 percent stake and Premier, the operator, has 30 percent.  The well was drilled to evaluate a discovery made at the
block in 2009, Pan Pacific said in a statement today. In this
year’s drilling, one zone tested 17 million standard cubic feet
of gas and 1,730 barrels of condensate per day, while the other
tested 9.7 million cubic feet of gas and 870 barrels of
condensate, according to the statement.  “The positive results from the testing of the Oligocene
section in CRD-2X are very encouraging,” Pan Pacific Petroleum
said. “The well will now be sidetracked to further evaluate the
distribution of hydrocarbons in the Miocene sands.”  A unit of Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Development Co. has 15
percent, and a unit of  Vietnam  Oil & Gas Group has 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
