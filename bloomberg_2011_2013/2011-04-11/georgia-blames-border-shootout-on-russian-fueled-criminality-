Georgia  said Russia’s support for
“black holes of criminality” in the country’s two disputed
provinces led to a clash that killed a Russian border guard last
week.  The shootout in the breakaway region of Abkhazia on April 8
killed one Russian border guard and two Georgians, one of whom
was a wanted criminal, the Georgian Foreign Ministry said in a
 statement  on its website today, denying any involvement in the
incident.  The local Abkhaz prosecutor’s office opened a criminal case
for terrorism, Russia’s state-run news service RIA Novosti
reported on April 8, adding that the two killed Georgians were
members of the Interior Ministry’s special forces.  Russia routed Georgia’s army in a five-day war in August
2008 over South Ossetia, another breakaway region in the Black
Sea nation.  Russia  recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as
independent states after the conflict and agreed to defend their
borders. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s government
continues to claim sovereignty over the regions and says Russia
has occupied them.  The Georgian Foreign Ministry said shootouts between the
Russian forces and criminals over the division of spheres of
influence and money have become a fact of life in the two
regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
