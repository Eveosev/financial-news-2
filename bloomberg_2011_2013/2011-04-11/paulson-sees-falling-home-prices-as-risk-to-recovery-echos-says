U.S. home prices are unlikely to
rebound this year because banks aren’t willing to lend while
there’s uncertainty over their rights to foreclose, money
manager  John Paulson  told  Les Echos  in an interview.  The U.S. needs construction of at least 1 million to 1.2
million new homes a year for a solid economic recovery, Paulson
said, according to the newspaper. Less than 300,000 new homes
are being built, said the money manager, whose firm, Paulson &
Co., oversees about $36 billion.  “In my eyes, the major risk for the American recovery is
the stagnation of the residential real-estate market,” Paulson
said, according to the Paris-based financial newspaper. “It
will be difficult to have a rebound in real-estate prices this
year.”  The  Federal Reserve ’s economic stimulus plan creates a risk
of inflation, Paulson said. Because of that risk, the price of
gold can rise farther, he said.  While it’s possible the dollar will lose its status as a
 reserve currency , “it’s necessary to look at currencies in
relative terms,” he said. The U.K. is following a similar path
to the U.S. in terms of stimulus, and “the euro has its own
problems,” Paulson said.  With inflationary risks in the next three to five years and
the instability of the euro, gold provides protection against
 currency devaluation , he said. The firm has about 3 percent of
its assets in gold, and has created gold-denominated share
classes of its funds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
