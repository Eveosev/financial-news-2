AS Tallink Grupp, the largest
Baltic ferry company, reported a narrower loss for the fiscal
second quarter as higher passenger and cargo volumes boosted
revenue.  The net loss for the three months ending Feb. 28 was 9.4
million euros ($13.6 million), compared with a loss of 16.3
million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn-based company said in
a regulatory statement today. Revenue rose 19 percent to 188.8
million euros.  The company aims “to reach a optimal debt level which
would allow sustainable dividends in the future” as a new
strategic goal, it said. “In the management’s opinion the
comfortable level of the group’s net debt to EBITDA should be 5
times or less and the equity ratio to total assets around 40
percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
