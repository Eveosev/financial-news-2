Hungary implemented a new mobile-
frequency fee structure that seeks to boost investment in
infrastructure by offering incentives to the country’s three
mobile-phone network operators, an official at the country’s
regulatory agency said.  Under the new system, which went into effect on April 1,
mobile service providers will pay fees based on their usage of
frequencies and will only be required to pay half of the fee for
four years if they carry out “significant” investments,
Annamaria Szalai, president of the National Media and
Infocommunications Authority, said at a news conference today in
Budapest. Companies previously paid fees based on the number of
base stations they operated, she said.  “Magyar Telekom will only be paying a little bit less in
fees due to the new structure,” Magyar Telekom Nyrt. Chief
Executive Officer Christopher Mattheisen told reporters after
the news conference. “The new system, however, removes the
obstacles to the development of the mobile Internet market.”  Hungary’s three mobile service providers, Magyar Telekom, a
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Telenor ASA (TEL) ’s Telenor Zrt. and
Vodafone Hungary Zrt., have nearly 12 million subscribers
between them.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
