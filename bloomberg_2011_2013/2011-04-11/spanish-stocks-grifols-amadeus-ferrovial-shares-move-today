Spain ’s IBEX 35 index fell 40.4, or
0.4 percent, to 10,872.8 at 2:40 p.m. The Madrid Stock Exchange
General Index also slid 0.4 percent today.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Spanish market. Symbols are in parentheses after company names.  Amadeus IT Holding SA (AMS)   climbed 0.8 percent to 13.81
euros, paring April 8’s loss. The Spanish flight-reservations
company was added to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s “conviction
buy” list.  Ferrovial SA (FER)   slipped for a second day in three,
losing 0.9 percent to 9.21 euros. The company’s Heathrow Airport
imposed a contract exempting itself from blame for airline
losses in cases such as December’s snowfall, the London-based
Times said.  Grifols SA (GRF)   jumped for a second day, adding 2.9
percent to 12.91 euros, the steepest gain in more than two
months. Traders who bet on mergers are the most convinced since
the offer was made in June that Grifols’s takeover of  Talecris
Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp. (TLCR)  will be completed, giving
speculators a chance for a 60 percent return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
