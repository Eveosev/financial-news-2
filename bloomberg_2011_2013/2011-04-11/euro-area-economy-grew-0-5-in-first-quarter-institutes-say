The euro area’s economic recovery
probably accelerated in the first quarter, three European
research institutes said.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation region may have
risen 0.5 percent in the first three months of the year from the
final quarter of 2010, when it advanced 0.3 percent, Munich-
based Ifo, Rome-based Isae and Insee in Paris said today in a
joint quarterly forecast.  Germany  is driving the region’s recovery as its companies
step up hiring and spending to meet booming export orders. The
 European Central Bank  last week raised its main lending rate
from a record low to curb inflation. At the same time,
peripheral euro-area countries such as Greece, Ireland and
 Portugal  are mired in a sovereign debt crisis.  Euro-area growth will slow to 0.4 percent in the second and
third quarters, the institutes forecast. They expect inflation
to average 2.6 percent in the first three quarters of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
