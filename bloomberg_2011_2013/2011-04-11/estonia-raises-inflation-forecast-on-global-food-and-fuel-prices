Estoniaâ€™s  Finance Ministry  raised
its forecast for annual inflation this year and next, citing
higher global food and fuel prices.  Average annual inflation will probably accelerate to 4.5
percent this year from 2.7 percent in 2010, rather than slowing
to 2.5 percent as estimated in August, the Tallinn-based
ministry said today in an e-mailed statement. Price growth may
be 2.8 percent next year as global price pressures will ease,
compared with the previous forecast of 2.6 percent, it said.  Estonia qualified for euro adoption as inflation
accelerated from March 2010 following 10 months of deflation.
Quickening price growth threatens to stifle the recovery in
domestic demand, while export growth will probably slow, the
central bank has said in past months.  Gross domestic product will probably expand 4 percent this
year and in 2012, the ministry said, in line with a forecast
from Finance Minister Juergen Ligi in January. The ministry in
August estimated the $19 billion economy may grow 3.6 percent in
2011 and 4 percent in 2012.  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the largest Baltic lender, last week forecast
Estonian inflation at 3.8 percent this year and 3.2 percent in
2012. SEB AB, the second-largest lender in the region, said last
month price growth will average 4 percent this year and 5
percent in 2012 due to rising utilization of resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
