Andy Carroll’s first goals since
his 35 million pound ($57 million) move to Liverpool lifted his
team to a 3-0 English Premier League win against  Manchester
City .  Carroll opened the scoring in the 13th minute with a long-
range left-foot shot at Anfield last night. Dirk Kuyt made it 2-
0 in the 34th minute and Carroll added his second a minute later
when he glanced in Raul Meireles’s cross with his head.  Liverpool signed 6-foot-3 striker Carroll from Newcastle in
January as a replacement for Fernando Torres, who was sold to
Chelsea for 50 million pounds, a record fee between U.K. clubs.
Torres has failed to score in 10 appearances for the Blues.  “It’s great to see the big man off the mark,” Liverpool
manager  Kenny Dalglish  said in comments posted on the club’s
website. “The first one was obviously a fantastic strike and
the second a good header. Dirk pushed his goal away well too.”  The victory leaves Liverpool sixth in the standings with 48
points, four ahead of city rival Everton and five behind fifth-
place Tottenham. Manchester City stays on 56 points in fourth,
the final qualifying spot for  Europe ’s elite Champions League.  City captain Carlos Tevez sustained a hamstring injury that
will probably keep the Argentine striker out of the F.A. Cup
semifinal against  Manchester United  in four days, according to
City manager  Roberto Mancini .  “It will be very difficult for Saturday,” Mancini told
City’s website. “We will try, but we probably need another two
weeks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
