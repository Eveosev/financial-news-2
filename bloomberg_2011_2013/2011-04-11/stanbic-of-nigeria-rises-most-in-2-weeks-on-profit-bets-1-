Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , a Nigerian
lender, rose the most in more than two weeks on speculation
loans increased in the first quarter through March, boosting
profit, according to Vetiva Capital Management Ltd.  The stock gained 35 kobo, or 4 percent, to 9.06 naira by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos.  Stanbic is expected to increase loans by 7 percent to 8
percent, “and that will be positive for earnings,” Abiola
Razaq, a Lagos-based banking analyst at Vetiva, said by phone.  Lending advanced 41 percent in 2010, Chief Financial
Officer Ronald Pfende said on March 29.  Stanbic’s shares have fallen by 1.5 percent this year,
compared with a 0.4 percent increase in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
