Oil fell from a 30-month high after
the  International Monetary Fund  cut its growth forecasts for the
U.S. and Japan, dragging down shares of energy producers and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The difference between yields on
Treasury 10-year notes and inflation-protected securities
widened to the most in three years.  Crude futures slumped 3.2 percent to $109.16 a barrel at 4
p.m. in New York after settling at $109.92. The  S&P 500  lost 0.3
percent to 1,324.46 as energy companies in the index fell 1.9
percent, with  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  losing 4.4 percent. The
yield gap between 10-year notes and Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities increased to as much as 2.67 percentage points, the
most since March 2008. The yen gained versus its 16 major
counterparts after a 6.6-magnitude earthquake in Japan.  The IMF reduced its forecast for U.S. growth in 2011 to 2.8
percent from 3 percent, citing  oil prices  at the highest levels
since 2008 and the pace of  job creation  in the world’s biggest
economy. The Washington-based lender cut its Japan projection to
1.4 percent from 1.6 percent. In the Treasury market, break-even
rates widened before reports this week forecast to show growth
in consumer prices is accelerating.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  fell 0.8 percent
before reporting quarterly results after markets close today.  “Investors are using the IMF report as an excuse to drift
lower before we get more information from company earnings,”
said Michael Gibbs, Memphis, Tennessee-based chief equity
strategist at Morgan Keegan Inc., which has $80 billion in
client assets. “What we don’t know is how much the Japanese
earthquake is going to affect earnings, and we want to hear how
companies’ guidance is going to be impacted by the higher energy
prices.”  Libyan Cease-Fire  Futures also dropped after the  African Union  said Libyan
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  agreed to a cease-fire plan. Oil had
surged 32 percent to $112.79 a barrel in the past year.  The S&P 500 declined for a third straight day as energy
companies slumped. The benchmark measure of U.S. shares fell 0.3
percent last week, ending a two-week winning streak that had
added 4.2 percent.  Anadarko Petroleum  and  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  slumped
at least 3.1 percent as oil fell.  General Motors Co. (GM)  retreated
2.4 percent after China said 2011 car sales may grow more slowly
than estimated.  Tyco International Ltd. (TYC)  rose 3.3 percent as
people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News that
Schneider Electric SA is weighing a takeover offer for the maker
of security systems.  Beating Estimates  The S&P 500 rose 5.6 percent in 2011 through April 8 amid
government stimulus measures and as corporate profits beat
analysts’ estimates for an eighth straight quarter. Earnings for
S&P 500 companies rose 12 percent in the first quarter and will
increase 17 percent this year, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Alcoa reported first-quarter profit excluding some items of
28 cents following the close of U.S. exchanges, becoming the
first Dow Jones Industrial Average company to post results for
the period. It beat the average analyst estimate of 27 cents.  Global gross domestic product will grow 4.4 percent in
2011, matching the previous estimate, according to IMF’s World
Economic Outlook report.  Consumer spending , the biggest part of
the  U.S. economy , faces headwinds from the rising cost of food
and gasoline. Federal Reserve officials last month said the
expansion is on “firmer footing,” lessening the need to extend
a bond purchase program beyond June.  “Recovery in the labor market remains lackluster,” the
IMF said in the report. “The drag on 2011 growth from oil price
increases largely offsets the boost from the Federal Reserve’s
unconventional policies and from stronger net exports.”  Trader Expectations  The yield difference for 10-year TIPS and comparable
Treasuries, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices
over the life of the debt known as the break-even rate, was 2.65
percentage points after reaching 2.67 points earlier.  Yields on 10-year Treasuries traded at almost a seven-week
high as the U.S. prepared to sell $32 billion of three-year
notes, $21 billion of 10-year debt and $13 billion of 30-year
bonds in three auctions starting tomorrow. Federal Reserve
policy makers  William Dudley  and  Janet Yellen  spoke against
removing record stimulus, citing high unemployment.  The yen rose from an 11-month low against the euro after an
aftershock of  Japan ’s March 11 earthquake discouraged demand for
higher-yielding assets. The dollar remained lower versus the yen
as Yellen said the gain in food and fuel costs doesn’t warrant a
reversal of monetary stimulus. The euro fell against the dollar
on speculation the European Central Bank’s recent interest-rate
increase may make it harder for nations including Ireland and
Portugal to contain debt.  The yen gained 0.6 percent to 122.04 against the euro, from
122.76 on April 8, reversing an earlier slide to 123.33, the
weakest level since May 5. Japan’s currency appreciated 0.2
percent to 84.60 per dollar, from 84.76, after touching 85.53 on
April 6, the weakest level since Sept. 21. The euro decreased
0.4 percent to $1.4426, from $1.4483, after reaching $1.4489 on
April 8, the highest level since January 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
