BHP Billiton Plc, the world’s
largest mining company, advanced to a seven-week high after
saying it successfully completed a $6.3 billion share buyback.  The stock jumped 6.80 rand, or 2.4 percent, to 287.50 rand
at 9:17 a.m., the strongest intraday level since Feb. 18.    The company bought back 4.4 percent of its issued shares at
a 14 percent discount to the market price, it said in a regulatory
announcement today.  BHP Billiton also doused speculation it plans to buy Royal
Dutch Shell Plc’s stake in Woodside Petroleum Ltd. and make a
A$46 billion takeover, according to a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
