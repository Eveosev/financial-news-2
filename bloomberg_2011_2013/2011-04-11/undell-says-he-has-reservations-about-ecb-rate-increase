Nobel Laureate  Robert Mundell 
expressed reservation today about last week’s decision to raise
interest rates in the euro zone announced by  Jean-Claude Trichet , president of the European Central Bank.  “I wish he hadn’t done it,” Mundell, whose research
contributed to the creation of the euro, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television. Mundell is a professor of economics at
Columbia University in New York.  It would be more appropriate to work toward compromise over
the different types of problems facing countries in northern and
southern Europe, he said, adding that “the quarter of 1 percent
is not going to make or break Europe.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
