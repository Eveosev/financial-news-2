Australian clubs began a A$20
million ($21 million) advertising campaign against lawmaker
Andrew Wilkie’s plan to limit how much people spend on slot
machines, which may curb revenue for companies like  Tatts Group
Ltd. (TTS)   Wilkie supported Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s minority
Labor government in return for so-called mandatory pre-
commitment on slot machines. That could crimp revenue to
companies that own gambling venues like Tatts,  Tabcorp Holdings
Ltd. (TAH) ,  Crown Ltd. (CWN) , Australia’s biggest casino operator, and slot
machine maker Aristocrat Leisure Ltd.  “Every poker machine player, whether they play 10 times a
week or 10 times a year, has to register to obtain a card,”
said Anthony Ball, chief executive officer of Clubs Australia
which represents 4,000 venues, on Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio. “We think that’s a license to punt.”  Tasmania state independent Wilkie wants laws to start 2014
that require people to set their own limit before they start
gambling to help reduce the country’s 160,000 severe gamblers.
Wilkie, one of the four votes the government needs to pass laws,
said he would end his support for Gillard if the laws aren’t
introduced. Clubs want a voluntary system.  “It’s as if the industry wants to sidestep the fact that
this is simply to do with harm minimization for poker machine
problem gamblers,” Wilkie told ABC radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
