Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) , after
rejecting  Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH) ’s unsolicited buyout
offer, said it sued that company for allegedly overbilling
Medicare in admitting patients to its hospitals. Community
Health Systems shares plunged.  Tenet seeks to compel Community Health Systems to disclose
how it admits patients to hospitals for “financial rather than
clinical purposes,” according to a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing today in which Tenet said it filed the lawsuit
in federal court in Texas.  Community Health, the largest publicly traded hospital
company in the U.S., bid $6 a share in cash and stock, or
$7.3 billion, in November to acquire Tenet. Tenet rejected the
offer in December, saying it wasn’t “remotely fair.”  “CHS is making false and misleading statements to Tenet’s
shareholders in the hope that they will exert pressure upon
Tenet to accept an inadequate offer,” Tenet said in the
complaint that was included with the  SEC filing .  Tomi Galin, a spokeswoman for Franklin, Tennessee-based
Community Health, didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment.  Tenet, based in Dallas, fell $1.35 cents, or 18 percent, to
$6.20 in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading at 10:35 a.m.
Community Health fell $14.79, or 37 percent, to $25.51., before
trading curves were implemented.  To contact the reporter on this story:
