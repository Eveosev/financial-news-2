Japanese stocks declined on the
lowest volume in three months after Citigroup Inc. downgraded
the country’s auto sector to “sell,” amid continuing supply
disruptions in the wake of last month’s record earthquake  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Honda Motor Co., and Nissan Motor Co.,
the country’s top three carmakers, declined at least 2.2 percent
after Citigroup cut its rating on Japan’s auto industry, saying
investors haven’t priced in the impact on earnings from the
earthquake and tsunami that hit on March 11. Sharp Corp. slid
0.8 percent after the electronics maker said a disruption of gas
supplies forced it to suspend some production.  Suruga Bank Ltd. (8358) 
tumbled 7.5 percent as the lender said one its borrowers has
filed for bankruptcy and may be unable to repay its loans.  “Investors are reluctant to buy stocks at prices higher
than the current level because it’s hard to gauge the earnings
outlook for carmakers and other companies,” said Toshikazu
Horiuchi, a market analyst at Cosmo Securities Co. in  Tokyo .  The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average fell 0.5 percent to 9,719.7,
the first drop in three days, at the 3 p.m. market close in
Tokyo. The Topix index slid 0.1 percent to 852.34, with about
three stocks advanced for every two that declined. The total
value of stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first
section was 1.22 trillion yen, the lowest since Jan. 5.  S&P Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.2
percent today. In  New York , the index dropped 0.4 percent to
1,328.17 on April 8 as oil’s rally to a 30-month high drove down
transportation shares and investors speculated a fight in the
 U.S. Congress  over the federal budget may shut the government
for the first time since 1996.  The Nikkei 225 fell 6.4 percent through April 8 from March
10, a day before the magnitude-9 earthquake hit. Stocks in the
Japanese benchmark are valued at 14.6 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.4
times for the Stoxx Europe 600.  Carmakers fell the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. Toyota lost 2.4 percent to 3,260 yen and was the
heaviest single drag on the index. Honda Motor Co. sank 2.2
percent to 2,903 yen, while Nissan Motor Co. fell 2.4 percent to
697 yen.  Citigroup analyst Noriyuki Matsushima cut his rating on
 Japan ’s auto companies to “sell” from “buy” and reduced
share-price estimates for the carmakers. Matsushima said total
operating losses in the sector may be the biggest ever after
last month’s earthquake disrupted the supply of parts and
limited electricity at factories.  Sharp, Suruga Bank  Sharp retreated 0.8 percent to 771 yen. The company
suspended production at two liquid-crystal display plants after
the quake caused a shortage of gas used to run equipment.  Companies usually reduce output rather than halting
production outright, so the stoppage was a “surprise,” Takashi Watanabe, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wrote in a
report dated today.  Suruga Bank, plunged 7.5 percent to 680 yen, the largest
drop in the Topix. The regional lender said there’s a
possibility that Maruwa Shoji, a borrower that filed for
 bankruptcy protection , won’t repay 16.9 billion yen ($200
million) in loans.  Barclays Capital  cut the bank’s rating to
“underweight” from “equal weight.”  Among stocks that rose, Tokyo Electric Power Co., the
utility that is battling to cool nuclear reactors crippled by
the tsunami in Fukushima, gained the most on the Nikkei and was
the most actively traded stock in Japan.  Asia ’s biggest utility
surged by the daily limit of 80 yen, or 19 percent, to 500 yen.  Tepco Surges  The company, whose stock price has dropped 77 percent since
the reactor accident started last month, will borrow or buy at
least 100 gas turbines with a combined capacity of 1 million
kilowatts to increase power supply during Japan’s summer, public
broadcaster NHK reported.  Kansai Electric Power Co. increased 2.4 percent to 1,858 yen
after the utility agreed to buy two Griffin Energy coal-fired
power stations in  Western Australia . The utility will team with
Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corp. to make the purchase.  Mining and energy-related companies also rose. Inpex Corp.,
Japan’s largest energy explorer, climbed 3 percent to 654,000
yen.  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) , the second-biggest oil
driller, advanced 1.7 percent to 4,155 yen.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 2.3 percent to $112.79 a

concern unrest may spread to other energy-exporting countries in
the Middle East.  To contact the reporters on this story:
