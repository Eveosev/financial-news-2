Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA)  advanced to a
two-month high after the United Arab Emirates’ biggest
investment bank said the Tunisian Financial Market Council
lifted the freeze on its brokerage accounts.  The shares advanced as much as 7.1 percent to 1.21 dirhams,
the highest intraday level since Feb. 9. Shuaa gained 3.5
percent to 1.17 dirhams at 12:17 p.m. in Dubai.  Tunisia’s regulator ordered 123 brokerage firms to suspend
securities trading, including Shuaa, until it could confirm that
there were no connections with individuals who are currently
under investigation by the authorities in Tunisia, Shuaa said
yesterday.  Lifting the suspension is one of the steps that have
“contributed to increasing confidence in Shuaa,” said Oliver Schutzmann, the company’s head of  investor relations .  Shuaa shares have surged 11 percent in the past month,
while the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of regional stocks has
advanced 4.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
