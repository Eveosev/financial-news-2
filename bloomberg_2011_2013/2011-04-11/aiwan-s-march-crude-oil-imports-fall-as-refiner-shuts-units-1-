Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude oil needs, reduced purchases of the fuel
last month after a refiner shut plants for maintenance.  Shipments fell 28 percent from a year earlier to 25.4
million barrels, the  Ministry of Finance  said in Taipei today.
The island’s March oil bill declined 2.3 percent to $2.63
billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505) , Taiwan’s only publicly traded
oil refiner, halted its No. 1 crude distillation unit March 13
for scheduled maintenance, Lin Keh-yen, a company spokesman,
said by phone March 14. The stoppage will last about 40 days, he
said. The company halted its No. 1 residue desulfurization unit
and No. 1 residual fluid catalytic cracker for maintenance along
with the crude processing plant, Lin said.  Crude distillation units heat the fuel and separate it into
oil products. Residue desulfurization units remove sulfur from
residual fuel. Residual fluid catalytic crackers convert heavier
refined products such as residual fuel into higher-value
products, including gasoline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
