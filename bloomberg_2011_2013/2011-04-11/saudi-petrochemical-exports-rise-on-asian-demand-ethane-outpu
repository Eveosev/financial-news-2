Saudi Arabia , holder of the world’s
largest oil reserves, boosted petrochemical exports in the first
two months of the year on rising demand from  Asia  and increased
local production of ethane, a feedstock.  The country shipped 4.65 million metric tons of
petrochemicals from its ports in January and February, up 6.8
percent from 4.35 million a year earlier,  Saudi Ports Authority 
said yesterday on its website.  Saudi Arabia increased crude output by 300,000 barrels a
day to 8.7 million in February, according to a Bloomberg survey
of producers, analysts and oil companies.  “The higher oil production results in an increased
associated gas production, which should partly alleviate fear of
ethane shortage,” al Rajhi Capital said in a report published
on April 9. Ethane accounted for 73 percent of the country’s
feedstock through 2007, according to the report.  Saudi Aramco  plans to increase its drilling rigs by 28
percent this year, allowing for more natural gas to be
extracted, the investment bank said. Demand from countries
including China and  India  should also boost petrochemical
makers’ first-quarter results, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
