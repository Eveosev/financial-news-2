Norway’s inflation was unexpectedly
unchanged in March, damping pressure on the central bank to
raise  interest rates  as soon as next month.  Underlying inflation, which excludes energy costs and
taxes, was unchanged from the previous month at 0.8 percent,
 Statistics Norway  said today. A 0.9 percent gain was forecast in
survey of 12 economists by Bloomberg. Underlying inflation has
held below the  central bank’s  2.5 percent target for 20 months.  “Another downside surprise to core inflation questions at
the margin whether Norges Bank will hike the key 2.00 percent
deposit rate at the next monetary policy meeting May 12,” said
Stein Bruun, chief economist at SEB in Oslo, in a note.  The krone weakened 0.5 percent against the dollar to 5.4093
by 10:22 a.m. in Oslo and fell 0.3 percent against the euro. The
krone has gained 7.5 percent against the dollar so far this
year, making it the fourth-strongest performer among major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Norway ’s central bank, which last raised the overnight
deposit rate in May last year has signaled it will resume
tightening either next month or in June. Policy makers will next
meet on May 12 to decide on rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
