A  $1.5 billion  cut in high-speed
rail funding, highlighted by Republican leaders in their budget
deal with the White House, won’t affect existing projects, said
Brie Sachse, a Federal Railroad Administration spokeswoman.  Lawmakers agreed April 8 to cut spending by $38 billion for
the last six months of the 2011 fiscal year, averting a
government shutdown. The government has been operating under
measures that continue funding for all programs at 2010 levels.  That means high-speed rail projects are still allotted $2.5
billion, as in 2010, even though President  Barack Obama  had
asked for $1 billion for the program in the 2011 fiscal year
ending Sept. 30. In the 2011 budget agreed to April 8, the high-
speed rail program will receive $1 billion, $1.5 billion less
than in fiscal 2010.  “That is a big chunk, although they’re giving the
president what he asked for, so he can’t complain,” said
Mortimer Downey, a senior adviser with  Parsons Brinckerhoff , a
New York-based design, engineering and construction-management
firm that focuses on infrastructure projects.  Even with the decrease, no money is being taken away from
existing projects that have received grants, such as those in
California and Illinois. The initiative has received $10.5
billion since Obama started it with the 2009 stimulus.  To date, $5.65 billion of that has been sent to states that
won grants.  Last week  $300 million was released to states
including  California , Connecticut and  Maryland , along with the
Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority.  Almost one-third of that will go to alleviate two
bottlenecks on the Northeast Corridor route from Washington to
 Boston  run by Amtrak, the national passenger rail service.  Maryland got $60 million to study replacing a 100-year-old
tunnel outside of Baltimore.  New Jersey  received $38.5 million
for the final design of a new bridge to replace the 100-year-old
Portal Bridge.  “They’ve rediscovered the Northeast Corridor,” Downey
said. “It looks like they want to get a base for making capital
investment, at least at the choke points.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
