Copper advanced for a fifth day to
the highest level in more than five weeks after  China ’s imports
rebounded last month, fueling optimism that demand is robust in
the world’s largest metals user. Tin jumped to a record.  Three-month-delivery copper on the  London  Metal Exchange
climbed as much as 0.7 percent to $9,944.75 per metric ton, the
highest price since March 4, and was at $9,891.75 at 4:22 p.m.
in  Singapore . The contract also climbed on speculation the
dollar may weaken further. Tin surged to a record $33,600 a ton.  “Imports rebounded strongly from February and this adds to
positive sentiment,” Wang Jingjing, an analyst at Founder
Futures Co., said from Hunan. “A large part of recent gains has
actually been driven by investors looking for an alternative to
the  U.S. dollar .”  Imports of copper and products by China rose 29 percent in
March to 304,299 tons, climbing from a two-year low of 235,469
tons in February, according to customs data issued yesterday.
Shipments fell 33 percent from the same month last year.  May-delivery copper on the Comex in  New York  gained as much
as 0.7 percent to $4.533 a pound, also the highest price since
March 4. The metal for June-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose for a fourth day, gaining as much as 1.1 percent
to 73,940 yuan ($11,312) a ton, the highest since March 7.  The dollar was little changed against a six-currency
basket, after touching a 16-month low on April 8 as U.S.
lawmakers pulled the government back from a shutdown by agreeing
to cut about $38 billion from federal spending this year.  The most-accurate currency strategists, as measured in data
compiled by Bloomberg, see no recovery for the dollar in coming
months as the Federal Reserve delays raising  interest rates 
after the end of its $600 billion asset-purchase program in
June.  Lead in London gained as much as 1.9 percent to $2,904 a
ton, the highest price since April 2008, and aluminum rose as
much as 0.3 percent to $2,720 a ton, the highest level since
September 2008. Nickel climbed 0.8 percent to $27,811 a ton
while zinc gained 0.6 percent to $2,548.50 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
