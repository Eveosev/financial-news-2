RWE AG (RWE)  Chief Executive Officer
 Juergen Grossmann  said electricity prices on exchanges have
risen as much as 20 percent since the German government
introduced a moratorium on nuclear plants, according to a guest
commentary in Handelsblatt newspaper.  Germans want affordable energy prices, maximum
environmental protection and power-plant security as well as
independent German utilities and none of this will be easier to
achieve if international investors buy German utilities or
electricity is imported from abroad, he wrote.       Renewable energy in Germany will require investments such
as 3,000 kilometers in new cables to transport power from off-
shore wind turbines, Grossmann wrote. The quicker Germany
eliminates nuclear power, the faster carbon-dioxide emissions
will initially rise, he said in the commentary.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
