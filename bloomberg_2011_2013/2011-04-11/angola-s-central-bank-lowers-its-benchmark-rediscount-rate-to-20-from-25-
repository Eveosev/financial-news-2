Angola cut its benchmark rediscount
rate by five percentage points on April 6, the bank said on its
website.  The rate the central bank charges commercial lenders
to borrow money was lowered to 20 percent from 25 percent, the
Luanda-based National Bank of Angola said.  The bank didnâ€™t provide reasons for the cut, which reverses
a similar increase in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
