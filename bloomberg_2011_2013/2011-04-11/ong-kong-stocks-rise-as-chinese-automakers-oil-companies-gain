Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell
the most in two weeks as Chinese developers dropped, after
Premier Wen Jiabao asked local governments to help control
growth in housing prices.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled developer,
dropped 3.7 percent.  China ’s exports grew faster than expected,
raising concern the government may strengthen its fight against
inflation. Hong Kong developers slid after home prices fell.
 China Gas Holdings Ltd. (384) , an energy supplier to mainland homes
and businesses, dropped 2.9 percent after Piper Jaffray Cos. cut
its rating to “neutral.”  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175)  gained
2.3 percent after the China’s car sales rose.  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.4 percent to 24,303.07 at the
close, the biggest drop since March 28, after rising as much as
0.3 percent. Twice as many stocks declined as rose on the 45-
member Hang Seng Index. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
Chinese companies’ H-shares rose 0.2 percent to 13,684.06.  “People are buying selectively,” said  Alex Wong , asset-
management director at Ample Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The
sentiment remains bullish, but people are not too keen on
certain sectors, like local property. People are a bit concerned
about  interest rates , and sales to residential projects are not
picking up too strongly.”  China Resources  slumped 3.7 percent to HK$15.06, while
Guangzhou R&F Properties Co., the biggest real-estate company in
the southern Chinese city, slid 2.8 percent to HK$11.32.  Shimao
Property Holdings Ltd. (813)  declined 2.6 percent to HK$11.86.  ‘Clear, Firm’ Resolve  The central government’s aim to control the property market
is “clear” and the determination is “firm,” Wen said during a
visit to eastern China’s Zhejiang province, according to a
statement on the government’s web site on April 9.  China’s exports jumped 35.8 percent in March and imports
climbed 27.3 percent, the customs bureau said yesterday. The
growth in exports beat the forecasts of 24 of 25 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey, while the gain in imports topped the 20.6
percent forecast.  “March export figures came in stronger than expected,
shrugging off the impact of Japan’s disaster and the surge in
oil prices,” said  Qu Hongbin , chief China economist at  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  in Hong Kong. “This reconfirms that inflation
rather than growth remains as the key risk for China. Get ready
for more reserve ratio and rate hikes in the coming months.”  Hong Kong property developers also declined after home
prices in the city fell 0.4 percent in the seven days ended
April 3 from a week earlier, according to Centaline Property
Agency Ltd.  Sino,  Cheung Kong   Sino Land Co., a Hong Kong developer controlled by
billionaire Robert Ng, slid 1.1 percent to HK$14.24, while
Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., a developer controlled by
billionaire  Li Ka-shing , slid 0.9 percent to HK$128.90.  China Gas Holdings Ltd., an energy supplier to mainland
homes and businesses, dropped 2.9 percent to HK$3.63 after Piper
Jaffray Cos. cut its rating to “neutral” from “overweight.”  The Hang Seng Index rose 2.5 percent last week, after a
report showed U.S. jobs grew faster than estimated, and as
Chinese insurers advanced after the government raised interest
rates, boosting their profit outlook. Shares in the gauge traded
at an average 12.9 times forecast earnings on April 8, compared
with 14.4 times at the end of last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Geely Automobile, a unit of the Chinese automaker that owns
Volvo Cars, rose 2.3 percent to HK$3.09, while Dongfeng Motor
Group Co., the Chinese partner of Nissan Motor Co., gained 2
percent to HK$13.28.  Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (1114) 
climbed 3.2 percent to HK$7.82.  PetroChina Gains  China’s passenger-car sales to dealerships in the first
quarter rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier to 3.8 million
units, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday.  PetroChina Co., the nation’s No. 1 energy producer, jumped
2.8 percent to HK$12.34, the biggest positive contributor to the
Hang Seng Index. The company’s Changqing field produced a record
10.8 million metric tons of oil and gas in the first quarter, an
increase of 24 percent from a year earlier, parent China
National Petroleum Corp. said in its online newsletter today.  Crude oil for May delivery jumped 2.3 percent to $112.79 a
barrel in  New York  on April 8, the highest settlement since Sept.
22, 2008.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index declined 0.3 percent to
24,345. The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for  Hong
Kong  stock options, gained 2.5 percent to 17.14, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 4.9 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
