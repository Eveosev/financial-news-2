Hanwha Chemical Corp., the third-
best performer in  South Korea ’s Kospi 200 index in the past year,
plans to spend 1.04 trillion won ($955 million) on a polysilicon
plant to help more than double sales within five years.  The plant will be able to produce 10,000 metric tons a year
of polysilicon, used in solar cells, when construction is
completed by July 2013, the Seoul-based company said in a
regulatory filing today.  The shares rose to a record as Hanwha bet orders for solar-
power equipment will gain as governments take steps to cut
 carbon emissions  blamed for global warming. In 2010, the
chemicals maker bought almost half of Solarfun Power Holdings
Co., the world’s fourth-largest maker of solar components.  The proposed polysilicon plant in Yeosu will generate more
than 500 billion won of sales in 2014, Hanwha said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The company aims to increase overall sales to 4.2 trillion
won this year and to 9 trillion won in 2015, compared with 3.6
trillion won in 2010, according to its website.  Hanwha has more than tripled in Seoul trading in the past
year, trailing only Korea Kumho Petrochemical Co. and KP
Chemical Corp. among  Kospi 200 Index (KOSPI2)  members.  The shares rose 0.8 percent to a record 48,700 won at 1:45
p.m. local time, compared with the 0.4 percent decline in the
Kospi Index.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
