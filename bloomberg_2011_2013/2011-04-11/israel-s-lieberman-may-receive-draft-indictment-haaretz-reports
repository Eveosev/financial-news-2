Israeli Foreign Minister  Avigdor
Lieberman  may receive a draft indictment today or tomorrow on
charges of fraud,  money laundering  and breach of trust, Haaretz
reported without saying where it got the information.  Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein will probably present
Lieberman with the draft so he has the opportunity to request a
hearing aimed at preventing an indictment, the newspaper said on
its website. Spokesmen for both Weinstein and Lieberman declined
to comment on the report.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
