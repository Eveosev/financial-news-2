Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest
state-owned oil company, will supply full contractual volumes of
crude to at least two customers in Europe next month, according
to refinery officials.  Aramco will provide 100 percent of cargoes sold under long-
term contracts, said two refinery officials, who declined to be
identified because agreements with the Middle East producers are
confidential.  Saudi Arabia  exported 690,000 barrels a day of Arab Light
and Extra Light crude to the 24 European members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in the
fourth quarter of 2010, the  International Energy Agency  said
last month in its monthly Oil Market Report. It didn’t ship any
Arab Medium and Arab Heavy grade to  Europe , according to the IEA
report.  Aramco will maintain full shipments to Asian refiners next
month. Its full export allocation follows a Dec. 11 decision by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to leave
output quotas unchanged for the seventh time since 2008.  OPEC exceeded its targets by 1.592 million barrels a day in
March, according to a Bloomberg survey of producers, analysts
and oil companies who follow the group’s output. That was less
than in February as the rebellion in  Libya  shut as much as two-
thirds of the country’s production.  Saudi Arabia raised its output last month by 300,000
barrels a day to 9 million, the survey showed. That was about
949,000 barrels more than its target of 8.051 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
