The viscosity spread for  fuel oil 
in  Asia  narrowed. Naphtha, gasoil and jet fuel rose for the
ninth day. Reliance Industries Ltd. sold a gasoil cargo in
Singapore.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil climbed 0.5 percent to
$696.50 a metric ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine
fuel, gained 0.8 percent to $682.50 a ton.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 64 cents to
$10.29 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. The premium of 180-
centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade fell by $1.75 to $14
a ton, Bloomberg data showed. A narrower viscosity spread means
prices of the higher-quality grade used at  power plants  rose
less than the lower-quality bunker grade.  In  Singapore , BP Plc bought two cargoes, each containing
20,000 tons of 180-centistoke fuel oil for loading May 7 to May
11, at a premium of $3.50 a ton above benchmark prices, traders
said. PetroChina Co. sold one of the cargoes to BP, while Gunvor
International BV sold the other.  Westport Petroleum Inc. sold two cargoes, each containing
20,000 tons of 180-centistoke fuel oil, to Hin Leong Trading Pte
at a premium of $3.75 a ton over benchmark prices. The two
cargoes were for loading April 26 to April 30.  Hin Leong also bought 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke fuel
oil loading April 26 to April 30 from PetroChina at a premium of
$3 a ton to benchmark prices for the grade.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur climbed 1.5
percent to $142.75 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Jet

ninth day to the highest level since August 2008.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude gained 83
cents to $24.48 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade, fell 5 cents
to 45 cents at 4:32 p.m. Singapore time, data from PVM Oil
Associates said.  Reliance Industries sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil
containing 10 parts-per-million of sulfur to BP at a premium of
$3.20 a barrel over prices of gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur
gasoil. The cargo was for loading April 26 to April 30.  Shell bought 200,000 barrels of gasoil containing 10 parts-

per-million of sulfur for loading April 26 to April 30 at a
premium of $3.10 a barrel from Vitol Group.  Vitol Group sold 250,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.25
percent sulfur for loading May 7 to May 11 to China

percent to $1,057 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. Prices
advanced for the ninth day, the longest rising streak since the
10 days ended Oct. 7. The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to
Brent, or the crack spread, fell to $111.03 a ton from $117.05
at the end of Asian trading on April 8.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline rose 0.6 percent to $129.05 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha
gained 30 cents to $13.50 a barrel. A wider reforming margin
signals that the profit from making gasoline over naphtha is
increasing.  Noble Group sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline loading
