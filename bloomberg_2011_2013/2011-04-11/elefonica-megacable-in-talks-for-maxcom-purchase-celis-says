Megacable Holdings SAB Chief
Executive Officer Enrique Yamuni said the company isn’t in talks
to buy Maxcom Telecomunicaciones SAB, denying a report by
Excelsior newspaper columnist Dario Celis.  In today’s  newspaper , Celis said Megacable and  Telefonica
SA (TEF)  were the most likely candidates to end up with Maxcom, which
he said was in the final stages of a sale. Yamuni told Bloomberg
News today in an e-mail that the report is “absolutely false.”
A Telefonica official declined to comment, and Manuel Perez,
Maxcom’s investor relations manager, said he had no information
about sale talks.  Maxcom, based in Mexico City, would fetch a price of more
than $110 million, Celis reported. Shareholders value the
company at 1.55 billion pesos ($132 million) in terms of market
capitalization, based on today’s trading.  Maxcom fell 12 centavos, or 2 percent, to 5.89 pesos at 4
p.m. New York time in Mexico City trading. The shares have
dropped 9.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
