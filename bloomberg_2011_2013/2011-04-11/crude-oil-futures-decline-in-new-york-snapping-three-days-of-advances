Oil fell in  New York , snapping
three days of gains, on reports Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
has accepted a cease-fire with rebels, easing concerns about
further unrest disrupting supplies from the country.  Oil dropped as much as 0.4 percent that Qaddafi agreed to
an African Union peace plan presented by South African President
 Jacob Zuma , according to the Associated Press and Reuters. Crude
surged 4.5 percent last week with a 2.3 percent gain on April 8
as Libyan fighting diminished chances output may return to full
capacity and as the dollar slumped against other currencies.  “This Qaddafi news is pressuring the oil market,” said
Serene Lim, a commodity analyst with Australia and New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore . “Also crude markets rallied
pretty hard last week so investors might be taking a breather
and consolidating at these levels.”  Crude oil for May delivery declined as much as 50 cents, or
0.4 percent to $112.29 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , and was at $112.44 at 10:21 a.m.
Singapore time. The contract earlier gained as much as 67 cents
to $113.46.  Futures rose $2.49, or 2.3 percent, to $112.79 on April 8,
the highest since Sept. 22, 2008. Oil has gained 34 percent in
the past year.  Brent oil for May settlement traded at $125.95 a barrel,
down 70 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The contract increased $3.98, or 3.2 percent, to end the session
at $126.65 on April 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
