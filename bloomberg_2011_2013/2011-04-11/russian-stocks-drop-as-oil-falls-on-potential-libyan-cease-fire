Russian stocks slid to a three-day
low as oil fell in  New York  after a German government official
said the  International Monetary Fund  cut its growth forecasts
for the U.S. and Japan.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 stocks lost 0.6 percent to 1,845.78
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, erasing an earlier gain of as
much as 0.5 percent. It was the lowest level since April 7. Oil
producers OAO Tatneft and OAO Lukoil fell 1.1 percent and 0.8
percent, respectively. OAO Uralkali, the country’s second-
biggest potash producer, decreased 2.9 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index dropped 0.5 percent to 2,113.69.  Oil for May delivery fell 70 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$112.09 in New York. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook predicted
higher  oil prices  and the pace of job gains will restrain the
U.S. economic recovery. Brent oil for May settlement slumped 66
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $125.99 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
