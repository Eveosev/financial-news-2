The Masters Tournament was watched
in 13 percent fewer households in the biggest U.S. markets than
a year ago, according to preliminary information, as South
Africa’s Charl Schwartzel captured the title and a final-round
rally by  Tiger Woods  stalled on the final nine holes.  Yesterday’s fourth round at Augusta National Golf Club was
watched on CBS in an average of 10.4 percent of households in
the top 56 U.S. television markets, compared with last year’s
12.0 equivalent rating,  CBS Corp. (CBS)  said in a news release.  This year’s ratings were the second-highest for the final
round in the last decade, up 18 percent from 2009 and up 1
percent from 2005, when Woods won the last of his four green
jackets as champion.  The 2010 tournament marked the return of Woods to
competitive golf after taking a break from the sport following
an admission of marital infidelity. He tied for fourth both this
year and last.  Phil Mickelson  won last year.  Woods shot a 31 over the first nine holes yesterday,
rallying from a seven-shot deficit to tie for the lead when
third-round leader  Rory McIlroy  began to falter. Woods managed
only an even-par 36 over the final nine holes, finishing at 10-
under.  Schwartzel birdied the final four holes for a 6-under-par
66 and 14-under total, two strokes ahead of runners-up Jason Day
and Adam Scott.  To contact the reporter on this story:
