Australian companies are paying
less interest on syndicated loans as the market revives and they
seek to refinance as much as A$80 billion ($84 billion) of debt
this year, according to  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)   Margins shrank by between 10 basis points and 20 basis
points since the end of 2010 as lending increased, Mark Garrick,
managing director and global head of loan syndications at
National Australia Bank, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The A$80 billion of refinancing doesnâ€™t include companies
borrowing to fund acquisitions, which is also increasing as
corporate confidence improves, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
