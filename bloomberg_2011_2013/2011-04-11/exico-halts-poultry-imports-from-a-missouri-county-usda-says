Mexico  and Singapore halted imports
of poultry products from Polk County in Missouri after a case of
bird flu was reported, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s  Animal and Plant Inspection Service .  There was a low-pathogenic influenza confirmed on a flock
of turkeys on a single farm in Polk County, Lyndsay Cole, a USDA
spokeswoman, said today in a telephone interview from  Fort
Collins , Colorado. Further testing showed that the birds no
longer have the flu strain, Cole said.  Mexico stopped imports of raw poultry and poultry meat
products derived from birds slaughtered on or after March 4,
according to a  report  dated April 8 on the USDA’s Food Safety
and Inspection Service’s website.  Singapore  stopped shipments of
fresh or frozen poultry meat from birds in Polk County on or
after March 30, a separate USDA  report  showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
