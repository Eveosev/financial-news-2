The top decision-making organ of
Tanzania’s ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, resigned
yesterday, Daily News reported, citing committee spokesman John Chiligati, who also left his post.  The committee’s resignation gives the CCM an opportunity to
select a new team to transform the party, Chiligati said,
according to the Dar es Salaam-based newspaper.  CCM is holding meetings this week for the first time since
the country’s Oct. 31 general election, the Daily News said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
