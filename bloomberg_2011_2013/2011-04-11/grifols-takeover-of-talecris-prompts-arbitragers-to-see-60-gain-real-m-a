Traders who bet on mergers are the
most convinced since the offer was made in June that  Grifols
SA (GRF) ’s takeover of  Talecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp. (TLCR)  will be
completed, giving speculators a chance for a 60 percent return.  Talecris, the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina-based
maker of protein therapies derived from plasma, has traded this
month within $3.40 of Grifols’s offer price, the smallest gap
since it agreed to be acquired by the Spanish company, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $4.5 billion deal, expected
to be completed June 30, would give investors an annualized
profit of 60 percent based on Talecris’s April 8 price, the
largest of any U.S. takeover closing after this week.  Investors have grown more bullish on Talecris since
Grifols, Europe’s largest maker of blood-plasma products,
extended the acquisition’s closing last month as it seeks
antitrust approval. While the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
blocked a 2009 takeover of Talecris by  Australia ’s  CSL Ltd. (CSL) ,
Grifols said last week it’s sure it will receive permission for
the deal. Short sellers have also reduced bearish bets on
Talecris, which is 49 percent owned by Cerberus Capital
Management LP.  “There is a high level of confidence that they’re going to
get approval any day,” said Peter Lobravico, New York-based
vice president of merger arbitrage trading and sales at Wall
Street Access. “I’m still taken aback as to why this has taken
so long.”  Becky Levine, a spokeswoman for Talecris, declined to
comment. Representatives for Grifols didn’t respond to requests
for comment outside normal business hours.  Today’s Trading  Shares of Grifols climbed 2.5 percent to 12.86 euros in
Madrid for the fifth-biggest gain in the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
Talecris rose 0.9 percent to $27.40 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Talecris has risen 71 percent since the acquisition was
announced on June 7 through last week, while Grifols gained 35
percent, pushing the value of the deal to $4.5 billion including
net debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Barcelona, Spain-
based company is paying $19 in cash and 0.6485 newly issued non-
voting Grifols share for each Talecris share.  On April 5 the spread between Talecris’s stock price and
the offer price reached $3.40, the narrowest since the
acquisition was announced, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
shares closed at $27.15 on April 8, 12 percent below the $30.79-
a-share deal price. If the transaction closes at that level on
June 30, traders who buy the stock now would realize a 60
percent annualized return, the data show.  ‘Bit More Optimistic’  “The Street has become a bit more optimistic of the deal
closing just from how the Talecris stock has been trading,”
said Hamed Khorsand, an analyst at BWS Financial Inc. in
 Woodland Hills ,  California .  The amount of short selling, or the practice of selling
borrowed stock on the bet the price will decline, in Talecris
fell to about 169,000 shares on April 5, according to Data
Explorers, a New York-based research firm. That’s 92 percent
less than the high of 2.17 million shares sold short on June 10,
three days after the takeover was announced, the data showed.  Short sales of Grifols have decreased by 45 percent over
the same span, according to Data Explorers.  Grifols is pursuing Talecris to expand its market share in
the U.S., which accounted for about 34 percent of its global
sales last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Talecris sells Gamunex, a treatment for immune-system disorders,
and Prolastin, a treatment for Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a
condition that can lead to  lung disease .  Antitrust Approval  Grifols, which originally forecast the deal would close in
the fourth quarter of 2010, most recently extended the deadline
to June 30 from March 6. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Victor Grifols said last week he’s still optimistic the deal
will be approved.  “I don’t know when we’ll receive the green light from the
FTC,” Grifols said at an event at  Madrid ’s stock exchange.
“I’m sure we’ll get it, but it’s a very long process.”  The company has pledged to give the FTC at least 30 days’
notice before closing. If the FTC blocks the deal, Grifols will
have to pay Talecris a $375 million breakup fee.  “It’s more likely to be approved than not,” said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps oversee $14.4 billion at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati. “The FTC seems to be willing to accept
conditions on mergers.”  Talecris was created as an independent company in 2005
after Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer AG sold its plasma
business to Cerberus of  New York  and Ampersand Ventures in
Wellesley,  Massachusetts . Talecris raised almost $1.1 billion in
a 2009 initial public offering.  ‘Still Wary’  While Talecris traded at the closest on record to Grifols’s
offer last week, the April 8 spread of $3.64 is still too wide
to indicate traders are confident the takeover will be approved,
according to Yemi Oshodi, managing director of M&A and special
situations trading at New York-based WallachBeth Capital LLC.  “The CEO sounds quite optimistic that he’s going to get
the deal done,” Oshodi said. “But the spread tells me arbs
remain wary. Investors are still wary that there’s an issue at
the FTC. This has taken an inordinate amount of time.”  The spread is also wider because the non-voting shares
investors receive in the transaction will likely trade at a
discount, Oshodi said.  Traders in the options market are also boosting their
bearish bets on Talecris to the highest level since the
company’s IPO. There were 3.86 outstanding puts to sell for each
call to buy on April 8, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  That compares with a put-to-call ratio of 1.33 on March 4,
the day that Grifols said it was extending the deadline for
completing its takeover of Talecris to June 30.  Failed Deal  CSL’s attempt to buy Talecris for $3.1 billion fell apart
in June 2009 because of opposition from U.S. regulators. A
successful bid would have helped CSL of Parkville, Australia,
overtake  Baxter International Inc. (BAX)  as the leader in the global
market for blood plasma-derived treatments such as
immunoglobulin, used for patients with weakened immune systems.  The FTC said the deal would have left CSL and Deerfield,
Illinois-based Baxter with 80 percent of the U.S. market for
immunoglobulin and albumin.  Grifols’s takeover of Talecris won’t face the same scrutiny
because its U.S. presence isn’t as large and the combined
company won’t dominate the market, said BWS Financial’s
Khorsand. Because the deal wasn’t immediately blocked, some
investors are betting the extensions mean regulators will
approve it, he said.  Combining Grifols’s $450 million in U.S. sales for its
latest fiscal year with Talecris’s $1.1 billion would still be
in line with CSL’s revenue of $1.5 billion in the Americas and
less than Baxter’s $5.3 billion in the U.S., data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “With Grifols it’s a different story,” Khorsand said.  Overall, there have been 6,700 deals announced globally
this year, totaling $670.8 billion, a 29 percent increase from
the $521.4 billion in the same period in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
