Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, reported first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates by one cent after the company’s realized
prices for the lightweight metal increased.  Net income of $308 million, or 27 cents a share, compares
with a loss of $201 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier, New
York-based Alcoa said today in a statement. Earnings excluding
restructuring costs and other one-time items were 28 cents a
share, topping the 27-cent average estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales increased 22 percent to $5.96 billion from $4.89
billion a year earlier, missing the average estimate of $6.06
billion from eight analysts in the Bloomberg survey. Alcoa
dropped 63 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $17.14 as of 4:48 p.m.
after the close of regular New York Stock Exchange trading.  The adjusted profit is the biggest since the company earned
37 cents a share in the third quarter of 2008, when commodity
prices tumbled amid the global financial crisis. Aluminum prices
have advanced 11 percent in the past year in  London  because of
improving demand for the metal, which is used in construction,
autos and beverage cans.  “Overall, I’d say they were pretty robust earnings,” John
Redstone, a Montreal-based analyst at Desjardins Securities,
said in a telephone interview. “The reason was slightly lower
costs but I wouldn’t say Alcoa beats or misses unless it’s plus
or minus five cents.”  Alcoa, traditionally the first company in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  to report quarterly earnings, said its
average realized price for aluminum rose 15 percent from a year
earlier to $2,682 a metric ton.  The company reiterated its forecast that global aluminum
demand will grow 12 percent this year.  “Our outlook for the rest of 2011 and beyond remains very
positive,” Chief Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
