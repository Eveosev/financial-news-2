Egis Nyrt., the Hungarian drugmaker
owned by Laboratoires Servier, decreased to the lowest in more
than three weeks on speculation the government may increase
taxes on pharmaceutical companies.  The shares retreated 1 percent to 18,820 forint by 9:28
a.m. in Budapest, a fifth day of declines. Gedeon  Richter Nyrt .,
the country’s biggest drugmaker, fell 0.7 percent to 38,230
forint, while the BUX index slipped less than 0.1 percent.  Hungary may raise a special tax on pharmaceutical companies
to 18 percent from 12 percent, Napi Gazdasag reported, citing a
document it obtained. The tax may be increased to as much as 50
percent on sales of subsidized drugs to help reduce health-care
expenditure, the newspaper said.  “The key question is whether they can continue to deduct
this from research and development costs,” Akos Herczenik, a
Budapest-based analyst at Raiffeisen International Bank AG, said
by phone. “If they can’t, then this will have a brutal impact
on Egis and a smaller effect on Richter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
