Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said its
Pulau Bukom ethylene plant in Singapore isn’t expected to start
before the middle of May, according to a statement e-mailed by
the company today.  Shell declared force majeure on some chemical contracts
from the plant because of unplanned operational issues, the
company said on March 21. Force majeure is a legal clause
allowing companies to miss deliveries because of circumstances
beyond their control.  The Singapore cracker complex has the ability to turn
naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas and heavy hydrocarbons into
chemicals. It has the annual capacity to produce 800,000 metric
tons of ethylene, 450,000 tons of propylene and 230,000 tons of
benzene, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
