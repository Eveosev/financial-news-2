William C. Dudley, president of the
 Federal Reserve Bank of New York , said the U.S. central bank
shouldn’t rush to tighten monetary policy.  “We’re probably going to have excess slack in the U.S.
labor market at least through the end of 2012, and that’s one
reason that colored my view that we shouldn’t be overly
enthusiastic about tightening monetary policy too early,”
Dudley told a forum in  Tokyo  today.  Fed Policy makers at a meeting last month differed over
whether to start removing stimulus this year, according to
minutes of their March 15 meeting. “A few participants indicated
that economic conditions  might warrant a move toward less-
accommodative monetary policy this year; a few others noted that
exceptional policy accommodation could be appropriate beyond
2011,” according to the minutes.  Since the March meeting, reports showed the labor market
and inflation have picked up while  consumer confidence  slipped
and new home sales dropped to a record low. Some regional Fed
presidents who were skeptical of stimulus have talked about the
need to tighten credit, and Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has yet to
indicate his preference for the Fed’s next move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
