Portugal received more airline-
passenger complaints than any other European Union country,
according to EU data that show  Spain  and the U.K. complete the
top three spots.  Air passengers in Portugal in 2009 filed 7,055 complaints,
of which 40 percent were for alleged violations of EU
legislation requiring carriers to provide assistance and
compensation for disrupted travel, according to the  European
Commission . That’s more than a fifth of the 33,060 complaints
made across the EU that year.  Spanish authorities received 6,931 complaints and U.K.
officials got 4,666 in 2009, the most recent year for which
figures are available, the  commission , the EU’s executive arm,
said in a  report  vowing tougher enforcement of the rules.
National authorities voluntarily provided the commission with
the data, which don’t identify the airlines that prompted the
complaints.  “The next big push will be to step up enforcement,”
European Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said in a  statement 
today in Brussels. “It is not enough to have rights on paper;
they must be applied on the ground.” Of the complaints in 2009,
which cover all EU nations except  Malta , sanctions were foreseen
in 1,075 cases, or 3 percent of the total.  The 27-nation EU requires airlines to pay compensation for
flight cancelations and overbookings and to cover the costs of
meals and hotel accommodation for passengers affected by
overbookings, cancelations and delays. The industry in 2006 lost
a court case challenging the air-passenger rights legislation,
which took effect in 2005 following EU approval the year before.  Flight Cancellations  In 2009, 44 percent of the total EU complaints related to
flight cancelations, 27 percent to delays, 11 percent to denied
boarding and the rest to issues outside the scope of the EU law,
according to the commission. In contrast to  Portugal , where the
4,213 complaints unrelated to the EU rules were the most
numerous in the bloc, all of the complaints in Spain and 99
percent in the U.K. were about cancellations, delays and denied
boarding, the commission said.  Complaints in 2009 numbered 3,073 in  France , 3,060 in
 Germany  and 2,625 in  Italy , according to the EU data. All the
cases in France and all except seven in Germany and 212 in Italy
were related to the EU legislation, according to the figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
