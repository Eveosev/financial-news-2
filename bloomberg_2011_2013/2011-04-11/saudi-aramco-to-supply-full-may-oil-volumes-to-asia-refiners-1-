Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will supply
full contracted volumes of crude to Asian refiners in May,
according to refinery officials.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will provide 100
percent of cargoes sold under long-term contracts for an 18th
month, according to refiners in Thailand and  Japan  who requested
anonymity, citing confidentiality agreements with the Middle
East’s biggest producer.  Saudi Aramco’s full export allocation follows a Dec. 11
decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
leave output quotas unchanged for the seventh time since 2008.
OPEC exceeded its targets by 1.592 million barrels a day in
March, according to a Bloomberg survey of producers, analysts
and oil companies who follow the group’s output. That was less
than last month and is because of the rebellion in  Libya 
shutting as much as two-thirds of the country’s production.  Saudi Arabia  raised its output last month by 300,000
barrels a day to 9 million, the survey showed. That was about
949,000 barrels more than its target of 8.051 million.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., the state-run producer in the
United Arab Emirates capital, plans to supply full volumes of
all four of its export grades, the officials said, citing
discussion with the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
