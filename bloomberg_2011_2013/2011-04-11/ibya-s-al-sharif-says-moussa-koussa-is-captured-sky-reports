Libya ’s Minister for Social
Affairs, Ibrahim Al-Sharif, said he wouldn’t comment on the
statement given by the country’s former Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa to the British Broadcasting Corp. despite having known
him for many years, because Koussa is “captured” and not free
to talk, Sky News reported. He said he wouldn’t comment on
anything Koussa says until he leaves the U.K. and goes to some
“neutral” country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
