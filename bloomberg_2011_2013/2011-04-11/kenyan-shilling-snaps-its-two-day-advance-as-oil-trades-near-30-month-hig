Kenya’s shilling weakened for the
first day in three against the dollar after oil’s advance to a
30-month high spurred importers to buy the U.S. currency to
purchase crude, according to CfC Stanbic Bank Ltd.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 84.22 per dollar at 10:34 a.m. in
Nairobi, the capital, from a close of 84 shillings on April 8.  “The loss is due to residual demand from importers as they
seek to buy the dollar to shore up their position in
anticipation of a weaker shilling due to expectations of a surge
in global crude prices,” Steve Lagat, a dealer at Nairobi-based
CfC Stanbic Bank, said in a phone interview.  Crude oil for May delivery fluctuated, rising as much as
0.6 percent before dropping 0.3 percent to $112.42 a barrel as
unrest in  Libya  disrupted crude output and investors purchased
commodities as a hedge against the declining dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
