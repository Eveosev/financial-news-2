Chunghwa Telecom Co.,  Taiwan â€™s
largest phone operator, posted first-quarter profit that beat
analyst estimates as a lower  tax rate  and increased demand for
data services helped counter higher costs.  Net income dropped 1.6 percent to NT$11.9 billion ($411
million), from NT$12.1 billion a year earlier, the Taipei-based
company said in a statement today. The average of four analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was NT$11.6 billion.  Chunghwa is turning to Internet television, high-speed
optical fiber data, and value-added wireless services to offset
slowing fixed-line and mobile-phone revenues. Net income was
helped by a cut in the corporate tax rate to 17 percent from 25
percent, it said in an exchange  filing  today.  Parent-level revenue in the first quarter rose 4.5 percent
to NT$47.6 billion, Chunghwa said today. Costs increased in the
first three months as personnel expenses climbed due to its
early retirement program and it paid higher subsidies for more
expensive smartphones, it said in a March 10 statement.  Chunghwa forecast 2011 net income may fall 4 percent from a
year earlier to NT$45.7 billion, it said in a Feb. 23 statement.  The stock fell 0.1 percent in Taipei to NT$91.50 at the
1:30 p.m. close of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
