Israel ’s economy is likely to
expand 3.8 percent this year and next, the  International
Monetary Fund  said in a report today, raising its forecast.  While the  IMF prediction  exceeds its Jan. 25 estimate of
3.5 percent, it is lower than the Bank of Israel’s March
forecast of 4.5 percent. The central bank is predicting growth
of 4 percent in 2012.  The IMF cited Israel, along with  Australia ,  Canada ,  Korea ,
Norway and Sweden, as countries in which economic conditions and
underlying price pressures are somewhat stronger than in other
advanced economies. Markets are expecting interest rate
increases of between a half-point and one-and-a-half points over
the coming years in these economies, the IMF said in its World
Economic Outlook report.  “Most of their policy rates remain accommodative, in a 1
to 3 percent range, and they will have to do more as
unemployment rates fall and food and energy prices put pressure
on wages,” the report said.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  raised the
benchmark interest rate by a higher-than-expected half-point on
March 28 to 3 percent, as inflation accelerated to an annual 4.2
percent, the fastest in more than two years. The economy
expanded 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter, the most in four
years.  Unemployment will drop to 5.5 percent in 2011 and 5 percent
in 2012 from 6.7 percent last year, the IMF predicted in today’s
report.  Consumer prices will rise 3 percent in 2011, compared with
2.7 percent last year, the IMF said. Inflation will slow to 2.5
in 2012, it said.  The current-account surplus will rise to 3.3 percent of GDP
this year from 3.1 percent in 2010, the IMF said. The forecast
for 2012 is 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
