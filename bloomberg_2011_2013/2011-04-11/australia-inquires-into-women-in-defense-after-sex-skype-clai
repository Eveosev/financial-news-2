Australia  launched an inquiry into
the treatment of women in its defense force after allegations a
female cadet’s sexual encounter with another cadet was relayed
on Skype Technologies SA’s software without her consent.  Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick will
assess how women are treated at the defense force, alcohol use
and social media, Defense Minister  Stephen Smith  said in
Canberra. A separate inquiry will look into the sex allegations,
he said.  “We need to drive home that inappropriate conduct in
uniform or as a representative of the Australian Defense Force
brings with it serious adverse consequences,” Smith told
reporters in Canberra today. The inquiry would look at “ongoing
areas of concern in relation to promoting appropriate conduct,
including the treatment of women, alcohol use and use of social
media and representational behavior more generally.”  An 18-year-old cadet, identified as Kate, told Network Ten
Holdings Ltd. on April 5 that her consensual sexual encounter
was transmitted without her permission to six other cadets in
another room.  To contact the reporter on this story:
