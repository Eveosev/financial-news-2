Olympic Entertainment Group AS (OEG1T) , the
only publicly traded casino operator in eastern  Europe , proposed
no dividend for last year.  Olympic won’t pay dividends for last year “since the group
has no retained earnings as of Dec. 31,” the company said in
its annual report on Tallinn stock exchange website today. It
earned a net profit of 1.1 million euros ($1.6 million) last
year.  Olympic had “almost 32 million euros in cash or
equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the year and very
small amount of debt,” Swedbank AB said in a research note to
investors last month. The company’s options include restarting
dividend payments, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
