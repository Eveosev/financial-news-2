Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan tea and
coffee grower, snapped three days on gains on speculation both
production and prices of tea leaves will climb.  The climbed 5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to 10.10 shillings at
the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital.  “Farmers are expecting higher prices because production in
India has fallen,” Wycliffe Masinde, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. “The  meteorological department  has announced
we might be seeing the end of the dry season. The impact on
production will be seen from the next three months.”  Tea exports from India, the world’s biggest grower after
 China , fell 11 percent in February to 11.93 million kilograms
from a year earlier,  Press Trust of India  said yesterday, citing
data from the Tea Board.  Kenya is the world’s biggest exporter of the black-tea
variety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
