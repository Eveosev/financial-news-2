Slovenia will focus on the campaign
to adopt pension reforms after voters rejected a so-called mini-
jobs bill, Delo newspaper  reported , citing Prime Minister Borut
Pahor.  Voters in the former Yugoslav nation rejected the
government’s proposal by an 80 percent majority with voter
turnout at about 34 percent yesterday, the Ljubljana-based daily
said.  The bill was meant to expand eligibility for more loosely
regulated jobs to the elderly and the unemployed, according to
Delo.  The country that adopted the euro in 2007 will face another
vote on the pension overhaul, probably in May, after the
Constitutional Court rejected the government’s assessment that a
referendum on the subject would endanger the system of social
benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
