ZenithOptimedia Group Ltd., a unit
of Publicis Group SA, cut its forecast for global advertising
sales growth this year to 4.2 percent from 4.6 percent,
 Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing ZenithOptimedia.  The company lowered its prognosis because of the earthquake
in  Japan , the debt crisis in the European Union and the rising
oil price, the newspaper reported today in an e-mailed preview
of an article due to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
