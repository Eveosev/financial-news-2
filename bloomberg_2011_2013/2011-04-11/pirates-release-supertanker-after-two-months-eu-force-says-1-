Somali pirates released a
supertanker almost two months after capturing the vessel,
according to the European Union naval force patrolling off East
Africa.  The Irene SL and its crew of 25 are believed to be heading
for a safe port, EU Navfor said in a  statement  on its website
today. The ship was hijacked Feb. 9 as it transported a 2
million-barrel cargo of Kuwaiti crude oil to the U.S. and
released April 7, the statement shows.  Attacks off Somalia were the highest on record last year,
with 49 vessels and 1,016 crew members hijacked, a January
report by the International Maritime Bureau showed. The raids
are adding at least $2.4 billion to transportation costs as
vessels are diverted onto longer routes, according to
Louisville, Colorado-based One Earth Future Foundation.  About 30 anti-piracy ships are deployed daily off East
Africa by groups including the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. EU Navfor patrols about 2 million square nautical
miles, or an area 10 times the size of  Germany .  The 1,100-foot supertanker was attacked while carrying
270,000 metric tons of oil, or about 2 million barrels, to the
 Gulf of Mexico , Enel SA, the shipâ€™s owner, said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
