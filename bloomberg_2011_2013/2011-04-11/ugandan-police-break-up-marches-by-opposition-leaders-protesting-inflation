Ugandan police said they broke up
two protest marches about rising inflation, arresting opposition
leader Kizza Besigye after he defied orders to cancel one of the
demonstrations.  Besigye was detained because the protest he led from his
home in Kasangati, about 17 kilometers (11 miles) north of
Kampala, the capital, interrupted traffic, police spokeswoman
Judith Nabakooba said by phone from Kasangati today.  “He was removed from the road where he had decided to sit
when he defied orders,” she said.  Besigye appeared in court and was released on bail, Major-
General Kale Kayihura, the police inspector general, said in an
e-mailed statement, without saying whether Besigye was charged.  The marches were organized to protest the rising cost of
living, especially food and fuel prices, said Margaret Wokuri,
spokeswoman for the Inter-Party Coalition. Besigye and the
leader of the  Democratic Party , Nobert Mao Mao, lost the Feb. 18
presidential election to President Yoweri Museveni. The vote was
rejected by four opposition contenders, who alleged
irregularities.  Today’s other protest, led by Mao, was dispersed by police
in Ntinda, a suburb of the capital, as they attempted to walk to
the city, Vincent Mayanja, the party’s deputy secretary general,
said by phone.  “The police fired bullets as they broke up the protest
walk,” he said. “More protests will be organized in future
because this is just a beginning.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
