German two-year government note
yields climbed to the highest since December 2008 amid
speculation that reports this week will show rising commodity
prices are fueling inflation.  Benchmark 10-year yields rose above 3.5 percent for the
first time in 19 months. European data on April 15 is forecast
to confirm euro-area inflation accelerated to the fastest in
more than two years in March. Crude oil reached $127.02 per
barrel today, the highest since 2008. Greek debt was little
changed after  Germany  said the nation may need more support.  Oil prices  are “fostering inflation expectations and
driving rate-hike expectations, but might dampen longer-term
growth prospects,” said  Kornelius Purps , an interest-rate
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “It would be reasonable
to expect this form of curve movement, particularly in a week
where we are strongly focusing on inflation.”  The yield on the two-year note gained as much as four basis
points to 1.94 percent, the highest since Dec. 17, 2008, and was
at 1.91 percent at 4:32 p.m. in London. The 1.5 percent security
due March 2013 fell 0.01, or 10 euro cents per 1,000-euro
($1,446) face amount, to 99.24. The benchmark 10-year bund yield
breached 3.50 percent for the first time since Aug. 13, 2009.  Oil Surge  Brent oil for May settlement surged 6.7 percent last week
as unrest in  Libya  disrupted output and investors bought
commodities as a hedge against the declining dollar. The
contract was recently down 0.4 percent to $126.15.  France ’s three-year breakeven rate, a market gauge of
inflation expectation derived from yield difference between
nominal and index-linked bonds, climbed four basis points to
2.37 percentage points today.  French government debt was little changed after an auction
of 7.5 billion euros of 84-, 175- and 357-day bills today.  Germany sold 4 billion euros of six-month bills at an
average yield of 1.0884 percent, the Bundesbank said. It had a
maximum target of 5 billion euros.  The Greek 10-year yield was little changed at 12.86
percent. It earlier fluctuated after German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said it’s unclear whether  Greece  will need
another cut in its bailout rate or extension of repayment terms.
He spoke after a meeting of European Union finance ministers and
central bank chiefs on April 9 in Godollo,  Hungary .  Portuguese 10-year yields fell three basis points to 8.63
percent. A delegation from the EU to  Portugal  this week is
conducting a technical evaluation before negotiations on a
bailout begin. The EU set a mid-May deadline to arrange a three-
year lending program estimated at 80 billion euros.  Irish Rally  Irish government debt yields slid for a seventh day,
pushing the benchmark yield down eight basis points to 9.16
percent, as investor confidence in the nation rose following the
results of bank stress tests.  The difference in yield, or spread, between Irish 10-year
debt and equivalent German securities has narrowed about 120
basis points to 566 since Ireland’s central bank on March 31
told four lenders to raise 24 billion euros and announced plans
to merge two of them after the tests.  “This piece of new information was credible,” said Purps.
“The situation has now turned from an uncertain risk to a
certain risk, and having certainty alone was apparently worth
about 100 basis points of tightening.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
