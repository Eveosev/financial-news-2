South  Korea ’s won traded near a 31-
month high on speculation policy makers will favor currency
gains as a means of taming the fastest inflation in two years.
 Government bonds  declined.  The  Bank of Korea  is expected to leave its benchmark
interest rate at 3 percent tomorrow, according to 11 of 12
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One forecast borrowing costs
will be raised by a quarter of a percentage point for the fifth
time since mid-2010. Consumer prices climbed 4.7 percent from a
year earlier in March, the biggest increase since October 2008.  “There are expectations that the Bank of Korea will hold
rates unchanged and may let the won rise” to reduce import
prices, easing inflationary pressure, said Cho Young Bok, a
currency dealer at Daegu Bank in  Seoul . “Concern that
authorities will step in to slow the currency’s gain have been
keeping the won from rising too much.”  The won closed at 1,084.21 per dollar in Seoul, little
changed from 1,083.03 at the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,082.10 on April 8, the
strongest level since Sept. 8, 2008.  Foreign investors were net buyers of South Korean stocks
for an 18th straight day, building on some $4 billion of net
purchases in the past month, exchange data show. The benchmark
Kospi stock index closed within 0.4 percent of a record high
reached last week.  Government bonds dropped, with the yield on the 3 percent
note due December 2013 rising six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to a one-month high of 3.81 percent, according
to prices from Korea Stock Exchange. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Inflation may exceed the government’s 3 percent target this
year, Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said on April 8. The
government may revise its economic outlook for 2011 after first-
quarter data are released toward the end of this month, Yoon
told lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
