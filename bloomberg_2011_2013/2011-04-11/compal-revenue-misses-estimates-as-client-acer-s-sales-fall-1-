Compal Electronics Inc. (2324)  posted a 25
percent drop in first-quarter revenue, missing analyst estimates,
after customer  Acer Inc. (2353)  said sales won’t match its own forecast.  Revenue dropped to NT$164 billion ($5.7 billion) from
NT$220 billion a year earlier, the Taipei-based maker of  laptop
computers  said in a statement today. The average of four
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for revenue of
NT$198 billion. Shipments dropped 11 percent from the prior
quarter to 10.4 million units.  Acer, the world’s second-largest notebook vendor and one of
Compal’s largest customers, last month said it expects sales to
miss its earlier guidance because of weaker demand in the U.S.
and  Europe . Compal had originally forecast shipments to fall 5
percent from the prior quarter.  Compal, the world’s second-largest custom manufacturer of
notebooks, has fallen 23 percent this year to NT$29.95 at the
1:30 p.m. close today in Taipei. Larger rival Quanta Computer
Inc. has lost 13 percent, while the benchmark Taiex index has
declined 1 percent.  Acer forecast March 25 that revenue would decline about 10
percent from the prior three-month period after previously
expecting sales would climb. It was the second quarter in a row
the Taipei-based company lowered its sales outlook.  Quanta, based in Taoyuan,  Taiwan , on April 8 posted a 24
percent rise in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
