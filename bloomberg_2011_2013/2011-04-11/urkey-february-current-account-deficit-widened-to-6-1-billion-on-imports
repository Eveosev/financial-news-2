Turkey ’s current-account deficit
more than doubled in February from a year earlier, the 14th
consecutive widening in a measure the central bank says it’s
trying to contain.  The deficit rose to $6.1 billion from $2.7 billion in the
same month of 2010, the central bank in Ankara said on its
website today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of nine
economists was for a gap of $6.3 billion.  The cumulative deficit for the 12 months through February
was $54.8 billion, or about 7 percent of estimated gross
domestic product. The government’s medium-term plans forecast a
gap of $42.2 billion, or 5.4 percent of GDP.  Restraining the current-account gap is the bank’s main
policy priority, Erdem Basci, a deputy governor of the central
bank, said on March 29. The bank has cut  interest rates  by 75
basis points since December to help slow capital inflows, while
increasing  reserve requirements  to cap growth in loans. It had
forecast that those increases would take effect in the current
quarter of the year.  Net foreign direct investment was $497 million in February,
bringing the total for the year to $1 billion, compared with
$973 million in the same period of 2010, the bank said. Foreign
investors bought a net $1.8 billion in Turkish  government bonds 
in February and sold $554 million in shares, it said.  Exports rose 22 percent in February to $10.1 billion, while
imports surged 49 percent to $17.5 billion, the statistics
office said March 31.  The bank recorded $3.3 billion in inflows in the net errors
and omissions section of today’s data release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
