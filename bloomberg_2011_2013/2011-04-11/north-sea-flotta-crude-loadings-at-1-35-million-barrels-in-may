North Sea Flotta crude exports are
scheduled to fall to 1.35 million barrels next month from this
month’s 1.6 million barrels, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The May plan comprises one cargo of 700,000 barrels and
another of 650,000 barrels. That’s equivalent to 43,548 barrels
a day, compared with 53,333 barrels a day this month, the
program showed.  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  operates the field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
