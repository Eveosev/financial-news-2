China ’s economic growth will spur
gains for “upstream” commodity producers, consumer companies
and banks, according to Jing Ulrich, chairwoman of China
equities and commodities at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   “China will continue to lead the developing world and fuel
the need for raw materials,” Ulrich told reporters today in
Shanghai. “Commodities will be a bright spot for the
foreseeable future.”  China’s increasing dependence on commodity imports like
iron ore, coal, copper and oil will drive global demand, Ulrich
said. This will benefit natural resource producers in Australia
and Latin America, while the government’s plan to expand
spending in infrastructure and affordable housing will help
boost the earnings of cement producers including Anhui Conch
Cement Co.  Consumer companies such as Tingyi ( Cayman Islands ) Holding
Corp., China’s biggest maker of packaged food, will maintain
profit margins even as they face pressure from higher wage costs
given the outlook for consumption growth over the next five
years, Ulrich said. China’s lenders will benefit from higher net
interest margins as borrowing costs rise, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
