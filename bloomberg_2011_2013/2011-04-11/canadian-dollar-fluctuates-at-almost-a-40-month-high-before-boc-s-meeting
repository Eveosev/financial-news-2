Canada ’s dollar fluctuated at an
almost 40-month high reached last week against its U.S.
counterpart before the  Bank of Canada  meets tomorrow, when the
central bank is forecast to keep  interest rates  unchanged.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, erased its first
decline in five days against the U.S. dollar and has rallied 3.3
percent since March 15.  “It’s a wait and see right now ahead of the meeting
tomorrow,” said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency sales at
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New York. “The Canadian dollar
is at very strong levels and I don’t see anything that would
weaken it unless you see something extraordinary coming out of
the meeting.”  The loonie was little changed at 95.55 cents per  U.S.
dollar  at 12:42 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.54 on April 8, when the
currency touched 95.27 cents, the strongest level since Nov. 14,
2007. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0466.  The Bank of Canada, which led the Group of Seven nations
with three interest-rate increases last year, is expected to
keep its benchmark at 1 percent, according to the weighted
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 27 economists. The
central bank has kept its benchmark at 1 percent since
September.  Economic View  Policy makers reiterated on March 1 that “considerable
slack” remains in the economy. Exporters face “considerable
challenges” from a  currency trading  at a more than a three-year
high, they said.  The six-month overnight index swap rate, which is tied to
forecasts for the central bank’s policy rate, advanced to as
much as 1.1793 percent, compared with 1.0486 percent on March
16.  Other measures also show investors anticipating rate
increases in the second half of this year. Two-year Canadian
government bond yields gained seven basis points to as much as
1.927 percent last week. The premium investors demand to hold
the securities over the overnight rate is 91 basis points,
compared with an average of about 65 basis points since
September.  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year up four basis points, 0.04 percentage point,
to 3.48 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing
in June 2020 dropped 34 cents to C$100.13.  Oil Trend  Crude oil for May delivery fell 1.8 percent to $110.75 a
barrel in New York. It touched $113.46 a barrel, the highest
since September 2008. Gold for June delivery was down 0.5
percent to $1,467.40 an ounce earlier.  Raw materials , including oil and gold, account for about
half of Canada’s export revenue.  Futures traders increased their bets that the Canadian
dollar will gain against the U.S. dollar, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a drop - so-called net longs - was 65,030
on April 5, compared with net longs of 51,245 a week earlier.  “The Canadian dollar has given up a little bit of room
after testing the lower 95 levels,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director for foreign exchange trading at Bank of Montreal in
Toronto. “It’s a little bit of a wait and see because we have
nothing earth-shattering coming out economically before the Bank
of Canada release tomorrow.”  To contact the reporters for this story:
