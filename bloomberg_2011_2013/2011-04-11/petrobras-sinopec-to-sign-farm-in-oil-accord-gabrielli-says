China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) 
will team up with  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  to develop offshore
areas of the Para-Maranhao basin in northern Brazil after
negotiating for a year, Brazil’s state-run producer said.  Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli,
speaking to reporters in Beijing today, declined to give the
financial terms of the transaction. Last year, Petrobras
announced a preliminary agreement to sell stakes in two blocks,
 BM-PAMA-3 and BM-PAMA-4 , to Sinopec.  Sinopec is keen to expand its overseas oil and natural-gas
operations, Sinopec President Wang Tianpu said March 28.
Beijing-based Sinopec agreed last October to pay $7.1 billion
for a 40 percent stake in Repsol YPF SA’s exploration assets in
Brazil’s offshore Campos, Santos and Espirito Santos basins.  Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  is in China on an
official visit to boost trade and investment between the nations
and will meet with President Hu Jintao tomorrow. Petrobras is
investing $224 billion in the five years through 2014, the
largest spending plan of any oil company, to increase oil and
gasoline output.  To contact the reporters on this story:
