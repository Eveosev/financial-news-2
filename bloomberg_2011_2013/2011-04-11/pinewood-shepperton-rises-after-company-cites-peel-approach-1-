Pinewood Shepperton Plc (PWS) , the studio
where  James Bond  and Harry Potter films were made, rose as it
revealed that its biggest shareholder made an approach to buy
the company for 190 pence per share.  Peel Holdings Ltd., which is selling the Trafford Centre
near Manchester to  Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc (CSCG) , made the
approach, the Iver Heath, England-based studio said April 8
after the market closed in a statement on the Regulatory News
Service. Pinewood said it is 29.8 percent-owned by Peel. Shares
gained 4.6 percent today, and 12 percent before the April 8
announcement.  “This approach may or may not lead to an offer,” Pinewood
said in the statement on April 8.  Pinewood has applied for a permit to build homes for film
and television workers along with film sets designed to mimic
Amsterdam, Venice and  Manhattan . Project Pinewood, which needs
special approval because it would be built in a Green Belt
conservation area, may mean the company is worth more than Peel
is offering, analysts said.  Project Pinewood may mean the company is worth as much as
210 pence per share, Steve Liechti, an Investec Securities
analyst, wrote today. He has a “hold” recommendation on the
company. A Peel Hunt analyst, Malcolm Morgan, said Pinewood may
be worth 208 pence per share. His recommendation is under
review.  Pinewood,  Europe ’s largest provider of stage and studio
space, gained 8.5 pence to 194 pence. The shares have advanced
32 percent so far this year, giving the studio a market value of
89.7 million pounds ($147 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
