High market concentration caused
by the merger of wireless carriers doesn’t always result in
divestitures by companies such as  AT&T Inc. (T) , which is seeking
approval to buy  T-Mobile USA  for $39 billion.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the difference between the
number of markets flagged as insufficiently competitive by the
 Herfindahl-Hirschman Index  in previous wireless phone-service
mergers and the number of local markets where telecommunications
companies gave up operational units or wireless spectrum.  The Federal Communications Commission, charged with
reviewing whether telecommunication company mergers are in the
public interest, screens local markets. This screening, done
with either the Department of Justice or Federal Trade
Commission, identifies areas where a merger may harm consumers
or lessen competition. Disproportionate increases in the index
score draw scrutiny based on  merger guidelines  issued by the
U.S. government.  The scrutiny doesn’t necessarily result in merging
companies giving up large segments of their operations. When
Sprint Corp. purchased Nextel Communications in 2005, 190
cellular market areas were targeted by regulators who determined
the $41 billion deal did not significantly threaten competition.
The $46 billion merger between Dallas-based AT&T and New
Cingular Wireless Services Inc. raised red flags in 290 markets
for the FCC. Upon approval the company only divested from 29
markets.  In other cases, companies have preempted regulatory
demands. When  Verizon Wireless  merged with Alltel Corp. in 2008,
it voluntarily left 100 markets, almost half of the 218 reviewed
by regulators. The FCC and DOJ required the company to leave
only five additional markets to complete the deal.  Using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to score AT&T’s
proposed T-Mobile deal represents an initial step in the merger
review process. AT&T’s bid to become the largest U.S. wireless
carrier may result in high scores on the index, but the
commission will take a closer look at the impact of
consolidation on local markets, competitors, and other companies
before ruling on the deal.  (Edward Goodmann is a BGOV technology analyst.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
