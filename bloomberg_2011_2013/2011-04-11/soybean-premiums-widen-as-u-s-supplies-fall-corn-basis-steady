Cash premiums for soybeans shipped
in April to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as farmers withheld supplies after prices fell. The corn
basis was unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 58 cents to 62 cents a bushel above May futures,
compared with 58 cents to 60 cents on April 8, U.S. Department
of Agriculture  data  show. The corn basis for delivery in the
first half of April was unchanged at 56 cents to 57 cents a
bushel. Premiums rose for delivery in the second half of April
and the first half of May.  “Soybean exporters needed a few bushels, and farmers are
done selling until they see higher bids,” said Scott Stoller, a
merchandiser for Michlig Agricenter Inc. in Manlius,  Illinois .
“Corn exports are set to improve the next several weeks, so
there is a stronger bid developing for later delivery.”  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 23.75 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $13.685 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest decline for the contract since March 15. Corn futures
for May delivery rose 8 cents, or 1 percent, to $7.76 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
