Unemployment in the U.S. will
remain at an “unacceptable level” even as the nation’s economy
expands, former U.S. Treasury Secretary  Henry Paulson  said.  “We are going to see economic growth picking up, but
unemployment” will stay “at an unacceptable level for a number
of years,” Paulson said today in Hong Kong. “We are going to
make slow and steady growth, but we need to create more jobs.”  China should continue pursuing changes in its currency
system, said Paulson, who is now an adviser to Coda Automotive,
an electric-carmaker based in  Santa Monica , California. The
nation understands a more flexible currency can help manage
inflation, he said. He also said the relationship between China
and the U.S. is “healthy.”  Paulson, 65, was Treasury secretary from 2006 to 2009 under
then President George W. Bush. He proposed the $700 billion
Troubled Asset Relief Program to Congress after the Sept. 15,
2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which led to
capital injections in banks including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Bank of America Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
