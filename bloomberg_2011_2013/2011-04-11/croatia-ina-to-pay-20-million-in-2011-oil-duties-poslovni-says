INA  Industrija Nafte d.d., a
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt, will pay 105
million kuna ($20 million) in oil and gas concession duties this
year,  Poslovni Dnevnik  said, citing people it didn’t identify.  Croatia on March 25 raised concession duties on raw
minerals, including gas, oil and coal. The bill raised INA’s
duties on the value of extracted oil and gas to an estimated 5
percent this year, up from 3.1 percent in 2010, Poslovni said,
citing people close to the government.  Mol holds a 47.26 percent stake in INA Industrija Nafte
d.d., while the Croatian government owns 44.84 percent. INA is
the biggest investor and the fourth biggest employer in  Croatia ,
having invested about 17 billion kuna in the last decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
