Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz
cars and trucks, will expand its Car2go car-sharing unit to
Amsterdam with a fleet of 300 electric-powered Smart cars.  Amsterdam will start the service, which allows users to
rent vehicles by the minute, by the end of 2011, Stuttgart,
Germany-based Daimler said today in an e-mailed statement.  The expansion will mark the fourth city for Car2go and the
first with battery-powered versions of the two-seat Smart city
car. Amsterdam will install 300 public charging stations by the
end of this year, with another 1,000 planned for 2011, to
facilitate the introduction, Daimler said.  Auto manufacturers have been turning to car-sharing
services in a bid to attract young city dwellers, who see little
value in owning their own vehicle.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) â€™s
DriveNow, which will start renting BMW 1-Series and Mini models
in Munich this month, targets 1 million members by 2020. PSA
Peugeot Citroen offers subscription-based access to Peugeot
cars, vans, scooters and bicycles.  Car2go started renting Smarts in Hamburg last month after
testing the service in Austin,  Texas , and in Ulm in southern
 Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
