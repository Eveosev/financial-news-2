The French government raised
pressure for  Renault SA (RNO)  managers to resign over a botched
espionage investigation as the automaker’s directors gather for
an emergency board meeting.  Those responsible for mishandling Renault’s internal spy
probe “must depart,” Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said
on France Inter radio. The government is Renault’s biggest
shareholder, with a 15 percent stake.  Renault, which admitted last month it was hoaxed into
wrongfully firing three senior executives over espionage
accusations, will address the issue at a board meeting today,
company spokeswoman Caroline De Gezelle said by telephone,
declining further comment.  Upstream development chief Michel Balthazard and two other
executives were fired in January after a company investigation
incorrectly concluded they had received payments from Chinese
companies via foreign accounts. Renault security manager
Dominique Gevrey, who obtained more than 300,000 euros
($434,000) from the carmaker to pay an anonymous source for the
information, was arrested on fraud charges after the espionage
claims unraveled.  A board-level inquiry into the affair has found “serious
dysfunction within the company’s management,” Industry Minister
Eric Besson said today on LCI television. Those responsible
“are named in the report, but it’s not for me to identify
them,” he said.  Renault will issue a statement after the conclusion of the
board meeting, spokeswoman De Gezelle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
