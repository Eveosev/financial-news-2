SSAB AB (SSABA) ,  Sweden ’s biggest
steelmaker, plans to establish a network of service centers in
 Asia , as it seeks to sell more specialty materials to companies
in the region that manufacture cranes, trucks and heavy
excavators, the Financial Times reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Martin Lindqvist.  The company aims to double its Asian sales of products such
as high-strength steels in the next five years, the newspaper
