Shares in INA Industrija Nafte
d.d., a Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt, fell
10 percent after trading was resumed today following a two-week
suspension.  INA’s stock price closed at 3,604 kuna per share, after
opening at 4,011 kuna per share today at Zagreb stock exchange.
 Croatia ’s market regulator on March 28 suspended trading in INA
shares, saying it acted “following significant trading by
foreign investors” and to protect INA’s shareholders.  The sudden drop triggered an automatic suspension in early
trading, which was quickly removed after INA said in a statement
to the bourse there was nothing suspicious about the trade.  Mol holds a 47.26 percent stake in INA Industrija nafte
d.d., while the Croatian government owns 44.84 percent. INA is
the biggest investor and the fourth biggest employer in Croatia,
having invested about 17 billion kuna in the last decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
