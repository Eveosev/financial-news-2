JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  collected
almost $1.9 billion from collateral it obtained on lending to
the London-based investment vehicle Sigma while clients lost
almost all the $500 million they invested with the fund, the New
York Times reported, citing court documents.  Joseph Evangelisti , a spokesman for JPMorgan, rejected the
accusations and said the bank lent Sigma more than $8 billion to
help it survive and did its best to protect its clients, the
newspaper reported.  The suit claims that JPMorgan employees planned to profit
from a collapse of Sigma even as employees in another of the
bank’s unit left their customers’ money invested, the Times
reported.  Many of the assets JPMorgan received as a security depost
for its loans to Sigma appreciated in value and provided the
bank with a large profit, the newspaper reported, citing the
suit.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
