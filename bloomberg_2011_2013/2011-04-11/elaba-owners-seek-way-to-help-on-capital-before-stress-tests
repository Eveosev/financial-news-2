Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen,
 Germany ’s fifth-biggest state-owned lender, and Hesse Economy
Minister Dieter Posch said the bank’s owners may seek an
agreement that would help it pass European stress tests.  The regional savings-bank association and the states of
Hesse and Thuringia plan to discuss options for converting so-
called silent participations so that they would count as core
capital in the stress tests, Posch told reporters today. If the
lender’s owners publicly disclose and commit to plans to convert
the hybrid capital by the end of April, the  European Banking
Authority  may count it as core capital, said Helaba Chief
Executive Officer Hans-Dieter Brenner.  German state lenders such as Helaba and Norddeutsche
Landesbank are rushing to strengthen the quality of their
capital after the EBA last week said it will use a tougher
measure of capital on 90 lenders. Banks are expected to maintain
a core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, of
at least 5 percent to pass the exam, the result of which is
scheduled to be published in June.  “The owners stand behind the bank and will do everything
possible to put Helaba in the position it had before” the EBA
announced a more stringent capital definition, Brenner said on
the sidelines of a press conference in  Frankfurt  today. “I’m
assuming we have enough time before April 30.”  Helaba had a core Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.6 percent at
the end of March under current laws, Brenner said. At Helaba,
silent participations -- the funds the state-owned banks receive
from savings banks and regional governments -- accounted for
more than 50 percent of the total in 2010, meaning Helaba would
fail if it wasn’t counted as core capital.  Helaba Owners  The Frankfurt-based lender, which didn’t need government
aid during the financial crisis, has “absolutely no fears”
about passing the stress scenarios on its assets, such as an
economic contraction, a drop in equity markets and losses on
bond holdings, he said. The definition of capital is the only
issue, according to Brenner.  The state of Hesse owns 10 percent of Helaba, while
Thuringia has 5 percent and the remainder is held by the
regional savings-bank association, known as SGVHT. A spokesman
for the association couldn’t be immediately reached for comment
by Bloomberg News.  In the stress tests, only silent participations provided by
Germany’s Soffin bank-rescue fund or regional states as aid
during the financial crisis will count as core capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
