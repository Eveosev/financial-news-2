Philippine three-year bonds dropped,
pushing yields to a one-week high, as higher  oil prices 
threatened to fan inflation.  Crude surged 4.5 percent to $112.79 a barrel last week in
 New York , before retreating 0.4 percent today. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas may raise borrowing costs again this year because of
inflation risks from higher commodity prices, Governor Amando Tetangco said in a Bloomberg TV interview today from Beijing. A
stronger peso helps damp inflationary pressures, he said.  “There are inflation worries going forward and we still
expect the central bank to raise  interest rates  at their next
policy meeting,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president
and treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “The
strengthening of the peso should help temper some inflation
pressure.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 climbed
25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to close at 5 percent
in  Manila , according to Amstel Financial Services.  Consumer prices rose 4.3 percent from a year earlier in
each of the last two months, the biggest gains since May 2010.
Inflation this year may average closer to the top end of the
central bank’s target range of 3 percent to 5 percent, Tetangco
said. The monetary authority raised its benchmark rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on March 24, the
first increase since August 2008.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 43.083 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency has strengthened
1.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
