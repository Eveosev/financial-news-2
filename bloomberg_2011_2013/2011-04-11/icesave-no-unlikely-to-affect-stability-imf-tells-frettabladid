Icelanders rejection of an accord
on depositors with the U.K. and the Netherlands is unlikely to
“jeopardize economical or financial stability,” said Franek Rozwadowski, the International Monetary Fund’s resident
representative, according to Frettabladid.  The IMF will re-evaluate Iceland’s economic program
following the rejection, he told  Frettabladid . The impact
“depends on the reaction of investors,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
