Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) 
anticipates sales growing in China this year at a “double-
digit” percentage rate, although lower than last year’s
increase,  Ian Robertson , the luxury carmaker’s sales chief, said
today in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Demand in China
is being driven by the full-sized 7-Series and extended version
of the 5-Series, he said.  The carmaker will likely avoid production disruptions
related to last month’s earthquake in Japan for at least the
coming weeks, Robertson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
