Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said he plans next week to visit Italy, France and
Qatar, the three nations that have recognized the Interim
Transitional National Council as the legitimate government of
the North African nation.  He indicated the schedule may change depending on the state
of the fighting. “If things improve, I will visit the three
countries that recognized us,” he said today at a press
conference in Benghazi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
