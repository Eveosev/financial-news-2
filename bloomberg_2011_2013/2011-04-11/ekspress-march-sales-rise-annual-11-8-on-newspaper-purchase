AS Ekspress Grupp, the only
publicly traded Baltic media company, said sales increased 11.8
percent in March from a year earlier after the acquisition of a
50 percent stake in newspaper publisher Eesti Paeevalehe AS last
month.  Sales growth, normalized at Ekspress Gruppâ€™s former 50
percent shareholding, was 6.8 percent, the Tallinn-based company
said in a regulatory statement today. Sales on Internet portal
Delfi Estonia rose by about 30 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
