Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, reported first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates after prices rose for the lightweight metal.  Net income of $308 million, or 27 cents a share, compares
with a loss of $201 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier, New
York-based Alcoa said today in a statement. Earnings excluding
restructuring costs and other one-time items were 28 cents a
share, topping the 27-cent average estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased 22 percent to $5.96
billion.  The adjusted profit is the biggest since the company earned
37 cents a share in the third quarter of 2008, when commodity
prices tumbled amid the global financial crisis. Aluminum prices
have advanced in the past year in  London  because of improving
demand for the metal, which is used in construction, autos and
beverage cans.  “The commodity price has done better than I think most
assumed,” Lloyd O’Carroll, a Richmond, Virginia-based analyst
at Davenport & Co., said in a telephone interview before the
earnings were released.  Aluminum on the LME averaged $2,531 a metric ton in the
first quarter, 15 percent more than a year earlier and the most
since the third period of 2008.  Alcoa, traditionally the first company in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  to report quarterly earnings, posted first-
quarter sales of $4.89 billion a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
