Colombia ’s peso held near a six-
month high amid an increase in portfolio and foreign direct
investment flows into the South American nation.  The currency was little changed at 1,817.35 per  U.S. dollar 
at 3:43 p.m. New York time. The peso has advanced 2.9 percent in
the past month, the second-best performance after the Brazilian
real among six Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “We’re seeing strong FDI, mainly from oil and mining, and
portfolio investment is also growing,” said Juan Camilo Santana, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Cia. de
Profesionales de Bolsa SA.  Foreign direct investment rose to $3.09 billion in the year
through March 25, with 87 percent going into oil and mining,
according to the central bank. That compares to $2.17 billion in
the first three months of 2010.  The government will likely take additional steps to stem
gains in the peso -- including imposing  capital controls  or
increasing dollar purchases by the central bank -- should the
currency gain beyond 1,800, according to Santana.  Banco de la Republica in February extended a plan to buy a
minimum of $20 million daily in the local market until “at
least” June 17.  Colombia would consider imposing capital controls should
the central bank see “excessive” short-term borrowing from
abroad, bank co-director Carlos Gustavo Cano said last week.
That isn’t currently the case, he said.  The yield on the benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020
fell 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.13 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.198 centavo to 118.121 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
