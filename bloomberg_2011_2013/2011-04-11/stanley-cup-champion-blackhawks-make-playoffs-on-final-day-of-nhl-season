The defending Stanley Cup champion
 Chicago  Blackhawks made it into the playoffs on the final day of
the National Hockey League’s regular season.  Although the Blackhawks lost to the Detroit Red Wings 4-3
yesterday, they clinched the Western Conference’s final
postseason berth when the Minnesota Wild beat the Dallas Stars
5-3. Dallas finished two points behind Chicago in the West and
could have overtaken the defending champions with a win.  Chicago will open the playoffs against the top-seeded
Vancouver Canucks in a best-of-seven first-round series that
starts April 13 in Vancouver.  The Washington Capitals are the top seed in the Eastern
Conference and play the  New York Rangers  in the opening round,
with Game 1 scheduled for April 13.  Philadelphia meets Buffalo,  Boston  faces Montreal and
Pittsburgh plays Tampa Bay in the Eastern Conference’s other
first-round matchups. Elsewhere in the West, it’s San Jose
against the Los Angeles Kings, Detroit versus Phoenix and
Anaheim against Nashville.  To contact the reporter on this story:
