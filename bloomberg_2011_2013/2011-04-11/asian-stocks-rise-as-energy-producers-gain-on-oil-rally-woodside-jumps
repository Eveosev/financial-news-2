Most Asian stocks dropped as a
rally in crude oil prices sparked concern high energy costs will
slow the economic recovery. Futures on the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average in  Singapore  declined as a strong earthquake shook
buildings in Tokyo after most markets had closed.  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) , Australia’s biggest carrier, and
Korean Air Lines Co. dropped at least 2.6 percent.  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker, and rival Honda Motor Co.
fell at least 2.2 percent after Citigroup Inc. downgraded the
Japanese automotive sector.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, climbed 3.8 percent after copper futures
advanced for a fifth day and as it doused speculation it may buy
Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s stake in  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)   “The market seems to be ignoring a lot of risks,” said
Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-based fund manager at Schroders Plc,
which manages about $308 billion. “Over the longer term, higher
 oil prices  are not good for the economy. The fact that the
market is ignoring that along with  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis and growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and
North Africa suggests that investors are too complacent.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at 136.49 as
of 7:48 p.m. in Tokyo, after swinging between gains and losses
more than 15 times. About seven stocks fell for every four that
rose in the index. The gauge has risen for three straight weeks
as Japanese companies resumed production after last month’s
earthquake, and as an improving U.S. economy bolstered optimism
the global recovery can be sustained.  Japan  Aftershock  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.5 percent as the
nation’s machinery orders dropped for the first time in three
months in February, before the March 11 earthquake and a tsunami
devastated the country’s northeastern region. Futures on Nikkei
225 dropped as much as 1.2 percent in Singapore when a 7.1
magnitude aftershock struck the country’s Tohoku region. Prime
Minister Naoto Kan said the government is checking if the
temblor caused any further damage to the crippled Fukushima Dai-
Ichi nuclear plants.  “The earthquake in Japan is not the issue because we’ve
been having these kinds of earthquakes in the last week and
there may be more,” said  Steven Leung , director of
institutional sales in UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. in  Hong Kong .
“The focus is on the economic data in  China .”  China’s Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.2 percent as
speculation gains in property and automotive sales will slow
this year overshadowed a report showing faster-than-expected
growth in exports. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sank 0.4 percent.
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.6 percent and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index climbed 0.5 percent.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
today. In  New York , the index dropped 0.4 percent to 1,328.17 on
April 8 as oil’s rally to a 30-month high drove down
transportation shares and investors speculated a fight in the
U.S. Congress over the federal budget may shut the government
for the first time since 1996.  Airlines fell after crude oil for May delivery rose 2.3
percent to $112.79 a barrel in New York on April 8, the highest
settlement since Sept. 22, 2008. Oil was little changed at
$112.74 as of 1:10 p.m.  Tokyo  time, erasing earlier gains of as
much as 0.6 percent, after reports Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi
has accepted a cease-fire with rebels, easing concerns about
further unrest disrupting supplies from the country.  Qantas, Korean Air  Qantas slipped 3.2 percent to A$2.12 in Sydney. Korean Air
Lines sank 2.6 percent to 63,100 won in  Seoul . Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd., Hong Kong’s biggest carrier, lost 0.5 percent to
HK$19.38.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  fell 0.4 percent to S$13.58.  Japanese car makers dropped after Citigroup downgraded the
sector to “sell” from “buy,” saying investors have yet to
price in the impact on earnings of last month’s earthquake.  Toyota dropped 2.4 percent to 3,260 yen. Honda Motor slid
2.2 percent to 2,903 yen. Nissan Motor Co. fell 2.4 percent to
697 yen.  Also in Tokyo,  Sony Corp. (6758) , the world’s largest exporter of
consumer electronics, lost 1.5 percent to 2,576 yen. The company
cut European prices for its PlayStation Portable video-game
player by 24 percent, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. said in a
statement on its website.  Mining companies advanced as three-month-delivery copper on
the London Metal Exchange climbed as much as 0.70 percent to
$9,944 per metric ton, and was at $9,832.75 at 5:20 p.m. Tokyo
time. Imports of copper and products by China rose 29 percent in
March to 304,299 tons, climbing from a two-year low of 235,469
tons in February, according to customs data issued yesterday.  BHP, Woodside  BHP rose 3.8 percent to A$49.55 in Sydney. Rio Tinto Group,
the world’s second-biggest mining company, increased 2.4 percent
to A$88.30.  Energy producers also advanced, with Inpex Corp., Japan’s
biggest energy explorer, climbing 3 percent to 654,000 yen.
Santos Ltd., Australia’s No 3. oil and gas producer, increased
1.3 percent to A$16.49.  Woodside Petroleum gained 1.9 percent to A$48.16 in Sydney,
paring an advance of as much as 7.6 percent. The stock trimmed
gains after BHP said it isn’t aware of any basis for media
reports linking it to Australia’s second-largest energy producer.
The Sunday Times reported yesterday that BHP is in talks with
Shell, which holds a 24 percent stake in Woodside.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.8 percent this year
through April 8, compared with gains of 5.6 percent by the  S&P
500  and 2.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
