Ivory Coast’s  defaulted Eurobonds
jumped as former leader  Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to step down
after losing November elections, was captured by forces loyal to
Alassane Ouattara.  The $2.3 billion bonds due 2032 of the world’s biggest
cocoa producer rose as much 0.4 percent to 53.083 cents on the
dollar as of 3:31 p.m. in  London , according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  Forces loyal to president-elect Ouattara captured Gbagbo,
Ali Coulibally, the country’s Ambassador to  France , and
Apollinaire Yapi, a spokesman for Ouattara, said today.  “The bonds should naturally rally several percentage
points today, but beyond that it’s still going to be tough for
Ouattara going forwards,” Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, the managing
director of New York-based DaMina Advisors LLP, said in a phone
interview from Accra today. “Long-term, the Ivorian economy
should be able to survive, in the short-term it will have
serious challenges. It’s not so easy to go from a country that
has been in a mini-civil war to a normal country overnight.”  Ivory Coast  failed to make a $29 million interest payment
due at the end of January as Ouattara, internationally
recognized as victor of the elections, was locked in a political
standoff with Gbagbo, who refusal to step down triggered a civil
war. Rebel forces backing Ouattara swept south in the past month
before entering Abidjan, the commercial capital on March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
