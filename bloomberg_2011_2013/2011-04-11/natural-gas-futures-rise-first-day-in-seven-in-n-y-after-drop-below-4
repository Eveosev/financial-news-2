Natural gas futures rose in  New
York , rebounding from the first drop below $4 in three weeks, as
traders bought back contracts sold during six days of declines.  Gas gained 1.7 percent after falling to $3.99 per million
British thermal units, the lowest intraday price since March 17.
It had declined as warmer-than-normal weather cut demand for the
heating and power-plant fuel.  “We came down a lot in the last six days and this rally is
alleviating the oversold condition,” said  Kyle Cooper , director
of research for IAF Advisors in Houston. “It’s the first time
in a while we hit $4 support.”  Natural gas for May delivery gained 6.7 cents to settle at
$4.108 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have dropped 6.7 percent this
year. The contract’s 7.4 percent drop last week was the biggest
weekly decline since the five days ended Feb. 11.  “The fact that it fell briefly below $4 has got a few
shorts a little nervous and they are saying, ‘Hey, it’s not
going down anymore and let’s cover,’” Cooper said. Traders who
sold gas contracts last week are buying them back, he said.  Temperatures will be below normal from April 16 to April
20, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  The high in New York on April 18 will be 56 degrees
Fahrenheit (13 Celsius), 6 degrees below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in
 Chicago  may be 57 degrees, 3 lower than normal.  Low-Demand Season  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  “As we enter the low-demand shoulder season, the market
will be under pressure,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant
at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta.  The number of gas drilling rigs in the U.S. fell 2 to 889
last week, according to Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. The rig
count was 7.3 percent lower than a year earlier.  Funds and other large investors increased their gas buying
positions on the Nymex in the seven days ended April 5,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly
Commitments of Traders report.  Net-long positions in natural gas held by what the CFTC
characterizes as managed money, including  hedge funds , commodity
pools and commodity-trading advisers, increased by 27,061
futures equivalents to 104,046 in the week ended April 5.  Supply Report  U.S. gas stockpiles declined 45 billion cubic feet in the
week ended April 1 to 1.579 trillion cubic feet, the Energy
Department reported last week. Supplies were 0.6 percent above
the five-year average, down from a 4.4 percent surplus the
previous week.  The department will release its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook tomorrow. The report will estimate gas production and
prices for 2011 and 2012.  Last month, the department said marketed gas production
will average 62.29 billion cubic feet a day this year, up from
last year’s 61.82 billion.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
310,030 as of 2:40 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 322,000. Volume was 386,536 on April 8. Open interest was
942,484 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
902,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
