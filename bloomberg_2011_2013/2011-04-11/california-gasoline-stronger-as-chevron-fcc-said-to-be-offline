California gasoline prices rose as
a unit at Chevron Corp.’s El Segundo refinery was said to be
shut for unplanned maintenance.  The gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracker is down at the
279,000-barrel-a-day Chevron plant, according to Bob van der Valk, a fuel pricing analyst at 4Refuel Inc., a Canadian fuel-
management company. “West Coast traders are saying it will be
down for a week,” he said in an e-mail.  “We generally do not discuss any details about the day-to-
day operations of the refinery,” said Rod Spackman, a spokesman
for the plant. “This ongoing work has no impact on our ability
to deliver products to our customers here in the Southern
California region.”  The premium for California-blend gasoline in  Los Angeles 
rose 3.75 cents to 17.25 cents versus futures traded on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange in New York at 2:17 p.m. Prompt
delivery fell 1.46 cents to $3.3811 a gallon.  The differential for the same fuel in  San Francisco  rose
3.50 cents to 12.75 cents a gallon over futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
