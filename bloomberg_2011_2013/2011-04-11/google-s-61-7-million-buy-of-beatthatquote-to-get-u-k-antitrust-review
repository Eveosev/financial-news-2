Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s 37.7 million-pound
($61.8 million) acquisition of U.K. price-comparison website
 BeatThatQuote.com  will get a preliminary review by Britain’s
antitrust regulator.  The purchase of the London-based company, which compares
the costs of loans, insurance and utilities, will be examined to
see if it creates a “relevant merger situation,” the U.K.
 Office of Fair Trading  said today in a statement.  If the transaction announced March 7 qualifies, the
watchdog will “consider whether the creation of that situation
may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of
competition,” the OFT said.  Google last week won U.S. regulatory approval of its $700
million purchase of ITA Software Inc. on condition it share
travel data with rivals. The European Union’s antitrust watchdog
is also probing whether  Mountain View , California-based Google
is skewing its search results to favor its own businesses.  The operator of the world’s most-popular search engine told
the London-based regulator that “BeatThatQuote.com’s expertise
combined with Google’s technology will spur innovations that
save U.K. consumers time and money,” Google spokesman Stephen
Rosenthal said in an e-mail.  An e-mail to BeatThatQuote.com through its website didn’t
immediately receive a response.  To contact the reporter on this story:
