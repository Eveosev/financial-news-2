German Chancellor  Angela Merkel â€™s
coalition has drawn up a six-point plan to help the country meet
its power needs should the government opt for a speedier exit
from nuclear energy, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  The proposals, which Merkel will discuss with state prime
ministers on April 15, include plans to build off-shore wind
parks and subsidize energy-efficient building, the newspaper
said, citing a government document.  Merkel would face financial problems in pushing the plan
because she has counted on revenue from nuclear power companies
to help  Germany  develop renewable power, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
