U.K. banks must increase their
capital reserves in order to protect savers and taxpayers from
another financial crisis, the Independent Commission on Banking
is expected to say later today, the  Daily Telegraph  reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  The ICB, created by the current Conservative-Liberal
Democrat coalition government, will present its interim report
on the banks’ role in the financial crisis later today.  Banks are to be told they should raise the present capital
investment level to 10 pounds of shareholder equity for every
100 pounds ($137) they lend, with another 2 pounds per 100
pounds lent for banks deemed “too big to fail,” the Telegraph
said.  Credit Suisse estimates the new rules will mean the
country’s biggest banks having to raise 15 billion pounds over
the next two years to meet the criteria, the newspaper added.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
