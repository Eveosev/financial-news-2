Russian billionaire  Alisher Usmanov , who owns a 27 percent stake in Arsenal soccer club, has
made two offers to buy Nina Bracewell Smithâ€™s 16 percent stake
in the club for just under 130 million pounds ($212.5 million)
Sky News City Editor Mark Kleinman reported, citing a person
close to Usmanov.  Bracewell-Smith rejected the offers partly because she had
already agreed to sell her stake to Stan Kroenke, who has
boosted his stake in the club to 62 percent, and partly because
the American has already forged a relationship with the Arsenal
board, Kleinman said, without attribution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
