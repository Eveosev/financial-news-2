Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co., maker
of an estimated 90 percent of the world’s copper foil used in
smartphones, said it resumed production today after last month’s
natural disaster in  Japan  disrupted output.  Manufacturing will be at normal levels as long as there are
no further electricity outages by Tokyo Electric Power Co.,
spokesman Takayasu Ogisu said by phone today. Tokyo-based Mitsui
Mining, also Japan’s largest zinc smelter, produces 4,250 tons
of copper foil a month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
