Kim Clijsters , who won the last two
Grand Slam singles tennis championships, may miss next month’s
 French Open  after injuring her ankle at a cousin’s wedding.  Clijsters, a two-time French Open runner-up from Belgium,
was already facing four weeks on the sideline because of
shoulder and wrist injuries. The ankle will need at least 4-6
weeks of recovery time, according to a statement posted
yesterday on Clijsters’s  website .  “Since the French Open starts in literally six weeks,
Kim’s presence in Paris is very uncertain,” the statement said.
“In the meantime Kim has to continue working on her recovery of
a shoulder and wrist injury.”  The statement didn’t provide any details on how Clijsters
injured her ankle. It said she tore and strained ligaments, and
that “the consequences are rather dire.”  Clijsters, 27, won the  U.S. Open  in September and captured
her fourth Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.
She’s No. 2 in the women’s tennis rankings.  The French Open, which starts May 22 in Paris, is already
without 13-time Grand Slam champion  Serena Williams , who has
been off the court since July after cutting her foot on a shard
of glass in Germany. Williams has had two operations on her foot
and last month was treated for a blood clot in her lung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
