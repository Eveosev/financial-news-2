Bahrain Petroleum Co. is ramping up
production at the kingdomâ€™s only refinery after shutting some
units for maintenance, according to a company official.  Production at the 267,000 barrel-a-day plant will likely
return to full capacity today as a hydrocracker resumes
operation, said the official, who asked not to be identified in
line with company policy.  The state-owned refinery halted the hydrocracker, used to
produce distillates including diesel and jet fuel, as part of a
scheduled maintenance program starting in February, the company
had said.  The maintenance work continued amid violent clashes in the
island nation that led the government to impose a state of
emergency and curfew. Middle East states are being shaken by
anti-government protests that have spread from Tunisia and  Egypt 
over the last three months. Demonstrators in states including
Bahrain and Oman have demanded more political representation,
better pay and improved employment prospects.  The refiner planned to perform work on its low-sulfur
diesel plant, shutting a hydrocracker, a hydrogen plant, a
sulfur-recovery unit and flare, and units for crude, gas
recovery and vacuum distillation, according to the January
statement.  Refineries generally stagger maintenance, shutting some
units at one time and leaving work on others for later. Bapco,
as the company is known, may shut its other major units,
including a crude facility and diesel plant, in 2013, the
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
