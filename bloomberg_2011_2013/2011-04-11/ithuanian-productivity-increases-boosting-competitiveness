Lithuanian productivity expanded
last year, after contracting in 2009, helping boost the Baltic
nationâ€™s competitiveness as wages fall.  Productivity per hour worked increased 5.7 percent,
compared with a 6.4 percent contraction in 2009, the Vilnius-
based statistics  office  said today in an e-mailed statement.
Average wages fell 3.2 percent last year.  Growth in productivity exceeded wage growth for the first
time since  Lithuania  joined the European Union in 2004, when
 living standards  rose toward those in Western Europe. The
turnaround is helping Lithuania restore competitiveness lost in
the boom years from 2004 through 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
