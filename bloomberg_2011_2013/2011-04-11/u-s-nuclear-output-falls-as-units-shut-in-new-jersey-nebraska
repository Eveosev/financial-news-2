U.S. nuclear-power output fell 0.4
percent as reactors shut in  New Jersey  and Nebraska, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide decreased 322 megawatts from
April 8 to 75,969 megawatts, or 75 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-four of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  shut the 1,130-
megawatt Salem 2 reactor located about 18 miles (29 kilometers)
south of Wilmington,  Delaware . It was operating at 95 percent of
capacity on April 8. Another unit at the site, the 1,174-
megawatt Salem 1, is operating at full power.  Omaha Public Power District idled the 482-megawatt Fort
Calhoun reactor located on the Missouri River, 19 miles north of
Omaha. It was operating at full capacity on April 8, the
commission said.  Southern Co. (SO)  slowed the 860-megawatt Farley 2 reactor in
 Alabama  to 56 percent of capacity from 100 percent on April 8.
Another unit at the site, the 851-megawatt Farley 1, is
operating at full power. The plant is located about 18 miles
east of Dothan.  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  started the 940-megawatt Beaver Valley 2
reactor in Shippingport,  Pennsylvania . It is operating at 25
percent of capacity.  Water Leak  While the unit was at 15 percent of capacity on April 9,
the “A” auxiliary feedwater injection header was declared
inoperable due to a water leak and the reactor was put in hot
standby mode, meaning it was at operating pressure and
temperature, the NRC said.  At about 4 a.m. local time yesterday, the unit was manually
tripped offline because of a build-up of steam in one of its
generators, the federal agency said.  The plant is located about 26 miles northwest of
Pittsburgh. Another 940-megawatt unit at the site, Beaver Valley
1, is operating at 82 percent of capacity.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  started the 1,025-megawatt Indian Point 3
located on the Hudson River about 27 miles north of  New York
City . It is operating at 86 percent of capacity. The 1,020-
megawatt Indian Point 2 reactor is operating at full capacity.
Unit 1 was shut in 1974.  The Tennessee Valley Authority boosted output from the
1,104-megawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor in Alabama to 68 percent
of capacity from 19 percent on April 8.  TVA Reactor  Browns Ferry Units 1 and 3, which have respective
capacities of 1,065 megawatts and 1,115 megawatts, are operating
at full power. The plant is located 84 miles north of Birmingham
on Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee border.  FirstEnergy slowed the 893-megawatt Davis-Besse reactor to
91 percent of capacity from 100 percent on April 8. The unit is
located on Lake Erie 21 miles east of Toledo,  Ohio .  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
