Crescent Petroleum Co., the biggest
shareholder in  Dana Gas PJSC (DANA) , hasn’t reached an agreement with
 Iran  on natural-gas prices for exports to the United Arab
Emirates, according to  Mehr .  No agreement has been reached between the two parties and
the contract is in international arbitration, the state-run  news
agency  said, citing Hamid Zaheri, Crescent’s general manager in
Tehran.  Iran and the U.A.E. agreed on pricing for exports of
Iranian natural gas, the state-run Fars news agency reported
yesterday, citing an unidentified official. Gas will be
transferred from Iran’s Salman field to the U.A.E. at a price
five times higher than that of gas from nearby Qatar, said the
official, whom Fars described as familiar with the talks.  Fars said the agreement seemed to refer to a long-delayed
contract between Crescent Petroleum and the National Iranian Oil
Co. for gas exports from southern Iran. The two sides reached an
agreement in 2001, with deliveries originally scheduled to start
in 2005. Iran later raised the price it had proposed, blaming a
sharp increase in international  gas prices , Fars said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
