El Sewedy Electric Co., an Egyptian
maker of cables, said its  Qatar  unit Doha Cables won a $440-
million contract from the Qatar General Electricity & Water
Corp., also known as  Kahramaa .  Doha Cables, which is 46 percent-owned by El Sewedy and
controlled by the Egyptian company, will supply Kahramaa with
42,000 tons of copper cables in the next two years, El Sewedy
said in an e-mailed statement today. The company was one of 12
bidders for the project.  “This is definitely positive for Sewedy as it secures
about 8 percent of their 2010 volume from Qatar,” said Allen Sandeep, equity analyst at Cairo-based Beltone Financial. “It
will reduce the pain of lost revenue from  Libya , but it is
unclear just how much yet.”  El Sewedy expects little revenue growth this year because
of political unrest in Egypt and Libya, Ahmed El Homosani, head
of  investor relations , said March 21. The company’s 2010 profit
rose 30 percent to 816.6 million Egyptian pounds ($137 million)
from the year earlier.  Shares of El Sewedy lost 0.2 percent to 40.73 pounds at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, valuing the company at 6.99 billion
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
