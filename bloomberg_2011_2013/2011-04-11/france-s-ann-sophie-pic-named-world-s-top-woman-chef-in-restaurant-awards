The  World’s 50 Best Restaurants 
awards today named Ann-Sophie Pic, of Maison Pic in Valence,
 France , as the Best Female Chef for 2011, beating Nadia Santini
of Dal Pescatore,  Italy , and Elena Arzak of Arzak, in  Spain .  Pic, 41, made headlines in 2007 when she became the fourth
woman in history to hold three Michelin stars, for the
restaurant that she took over from her father and grandfather.
She studied in the U.S. and  Japan  before heading the kitchen.  The Veuve Clicquot World’s Best Female Chef is a new award
this year, the organizers said in an e-mailed statement. It was
voted for by the 837 voters of the Electrolux World’s 50 Best
Restaurants Academy, of which I am a member.  When the new female chef award category was announced
earlier this year, some women writers denounced it on Twitter as
patronizing.  Juan Mari Arzak, 68, also of Arzak, wins the “Lifetime
Achievement” accolade, which will be presented at the San
Pellegrino World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards at the Guildhall
in  London  on April 18. The winner of the World’s Best Restaurant
title will be announced that night, with last year’s winner
Noma, of Copenhagen, a favorite to take the top prize.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
