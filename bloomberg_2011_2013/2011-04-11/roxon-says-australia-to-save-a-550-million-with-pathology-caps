Australia will save A$550 million
($581 million) under an agreement that will cap medical testing
from companies such as  Primary Health Care Ltd. (PRY)  and  Sonic
Healthcare Ltd. (SHL) , Health Minister Nicola Roxon said.  The government will limit annual rises at 5 percent in
pathology from the current yearly average of 7.3 percent for the
public health system, known as Medicare, Roxon said today. A
Pathology Agreement Advisory committee will make sure the
ceiling is adhered to, she said.  “This will help the sector to be prepared for the
challenges of the future, including pressures from our aging
population and increased rates of preventable disease,” Roxon
said in an e-mailed statement.  Government spending  on pathology has grown by an average of
7.3 percent a year since 1984 to A$2 billion, Roxon said. The
A$550 million in savings apply to the five years from the July 1
start of the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
