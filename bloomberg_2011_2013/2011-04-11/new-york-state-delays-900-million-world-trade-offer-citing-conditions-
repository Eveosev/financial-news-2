New York state’s Liberty

bonds to finance the 4 World Trade Center project, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said.  The issue was postponed “due to market considerations,”
according to a statement released today.  A separate $375 million floating-rate offering is also
being delayed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
