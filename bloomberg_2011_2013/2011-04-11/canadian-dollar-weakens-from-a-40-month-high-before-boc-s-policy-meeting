Canada ’s dollar fluctuated at
almost a 40-month high against its U.S. counterpart before the
 Bank of Canada  meets tomorrow, when the central bank is forecast
to keep  interest rates  unchanged.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, slipped for the
first day in five against the dollar after rallying 3 percent
since March 15.  “The Canadian dollar has given up a little bit of room
after testing the lower 95 levels,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director for foreign exchange trading at Bank of Montreal in
Toronto. “It’s a little bit of a wait and see because we have
nothing earth-shattering coming out economically before the Bank
of Canada release tomorrow.”  The loonie weakened 0.1 percent to 95.66 cents per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:14 a.m. in Toronto, from 95.54 on April 8, when the
currency touched 95.27 cents, the strongest level since Nov. 14,
2007. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0454.  The Bank of Canada, which led the Group of Seven nations
with three interest-rate increases last year, is expected to
keep its benchmark at 1 percent, according to the weighted
average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 27 economists.
The central bank, has kept its benchmark at 1 percent since
September.  Policy makers reiterated on March 1 that “considerable
slack” remains in the economy. Exporters face “considerable
challenges” from a  currency trading  at a more than a three-year
high, they said.  To contact the reporters for this story:
