U.S. corn inventories probably
won’t fall further because current levels are near the minimum
necessary for users to keep products flowing, U.S. Department of
Agriculture Chief Economist  Joe Glauber  said.  Increased use of wheat for  animal feed  and additional corn
plantings in Southern states that harvest earlier in the year
than in the Midwest also will keep inventories from declining
further, Glauber said today at the North American Agricultural
Journalists annual meeting in Washington.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010. Wheat ranks fourth at $13 billion, behind soybeans and
hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
