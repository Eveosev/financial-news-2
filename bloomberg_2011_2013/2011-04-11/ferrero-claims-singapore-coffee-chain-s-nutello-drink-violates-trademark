Ferrero SpA, the maker of the
Nutella hazelnut spread controlled by billionaire Michele Ferrero, sought to stop a  Singapore  coffee shop chain from
selling a drink called Nutello, claiming a trademark violation.  Sarika Connoisseur Cafe Pte, owner of 30 coffee shop
outlets in Singapore, is trying to pass off the Nutello drink as
being associated with Nutella, Ferrero claimed in a lawsuit
filed in Singapore High Court.  “Nutella is an invented word; it’s highly distinctive,”
Ferrero’s lawyer M. Ravindran told Judge Chan Seng Onn at the
start of a trial today. The mark is the lifeblood of the product,
he said. The trial is scheduled to run till April 15.  Sarika  has denied wrongdoing. There’s no similarity between
the “Nutella” and “Nutello” marks, which have different
fonts, designs and color schemes, and the public isn’t likely to
be confused by the two, its lawyer Tan Tee Jim said in a
submission to the court.  Ferrero,  which has 21,500 employees and 18 factories around
the world, also makes Ferrero Rocher truffles and tic tac sweets.  Michele Ferrero and his family ranked 32nd among the
world’s wealthiest people with $18 billion, Forbes magazine’s
U.S. edition reported in March.  The case is Ferrero Spa v Sarika Connoisseur Cafe Pte.
