Most Asian stocks fell, led by
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co., after Citigroup Inc.
downgraded  Japan ’s carmakers amid continued disruption from the
country’s record earthquake and higher energy and commodity
prices.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at 136.48 at
12:47 p.m. in  Tokyo , with almost two stocks sliding for each
that gained.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
