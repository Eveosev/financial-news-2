Two former University of  San Diego 
basketball players and an ex-assistant coach were charged in a
scheme to fix games.  Brandon Johnson, who according to the university’s website
was its career leader in points and assists, was arrested in
Houston on April 9, the U.S. attorney’s office in San Diego said
today in a  statement .  Johnson, 24, is among 10 people charged in the case with
conspiracy to commit sports bribery, operate an illegal
bookmaking service and distribute marijuana, according to
according to an indictment unsealed today in federal court in
San Diego. The group used money from bookmaking and selling
marijuana to bribe players and to bet in  Las Vegas  on the games
they had fixed, according to the indictment.  “The drug trafficking and sports betting charged in this
case were organized and substantial and reflect diversification
of criminality that we will not tolerate,” U.S. Attorney Laura
Duffy said in the statement. “Whether in the area of politics,
law, or sports, the phrase ‘the fix was in’ sends chills down
the spine of all Americans.”  The case docket on the website of the San Diego federal
court didn’t list a lawyer for Johnson. Assistant U.S. Attorney
Harold Chun didn’t immediately return a call to his office.  University of San Diego is a private institution.  The case is U.S. v. Goria, 11-1345, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  California  (San Diego).  To contact the reporter on this story:
