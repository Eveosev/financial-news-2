Gold may decline in  New York  as
some investors sell the metal following its rally to a record
and after the African Union said Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
agreed to a cease-fire. Silver reached a 31-year high.  Libya ’s rebels said a plan proposed by the African Union
and agreed to by Qaddafi won’t be acceptable if it allows the
ruler and his sons to retain power.  Germany  warned that deficit-
scarred  Greece  might need more financial relief as  Portugal 
seeks an 80 billion-euro ($116 billion) aid package. U.S.
reports this week may show inflation is quickening, economists
said.  “Profit-taking has emerged” and “a further pullback
could be seen” on news that Qaddafi accepted a peace proposal,
 James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in
a report to clients today. Still, “ongoing concerns of European
Union debt, low  interest rates  and ongoing inflation concerns
are bullish” for gold, he said.  Gold futures for June delivery fell $3.10, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,471 an ounce at 7:59 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices
earlier today gained as much as 0.3 percent to an all-time high
of $1,478. The metal for immediate delivery in London was down
0.3 percent at $1,470.05 after reaching a record $1,478.18.  Bullion was unchanged at $1,469.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from the afternoon fixing on April 8.  Inflation Expectations  The difference between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of traders’
expectations for inflation, widened to as much as 2.66
percentage points, the most since March 2008. Reports this week
may show U.S. consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month from
February, and wholesale prices and the cost of goods imported
into the U.S. climbed, according to Bloomberg surveys of
economists.  After almost two months of fighting, Libyan rebels and
troops loyal to Qaddafi have fought to a stalemate. Qaddafi
agreed to accept a peace plan that called for a cease-fire with
rebels, the  African Union  said. There was no mention of Qaddafi
agreeing to step down.  Gold held in exchange-traded products rose 19.98 metric
tons to 2,049.15 tons on April 8, the highest level since
Jan. 24, data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show. UBS
AG today raised its one-month bullion forecast to $1,500, from
$1,450.  Silver Gains  Silver for May delivery in New York climbed as much as 3.4
percent to $41.975 an ounce, the highest level since January
1980, when futures reached a record $50.35. It last traded at
$41.33. An ounce of gold bought as little as 35.16 ounces of
silver in London today, the least since September 1983, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We continue to believe that silver will reach $50, based
nearly exclusively on speculator activity,”  Edel Tully , a UBS
analyst in  London , said today in a report to clients. “Silver
could surge to $45 this week, before very quickly surrendering
double-digit percentage gains. It takes a brave investor to buy
silver right now.”  Silver ETP holdings gained 30.36 tons to 15,453.45 tons on
April 8, the highest level since at least February last year,
data from four providers show.  Palladium for June delivery was little changed at $795 an
ounce after touching a one-month high of $805.25. Platinum for
July delivery declined 0.4 percent to $1,804.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
