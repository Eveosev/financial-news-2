A 43-year-old woman died in a fire
on a  London Midland  train from Northampton to Euston station in
 London  today, London Midland spokesman Richard Lakin said by
telephone. Service on the West Coast mainline was “severely”
disrupted throughout the evening, the company said on its
website.  Lakin said the train was approaching Leighton Buzzard
station, in Bedfordshire,  England , when a passenger reported a
fire in a toilet at about 4:25 p.m., local time. The train was
halted at Leighton Buzzard, all passengers were taken off and
the train was boarded by a fire crew, who discovered the
fatality, Lakin said.  A British Transport Police officer confirmed the woman was
found in the toilet where the fire was reported. He said the
death was not being treated as an accident, but that no other
person was involved. The woman had injuries consistent with
burns, and the train has been moved to a siding for forensic
testing. He declined to provide any other details and said there
would be no further updates issued tonight.  London Midland, which is a unit of  Go-Ahead Group Plc (GOG) , said
its services resumed at 7:30 p.m., and a “contingency”
timetable will be operated tonight, Lakin said. Tomorrow’s
services are expected to resume “as normal,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
