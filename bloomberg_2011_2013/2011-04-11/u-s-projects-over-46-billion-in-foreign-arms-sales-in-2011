The U.S. Defense Department expects
fiscal year 2011 arms exports to exceed $46 billion, driven by
demand for aircraft and air-defense systems, a defense official
said today.  “This fiscal year is forecast to be higher than ever --
higher than $46 billion,” said Richard Genaille, deputy
director of the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency,
at the annual conference of the Navy League at National Harbor,
Maryland.  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s C-130J and  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s C-17
transport planes were “hot” items in demand by arms-buying
nations, he said.  The C-17s, C-130Js, aerial drones, F-35 fighter jets and
missile defense systems typify “new areas where we can expect
to see growth over time” that keeps sales at as much as $40
billion over the next several years, he said.  Saudi Arabia ’s $60 billion purchase of Chicago-based
Boeing’s F-15 jets, helicopters, munitions and infrastructure
improvements and the purchase by the  United Arab Emirates  of
Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed’s proposed $6 billion Terminal
High Altitude Area Defense missile system have been approved and
are proceeding without delay, Genaille said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
