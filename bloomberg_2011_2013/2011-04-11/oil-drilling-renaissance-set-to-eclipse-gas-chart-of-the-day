Oil rigs may soon become more
common in the U.S. than natural-gas platforms for the first time
since 1995, reflecting a surge in crude prices to more than $100
a barrel in  New York .  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the number of platforms that
operate on land, in inland waters and offshore. Baker Hughes
Inc., the world’s third-largest provider of oilfield services,
compiles the figures weekly.  Last week’s total of 886 oil rigs was the highest since the
company started tracking them separately in 1987. The number has
jumped almost fivefold since sinking to an almost four-year low
in June 2009, including a 13 percent gain in the past six weeks.  There were three fewer platforms drilling for oil than for
gas last week, according to Baker Hughes’s data. The gap was 454
rigs a year earlier. The swing coincided with a 33 percent
increase for crude in New York trading, which compared with a
0.7 percent decline for gas.  “The U.S. land-rig market is no longer a natural-gas-
driven story,” Judson E. Bailey, an analyst at Jefferies & Co.,
wrote today in a report. “A renaissance in oil-directed
activity is just beginning.”  Oil may account for 74 percent of rigs in the fourth
quarter of next year, Bailey estimated. The projection includes
platforms that extract crude from shale formations and carry out
other types of so-called unconventional drilling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
