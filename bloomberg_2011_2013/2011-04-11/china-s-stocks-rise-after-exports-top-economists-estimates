China ’s stocks rose, extending the
benchmark index’s gains to a fifth day, after exports and
imports topped estimates last month, bolstering speculation the
economy is withstanding government measures to curb inflation.  Hebei Iron & Steel Co., the listed unit of China’s biggest
steelmaker, jumped the most since May 2009 after Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co. said first-quarter profit at “major”
steel producers may have almost tripled from the previous
quarter. PetroChina Co. and China Shenhua Energy Co., the
largest oil and coal companies, gained more than 1 percent as
 oil prices  topped $112 a barrel for the first time since 2008.  “With economic growth still strengthening and a low risk
of a sharp slowdown, we still like these big-cap stocks,” said
Wu Kan, a  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees
$285 million. “Their valuations are attractive.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 23.22, or 0.8 percent, to
3,053.24 at the 11:30 a.m. local-time break, set for the highest
since Nov. 11. It climbed 2.1 percent last week after the
central bank boosted interest rates for the fourth time since
October. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 0.6 percent to 3,373.51.  The Shanghai Composite has surged 8.7 percent this year,
making China the best performer among the biggest Asian markets,
as optimism about growth in the world’s second-largest economy
and corporate earnings has outweighed measures to cool inflation
that reached a 28-month high in November. The central bank has
raised the reserve-requirement ratio nine times since the start
of 2010 and borrowing costs four times.  Exports Rise  Exports jumped 35.8 percent in March and imports climbed
27.3 percent, the customs bureau said yesterday. The growth in
exports beat the forecasts of 24 out of 25 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey and was 53 percent higher than the median
estimate and the gain in imports topped the 20.6 percent
forecast. The $140 million  trade surplus  compared with the
median forecast for a deficit of $3.35 billion.  “Trade growth will remain robust due both to the robust
real economy and to rising prices,” Ting Lu, economist at Bank
of America-Merrill Lynch, said in a note to clients.  Hebei Steel surged 8.7 percent to 4.50 yuan. Baoshan Iron &
Steel Co., the listed unit of the second-biggest steelmaker,
added 2.1 percent to 7.39 yuan. Angang Steel Co. gained 3.3
percent to 8.56 yuan.  First-quarter profit at major steelmakers may have jumped
188 percent from the fourth quarter last year, Zheng Zhiguo and
Mao Shenjing, analysts at Shenyin & Wanguo, wrote in a report
today. Steelmakers trade at 0.54 times book value, less than the
historical average of 0.6 times, it said.  Oil Rises  Crude oil for May delivery rose 2.5 percent to $112.79 in
 New York  on April 8, the highest settlement since Sept. 22,
2008, on skepticism that Libyan output will rebound and as a
weaker dollar increased demand for raw materials. The contract
gained as much as 0.6 percent to $113.46 in after-hours trading.  PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil company, added 1.3
percent to 12.33 yuan. Shenhua, China’s largest coal producer,
climbed 4.8 percent to 31.34 yuan. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., the
fourth biggest, added 3.8 percent to 39.10 yuan.  “March export figures came in stronger than expected,
shrugging off the impact of  Japan ’s disaster and the surge in
oil prices,” said  Qu Hongbin , chief China economist at HSBC
Holdings Plc in  Hong Kong . “This reconfirms that inflation
rather than growth remains as the key risk for China. Get ready
for more reserve ratio and rate hikes in the coming months.”  Rate Outlook  Inflation accelerated to 5.2 percent in March, exceeding
the government’s 2011 target of 4 percent for the third month,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
China’s gross domestic product expanded 9.4 percent in the first
quarter, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. The economy grew 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter. The
figures are due on April 15.  China may continue to raise  interest rates  this year as the
country still faces pressure of rising prices and its deposit
rate remains in the negative territory, the China Securities
Journal reported today, citing Xia Bin, an adviser to the
People’s Bank of China.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  asked local governments to take
responsibility to keep housing affordable and said stabilizing
consumer prices in the country is the top priority.  The central government’s aim to control the  property market 
is “clear” and the determination is “firm,” Wen said during
a visit to Zhejiang province, according to a statement on the
government’s  web site  over the weekend.  Sell Chinese Stocks  Investors should sell Chinese stocks after recent rallies
given the risk of faster inflation and slowing economic growth,
according to Citic Securities Co.  A possible slowdown in economic growth in the second
quarter may hold back a rebound for so-called cyclical stocks,
analysts led by Xi Feng wrote in a report today. The Shanghai
Composite may be “range-bound” between 2,600 points and 3,100
points in April, it said.  FAW Car Co., which makes passenger cars with Volkswagen AG,
lost 2.3 percent to 16.79 yuan. The stock climbed 4.8 percent on
April 8. Beiqi Foton Motor Co., the biggest commercial-vehicle
maker, fell 2.3 percent to 23.56 yuan.  Passenger-car sales rose 6.5 percent from a year earlier to
1.3 million units in March, the association said yesterday. That
pace was about one-tenth of the 63 percent sales increase
reported in March of last year.  Sales growth this year may fall short of the association’s
previous estimate for an increase of 10 percent to 15 percent,
said Dong Yang, vice chairman of the association.  Auto sales surged 32 percent to a record 18.1 million last
year, helping China stay the world’s largest vehicle market for
the second year. The government ended incentives for purchases
and raised fuel prices twice this year.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
