Gold futures fell on sales by
investors after a rally to a record of $1,478 an ounce. Silver
climbed close to $42 an ounce, extending a surge to a 31-year
high.  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  agreed to accept an African
Union peace plan that may lead to a cease-fire with rebels,
eroding demand for gold as an investment haven. Silver gained
for the sixth straight session, the longest rally in four
months.  “People are quick to take profit when gold reaches a
record,” said  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in Chicago. “The silver market is the one everyone is
in love with and afraid of missing the boat. People fully expect
silver to get to $50.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell $6, or 0.4 percent, to
settle at $1,468.10 at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The
price has climbed 26 percent in the past 12 months.  Silver futures for May delivery advanced 0.4 cent to
$40.612. Earlier, the metal reached $41.975, the highest since
January 1980. The price has more than doubled in the past year.
The record in 1980 was $50.35.  Unrest in the Middle East and northern  Africa  this year
drove crude oil to a 30-month high and boosted demand for
precious metals as a hedge against inflation. Oil futures in New
York dropped as much as 2.9 percent after the  International
Monetary Fund  cut growth estimates for the U.S. and Japan.  “Anything that takes away the  risk premium  is going to
weigh on gold,” Zeman said.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $5.95, or 0.7
percent, to $788.25 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The metal has gained 53 percent in the past 12 months.  Platinum futures for July delivery dropped $19.30, or 1.1
percent, to $1,792.80, the biggest drop in almost four weeks.
The price has climbed 3.8 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
