DP World Ltd. (DPW) , the Dubai
government-controlled ports operator, had its credit ratings
raised to investment grade from junk at Moody’s Investors
Service, which cited a “rapid recovery” in performance.  The yield on the 6.25 percent 10-year Islamic bond dropped
to the lowest on record. The long-term foreign currency and
local currency debt ratings, which affect $3.25 billion of
borrowings, were lifted one level to Baa3 from Ba1, Moody’s said
in an e-mailed statement today. The outlook is stable.  The ratings “are sustained by the company’s diversified
global operations, the expected growth in international
container traffic as well as solid profitability and a strong
liquidity profile,” Franck Nowak, associate analyst at Moody’s
in Dubai, wrote in the statement.  DP World reported a better-than-expected 13 percent
increase in full-year profit, helped by a rebound in global
trade and improved profit margins.  Net income  rose to $374.8
million from $332.9 million a year earlier, the world’s fourth-
biggest port operator said March 23. The company said volumes
handled at its 28 terminals worldwide grew 9 percent in 2010 to
27.8 million twenty-foot-equivalent containers, as global trade
recovered.  The yield on the $1.5 billion sukuk maturing in July 2017
dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 6.10
percent at 6:16 p.m. in Dubai. The shares rose 1.6 percent to 69
cents, the highest since September 2008.  DP World is expected to “remain within the boundaries of
its leverage target by avoiding large acquisitions, and
gradually improving cash generation,” Nowak wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
