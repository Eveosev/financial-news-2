Fomento de Construcciones &
Contratas SA’s Waste Recycling Group unit in the U.K. will start
converting its U.K. refuse dumps into wind farms,  Cinco Dias 
reported, without citing anyone.  Waste Reclycling won permits to install the first six
megawatts of capacity and aims to reach between 80 and 100
megawatts, which may require an investment of 115 million euros
($166 million), the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
