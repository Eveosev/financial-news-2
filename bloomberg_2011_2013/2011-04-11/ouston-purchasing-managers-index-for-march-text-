Following is the text from the
Houston purchasing managers report.  Prices and Purchased Inventory were Leading Indicators  The Institute for Supply Management -- Houston reported
this month that the Houston Purchasing Managers Index PMI was
59.9 for March, 2011.   Economic activity in the Houston area
has been positive for the last eighteen consecutive months and
improved another 1.3 points over last month.  This is continues
higher then the 2010 high of 59.0 in May, 2010.  The PMI, which indicates likely shifts in Production volume
three or four months in advance, now shows a signal that
production is still continuing to move forward.  The PMI has a
possible range of 0 to 100.  Reading’s over 50 indicate
production gains over the near term; readings below 50, show
coming contraction.  The Houston PMI is based on diffusion indexes for eight
indicators. (A diffusion index is simply the percentage of
respondents reporting increases from the previous month less the
percentage reporting declines.)  The Houston PMI which is based
on eight components had five categories reporting improvement
from February to March.  Prices Paid was the leading indicator increasing 15 points
to 53 PMI.  55% of our participants responded that prices
increased in March, 2011.  Purchased Inventory, a reverse
indicator, fell from 15 to 5 PMI.  A falling inventory shows
demand over the production levels.  Finished Goods also a reverse indicator fell from -3 to -10.
Employment at 20 increased 5 points from last month.  The other
positive indicator was Lead Times increased to 25 PMI.  Sales at
23 fell 10 points from the high last month and Production also
declined 10 points to 20 PMI for the month.  The other negative
for the month was Purchases, which decreased 5 points to 20.  The latest Employment numbers indicate that our
respondent’s increased employment 5 points while only 8% had a
reduction in staff.  This total number indicates employment is
improving and at the highest level for 2010 -11.  93% of the
respondents had the Same or Increased Employment levels.  This
remains to be good news for those looking for jobs at this time.  The Houston PMI has averaged 56.5 over the last twelve
months.  There has been an improvement in the PMI number of
34.9% since March, 2009.  The  Institute for Supply Management  - Houston has published
the Houston Purchasing Managers Index monthly since January,
1995 as a service to its members and the wider Houston business
community.  SOURCE: Institute for Supply Management
