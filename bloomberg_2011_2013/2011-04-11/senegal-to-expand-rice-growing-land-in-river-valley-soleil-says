Senegal  will convert 125,000
hectares (308,882 acres) of land in the Senegal River valley
into an area for growing rice by 2015, le Soleil reported,
citing Minister of Agriculture Khadim Gueye.  The West African nation will increase subsidies for seed
and fertilizer purchased in the valley, the Dakar-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
