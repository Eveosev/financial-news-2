South African President  Jacob Zuma 
said a meeting between representatives of the  African Union  and
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  in Tripoli yesterday was a “huge
success.”  The AU panel is “very happy with the outcome” of the
talks, Zuma said today an e-mailed statement from the
Presidency, based in the capital,  Pretoria . “Only an inclusive
dialogue among the Libyan parties” will ensure a solution to
the political crisis, Zuma said.  Zuma returned to  South Africa  today without meeting with
Libyan rebel leaders.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
