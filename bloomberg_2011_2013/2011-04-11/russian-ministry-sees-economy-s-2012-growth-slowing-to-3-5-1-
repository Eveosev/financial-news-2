Russian economic growth may slow
more than previously forecast next year as  oil prices  stagnate
and the government uses its energy revenue this year to rebuild
the nation’s sovereign wealth funds, the Economy Ministry said.  The ministry revised down its growth forecast to 3.5
percent in 2012 from the previous estimate for a 3.9 percent
increase, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  told reporters
today in Moscow.  “Practically all of the increased revenue from higher oil
prices is going to the  Reserve Fund  and the National Wellbeing
Fund instead of toward boosting expenditures,” Klepach said.  The weaker growth forecast signals the world’s biggest
energy supplier will struggle to meet President Dmitry Medvedev’s target of achieving expansion of as much as 10
percent within five years. Growth of 4 percent annually “isn’t
enough” to pull  Russia  into line with emerging-market peers in
 China , Brazil and  India , the president said in January.  The government will propose 300 billion rubles ($11
billion) in additional spending this year, including on
pensions, wages and agriculture, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin
told lawmakers on April 6. The government seeks to double its
Reserve Fund, which collects excess oil revenue, to 1.45
trillion rubles this year.  Budget Deficit  This year’s federal budget deficit may narrow to 0.6 to 0.8
percent of gross domestic product from an earlier estimate of
3.6 percent, Klepach said.  Urals crude, Russia’s main export blend, will average $105
under the ministry’s base scenario this year before falling to
$93 in 2012, according to a copy of the  Economy Ministry 
forecast e-mailed today. The blend has surged 32 percent this
year and was trading at $121.68 a barrel today.  Industrial-output growth will probably slow to 3.5 percent
next year, from a forecast 5.4 percent in 2011, according to the
ministry. Retail sales may grow 4.5 percent next year while
investment in productive capacity may increase 8.8 percent.  The inflation rate may drop to 5 percent to 6 percent next
year from a forecast 7 percent to 7.5 percent in 2011, according
to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
