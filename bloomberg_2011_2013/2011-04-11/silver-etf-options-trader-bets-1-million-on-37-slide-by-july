A trader’s almost $1 million bet
that an exchange-traded fund tracking silver will decline by
July was today’s biggest single options trade on U.S. exchanges
as futures on the metal reached a 31-year high.  The 100,000 puts, or options to sell 100 shares each of the
 iShares Silver Trust (SLV)  at $25 by July, changed hands at the ask
price of about 10 cents and exceeded the open interest of 6,054
outstanding contracts before today, indicating that a buyer of a
new bearish position initiated the transaction. The ETF rose to
$40.33, the highest intraday level since trading began five
years ago, before falling 1.6 percent to $39.21 at 4 p.m. New
York time. It hasn’t closed below $25 since November.  “It’s definitely a massive downside bet on silver,” said
 Henry Schwartz , president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based
provider of options-market data and analytics. “It’s so far out
of the money that the buyer is probably just looking for a
moderate pullback because a $3 retracement to where it was in
March could double the position to $2 million.”  Silver for May delivery in  New York  climbed as much as 3.4
percent to $41.975 an ounce, the highest level since January
1980, when futures reached a record $50.35. It last traded at
$40.61. Silver, where half of global consumption is industrial,
has been rising because it benefits from a rebounding global
economy as well as demand for a haven, according to UBS AG.  The trade accounted for almost a quarter of the 385,667
silver ETF puts changing hands today, the most since November
and five times the four-week average. About 1.2 puts traded for
each call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
