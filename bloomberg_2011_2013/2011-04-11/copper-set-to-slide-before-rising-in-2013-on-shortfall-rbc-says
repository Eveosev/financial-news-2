Copper prices are set to fall next
year before rebounding in 2013 on shrinking inventories,
according to  RBC Capital Markets .  Copper will average $4.25 a pound this year, $3.75 next
year and $4 in 2013, Fraser Phillips, a Toronto-based analyst at
RBC, said in a note to investors dated April 8. Prices may reach
$4.50 a pound through 2015, according to the note.  “After a substantial deficit in 2010, we forecast a
roughly balanced market in 2011 through 2013,” RBC said. “In
2014 and 2015, a growing deficit will push inventories down to
minimum levels.”  Copper futures traded on the Comex in  New York  climbed to a
record $4.6575 on Feb. 15 on surging Asian consumption of the
metal used in homes, cars and appliances. Demand may outpace
production this year by as much as 500,000 metric tons,  Andrew Harding , head of Rio Tinto Group’s copper unit, said in an April
6 interview.  Inventories are currently at 6.6 weeks of consumption,
compared with 6 weeks at the beginning of 2011 and a so-called
critical level of 4.5 weeks, RBC said.  “In the near term, investment demand has pushed prices
above the levels we would expect from the fundamentals alone,
and we forecast a modest correction in 2012,” the brokerage
said. Mine output will grow by 7.9 percent this year, 4.3
percent in 2012 and 6.9 percent in 2013, before slowing to 1
percent in 2014, RBC estimates show.  Mine Investment  Copper mines worldwide are attracting investors on
expectation  China ’s demand for the metal will continue to grow.  Minmetals Resources Ltd. bid about C$6.3 billion ($6.6
billion) for Equinox Minerals Ltd. on April 4 to gain control of
Zambia’s Lumwana deposit,  Africa ’s largest copper mine. Vale SA
last week offered to buy South African copper producer Metorex
Ltd., while First Quantum Minerals Ltd., which bought  Peru ’s
Haquira copper venture last year, has said it’s interested in
acquiring another project in the country.  “Latin America should remain the largest source of mine
production, although we expect a resurgence of African
production over the longer term,” RBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
