North Sea loadings of Troll crude
oil will total 12 cargoes in May, two less than April, according
to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Shipments of May will total 7 million barrels, or 225,806
barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with 8.4 million
barrels, or 280,000 barrels a day, expected to load this month.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil company, operates the
field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
