The  Palestinian Authority  plans to
tell international donors this week it will be ready to
establish an independent state during September, Planning
Minister Ali Al-Jerbawi said.  The assessment is contained in a report being prepared for
presentation to an April 13 donorsâ€™ conference in Brussels, Al-
Jerbawi said today in an e-mailed statement.  Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad started a
project in August to strengthen government institutions such as
the security forces and tax collecting in preparation for
statehood, setting a two-year goal for completion.  Fayyad said at the time he hoped peace negotiations would
be concluded by this September. With talks snagged for the past
seven months, Palestinians are now exploring the prospect of
seeking international recognition for statehood through the
 United Nations .  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will only
cooperate with a Palestinian state if it is established through
direct negotiations with the Israeli government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
