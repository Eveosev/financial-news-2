Gold climbed to a record and silver
topped $41 an ounce, gaining for a ninth straight day in the
best run since March 2008, as investors sought precious metals
as hedges against accelerating inflation.  Immediate-delivery bullion gained as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,478.18 an ounce and traded at $1,473.72 at 3:18 p.m. in
Singapore. Gold for June in  New York  climbed as much as 0.3
percent to $1,478 an ounce, also an all-time high. Cash silver
advanced as much as 2.5 percent to $41.9525 an ounce, the
highest level since 1980, before trading at $41.5525 an ounce.  “Commodities across the board are rallying, aggravating
the inflation outlook,” said Chae Un Soo, a Seoul-based trader
at KEB Futures Co. “For now, more and more investors are
looking to precious metals as a shelter.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw-materials
futures reached 760.81 points on April 8, the highest level
since Aug. 4, 2008. Crude touched a 30-month high of $113.46 per
barrel today amid fighting in  Libya  and unrest in the Middle
East. The  European Central Bank  last week raised borrowing costs
from a record low to fight accelerating prices.  The difference between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of traders’
expectations for inflation, widened to as much as 2.64
percentage points last week, the most since March 2008. The
Federal Reserve has kept the benchmark rate at zero percent to
0.25 percent since December 2008 to stimulate growth. The ECB
raised the main interest rate 25 basis points to 1.25 percent.  Gold strengthened 3.8 percent this year after rallying 30
percent in 2010 on the prospect of currency debasement and
rising inflation. The fighting in the Middle East, a nuclear
crisis in  Japan  and European sovereign-debt problems have also
bolstered demand for precious metals.  Survey Outlook  Fifteen of 18 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 83 percent, said that bullion will rise this week.
Two predicted lower prices and one was neutral. Hedge-fund
managers and other large speculators increased their net-long
position in New York gold futures in the week ended April 5,
according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 204,706 contracts on the Comex
division of the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the commission
said in its Commitments of Traders report. Net-long positions
rose by 11,585 contracts, or 6 percent, from a week earlier.  The dollar has come under pressure as “the easy monetary
policy of the  Federal Reserve  is a contrast against the gradual
tightening stance taken by other central banks,” said Ong Yi
Ling, Singapore-based analyst with Phillip Futures Pte. “A weak
dollar increases the appeal of gold as a currency alternative.”  Dollar Index  The Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the dollar’s
value, fell 0.2 percent, trading near the lowest level since
December 2009. Gold typically moves inversely to the dollar.  Investors regard silver as “a cheap vehicle” similar to
gold as a store of value, Morgan Stanley said in a report last
week. The metal will average $31.39 an ounce this year, up 20
percent from a previous forecast, the bank said.  Immediate-delivery palladium climbed 0.6 percent to $801.25
an ounce, while platinum weakened 0.3 percent to $1,809 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
