*Chile’s monthly inflation rate in March increased at its
fastest pace since September 2009 on higher prices of food and
beverages, clothing, utilities and transport, the National
Statistics Institute said. Consumer prices climbed 0.8 percent
in March from the previous month, the institute said in a report

by Bloomberg. Consumer prices rose 3.4 percent from last year.  EQUITIES:
