The U.K.’s Independent Commission
on Banking, led by  John Vickers , will propose measures to ring-
fence “essential” services and to boost competition in retail
banking in its interim report on the structure of the banking
industry to be published today, the Financial Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , which provides almost one in
three U.K. retail bank accounts, may be forced to divest more
branches than the 600 it is already selling off, the FT said,
without attribution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
