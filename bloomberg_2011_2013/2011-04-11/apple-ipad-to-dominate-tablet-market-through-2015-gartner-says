Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad tablet will
continue to dominate the market for tablet computers,
controlling more than three-fifths of the market next year,
technology research firm  Gartner Inc. (IT)  predicts.  Apple’s iOS platform, which powers its iPhone and iPad
devices, will account for 69 percent of the market this year and
64 percent in 2012, Gartner said. Apple’s share will decline to
47 percent in 2015, according to the  report  today.  The iPad has triggered a flurry of competitors as hardware
makers recognized the pent-up demand for devices that straddle
the gap between a smartphone and a laptop computer. Apple has
sold more than 15 million iPads since they went on sale last
April, and the company may have sold 500,000 of the iPad 2
follow-up model since it went on sale last month, according to
projections by analysts at Piper Jaffray Cos. and Deutsche Bank
AG.  The only other tablet operating system forecast to come
close is  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android, which is used in Motorola Inc.’s
Xoom and Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy Tab. Android’s share
of the market is expected to reach 24 percent next year and 39
percent in 2015, Gartner said.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) ’s QNX platform for Blackberry
Playbook should account for 5.6 percent of the industry this
year, 6.6 percent in 2012, and 10 percent in 2015.  RIM’s market share growth will be constrained by a shortage
of developers building applications for the PlayBook that
consumers look for, Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi said in
the report.  “It will take time and significant effort for RIM to
attract developers and deliver a compelling ecosystem of
applications and services around QNX to position it as a viable
alternative to Apple or Android,” she wrote.  The PlayBook, which goes on sale in the U.S. on April 19,
may sell 5.4 million of the devices over the fiscal year which
began Feb. 27, predicts Alkesh Shah, an analyst with Evercore
Partners Inc.  PlayBook sales will be 3.9 million devices in 2011,
eclipsed by a forecast of almost 48 million iPad sales, Gartner
said.  -- Editors: Lisa Rapaport, Ville Heiskanen  To contact the reporter on this story:
