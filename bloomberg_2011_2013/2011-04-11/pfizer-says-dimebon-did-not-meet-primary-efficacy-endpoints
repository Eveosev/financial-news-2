Medivation Inc. (MDVN)  and  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) 
said their experimental drug Dimebon failed to ease Huntington’s
disease symptoms and testing for the illness will end.  Study of the medicine as a treatment for  Alzheimer’s
disease  will continue, the companies said in a statement. In
Huntington’s, Dimebon didn’t work better than a placebo in
lessening mental decline.  Dimebon, a 28-year-old hay fever treatment, failed in a
trial for Alzheimer’s disease in March 2010. Caused by a genetic
defect on chromosome 4, Huntington’s has no cure and there is no
way to prevent the disease from worsening, according to the
National Institutes of Medicine.  “Huntington’s is a challenging disease area, and we are
also disappointed,” said Steve Romano, the head of Pfizer’s
medicines development group, in the statement.  Huntington’s  symptoms include antisocial behavior,
hallucinations, irritability, paranoia, abnormal movements and
dementia.  Medivation, based in  San Francisco , rose 37 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $20.48 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading. Pfizer, based in New York, rose 21
cents, or 1 percent, to $20.67 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
