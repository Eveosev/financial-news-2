Two-time champion Joan Benoit Samuelson will run the Boston Marathon for the first time in 18 
years.  Samuelson, 53, who won an Olympic gold medal in 1984, will
join about 66 other top female marathoners in the elite women’s
group at the April 18 race, the Boston Athletic Association said
on the  marathon’s website .  Samuelson set an American record in 1979 by finishing the
Boston Marathon in 2 hours, 35 minutes, 15 seconds. Her 1983
finish, 2:22:43, was a world record and remains the fourth-
fastest women’s time in the race’s history.  Samuelson has said that she may use the marathon to pursue
the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials qualifying time of 2:46, according
to the Boston Athletic Association.  In 2009, Samuelson ran the New York City Marathon, setting
a 50-plus age record of 2:49:09 to finish 17th in the women’s
race. She improved her time in the Chicago Marathon last
October, posting a 2:47:50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
