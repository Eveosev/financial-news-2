Michael Page International Plc (MPI) , the
U.K.’s second-biggest recruitment company, said first-quarter
gross profit rose 30 percent to 127.3 million pounds ($208
million), led by growth in Asia and Latin America.  Gross profit from permanent hiring gained 35 percent to
101.1 million pounds, while profit from temporary placements
increased 14 percent to 26.2 million pounds, the Weybridge,
England-based company said in a statement on Regulatory News
Service.  Michael Page  more than doubled its workforce in Asia last
year, as it seeks to expand there as well as in Latin America
and the Middle East to compensate for weak economies in Britain
and Ireland. Gross profit increased 63 percent in its Asia
Pacific region, while Latin America advanced 73 percent, the
company said.  “We have now had four quarters of broadly similar gross
profit growth, at constant currency, and we expect tougher
comparative periods to affect growth rates going forward,”
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ingham said in the statement.
“The outlook in  Asia  and Latin America remains positive, and
Europe continues to improve, all of which gives us confidence
that we are well positioned to exceed our 2010 profit
performance”  To contact the reporter on this story:
