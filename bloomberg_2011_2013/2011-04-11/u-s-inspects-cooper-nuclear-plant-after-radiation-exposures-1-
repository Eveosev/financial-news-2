The  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  is inspecting a reactor at a Nebraska power plant
after three workers received “unplanned radiation exposures”
last week, the agency said.  The  Nebraska Public Power District , which operates the
 Cooper Nuclear Station , doesn’t believe the workers received
higher doses than allowed under NRC regulations in the April 3
incident, the agency said today in a statement on its website.  The workers were exposed while removing a radioactive tube
from the bottom of the reactor, rather than following procedure
and taking it from the top, the NRC said. When radiation alarms
were triggered, the workers set down the tube and immediately
left the reactor area, the regulator said.  “We want to understand why normal work practices were not
followed,” Elmo Collins, a regional administrator for the NRC
in Arlington,  Texas , said in the statement.  The NRC announced the inspection at the Cooper plant, 23
miles south of Nebraska City, while conducting a 90-day safety
review of all U.S. reactors. The examination was prompted by a
partial meltdown at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-
Ichi plant in  Japan , which was damaged by a March 11 earthquake
and tsunami.  The Nebraska Public Power District will cooperate fully
with the investigation, Mark Becker, a spokesman for the
utility, said in an interview.  The plant was shut down on March 13 for refueling, Becker
said. The plant is to restart later this month, he said. No
radiation was released “external to the plant,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
