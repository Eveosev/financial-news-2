Ukraine’s prosecutors opened a
criminal case against former Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko ,
accusing her of abuse of power related to natural-gas contracts
her government signed with Russia in 2009.  “An investigator has studied the materials supplied by the
security service of Ukraine,” First Deputy Prosecutor General
Renat Kuzmin said today in comments broadcast on Ukrainian
television, adding that Tymoshenko’s actions caused 1.5 billion
hryvnia ($188 million) of damage to the country. “The grounds
and reasons for opening this criminal case are indisputable.”  Tymoshenko, who lost a presidential election to  Viktor Yanukovych  last year, was ordered not to leave the country in
December after another criminal probe was started against her.
She’s accused of misusing funds from the 2009 sale of emissions
permits to  Japan . She has denied the allegations.  Prosecutors have also conducted investigations into six
officials of Tymoshenko’s government and detained some of them.
Former Economy Minister Bohdan Danylyshyn in January received
political asylum in the Czech Republic.  To contact the reporters on this story:
