Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, the
Serbian  oil company  controlled by Russia’s OAO Gazprom Neft,
will complete upgrades at its main refinery in 2012 to export
more to regional markets with fuels of Euro 5 quality.  The upgrades in Pancevo,  Serbia , which have cost 212
million euros ($306 million) so far, will account for more than
two-thirds of the 500 million-euro investment that Gazprom Neft
pledged to invest and enable it to increase refinery sales to
more than 3 million tons of gas and diesel in 2013, said Alexey
Urusov, the deputy chief executive in charge of Finance and
Accounting.  “We will rely on Pancevo for refining fuels and it will
enable us to become a major regional player in the Balkan
region,” Urusov said at a presentation in Belgrade today. The
company’s other refinery, in Novi Sad, will be used only for
producing base oils and lubricants.  Pancevo refinery’s capacity of processing 4.8 million tons
of crude a year will not be increased, “but the focus will be
on improved quality” as the volume of demand on the Serbian and
neighboring markets is not expected to increase. “We plan to
move entirely to Euro 5 standards.”  He said demand on the Serbian market has been in steady
decline since 2007, apparently due to the economic downturn and
improved fuel efficiency. The demand last year was 3.4 million
tons of oil products, compared with 3.94 million tons in 2007.
He declined to estimate demand in 2011, saying only that “it
may stabilize or possibly make a small increase.”  Return to Profit  Nis lost its monopoly on oil imports to Serbia this year,
though it remains the sole refiner in the Balkan country, where
it also operates  oil fields  and a retail network.  It reported 2010 net income before extraordinary items of
16.5 billion dinars ($236 million), compared with a loss of 37.7
billion dinars in 2009.  Gazprom Neft bought 51 percent of NIS for 400 million euros
in early 2009 with a commitment to invest another 500 million
euros. It recently raised the stake to 56.15 percent, paying
40.3 million euros to small shareholders for 5.15 percent of the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
