Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , the
seller of  life insurance  and 401(k) plans, agreed to buy the
Mexican pension business of  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  as it expands in
the Latin American country.  The acquisition of HSBC Afore S.A. de C.V for $198 million
will add about 1.6 million customers, according to a statement
today from Des Moines, Iowa-based Principal. The deal may be
completed in the third quarter and includes an agreement with
HSBC to distribute retirement products through its more than
1,100 branches in the country, Principal said.  Principal, led by Chief Executive Officer Larry Zimpleman,
is looking to tap into a growing middle class in Mexico. The
deal would add $2.9 billion in pension holdings, according to
the statement. HSBC’s Mexican pension fund manages 52.9 billion
pesos ($4.5 billion) of assets, according to data on the website
of the country’s pension regulator, known as Consar.  “We expect continued growth at an even faster pace as
 Mexico ’s middle class continues to expand,” Luis Valdes,
president of Principal International, said in the statement.  HSBC’s pension funds were the fifth-best performer in
Mexico, with an average three-year return of 6.1 percent,
according to Consar. Mexican pension funds managed a total of
1.395 trillion pesos of assets in March.  Greenhill & Co. advised Principal on the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
