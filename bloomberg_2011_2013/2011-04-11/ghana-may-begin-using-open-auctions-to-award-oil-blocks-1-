Ghana  may end a practice of using
private negotiations between the Energy Ministry and  oil
companies  to award exploration blocks along its western coast
and begin auctioning rights publicly, according to a ruling
party legislator.  Other areas, which are little explored and are further from
the offshore Jubilee field, will continue to be awarded through
private negotiations, said  Moses Asaga , chairman of the mines
and energy committee in Ghana’s Parliament.  “We are going to have a hybrid regime,” he said in a
meeting in Accra. “If you are going to the Western region, that
is going to be through a bidding process. If you’re going to the
Accra region or the Volta region that will continue to be
through negotiations.”  Ghana’s western coast has seen a rise in offshore oil and
gas exploration since the 2007 discovery of the Jubilee field by
U.K.-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and its partners. The West African
nation has been attempting to increase onshore exploration,
especially in the Volta River basin in the east of the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
