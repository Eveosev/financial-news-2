British Columbia Investment
Management Corp. and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board
agreed to acquire Canadian lumber producer  TimberWest Forest
Corp. (TWF-U)  for C$910 million ($951 million).  Shareholders will receive C$6.48 for each of Vancouver-
based TimberWest’s so-called stapled units, the Canadian funds
said today in a joint statement. The transaction is valued at
C$1.03 billion including debt and represents a 25 percent
premium to the 20-day average price of TimberWest on the Toronto
Stock Exchange through April 8, the funds said.  “Timber and real estate exhibit inflation-hedging
characteristics and provide stable risk-adjusted returns,
attributes which are particularly well-matched to the needs of
pension plans,” the funds said in the statement.  TimberWest’s output of logs is mostly sold in British
Columbia, according to the company’s  website . It owns about
809,973 acres (327,678 hectares) of land on  Vancouver  Island.  The TimberWest units rose C$1.04, or 19 percent, to C$6.46
at 4 p.m. in Toronto trading. Each unit consists of one common
share and subordinated debt with a face value of about C$8.98,
according to the website.  The bid is less than TimberWest’s so-called net-asset value
of C$9.14 a unit and sum-of-the-parts valuation of C$13.61,
Richard Kelertas, a Montreal-based analyst at Dundee Securities
who has a “buy” rating on the company, said in a note.  “Unit holders should hold on to the stock for now as we
believe there will be a better offer coming soon,” he said.  There were 17 takeovers of forestry companies announced in
the year before today and the average value of those deals was
at least $112 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BMO Capital Markets advised TimberWest and UBS AG was an
adviser to a special committee set up by the company for the
deal, TimberWest said in a statement. McCarthy Tetrault LLP
acted as legal counsel to TimberWest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
