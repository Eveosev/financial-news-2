China ’s yuan traded near a 17-year
high after official data showed exports rose more than analysts
predicted last month.  The government reported yesterday that shipments increased
35.8 percent, compared with the median forecast of 23.4 growth
predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey. China will use
reserve-requirement ratios, interest rates and foreign-exchange
rates to “eliminate the monetary basis for inflation,” Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao said on April 9.  “Investors expect the currency to appreciate further as
the government has to rein in rising inflationary pressure,”
said Patrick Cheng, a foreign-exchange analyst at Haitong
International Securities Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “The prospect of
more interest-rate hikes provides support to a stronger yuan.”  The yuan was little changed at 6.5367 per dollar as of
10:02 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency touched 6.535 on April 8, the
strongest level since the country unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.03 percent
to 6.3685 per dollar in Hong Kong, reflecting bets the yuan will
gain 2.6 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  0.03 percent higher
at 6.5401 per dollar today, the strongest level since July 2005.
The currency is allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on either
side of the official rate.  Inflation Forecast  Inflation accelerated to 5.2 percent in March, exceeding
the government’s 2011 target of 4 percent, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey before official data
due on April 15.  The central bank has raised  interest rates  four times since
early October. Policy makers may continue to raise borrowing
costs because of rising prices, the China Securities Journal
reported today, citing Xia Bin, an adviser to the People’s Bank
of China.  “ China’s economy  would ultimately benefit from greater
appreciation” of the yuan,  Stephen Green , head of research for
greater China at Standard Chartered Plc in Shanghai, told
Bloomberg Television. Green predicted a “quicker” pace of
appreciation in the second quarter after a 0.9 percent gain in
the first three months of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
