GKN Plc (GKN) , the U.K. maker of aircraft
components for Airbus SAS, said first-quarter production and
profit was hurt by last month’s magnitude-9 earthquake in Japan.  The company’s automotive unit was affected by “component
supply problems” in Europe and  North America , while production
in Japan was “severely impacted.” The earthquake cost GKN’s
driveline unit about 3 million pounds ($4.9 million) in so-
called trading profit, the company said in a statement today.  Japanese carmakers plan to resume production in April and
May, and “it will be some time before the industry is in a
position to catch up on production lost through the first
half,” GKN said.  Toyota Motor Corp. said April 9 that it will cut output at
North American plants because of parts shortages caused by the
earthquake. Honda Motor Co. may need “significant” time to
repair a damaged research and development facility in Tochigi,
 Japan , Chief Executive Officer Takanobu Ito said April 8.  GKN’s trading profit for the three months to March 31 rose
to 119 million pounds from 84 million pounds a year earlier, the
Redditch, England-based company said. GKN defines trading profit
as operating profit before restructuring, sold businesses,
changes in valuation of financial instruments and amortization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
