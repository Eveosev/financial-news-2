OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas exporter,
may have record sales of 2.2 trillion rubles ($80 billion) in
 Europe  this year based on the Russian Economy Ministry’s price
forecast,  Vedomosti said , citing a ministry document and Denis
Borisov, an analyst at Bank of Moscow.  The amount would depend on the Ministry price prediction of
$383 per thousand cubic meters and Gazprom fulfilling a plan to
export 228 billion cubic meters of the fuel, the Moscow-based
newspaper said. The previous sales record for the European
market was 2 trillion rubles in 2008, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
