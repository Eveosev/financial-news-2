Crude oil from  Abu Dhabi  climbed
for a third day as increases in refiner’s processing profits
helped boost demand.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for June
loading gained 5 cents to a premium of 23 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Qatar Marine for the same period rose 10 cents to a premium of
11 cents a barrel above its benchmark, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Surging processing margins are causing refiners to raise
their rates, lifting demand for crude. Gasoil’s premium to
Dubai, a measure of profitability, climbed 71 cents to $23.67 a
barrel today, according to data from broker PVM Oil Associates
Ltd.  Oman oil for immediate loading increased $1.22, or 1
percent, to $118.75 a barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai for loading in June was up 1 percent at $118.27
and Murban crude climbed 1.1 percent to $122.34.  Oman futures for June delivery fell $1.20 to $118.58 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:08 p.m. Singapore
time, with 983 contracts traded. The settlement price was set at

to $7.97 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil Associates.
