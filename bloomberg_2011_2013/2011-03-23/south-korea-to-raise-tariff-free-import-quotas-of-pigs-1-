South Korea , battling outbreaks of
foot-and-mouth disease and bird flu, will increase tariff-free
import quotas of breeding pigs, chickens for breeding and seed
corn to ease a shortage and stabilize prices.  The government boosted the quotas for breeding pigs to
5,000 from 1,850 head and to 661,000 from 461,000 for breeding
chickens, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said in an e-
mailed statement today. The measures will start tomorrow and
last until the end of the year, statement said.  The Asian nation has culled about 3.5 million animals since
late November, mostly pigs and cattle, to contain the spread of
foot and mouth disease, the biggest outbreak in the nation’s
history. Separately, authorities have destroyed 6.2 million
chickens and ducks amid the outbreak of bird flu.  The increases will “help boost supplies of agricultural
and livestock commodities, stabilizing local prices,” the
ministry said. Prices of agricultural, dairy and fisheries goods
increased 17.7 percent in January and inflation has breached the
central bank’s target range for two straight months, climbing to
4.5 percent in February from a year earlier.  The quotas for tariff-free seed-corn was increased by 323
metric tons to 570 tons, while the 5-percent tariff quota for
soybeans for  food processing  increased by 141,018 tons to
326,805 tons, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
