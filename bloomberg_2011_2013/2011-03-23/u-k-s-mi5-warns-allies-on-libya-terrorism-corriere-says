The U.K.’s MI5 intelligence service
warned counterparts in North Atlantic Treaty Organization
countries of the risk of terrorist attacks following military
action in Libya,  Corriere della Sera  reported, without saying
how it got the information.  In a March 18 memo sent to agencies in other NATO
countries, MI5 cited wiretaps of Libyans living in the U.K.
which included discussions of “actions of support” for leader
 Muammar Qaddafi , Corriere said. Libyans in one call were quoted
as saying, “we should act where we are,” according to the
Milan-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
