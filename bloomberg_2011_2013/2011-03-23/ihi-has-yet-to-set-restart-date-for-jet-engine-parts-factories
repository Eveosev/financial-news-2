IHI Corp. (7013) , the Japanese maker of
components used in Rolls-Royce Group Plc and  General Electric Co. (GE) 
jet engines, said it hasn’t determined when it will restart two
parts factories shut after the March 11 earthquake.  Parts of buildings at the closed facilities in Soma,
Fukushima Prefecture were damaged in the quake, while
inspections showed the machinery in the plants wasn’t hurt,
Genki Yamamoto, a spokesman for the company, said by phone today.  IHI supplies fan modules and low-pressure shafts for the
V2500 jet engine used in Airbus SAS’s A320, turboshafts and
other parts for Rolls-Royce’s Trent 900 powerplant and about 15
percent of the parts used to make the GEnx engine for Boeing
Co.’s 787 Dreamliner. Aerospace accounted for about 22 percent
of IHI’s 1.2 trillion yen ($14.8 billion) in 2010 revenue, the
biggest contributor after energy and plants among businesses
that include shipbuilding, industrial machinery and logistics
facilities.  The closures follow the earthquake and tsunami centered off
the coast of Sendai, northern  Japan , adjacent to Fukushima
Prefecture. The disaster killed at least 9,408 people and
crippled a nuclear power plant in Fukushima, leading to electric
power shortages and concern radiation leaking from the plant may
reach harmful levels.  IHI gained 1.6 percent to 186 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The shares have dropped 12
percent since the day before the earthquake, compared with a 9
percent decline on the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
