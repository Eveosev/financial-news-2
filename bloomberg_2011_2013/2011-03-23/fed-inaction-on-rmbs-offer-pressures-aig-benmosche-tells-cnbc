American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s
plan to cut the U.S. Treasury Department’s stake faces pressure
because investors don’t know if the  Federal Reserve Bank of New
York  will sell the firm $15.7 billion in mortgage-backed
securities, Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  told CNBC.  AIG needs to boost investment income and can accomplish
that by repurchasing the securities it sold as part of its 2008
bailout, Benmosche told the station.  If the Fed doesn’t accept AIG’s offer, “the earnings
projection going forward will be lighter, which will put a
little pressure on the stock price,” he said. “Time is of the
essence. We want to get this behind us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
