Airline passengers will be able to
check in automatically by mobile phone by the end of the decade,
flight-reservations provider  Amadeus IT Holding SA (AMS)  said today.  Airports will adopt so-called near field communications-
technology incorporated in modern smartphones so that passengers
are checked in as soon as their presence is sensed at the
terminal, Amadeus said, citing research that it commissioned.  “As mobile platforms increase their penetration and self-
service technology continues to be adopted, the airlines may not
actually have human interaction with the passenger until they
are on board,” author Norm Rose said in the report, titled
“Navigating the Airport of Tomorrow.” Travelers will also be
able to track their luggage via their mobiles, he said.  Airline customers can already check in using mobile phones
by downloading barcodes which are then scanned by equipment at
the airport to permit boarding.  British Airways  made the service available via  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
iPhones,  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  BlackBerrys and phones using
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system last July and it’s
proving “very popular,” spokeswoman Sophie Greenyer said.  Juniper Research said yesterday that about 480 million
boarding passes, or one in seven, will be issued via phone by
2013, about three times last year’s total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
