Japan ’s 10-year bonds advanced for
a second day as stocks erased earlier gains, increasing demand
for the relative safety of government debt.  Two-year notes rose as bids climbed at an auction of the
securities after current-account deposits held by private
financial institutions at the Bank of Japan reached a record
yesterday. Gains in bonds were limited as the central bank
refrained from pumping emergency funds into the financial system
for a second day, after more than a week of injections to calm
markets following the nation’s biggest earthquake on March 11.  “Bonds are moving in tandem with stocks,” said  Katsutoshi Inadome , a strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s largest bank. “The auction’s
results were very strong. The BOJ has made aggressive moves,
while it was a surprise they took a pause.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell one basis
point to 1.20 percent at 3:11 p.m. in  Tokyo  at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
1.3 percent security maturing in March 2021 rose 0.089 yen to
100.845 yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery advanced 0.19 to
139.92 as of the afternoon close in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average slid 0.2 percent after rising as much as 0.6 percent.  Auction Results  Today’s sale of 2.6 trillion yen ($32 billion) in two-year
notes drew bids worth 4.77 times the amount on offer, up from a
ratio of 3.70 at the offering in February. The lowest price at
today’s auction was 99.935 yen, above the median forecast of
99.930 in a Bloomberg News survey of 14 traders.  The so-called tail, or the gap between the lowest and the
average price, was 0.004 yen, down from 0.007 at the prior sale.
The longer the tail, the less bids are around the average price.  Two-year yields fell a basis point to 0.205 percent.  The  Bank of Japan ’s 40 trillion yen of successive one-day
cash injections from March 14 to 22 helped to more than double
lenders’ deposits at the central bank to 41.8 trillion yen as of
yesterday. The central bank projects that those deposits will
increase to 42.6 trillion yen today.  “It seems the BOJ has injected enough liquidity to make it
through the end of the fiscal year” on March 31, said  Takafumi Yamawaki , chief rate strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
