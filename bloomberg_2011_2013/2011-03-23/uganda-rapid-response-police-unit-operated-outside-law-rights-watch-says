Members of  Uganda ’s rapid response
police unit frequently operated outside the law, carrying out
torture, extortion and extrajudicial killings, according to
 Human Rights Watch .  The unit should be investigated, the New York-based group
said in a report e-mailed today. The report cover the period
from November 2009 to January 2011, it said.  “The authorities and the donors who fund the police need
to get serious about holding abusive officers of this unit
accountable,” Daniel Bekele, the group’s Africa director, said
in the report.  Vincent Ssekate, the deputy spokesman for the police,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News by phone
and referred questions to spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba, who’s
phone was switched off.  To contact the reporter on this story:
