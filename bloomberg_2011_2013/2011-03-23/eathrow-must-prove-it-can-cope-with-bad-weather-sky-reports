BAA Ltd.’s inquiry into the snow-
related disruption at  London ’s Heathrow airport last December
has concluded that the airport will have to prove it can remain
operational in all but the most extreme conditions, Sky News
City Editor Mark Kleinman  reported  in his blog on the Sky
website, citing a person who has seen the report.  David Begg, a non-executive director at BAA, the airport
operator, will make 14 recommendations in the report as to how
Heathrow can better prepare for bad weather, including having
sufficient snow-clearing equipment available, simplifying
crisis-management procedures and improving communication
processes, Kleinman said. BAA will say it accepts all the
report’s guidelines, Kleinman said, without saying where he got
the information.  “The report will be published tomorrow morning,” and
“our response will follow,” a BAA spokeswoman said when
contacted by telephone outside office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
