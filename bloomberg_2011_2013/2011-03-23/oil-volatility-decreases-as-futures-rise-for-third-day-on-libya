Crude oil options volatility fell
as the underlying futures increased for a third day as the U.S.
and its allies prepared to attack Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s troops.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 32.4 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 34.5 percent yesterday.  Oil for May delivery gained 78 cents to $105.75 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since
Sept. 26, 2008. Oil also advanced as protesters clashed with
government forces in  Syria , bolstering concern supplies will be
disrupted.  “May $125 calls were going for about 30 to 35 cents today,
and thousands were purchased,” said Ray Carbone, president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York and a trader at the Nymex.
“There was a lot of speculative buying for May $120 and $125
calls. Volatility has been soft all week.”  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
May $110 calls with 3,276 lots changing hands. They fell 13
cents to $1.77 a barrel. June $130 calls, the next most active
contract, lost 7 cents to 81 cents a barrel with 2,031 contracts
trading. One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  May $120 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 8,366 lots changing hands. They gained 6 cents
to 54 cents a barrel. The next most active option, June $90
puts, tumbled 31 cents to 77 cents a barrel on 6,637 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
39,139 contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 38,977 and
June $150 calls with 38,968.  To contact the reporter on this story:
