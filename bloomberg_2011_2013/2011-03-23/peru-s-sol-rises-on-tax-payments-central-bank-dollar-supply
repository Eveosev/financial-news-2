Peru’s sol gained for a second day
on higher dollar flows from companies paying local taxes and as
central bank securities payable in U.S. currency expire.  The sol gained 0.2 percent to 2.7762 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:36 p.m. New York time, from 2.7814 yesterday.  Peruvian firms led by mining companies are selling dollars
to make annual tax payments in soles beginning March 25 through
the first week of April.  Central bank certificates of deposit payable and redeemable
in dollars expiring this week are adding to the supply of the
U.S. currency in the domestic market. The bank issued almost 800
million soles ($288 million) of 2-month certificates in January
to soak up excess dollars in the domestic market and ease gains
in the sol.  “As the central bank isn’t rolling them over, these are
dollars that will enter the market and go to the banks,” said
Ricardo Villamonte, head trader at Banco de Credito el  Peru , the
South American country’s largest bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
