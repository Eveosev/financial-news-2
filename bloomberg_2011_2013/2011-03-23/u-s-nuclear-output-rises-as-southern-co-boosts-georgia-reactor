U.S. nuclear-power output rose 0.8
percent as utilities increased production by reactors in
 Georgia ,  Pennsylvania  and  New Jersey , the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased by 662 megawatts from
yesterday to 85,184 megawatts, or 84 percent of capacity,
according to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Seventeen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Southern Co. (SO)  raised output at the 876-megawatt Edwin I.
Hatch 1 unit, 74 miles (119 kilometers) west of Savannah, to 99
percent of capacity from 84 percent yesterday. The 883-megawatt
Hatch 2 was operating at 97 percent of capacity.  Exelon raised power at the 1,134-megawatt Limerick 1 to 99
percent from 81 percent yesterday. The generating station is
about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia. Another reactor at the
site, the 1,134-megawatt Limerick 2, is operating at 90 percent
of capacity.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  boosted output from
the 1,061-megawatt Hope Creek 1 reactor to full power from 64
percent of capacity yesterday. The plant is about 18 miles south
of Wilmington, Delaware.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
