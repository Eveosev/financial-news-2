The  Carlyle Group ’s and Palamon
Capital Partners LP’s joint buyout of U.K.-based Integrated
Dental Holdings Plc and  ADP Dental Co. Ltd.  will get a
preliminary review from Britain’s antitrust regulator.  The joint venture’s purchase of Integrated from  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) ’s BAML Capital Partners and subsequent purchase of
ADP from London-based Palamon will be examined to see if the
deal creates a “relevant merger situation,” the U.K.  Office of
Fair Trading  said in a statement today.  “Should it be found to be a relevant merger situation, the
OFT will further consider whether” the transaction “may be
expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition”
in Britain, the watchdog said in the statement.  Carlyle, the Washington-based private-equity firm, and
Palamon plan to raise about 355 million pounds ($576 million) in
leveraged loans to back the purchase of Integrated, ING Groep NV
said in a statement last month. ING, Bank of Ireland, Lloyds
Banking Group Plc, and Societe Generale SA underwrote and
arranged the senior debt, according to the statement.  Rosanna Konarzewski, a London-based spokeswoman for
Carlyle, declined to comment. Palamon spokeswoman Annette Wilson
didn’t immediately return a call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
