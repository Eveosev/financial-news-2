South Korea ’s won slid for the
first time in four days as concern grew that Europe won’t find a
solution to its debt crisis and unrest continued in oil-rich
Libya.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday declined for the
first time in four days as crude oil futures for May delivery
climbed to the highest since March 10. Crude fell today. The
euro weakened for a second day on speculation European leaders
meeting this week will struggle to create a permanent solution
to the region’s debt crisis.  “We had a weaker session in U.S. equities and there’s also
renewed concerns developing in Europe, so that’s spilling over
to risk sentiment in Asia,” said  Thomas Harr , Singapore-based
head of Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Standard Chartered
Plc. “Still, it’s not a big move in the won.”  The won declined 0.3 percent to 1,124.35 per dollar at the
3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Crude rose as high as $105.38 per barrel earlier today.  Ten-year  government bonds  advanced, with the yield on the 5
percent note due June 2020 slipping one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.49 percent, according to prices from
Korea Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
