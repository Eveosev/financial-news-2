     March 24 (Bloomberg)-- David Kirby, author of the book 
Animal Factory, claims the US spends less than 1% on fruits and 
vegetables. Speaking on the Hays Advantage on Bloomberg Radio, 
Kirby says that amounts to 8 cents on every dollar, which is 
much less than what is spent on meat and dairy products.    (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 26:32  -0- Mar/23/2011 21:57 GMT
