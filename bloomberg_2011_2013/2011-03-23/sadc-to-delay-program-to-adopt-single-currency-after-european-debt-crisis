The  Southern African Development
Community  will review the 2016 deadline to create a monetary
union in the region and a 2018 plan to adopt a single currency,
Daniel Mminele, deputy governor of South Africa’s central bank,
said.  “Events of the recent past in  Europe  have prompted SADC to
examine more carefully the criteria for admittance to the
monetary union,” Mminele said in a copy of a speech posted on
the bank’s website today. This will “likely delay the eventual
establishment of the SADC central bank and the introduction of
the SADC single currency.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
