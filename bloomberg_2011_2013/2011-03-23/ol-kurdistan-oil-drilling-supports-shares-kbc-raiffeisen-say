Mol Nyrt.’s oil drilling results in
Kurdistan, conducted with Gulf Keystone Petroleum Plc., are
supportive of shares in  Hungary ’s biggest oil company, analysts
at KBC Securities and Raiffeisen Centrobank AG said.  “We see the test as a confirmation that MOL is sitting on
a massive reservoir in this deposit,” Peter Csaszar, analyst at
KBC Securities, said in an e-mailed note today. The test
supports KBC’s “buy” rating for the stock, Csaszar said.  Gulf Keystone and Mol announced yesterday that the crude
oil flow rate at the Shaikan-2 appraisal well in Kurdistan
reached 8,064 barrels a day and test conditions indicate that
higher rates can be achieved. Gulf Keystone holds an 80 percent
stake in the Shaikan exploration block and Mol has 20 percent.  The news is “positive and may support our bet that Mol
shares could remain outperformers,” said Akos Herczenik,
analyst at Raiffeisen in Budapest. Herczenik has a “buy”
rating for the stock with a price target of 26,815 forint.  Mol shares declined 30 forint, or 0.1 percent to 23,620
forint by 10:45 a.m. in Budapest, snapping two days of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
