Gasoline futures extended their
gains after the U.S. Energy Department reported inventories fell
more than twice as much as expected.  Stockpiles dropped 5.32 million barrels to 219.7 million,
the report showed. The median forecast of 16 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News was for a decline of 2 million barrels.  Gasoline demand increased 2.8 percent to 9.07 million
barrels a day. The four-week average was little changed at 9.065
million.  Gasoline for April delivery rose 1.45 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.019 at 10:33 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price, which settled yesterday at $3.0045, was
$3.0169 before the report was released at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
