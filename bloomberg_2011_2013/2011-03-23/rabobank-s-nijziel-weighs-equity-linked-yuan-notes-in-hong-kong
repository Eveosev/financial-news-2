Martijn Nijziel, head of global
financial markets for the Asia-Pacific region at Rabobank
International, comments on the market for yuan-denominated debt
in  Hong Kong . He spoke about so-called dim sum bonds in a March
21 interview in the city.  “Funding in the offshore market is much cheaper because so
much money is being stuck in the accounts here in Hong Kong now.
It has been driving yields to very low levels. Everybody is
hungry for assets in that market. Any bond launch has a high
likelihood of success at this point in time. We are also looking
at issuing equity-linked notes denominated in renminbi but that
will be stage two.”  Renminbi is an alternative name for  China ’s currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
