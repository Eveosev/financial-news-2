The pound weakened against the
dollar, yen and euro after minutes of the Bank of Englandâ€™s
March 10 meeting showed policy makers voted 6-3 to keep  interest
rates  on hold even as inflation accelerates.  Sterling weakened 0.3 percent to $1.6308 as of 9:41 a.m. in
 London , snapping a four-day advance. Against the Japanese
currency it lost 0.5 percent to 131.85 yen per pound while it
slid 0.3 percent to 86.97 pence versus the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
