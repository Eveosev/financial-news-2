Hundreds of flights were  canceled
today  from Chicago to  New York  as a wintry storm dropped snow
across the northern U.S. from Montana to the Atlantic.  Snowflakes coated trees in the New York City area, leaving
pavements wet for the morning commute. The snow was forecast to
change to rain by mid-morning, according to the  National Weather
Service .  “We’re not expecting a whole lot of accumulation for the
city, under an inch,” said  Joe Pollina , a weather service
meteorologist in Upton, New York. The rain is expected to change
back to snow and sleet overnight.  More than 560 flights were canceled as of 10 a.m. East
Coast time, most out of  Detroit , Chicago, Newark,  New Jersey ,
and New York, according to the FlightAware tracking service.
Traffic into Minneapolis-St. Paul International and  Chicago ’s
O’Hare was delayed about an hour, while at New York’s LaGuardia,
inbound flights were running about 90 minutes late, the Federal
Aviation Administration said on its  airport status website .  “Severe travel disruptions” were possible through the
Plains and the Upper Midwest, where heavy snow combined with
winds to reduce visibility and cover roads, according to
AccuWeather Inc.  As the storm moves east, as much as a foot (30 centimeters)
of snow may fall in the Poconos and Catskills, with 3 inches to
6 inches possible for southern New York State and northern
 Pennsylvania , AccuWeather said. Parts of New Jersey were
expected to get 1 to 3 inches of snow and sleet before the
system moves into southern  New England , the private forecaster
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
