Mozambique’s first coal shipments
are being delayed by problems completing the construction of the
Sena rail line linking the port of Beira with the Moatize coal
fields, Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique reported.  Exports by companies including  Vale SA (VALE3)  and  Riversdale
Mining Ltd. (RIV)  have been hindered by the delays, the Maputo-based
news agency said, citing Rosario Mualeia, chairman of the
southern African nation’s ports and rail authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
