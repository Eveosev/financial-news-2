Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , Europe’s second-
largest refiner by capacity, started a crude unit at its Trecate
plant in  Italy  following planned maintenance, according to a
company official.  The unit, which was halted in early February, was started
this week, said the official, declining to be identified because
the information hasn’t been made public.  The refinery, near Milan, can process 230,000 barrels of
crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Exxon,
based in Irving, Texas, has a 75 percent stake in the plant,
according to the company’s 2009 Financial and Operating  Review .
Italy’s ERG SpA holds the remaining shares.  Crude units are the primary processors in a refinery,
turning oil into fuels such as gasoline and diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
