The American Chamber of Commerce in
Ukraine, a trade group based in  Kiev , urged the Ukrainian
government to remove restrictions on the grains market and drop
export quotas.  The cabinet, led by Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov , “is
ignoring international commitments,” the group said in a letter
dated yesterday. The government is trying to monopolize and
“heavily interferes” in the grains and oilseeds markets, the
group said.  Ukraine set limits on grain exports in October in an effort
to curb domestic prices after a summer drought cut the harvest.
The current export limits of 4.2 million metric tons of grains
are in force until March 31.  Export quotas are an “exceedingly ill-targeted tool” for
trying to fight food-price inflation, said the chamber, a non-
governmental body that represents companies from  Europe ,  Asia ,
Russia and Ukraine as well as  North America . The government
hasn’t yet replied to the letter, Olha Lyuta, the chamber’s
spokeswoman, said today.  Ukraine is developing legislation that would allow only
producers and so-called state market operators to export grain.
Such a policy “seems to be designed to fully forbid activities
of trading companies,” the chamber said.  The cabinet approved a draft law setting export duties for
grains, agricultural researcher APK-Inform said today, citing
Mykola Markevych, head of the Association of Farmers and Private
Landowners. The duties would replace the wheat, barley and corn
export quotas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
