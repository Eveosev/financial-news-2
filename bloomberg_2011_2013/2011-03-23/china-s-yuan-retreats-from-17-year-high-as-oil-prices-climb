China ’s yuan fell, snapping a
three-day rally, as regional stocks declined on concern rising
 oil prices  will slow the global economic recovery.  The currency retreated from a 17-year high as the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of shares dropped for the first time in four days.
Crude has gained more than 4 percent this week on concern the
conflict in Libya will prolong supply disruptions. Asia’s
largest economy imported 54 percent of the oil it used in 2010,
according to the China Petroleum & Chemical Industry Association.  “The situation in Libya seems to be worsening and the
spike in oil prices has shown investors’ concerns on supply,”
said Edmond Law, deputy head of foreign exchange at BWC Capital
Markets in Hong Kong. “Stock markets in  Asia  retreat and the
yuan follows.”  The yuan slipped 0.05 percent to 6.5593 per dollar as of
the 4:30 p.m. close in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.5552 yesterday,
the strongest level since China unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  0.01
percent weaker at 6.5601 per dollar. The rate was fixed at
6.5592 yesterday, the strongest level since July 2005.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.12 percent to
6.4420 per dollar, reflecting bets the yuan will strengthen 1.8
percent in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
