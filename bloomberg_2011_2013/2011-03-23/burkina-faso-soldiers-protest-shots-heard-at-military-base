Ten people were injured after
soldiers at a military base in  Burkina Faso ’s capital,
Ouagadougou, protested against a court decision to sentence
officers involved in a dispute to prison, according to the
 Defense Ministry .  Several businesses were ransacked during yesterday’s
demonstration, Moussa Cisse, communication and press director of
the ministry, said in a statement read on state-owned radio and
television.  The ministry is in talks with the protesters to “normalize
the situation,” Cisse said. Five soldiers were sentenced to jail
terms March 22 following a dispute with civilians last month.  The Dakar-based West African Central Bank’s office in
Ouagadougou did not open today amid concerns over security
following the protests, said Issouf Sawadogo, head of the
institution’s communication office in  Burkina Faso .  “We’ll wait to see how the situation evolves” to decide on
whether to reopen, he said by phone. Some commercial lenders
also closed when they were unable to access money from the
 central bank  office, he said.  Ouagadougou’s main market was also closed following the
protests, said Seydou Zangre, president a network of
shopkeepers’ associations. The Gounghin district of the city
where the demonstrations took place was calm today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
