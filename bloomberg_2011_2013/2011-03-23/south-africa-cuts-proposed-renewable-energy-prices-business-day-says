The National Energy Regulator of
 South Africa  has cut the proposed amount the country will pay
for power generated from renewable sources until 2013, Business
Day reported, citing a consultation paper from the regulator.  The proposed so-called feed-in tariffs have been reduced to
0.95 rand ($0.14) per kilowatt hour of energy produced from wind
from 1.25 rand, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The
tariff for power from small hydro projects has been cut to 0.68
rand per kilowatt hour from 0.96 rand.  The rate for electricity from concentrated solar power
without storage was reduced to 1.96 rand a kilowatt hour from
2.09 rand while the tariff on photovoltaic power has been
reduced to 2.33 rand per kilowatt hour from 3.94 rand, the
newspaper said.  The tariffs were cut because of lower-than-expected
inflation and lower debt costs, Business Day said, citing
Charles Hlebela, a spokesman for the regulator.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
