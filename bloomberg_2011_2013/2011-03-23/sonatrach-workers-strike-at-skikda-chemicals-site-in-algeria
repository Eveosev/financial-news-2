Workers at Sonatrach’s chemicals
site in Skikda,  Algeria , are on strike in a dispute over wages,
potentially hampering distilled-water supply to a local
refinery, according to a union official.  “If the strike continues for another 10 to 12 days, then
work at the refinery may be disrupted,” Said Zair, head of the
local union, said yesterday by phone from the site. The risk of
a complete shutdown of the refinery is minimal as alternative
sources of distilled water are available, he said. The protest
began on March 13.  The refinery in the northeast of the country has the
capacity to process 320,000 barrels of crude oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The plant exports most
of its products to  Europe , the Middle East and  Africa .
Sonatrach, based in the capital Algiers, is the country’s state-
owned petroleum company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
