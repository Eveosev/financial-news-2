(Corrects Anglo’s holding in Kumba in final paragraph.)  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , a diversified
mining company, is seeking to acquire iron ore assets as the
price of the steelmaking raw material rises.  “We like iron ore and are determined to grow our iron ore
business,” James Harman, head of business development for
Anglo’s iron ore and coal unit, said today at a conference in
Perth,  Australia . “We remain on the lookout for quality iron
ore opportunities globally, including Australia.”  The London-based company joins Rio Tinto Group in studying
acquisitions to boost commodity production. Anglo, which is
spending about $17 billion to expand capacity, is seeking to
increase its annual iron ore output to 80 million metric tons by
2014 and 150 million tons by 2020, Harman said.  “We’re in a strong financial position, which will drive
this growth,” he said.  Annual profit more than doubled last year to $6.5 billion
after commodity prices rallied. Anglo is extending its Kumba
Iron Ore unit’s operations in  South Africa  and building the
Minas Rio iron ore mine in  Brazil  as demand from Asian steel
mills climbs. Anglo owns 65.3 percent of Kumba, the world’s
fourth-largest supplier of seaborne iron ore.  To contact the reporters on this story:
