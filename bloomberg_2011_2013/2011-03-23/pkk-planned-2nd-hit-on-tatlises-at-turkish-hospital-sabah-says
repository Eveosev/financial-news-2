Turkish police suspect that the
Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, ordered the shooting of
Ibrahim Tatlises, the country’s most popular singer, and planned
a second attempt on his life at a hospital where he’s
recovering, Sabah said.  Police found coded emails, notes and a floor plan of the
hospital at the house of a suspected member of the PKK who was
detained for allegedly ordering the shooting, Sabah said. The
PKK wanted Tatlises dead because he was getting too close to the
governing  Justice and Development Party , it said.   “Finish the job,” one of the notes said, the Istanbul-
based newspaper reported.   Tatlises, born in the mainly Kurdish southeast of  Turkey ,
was shot in the head as he left studios in Istanbul on March 13
and is in the intensive care unit of Acibadem hospital in
Istanbul’s Maslak district. The singer owns a restaurant chain
and a television production company.  The PKK has fought a two-decade war for political 
independence for the nation's 12 million Kurds at the cost of more
than 30,000 lives. It's labeled a terrorist group by the U.S. and
European Union.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
