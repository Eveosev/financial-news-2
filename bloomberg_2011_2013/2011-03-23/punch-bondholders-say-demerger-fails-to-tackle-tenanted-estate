Bondholders of  Punch Taverns Plc (PUB) ,
the owner of Chef & Brewer pub chain, said its plan to split
tenanted and managed outlets fails to address the need to turn
around performance at its tenanted estate.  “The review does nothing to address the issues in the
tenanted estate,” a spokesman for the Association of British
Insurers Special Committee of Bondholders said in an e-mailed
statement. “We remain concerned to see the real issues in the
operating businesses addressed fast.”  Punch said yesterday it plans to sell almost half of its
6,000 leased pubs and split itself into two separately listed
companies, one managed pub division and the other its leased
estates. Net debt at Punch reached 3.14 billion pounds ($5.1
billion), the company said in October.  “We have waited six months for the review to be conducted,
during which time operational performance in the leased estate,
where bondholders have 2.5 billion pounds at risk, has continued
to decline,” the spokesman, who declined to be identified, said
in the e-mail. “The review does nothing to address this key
issue of turning around the trading.”  Punch bondholders will hold a teleconference call at 4.30
p.m.  London  time tomorrow to discuss the company’s demerger
plan, the bondholder committee said today in a regulatory
statement.  A spokesman for Punch said the company didn’t want to
comment. He declined to be identified according to company
policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
