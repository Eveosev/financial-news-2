German chemical companies cut bonus
payments for managers in 2010 in a lingering effect of the
global recession, the VAA association of German chemical
companies said.  Bigger companies slashed bonuses by 16 percent, while
smaller companies granted less-than-average fixed-pay raises or
refrained completely from increasing fixed compensation, the
Cologne-based industry group said today in a statement. Total
pay for managers gained “slightly,” the VAA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
