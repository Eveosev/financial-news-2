The  Tokyo  Stock Exchange is
unlikely to list its shares this year, bourse president Atsushi Saito said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires, according
to the bourse’s spokeswoman.  “President Saito said in the interview that realistically
and due to a time schedule, going to public in this year may be
difficult,” Yukari Hozumi, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based
exchange, said. The bourse’s stance that it will be listed as 
soon as possible has not changed, Hozumi said.  Dow Jones Newswires reported earlier that the exchange’s
initial public offering is not likely to happen before the end
of this year, based on its exclusive interview with Saito.  Saito said on March 10 that the exchange would begin
preparations for an initial public offering after reporting
results for the year ending March 31. The bourse was interested
in acquiring Osaka Securities Exchange, which operates  Japan ’s
No. 2 equity and derivatives market, he said at the time.  Talks on the proposed merger could still “fall through,”
Dow Jones quoted Saito as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
