Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker operated by  Fiat SpA (F) , said it sued Allied Holdings Ltd.
in  Canada  to force the supplier to return 700 vehicles being
held at Allied facilities in Windsor, Ontario.  The lawsuit was filed in Ontario Superior Court, Chrysler
said in an e-mailed statement.  “Allied, one of Chrysler’s finished vehicle hauling
suppliers, made the decision to stop servicing us as well as
other” automakers, said Katie Hepler, a Chrysler spokeswoman.
“We have re-sourced the business to other suppliers and are
working to ensure a smooth transition.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
