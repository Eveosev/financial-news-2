A fire that broke out in an
Interior Ministry building in Cairo yesterday, injuring eight
people, was caused by electrical problems, according to a
statement from  Egypt ’s Cabinet.  The fire, which began after the army surrounded the
ministry to prevent protesting policemen from storming it, “was
not an act of sabotage,” the Cabinet said in the statement,
citing a ministry report presented to the government today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
