Discover Financial Services (DFS) , the
payments network whose stock has outperformed three larger
rivals, climbed to the highest in more than three years after
posting a record profit and boosting the dividend.  The shares gained $1.19, or 5.4 percent, to $23.44 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and earlier
touched $23.64, the highest since August 2007.  “Continuing one of the steadiest, surprise-free rebounds
we have seen in financials since the 2009 market lows, Discover
put up another impressive quarter,” Bruce Harting, an analyst
at Barclays Plc, said today in a note to clients. Harting, who
has an “overweight” rating on Discover, increased his 12-month
share-price estimate to $28 from $26.  Discover shares have gained 52 percent in the past year.
San Francisco-based  Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest payments
network, dropped 20 percent, and  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , based in
Purchase, New York, declined 0.5 percent. New York-based
 American Express Co. (AXP) , the third-biggest network and the biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases, climbed 9.2 percent.  Discover yesterday tripled its quarterly dividend to 6
cents a share as the Riverwoods, Illinois-based lender posted
net income of $465 million, a fiscal first-quarter record.  “We were able to do that because of our very strong
performance both on earnings and on total capital levels,”
Chief Executive Officer David Nelms, 50, said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
