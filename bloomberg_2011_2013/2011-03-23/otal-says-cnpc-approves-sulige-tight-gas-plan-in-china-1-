(Corrects price estimate fourth paragraph.)  Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest
oil company, said partner China National Petroleum Corp.
approved a plan to produce so-called tight natural gas from the
south Sulige field in  Inner Mongolia .  The project has been forwarded to China’s National
Development and Reform Commission for approval, Florent Segura,
a company spokesman, said by telephone today.  The French company has a 49 percent stake in the project
and CNPC’s PetroChina Co. is the operator with 51 percent
control, according to Total.  The initial investment in the project will be about $2
billion, French dailies  Les Echos  and  La Tribune  have reported.  The French oil and gas producer includes Sulige among a
dozen “major projects” slated to begin this year and next and
has forecast an estimated start of the Chinese field in 2013,
according to a February earnings presentation. The field has
proved and probable reserves of 440 million barrels of oil
equivalent and forecast production capacity of 50,000 barrels of
oil equivalent a day.  Total has reached agreements in recent years to develop oil
and gas fields with Chinese companies outside  China . It won a
stake in the contract for Iraq’s Halfaya oil field with CNPC and
has teamed up with China National Offshore Oil Corp. as partners
with Tullow Oil Plc to tap fields in the Lake Albert basin in
 Uganda .  To contact the reporter on this story:
