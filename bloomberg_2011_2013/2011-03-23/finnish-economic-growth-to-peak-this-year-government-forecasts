Finland ’s export-driven growth will
peak this year, before a slowdown in private spending weighs on
the economy of the northernmost euro member.  Gross domestic product will expand 3.6 percent this year,
before growth slows to 2.7 percent in 2012 and 2.4 percent in
2013, the Helsinki-based  Finance Ministry  said today in an e-
mailed statement.  This year’s forecast was raised from a December estimate
for 3.2 percent growth, while the forecasts for the next two
years were cut from 2.9 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.  The growth rates will be too slow to restore a  budget
surplus , the ministry said. The Nordic country will run deficits
every year until at least 2015 unless the government commits to
new measures to strengthen public finances, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
