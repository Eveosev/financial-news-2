Russia and  Japan  have halted
imports of poultry from  North Carolina  on disease concerns,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s  Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service .  Initial tests on a flock of turkeys in North Carolina came
back positive for low-pathogenic avian influenza, Lyndsay Cole,
a spokeswoman, said today in a telephone interview. Further
tests were unable to isolate the virus, signaling that this
isn’t a positive case, and there are no signs of disease in the
birds, Cole said.  “There are no clinical signs of avian influenza in this
flock,” Cole said. “We have no reason to believe that the
virus is present.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
