A pickup in inflation is a growing
threat to the U.S. economy and poses new challenges to Federal
Reserve policy makers, said economists  Vincent Reinhart  and
 Allan Meltzer .  “For the first time in a while, the Fed can see risks on
both sides” -- inflation and economic growth, Reinhardt, a
former adviser to Fed Chairmen Ben S. Bernanke and to his
predecessor Alan Greenspan, said today on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .  Reinhart said the Fed should reduce its purchases of U.S.
Treasury securities as it gauges the extent of price increases.  “If you see risk on both sides, then maybe you should go a
little slower,” he said. “I think they should cut the monthly
purchases to $25 billion,” about a third of the current $75
billion pace.  Meltzer, who has written a two-volume history of the
central bank, said “inflation is coming.” Although price
increases are currently “buried,” Meltzer said inflation
“will come out as soon as housing prices stop falling.”  Meltzer is a professor of political economy at  Carnegie
Mellon University  in Pittsburgh, and Reinhart is a resident
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.  To contact the reporters on this story:
