Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) 
offered customers in  Japan  the opportunity to delay deliveries
of the metal while they recover from the impact of a March 11
earthquake, Business Day reported.  None of Impala’s customers in Japan, which include
carmakers, took the company up on its offer, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper said, citing Marketing Executive Derek
Engelbrecht. Japan accounts for about a third of Impala’s annual
metal sales, Engelbrecht said, according to Business Day.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
