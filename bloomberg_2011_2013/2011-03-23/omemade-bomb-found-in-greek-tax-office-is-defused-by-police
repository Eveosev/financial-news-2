A homemade explosive device was
found and defused in an Athens-based tax office,  police  said.  No injuries or damage was caused by the bomb, which was
found earlier today in the area of Neos Kosmos in  Athens , a
police spokeswoman said by telephone.  An anonymous warning call was made to the newspaper
 Eleftherotypia , the spokeswoman added. No one has claimed
responsibility for the attack.  Small-scale bomb and incendiary attacks are common in
 Greece  and have increased since the fatal police shooting of a
teenager in December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
