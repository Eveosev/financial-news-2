U.S. ethanol production climbed 2
percent to 913,000 barrels a day last week, the highest level in
two months, according to the Energy Department.  Output rose to the highest level since Jan. 21 and the gain
was the largest since Jan. 14, the department said in a report
released in  Washington . Stockpiles grew 0.7 percent to a record
20 million barrels.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
gained 0.9 percent to 4.95 million barrels a day. Refiners
receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended
into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery slumped 0.8 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.48 a gallon at 10:35 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have climbed 59 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
