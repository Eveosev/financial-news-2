AirTran Holdings Inc. (AAI) ’s
shareholders approved the $1.4 billion cash-and-stock buyout
offer from  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) , moving the carriers closer to
completing their tie-up.  About 78 percent of outstanding shares were voted, with
almost 99 percent of those favoring the transaction, Orlando,
Florida-based AirTran said today in a statement.  The combination will give Southwest flights into Atlanta,
the world’s busiest airport and the hometown hub of Delta Air
Lines Inc., for the first time. AirTran agreed to be bought by
Southwest in September.  Southwest also will gain control of the smaller carrier’s
fleet of 138 Boeing Co. jets. Southwest, which flies only Boeing
737s, will take on a second aircraft type with AirTran’s smaller
Boeing 717s.  Atlanta is AirTran’s biggest hub, representing about half
of its flights with 360 takeoffs and landings a day, followed by
 Orlando , Baltimore-Washington and Milwaukee.  Southwest, based in  Dallas , is the fourth-largest U.S.
carrier by passenger traffic and had $12.1 billion in sales last
year. AirTran is 10th-biggest in the U.S. and had 2010 revenue
of $2.62 billion.  The deal value is based on Southwest’s closing price
yesterday of $12.32 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. That’s little changed from its $12.28 close on Sept.
24, the last trading day before the acquisition was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
