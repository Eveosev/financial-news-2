Hungary ’s budget deficit, which
reached 81.4 percent of the full-year goal in February, may peak
in the middle of the year, according to Beno Peter Banai, deputy
state secretary at the Economy Ministry.  Revenue from extraordinary industry taxes and the effective
nationalization of private pension funds will flow into the
budget in the second half of the year, especially near the end
of 2011, Banai said in comments posted on the ministry’s
website.  Hungary, which targets a budget shortfall of 2.94 percent
of economic output this year, is relying on extraordinary taxes
on energy, finance, retail and telecommunication companies as
well as on pension fund portfolios to make up for lost revenue
from the introduction of a flat personal income tax and the
reduction of the corporate  tax rate .  The government earlier this month unveiled spending-cut
plans for the next three years to make budget financing
sustainable and avert having its  credit rating , currently the
lowest investment grade at all three major rating companies,
being lowered to junk.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
