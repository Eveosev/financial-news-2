Former  Portugal  soccer coach Carlos Queiroz had a six-month ban for making “sexually descriptive”
comments about an anti-doping official’s mother overturned, the
top sports tribunal said.  The Lausanne, Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for
Sport said in a written ruling today that while Queiroz’s
behavior was “unacceptable” he did not disturb the collection
of samples from Portugal players.  Queiroz was abusive toward officials when they arrived
unannounced at a hotel in Covilha, Portugal, in May last year as
the national team was preparing for the  World Cup , the ruling
said. Queiroz didn’t dispute his comments were inappropriate,
the ruling said.  “Following a discussion, the anti-doping officers left to
continue the anti-doping control and, as he was walking away,
Mr. Queiroz uttered some very distasteful and sexually
descriptive comments” about the head of the Portuguese anti-
doping agency’s mother, the ruling said.  Queiroz is a former Real Madrid coach and assistant to
Manchester United manager  Alex Ferguson . He was fired as
national team coach on Sept. 10 a week after he received the
six-month ban from the Portuguese agency.  Portugal lost to eventual champion Spain in the round of 16
of last year’s World Cup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
