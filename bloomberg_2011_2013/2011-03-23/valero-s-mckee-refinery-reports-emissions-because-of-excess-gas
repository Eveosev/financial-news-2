Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  reported
emissions at its McKee refinery in  Texas  because of excess
hydrogen sulfide in refinery fuel gas yesterday.  The refinery implemented a “sulfur shedding plan”
according to a  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. Emissions occurred yesterday between 10 a.m. and 10
p.m. local time and were associated with a reformer and the No.
2 crude unit, the company said in the filing.  Valero plans to expand crude capacity at its McKee refinery
in Texas by 25,000 barrels a day over the next three years, the
company announced earlier this month. The expansion will
increase the refinery’s daily capacity to 195,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
