Cree Inc. (CREE) , a maker of energy-
efficient lighting products, fell to the lowest in 17 months
after it cut its revenue forecast as demand for LED parts slows.  Cree fell as much as 12 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since Jan. 19, to $43.16 at 1:11 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading. Cree dropped to its lowest price since
Nov. 4, 2009.  Cree expects revenue of $215 million to $220 million for
the quarter ending March 27, down from a January forecast of
$245 million to $265 million, the company said today in a
statement. Analysts estimate third-quarter sales of $255.7
million.  “Two thirds of the miss comes from its lighting components
segment in which we believe Cree is the share leader,” said
Ahmar Zaman, analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co. in a research note
today. Zaman has had an “overweight” recommendation on the
company since July.  Pricing for light-emitting diodes, which are increasingly
used in televisions and computer monitors for backlighting, and
used in iPhones and other mobile devices, is lower than it had
previously forecast and demand is weak, Cree said. LED products
accounted for more than 90% of total revenue in fiscal year
2010.  Prices in the quarter ending in June will be similar to
where they are today, which is a “very aggressive pricing
environment,” Charles Swoboda, president and chief executive
officer of Cree said on a conference call today. “So we’re not
assuming it gets worse but also not assuming it gets better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
