Angola ’s government dropped its
support for  Ivory Coast ’s incumbent leader  Laurent Gbagbo ,
further isolating him in a dispute over election results.  Angola brought its position in line with the African Union,
which has called for a unity government led by  Alassane Ouattara , the internationally recognized winner of the Nov. 28
vote, Foreign Minister George Chikoty said yesterday on
Televisao Publica de Angola, the Luanda-based state-owned
broadcaster.  In January, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
called for new elections in Ivory Coast after saying the  United
Nations  misled the international community when it validated
electoral commission results handing Ouattara victory. The U.S.,
European Union and most African countries backed the UN
position.  South Africa , which had declared its neutrality in the
dispute, recognized Ouattara this month as the winner of the
election. An African Union-appointed panel found Ivory Coast’s
Constitutional Court abused its authority when it annulled
results from northern voting districts, stripping Ouattara of
victory, President Jacob Zuma told lawmakers in Cape Town on
March 17.  Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, is on the
brink of civil war, with clashes between forces loyal to the
rival leaders intensifying over recent weeks.  The  UN Mission in Ivory Coast  said yesterday that Gbagbo’s
backers were making repairs to an attack helicopter and readying
heavy weapons. The use of those weapons would not be tolerated,
the mission said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
