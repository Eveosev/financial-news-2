Over-the-counter heartburn drugs
such as  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) ’s Prilosec and  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s
Prevacid don’t increase the risk of broken bones, U.S.
regulators said, reversing a decision announced a year ago.  Short-term use of low-dose proton pump inhibitors sold
without a prescription “is unlikely” to lead to hip, wrist and
spine fractures, the Food and Drug Administration  said  today.
The agency said in May that over-the-counter and prescription
heartburn drugs would need new warnings about broken bones.  Patients at highest risk for fractures took high doses of
prescription heartburn and acid-reflux treatments or used the
drugs for at least a year, the FDA said today. Over-the-counter
versions are intended for 14-day use up to three times a year
and the risks may increase if these medicines are taken more
often.  “FDA acknowledges that consumers, either on their own, or
based on a healthcare professional’s recommendation, may take
these products for periods of time that exceed the directions on
the OTC label,” the agency said in its notice.  Novartis, of Basel, Switzerland, sells Prevacid over the
counter under a license from Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., of
Osaka,  Japan . Prilosec, sold by Cincinnati-based P&G, contains a
chemical similar to the key ingredient in Nexium, the leading
prescription heartburn drug sold by London-based  AstraZeneca
Plc. (AZN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
