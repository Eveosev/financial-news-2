The Navy won’t buy specific
replacements from  Raytheon Co. (RTN)  for 162  Tomahawk cruise missiles 
that were fired at Libyan air defenses in the opening days of
the U.S.-led coalition’s campaign to set up a no-fly zone.  “The Tomahawks that were shot are part of our current
inventory; there are more than ample replacements for those,
more than ample,” Admiral Gary Roughead, the chief of naval
operations, told reporters in  Washington . The Navy has more than
3,000 Tomahawks, he said.  The opening rounds of the coalition action, named Operation
Odyssey Dawn, followed the script of major operations since 1991
with the launch of Raytheon Tomahawk missiles to destroy air
defenses and clear a path for manned aircraft.  The first strikes on March 19 involved 124 missiles against
more than 20 targets, and thirty-eight additional missiles were
fired later. By contrast, 288 Tomahawks were fired in the 1991
 Gulf War .  The Navy’s current five-year budget plan through 2016
projects buying 980 of the newest Tactical Tomahawks. Each
missile costs about $1.4 million in today’s dollars, according
to the Navy. Raytheon’s Tucson, Arizona-based missile unit makes
the weapon.
      The Tactical Tomahawk  is guided by global positioning
system coordinates and is capable of loitering over a target and
receiving new targeting information in flight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
