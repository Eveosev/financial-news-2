Vietnamese two-year  government
bonds  fell, pushing yields to a ten-month high, on speculation
prices will rise this month. The dong declined.  Consumer prices may rise 2.2 percent in March from February,
Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung said March 21. Inflation
accelerated to 12.3 percent in February from a year earlier. The
central bank raised borrowing costs for the third time in as
many weeks on March 8.  “Clearly people are expecting reasonably high inflation
this month and maybe for the coming months,” said Francois Chavasseau, head of fixed-income research at  Sacombank
Securities Joint-Stock Co.  in  Ho Chi Minh City .  Yields on two-year bonds rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 11.55 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was the highest
since May 10.  Vietnam ’s State Treasury will offer 1 trillion dong ($48
million) each of five- and 10-year bonds at an auction tomorrow,
the  Hanoi Stock Exchange  said in a statement on its website
yesterday. Investors waiting for the sale contributed to yields
on those maturities staying unchanged for a third day,
Chavasseau said.  The dong weakened 0.2 percent to 20,893 per dollar as of
4:17 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,688, compared with
20,683 yesterday, according to its website. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Nicholas Heath. Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact the reporter on this story:
