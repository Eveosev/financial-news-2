European Union regulators are
seeking views on changes to rules for how governments can fund
public services, such as transport and broadcasting, the
European Commission said today.  The EU’s antitrust agency must approve large subsidies from
states to companies and can demand repayment if its
rules aren’t followed. It said it will publish details of
planned changes in July and the new rules would take effect in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
