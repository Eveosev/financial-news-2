A group of  Punch Taverns Plc (PUB) 
bondholders, including  Aegon NV (AGN) , Aviva Plc,  Blackrock Inc. (BLK) ,
 Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN) , M&G and  Standard Life Plc (SL/) , said the
company’s plan to spin off its managed pubs business into a
separately listed entity won’t address financial challenges at
its tenanted pubs unit, the Financial Times reported, citing the
group.  The plan “does nothing to address the issues in the
tenanted estate and is a ‘walkaway’ from them,” the  Association
of British Insurers , commenting on behalf of the bondholders,
said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
