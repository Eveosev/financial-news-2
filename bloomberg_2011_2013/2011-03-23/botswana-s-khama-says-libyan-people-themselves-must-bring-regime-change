Botswana President Ian Khama said
the “most we can hope for” in  Libya , led by President  Muammar
Qaddafi , is that regime change is brought about by the people of
the country themselves.  The United Nations Security Council’s resolution calling
for a no-fly zone over Libya is “well intended” and should be
supported by all countries, Khama said in a speech today in
Gaborone, the capital.  “The least we can hope for from this intervention is the
intended protection from brutality, leading to death in many
cases, of Libyan citizens opposed to Qaddafi and his
dictatorship,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
