Platmin Ltd. (PPN)  will buy a South
African platinum resource as it develops mines at the site of
the world’s richest reserves.  Platmin will buy about 6 million inferred resource ounces
of platinum group metals at the Sedibelo West project for $75
million from the Bakgatla-Ba-Kgafela tribe, the Pretoria-based
company said in a statement today.  Platmin is building output at  Pilanesburg , its first mine,
to about an annual 250,000 ounces of platinum group metals next
year and also studying the potential of the nearby Magazynskraal
project. Sedibelo West borders Pilanesburg and all three are on
the Bushveld geological complex, holder of the richest reserves.  Executives are “planning how this entire area might be
consolidated,” Platmin Chairman Brian Gilbertson said in an
interview at the mine today. Today’s deal is “the first step in
that consolidation process,” he said, declining to elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
