South Africa  sees “other ways” of
resolving a dispute with  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  over a 21.4 percent
share of the country’s Sishen mine, The Times reported, citing
Rob Davies, the minister of trade and industry.  South Africa would prefer to find a solution “in
conjunction” with Kumba, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited
Davies as saying. It didn’t give any further information.  South Africa awarded the Sishen right to Imperial Crown
Trading 289 Ltd. in March last year after it reverted to the
state from  ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL)  Kumba, which also
applied for the right, is challenging the decision in court.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
