Czech, a car venture formed by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and PSA
Peugeot Citroen, said pretax profit was little changed last year
as cost cuts helped to offset a production decline.  The pretax figure was “just under” 1.4 billion koruna
($81 million), compared with 1.4 billion koruna in 2009, the
carmaker, based in Kolin,  Czech Republic , said. Revenue declined
16 percent to 44.7 billion koruna.  “We managed to maintain good financial results even though
the number of vehicles produced fell 11 percent as scrapping
incentives ended,” TPCA President Satosi Tacihara said at a
press conference in Prague today. The company expects a return
to production growth in 2012, the executive said.  TPCA makes Toyota Aygo, Peugeot 107 and Citroen C1 compact
cars, an area of the market least affected by the global
slowdown. The company was hit last year by the end of scrapping
incentives in some European Union countries.  TPCA’s factory assembled 295,712 vehicles last year, 11
percent fewer than in 2009, the company said in a statement. It
expects to produce a similar number this year, Tacihara said at
the press conference.  The venture has no difficulties with suppliers as a result
of the Japanese earthquake “at this moment,” according to
Tacihara. The situation is monitored continuously, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
