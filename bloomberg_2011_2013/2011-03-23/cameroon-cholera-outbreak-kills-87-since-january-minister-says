Cholera, a bacterial infection that
spreads through contaminated water and food, killed 87 people in
 Cameroon  since January, according to the countryâ€™s public health
minister, Andre Mama Fouda.  Since the outbreak began in May, 744 people have died, he
said in a statement handed to reporters yesterday.  The outbreak claimed 28 lives in the port city of Douala
this year and 27 in Yaounde, the capital, this year. In 2010,
the northern part of the country was hardest hit, according to
Fouda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
