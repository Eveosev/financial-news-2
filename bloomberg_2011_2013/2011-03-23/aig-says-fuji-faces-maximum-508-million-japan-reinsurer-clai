American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer bailed out by the U.S., said its Fuji Fire & Marine
Insurance Co. faces a maximum of $508 million in claims through
the Japanese Earthquake Reinsurance Co. in connection with the
March 11 temblor.  “The total net JERC losses that Fuji Fire and Marine
actually incurs in connection with the  Japan  earthquake will
flow through AIG’s income statement,” the New York-based
company said today in a statement. “AIG expects minimal net
effects on the statutory capital and liquidity of its local
Japanese operations.”  Fuji fire has catastrophe reserves of $482 million, meaning
the maximum additional cash payment to the JERC is $26 million,
the company said. AIG said last week that the quake and
subsequent tsunami cost the firm about $700 million, excluding
obligations to the JERC. AIG also faces about $300 million in
costs from other first-quarter disasters including floods in
 Australia  and a quake in  New Zealand .  AIG is increasingly reliant on property-casualty operations
after selling its biggest non-U.S. life businesses to help repay
a $182.3 billion bailout. The company is adding to investments
in Japan with the planned purchase of the 45 percent of Fuji
Fire that it doesn’t already own.  AIG declined 40 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $36.55 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
has dropped 24 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
