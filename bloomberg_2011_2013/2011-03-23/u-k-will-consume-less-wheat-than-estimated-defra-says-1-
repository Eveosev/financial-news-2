Annual U.K. wheat consumption will
be lower than previously estimated as less grain is used for
industrial purposes and feeding animals, the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  Wheat consumption will come to 14.1 million metric tons in
the marketing year that began July 1, 2.6 percent less than
estimated in January, Defra said in a  report  today. Predicted
usage in human and industrial products fell 3.7 percent and
wheat used as  animal feed  dropped 1.5 percent, it said. Supply
will remain at 17.8 million tons, the report showed.  “The decrease is a result of lower estimated demand levels
from the flour-milling industry, the brewers, maltsters and
distillers sector, and U.K. bioethanol producers,” Defra said.
“For bioethanol, planned outage has lowered the expected usage
in the sector, while survey data for both flour millers and the
brewers are showing lower usage levels than expected.”  Feed wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in  London  is down 3.5
percent this year, partly on speculation world production will
increase and stockpiles will rise. Global wheat output is set to
gain 3.4 percent to 676 million tons in 2011, the  United
Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization   said  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
