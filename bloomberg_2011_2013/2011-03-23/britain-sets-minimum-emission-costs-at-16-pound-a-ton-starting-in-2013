The U.K. fixed the levy its
utilities will have to pay on every ton of carbon dioxide they
emit in 2013 at 4.94 pounds ($8.02), indicating their costs will
exceed what they spend on European Union emission allowances.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  announced a so-
called carbon-price support in his annual budget presentation
today in London. While he said the floor price will be 16
pounds, documents released later in the day showed the Treasury
will charge utilities a tax of 4.94 pounds a ton.  Drax Group Plc (DRX) 
and other utilities fell today in London trading.  “From 1 April 2013, the carbon price support rates for the
Climate Change Levy, and in the case of oils, fuel duty, will be
equivalent to 4.94 pounds per ton of carbon dioxide,” according
to the  document  released today by the Treasury. The government
fixed the 2013 levy at 4.94 pounds based on prices over the last
12 months for carbon futures for delivery in 2013, according to
an e-mail sent today by a Treasury spokesman who declined to
give his name, citing government policy.  The minimum paid by U.K. electricity producers, including
the levy, will rise to 30 pounds a ton by 2020, Osborne said.
The Treasury documents forecast that the U.K. carbon levy may
rise to 7.28 pounds a ton in 2014 and 9.86 pounds in 2015. The
levy will encourage investors to finance construction of five
nuclear reactors in Britain and will reduce utility emissions by
263 million metric tons through 2030, according to Treasury
estimates.  The new carbon tax is designed to replace an existing levy
established by the Labour party in 2000 that taxes all energy,
regardless of how much CO2 is emitted. Producers and consumers
of power from fossil fuels criticized the new U.K. plan.  Negative for Utilities  “It is negative for all fossil-fuel generators in the
U.K.,” said Elaine Coverley, a utilities analyst at Brewin
Dolphin Ltd. in  London . “Drax is the worst affected as a 100
percent coal generator.  Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE) ,  Centrica
Plc (CNA)  and International Power Plc would all be affected to a
lesser extent.”  Scottish & Southern, Britain’s second-biggest power
producer, dropped 25 pence, or 2 percent, to 1,207 pence in
London trading. Centrica retreated 2.6 percent to 317.6 pence,
while Drax, owner of western Europe’s largest coal-fired power
plant, fell 4.3 percent to 392.2 pence.  The new U.K. fee is linked to prices in the EU’s emission
trading system, the world’s largest cap-and-trade program. EU
permits for 2013 rose 0.4 percent to 18.86 euros ($26.62) a
metric ton on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  Raising Revenue  The U.K.’s carbon floor price will raise 3.2 billion pounds
over the three tax years beginning in 2013, the Treasury said
today in  documents posted  on its website. After adjusting for
lower emissions that the tax is designed to encourage, it is
projected to raise 740 million pounds in the tax year ending in
2014, 1.07 billion pounds in 2015 and 1.41 billion pounds in
2016, the U.K. documents show.  Britain gets about 80 percent of its power from fossil
fuels, with the rest from nuclear and a small portion from
renewable such as biomass and wind power. Coal and natural gas
emit carbon-dioxide when burnt, while emissions from nuclear
plants are negligible.  Drax, Britain’s largest single source of CO2 via its 4,000-
megawatt coal-fed power station in Selby, northern  England , said
the carbon tax “may distort the competitive market and deliver
detrimental unintended consequences.”  ‘Very Difficult’  Carbon costs exceeding 25 pounds start making coal-fed
power stations “very difficult,” Andy Cox, an energy partner
at  KPMG , the accounting firm said by telephone. The policy
“certainly feels weighted toward building new nuclear and will
put upward pressure on prices,” for electricity, he said.  Wholesale power prices may increase 5 pounds to 6 pounds a
megawatt hour, or 10 percent by 2020, Duncan Sinclair, director
at the London-based Redpoint Energy, said today by e-mail. The
higher costs will have “a significant impact” on utility
earnings, he said. “Coal and older, less efficient gas plant
will be hit by higher carbon costs, potentially accelerating
closure,” he said.  Britain becomes the first country to “unnecessarily expose
the manufacturing sector to unilateral cost increases,” Gareth
Stace, head of climate and environment policy at the EEF
manufacturers group, said by telephone from London.  Electricite de  France  SA, the Paris-based company that is
the biggest power generator in both the U.K. and France, said
the carbon tax “strikes the right balance,” giving investors
confidence to invest in atomic reactors and other low-carbon
generation. The company owns eight of Britain’s 10 nuclear power
stations and plans four additional reactors in the country by
2025. Construction of the first one is set to start in 2013.  “For nuclear, helping to restore the carbon price to what
was originally intended is important to encourage investment in
existing plants and in new build,” EDF’s U.K. Chief Executive
Officer Vincent de Rivaz said in an e-mailed statement.  Analysts including Deutsche Bank AG forecast that the EU
carbon price will rise to 30 euros by the end of this decade.
That’s below the U.K. tax, so would it would require Britain’s
fossil-fuel power generators to pay additional tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
