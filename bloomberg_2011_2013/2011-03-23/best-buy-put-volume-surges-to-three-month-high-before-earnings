Best Buy Co. put volume surged to a
three-month high after a trade with a strike price 5.8 percent
above yesterday’s close before the world’s largest consumer-
electronics retailer reports earnings tomorrow.  Investors bought a block of 13,000 April $30 puts to sell
the retailer’s shares for 93 cents each at 10:49 a.m. in New
York, according to a report by options strategists at
Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP in  Bala Cynwyd ,  Pennsylvania ,
and data compiled by Bloomberg.  “These investors appear to expect higher levels of
volatility following the earnings release,” the Susquehanna
strategists wrote.  More than 50,400 puts changed hands today, more than seven
times the four-week average. The April $30 puts were the most
active and accounted for more than a third of all put volume.
Open interest for those contracts was 3,967 before today.
Richfield, Minnesota-based Best Buy gained 1.4 percent to
$31.85.  The retailer will post fourth-quarter earnings of $1.84
cents a share excluding some items, according to the average of
22 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Best Buy, which fell 23
percent in the past year versus a 16 percent gain for companies
that are dependent on  consumer spending  in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index, missed analysts’ estimates in December and tumbled 15
percent the day of the report.  Implied Volatility  Best Buy’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to
38.82 from 36.47 yesterday.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  today recommended that investors
who own Best Buy stock sell June $33 calls before the earnings
release and the April 14 investor day because the “longer term
outlook remains at risk.”  “Our analyst expects earnings on March 24 to be a modest
catalyst, yet options imply a much larger move,” derivatives
strategists Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall wrote in a
note, citing retail analyst Matthew Fassler, who has a
“neutral” stock rating on the company and on March 21
decreased the forecast price to $36 from $38.  For investors who do not own Best Buy, the strategists
recommended buying one April $32 call and selling two April $35
calls in a spread strategy that will profit if the stock closes
between $32.63 and $37.37 at expiration on April 15, the note
said.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
