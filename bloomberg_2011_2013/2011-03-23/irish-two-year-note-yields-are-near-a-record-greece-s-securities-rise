Irish two-year government notes
declined for a third day, leaving the yield near the highest on
record. Greek two-year notes rose.  The Irish two-year yield rose six basis points to 9.93
percent as of 7:43 a.m. in  London , after climbing yesterday to
as high as 10.18 percent, the most since at least 2003, when
Bloomberg started collecting the data.  Greece â€™s two-year yield dropped two basis points to 14.89
percent, while that on similar maturity Spanish notes was little
changed at 2.90 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
