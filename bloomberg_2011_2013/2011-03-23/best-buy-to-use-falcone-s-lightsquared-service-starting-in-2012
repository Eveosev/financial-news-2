Billionaire Philip Falcone’s
LightSquared Inc. said it will provide wireless service to Best
Buy Co., the second customer in as many days for the venture
that’s building out a network to challenge larger rivals.  Retailer Best Buy’s Connect mobile-broadband service will
begin testing LightSquared’s network in next year’s first
quarter, LightSquared Chief Executive Officer Sanjiv Ahuja said
today at a mobile-industry conference in  Orlando , Florida.  LightSquared, backed by billionaire Falcone’s Harbinger
Capital Partners hedge fund, is seeking to compete with AT&T
Inc.,  Verizon Wireless  and  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  in selling so-called
fourth-generation wireless service that offers faster Internet
browsing. Yesterday, pay-as-you-go carrier Leap Wireless
International Inc. announced an agreement with LightSquared.  Falcone has committed billions to take on LightSquared’s
larger and more established rivals, and faces government
deadlines for building out his network. Falcone agreed last year
to Federal Communications Commission conditions that his service
cover as many as 100 million people in the U.S. by the end of
2012 and 260 million by 2016.  Ahuja said today Reston, Virginia-based LightSquared plans
to spend $14 billion on its network over the next eight years.
Last month, the company announced $586 million in new funding
from UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. that will help its network
buildout. The company has about $1 billion in cash on hand, two
people familiar with the matter said Feb 18.  LightSquared has said it has agreements with five customers
to provide wholesale 4G service, including two carriers, a
national retailer, a device manufacturer and a website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
