Marty Schottenheimer, who is sixth
on the  National Football League ’s all-time coaching wins list,
will return to the sidelines this year in the United Football
League.  Schottenheimer, 67, was named coach and general manager of
the Virginia Destroyers, the UFL’s new franchise, the league
said today in a statement. The Virginia Beach, Virginia-based
Destroyers are the successors to the Florida Tuskers, who ceased
operations after making the UFL championship game in each of the
league’s first two seasons.  Schottenheimer has not coached since being fired by the  San
Diego Chargers  following a 14-2 season in 2006. In 21 years as a
head coach with the Cleveland Browns,  Kansas City Chiefs ,
Washington Redskins and Chargers, Schottenheimer made the
playoffs 13 times. His 200 career NFL regular season wins are
most for a coach without reaching the  Super Bowl . He was less
successful in the playoffs, compiling a 5-13 record.  Founded in 2009, the UFL will start its third season this
fall. Schottenheimer is now the fourth former NFL coach in the
five-team league, joining Jim Fassel, Jerry Glanville and Dennis Green.  To contact the reporter on this story:
