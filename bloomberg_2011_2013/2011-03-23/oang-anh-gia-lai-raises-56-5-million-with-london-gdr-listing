HAGL Joint Stock Co.,  Vietnam ’s
second-biggest listed property developer, became the first
company from the country to list global depository receipts with
a $56.5 million sale on the London Stock Exchange today.  Proceeds from the issue will be used by the company, also
known as Hoang Anh Gia Lai Joint-Stock Co., in financing some of
its rubber plantation and hydropower projects, it said in a
regulatory announcement.  The placement would help lure the “attention of foreign
investors by sending them a message saying that Vietnam also has
good companies,” Doan Nguyen Duc, the company’s chairman said
in a telephone interview from  Laos .  The GDRs will trade on the London Stock Exchange’s
Professional Securities Market, according to the announcement.
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas was appointed depositary
for the listing.  Global depository receipts are negotiable certificates held
in the bank of one country representing a specific number of
shares of a stock traded on an exchange of another country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
