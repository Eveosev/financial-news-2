Odebrecht SA was forced to halt
work on the Santo Antonio hydroelectric dam in  Brazil ’s Amazon
region after workers went on strike, Valor Economico reported.  The project has been on hold since March 18 and it’s
unclear when work will resume, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
said. The workers are seeking higher wages and reduced shifts,
Valor said.  It’s the second Brazilian dam project put on hold amid
worker unrest, Valor said. The Jirau hydropower dam project was
halted after workers set fire to installations at the site last
week, Valor said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
