OAO Surgutneftegas may raise oil
production in east Siberia to 7.5 million metric tons in 2015 as
it ramps up output and develops new fields,  Interfax  said,
citing an unidentified person from the Surgut-based  oil company .  The Talakan deposit may produce 6.6 million tons, up from a
planned 5.2 million tons this year, Interfax said. Alinskoye
will boost output to 455,000 tons from 170,000 tons this year,
and new deposits will provide the rest, the news service said.  The oil will be exported via the East Siberian Pacific
Ocean Pipeline, Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
