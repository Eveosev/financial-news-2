The  New York Mets  fell to fifth
from third in Forbes magazine’s list of Major League Baseball
team values, while the Yankees remained the sport’s richest
team.  The Mets, whose owners are trying to keep control of the
franchise while fighting a lawsuit tied to the Ponzi scheme
created by Bernard L. Madoff, are worth $747 million, 13 percent
less than a year ago, Forbes said in a statement about the
 annual ranking .  The Yankees’ value rose 6 percent to $1.7 billion, almost
doubling that of the  Boston Red Sox , who at $912 million are the
second richest baseball team. The Yankees are the second-most
valuable team in U.S. sports, trailing the National Football
League’s  Dallas Cowboys , which Forbes valued at $1.805 billion
last August.  The Los Angeles Dodgers are third in value at $800 million,
a 10 percent increase, followed by the  Chicago Cubs  ($773
million) and Mets.  The average team is now worth an all-time high $523
million, a 7 percent increase from last year as new ballparks
and regional sports networks boosted revenue 4 percent to $6.1
billion, Forbes said.  The Philadelphia Phillies’ value rose 13 percent to $609
million, making them the sixth most valuable team.  The World Series champion San Francisco Giants were seventh
at $563 million, a 16 percent increase, and the Texas Rangers,
who in 2010 reached the  World Series  for the first time in team
history, were eighth at $561 million. Texas’s 25 percent
increase in value was the highest among the top 10 teams on the
list.  Angels Value  The Los Angeles Angels are worth $554 million and the
 Chicago White Sox  complete the top 10 at $526 million. Forbes
did not provide franchise values for the remaining 20 major-
league clubs.  Forbes estimated that the Mets, who went 79-83 in 2010, had
$6.2 million in operating losses, the least among the top 10
teams in the ranking. The team drew 2.55 million fans in their
second year at Citi Field, marking an attendance decline of
600,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
