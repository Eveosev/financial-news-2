Four family members were indicted
by a federal grand jury in Miami on charges they attempted to
export 22 F-5 fighter jet engines to  Iran  in violation of a U.S.
embargo.  Felipe Echeverry of Bogota, and three of his relatives
conspired to sell the engines for $320,000 to an undercover U.S.
agent and agreed to help ship them from Miami to Iran via
Panama, according to a  Justice Department  statement today.  Iran relies on a network of people often operating out of
houses or storefronts to evade the embargo and obtain parts with
military uses, U.S. officials have said. Iran produces an
aircraft compatible with the F-5 engine, according to the
Justice Department.  Also indicted were Diego Echeverri, 42, of Elmhurst, New
York.; Amparo Echeverri Valdes, 53, of Bogota; and Carlos
Alfredo Pantoja-Coral, 57, of Bogota.  Felipe Echeverry is believed to be in  Colombia  and the
other three defendants were arrested and being held in pretrial
detention, said Alicia Valle, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
attorneyâ€™s office in Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
