The  Los Angeles Dodgers  may be
allowed to boost their spending to sign new players heading into
the playoffs, according to the Major League Baseball-appointed
official monitoring the team’s finances.  “If there is a situation in which they are in the race and
they need to expand their budget, we would consider it at that
point in time,” Tom Schieffer, who was appointed to monitor the
Dodgers, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  The Dodgers must get Schieffer’s approval for expenditures
topping $5,000. Schieffer said he won’t interfere as long as
General Manager Ned Colletti stays within the team budget.
Major-league Commissioner Bud Selig appointed Schieffer to
oversee team finances after the Los Angeles Times reported owner
 Frank McCourt  needed a loan to make payroll.  “What I’m trying to do is get a handle on what the
financial situation is with the Dodgers,” Schieffer said. “And
try to help them.”  Allowing a financially troubled team to add players isn’t
without precedent. Last season, with the Texas Rangers operating
under bankruptcy protection, MLB allowed the team to sign
starting pitcher Cliff Lee, who helped the team advance to the
 World Series , Schieffer said.  “Hopefully, that kind of situation could repeat itself in
Los Angeles,” Schieffer said.  The Dodgers are 20-23 this season and in third place in the
National League West, 3 1/2 games behind the division-leading
Colorado Rockies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
