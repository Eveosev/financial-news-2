Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s
biggest private-equity firm, inched closer to breaking even on
its 5-year-old stake in Deutsche Telekom AG with the phone
company’s agreement to sell  T-Mobile USA  to AT&T Inc.  The $39 billion transaction, announced March 20, sent
shares up 13 percent in the past two days, boosting  New York- 
based Blackstone’s 4.4 percent holding by about 230 million
euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm owned
191.9 million shares of Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom as of Oct.
13.  The Blackstone stake still trades at 23 percent less than
the 14 euros-a-share the firm paid in March 2006, at the height
of the private-equity boom. The purchase of a minority interest
in a publicly traded company was a departure from Blackstone and
its buyout competitors’ play book of taking companies private or
buying them outright to more effectively change them and
eventually reap profits.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment.  Blackstone’s shares rose 5.5 percent in two days of New
York Stock Exchange composite trading as markets rebounded from
last week’s selloff.  The stock has gained 24 percent this year as the firm
invests a new buyout fund. Private equity stood as its third-
largest business by revenue last year, reflecting founder and
Chairman Stephen Schwarzman’s strategy of expanding beyond
traditional leveraged buyouts.  Deutsche Telekom rose 13 cents, or 1.2 percent, yesterday
in  Frankfurt  to 10.80 euros. Blackstone gained 9 cents to $17.54
in U.S. trading. The private-equity firm’s shares trade at 43
percent below their 2007 initial public offering price of $31 a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
