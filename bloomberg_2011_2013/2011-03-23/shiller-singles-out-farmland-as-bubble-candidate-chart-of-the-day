U.S. farmland may turn into “the
next big speculative bubble” as prices climb, according to
Robert J. Shiller, a Yale University economics professor.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the value of agricultural
land in the upper Midwest has doubled since 2002, according to
data compiled by the Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago. The chart
also depicts farm values in inflation-adjusted terms, which are
approaching their highs from the 1970s. The region encompasses
 Illinois ,  Indiana , Iowa,  Michigan  and Wisconsin.  Shiller, whose book “Irrational Exuberance” foreshadowed
the end of the 1990s surge in stocks, wrote yesterday that farms
are “my favorite dark-horse bubble candidate for the next
decade or so.” His  commentary  ran on the Project Syndicate
website.  “Farmland, as least in certain places, seems to have the
most contagious ‘new era’ story right now,” Shiller wrote. He
cited the risk of food shortages related to global warming as
contributing to a boom in the U.K., along with the U.S.  Land values rose 12 percent last year in the Chicago Fed’s
region, and there are signs that the increases are accelerating.
 Iowa ’s average cropland value rose 20 percent for the six months
ended in March, according to a survey released yesterday by the
Iowa Farm & Land Chapter No. 2 of the Realtors Land Institute.  Even so, Shiller wrote that forecasting any kind of bubble
is difficult at best. “Bubbles are social epidemics, fostered
by a sort of interpersonal contagion,” he wrote.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
