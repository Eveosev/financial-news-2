Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest
offshore oil producer, plans to start new fields at home and add
assets abroad after its fastest output growth boosted annual
profit by 85 percent.  “Rapid growth of the company’s production will continue
over the next few years,” Chairman Fu Chengyu said yesterday
after reporting net income reached a record 54.4 billion yuan
($8.3 billion). Cnooc will tap its  cash flow  to ramp up
exploration and acquire more assets, Fu said in Hong Kong.  Cnooc aims to boost production by as much as 11 percent
this year after commencing nine projects in China last year and
spending more than $8 billion on overseas assets. The Beijing-
based explorer will also gain from crude prices that have risen
29 percent in a year in  New York  as the global economy recovered.  “I can see production exceeding this year’s target,” Shi Yan, an analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by phone from
 Shanghai . “With overseas acquisitions, I can see similar levels
of increase in output in the coming years.”  Cnooc’s 44 percent output expansion last year helped the
company beat  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s 58 percent profit gain and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s 61 percent earnings growth. Exxon’s
output rose 13 percent, while Shell had an 11 percent increase.  Output may rise to as much as 365 million barrels this year,
Cnooc said. The Eagle Ford project in  Texas  and Bridas Corp. in
 Argentina , in which the Chinese company bought stakes last year,
may deliver production in 2011, Cnooc said in January.  Acquisitions and discoveries helped Cnooc replace 202
percent of its proven oil and gas reserves last year, the
highest rate since 2003, according to the earnings statement.
Ten new projects are being developed in 2011, the company said.  Ample Cash  The shares rose 51 percent in Hong Kong trading in the past
12 months, compared with the 9.6 percent gain in the benchmark
 Hang Seng  index. Cnooc climbed 2.2 percent to HK$18.84 at 9:35
a.m. local time today.  Cnooc will use its “relatively ample” cash flow for
exploration and acquisitions and has “no immediate need” for
external funding, Fu told reporters. Cash and cash equivalents
rose to 39.6 billion yuan last year from 22.6 billion yuan in
2009, according to the earnings statement.  So far this year, Cnooc has made two acquisitions. It
agreed in January to buy 33.3 percent of Chesapeake Energy
Corp.’s Niobrara shale-gas project for $570 million. Last month,
Bridas, in which the Chinese company has a 50 percent stake,
agreed to purchase Exxon’s refinery assets in Argentina.  Cnooc also has assets in  Australia ,  Indonesia , Trinidad and
Tobago, and  Nigeria .  Overseas Production  Overseas production accounted for 20.1 percent of total
output last year, compared with 17.4 percent in 2009, Cnooc said
in its earnings statement. By 2015, fields outside  China  may
account for more than 30 percent of overall production, the
company said in January.  Acquisitions of overseas assets since the beginning of last
year included the $3.1 billion purchase of a 50 percent stake in
Bridas. In October, Cnooc said it will buy a 33.3 percent stake
in Chesapeake’s Eagle Ford shale project in the largest
acquisition of a U.S. oil and gas asset by a Chinese company.  Cnooc’s second-half profit gained 66 percent to 28.4
billion yuan, according to calculations made by subtracting
first-half earnings from the 2010 net income. That beats the
previous semi-annual record of 27.5 billion yuan in the first
half of 2008.  The company didn’t give second-half figures in its earnings
statement. Jiang Yongzhi, the Beijing-based spokesman for Cnooc,
didn’t reply to three phone calls to his office seeking comment.  Net income may rise to 63.7 billion yuan this year,
according to a mean estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Twenty out of 29 analysts surveyed rate the shares a
“buy.” Five recommend holding the stock.  --John Duce and  Wang Ying . With assistance from Chua Baizhen in
