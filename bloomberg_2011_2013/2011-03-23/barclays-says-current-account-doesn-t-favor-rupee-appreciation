Kumar Rachapudi, a Singapore-based
fixed-income strategist at  Barclays Capital , comments on the
outlook for India’s rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency were
unchanged at 45.26 per dollar as of 11:33 a.m. in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 0.5 percent from the spot rate of
45.02.  “The currency is quite stable. It isn’t going anywhere in
a hurry and will be range-bound. This week I expect the rupee to
trade between 44.80 and 45.30.  “The concern on inflation is there and the current-account
deficit numbers don’t favor appreciation. Oil imports are a
significant part of the  trade balance  and there is also concern
that non-oil imports may rise.  “If portfolio inflows aren’t tapering off, there is no
fundamental risk to the currency in the long term.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
