India’s stocks gained for a second
day on expectations the nation’s economic expansion and company
profits will withstand shocks from higher crude  oil prices .  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the nation’s second-biggest lender, paced
a rally among banks outside state control after the government
proposed changing laws to ease limits on voting rights of the
largest shareholders in lenders.  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a
builder of dams, roads and bridges, rose 1 percent. India’s
economic growth has exceeded 8 percent the past four quarters.  “It’s a buy market,” Chokkalingam G., chief investment
officer at FCH Centrum Wealth Managers Ltd., a unit of Centrum
Broking Pvt., said in an interview. Expansion in the country’s
economy and company profits are giving him the “confidence to
buy shares” of companies including sugarmaker EID Parry Ltd.,
tiremaker MRF Ltd. and lender Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd., he said.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 196.34, or 1.1 percent, to 18,184.64 at 10:48 a.m. in
Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange
climbed 1 percent to 5,472.05, while its March futures traded at
5,458. The BSE 200 Index rallied 1 percent to 2,245.99.  ICICI surged 1.8 percent to 1,022.4 rupees. Jaiprakash
added 1 percent to 85.75 rupees. Larsen & Toubro Ltd.,  India ’s
biggest engineering company, climbed 1 percent to 1,536.25
rupees, while Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. advanced 1.5 percent
to 1,976.9 rupees.  The Sensex has slumped 11 percent this year, the worst
performer in  Asia , on concern government measures to curb price
increases will limit growth. Companies on the gauge are valued
at an average 17 times estimated earnings, compared with 21.5
times in March 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Last year, the index climbed 17 percent, adding to the 81
percent surge in 2009.  Overseas investors sold a net 679 million rupees ($15
million) of Indian stocks on March 21, increasing total outflow
from equities this year to 81 billion rupees, according to data
