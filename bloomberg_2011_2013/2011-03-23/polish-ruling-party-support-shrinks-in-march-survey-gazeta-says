Support for  Poland ’s ruling Civic
Platform party fell to 44 percent in a March 17-20 poll from 47
percent in a similar survey two weeks earlier, Gazeta Wyborcza
said, citing research by the Warsaw-based pollster TNS OBOP.    Backing for the largest opposition party, Law & Justice,
was unchanged at 24 percent, while support for the Democratic
 Left Alliance  was also unchanged at 15 percent, according to
Gazeta. The newspaper didn’t give the number of voters
responding to the survey, whose margin of error was 3 percentage
points.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
