U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened
against West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s premium to the
U.S. benchmark narrowed.  The gap between May-delivery WTI futures and Brent, its
European counterpart, decreased 80 cents to $9.93 a barrel at
12:52 p.m. in  New York . A narrower gap between Brent and WTI
weakens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with
West African oil priced against Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed $1.25 to
$13 a barrel at 12:28 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI
weakened $1 to $13.25 a barrel.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
narrowed 90 cents to $8.85 a barrel over the benchmark.
Poseidon’s premium narrowed $1 to $8.75.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened $1 to $8.75.
Thunder Horse’s premium narrowed 80 cents to $11.50 a barrel
over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to $3.70 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium narrowed 50 cents to $10 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 55 cents to
$17.25 a barrel. The spread has narrowed six out of the last
eight days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
