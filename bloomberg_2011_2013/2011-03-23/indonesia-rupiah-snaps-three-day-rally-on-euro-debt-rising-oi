Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened,
snapping a three-day rally, as rising  oil prices  and renewed
concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis damped demand for emerging-
market assets. Benchmark bonds rose.  The currency retreated from its strongest level in almost
four years after borrowing costs in Portugal and Ireland rose on
speculation European leaders meeting this week will be unable to
create a permanent rescue fund. Crude oil rose for a third day
as a U.S.-led coalition attacked forces loyal to Libyan leader
Muammar Qaddafi. Overseas funds sold $37 million more Indonesian
stocks than they bought in the first two days of the week,
according to exchange data.  “Investors are concerned about developments in Europe, the
Middle East and North Africa,” said  Prakriti Sofat , a
Singapore-based economist at Barclays Capital. “Escalating oil
prices are fanning inflationary pressures and weigh on current-
account balances in the region.”  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 8,721 per dollar as of
4:28 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 8,703 earlier, the strongest level since May 2007.  Consumer prices rose 6.84 percent in February from a year
earlier, the least in three months, official figures show.
Prices rose 7.02 percent in January, the most since April 2009.
Inflation data for this month will be released on April 1.  Ten-year  government bonds  gained for a fourth day. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell seven basis
points to 8.13 percent, according to closing prices by the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
