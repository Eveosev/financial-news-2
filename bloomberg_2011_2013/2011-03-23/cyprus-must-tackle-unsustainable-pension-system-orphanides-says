Cyprus’s communist-led government
must speed up spending cuts by overhauling the east
Mediterranean island’s pension system, Central Bank of Cyprus
Governor Athanasios Orphanides said.  “The fraction of gross domestic product that has to be
paid based on promises on pensions at the moment is 19
percent,” Orphanides said in Nicosia today. “Going forward,
the fraction of GDP that has to be spent in 2060 will be 30
percent of GDP based on current promises.”  The pension system poses “a chronic problem” and has
become “considerably worse in recent years” as growth
prospects for the euro area’s third-smallest economy declined
from around 4 percent before the global financial crisis, said
Orphanides, who is also member of the  European Central Bank ’s
governing council. “It is unlikely to see such growth rates in
the near future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
