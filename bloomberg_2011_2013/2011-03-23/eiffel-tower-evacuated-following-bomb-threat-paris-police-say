Paris police evacuated the Eiffel
Tower after receiving a bomb threat to the French capital’s
tallest building.  The site was still closed to tourists at 6:40 p.m. as
police and bomb specialists investigated, a spokesman for the
Paris Prefecture of Police, who declined to be identified in
line with department policy, said by phone. Investigators
haven’t yet found any evidence of a suspicious package, he said.  Evacuations due to false alarms and bomb threats aren’t
uncommon at Paris’s major tourist sites and transport hubs. The
Eiffel Tower was evacuated twice last September after threats,
along with the Saint-Lazare and Saint-Michel railway stations.  Police aren’t yet sure when the tower will re-open, the
spokesman said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
