Gasoline gained as the Energy
Department reported that inventories slipped to an 11-week low
and demand rose.  Futures reached a two-week high as stockpiles fell 5.32
million barrels to 219.7 million, the fifth straight drop. A
survey by Bloomberg News projected a decline of 2 million
barrels. Demand, as measured by deliveries to wholesalers, rose
2.8 percent to average 9.07 million barrels a day last week.  “We continue to see seasonal draws as refineries are going
into maintenance and refiners are reducing winter-grade gasoline
inventories,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for April delivery rose 1.68 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3.0213 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since March 9.  Demand, measured on a four-week average, was 1.2 percent
above the same period a year earlier.  Total fuel demand rose 1 percent from the prior week to
average 19.3 million barrels a day. The four-week average demand
was 0.5 percent below a year earlier.  “The bearish factor today is that nothing is really
bullish,” said  David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor
Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in Houston. “A headline draw is
welcome, but it’s a question of what’s the driver. Overall
demand is sluggish. Crude inventories and Cushing inventories
are building.”  Crude Supplies  Crude oil inventories rose 2.13 million barrels to 352.8
million in the week ended March 18, department data shows.
Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for the U.S.
benchmark crude grade, rose 0.4 percent.  Heating oil for April delivery dropped 2.12 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $3.055 a gallon, after reaching a two-week
high yesterday.  Heating oil slipped as stockpiles of distillates, including
heating oil and diesel, rose unexpectedly and demand fell.
Distillates stockpiles gained 7,000 barrels to 152.6 million,
after supplies had fallen the prior five weeks and lost 7.2
percent. Distillate demand slipped 3.6 percent to an average
3.77 million barrels a day, the lowest level in three weeks.  “This is a startling and pretty bearish signal,” said
Andrew Reed, a diesel analyst and a principal with Energy
Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Japan  Earthquake  Heating oil had gained on speculation that global diesel
demand and prices would rise because of lower fuel exports from
Japan after the March 11 earthquake and from greater demand for
 diesel fuel  to power Japanese industries after that country’s
nuclear crisis.  “There was all this anticipation,” Reed said.  Japan is  Asia ’s fourth-largest diesel exporter, according
to Energy Security Analysis. Exxon Mobil Corp. said today it
restored all four of its Japan Group refineries to full
operations.  Heating oil’s premium to gasoline narrowed to 3.37 cents
from 7.17 cents yesterday. The gap between the two products had
widened sixfold to 15.35 cents March 16 from 2.53 cents March 10
after the earthquake and tsunami struck Japan.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.1
cent to $3.548 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
