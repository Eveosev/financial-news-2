Telefonica SA (TEF)  will invest 24.3
billion reais ($14.6 billion) in Brazil from 2011 to 2014 to
modernize and expand networks, the company said in a release
distributed to journalists after Chairman Cesar Alierta met with
Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  in Brasilia today.  The investments, some of which will also go toward paid
television and buying operating licenses, are a 52 percent
increase from the 16 billion reais spent from 2007-2010, the
company said.  The goal is to “cover almost 100 percent of Brazilian
municipalities with telephone and broadband internet, with fixed
or mobile technologies,” Alierta said in the statement. By the
end of the year,  Vivo Participacoes SA (VIVO4) ’s 3G network will cover
2,832 cities and towns, the company said.  Vivo leads Brazil’s wireless market with 30 percent of
subscribers. Telefonica bought full control of Vivo last year
and plans to incorporate its stock into its fixed-line unit,
 Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA (TLPP3) , to cut costs. Vivo said last
month it will invest 3.48 billion reais this year, up 40 percent
from 2010.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
