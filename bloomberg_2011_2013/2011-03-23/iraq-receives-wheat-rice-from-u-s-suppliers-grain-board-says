Iraq  received 52,500 metric tons of
wheat and 41,109 tons of rice from U.S. suppliers, Hassan Ismail
Ibrahim, director general of the Grain Board of Iraq, said.  Two ships delivered the wheat and rice at the
southern port of Umm Qasr, Ibrahim said in an e-mailed
statement. The board last month signed 12 contracts to buy
850,000 tons of wheat from U.S. and  Australia .  Surging food costs and rising unemployment have helped spur
protests across northern Africa and the Middle East, toppling
leaders in Tunisia and Egypt this year. Iraq produces about half
of its grain consumption and is seeking foreign investment in
agriculture to be self-sufficient within three years,
Agriculture Minister Ezzeddin al-Dawla said two days ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
