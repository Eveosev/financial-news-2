China Oilfield Services Ltd. (601808) , a
unit of the country’s biggest offshore oil producer, advanced in
Shanghai trading after posting a record annual profit.  The shares climbed as much as 2.1 percent to 23.60 yuan,
and traded 1.8 percent higher at 23.52 yuan at 9:56 a.m. local
time, compared with the 0.1 percent increase in the benchmark
Shanghai Composite.  Net income rose to 4.13 billion yuan ($630 million) last
year, China Oilfield said yesterday. Domestic sales climbed 2.8
percent to 13.2 billion yuan as Cnooc Ltd., the oilfield
services provider’s largest customer, surpassed output growth
targets after starting new oilfields off the Chinese coast.  “We remain positive on the stock as China Oilfield
Services should be able to grow its revenue as deliveries of
new, higher-spec rigs support earnings growth in 2011,” Han Pin
Hsi, a Singapore-based analyst at Standard Chartered Bank who
has an “outperform” rating on the stock, wrote in a report
today.  As of the end of 2010, China Oilfield had eight drilling
vessels operating in the Bohai Sea, five in the South China Sea
one in the  East China Sea , and seven outside the country, the
China National Offshore Oil Corp. unit said in its earnings
statement.  The semi-submersible drilling rig COSL Pioneer may commence
operations this northern hemisphere summer, China Oilfield said
in the statement. The company said in December it was awarded a
contract for as many as five years for its COSL Pioneer rig with
Statoil ASA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
