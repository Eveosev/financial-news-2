Egyptian rights groups blamed
former President  Hosni Mubarak  and former Interior Minister
Habib el-Adly for the killing of protesters during an uprising
that toppled Mubarak,  Al Ahram  reported.  The report, jointly written by Egypt’s National Council for
Human Rights and the Arab Organization for Human Rights, and
presented to the public prosecutor, said Mubarak and el-Adly
were responsible for the deaths of protesters and the use of
excessive force against them, the state-owned newspaper said
today. The report called for both to be brought to account, it
said.  Some 365 people were killed and 5,500 injured during the
uprising, state TV reported on Feb. 17, citing the Health
Ministry.  There was no way to immediately contact representatives of
Mubarak or el-Adly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
