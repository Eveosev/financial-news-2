The  European Insurance and
Occupational Pensions Authority , Europe’s insurance regulator,
started a second “ stress test ” to see if firms can meet
 capital requirements  under new solvency regulations.  EIOPA will adopt  three stress scenarios  that make
increasingly severe assumptions about  interest rates  and falling
equity markets, the Frankfurt-based authority said in an e-
mailed statement today. It will also take into account real-
estate markets, credit and insurance risk.  Solvency II, as the new proposed regime for European
Union insurers is known, is being developed by the European
Commission, EIOPA and local regulators. The rules, tested by
regulators in a fifth quantitative impact study named QIS5
from August to November last year, are scheduled to come into
force in 2013.  EIOPA, set up this year to oversee insurers and pension
funds in  Europe  alongside local watchdogs, will survey more than
200 insurers’ earnings this year. It expects to publish the test
results in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
