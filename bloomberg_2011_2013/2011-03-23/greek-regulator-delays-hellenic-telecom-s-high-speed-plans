Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO) , Greece’s biggest phone company, won’t be able
to use new VDSL high-speed capabilities until September, because
of a ruling by the industry regulator.  The  Hellenic Telecommunications & Post Commission  said the
delay is necessary so rules and prices for high-speed services
can be introduced to ensure fair competition, according to a
statement on the regulator’s website.  Europe ’s former phone monopolies are upgrading their
traditional networks into Internet-based systems, including
VDSL, or Very-High Bitrate Digital Subscriber Line, which allow
faster transmission and services such as television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
