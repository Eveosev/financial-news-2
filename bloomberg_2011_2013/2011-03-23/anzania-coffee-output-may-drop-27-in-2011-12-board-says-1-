Tanzania’s coffee output may fall
as much as 27 percent in the year through June 2012 as drought
in the East African nation cuts yields, the country’s coffee
board said.  Production for marketing in Tanzania,  Africa ’s fifth-
biggest grower of the beans, may range from 40,000 metric tons
to 45,000 tons next year, compared with just over 55,000 tons
expected this season, Adolph Kumburu, the director general of
the Moshi-based agency, said today by e-mail.  The drop will be “due to drought reports from growing
regions,” he said.  The nation’s coffee, tea and lint cotton crops were reduced
because of a drought that lasted from December 2009 to March
last year. Tanzania, which consumes less than 3 percent of its
annual output, reaps the crop from April through August, while
its marketing season runs July to April or May.  Next season’s forecast compares with 35,700 tons in 2008-09
when the country’s yields were affected by a drought.  The East African nation is increasing planting in an effort
to raise coffee output to 100,000 tons by 2015, Kumburu said
last month. Tanzania grows both the robusta and arabica
varieties in the western Kagera region, while the northern
Kilimanjaro and southern regions mainly produce arabica. Arabica
accounts for about 75 percent of output, with robusta making up
the rest.  Tanzania is Africa’s fifth-largest coffee producer after
 Ethiopia ,  Uganda , the  Ivory Coast  and  Papua New Guinea .  To contact the reporter on this story:
