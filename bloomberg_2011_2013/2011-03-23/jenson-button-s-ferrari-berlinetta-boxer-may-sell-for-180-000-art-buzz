A Ferrari belonging to the former
world champion driver  Jenson Button  is estimated to sell for as
much as 110,000 pounds ($180,000) at an auction next month.  The black 1978 512BB Berlinetta Boxer was acquired by the
U.K.-born racer last year when Button was the reigning Formula 1
champion, having won the 2009 title for Brawn GP, said Bonhams.
The London-based auction house will include the Ferrari in its
sale at the RAF Museum, Hendon, on April 11, with a low estimate
of 90,000 pounds.  “After a thorough service that has addressed all the usual
issues with an older Ferrari, I’ve had a great time driving the
Boxer,” Button said in an e-mailed statement. “However my F1
commitments will not enable me to enjoy the car to its fullest.”  Buyers of collectors’ vehicles have become more selective.
The  Historic Automobile Group  International Top 50 index of
classic-car prices was up 6.6 percent in 2010, lower than its
average growth of more than 12 percent from 2003 to 2008.  “This is a car at the cheaper end of the market,” Ferrari
dealer John Collins, of the Ascot-based specialist  Talacrest ,
said in an interview. “Though there are quite a lot of Boxers
around, some people like them.”  The 188-mph Ferrari was one of 2,323 Boxers of all types
produced from 1973 to 1984, according to the catalog. It would
have cost about 30,000 pounds in 1978, Collins said.  Saatchi Baby  A sculpture of a baby by the Australian-born artist  Ron
Mueck  is the most valuable of 32 contemporary works being sold
by Kay Saatchi, the first wife of the U.K. collector Charles Saatchi, at auction in  London  in June.  The 1996 mixed media work, “Big Baby,” is 3 feet high
(0.9 meters). It is estimated to fetch as much as 1.2 million
pounds at Christie’s International on June 28. It was one of
seven hyper-realist sculptures by Mueck owned by the Saatchis,
who co-curated the “Sensation” show of young British artists
at the  Royal Academy  of Arts in 1997, said Christie’s.  Kay Saatchi’s entries also include five early Lucian Freud
drawings from the mid-1940s, ranging in value from 80,000 pounds
to 400,000 pounds.  “The 1940s are great dates for Freud,” the London-based
dealer  Offer Waterman  said in an interview. “Kay Saatchi had
her own taste, and there’s currently a thirst for quality across
all disciplines.”  U.S.-born Kay Saatchi came to London in the 1980s. A former
commercial gallerist, she was married to Charles Saatchi from
1990 to 2001. She is now moving to  Los Angeles , Christie’s said.  Japan Art  A London-based artist has reworked one of the most famous
images in Japanese art to raise funds for victims of the March
11 earthquake and tsunami.  “I watched the horrific images on TV and realized I had to
do something,” Charles Uzzell Edwards, an artist and director
of the Pure Evil Gallery in Mayfair, said in an interview.
“Something went ‘ping’ in my head. If you’re an artist you can
make things that can raise money.”  Using Photoshop, Edwards produced a monochrome digital
version of Katsushika Hokusai’s 19th-century woodblock “The
Great Wave,” with the surging waters blackened and choked with
21st-century debris.  The unlimited edition print is priced at 100 pounds each
with all proceeds donated to the  Japanese Red Cross . So far, 20
have been sold, Edwards said. The “Hokusai Tsunami print for
 Japan ” is available from  http://www.pureevilclothing.com .  The specialist auction house  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  is
also raising funds for Japan.  The Chicago-based company will be donating 3 percent of the
premium it charged buyers at its March 19 sell-out Chateau
Lafite auction to the Japan Earthquake Relief Fund. The event
totaled $5.9 million with fees.  “Many of the consignors in this auction will be matching
our donation and a total well above $30,000 is expected to be
raised with this collective effort,” Marc Smoler, HDH’s
marketing manager, said in an e-mail.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
