Zavarovalnica Triglav d.d.,
Slovenia’s biggest insurer, plans to raise capital through a
rights offering on a stock exchange in central  Europe , probably
the Warsaw bourse, Dnevnik  reported , citing unidentified people.  The company needs to meet stricter  capital requirements  and
to expand operations, the Ljubljana-based newspaper said.  Triglav is also looking to lower the government’s stake
from 62 percent to 33 percent, Dnevnik said.  Dusa Lindtner, spokeswoman for the insurer, declined to
immediately comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
