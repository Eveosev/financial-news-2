The  New Zealand dollar  rose to a
three-week high against its U.S. counterpart after the South
Pacific nation’s economy expanded more than forecast in the
fourth quarter, avoiding a recession.  Australia ’s dollar rose for a fifth day, the longest streak
since December, and touched the highest in more than two months
as the central bank said financial institutions will weather the
damage from natural disasters that struck the nation this year.
The New Zealand currency climbed against all 16 of its most-
traded peers as the government said gross domestic product
expanded 0.2 percent from October through December.  “Clearly the GDP report has been taken well by the market
which was nervous about a negative number,” said  Sean Callow , a
senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney.
“The kiwi will do reasonably well against the  U.S. dollar  as
risk appetite is proving to be quite resilient.”  New Zealand’s dollar climbed 1.4 percent to 75.12 U.S.
cents at 12:08 p.m. in  New York , from 74.06 cents yesterday. It
gained for a fifth day, also the longest since December, and
touched 75.22, the strongest since March 1. The kiwi, as the
currency is nicknamed, appreciated 1.4 percent to 60.77 yen.  Australia’s currency gained 0.8 percent to $1.0216, from
$1.0131 yesterday, and reached $1.0220, the highest level since
Jan. 3. It rose 0.8 percent to 82.60 yen, from 81.98 yen.  New Zealand’s economy shrank 0.2 percent in the three
months ended Sept. 30. The median forecast for the fourth
quarter in a Bloomberg News survey of economists was for growth
of 0.1 percent.  ‘Well Capitalized’  Australian banks are “well capitalized” and insurers have
the capacity to absorb costs associated with recent natural
disasters, the  Reserve Bank  of Australia said in its  Financial
Stability Review . Banks may face a period of slower growth as
borrowers show restraint, it said.  RBA Governor Glenn Stevens will raise  interest rates  10
basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, over the next 12 months,
according to a Credit Suisse Group index based on swaps trading.
The benchmark rate is 4.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
