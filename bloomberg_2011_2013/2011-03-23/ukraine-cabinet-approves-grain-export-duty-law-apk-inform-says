Ukraineâ€™s cabinet approved a draft
law setting export duties for grains, agricultural researcher
 APK-Inform  said, citing Mykola Markevych, head of the
Association of Farmers and Private Landowners  Proposed duties are 9 percent for wheat, 14 percent for
barley and 12 percent for corn, Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine-based
APK-Inform said on its website today. The bill won cabinet
approval on March 21, after which legislators must consider and
vote on the measure, it said. The association represents 43,000
farms and 3,000 individual agricultural producers.  Duties would replace the wheat, barley and corn export
quotas imposed by the government in October in an effort to curb
local prices after a summer drought cut the harvest. The current
export limits of 4.2 million metric tons run through March.  The draft legislation has yet to appear on the
parliamentary website. No reply has been received from the
 Economy Ministry  to a written request submitted last week by
Bloomberg News concerning the future of the limits.  As of March 1, the eastern European nation had exported 7.9
million tons of grains since the current marketing year started
July 1, Liza Malyshko, an analyst at Kiev-based researcher
UkrAgroConsult, said last week. Agriculture Minister Mykola
Prysyazhnyuk in January predicted outbound shipments of at least
13 million tons in the year.  The government may increase the quotas after the end of
March by 2 million to 2.5 million tons for corn and 500,000 to
800,000 tons for wheat, the minister said Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
