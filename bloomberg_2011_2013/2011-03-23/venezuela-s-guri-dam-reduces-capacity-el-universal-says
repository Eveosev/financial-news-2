Two turbines at  Venezuela ’s Guri
dam, the country’s largest hydroelectric plant, were shut down
this week, which may reduce generation by more than 1,000
megawatts, El Universal  reported .  A 730-megawatt unit was shut because of vibration problems
and a 375-megawatt turbine was taken offline for tests, the
Caracas-based newspaper reported today, without identifying
where it got the information.  Authorities have started rationing electricity in the
states of Cojedes and Anzoategui because of the reduced
capacity, the newspaper said. Guri dam produces about two-thirds
of Venezuela’s power. Reduced water flow at Guri dam could
affect generation at other dams downstream, El Universal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
