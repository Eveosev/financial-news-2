Italian President Giorgio Napolitano appointed two ministers in the biggest reshuffle of
Silvio Berlusconi’s government since his re-election in 2008.  Napolitano named Saverio Romano as the new agriculture
minister, even as he expressed “reservations” over Romano’s
involvement in a judicial probe for “serious crimes,” his  Rome 
office said in an e-mailed statement. Romano takes over from
Giancarlo Galan, who was appointed culture minister after Sandro Bondi resigned earlier today, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
