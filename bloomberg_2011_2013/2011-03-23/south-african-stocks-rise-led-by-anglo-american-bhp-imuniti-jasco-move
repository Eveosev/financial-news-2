percent, to 31,215.55 at the 5 p.m. close of trading in
Johannesburg. The following were among the most active stocks in
the South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the diversified mining company

index, gained 6.63 rand, or 1.9 percent, to 350.51 rand,
extending its increase this year to 2.1 percent. The company
said it was on the lookout for more iron-ore assets as it wants

subsidiary executive director in  Australia  today.  Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN)  , the largest maker
of generic medicines in the southern hemisphere, jumped to a

Stanley, which said opportunities aren’t reflected in the share
price.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  , the world’s largest mining
company, advanced 2.94 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 259.69 rand,
paring its decline this year to 2.2 percent. Copper increased
for a second day in  London  as orders to draw the metal from

that demand will outpace supply in 2011.  Metorex Ltd. (MTX)  ,
a copper and cobalt mining company, rose the most since Jan. 4,

clinical trials of its Imuniti Nutritional Supplement Combo Pack

clinical trials with a larger number of patients.  Jasco Electronics Holdings Ltd. (JSC)  , a
telecommunications company, dropped 1 cent, or 1 percent, to 96
