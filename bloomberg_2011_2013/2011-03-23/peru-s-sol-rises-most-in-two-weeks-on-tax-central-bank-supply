Peru’s sol rose the most in two
weeks on higher dollar flows from companies paying local taxes
and as central bank securities payable in U.S. currency expire.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.7779 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close of trading, from 2.7814 yesterday.  Peruvian firms led by mining companies are selling dollars
to make annual tax payments in soles beginning March 25 through
the first week of April.  Central bank certificates of deposit payable and redeemable
in dollars expiring this week are adding to the supply of U.S.
currency in the domestic market. The bank issued almost 800
million soles ($288 million) of two-month certificates in
January to soak up excess dollars and ease gains in the sol.  “As the central bank isn’t rolling them over, these are
dollars that will enter the market and go to the banks,” said
Ricardo Villamonte, head trader at Banco de Credito del  Peru ,
the South American country’s largest bank.  The central bank didn’t buy dollars in the foreign exchange
market today or issue additional certificates of deposit.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell from a nine-month high,
declining 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.48
percent, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
