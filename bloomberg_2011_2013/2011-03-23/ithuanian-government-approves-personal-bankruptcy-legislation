Lithuaniaâ€™s  government  backed draft
legislation that would require lenders to forgive debt for
private borrowers who declare bankruptcy.  The government approved the proposal, which is expected to
take effect next year, according to a live broadcast of the
meeting in Vilnius today. The draft bill still must be passed by
Parliament.  The legislation would allow borrowers who have declared
bankruptcy to write off their debt if it exceeds the equivalent
of 25 times the minimum wage, or about 20,000 litas ($8,204).
Borrowers would be able to declare bankruptcy once every 10
years.  Neighboring Latvia passed similar legislation last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
