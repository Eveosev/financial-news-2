Portugal’s  PSI-20 Index (PSI20)  retreated
106.22, or 1.4 percent, to 7,752.38 in Lisbon, heading for a
second day of declines.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Portuguese market today.  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  , Portugal’s biggest
publicly traded bank, dropped 2 percent to 3.07 euros.  Banco BPI
SA (BPI)  , Portugal’s fifth-largest bank, slid 2.3 percent to
1.30 euros.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  , Portugal’s
second-biggest bank by market value, fell 1 percent to 62.8 euro
cents.  Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates will today face a
vote in parliament against his deficit-cutting plan that
threatens to push the country toward early elections and the
need for a European Union bailout.  The five-year note yield climbed 13 basis points to 8.11
percent, the highest since the introduction of the euro in 1999,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 10-year bond yield
rose 7 basis points to 7.56 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
