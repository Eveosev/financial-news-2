Siberian Coal Energy Co.
shareholders agreed today to a plan to buy back as much as $823
million of its own stock, or about 10 percent of charter
capital, said Russia’s largest producer of power-station coal.  The price is set at 906.33 rubles ($32.01) a share,
according to a statement on its  website . The purchase period is
set from April 25 to May 29, and shareholders’ applications are
accepted from April 25 till May 24, the company said.  Earlier today Kommersant said the stock will be bought out
from majority owners Andrei Melnichenko and Sergei Popov, who
plan to use the cash to acquire Suek’s power unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
