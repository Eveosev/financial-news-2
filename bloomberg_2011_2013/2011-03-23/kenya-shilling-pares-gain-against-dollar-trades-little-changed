Kenya ’s shilling pared earlier
gains to trade little changed against the dollar.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy was at 84.95
per dollar at 5:03 p.m. in Nairobi compared with a close of
84.94 yesterday. The shilling earlier strengthened as much as
0.5 percent to 84.53.  The central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 6 percent yesterday,
reversing a cut announced two months ago, after the shilling
fell to a 17-year low and inflation accelerated for a fourth
consecutive month. All four economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News had forecast the rate would remain unchanged.  “The local unit has witnessed up and down swings in
response to the central bank’s decision to increase its rate, an
indication that the regulator is paying closer attention to the
currency’s movement,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of Treasury at
Nairobi-based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  Recent movements in the Kenyan shilling are an “over-
reaction” to expectations of future shortages of foreign
exchange because of higher  oil prices  and political turbulence
in North Africa, central bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said on
March 14.  The shilling, which has depreciated 4.5 percent against the
dollar this year, is the fifth worst-performing currency against
the greenback in the period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
