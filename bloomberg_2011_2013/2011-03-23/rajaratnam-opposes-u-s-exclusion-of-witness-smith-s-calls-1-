Raj Rajaratnam’s lawyers opposed a
bid by the U.S. to keep a jury from hearing recorded calls
between prosecution witness  Adam Smith  and a trader at Galleon
Group LLC.  Rajaratnam, 53, is on trial in the largest crackdown on
hedge-fund insider trading in U.S. history. The Sri Lankan-born
money manager and Galleon co-founder is accused of making
$45 million from tips leaked by corporate insiders and hedge
fund traders. He denies wrongdoing, saying he based his trades
on research.  Defense attorneys said in a letter dated today and filed in
 Manhattan  federal court that Smith’s calls to the Galleon trader
will “show his bias.” Smith, a former Galleon portfolio
manager who pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges, is
cooperating with prosecutors.  “Mr. Rajaratnam is offering the calls to impeach the
credibility of Adam Smith,” the defense lawyers said in the
letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell. “The calls
demonstrate, in a way no other evidence could, Mr. Smith’s
desire to inculpate others in order to save himself.”  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
