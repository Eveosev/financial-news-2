Australia  should double funding to
spur the development of low-emissions technologies to A$2
billion to A$3 billion a year as part of an effort to curb
pollution, government climate change adviser  Ross Garnaut  said.  “Technological change can substantially reduce the costs
of global and Australian transition to a low-emissions
economy,” Garnaut said in a report released today.  There is too little “private investment in innovation
generally in the absence of public fiscal support,” he wrote.  Prime MinisterJulia Gillard wants to set a price on carbon
emissions starting in July 2012 in preparation for a trading
system to begin as early as 2015. The opposition Liberal-
National coalition, led by  Tony Abbott , has vowed to fight the
plan, saying it would add to household electricity bills.  Abbott addressed protestors demonstrating against Gillard’s
plan in Canberra today as Garnaut prepared to release his
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
