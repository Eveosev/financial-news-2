Hong Kong  stocks fell, driving the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  lower for the first time in four days,
as  China  Coal Energy Co. reported earnings that missed estimates
and after a series of earthquakes struck Japan.  China Coal, the nation’s second-largest producer of the
fuel, dropped 7.5 percent. Maanshan Iron & Steel Co., China’s
second-biggest Hong Kong-traded steelmaker, slipped 2.4 percent
after reporting second-half earnings slumped 95 percent. Li &
Fung Ltd., Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s No. 1 supplier, sank 1.7
percent after home prices in the U.S. declined in January.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.5 percent to 22,751.10 as of
10:18 a.m. in Hong Kong, with about three shares declining for
each two that rose among the index’s 45 companies. The gauge
slumped 4.1 percent last week, the biggest weekly drop since
February, amid concern  Japan ’s strongest earthquake and damage
to a nuclear plant would cripple the world’s third-biggest
economy.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of H shares of
Chinese companies lost 0.5 percent to 22,755.63.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
