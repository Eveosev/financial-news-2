Australia captain  Ricky Ponting 
plans to quit international cricket at the end of the  World Cup 
and wants to end his career leading an English county team, the
Daily Mail  reported .  Ponting, 36, will resign if Australia loses to India in
tomorrow’s World Cup quarterfinal in Ahmedabad or when its
campaign is over, the newspaper said on its website without
saying where it got the information. The final is scheduled for
April 2 in Mumbai.  Ponting, who took over as national team captain from Steve Waugh in 2002, is fed up trying to prove he should carry on and
has accepted that he will have to quit before being fired by
Cricket  Australia , the Mail added.  The Sydney Morning Herald reported yesterday that officials
are weighing whether to replace Ponting as captain with Michael Clarke for next month’s tour of Bangladesh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
