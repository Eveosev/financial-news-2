Malaysia ’s economy may expand as
much as 6 percent this year and inflation is set to accelerate,
the central bank said, highlighting the pressure on prices from
rising consumer demand and escalating commodity costs.  Gross domestic product may expand 5 percent to 6 percent in
2011,  Bank Negara Malaysia  said in its annual report released
late yesterday. That matches the finance ministry’s forecast in
October, and compares with the decade-high 7.2 percent pace in
2010. Inflation may accelerate to a range of 2.5 percent to 3.5
percent this year from 1.7 percent in 2010, it said.  WHAT TO WATCH:
