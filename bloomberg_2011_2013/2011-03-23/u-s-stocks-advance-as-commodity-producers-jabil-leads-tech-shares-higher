U.S. stocks rose as higher metal
prices boosted commodity producers and technology shares climbed
after Jabil Circuit Inc.’s profit forecast topped estimates,
helping the market recover from an early slump.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4 percent to
1,298.54 at 2:54 p.m. in  New York  and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  advanced 78.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,097.00.  Equities slid earlier amid concern European leaders will
fail to fix the region’s debt crisis and after new U.S. home
sales slid to a record low pace. Equities reversed losses as
Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Carl Reichardt said in a note to
investors that the home-sales figures didn’t not reflect the
market’s “reality” and will probably be revised higher.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
