The Brazilian biofuels business
will see more mergers and acquisitions this year because capital
and resources are more available, said the head of  Codexis Inc. (CDXS) ,
a maker of enzymes used in ethanol.  “The industry is ripe for consolidation,” Alan Shaw,
chief executive officer of Codexis, said at a conference today
in Rotterdam, citing a need for increased capacity. “Two-thirds
of the sugarcane is under-utilized carbon and there’s already
huge amounts of biomass on the ground waiting to be converted
into something more valuable.”  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Cosan Sa Industria & Comercio
through its Raizen venture in Brazil hold a 16.5 percent stake
in Codexis. They will roll out a technology this year to make
biofuels from wheat straw and sugar-cane bagasse, the cellulose-
rich waste from cane processing.  The Hague-based Shell plans this year to invest $1.6
billion in its Brazilian biofuel project with Cosan, which
operates the world’s largest sugar-cane processor. The  oil
company  has been investing in alternative transport fuels, which
do not compete with food products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
