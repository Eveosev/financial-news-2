Bank of Moscow climbed for the
first day in four after RIA Novosti reported minority
shareholders offered to acquire a stake in the lender that VTB
Group previously agreed to buy.  The stock surged 7.3 percent to 1,054.6 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow trading, its highest level since March 9.  Minorities led by Chief Executive Officer Andrei Borodin
offered to buy a stake in the lender that VTB Group said it
would purchase from the city government in February, RIA said,
citing a copy of the offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
