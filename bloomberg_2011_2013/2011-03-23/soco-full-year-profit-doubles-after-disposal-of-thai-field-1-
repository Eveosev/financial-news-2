Soco International Plc (SIA) , a U.K. oil
and gas explorer, said full-year earnings doubled following the
sale of assets in Thailand.  Net income advanced to $101.4 million from $51.1 million in
the previous year, the London-based company said today in a
statement. Soco gained $80.1 million from the disposal of the
Bualuang field.  Net working interest production averaged 2,257 barrels of
oil equivalent a day from continuing operations, down from 2,848
barrels a year earlier, the explorer said. The company boosted
exploration in  Southeast Asia  and Africa and increased spending
on its Te Giac Trang development in Vietnam.  “We are on schedule for first oil from the TGT field,”
Chief Executive Officer Ed Story said in the statement. The
project is due to come on stream in the third quarter with peak
output of 55,000 barrels of oil a day in the first phase of the
development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
