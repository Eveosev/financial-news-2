Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker called for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
to take over “the great part of the command structure” of the
coalition operation to impose a no-fly zone over  Libya .  The 28-member alliance has yet to find the formula to
balance military needs and political sensitivities in the five-
day-old operation.  France  is resisting overall NATO command to
encourage more involvement by Arab countries.  “We regret the European disorganization on this
question,” Juncker told reporters today in Luxembourg. He said
Luxembourg “generally welcomes” the decision to impose a no-
fly zone and called for “strict adherence” to the United
Nations resolution that authorized it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
