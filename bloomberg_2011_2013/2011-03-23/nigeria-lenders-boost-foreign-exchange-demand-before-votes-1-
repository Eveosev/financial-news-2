Lenders in  Nigeria  sought $584
million dollars at the country’s twice-weekly auction of foreign
currency, the highest in three months amid rising demand before
elections scheduled to start in early April.  “The high demand for dollars is a speculative one by those
who want to keep it in case something goes wrong after the
election,” Kwekwu Brown, an analyst with Lagos-based Source
Capital  Nigeria  Ltd., said in a telephone interview.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  didn’t meet the demand, selling
$400 million for between 151.13 naira and 151.34 naira each, the
bank said in an e-mailed statement.  The high number of requests for dollars coincides with the
start of the foreign-exchange forward auctions, which the Abuja-
based bank said is meant to reduce demand pressure on the
existing foreign-exchange spot auction.  The central bank will meet the rising need from investors
for foreign currency before elections in West Africa’s biggest
economy next month as it tries to stabilize the naira and
control inflation, Governor Lamido Sanusi said on March 16. The
jump in demand this month is “temporary,” based on investors’
fears that violence between religious and ethnic groups may
disrupt elections, he said.  The marginal rate, which is also used as the prevailing
exchange rate, was 151.27 at today’s auction, compared with
151.21 naira at the previous auction held on March 21, the
 central bank  said. The currency weakened 0.7 percent to 156.11
naira per dollar by 4:38 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
