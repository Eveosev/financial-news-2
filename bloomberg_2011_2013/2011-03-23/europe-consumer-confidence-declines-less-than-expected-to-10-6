European  consumer confidence 
declined less than expected in March after surging  oil prices 
left households with less money to spend and Japanâ€™s earthquake
clouded the global growth outlook.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
fell to minus 10.6 from minus 10 in February, the Brussels-based
European Commission said today in an initial estimate.
Economists forecast a drop to minus 11, the median of 22
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The commission is scheduled to publish its monthly report
on euro-area economic confidence, which includes the consumer-
confidence gauge, on March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
