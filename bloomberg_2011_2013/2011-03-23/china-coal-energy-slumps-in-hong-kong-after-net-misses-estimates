China Coal Energy Co. slumped the
most in 10 months in  Hong Kong  trading after the country’s
second-largest producer of the commodity posted annual profit
that missed analysts’ estimates.  The stock slid as much as 7.8 percent to HK$10.90, the
biggest decline since May 25. The stock dropped 7.5 percent to
HK$10.94 at 9.39 a.m. local time, compared with a 0.5 percent
decline in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Net income increased 1 percent to 7.47 billion yuan ($1.1
billion), China Coal said yesterday, missing a mean estimate of
10.03 billion yuan in a Bloomberg survey of 17 analysts.
Operating costs increased 38 percent, the company said.  The stock has fallen 5.5 percent in the past 12 months,
compared with the 8.6 percent gain in the  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   --Chua Baizhen. Editors: Ryan Woo, Clyde Russell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
