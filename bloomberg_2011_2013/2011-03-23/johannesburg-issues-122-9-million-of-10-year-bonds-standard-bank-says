The City of Johannesburg sold its
longest maturity bonds since before the global credit crisis in
2008, raising 850 million rand ($123 million) in 10-year
securities.  The bonds were priced at face value to yield 10.78 percent,
or 195 basis points more than similar-maturity national
government debt, said Andrew Costa, head of debt capital markets
for  Standard Bank , which arranged the sale. The cost of the
borrowing is below the 10.815 percent on 900 million rand of
seven-year bonds issued in December 2008.  South African companies have raised about 32.7 billion rand
of bonds so far this year in the busiest quarter since 2005,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales have almost
doubled from the same period last year.  “It was a difficult time for a municipality to issue given
the quantum of issuance in the  bond market  at the moment,”
Costa said. “We raised more than we had anticipated.”  The bonds are the longest maturity debt since the city sold
2.3 billion rand of 15-year securities in June 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
