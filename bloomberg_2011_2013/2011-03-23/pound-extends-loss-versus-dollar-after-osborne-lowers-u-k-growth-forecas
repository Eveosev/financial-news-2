The pound extended losses against
the dollar after Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
lowered his estimate for U.K. economic growth to 1.7 percent
this year, down from previous forecast of 2.1 percent.  Sterling slid as much as 0.8 percent to $1.6231 and traded
at $1.6235 as of 12:48 p.m. in  London . The pound traded 0.4
percent weaker at 87.06 pence per euro, after declining to as
weak as 87.25.  Osborne also said the U.K. budget deficit would be 146
billion pounds this year and 122 billion pounds in fiscal
2011-12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
