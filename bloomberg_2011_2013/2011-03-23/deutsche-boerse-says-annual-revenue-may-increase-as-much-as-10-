Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) , which last
month said it will buy NYSE Euronext and create the world’s
largest operator of stock and derivatives exchanges, forecast
revenue may rise as much as 10 percent in 2011 if “confidence
in global markets” improves.  Sales for the year could rise to 2.1 billion euros ($3
billion) to 2.3 billion euros, the exchange said in its  annual
report  today, and may grow at a similar rate in 2012. Still,
revenue for 2011 may also fall to 2 billion euros if markets
weaken, the Frankfurt-based company said.  The report was prepared before the NYSE transaction,
according to the company. Earnings before interest and taxes are
likely to be in a range of about 1.05 billion euros to 1.25
billion euros this year, it said.  Deutsche Boerse  and  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  have said they will
combine in a $9.53 billion all-stock takeover. Deutsche Boerse
owns the Frankfurt stock exchange and is part-owner of Eurex,
 Europe ’s largest futures market, along with the Swiss exchange.
Eurex bought New York-based International Securities Exchange
Holdings Inc. in 2007. Deutsche Boerse also owns Clearstream,
the region’s second-largest securities-settlement company, as
well as Eurex Clearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
