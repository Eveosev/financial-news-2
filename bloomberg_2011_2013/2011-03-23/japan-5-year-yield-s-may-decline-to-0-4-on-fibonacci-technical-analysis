The yield on five-year Japanese
bonds may fall toward 0.4 percent as they retrace gains from
last year’s low, JPMorgan & Chase Co. said, citing trading
patterns.  The yield may target 0.4125 percent, a 50 percent
retracement from a low of about 0.2 percent to a high of around
0.625 percent in the past six months, based on the Fibonacci
sequence, according to Takafumi Yamawaki, chief rates strategist
for JPMorgan in  Tokyo .  “The yields may decline to about 0.4 percent, given the
fact that they temporarily reached 0.395 percent at the end of
last year and the beginning of this year,” Yamawaki said.  Medium-term bonds will likely gain once the focus of the
market shifts to a delay in economic recovery in the wake of the
the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami that struck  Japan  on
March 11, Yamawaki said. It wouldn’t be surprising if yields
moved to lower levels after Japan’s new fiscal year starts in
April, he said.  Five-year yields have climbed from a low of 0.435 percent
on March 15, the day Japan’s stocks suffered their third-worst
daily declines in history. The rates reached 0.20 percent on
Oct. 6, the least since June 2003, before rising to 0.625
percent on Feb. 9.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
