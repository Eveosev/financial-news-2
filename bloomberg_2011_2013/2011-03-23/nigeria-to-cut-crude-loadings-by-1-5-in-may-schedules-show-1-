totaling 63.4 million barrels, or 2.04 million barrels a day,
the plans show. That compares with 69 cargoes totaling 2.08
million barrels a day in April.  The country will export six Agbami, five Akpo, three
Amenam, two Antan, five Bonga, six Bonny Light, eight Brass
River, five Erha, six Escravos, six Forcados, two Okwori, 13 Qua
Iboe and three Yoho cargoes in May, loading programs showed.
There will be no exports of Oso condensate, or light crude.
Cargo sizes range from 260,000 barrels to 1 million barrels and
most shipments are 950,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
