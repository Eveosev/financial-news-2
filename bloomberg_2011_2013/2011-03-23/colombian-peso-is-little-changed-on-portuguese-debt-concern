Colombia ’s peso was little changed
as traders awaited a decision on whether Portuguese lawmakers
will reject an austerity plan proposed by the European country’s
government.  The peso declined 0.3 percent to 1,872 per U.S. dollar at
1:03 p.m. New York time, from 1,866.80 yesterday.  Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates faces a vote in
parliament today against his deficit-cutting plan that threatens
to push the country toward early elections and the need for a
European Union bailout.  Traders are waiting to see what happens in Portugal as
Latin American currencies are subject to “swings in risk
appetite” determined by European sovereign debt concerns, said
 Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America fixed-income research at
IDEAglobal in  New York .  “We’re looking for the next European shoe to drop,”
Alvarez said by phone.  The yield on the Colombian government’s benchmark bonds due
in July 2020 rose 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
8.20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
