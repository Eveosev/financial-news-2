Iberdrola Renovables SA (IBR)  declined in
Madrid after its board accepted an improved bid by the parent
company to buy out minority shareholders.  Renovables slipped 0.8 percent to 3.027 euros at 11:24 a.m.
local time.  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , the 80 percent owner of its renewable-
energy unit, was unchanged at 6.05 euros.  Iberdrola said in a filing yesterday after the market
closed that both boards approved its improved offer of 0.5045 of
its own shares for each share owned by other investors in
Valencia, Spain-based Renovables. The parent company said that
represented 3.4 percent more than the original March 8 offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
