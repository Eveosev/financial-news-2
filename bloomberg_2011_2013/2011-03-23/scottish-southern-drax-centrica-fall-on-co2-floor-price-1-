Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE) ,
Drax Plc and  Centrica Plc (CNA)  dropped in London trading after
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said U.K. generators
will have to pay a new charge on carbon dioxide emissions.  Scottish & Southern dropped 25 pence, or 2 percent, to
1,207 pence. Centrica retreated 2.6 percent to 317.6 pence,
while Drax, owner of western Europe’s largest coal-fired power
plant, fell 4.3 percent to 392.2 pence.  The utilities will have to pay a new levy starting in 2013
that sets a minimum of 16 pounds ($26) for every metric ton of
carbon dioxide they emit, adding to the existing costs of
pollution permits under Europe’s cap-and-trade program.  In December, the Treasury laid out three scenarios that set
a minimum price on carbon of 20, 30 or 40 pounds a ton by 2020,
rising to 70 pounds a ton by 2030. The tax is intended to
discourage fossil fuels and drive investment in low-carbon  power
plants , including nuclear reactors and offshore wind projects.  The charge announced today will rise to 30 pounds a ton by
2020, Osborne said in a speech to Parliament. The so-called
carbon price support is designed to replace an existing levy
established by the Labour party in 2000 on all energy,
regardless of how much CO2 is emitted.  “The carbon price floor is important for all low carbon
technologies as it restores the carbon price to what was
originally intended,” Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive
officer of Electricite de France SA’s U.K. unit, said in a
statement. A floor is needed to encourage investment in existing
and new nuclear power plants, he said.  More than 110 billion pounds is required by 2020 to replace
old reactors, upgrade the  power grid  and build renewable
projects like offshore windfarms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
