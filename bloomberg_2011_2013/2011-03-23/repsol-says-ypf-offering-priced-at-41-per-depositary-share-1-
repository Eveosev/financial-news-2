Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, said the price of an offering of stock in Argentine
unit YPF was set at $41 per American depositary share, valuing
the sale at $1.07 billion.  The company increased the offering to 26.2 million American
depositary shares, or 6.67 percent of YPF, said Kristian Rix, a
spokesman for Madrid-based Repsol. The company expects the
offering will be closed on March 28, reducing its holding in
Buenos Aires-based YPF to 69.2 percent.  The Spanish oil producer said in a filing that it has also
given the banks managing the offering a 30-day option to buy as
much as 3.93 million additional American depositary shares in
YPF at the same price. Repsol on March 14 had said it agreed to
sell 3.83 percent of YPF for $639 million and announced the plan
to sell more shares through an offering.  Repsol is seeking to reduce business in maturing fields in
 Argentina  while investing in exploration in  Brazil ’s offshore
 Santos Basin  and elsewhere to increase output. Repsol in 2008
delayed a public offering of a stake in YPF, which produces and
processes about 50 percent of  Argentina ’s oil and controls about
half the domestic fuel market.  Repsol shares fell as much as 2.2 percent to 23.47 euros,
and traded at 23.60 euros at 1:06 p.m. in  Madrid . They have
climbed 13 percent this year, valuing the company at 29 billion
euros ($41 billion).  Retain Majority  The joint bookrunners of the YPF offering are Credit Suisse
Group, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, Itau BBA, Morgan
Stanley,  Raymond James  and  Banco Santander , YPF said in a filing
earlier this month.  Chief Executive Officer Antonio Brufau said in April last
year that Repsol aims to keep at least 51 percent of YPF. On
Dec. 23, the company agreed to sell 3.3 percent of YPF for $500
million to funds advised by Eton Park Capital Management,
Capital Guardian Trust Co. and Capital International Inc.  Argentine investor Sebastian Eskenazi, whose family bought
15 percent of YPF from Repsol for $2.2 billion in 2007, also has
an option to boost his interest to 25 percent by 2012.  Repsol’s oil and gas production at its upstream unit, which
excludes YPF, rose 3.2 percent to 344,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day in 2010. Output from the YPF unit fell 5.4
percent to 541,000 barrels a day.  The Spanish company forecasts annual production growth at
its upstream division of as much as 4 percent through 2014 as
projects in  Brazil  and Peru start. It plans to invest 28 billion
euros from 2010 to 2014 on fields in Venezuela, Bolivia and
 Algeria . The company will invest about 6 billion euros this year
and plans to drill 25 to 30 exploration and evaluation wells,
Repsol said last month.  The reserve replacement ratio rose to 131 percent last
year, meaning Repsol found more oil than it produced, up from 94
percent in 2009. The company has estimated a ratio of more than
110 percent in the next five years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
