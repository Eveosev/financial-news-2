Fisher Communications Inc. (FSCI) , a
Seattle-based broadcasting company, said it hired Moelis & Co.
to explore a possible sale or financing of Fisher Plaza, its
headquarters near downtown  Seattle .  The 300,000-square-foot office and data center complex,
built in 2001 at the end of the Internet boom, includes two six-
story buildings and land with a net book value of $106 million
as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report. Fisher
Plaza, located across the street from the city’s landmark Space
Needle, was 96 percent occupied as of the end of 2010.  The company said it plans to use proceeds from a sale or
financing to redeem its outstanding 8.625 percent senior notes
or repurchase common stock. Fisher Communications said it can
redeem the senior notes at 102.875 percent of par value and buy
back as much as about $32 million of common stock.  Fisher Communications, which tried to sell Fisher Plaza in
early 2008, is considering a possible sale again as U.S.
commercial real estate prices recover from their lows during the
credit crisis. The company suspended the earlier attempt in
November that year.  No timetable for a possible sale has been set, the company
said in a statement.  The  buildings  at 100 and 140 4th Avenue North house the
KOMO-TV studios, the local ABC affiliate. One property was
assessed at $52.2 million and the other at $28.3 million for the
2011 tax year, according to King County property records.  Fisher Communications operates 13 full-power television
stations and 7 low-power television stations that include
network affiliations with ABC, CBS, FOX, Univision and CW, and
10  radio stations . Its online division, Fisher Interactive
Network, produces local websites and other services.  Fisher Communications didn’t immediately return calls for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
