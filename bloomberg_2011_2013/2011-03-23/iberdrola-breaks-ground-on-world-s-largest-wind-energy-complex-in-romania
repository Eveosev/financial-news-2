Iberdrola Renovables SA (IBR)  began
building a wind park in  Romania , the first of about 50 the
Spanish company plans there in a complex that would rank as the
world’s largest installation of generators harnessing the wind.  The Valencia, Spain-based company will use turbines made by
Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA for the 80-megawatt facility,
it said today in a statement.  The unit of Spain’s  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  said the enlarged project
would have a 1,500-megawatt capacity, or more power potential
than an average atomic plant, should all 50 plants get built.
The project is targeted to end in 2017.  The first 80-megawatt phase, known as Mihai Viteazu, is in
the Constanta area of the Dobrogea region and is set to enter
service by year-end, Iberdrola Renovables said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
