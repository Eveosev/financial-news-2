Getting pumps and cooling circuits
working at the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant
in  Japan  may take days even after power is restored, according
to the French nuclear watchdog.  “There will be a risk of creating short-circuits in
material that was underwater,” Marie-Pierre Comets, a
commissioner at the Paris-based Autorite de Surete Nucleaire,
said at a press conference today. “There are a lot of tests on
the cooling systems that have to be carried out.”  Seawater used to cool the reactors and spent-fuel pools may
have caused corrosion in cooling equipment and salt could have
crystallized in some places, hindering the ability of water to
cool fuel rods, Comets said.  Workers were evacuated today from the No. 3 and No. 4
reactors after grayish smoke was seen rising from one of the
buildings, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Japan
Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Tokyo Electric Power Co.,
the operator, is attempting to restore electricity to the
reactors, which need a constant flow of coolant to prevent
nuclear fuel from overheating and emitting radiation.  “Stocks of fresh water need to be increased at the reactor
site,” the Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire,
another French atomic regulator, said in a statement.  Reactors No. 1, 2 and 3 remain in a “critical state”
because a lasting cooling system hasn’t been put in place, the
agency said. “The effects of salt in the water that has been
injected could modify cooling of the fuel over the short term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
