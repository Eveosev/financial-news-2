The Australia dollar fell, snapping
a three-day gain, as a decline in Asian stocks reduced demand
for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie dropped 0.3 percent to $1.0072 as of
11:40 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday in  New York . The currency
declined 0.4 percent to 81.45 yen.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
