Nigeria ’s expansionary budget is
“unimplementable” and the government must curb spending to
“avoid the boom and bust” cycles of the past, Finance Minister
Olusegun Aganga said.  “We are concerned about the level of deficit, the level of
borrowing,” Aganga said in an e-mailed statement today. Aganga
said he plans to “engage” with the National Assembly to
“resolve these areas of concern.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
