India ’s 11-year bonds gained for a
second day on speculation domestic banks are buying more debt to
push prices higher, boosting the value of their portfolios,
before the financial year-end.  Lenders have lifted their holdings of government debt by
370 billion rupees ($8.2 billion) this year through Feb. 25,
according to the latest central bank data. Rupee bonds have
returned 1.94 percent in 2011, the third-best performance in the
region after Singapore and  Taiwan  among 10 Asian local-currency
debt indexes tracked by HSBC Holdings Plc.  “The  bond market  is showing a bit of an improvement in
sentiment, helped mainly by the buying of big banks aimed at
pushing up portfolio valuations ahead of March 31,” said R.S.
Chauhan, chief fixed-income trader at  State Bank  of Bikaner &
Jaipur in Mumbai. “This is a trend we see toward every
financial year-end.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent note due August 2022 dropped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.10 percent at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, added two basis points to 7.47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
