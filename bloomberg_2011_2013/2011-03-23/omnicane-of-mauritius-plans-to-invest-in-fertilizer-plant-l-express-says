Omnicane Ltd. (MTMD) , a Mauritian sugar
producer, will take a 33 percent stake in a new 67,000 metric-
ton fertilizer plant,  l’Express  said, citing Arnaud Leclezio,
managing director of Island Fertilizers Ltd., which holds the
remaining shares.  The plant will be built in the south of the island nation,
close to Omnicane’s existing sugar refinery, energy and ethanol
production plants, the Port Louis-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
