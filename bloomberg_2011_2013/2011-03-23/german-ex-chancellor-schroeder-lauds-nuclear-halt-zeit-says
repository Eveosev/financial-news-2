Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose government introduced a withdrawal from nuclear
energy, lauded his successor’s decision to place a moratorium on
an extension of atomic power,  Die Zeit  newspaper reported.  “It makes me very happy when people are adaptable,”
Schroeder told the newspaper in an interview. “It’s welcome
social progress when others are capable of recognizing that we
need to exit nuclear energy as quickly as possible.”  Chancellor Angela Merkel  last week declared the three-month
moratorium to conduct a risk analysis of  Germany ’s 17 reactors
after the Japanese nuclear disaster in Fukushima, putting the
brakes on an extension of reactor lifespans that was a bedrock
of her government’s energy policy. Schroeder told Die Zeit that
a political moratorium was no replacement for new legislation.  “Of course it would have been better to say that the
extension was a mistake that we’re taking back,” Schroeder was
cited as saying. Schroeder passed legislation to phase out
nuclear energy by about 2022 when his Social Democrats led a
coalition with the environmental Greens party from 1998 to 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
