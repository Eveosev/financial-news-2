Pacific Investment Management Co.,
manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, invested in the
finance arm of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  after the earthquake in  Japan 
and is finding “select” investment opportunities in the
country.  “Over time, they’re going to be building back the economy,
so there are good selective investments there,” Kiesel said
today in an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “In the
Loop.”  Kiesel, who helps oversee $400 billion of credit assets at
Pimco in  Newport Beach ,  California , also said the investment
manager is buying the debt of “rising stars” in Russia,  Brazil 
and other developing economies, including OAO Gazprom, Russia’s
gas export monopoly and Brazil’s  Vale SA (VALE3)  , the world’s
biggest iron-ore producer, Kiesel said in the interview.  “Gazprom controls 18 percent of the gas in the world,”
and will have pricing power as inflation accelerates, said
Kiesel, Pimco’s head of corporate bond portfolio management.
“They also are the exclusive export monopoly within  Russia  for
gas, so they control all the pipelines.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
