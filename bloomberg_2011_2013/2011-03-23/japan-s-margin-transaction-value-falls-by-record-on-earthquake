The total value Japanese shares
bought and sold through margin transactions plunged the most on
record last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total buying through margin transactions in the week ended
March 18 slid 485 billion yen ($6 billion), or 26 percent, to
1.4 trillion yen. That’s the biggest plunge since 2005, when
Bloomberg began compiling the data issued by the  Tokyo  Stock
Exchange. The value of short positions held through margin
accounts also dropped by a record, losing 144 billion yen to 575
billion yen.  “Investors are closing their positions on margin
transactions,” as the outlook on Japan’s economy and corporate
profits become uncertain following the nation’s March 11
earthquake, said Takahiro Tsuchiya, a strategist at Daiwa
Institute of Research Ltd.  The data is for stocks traded on the first and second
sections of the Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya stock exchanges.  To contact the reporters on this story:
