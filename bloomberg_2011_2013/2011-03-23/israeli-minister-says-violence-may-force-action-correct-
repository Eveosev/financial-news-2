(Corrects spelling of minister’s name.)  Israeli Interior Minister Eli Yishai linked a bombing in  Jerusalem  that wounded at least 25
people today to the stabbing deaths of an Israeli family in the
West Bank settlement of Itamar earlier this month and the rising
number of rocket and mortar attacks on southern Israel from the
 Gaza Strip . “I see a trend here and if it continues then, no
doubt, we will have to take action,” Yishai said on Army Radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
