Cocoa arrivals from Bahia, Brazil’s
biggest growing region, more than doubled from a week earlier,
according to analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors from Bahia’s growing
areas totaled 11,302 bags in the week to March 20, Hartmann
wrote in a report dated yesterday. That compares with the 5,107
bags a week earlier. Total arrivals from across Brazil were
32,813 bags, compared with 9,404 bags a week earlier. A bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  The figures “are somewhat inflated due to the inclusion of
quantities that had arrived during the Carnival weeks but only
were reported after the transmission of last week’s report,”
Hartmann said. Brazil celebrated its annual Carnival festival
earlier this month.  Bahia represents almost 80 percent of the country’s cocoa
output, and 95 percent of its grindings, according to Hartmann.
He is a board member of the Commercial Association of Bahia and
is in charge of the group’s statistical service on Brazilian
cocoa output.  Hartmann predicted in December that  Brazil ’s main crop may
reach 1.2 million bags.  To contact the reporter on this story:
