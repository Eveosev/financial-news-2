Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , the unit of the
casino company founded by billionaire Steven Wynn, and Lan Kwai
Fong Holdings Ltd. stopped buying ingredients from  Japan  for
their Japanese restaurants on concern of radiation leaks.  “It is the prudent thing to do and we hope it’s only
temporary,” Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong and vice
chairman of Wynn Macau, said in an interview by phone today.
“Until the situation in Japan clarifies, it’s better to import
from other areas.”  Japan’s March 11 record earthquake and the tsunami
unleashed after crippled the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant,
spurring hotels and restaurants worldwide to suspend food
imports. Japan’s nuclear-safety agency said the nation will
limit distribution of vegetables and milk after samples from the
area near the plant were found to have higher-than-normal
radiation levels.  Lan Kwai Fong, developer of  Hong Kong ’s iconic stretch of
bars and restaurants, runs two Japanese restaurants, Tokio Joe
and Kyoto Joe. Wynn Macau runs the Okada restaurant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
