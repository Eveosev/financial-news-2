Merafe Resources Ltd. (MRF) , part owner
of the worldâ€™s biggest ferrochrome producer, said the European
benchmark price of the alloy was settled at $1.35 a pound for
the second quarter, rising for the first time in a year.  The price climbed 8 percent from the first quarter, the
Johannesburg-based company said today in a statement. The last
time benchmark prices increased was in the second quarter last
year, when contracts advanced to $1.36 a pound from $1.01.  Merafe, which owns part of a South African ferrochrome
venture run by  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , said in November it expects a
recovery in the ferrochrome market through to 2013 as the global
economy emerges from a recession and producers fail to bring on
new capacity in  South Africa .  Merafe rose 1.4 percent to 1.50 rand at the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg today.  European benchmark prices for ferrochrome, which is used to
prevent corrosion in stainless steel, are negotiated quarterly
between the largest producers and their biggest customers. Spot
prices for ferrochrome reached a high of $2.85 a pound in the
European Union in May 2008, according to Metal Bulletin.  To contact the reporters on this story:
