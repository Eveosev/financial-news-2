Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and IPCom GmbH & Co. both
declared victory in their long-running patent battle after a
German court rejected appeals in a case involving  Robert Bosch
GmbH .  An appeals court in Karlsruhe, Germany, said neither Nokia
nor Bosch could force each other to agree to license terms after
negotiations over the disputed patents failed in 2006, the
tribunal’s spokeswoman, Christiane Oehler, said in an e-mailed
statement. Bosch sold the patents to IPCom a year later.  “Both parties argued that they were bound by a so-called
pre-contractual agreement requiring them to now agree to certain
terms,” said Oehler. “But they were so far apart during
negotiations that we cannot speak of a pre-contractual agreement
here.”  The suit is part of a dispute in which IPCom, based in
Pullach,  Germany , is seeking to force Nokia to pay royalties for
a portfolio of the mobile-technology patents it acquired from
Bosch in 2007. The two companies are entangled in patent
litigation across  Europe .  “Nokia is pleased that the Karlsruhe court rejected
IPCom’s disproportionate and excessive claims for royalties,”
Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said in an e-mail. “We believe that
IPCom remains bound by Bosch’s commitment to grant licenses on
fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.”  IPCom, which backed Bosch’s position in the case, said the
ruling was “the greatest of all the recent enormous successes
we had in the dispute with Nokia.”  Today’s case is OLG Karlsuhe, 6 U 66/09.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
