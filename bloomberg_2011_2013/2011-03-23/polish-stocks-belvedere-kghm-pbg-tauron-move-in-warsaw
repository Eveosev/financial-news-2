Poland ’s WIG20 Index declined 5.73,
or 0.2 percent, to 2,762.38 at 2:50 p.m. in Warsaw, extending
yesterday’s 0.9 percent drop.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Belvedere SA (BVD)   sank 8.1 zloty, or 3.3 percent, to
237 zloty, falling for a second day. Chief Executive Officer
Jacques Rouvroy and his deputy lost a legal bid to recover
shares in the vodka-maker seized by London hedge funds in June.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, climbed 2.8 zloty, or 1.6 percent,
to 178.2 zloty, heading for the highest close in more than two
weeks. Copper rose as orders to draw metal from inventories
jumped the most in 11 months, feeding speculation that demand
will outpace supply in 2011.  PBG SA (PBG)  , Poland’s biggest builder by market value,
slid for a fourth day, losing 2.3 zloty, or 1.2 percent, to
188.7 zloty as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its share-price
estimate 4.1 percent to 209 zloty.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)   advanced as much as 1.9
percent to 6.32 zloty and last traded 0.8 percent higher at 6.25
zloty. Poland said it won’t sell any more shares in its second-
largest power utility following yesterday’s offer of a 12
percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
