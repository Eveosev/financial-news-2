Serbia proposed to the European
Commission to equalize its excise duties on different types of
fuels, after the country disproportionately increased them
earlier this year favoring its sole local refiner,  Vecernje
Novosti  newspaper reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic.  Serbia offered to increase the excise taxes on products
from Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, majority owned by OAO Gazprom
Neft, while lowering them for higher-quality gas and diesel
fuels that come from imports, the report said. Serbia wants to
honor its free-trade agreement with the bloc and a response from
Brussels is expected in a few weeks, Djelic was quoted as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
