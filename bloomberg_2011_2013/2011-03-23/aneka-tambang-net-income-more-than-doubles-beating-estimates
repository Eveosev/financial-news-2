PT Aneka Tambang said net income
more than doubled last year and beat analystsâ€™ estimates as the
Indonesian state-owned nickel and gold producer maintained
strong sales revenue and reduced costs.  Net income jumped to 1.68 trillion rupiah ($192 million),
or 177 rupiah a share, from 604.3 billion rupiah, or 63 rupiah a
share, the Jakarta-based company said in a statement in Investor
Daily  Indonesia . That compares with a mean profit estimate from
17 analysts in a Bloomberg survey of 1.5 trillion rupiah.  Revenue rose 0.3 percent to 8.74 trillion rupiah, while
cost of goods sold reduced by 23 percent last year to 5.8
trillion rupiah, the company said. Antam reported unaudited
results on Feb. 28.  Aneka Tambang is benefitting from global economic recovery
that has boosted demand and prices of metals including copper
and nickel. Nickel rose about 34 percent on the London Metal
Exchange last year.  Antam, as the company is known, fell 1.2 percent to 2,150
rupiah a share in Jakarta at 9:38 a.m. The stock has fallen
about 11 percent this year, compared with a 5 percent drop on
the benchmark  Jakarta Composite index. (JCI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
