Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF) ,  Israel ’s
third-largest lender by market value, said fourth-quarter profit
almost doubled after an increase in interest income.  Net income rose to 222 million shekels ($62.7 million),
from 114 million shekels a year earlier, the Ramat Gan, Israel-
based bank said today in a statement.  The Bank of Israel raised its benchmark interest rate for a
second consecutive month on Feb. 21 after economic growth
accelerated to a four-year high of 7.7 percent in the last
quarter of 2010. That helped boost Mizrahi’s lending by 12
percent to 107 billion shekels while net interest income climbed
34 percent to 880 million shekels.  “Increase in financing income explains most of the gain in
the bank’s fourth-quarter results,” said Alon Glazer, an
analyst at Leader Capital Market Ltd. “Increase in credit to
the public and in interest rates will continue to contribute to
the lender’s earnings in 2011.”  Mizrahi fell 0.2 percent to 37.12 shekels as of 4:12 p.m.
