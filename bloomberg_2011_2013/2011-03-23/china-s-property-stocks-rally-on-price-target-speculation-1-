China ’s property stocks climbed the
most in more than two weeks in  Shanghai  trading on speculation
local governments will set targets for housing prices that are
higher than analysts’ estimates.  A gauge of 34 real estate stocks on the Shanghai Composite
Index jumped 2.7 percent at the 3 p.m. close, the most since
March 4. China Vanke Co., the nation’s biggest listed property
developer, rose 2.4 percent to 8.50 yuan. Poly Real Estate Group
Co., the second largest, advanced 3.9 percent to 13.29 yuan.  “There’s market speculation that local governments will
set a target of limiting housing price gains to between zero
percent and the GDP growth rate,” said Wang Weijun, a
strategist at Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai. “That’s much
better than the target of below zero percent anticipated by the
market.” Local governments may announce their price control
targets next week, Wang said.  China’s State Council, or the cabinet, ordered local
governments in January to set pricing control targets for newly
built houses while raising the minimum down payment for second-
home purchases. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on March 5 that China
will “resolutely” press ahead with controls on the  property
market  to curb speculation.  Home prices  in China’s 70 major cities climbed 6.4 percent
in December, the last month before the statistics bureau changed
its calculation methods. Prices rose last month in all but two
of the 70 cities, the bureau said on March 18. China’s economic
growth reached 10.3 percent last year, overtaking  Japan  as the
world’s second-largest economy.  The property index dropped 28 percent last year after the
government boosted down-payment requirements and ordered banks
to aside more money as reserves. Vanke’s valuation dropped to
9.4 times estimated earnings last week, the lowest for the
multiple since October 2008, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  gained 3.1 percent to 6.92 yuan. China
Merchants Property Development Co. climbed 3 percent to 17.30
yuan. The Shanghai Composite added 1 percent.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
