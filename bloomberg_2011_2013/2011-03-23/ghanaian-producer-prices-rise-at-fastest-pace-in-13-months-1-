Ghanaian  producer prices rose at
the fastest pace in 13 months in February as a jump in gasoline
prices the month before boosted costs to miners and
manufacturers in the West African nation.  Producer-price inflation accelerated to 22.3 percent from a
revised 20.9 percent in January, Sylvester Gyamfi, a
statistician at the Ghana Statistical Service, told reporters in
the capital, Accra, today. That was the highest since January
2010.  “Mining and quarrying costs as well as manufacturing costs
recorded big jumps in the month, due mainly to the January fuel
price increases,” Gyamfi said.  Ghana raised its fuel prices by 30 percent in January
following a rally in the global cost of oil. The move pushed the
consumer-price inflation rate up for the second consecutive
month in February. The rate climbed to 9.2 percent, from 9.1
percent a month earlier, the statistical service said March 9.  Mining and quarrying costs, which make up 14 percent of the
producer-price index, rose an annual 27.9 percent in February,
while manufacturing costs increased 11.2 percent, Gyamfi said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
