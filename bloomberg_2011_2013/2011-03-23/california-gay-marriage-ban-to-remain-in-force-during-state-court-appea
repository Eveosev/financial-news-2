A U.S. appeals court refused today
to lift an order keeping  California ’s gay marriage ban in effect
while a ruling invalidating the law is on appeal.  Proponents of California’s voter-approved ballot measure,
Proposition 8, are appealing a federal judge’s ruling in August
overturning the ban on same-sex marriage. It was the first
federal trial over whether it is legal to outlaw marriage by
people of the same sex.  In January, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in San Francisco
asked the California Supreme Court to decide whether Proposition
8’s supporters have legal standing to argue the case when
California officials have refused to do so.  The state’s high court justices could hear oral arguments
as early as September. Today’s order from the federal appeals
court will keep the marriage ban temporarily in place until the
state appeals questions are resolved.  The case is Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 10-16696, U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
