Celera Corp. (CRA) , the medical equipment
company being bought by Quest Diagnostics Inc. for $8 a share,
was sued by investors claiming the price is inadequate.  The New Orleans Employees’ Retirement System contends
directors are selling the company for less than it’s worth --
and less than the current stock price -- after restating some
financial figures.  “The board utterly failed to advance the interests of
Celera’s stockholders,” and the higher trading price is
“strong evidence that the Celera Board failed to maximize
value,” the retirees said in a complaint filed yesterday in
Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington and made public today.  Quest, based in Madison,  New Jersey , said in a March 18
statement that it would buy Alameda, California-based Celera in
a $344 million transaction to help strengthen its position in
molecular diagnostics.  In a March 18 earnings report, Celera said it had adjusted
some prior financial statements to reflect classification of bad
debt expenses, recognition of uncollectible charges and
accounting methods.  The retirees’ lawyers said in the complaint that the
restatements expose Celera directors to “possible liability”
under federal securities laws.  David Speechly, a Celera spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Celera rose 11 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $8.24 in Nasdaq
stock market trading at 1:33 p.m. in  New York .  The case is New Orleans Employees’ Retirement System v.
Ayers, CA6304, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
