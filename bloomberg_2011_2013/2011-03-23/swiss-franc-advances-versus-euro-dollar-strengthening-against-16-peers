The Swiss franc strengthened as
concern  Portugal ’s government may collapse deepened speculation
the euro-region debt crisis is intensifying.  The franc strengthened against all of its 16 most-traded
peers, rising for a second day versus the euro, as yields
climbed on Portuguese and Irish notes, boosting demand for the
perceived safety of Swiss assets. European Union policy makers
remain divided over how to get the region’s existing bailout
fund up to its full capacity of 440 billion euros ($624 billion)
before a two-day summit that starts tomorrow.  “Euro-Swiss franc has been a pressure valve for any
developments on the euro front,” said  Kenneth Broux , senior
market economist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London. The
pair is “the big one because of Portugal today,” he said.  The franc appreciated as much as 0.7 percent to 1.2741 per
euro and was at 1.2762 as of 8:56 a.m. in  London . It
strengthened 0.4 percent to 89.96 centimes per dollar.  Portuguese Prime Minister  Jose Socrates  will face a vote in
parliament today against his deficit-cutting plan, which
threatens to push the country toward early elections and the
need for a EU bailout. The opposition Social Democratic and
Communist parties both pledged yesterday to table resolutions
against the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
