European Central Bank council
member and Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  said central banks’
involvement in financial supervision mustn’t come at the expense
of their independence and inflation-fighting mandate.  Central Banks “already play, and should continue to play,
a prominent role in safeguarding financial stability,” Weber
said in a speech in Frankfurt today. “However, wherever central
banks are involved in financial supervision, it is imperative
that this does not compromise their independence and their
primary objective, which is to maintain price stability.”  The ECB has so far shouldered the main burden of fighting
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis by providing banks with unlimited
liquidity and buying  government bonds . The bond purchases were
criticized by Weber and some of his colleagues for stretching
the ECB’s mandate and posing potential inflation risks.  Weber said the economic slump showed that “crises are no
longer a purely national issue” and that there’s a “need for
an internationally coordinated reform of regulatory and
supervisory frameworks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
