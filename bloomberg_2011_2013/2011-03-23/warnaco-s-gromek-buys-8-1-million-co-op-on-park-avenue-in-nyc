Joseph R. Gromek, chief executive
officer of  Warnaco Group Inc. (WRC) , bought a co-op on Park Avenue in
 Manhattan  for $8.1 million, according to public records.  The purchase of the apartment at 1100 Park Ave. was
completed yesterday, New York City Department of Finance records
show. The four-bedroom corner co-op in the Carnegie Hill
neighborhood was listed by New York-based Warburg Realty with an
asking price of $9 million in March 2010, according to listings
website  StreetEasy.com . It was taken off the market in June then
relisted with a 9 percent price cut in September.  The 18-story tower that houses the co-op is described on
 CityRealty.com  as “one of the most interesting buildings on
Park Avenue,” with the exterior of its first three stories
covered in yellow marble. It was built in 1930 and converted
into a co-op in 1955 with about 80 units, according to the
property-listings website.  Deborah Abraham, vice president of  investor relations  at
New York-based Warnaco, did not immediately return a voicemail
seeking comment.  Gromek has led Warnaco, maker of Calvin Klein jeans and
Speedo swimwear, since 2003. He was president and chief
executive officer of Brooks Brothers, the New York-based men’s
clothing retailer, from 1996 to 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
