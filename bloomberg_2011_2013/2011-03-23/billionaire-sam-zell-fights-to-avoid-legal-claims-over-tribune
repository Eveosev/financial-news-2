Tribune Co. Chairman  Sam Zell  is
battling to avoid legal liability for leading what he called
“the deal from hell,” the $8.2 billion buyout of the bankrupt
newspaper and television company.  In court papers filed yesterday, Zell asked the judge
overseeing Tribune’s bankruptcy for permission to challenge a
lawsuit filed against him by creditors. The lawsuit seeks to
recover money from him, and other Tribune managers, whom
creditors blame for the company’s inability to repay about
$13 billion in debt, most of which is tied to the 2007 buyout.  “He is the one person who did nothing wrong,” David Bradford, Zell’s bankruptcy attorney, said in court yesterday, a
few hours before filing the latest round of court papers in
which the  Chicago  real estate billionaire denied responsibility
for Tribune’s insolvency.  Two groups of hedge funds have submitted competing plans to
reorganize Tribune and resolve billions of dollars worth of
legal claims related to the buyout. Both groups would allow a
federal lawsuit against Zell and Tribune’s other managers to go
forward.  Chicago-based Tribune filed bankruptcy in December 2008,
one year after the two-stage buyout was completed. The company
owns eight newspapers, including the  Los Angeles Times  and the
 Chicago Tribune , with a combined daily circulation of
1.9 million last year. The company’s 23 TV stations include
sites in  New York , Chicago and  Los Angeles .  The bankruptcy case is In re Tribune Co., 08-bk-13141,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
