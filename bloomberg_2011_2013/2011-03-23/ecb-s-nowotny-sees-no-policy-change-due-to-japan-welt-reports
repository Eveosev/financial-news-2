European Central Bank Governing
Board Council member Ewald Nowotny doesn’t expect the Japanese 
earthquake to alter the ECB's monetary policy,  Die Welt  
reported, citing an interview.  “I don’t personally see a fundamental change in the
situation we analyzed at our last meeting,” the newspaper
quoted Nowotny as saying in a preview of an interview to be
published tomorrow. “But naturally we must work out our
analysis still more carefully in the event of new findings.”  The European economy “is likely to be comparatively less
hard hit by the catastrophe in  Japan ,” Nowotny said, according
to the newspaper.  “The Asian states and  Australia  are much more closely
interwoven with Japan,” Nowotny was quoted as saying.
“However, it’s too early to make definite statements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
