Former  England  cricketer Fred
Titmus died today at age 78 after a long illness, his former
county club Middlesex said.  The offspinner played 53 Test matches for England, taking
153 wickets, after making his first-class debut for Middlesex in
1949 at 16 years and 213 days. He was the youngest-ever
Middlesex player at the time.  Titmus went on to play for more than three decades, making
his final appearance in 1982 at 50 years and 276 days. That made
him the fourth-oldest Middlesex player, and the oldest to appear
for the county at Lord’s in London.  “As a cricketer, there is no doubt whatsoever that Fred
Titmus was one of the best of postwar allrounders,” Middlesex
 said on its website . “Fred will be deeply missed by all those
who played with him and by all those who were fortunate enough
to have seen him performing for Middlesex and England.”  Titmus took his England wickets at an average of 32.22,
averaging 22.29 with the bat. His overall first-class figures
were 2,830 wickets at 22.37, batting for an average of 23.11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
