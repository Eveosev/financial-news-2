     March 23 (Bloomberg) --Henry Boot Plc, the U.K. property
company that built Pinewood film studios, reversed losses to
record full-year profit on signs of a recovering U.K. commercial
real estate market.  Net profit in the year to Dec. 31 rose to 11.8 million
pounds ($19.3 million), or 9.1 pence a share, compared with a
7.4 million pound loss in the year-earlier period, the company
said in a Regulatory News Service statement today. Sales climbed
13 percent to 131.9 million pounds.  “Whilst remaining challenging, the  property market  has
stabilized and is now showing some signs of recovery,” Chairman
John Reis said in the statement. “However, I continue to
believe that the recovery will be patchy and relatively long and
drawn out.”  Henry Boot said government staffing cuts within local
authority planning departments may affect the number of permits
granted over the coming years, the company said. The developer
said more than 20 percent of its land portfolio received local
government approval, compared with around 10 percent five years
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
