Belarus’s dollar bonds plunged,
lifting yields by record amounts to new highs, on concern the
former Soviet republic may be forced to devalue its ruble and
will struggle to repay its debt.  Yields on the country’s $1 billion of 2015 notes issued in
July climbed 183 basis points, or 1.83 percentage points, to
12.449 percent as of 6:15 p.m. in  London . Debt of $800 million
maturing in 2018 sold in January fell 5.4 percent to 85.10 cents
on the dollar, pushing the yield up 114 basis points to 12.22
percent. Belarus’s ruble lost 0.2 percent to 3,025 per dollar.  The market “has been gripped with fears of a possible
devaluation and even a sovereign default,”  Ivan Tchakarov ,
chief economist for Russia and the former  Soviet Union  at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed
research report. “Fears have been fuelled by declining foreign
reserves as Belarus struggles to contain a widening current-
account deficit.”  The country’s foreign reserves were at $2.9 billion in
December, down 33 percent from a year earlier, while its
current-account deficit was 15.6 percent of GDP last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In comparison,  Greece ’s
current-account deficit reached 15.3 percent of GDP in the third
quarter of 2008, and began 2010 at 12.2 percent before the
country had to turn to the European Union for a rescue loan.  Belarus asked Russia and its other former Soviet partners
for loans totaling $3 billion, Russian Finance Minister Alexei
Kudrin said on March 15.  ‘Large Refinancing’  “The market has suddenly become aware of Belarus’s large
refinancing requirements in 2011,” Anton Hauser, who helps
manage about 1.4 billion euros ($2 billion) at Erste Sparinvest
in Vienna and holds Belarus’s 2015 dollar notes, said by e-mail
today. Erste won’t sell its holdings of these bonds “as we bet
that  Russia  will increase their strategic leverage over them by
providing a loan,” he said.  Belarus is likely to devalue its ruble as it runs out of
foreign reserves because of an “intolerable” current-account
deficit, Danske Bank A/S wrote in a March 21 report.  The Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki Belarus, the central bank,
said on March 15 that it has no plans for a “sharp”  currency
devaluation . The Belarusian ruble will be allowed to fluctuate
within 8 percent of 1,057.04 rubles, the value of its target
basket at the start of the year, the bank said March 15. The
basket is divided equally into dollars, euros and Russian
rubles.  The central bank devalued its currency by about a fifth in
January 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
