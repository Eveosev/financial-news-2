Produce Buying Co., the biggest
buyer of cocoa from farmers in  Ghana , climbed to a more than
two-year high as cocoa prices rallied for a third day.  The stock rose 2 pesewas or 10 percent, to close at 22
pesewas by 3 p.m. in Accra, the highest since November 2008.  Cocoa for May delivery advanced as much as 1.4 percent to
2,118 pounds ($3,442) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London on
concern supplies of the beans may be further disrupted as
conflict escalates in  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest producer.
Neighboring Ghana is the second-biggest producer of the
chocolate ingredient.  “The company’s story is looking brilliant now; it has
posted positive results for some time now and this has caught
the attention of some African funds,” Hilary Lomotey, a trader
with  Renaissance Capital , said by phone from Accra today.  Net income for the first quarter through December climbed
17 percent to 8.4 million cedis ($5.5 million) as sales rose 43
percent to 329 million cedis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
