Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  investors,
gathered at an annual meeting today, voted against proposed
compensation packages for the computer makerâ€™s top executives.  At the same time, shareholders ratified a slate of 13
directors.  The vote against the pay packages may signal concern about
the agenda of Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker and Chairman
 Ray Lane , who took the helm on Nov. 1. Hewlett-Packard supported
both measures, while Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an
adviser to investors on corporate governance matters,
recommended that clients reject them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
