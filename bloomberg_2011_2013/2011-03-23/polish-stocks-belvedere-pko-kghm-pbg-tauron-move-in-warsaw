Poland ’s WIG20 Index rose 0.85, or
0.03 percent, to 2,768.96 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Belvedere SA (BVD)   sank 8.1 zloty, or 3.3 percent, to
237 zloty, falling for a second day. Chief Executive Officer
Jacques Rouvroy and his deputy lost a legal bid to recover
shares in the vodka-maker seized by London hedge funds in June.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, climbed 3.8 zloty, or 2.2 percent,
to 179.2 zloty, the highest close in more than two weeks. Copper
rose as orders to draw metal from inventories jumped the most in
11 months, feeding speculation that demand will outpace supply
in 2011.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest lender,
closed at 42.4 zloty, falling 0.25 zloty, or 0.6 percent as
Treasury Minister Aleksander Grad said the government is
“leaning toward” a public sale of its shares in a coordinated
effort with state bank BGK.  PBG SA (PBG)  , Poland’s biggest builder by market value,
slid for a fourth day, losing 4 zloty, or 2.1 percent, to 187
zloty as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its share-price estimate
4.1 percent to 209 zloty.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)   closed at 6.24 zloty, up
0.04 zloty, or 0.7 percent, after advancing as much as 1.9
percent. Poland said it won’t sell any more shares in its
second-largest power utility following yesterday’s offer of a 12
percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
