Private-jet passengers on planes
departing from U.K. airports will probably have to pay taxes
after Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said he’s
targeting the richest travelers in a revision of duties.  The government is consulting on how to improve the
country’s Airport Passenger Duty tax, Osborne said. Most
private-jet flights are exempt from the tax, which imposes  fees 
ranging from 12 pounds ($19.50) to 170 pounds on each airline
passenger, based on the distance to be flown.  “The wealthiest should not escape the tax the ordinary
holidaymaker has to pay,” Osborne told lawmakers in  London 
today.  The chancellor also said he would delay an increase to the
existing tax rates, planned for April, until next year, given
the “hefty duty rise" that took effect in November.  The  International Air Transport Association  said the freeze
in the  tax rate  was good for Britain. It said the tax should be
abandoned completely if U.K. airlines join the European Union’s
emissions trading system as scheduled in 2012.  The trade body estimates that the U.K. government collects
about 2 billion pounds from its aviation tax.  The Aviation Environment Federation praised Osborne’s
announcement on private-jet passengers, while criticizing the
refusal to raise the tax. It’s "well short of what would be
required to equalize aviation taxes with other sectors of the
economy," the London-based group said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
