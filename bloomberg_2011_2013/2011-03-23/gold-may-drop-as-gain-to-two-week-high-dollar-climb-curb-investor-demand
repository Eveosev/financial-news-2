Gold rose for the sixth straight
session, nearing a record in New York, as unrest in  Libya  and
the Middle East and  Europe ’s lingering debt crisis spurred
demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.
Silver rose to the highest since 1980.  A U.S.-led alliance is preparing to direct more attacks
against Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s ground forces, as
coalition members try to resolve disputes over who will take
command. European leaders will meet this week to seek a
permanent solution to the region’s debt crisis, amid concern
Portugal’s government will collapse today. Gold futures reached
a record $1,445.70 an ounce on March 7.  “There’s so much going on in the world that it’s hard to
find a reason not to own gold,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in  Chicago . “There’s a
flight-to-quality to metals across the board.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $10.40, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $1,438 at 1:34 p.m. on the Comex in New
York.  Crude-oil touched a two week-high on concern that supply
will be disrupted. A bomb exploded at a bus stop outside
Jerusalem killing one person and injuring at least 30, and
protesters clashed with the Syrian government. Stocks in Asia
fell after  Japan  said there were traces of radiation in Tokyo’s
tap water.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 92.9 cents, or 2.6
