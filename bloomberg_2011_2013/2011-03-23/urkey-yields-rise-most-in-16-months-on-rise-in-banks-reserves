Turkey ’s benchmark bond yields
jumped the most in 16 months and stocks slumped after the
central bank increased banks’  reserve requirements  for the third
time since December to stem credit growth.  Yields on benchmark two-year bonds rose 31 basis points to
8.90 percent, the biggest increase since Oct. 26, 2009, at 5:30
p.m. in Istanbul. The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of shares
dropped 1.8 percent to 63,719.64, led by banks.  “We should expect substantial pressure on t-bill rates”
after the central bank’s decision, Istanbul-based broker Oyak
Securities said in an e-mailed report to clients today.  Banks have sold bonds to pay for the higher reserve
requirements, with yields rising to as high as 9.11 percent on
March 8 from a record low of 6.9 percent in January. Banking
stocks have fallen 21 percent from a November high, partly on
concern the measure will hurt earnings.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , part-owned by Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA of  Spain , dropped 2.9 percent to 7.38
liras. Akbank TAS declined 3.6 percent to 7.38 liras.  The central bank today increased the reserve requirements
to 15 percent for lira deposits of less than one month from as
low as 10 percent. The measures, which include higher reserves
for all lira deposits of less than a year, will be effective
April 15, the bank said in a statement on its Web site.  The measure will drain 19.1 billion liras ($12.2 billion)
of liquidity from the market, the central bank said.  Istanbul-based broker Standard Unlu said it may cut
estimates for banks earnings this year and in 2012 after the
increase in reserves.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  is most exposed to losses from
 government bonds , with half of its interest income coming from
the debt. Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS is least exposed, Standard
Unlu said in an e-mailed report to investors today.  The central bank also left the benchmark one-week repo
lending rate unchanged for a second month. It had cut the rate
by a total of 0.75 percentage points in December and January to
help curb foreign capital inflows that had brought gains for the
lira and made exports less competitive in terms of price.  The lira rose 0.3 percent to 1.5584 per dollar.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
