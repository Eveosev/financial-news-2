Oil fell from the highest in more
than two years in  New York  on signs supplies are rising in the
U.S. and easing concern that unrest in the Middle East will
spread to Saudi Arabia, the region's largest crude exporter.  Futures slipped as much as 0.6 percent as Yemen’s Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to an opposition proposal to hand over
power by the end of the year and a report yesterday showed U.S.
crude stockpiles grew for a third week. Allied warplanes
continued “pressurizing Qaddafi’s forces” in  Libya  by
targeting government tanks, artillery, supply lines and
communications points, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Gerard Hueber
said yesterday.  “At least for the moment, there doesn’t seem to be the
immediate concern of the political situation in the Middle East
spreading to  Saudi Arabia , like we had a few weeks ago,” said
Mark Keenan, chief investment officer of Cubit Asset Management
Pte in Singapore.  Crude for May delivery declined as much as 64 cents to
$105.11 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , and was at $105.49 at 3:16 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, the contract climbed 78 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $105.75, the highest since Sept. 26, 2008.  Brent oil for May settlement slid 11 cents, or 0.1 percent,
to $115.44 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Yesterday, it fell 15 cents to $115.55.  Crude inventories climbed 2.13 million barrels to 352.8
million, the Energy Department said yesterday. Supplies were
forecast to increase 1.5 million barrels, according to a
Bloomberg News survey.  Cushing Supplies  Crude stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for West Texas oil, rose 177,000 barrels to 40.2 million last
week, the Energy Department report showed. Supplies increased to
40.3 million in the week ended March 4, the highest since the
department began collecting data at the hub in 2004.  Total U.S. crude inventories rose for a third week,
climbing to 352.8 million in the seven days ended March 18, the
Energy Department data showed. Gasoline stockpiles fell 5.32
million barrels to 219.7 million, the lowest level since
December. Supplies were forecast to decline by 2 million barrels,
according to the Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Total fuel demand increased 1 percent to 19.3 million
barrels a day, the Energy Department report showed. Gasoline
consumption climbed 2.8 percent to 9.07 million barrels a day.  Regional Unrest  Purchases of new U.S. homes declined in February to the
slowest pace on record, figures from the Commerce Department
showed yesterday in  Washington .  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said the British
economy will grow more slowly than previously forecast in 2011.
The  Office for Budget Responsibility  predicts annual growth in
2011 of 1.7 percent, down from the 2.1 percent forecast in
November, Osborne said.  Oil in New York has advanced 15 percent this year as
turmoil that toppled the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt  extended
to Yemen, Bahrain and Oman.  The international coalition is “pressurizing Qaddafi’s
forces” by targeting government tanks, artillery, supply lines
and communications points, said Rear Admiral Gerard Hueber of
the U.S. Navy. Libyan government troops increased their attacks,
killing 16 people yesterday in embattled Misrata and six in the
nearby coastal town of Zentan, opposition spokesman Abdulhafid
Ghoga said.  Syrian troops are forcing people to stay at home in the
southern city of Daraa after seven people were killed in renewed
anti-government protests that have swept across the country,
 Amnesty International  said yesterday. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh won backing from parliament to enforce emergency
rule, while agreeing to hand over power by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
