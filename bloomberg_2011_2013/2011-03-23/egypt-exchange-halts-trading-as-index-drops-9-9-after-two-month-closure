Egyptâ€™s stock change halted trading
after the EGX 100 Index declined 7 percent as trading resumed
after an almost two-month closure amid protests that led to the
ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak . The benchmark EGX 30 dropped
9.9 percent.  Finance Minister Samir Radwan said trading was suspended.  The Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority, which
regulates financial markets, said last month that trading will
be halted for 30 minutes if the EGX 100 Index falls more than 5
percent. If the drop extends to 10 percent, trading will be
suspended for a period to be set by the head of the exchange.  The EGX 30 slumped 16 percent in the week that ended Jan.
