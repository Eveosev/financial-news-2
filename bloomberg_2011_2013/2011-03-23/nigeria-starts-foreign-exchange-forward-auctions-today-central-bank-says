Nigeria  will start foreign exchange
forwards auctions today with authorized dealers required to bid
for a minimum of $500,000 for period of one, two or three
months, the  Central Bank of Nigeria  said.  “Authorized dealers are only allowed to sell the forwards
bought from the CBN” to their customers, the Abuja-based
central bank said in a statement on its website yesterday.  Foreign currency forwards bought from the central bank are
not transferable in the inter-bank market, it said. The bank
will announce on Wednesdays the dates on which each contract
will mature, and release the results of each sale by 4 p.m. on
the day of auction, according to the statement.  The Monetary Policy Committee at its meeting yesterday
urged the bank to “continue to pursue the strategy of
maintaining exchange rate stability to contain inflation,”
according to a statement on its website. The bank has kept the
naira at about 150 to the dollar since January 2009.  Policy makers raised the monetary policy rate by 1
percentage point to 7.5 percent.  The foreign exchange forwards auctions are “part of the
CBN’s strategy to ensure that exchange rate stability is
preserved around the 150 USD/NGN level,”  Samir Gadio , emerging-
markets strategist at London-based Standard Bank Plc, said today
in an e-mailed response to a question.  To contact the reporter on this story:
