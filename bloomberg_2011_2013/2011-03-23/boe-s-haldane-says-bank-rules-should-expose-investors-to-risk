Andrew Haldane , the  Bank of
England ’s Executive Director for Financial Stability, said new
rules to manage banks should ensure investors bear the
consequences of risks.  Bank regulations should “set the overarching rules of the
game,” Haldane said in a speech delivered on Jan. 9 in Denver
and released by the central bank today. “In tackling banking
stress, that means the framework for banks’ capital structure.”  He said that “as far as possible, that framework should
aim to leave the pricing of risk ex-ante, and the consequences
of risk ex-post, to the market.”  “Nothing could be less radical than returning banks, and
banking risk, to the market,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
