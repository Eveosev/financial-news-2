Core Projects & Technologies Ltd. (CPTL) ,
an Indian education software services provider to universities
overseas, said it plans to spend $45 million on acquiring two
companies abroad.  Core will buy a U.K.-based company that provides training
to teachers for $30 million, and one in the Middle East, which
provides services to colleges and universities, for about $15
million, Sanjeev Mansotra, chairman and managing director, said
in an interview in Mumbai. The company will use $25 million of
its own cash and raise debt to fund the purchases, he said.  The transactions will be announced in two-to-three weeks,
he said today.  The company expects revenue of 11 billion rupees in the
year ending this month and profit of 2 billion to 2.2 billion
rupees, Mansotra said, forecasting revenue growth of 25 percent
in 12 months ending March 31, 2012, and net income expansion of
at least 20 percent. Order backlog stands at 13.5 billion rupees,
he said. Core reported earnings of 1.72 billion rupees and sales
of 8.5 billion rupees in fiscal 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Core shares added 0.9 percent to close at 325.5 rupees, a
fourth day of gain and the highest level in almost three months.
The stock has climbed 12 percent this year, compared with a 15
percent plunged in the 293-member  BSE Mid-Cap Index. (BSEMDCAP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
