Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , the terminal
arm of China’s biggest shipping group, said it may put some
operations in a business trust following Hutchison Port Holdings
Trust’s  Singapore  trading debut earlier this month.  “We are looking at it comprehensively,” Deputy Managing
Director Kelvin Wong told reporters today in Hong Kong. “The
steady  cash flow  from our port business has attracted many
investment bankers to come and tell us the benefits of port
trusts.”  Forming a trust may help boost returns for investors as
Cosco Pacific’s dividend yield trails trusts’ payouts, Wong
said. HPH Trust, which raised $5.5 billion in its Singapore IPO,
offered a projected yield of 5.89 percent, according to people
familiar with the situation.  Cosco Pacific, controlled by  China  Cosco Holdings Co., has
no definite plans for a trust, Wong said. He didn’t comment on
which assets could be put into one. The company has a projected
12-month dividend yield of 2.3 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, which also runs the world’s third-largest
container-lessor and holds a stake in a box maker, plans capital
expenditure of about $1 billion this year, about the same as
2010, said Financial Controller Eddie Lui. The plan includes
spending $620 million on port facilities and $380 million on
buying new containers, he said.  Profit Doubles  Cosco Pacific more than doubled 2010 net income to $361.3
million, it said in a statement to the city’s stock exchange
today. That was in line with the $358.4 million average of 17
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. It proposed a final
dividend of 2.48 U.S. cents.  The terminal operator dropped 2.2 percent to HK$14.54 at
the close of trading in  Hong Kong . The company has advanced 7.4
percent this year. HPH Trust, the holder of terminals in Hong
Kong and southern China, rose 0.5 percent to 97.5 U.S. cents in
Singapore, compared with its $1.01 IPO price.  Container volumes across Cosco Pacific’s terminal
operations rose 19 percent to 48.5 million 20-foot boxes last
year, as world trade rebounded from the global recession. The
company has stakes in about 20 cargo-handlers, predominately in
China and Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
