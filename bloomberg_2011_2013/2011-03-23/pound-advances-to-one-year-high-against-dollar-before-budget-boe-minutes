The pound slumped as  Bank of
England  minutes showed policy makers see “merit in waiting” to
examine oil prices’ effect on the economy and the U.K.’s budget
watchdog cut its growth forecast.  Sterling fell below $1.63 after topping $1.64 for the first
time in more than a year yesterday. It depreciated against all
16 of its major peers. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  raised next year’s borrowing target in today’s budget
speech and said the  Office for Budget Responsibility  now sees
economic growth in 2011 of 1.7 percent, down from November’s 2.1
percent forecast. Gilts rose as the central bank minutes showed
a 6-3 vote to keep interest rates on hold on March 10.  “The March minutes suggested to me that there is a
significant feeling in the Monetary Policy Committee that they
should wait and see what the data brings, and what the
government austerity drive brings,” said Jane Foley, a senior
foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank International in  London .
“They’ll be very hard pressed to hike rates before July, and on
my take they will wait for even longer. That leaves the pound on
the back foot.”  The pound dropped 0.7 percent to $1.6246 as of 4:41 p.m. in
London. It yesterday reached $1.6401, the strongest level since
Jan. 19, 2010. Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to 86.91 pence per
euro, after earlier touching 86.55, the strongest in a week.  The yield on 10-year gilts was four basis points lower at
3.56 percent, resuming its descent after Osborne finished
speaking and the Debt Management Office announced its plans for
securities issuance. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2020
climbed 0.32, or 3.2 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,640) face
amount, to 101.52.  Borrowing Targets  The government will borrow 122 billion pounds in 2011-12,
up from a prior forecast of 117 billion pounds. Borrowing will
fall to 101 billion pounds in 2012-13. Osborne said borrowing to
fund the deficit this fiscal year will be 146 billion pounds.  “The rise in public-sector borrowing over the medium term
points to gilt issuance remaining relatively high,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , an Edinburgh-based fixed-income strategist at RIA
Capital Markets Ltd., a broker for banks and investors.  The DMO said it planned to issue 169 billion pounds of
gilts in 2011-12, 1.6 percent higher than the total in the year
that ends next week. The sum includes eight syndications through
banks and 15 auctions of 18.6 billion pounds of inflation-linked
securities.  DMO Syndications  The DMO also announced today that it will consult gilt
primary dealers and so-called end-investors, such as funds, on
March 28 regarding gilt issuance in the April-June period. The
agency expects to hold two syndicated offerings in the fiscal
first quarter of 2011-12.  The Bank of England minutes showed policy maker  Andrew Sentance  maintained his call to raise the benchmark interest
rate to 1 percent from a record low of 0.5 percent, while  Martin
Weale  and  Spencer Dale  wanted a move to 0.75 percent. The other
six members, including Governor  Mervyn King , voted to maintain
the current level.  The U.K. currency had surged yesterday after data showed
consumer prices accelerated more than economists forecast,
boosting speculation that monetary policy would be tightened.
Britain’s inflation rate rose to 4.4 percent in February, more
than twice the central bank’s target.  ‘Greedy Bulls’  “The negative reaction in sterling must have been among
the more greedy bulls, who may have hoped for another dissenting
vote for a hike,” said  Daragh Maher , deputy head of global
foreign-strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank
in London. “The BOE most likely wants to wait another month or
two before making a judgment on how sustainable the recovery is,
so it was a bit premature of sterling bulls to hope for
something today in terms of the minutes.”  Short-sterling futures rose, sending the yield on the
contract expiring in December down four basis points to 1.44
percent, as traders pared bets on a U.K. rate increase.  The U.K. ten-year breakeven rate, an indication of
investors’ inflation expectations over the life of the
securities, derived from the yield gap between conventional and
index-linked bonds, fell for the first day in five. The rate
declined four basis points to 3.20 percent.  Sterling has gained 1.8 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. It trails the euro’s 3.4 percent
advance, the Swedish krona and Norwegian krone.  U.K. government debt has handed investors a 0.5 percent
loss this year, compared with a 1.8 percent drop for German
bonds and 0.5 percent return for U.S. Treasuries, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
