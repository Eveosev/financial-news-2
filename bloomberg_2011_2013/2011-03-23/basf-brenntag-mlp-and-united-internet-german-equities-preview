German stocks advanced for a second
day as carmakers climbed and Portugal’s prime minister resigned,
bringing the country closer to getting a bailout from the rest
of the European Union.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  rose.  BASF SE (BAS) 
jumped 3.4 percent after forecasting higher earnings. K+S AG
gained after CA Cheuvreux added the stock to its list of
preferred chemical-industry shares.  Metro AG (MEO) ,  Germany ’s biggest
retailer, rallied 3.4 percent after ING Groep NV recommended
buying the stock.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  rose 1.9 percent to 6,933.58 in
 Frankfurt . Last week, the gauge tumbled the most in 10 months
after  Japan ’s March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami damaged
cooling systems at an atomic power plant, causing the worst
nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The broader HDAX Index also
advanced 1.9 percent today.  “We don’t know what to make of the situation with
Portugal,” said Yves Marcais, an equity sales trader at Global
Equities in Paris. “ Portugal  has made efforts, but they aren’t
sufficient. In the market today, the focus is on stock
picking.”  In Portugal,  Jose Socrates  tendered his resignation after
the country’s parliament rejected his plan to cut the budget,
pushing the country closer to an international bailout.  President Anibal Cavaco Silva said late yesterday he will
meet the main parties tomorrow and the government will retain
its powers until he accepts Socrates’s resignation. Parliament
voted hours before European Union leaders meet in Brussels to
approve measures aimed at drawing a line under the euro area’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  BMW, Daimler Jump  BMW and Daimler, the world’s largest makers of luxury cars,
surged 4.2 percent to 57.60 euros and 3.5 percent to 49.02
euros, respectively. European carmakers posted the best
performance among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600 today,
climbing 3.2 percent.  BASF climbed 3.4 percent to 58.37 euros. The world’s
biggest chemicals company predicted sales and earnings before
interest, taxes and extraordinary items to be “significantly”
higher in the first quarter 2011 than a year earlier.  K+S increased 3.1 percent to 53.05 euros. The stock was
added to Cheuvreux’s best-picks list for the chemicals industry.  “We believe the potash market is entering a protracted
period of steady growth,” the analysts wrote.  Metro added 3.4 percent to 49.54 euros as ING raised its
recommendation on the retailer to “buy” from “hold.”  Brenntag AG (BNR)  gained 4.3 percent to 73.53 euros. The
chemicals distributor said full-year after-tax profit rose to
146.6 million euros ($207.9 million) from 500,000 euros as
revenue increased.  Strong Start  Evotec AG (EVT)  surged 5.1 percent to 3.09 euros. The drug
development company said full-year net income more than doubled
to 3 million euros, adding that it had a strong start to 2011.  Salzgitter AG (SZG)  increased 4.8 percent to 55.45 euros. The
stock was raised to “overweight” from “neutral” at HSBC
Holdings Plc.  SAF-Holland SA (SFQ)  surged 14 percent to 8.29 euros. The company
