France  plans to modify rules to
allow for public consultation when awarding permits for oil and
natural gas exploration, Environment Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet said.  “The mining code is old and allows for insufficient
consultations” on oil and gas exploration licenses, she said
today in parliament in Paris. Changes that will allow for public
deliberations on permit applications will be put to lawmakers
before April 20, she said.  The government has been criticized by environmental groups
and lawmakers for granting permits to companies including Total
SA and Toreador Resources Corp. to search for shale gas and oil
using hydraulic fracturing techniques that break rock formations
underground. Prime Minister Francois Fillon earlier this month
extended a ban on the search for of the unconventional fuels
until two reports are published in June.  Shale explorers in France had started drilling in some
cases or were preparing to begin in permits awarded by the
government in the Paris Basin area around the capital and in the
country’s south. Environmental groups have said drilling risks
contaminating the water supply because chemicals are used when
blasting shale to extract resources, a method that has also met
opposition in the U.S.  Under existing rules, the French Energy Ministry grants
permits through tenders without holding public consultations or
environmental studies. These can be carried out if explorers
want to move toward production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
