U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said today that Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  can end
international military action in his country by leaving office.  Qaddafi has “lost his legitimacy” to lead by attacking
his own people. The goal of international military action,
however, was to protect civilians and not to oust Qaddafi, she
said today at the State Department.  Clinton said the international military operation in  Libya 
has already saved lives and would continue with the U.S.
expecting to transfer command and control to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization soon.  Addressing reporters after a meeting with visiting Foreign
Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri of  Morocco , Clinton praised recent
reforms announced by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI, saying they
were a “model” for the whole Arab region.  Speaking on television on March 10, King Mohammed promised
to allow religious freedom and more transparent justice and said
the prime minister would come from an elected party. He pledged
to create a committee to review the North African nation’s
constitution by June, and hold a referendum on the changes
shortly after.  Clinton also addressed the demands for more democracy from
the opposition in Yemen, an uprising that threatens to oust
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has been in office for 32
years and is a U.S. ally in the fight against al-Qaeda.  “People in Yemen have the same rights as people
everywhere,” Clinton said, adding that the U.S. has made its
views known to the Yemeni government, both in public and in
private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
