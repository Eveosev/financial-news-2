Taiwan’s dollar weakened for the
first time in three days on concern higher  oil prices , spurred
by military conflict in  Libya , will hamper the global economic
recovery.  The currency fell the most in a week as crude oil traded
near a two-week high. Global funds sold more Taiwanese stocks
than they bought on each of the past 11 days, the longest run of
net sales since February 2010, exchange data show. Allied
airstrikes focused on Libya’s air defenses have not ended
attacks on civilians by forces loyal to leader  Muammar Qaddafi ,
according to U.S. Admiral Samuel Locklear, the tactical
commander of the alliance.  “Surging oil prices will be a threat to the currency,”
said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based bond trader at Polaris Securities
Co. “There’s a lot of uncertainties in the markets at the
moment. Investors are still staying on the sidelines.”  Taiwan ’s dollar weakened 0.2 percent to NT$29.585 against
its U.S. counterpart as of its 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc.  Government bonds  were little changed before the Ministry of
Finance announced after the market closed it planned to sell a
total NT$170 billion ($5.7 billion) of debt in the next three
months, compared with NT$145 billion sold in the first quarter.
The coming quarter’s issuance includes NT$30 billion of 20-year
debt in May to fund transport infrastructure.  The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021, the
most-traded government debt, closed little changed at 1.354
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
