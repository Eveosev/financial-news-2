Ghana ’s currency, the cedi, was
little changed after the central bank sold dollars to meet
rising demand for foreign exchange.  The cedi declined less than 0.1 percent to 1.5330 per
dollar as of 1:16 p.m. in  Accra , from 1.5325 at the close of
market yesterday, according to data from the local unit of
Standard Bank Group Ltd.  “They didn’t put enough money on the market to move the
rate but just to meet demand” for dollars, Chris Nettey, a
currency trader with Stanbic Bank Ghana Ltd., said by phone.  Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury at the  Bank of Ghana ,
confirmed the institution sold dollars and declined to say how
much. The cedi’s exchange rate is “within the range that we
expect,” he said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
