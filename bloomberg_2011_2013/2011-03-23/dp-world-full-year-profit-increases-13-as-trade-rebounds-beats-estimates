DP World Ltd. (DPW) , the Dubai
government-controlled ports operator, reported a better-than-
expected 13 percent increase in full-year profit helped by a
rebound in global trade and improved profit margins.  Net income  rose to $374.8 million from $332.9 million a
year earlier, the world’s fourth-biggest port operator said in a
statement to Nasdaq Dubai today. That beat the $324.5 million
mean of 11 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Ebitda
margin, a measure of profitability, improved to 40.3 percent in
the year from 38 percent in 2009.  Last year “saw a return to volume growth across almost all
our terminals,” Chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem said in the
statement. Traffic at almost all facilities has also returned to
or surpassed 2008 levels, “a peak year for the global container
terminal industry,” he said.  DP World said Jan. 25 that volumes handled at its 28
terminals worldwide grew 9 percent in 2010 to 27.8 million
twenty-foot-equivalent containers, as global trade recovered.
Including an additional 22 terminals that DP World manages
without consolidating them in its financial results, annual
volume grew 14 percent to 49.6 million.  “In the first two months of 2011 we have seen 12 percent
volume growth across our consolidated portfolio with further
margin improvement from the full year 2010,” Chief Executive
Officer Mohammed Sharaf said in the statement today.  Australia Sale  DP World in December agreed to sell a 75 percent stake in
its Australian unit to a group led by Citigroup Inc. for A$1.5
billion ($1.5 billion) as part of a plan to reduce debt and
focus on more profitable markets. DP World completed the deal
March 11, Sharaf said today at a news conference in Dubai. The
company is open to opportunities to monetize assets, he said.  Container volumes at the port operator, majority-owned by
Dubai World, fell 8 percent in 2009 as the worldwide recession
eroded demand for sea-cargo shipments. Global trade in goods and
services rose 12 percent in 2010 and will increase 7.1 percent
in 2011 after having contracted 10.7 percent in 2009, according
to the  International Monetary Fund .  Political unrest that ousted presidents in Tunisia and
 Egypt  has spread to Gulf countries including Bahrain and Oman.  “Despite continuing economic fragility and political
turbulence in some parts of the world, given the geographic
spread of our portfolio, we remain confident that we will make
further progress in 2011,” Sharaf said.  London Stock Exchange  The company doesn’t plan to raise funds in the near-term.
“Unless we have an opportunity that we have not as yet
identified, we don’t see ourselves accessing capital markets
either on the debt side or on the equity side for the business
that we have today, for the foreseeable future,” Chief
Financial Officer Yuvraj Narayan said at the news conference.  The company fell 0.3 percent to 60 cents at the close in
Dubai. The stock has fallen 5.4 percent this year. DP World is
proceeding with plans to list shares on the London Stock
Exchange, the company said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
