Canada ’s prairies had temperatures
that were 1 degree to 3 degrees Celsius above normal last week,
allowing “significant melting” of snow, the Canadian Wheat
Board said in a  statement  on its website.  Daily highs were 3 degrees Celsius (37 degrees Fahrenheit)
to 13 degrees Celsius, the Wheat Board said. Over the weekend, a
storm system brought rain to southern growing areas, expediting
the snow melt. “While the snowpack is quickly depleting, there
are only a handful of areas where the snow is completely gone,”
the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
