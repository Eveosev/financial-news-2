There’s no evidence for now that
radioactivity from a leaking nuclear plant in Japan contaminated
food produced in any other country, the  United Nations  said.  Some food in Japan probably is contaminated with
radioactive material at levels that make it unsuitable for human
consumption, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and
 World Health Organization  said in an  online briefing  dated March
21.  The U.S. barred imports of milk and fresh produce yesterday
from four Japanese regions closest to radiation leaks from  Tokyo 
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. Tokyo
authorities said today city tap water may be unsafe for infants
because of radiation levels.  “Radioactive material falling from the air or carried in
rainwater or snow can deposit on the surface of foods like
fruits and vegetables or animal feed,” the UN agencies said.  Reports indicate the main contaminant in  Japan  has been
radioactive iodine, which has a half-life of eight days and
decays naturally within weeks, the FAO and WHO said. If
ingested, the iodine can accumulate in the body and raise the
risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children, they said.  Japan was hit by its strongest earthquake on record on
March 11, followed by a tsunami that devastated the northern
coastline and forced hundreds of thousands of people to
evacuate. The flood wave crippled the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant
north of Tokyo, knocking out cooling systems and causing
radiation leaks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
