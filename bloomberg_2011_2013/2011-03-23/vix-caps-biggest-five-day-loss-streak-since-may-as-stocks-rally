The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options fell for a fifth day, losing 35 percent for the biggest
five-day slide since May, and declined below its level before
the Japan earthquake as stocks rallied around the world.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell 5.2 percent to 19.17 as of 4:15 p.m. in  New
York . The index measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which
advanced 0.3 percent.  “Fear isn’t the first thing on people’s minds,” said
Nicole T. Wachs, an options analyst TradeKing Inc. in Charlotte,
 North Carolina . “People are weighing decisions about how to
make investments rather than ‘How can I buy protection?’ or ‘How
can I get out of the way?’ That’s what’s making the difference
right now.”  U.S. stocks rose, erasing yesterday’s drop, as higher metal
prices lifted commodity shares, while oil gained as allied
forces struck Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s troops. Copper
rallied 2.7 percent amid a jump in orders. The  S&P 500  erased
most of yesterday’s 0.4 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
