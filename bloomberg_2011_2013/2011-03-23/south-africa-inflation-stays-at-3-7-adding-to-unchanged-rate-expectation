South African inflation was
unchanged at 3.7 percent in February, giving the central bank
room to keep interest rates on hold tomorrow even as food and
fuel prices climb.  Prices rose 0.7 percent in the month, the Pretoria-based
statistics office said on its  website  today. Annual inflation
was in line with the median estimate of 22 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Reserve Bank  Governor  Gill Marcus , who cut the benchmark
interest rate three times to 5.5 percent last year, said on
March 15 that the “upside risks” to inflation have increased
because of rising food and fuel prices. She may give further
indications on the outlook for inflation when announcing the
rate decision tomorrow. All 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
expect the rate to stay unchanged.  “Inflation is forecast to move gradually higher over the
next four months on rising global food and fuel prices,” said
 Carmen Altenkirch , an economist at Nedbank Group Ltd. in
Johannesburg. “The risk of a rate hike earlier than what we are
currently anticipating has increased.” Nedbank is forecasting a
rate increase in the first quarter of 2012.  The rand was at 6.9204 against the dollar as of 11:25 a.m.
in Johannesburg from 6.9197 before the data was released. The
yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, fell 4 basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.8 percent.  Crude oil for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  has risen 13 percent this year. It climbed as much as
41 cents to $105.38 a barrel today, the highest price since
March 9, and was at $105.21 barrel at 9:39 a.m. London time.  The government increased gasoline prices by 3 percent on
Feb. 2 after raising them by 3.3 percent on Jan. 5.  The Reserve Bank cut its key rate to a 30-year low last
year to spur  consumer spending  and economic growth, which the
bank expects to reach 3.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
