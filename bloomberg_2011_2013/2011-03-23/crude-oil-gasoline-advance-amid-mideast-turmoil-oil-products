Crude oil  and gasoline advanced as
the U.S. and its allies attacked Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
troops and protesters clashed with government forces in  Syria ,
bolstering concern supplies will be disrupted. Heating oil and
ethanol slipped.  Crude Oil  Crude oil for May delivery rose 78 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $105.75 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008. The May contract has
gained 6.9 percent in the past week.  “Prices are moving up because of the fear premium,” said
Todd Horwitz, chief strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in  New
York . “Oil inventories continue to build but nobody cares
because they are afraid about what’s taking place in the Middle
East. The fundamentals don’t matter right now.”  U.S. crude inventories rose 2.13 million barrels to 352.8
million last week, the Energy Department reported. Supplies were
forecast to climb by 1.5 million barrels, according to the
median of 15 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline  Gasoline for April delivery gained for the third straight

weeks. Days of supply dropped to 24.2 from 24.8.  Heating Oil  Heating oil for April delivery dropped 2.12 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $3.055 a gallon, after reaching a two-week
