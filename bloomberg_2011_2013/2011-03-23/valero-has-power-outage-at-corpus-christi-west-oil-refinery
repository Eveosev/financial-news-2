Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  is restarting
production units at its Corpus Christi West refinery in Texas
after a power loss yesterday.  “Production units are currently powering up and are
expected to be in production soon,”  Bill Day , a spokesman for
Valero in  San Antonio , said in an e-mail.  The refinery lost power at 8:20 p.m. local time yesterday,
according to a  filing  with the Texas Commission of Environmental
Quality showed.  The plant has the capacity to process 200,000 barrels a day
of crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Valero’s Corpus Christi refinery complex consists of an
East and West plant about a mile apart, which have a combined
capacity of about 315,000 barrels a day, according to the
company’s website. The West plant mostly produces reformulated
gasoline and ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
