Nigerâ€™s ruling junta operation to
fight against financial crime has recovered 6.5 billion FCFA
improperly collected or removed from state coffers under former
President Mamadou Tandja, currently in jail for corruption,
Committee on Financial Moralization Chairman Abdoul Karim Mossi
said at a press conference in Niamey.   The commission inspections also allowed the freezing of the
$535,258,000 FCFA in a bank pending a court decision, Mossi
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
