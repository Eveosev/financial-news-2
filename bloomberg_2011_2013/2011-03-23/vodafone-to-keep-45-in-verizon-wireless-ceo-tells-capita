Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  aims to keep its
45 percent stake in U.S. operator  Verizon Wireless  and will talk
to its partner at the end of the year about getting a dividend
from the venture, Chief Executive Officer Vittorio Colao told
German magazine Capital.  Colao currently sees “no reason to divest this excellent
company,” he was quoted as saying.  The publication interviewed Colao before  AT&T Inc. (T)  said on
March 20 that it agreed to buy  T-Mobile USA  from Deutsche
Telekom AG in a deal valued at about $39 billion. The
acquisition would allow AT&T, the second-largest U.S. wireless
operator, to surpass Verizon Wireless as the biggest in the
country. A Vodafone spokesman confirmed Colao’s comments today.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , which owns the rest of mobile-
phone operator Verizon Wireless, said in January it may pay a
“fair dividend” to Vodafone. It would be the first payment
from their venture since 2005 as the U.S. operator withheld the
dividend to focus on paying down debt. Vodafone will probably
discuss the matter with Verizon at the end of the year, Colao
told Capital.  Vodafone wants to grow in emerging markets, where its units
have an average growth of 10 percent compared with no growth in
Europe, according to the magazine. The Vodafone CEO was quoted
as saying that prices for emerging market assets are “much too
high.” The company decided against buying several African
operators which were then acquired by rivals, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
