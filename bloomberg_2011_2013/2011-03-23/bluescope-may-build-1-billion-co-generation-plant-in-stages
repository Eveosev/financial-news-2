BlueScope Steel Ltd. (BSL) ,  Australia ’s
largest steelmaker, may have to develop a stalled A$1 billion
($1 billion) co-generation plant in stages, citing capital
constraints and government plans for a carbon tax.  The project, on hold since 2008, may be broken “into five
or six smaller projects over a period of a decade or more,”
Michael Reay, manager of corporate affairs of the Melbourne-
based company, said in a phone interview. The company scrapped
plans to construct the plant before a 2012 deadline and may
build it stages, the Australian Financial Review reported today.  BlueScope, which reported a first-half loss, began a review
of the project at Port Kembla in New South Wales state more than
two years ago during the global financial crisis. The government
plans to introduce a carbon price next year before moving to
 emissions trading  as early as 2015.  “Our capital investments are currently restricted to
ensuring operational security, there’s not a lot of other
capital that we could invest,” said Reay. “The carbon tax is
adding to the uncertainty.”  BlueScope shares fell 1.3 percent to A$1.915 at 1:54 p.m.
local time in Sydney trading, taking losses so far this year to
15 percent.  A co-generation plant uses surplus gas from iron and
steelmaking to produce electricity and steam. The company
flagged in February 2009 that the plant may be built in stages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
