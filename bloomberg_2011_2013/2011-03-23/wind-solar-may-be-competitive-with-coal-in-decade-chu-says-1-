Wind and solar power may compete
with fossil fuels, without aid from government subsidies, within
the next decade, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said.  “It’s not going to be three decades,” Chu said today at
an event in  Washington  sponsored by the  Pew Charitable Trust .  Chu is calling for a national  energy policy  that will
promote the use of clean-energy technologies. The U.S. should
invest in advanced battery technologies, biofuels and efficient
high-voltage transmission systems, Chu said.  China  and other nations are promoting policies to support
cleaner energy.  “This is a race,” he said.  Small, modular nuclear reactors, less than a third the size
of current units, are “much, much safer” than traditional
reactors, which remain safe, Chu said.  Chu was speaking about the role that future generations of
nuclear reactors might play in U.S. energy policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
