President Richard W. Fisher said the markets are underestimating
 Spain ’s ability to repay its debt.  “Spain has probably done more corrective surgery that
people don’t realize,” the regional bank chief, who votes on
monetary policy this year, told reporters after a speech
organized by the  American Academy  in Berlin.  “It’s my personal opinion” that Spain is “doing a very
good job and I think the market will come to realize that over
time,” he said.  “I think Spain is going to surprise people and personally
I am surprised it’s not priced into the market,” Fisher said.
“I would not equate Spain to the situation in Greece or
Portugal.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
