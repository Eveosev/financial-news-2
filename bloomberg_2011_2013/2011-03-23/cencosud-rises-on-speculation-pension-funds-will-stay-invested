Cencosud SA advanced the most in
two years in Santiago on speculation that pension funds will
retain their stakes in  Chile ’s largest retailer by sales.  Cencosud climbed 4.3 percent to 3,475 pesos at 1:27 p.m.
New York time and earlier advanced 6.4 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since January 2009.  Some investors are betting that Cencosud’s controller Horst Paulmann reduced his stake after the pension regulator reduced
on Jan. 18 the limit that funds can hold in companies in which
the controlling shareholder owns more than 65 percent, said
Rodrigo Jacob, head of research at Banco BICE’s brokerage unit.  “There were a couple of big block trades today and the
speculation is that Paulmann is the seller,” Jacob said by
phone. “By reducing his holding, he would allow pension funds
to retain theirs and comply with investment limits.”  Paulmann surpassed 65 percent after announcing block trades
in February. An officer at Cencosud’s communications department
didn’t return a phone call seeking comment.  Pension funds have 12 months to comply with the new limits.  Cencosud and rival SACI Falabella retreated 3.6 percent and
5.5 percent, respectively, on March 1 when analysts at Celfin
Capital SA said pension funds may have to sell as much as $1
billion in shares of the companies because of the new rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
