European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said “much remains to be done” to make the
financial system more robust in the wake of the global financial
crisis.  “I believe we are now about halfway through the
comprehensive reforms that the crisis has called for,” Trichet
said in a speech in Frankfurt today.  “We have achieved a blueprint of more stringent  bank
regulations  that includes more loss-absorbing capital, better
risk coverage and limitations for undue leverage. The oversight
of financial institutions as well as markets and market
infrastructure are being strengthened, and the organizational
structure of financial supervision is being overhauled. But much
remains to be done.”  Trichet said the most important aspect is the
implementation of these reforms.  “Moreover, the issue of systemically important financial
institutions requires further reflection, and oversight of the
proper functioning of financial markets in a way that avoids
undue volatility, excessive influence of dominant players and
oligopolistic market structures, while reinforcing transparency,
needs to be addressed resolutely,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
