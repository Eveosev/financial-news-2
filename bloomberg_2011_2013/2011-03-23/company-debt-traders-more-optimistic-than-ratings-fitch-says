Credit-default swaps traders are
more optimistic about the creditworthiness of European companies
than  Fitch Ratings , the company said.  Swaps imply credit rankings that are on average two levels
higher than those assigned by Fitch, analysts led by Alex Griffiths in London wrote in a report. The contracts suggest
most companies should be rated either AA or BB and below, with
very few at the actual rankings of BBB+, they wrote.  “The market appears to make more polarized judgments about
winners and losers,” the analysts wrote.  Investors are “distinctly more positive” on
pharmaceutical and technology companies, where swaps imply
ratings at least five levels higher than those assigned by
Fitch, the analysts wrote. They’re “more circumspect on the
prospects of companies in the euro zone economies,” where
derivatives signal rankings two levels below Fitch.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
