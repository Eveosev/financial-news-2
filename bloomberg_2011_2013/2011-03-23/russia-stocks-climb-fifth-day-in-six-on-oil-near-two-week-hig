Russian stocks reversed losses,
rising for the fifth day in six as oil advanced after a U.S.-led
alliance prepared to attack Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
ground forces.  The Micex Index gained 1.1 percent to 1,759.75 at 1:34 p.m.
in Moscow trading, erasing an earlier loss of as much as 0.5
percent. OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest oil producer,
increased 1.8 percent. OAO Federal Grid Co., the country’s high-
voltage power distributor, added 4.7 percent while OAO Gazprom,
the gas export monopoly, rose 1.2 percent The dollar-denominated
RTS Index rallied 0.9 percent to 1,993.51.  “The Russian stock market is benefiting from a higher oil
market and the ability of investors to outweigh all the risks
concerning  Japan  and Libya,” Ovanes Oganisian, a strategist at
 Renaissance Capital , said by phone today.  Crude oil for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  advanced as much as 41 cents to $105.38 a barrel, the
highest price since March 9, after U.S.-led forces prepared to
attack Qaddafi’s ground forces, raising concern that exports
from the nation will remain disrupted for some time. Libya is
 Africa ’s third-biggest oil producer.  The Stoxx Europe 600 has fallen 6.4 percent from this
year’s highest level on Feb. 17 as Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi
sought to quash a revolt aimed at ending his 41 years in power,
sending oil surging, and Japan battled to stop its Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant from leaking radiation following
the March 11 earthquake. The Micex Index has rallied by 4
percent over the same period.  Three-month-delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
rose as much as 0.9 percent to $9,578.50 a metric ton. All six
LME metals advanced, led by a 1.8 percent increase in zinc. OAO
GMK Norilsk Nickel,  Russia ’s biggest mining company gained 1.2
percent to 7,194 rubles, erasing yesterday’s 1.2 percent loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
