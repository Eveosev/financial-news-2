The cost of protecting U.S.
corporate bonds from default rose as  Portugal ’s pending budget
vote, which may trigger a bailout, put  Europe ’s debt crisis back
in the spotlight.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 0.2 basis point to a
mid-price of 97 basis points as of 5:19 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  “Portugal is on the brink and that still has to fully
register with investors, what that means for this continent,”
said David Nowakowski, strategist at Roubini Global Economics
LLC in  London . “It still has to be dealt with at some point and
that’s going to be pretty soon.”  “We don’t think the risks are fully priced in,” he said.  The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, is up from
79.2 basis points on Feb. 8.  “The whole situation is bad and getting worse,” said
Bonnie Baha, head of the global developed credit group at
DoubleLine Capital LP, which has $9 billion under management.
“Investors have very short memories. I don’t think they
appreciate the interconnectivity between the European banking
system and the rest of the world.”  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
