(Corrects name spelling in first paragraph.)  European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said  interest rates  in the euro
area are currently lower than the inflation rate and that
keeping them at that level would be “very expansionist,”
according to an interview published in Le Monde newspaper.  “We’ll continue to closely follow the situation in Japan
and  Libya ,” Bini Smaghi was quoted as saying. “But we have a
medium-term policy that must take into account the global
recovery and the inflationary pressures that follow from it.”  The ECB’s current position in considering a possible
increase in interest rates is more comparable to that of 2005,
when it began raising rates after a long interval, than 2008,
when it made one rate increase that was subsequently reversed,
he said. Asked what his biggest worry about the global economy
is, Bini Smaghi pointed to inflation in emerging markets,
according to the newspaper.  “The increase in inflation in emerging countries, which
are the engine of world growth” is a source of concern, he was
quoted as saying. “Their growth must not drop because of out-
of-control inflation.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
