A Norwegian bank froze $370 million
in Libyan central bank assets as the Nordic country enforces
sanctions on Muammar Qaddafi’s regime.  “This is a follow-up of the UN Security Council resolution
1970” that called for such measures, Kjetil Elsebutangen, a
spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry , said by phone today,
declining to identify the bank.  The U.S. and its allies are preparing to direct more
attacks against Qaddafi’s ground forces. The Libyan uprising
began in February in the eastern city of Benghazi and is the
bloodiest in a series of revolts that have spread across the
Middle East and ousted the leaders of Egypt and  Tunisia .  Neighboring Sweden has put on hold more than $1.6 billion
in assets connected with the Libyan leader and his regime,
newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported today, citing Jonatan Holst, a
spokesman for the country’s financial supervisory authority.  DnB NOR ASA (DNBNOR) ,  Norway ’s biggest lender, declined to comment
on whether it has frozen Libyan assets. The Oslo-based bank was
complying with government requests to implement sanctions,
Thomas Midteide, a DnB NOR spokesman, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
