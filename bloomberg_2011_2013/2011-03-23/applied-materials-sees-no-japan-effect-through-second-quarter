Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) , the world’s
largest producer of chipmaking equipment, said it expects no
material effect on operations through the current quarter as a
result of the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan .  All of Applied Materials’ sites in the country are back in
operation today, Chief Executive Officer Mike Splinter said at a
meeting with investors and analysts. The company got 6.2 percent
of its revenue from Japan in the first quarter.  Applied Materials fell 19 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $14.92
at 10:27 a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The
shares had gained 7.5 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
