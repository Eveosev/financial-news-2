Purchases of new U.S. homes
unexpectedly declined in February to the slowest pace on record
and prices dropped to the lowest level since December 2003,
adding to evidence the industry is floundering.  Sales decreased 16.9 percent to a 250,000 annual pace,
figures from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a gain to a
290,000 rate, according to the median estimate. The median price
fell 8.9 percent from the same month in 2010.  Builders are struggling to compete with existing homes as
foreclosures add to the overhang of unsold properties and drive
down values. The figures underscore the  Federal Reserve ’s view
that the housing market “continues to be depressed” even as
the rest of the economy improves.  “We’ve got this tug of war going on where we’ve got this
very weak housing sector and a manufacturing sector that’s doing
fine,” said Brian Jones, an economist at  Societe Generale  in
New York, whose 240,000 forecast was the lowest in the Bloomberg
survey. “The new and existing home sales numbers were abysmal.
You could say that part of it was attributable to unusually
harsh weather.”  Previously owned home purchases dropped 9.6 percent in
February, figures from the National Association of Realtors
showed two days ago. The median home price fell to a 9-year-low,
while the supply of unsold properties rose.  Home sales estimates of 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News ranged from 240,000 to 325,000.  Stocks Fall  Stocks rose as higher metal prices lifted shares of
commodity producers. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.3
percent to 1,297.54 at the 4 p.m. close in  New York . The yield
on the benchmark 10-year note was little changed at 3.33
percent.  The Commerce Department revised January purchases up to
301,000 from a previously reported 284,000 rate. Purchases in
February declined to record lows in three of the four U.S.
regions. Sales slumped 57 percent in the Northeast, 28 percent
in the Midwest and 15 percent in the West. The South showed a
6.3 percent decrease.  The median sales price dropped to $202,100 in February from
$221,900 a year earlier, today’s report showed. Last month’s
median price was the lowest since $196,000 in December 2003. The
share of homes sold for $500,000 or more fell in February,
matching January 2009 as the lowest on record.  The supply of homes at the current sales rate rose to 8.9
month’s worth from 7.4 months in January. There were 186,000 new
houses on the market at the end of February, the same as a month
earlier.  More Timely  New-home sales are considered a more timely barometer than
purchases of previously owned homes, which account for about 90
percent of the housing market. Existing-home purchases are
calculated when a contract closes.  Builders are putting off new construction as housing
inventory builds. Housing starts fell in February to a 479,000
annual rate, the lowest level since April 2009, and construction
permits slumped to a record low, Commerce Department figures
showed last week.  The number of homes in foreclosure rose to a record 2.2
million in January, according to Lender Processing Services Inc.
in Jacksonville,  Florida . About 23 percent of homeowners with
mortgages had negative equity in the fourth quarter, meaning
their home-loan balances were higher than the value of their
properties, CoreLogic Inc., a research company in  Santa Ana ,
 California , said in a March 8 report.  Hovnanian Homes  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV) , the largest homebuilder in  New
Jersey , reported on March 1 a first-quarter loss after a drop in
sales and the absence of a tax benefit that boosted results a
year earlier. The loss was $64.1 million, or 82 cents a share,
for the quarter ended Jan. 31, the Red Bank-based company said
in a statement.  “We need confidence to go up,” Chief Executive Officer
 Ara Hovnanian  said March 2 during a call with analysts. “We
need employment numbers to get better, and I think that’ll
attract traffic as well as customers.”  While signs such as stronger manufacturing and exports
indicate the world’s largest economy is gaining momentum, Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his fellow policy makers reaffirmed
plans to buy $600 billion of Treasuries through June to
“promote a stronger recovery” after their second meeting of
the year on March 15.  Bernanke told Congress during a March 2 testimony that
until more people want homes, “there’s no demand for
construction to build houses and so the  construction industry  is
quite reduced.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
