Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)  was the
best performer among companies on Egypt’s benchmark stock index
after shareholders of Russia’s  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  approved issuing
shares for a merger with Wind Telecom SpA.  The shares gained as much as 7.7 percent before closing 2.8
percent lower at 3.52 Egyptian pounds at the 1:30 p.m. in Cairo.
The  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  tumbled 8.9 percent to 5,142.71, the lowest
level since April 2009, as trading resumed for the first time in
almost two-months.  “The VimpelCom deal is definitely behind Orascom Telecom’s
positive performance today,” said Ashraf Akhnoukh, sales trader
at Cairo-based Commercial International Brokerage. “But this
may not last, especially if the market falls another 10 percent
tomorrow.”  Shareholders of VimpelCom voted on March 17 to issue new
shares to complete a merger with Wind Telecom, a $6.5 billion
transaction that would create the world’s sixth-biggest mobile
network operator. The merger still faces opposition from
VimpelCom’s largest shareholder  Telenor ASA. (TEL)   Moody’s Investors Service placed Orascom’s B2 corporate
family rating on review for a possible upgrade on March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
