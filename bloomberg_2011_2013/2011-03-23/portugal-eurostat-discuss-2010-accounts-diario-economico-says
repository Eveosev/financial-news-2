Portugal ’s National Statistics
Institute and Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics office,
are in discussions about the country’s public accounts for 2010,
Diario Economico reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  Eurostat has doubts related to the financial impact of
Banco Portugues de Negocios SA, a bank that the government
seized in 2008, and to the costs of public transport companies,
the Portuguese newspaper said. Portugal’s budget gap for 2010
may exceed 8 percent of gross domestic product if the deficit
calculations have to be changed, Diario said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
