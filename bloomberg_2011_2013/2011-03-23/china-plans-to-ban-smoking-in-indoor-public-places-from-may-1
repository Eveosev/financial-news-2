China , the worldâ€™s biggest
cigarette market, will ban smoking in indoor public places from
May 1 as part of government efforts to reduce tobacco use.  The  Ministry of Health , which announced the ban on its
website yesterday, will also bar installation of cigarette-
vending machines in public places and not allow outdoor smoking
areas to be placed where pedestrians must pass.  Tobacco-related diseases kill a million people a year in
China, home to more than 300 million smokers, according to the
 Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention . Smoking may
lead to 3.5 million deaths in China annually by 2030, according
to a report co-authored by Zhao Ping, deputy director general of
the Cancer Foundation of China.  More than half of Chinese men and 2.4 percent of women in
China smoke, according to data compiled by the Chinese Center
for Disease Control and Prevention. About 70 percent of non-
smoking adults are exposed to second-hand smoke in a week,
according to the agency.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
