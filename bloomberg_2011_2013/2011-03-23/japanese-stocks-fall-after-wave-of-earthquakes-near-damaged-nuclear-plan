Japanese stocks fell for the first
time in three days as engineers struggled to connect power to a
crippled nuclear reactor and  Tokyo  officials advised against
giving tap water to infants after finding traces of radioactive
iodine.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the owner of the damaged plant,
sank 4.5 percent. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest
carmaker, dropped 1.2 percent after saying it will halt domestic
production through March 26. JTekt Corp., a car-parts supplier,
slumped 6.1 percent. Earthquakes early this morning also damped
sentiment, and declines accelerated in the final minutes of
trading following the warning on tap water.  “There are still a lot of uncertainties surrounding the
nuclear fallout, as well as aftershocks, and we won’t be seeing
a stable market for a while,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior
strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion. “No one thinks the nuclear crisis
has ended completely.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.7 percent to 9,449.47
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index lost 0.8 percent
to 861.10, with about eight stocks declining for every seven
that advanced. The Nikkei 225 has lost 7.9 percent since the
close of trading following the March 11 earthquake, the biggest
decline among major equity indexes worldwide.  The gauge surged 7.2 percent in the last two days as power
was restored to some reactors at the crippled Fukushima nuclear
plant in northern Japan, raising hopes the country is making
progress in stabilizing the crisis following a magnitude-9
earthquake and subsequent tsunami on March 11. The Nikkei 225
and the Topix tumbled last week as concern grew about the safety
of damaged reactors.  ‘Taking Profits’  “It’s no surprise to see the market taking profits after
stocks recently bounced back, despite the ongoing worries about
the nuclear crisis,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Toyota retreated 1.2 percent to 3,305 yen. Honda Motor Co.,
Japan’s second-largest carmaker by market value, fell 1.8
percent to 3,090 yen after saying it will suspend production at
three Japanese plants until at least March 27. JTekt slumped 6.1
percent to 976 yen.  Daihatsu Motor Co., Japan’s biggest minicar maker, lost 1.5
percent to 1,214 yen after extending a production halt until
March 24.  Radiation Risk  A radiation level of 500 millisieverts per hour “days
ago” at the No. 2 reactor turbine at the damaged Fukushima Dai-
Ichi nuclear plant forced workers to suspend repairs and they
have yet to restart, Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the
Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told reporters
today. Exposure for 30 minutes at that dosage, the highest
reported so far, would reach the maximum lifetime cumulative
radiation limit permitted by Japan’s health ministry.  The Topix declined 3.4 percent this year to yesterday, more
than double the 1.5 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 2.9 percent in the same
period. Stocks in the Japanese benchmark were valued at 14.6
times estimated earnings on average yesterday, compared with
10.9 times for the Stoxx 600 and 13.3 times for the  S&P 500 .  Economic damage from the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami
on March 11 may last longer than after the Kobe temblor in 1995,
 Bank of Japan  board member Ryuzo Miyao said today. Separately,
Morgan Stanley said in a report dated yesterday that Japan is
likely to fall back into recession.  ‘Negative Sentiment’  Tokyo Electric Power sank 4.5 percent to 1,049 yen. A
series of earthquakes struck this morning near the Fukushima
plant, starting with a magnitude 6.0 temblor at 7:12 a.m. local
time. Quakes of magnitude 4.1, 5.8, 4.9 and 4.3 followed as of
8:03 a.m., according to Japan’s Meteorological Agency.  This morning’s earthquakes are “giving investors a
negative sentiment,” said Tachibana’s Hirano. “Although the
nuclear crisis is moving towards resolution, things are still
unpredictable.”  Beverage makers rose after Tokyo officials warned that city
tap water may unsafe for infants after they found radioactive
iodine levels exceeded safety limits. Kirin Holdings Co., the
supplier of Volvic brand mineral water in  Japan , climbed 1.9
percent to 1,103 yen. Asahi Breweries Ltd., which also supplies
mineral water, increased 2.6 percent to 1,476 yen. Coca-Cola
West Co. jumped 5.6 percent to 1,454 yen.  Kurita Water Industries Ltd., a maker of water-treatment
equipment, rose 2.8 percent to 2,367 yen. Nihon Trim Co., a
maker of water purifiers, surged 14 percent to 1,900 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
