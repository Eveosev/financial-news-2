Hulu LLC, the Web-television
service owned by three of the largest U.S. broadcast networks,
is pursuing options to expand in various foreign markets,
according to Johannes Larcher, the company’s international head.  “We are going strong on several opportunities
internationally,” Larcher said today at the IP&TV conference in
 London . “The biggest challenge is access to content.” The
company wants to expand in markets in Europe, Latin America and
Asia, he said.  Hulu is still seeking local content rights from television
studios before expanding, Larcher said. “Unless we can see a
way to secure that content at reasonable economic terms, then
it’s going to be difficult for us.”  Hulu, owned by  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox, Comcast Corp.’s NBC and
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC, obtains most of its TV programming from
the broadcast divisions of its owners. The networks also offer
shows on their own websites.  The U.S. company, which offers some television shows,
including Viacom Inc.’s “The Daily Show with  Jon Stewart ,” for
free and others through subscription, may not set up the same
model in different markets, Larcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
