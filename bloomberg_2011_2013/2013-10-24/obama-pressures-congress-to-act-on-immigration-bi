President  Barack Obama  said now is
the time for Congress to pass a new immigration law and prove to
voters that Democrats and Republicans can act together.  “This is the moment when we should be able to finally get
the job done,” Obama said at a White House event. “It’s good
for our economy, it’s good for our national security, it’s good
for our people, and we should do it this year.”  After the fiscal standoff with congressional Republicans
was temporarily resolved earlier this month, Obama said he would
make it a priority to push for passage of a new immigration law
before the end of the year.  While the Senate passed an immigration bill on a bipartisan
vote in June, legislation that would provide a path to legal
status for the 11 million undocumented workers in the U.S. still
faces opposition from many Republicans in the  House, where they
have a majority.  Businesses, labor unions and churches are united on
“finishing the job of fixing a broken immigration system,”
Obama said in urging lawmakers to act. “The American people
support this.”  Hispanics gave Obama 71 percent of their votes in the 2012
presidential election. Democrats say Republican opposition to an
immigration bill, along along with the party’s role in the
government shutdown, will be an issue in the 2014 midterm
congressional elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
