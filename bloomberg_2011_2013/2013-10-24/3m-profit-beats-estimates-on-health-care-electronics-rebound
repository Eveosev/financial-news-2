3M Co. (MMM)  posted third-quarter profit
that beat analysts’ estimates on a rebound at its electronics
business and demand for health-care products.  Net income rose 5.9 percent to $1.23 billion, or $1.78 a
share, from $1.16 billion, or $1.65, a year earlier, the  St.
Paul , Minnesota-based company said today in a statement. The
average of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $1.75.  Sales at 3M’s electronics and energy business rose 2.5
percent, after posting declines in the last two quarters amid
what the company called “soft” demand. 3M, led by Chief
Executive Officer Inge Thulin, cited growth in Asia,  Latin
America  and Europe.  “It was an excellent quarter for 3M on many fronts and our
businesses continue to grow profitably,” Thulin said on a
conference call today with analysts.  3M  gained  1.3 percent to $124.85 at 9:39 a.m. in New York.
The shares had gained 33 percent this year through yesterday.  The electronics and energy unit’s sales increase to $1.45
billion followed declines of 3.2 percent in the second quarter
and 3.3 percent in the first quarter.  3M is considered a bellwether for the global economy
because it has businesses ranging from  consumer goods  to health
care to auto parts and last year got 65 percent of its  revenue 
outside of the U.S.  Annual Forecast  Organic sales, which strip out impacts from acquisitions
and foreign exchange, rose 4.3 percent in  Europe ,  Middle East 
and Africa and advanced 6.8 in Asia Pacific. Latin America
posted with organic sales growth of 11 percent.  3M narrowed its 2013 earnings forecast to $6.65 to $6.75 a
share, from a previous range of $6.60 to $6.85. Analysts
projected $6.70, the average of 16  estimates .  Sales in the quarter rose 5.6 percent to $7.9 billion,
beating the average estimate of $7.85 billion. The gain was led
by revenue increases of 5.5 percent to $1.33 billion at the
health-care unit and 8.6 percent to $2.67 billion at the
industrial unit, which was helped by the $860 million
 acquisition  of Ceradyne Inc. in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
