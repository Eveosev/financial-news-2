Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell for a third day amid concern that China will curb
property prices, reducing demand for the building material.  Rebar for delivery in May, the most-actively traded
contract by volume on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, dropped as
much as 0.9 percent to 3,601  yuan  ($592) a metric ton and was at
3,617 yuan at 10:15 a.m. local time.  Home prices  in China’s four major cities last month jumped
the most since January 2011, heightening concerns that a bubble
is forming. Policy makers may release new property curbs in the
fourth quarter, the state-owned China Securities Journal
reported yesterday.  “Concerns grew that China is eying a crackdown on
property-related lending that will harm sentiment toward copper
and steel,” said  Helen Lau , an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Ltd. in
Hong Kong.  The  spot price  of rebar was little changed at 3,491 a ton
on Oct. 22, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  Iron ore for May delivery, the most-active contract by
volume on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, fell 0.6 percent to 933
yuan a ton. The commodity for immediate delivery at Tianjin port
was little changed at $133.20 yesterday, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
