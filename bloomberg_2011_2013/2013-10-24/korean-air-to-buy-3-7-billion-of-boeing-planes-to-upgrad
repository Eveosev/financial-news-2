Korean Air Lines Co. (003490) , the country’s
biggest carrier, agreed to buy $3.7 billion of aircraft from
 Boeing Co. (BA)  to modernize its fleet amid growing travel demand.  The carrier is buying five 747-8 Intercontinentals, five
777-300ERs and one 787 Dreamliner, the Seoul-based airline said
in a regulatory filing. Korean Air’s board today approved the
purchase, for which initial agreements were announced earlier.  The orders for the new stretched version of the 747 jet,
known for its iconic fuselage hump, will help the carrier retire
15 older 747-400 jumbos from its fleet by 2017. Korean Air,
which competes with Asiana Airlines Inc., is part of a growing
number of Asian carriers buying new planes from Boeing and
Airbus SAS as economic growth in the region lifts business and
leisure travel demand.  Korean Air will hold orders for 10 passenger versions of
the stretched 747 jet with the latest deal. It has received
three of the seven jumbo freighters it ordered.  The company expects to start taking delivery of the new
planes starting in 2016, it said in June, when it reached an
initial agreement with Boeing on the order. The company operates
35 747-400 jets and three of the new freighters, according to
its website.  The airline posted third-quarter  net income  of 338.5
billion won ($319 million), boosted by foreign exchange
translation gains, Korean Air said in a regulatory statement
today. That was little changed from a year earlier. Sales
dropped 3 percent 3.18 trillion won. Korean Air  shares  climbed 5
percent, the most since Oct. 18, to 38,750 won in  Seoul .  On international services, the airline filled 80.6 percent
of its passenger seats in the third quarter, compared with 82
percent a year earlier. Yields dropped 2 percent to 9.8 cents.  Cargo demand dropped 6.2 percent in the July-September
period, Korean Air said. It filled 76.6 percent of its space on
planes, compared with 75.8 percent a year earlier. Yields fell
2.1 percent to 28.2 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
