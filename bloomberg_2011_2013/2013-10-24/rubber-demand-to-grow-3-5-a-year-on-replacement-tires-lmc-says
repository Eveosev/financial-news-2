Global rubber consumption will grow
at an average of 3.5 percent a year through 2018 as demand
increases for replacement tires, supporting prices of the
commodity, according to LMC International Ltd.  “Looking forward to 2018, we’re expecting a pickup in tire
demand,” Gerard Stapleton, head of Southeast Asian research for
LMC, said in an interview in  Kuala Lumpur  yesterday. “That’s
going to support the rubber market.”  Natural rubber traded in  Tokyo  entered a  bull market  in
August as economic growth in  China , which consumes about a third
of the world’s production, accelerated for the first time in
three quarters in the July-September period. Car  sales  in the
country jumped 21 percent in September to an eight-month high,
contributing to what LMC Automotive Ltd. says would be record
global purchases in 2013.  Emerging markets “are going to form the basis for future
replacement tire demand,” Stapleton said at a conference before
the interview. By 2020, China will account for 35 percent of
global output of light vehicle tires from 23 percent in 2010 and
52 percent of medium or heavy commercial vehicle tires from 43
percent, his presentation showed.  Rubber futures closed at 262.7 yen a kilogram ($2,699 a
metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange today, advancing 17
percent from a nine-month low in June to trim this year’s
retreat to 13 percent. Prices, which slumped as much as 62
percent since peaking in 2011, will climb to 300 yen by Dec. 31,
according to a Bloomberg survey published Oct 8.  China Growth  While  China’s economy  grew 7.8 percent in the third
quarter, the  International Monetary Fund  on Oct. 8 cut its
outlook for this year and next. The fund cut the forecast for
China to 7.6 percent this year from 7.8 percent in July and to
7.3 percent in 2014 from 7.7 percent. Growth worldwide will be
2.9 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, the IMF said in
a report, compared with July predictions of 3.1 percent for 2013
and 3.8 percent for 2014.  The lower IMF forecasts will lead to a revision of the
International Rubber Study Group’s projections for growth in
rubber and tire demand this year, which currently stand at 3
percent and 5.3 percent respectively, according to its senior
economist Lekshmi Nair.  “The tire replacement market and the sales market in
 Europe  and the U.S. is not coming up the way we expected at the
beginning of this year, so that will have an impact on our
consumption forecast,” Nair said in an interview yesterday.  Global Production  The new forecasts may be released in the first week of
December, Nair said. Global rubber  output  will climb 4.5 percent
in 2014 from an estimated 11.7 million tons this year as
plantings between 2006 and 2008 come into tapping, she said.  Tires represent 70 percent of natural-rubber consumption in
China, the Qingdao International Rubber Exchange Market
estimates. Wholesale deliveries of cars, multipurpose and sport-utility vehicles climbed to 1.59 million units last month, the
most since the 1.73 million sold in January, the state-backed
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said Oct. 11.  Global automobile  sales  will rise 2.9 percent to an all-time high of 83.5 million units this year and another 5.4
percent to 88 million in 2014, according to Ammar Master, a
senior market analyst at the Thai unit of Oxford, England-based
LMC Automotive.  “Future growth is expected to be dominated by the  emerging
markets , driven by domestic and export demand,” said Stapleton,
referring to production of light vehicles and tires.  Thailand ,  Indonesia  and  Malaysia  are the world’s biggest
natural rubber producers, representing about 70 percent of
supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
