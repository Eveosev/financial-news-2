Two Army National Guard members
sustained injuries that arenâ€™t life-threatening today at a
 Tennessee  installation when a third guardsman shot them,
according to a U.S. Navy spokesmen.  The two people were shot in the foot and leg before the
gunman was captured, according to Rear Admiral John Kirby, a
Navy spokesman.  The Navy took a suspect into custody, the
service said in a Twitter Inc. posting.  The National Guard facility is located on Navy property
near the naval base in Millington, Tennessee, Kirby said.  The base near  Memphis  was temporarily locked down and was
to be reopened soon, said Kirby, who had no additional
information about the shooting and referred reporters to the
Army for more information.  The incident took place five weeks after a Sept. 16
shooting rampage at the Naval Yard in  Washington  that left 12
people dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
