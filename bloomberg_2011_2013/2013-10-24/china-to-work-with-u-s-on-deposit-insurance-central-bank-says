China ’s central bank and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. signed an  agreement  to work together as
the world’s second-largest economy prepares to introduce a
system of protection for savers.  The memorandum of understanding seeks to strengthen
communication and policy coordination on  depositor  protection
and regulation of cross-border financial institutions, according
to a statement posted on the  People’s Bank of China ’swebsite
today. The pact updates an agreement signed in 2007, the FDIC
said in a separate statement.  China is accelerating the establishment of a deposit
insurer as the government seeks to deregulate  interest rates  and
reduce the state’s role in the economy. Insurance may be the
next step in the liberalization process, four out of 12
economists said in a survey by  Bloomberg News  last month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
