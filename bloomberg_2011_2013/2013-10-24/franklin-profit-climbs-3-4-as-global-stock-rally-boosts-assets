Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , the manager
of the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds that has the majority
of its equity assets in global stocks, said fiscal fourth-quarter profit climbed 3.4 percent as rising markets boosted
assets.  Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 increased to
$509 million, or 80 cents per share, from $492.1 million, or 77
cents, a year earlier, the San Mateo, California-based company
said today in a statement. Franklin missed the 87-cent average
 estimate  of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Franklin benefited from a rally in worldwide equities,
driven by improving economies in China and Europe and the
continuation of low-interest rate policies from central banks.
 Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, said this
week that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to lift its target
rate for overnight loans between banks until 2016 because of
weak payroll growth.  “Franklin has the scale, diversification and global
footprint to take advantage of this environment,”  Michael Kim ,
an analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York, said
in telephone interview before earnings were released.  Franklin’s shares, which closed yesterday at $54.29, gained
30 percent this year, compared with an increase of 34 percent
for the 20-member Standard & Poor’s index of asset managers and
custody banks.  The MSCI All Country World Index returned 18 percent in the
year ended Sept. 30 and 8.1 percent in the quarter, including
reinvested dividends.  Hasenstab’s Fund  Franklin had 40 percent of its $844.7 billion in assets in
stocks, the bulk of it in global and international equities,
company data show. Bonds represented 43 percent of assets, and
hybrid funds with stocks and fixed income accounted for 16
percent.  The $69.4 billion  Templeton Global Bond Fund (TPINX)  suffered net
redemptions of $1.2 billion in the quarter amid a flight from
fixed income, estimates from Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) 
show. The fund managed by  Michael Hasenstab , has attracted $3.8
billion in 2013, according to Morningstar. Templeton Global Bond
beat 76 percent of peers this year through Oct. 21.  Franklin’s largest fund, the $80.6 billion  Franklin Income
Fund (FKINX) , won $1.7 billion in the quarter and $4.9 billion this
calendar year, according to Morningstar. The fund, which buys
stocks and bonds, outperformed 65 percent of rivals in 2013.  The company in June named Chief Executive Officer Greg Johnson chairman of the board after his father,  Charles Johnson ,
 retired . Yale University last month said it received a pledge of
$250 million, the largest gift in its 312-year history, from
Charles Johnson to build two new colleges.  Franklin split its stock 3-for-1 in July, altering the
earnings per share originally reported in 2012. Companies
typically split their stock when they determine the share price
has become too high for individual investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
