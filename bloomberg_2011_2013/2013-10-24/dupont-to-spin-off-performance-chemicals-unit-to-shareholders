DuPont Co. (DD) , the biggest U.S.
chemical maker by market value, plans to spin off its
performance-chemicals unit as part of efforts by the company to
boost  shareholder value  and focus on higher-margin businesses.  The tax-free spinoff will be completed in about 18 months,
after which DuPont investors will hold all of the new company,
Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont said today in a statement. The
company anticipates costs from the transaction will be 1 cent to
2 cents a share in the fourth quarter.  DuPont first said in July it might spin off the unit
because of slow-growing, volatile earnings. The business is the
world’s biggest producer of titanium dioxide, a white pigment
used in paint. It also produces cyanide, Freon refrigerants and
Teflon coating for nonstick pans.  DuPont Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Ellen Kullman 
has been under pressure to improve the company’s performance
from Trian Fund Management LP. The New York-based hedge fund,
co-founded by activist  Nelson Peltz , increased its stake to more
than 21 million shares, or about 2.3 percent, and met top DuPont
executives to discuss ways to boost shareholder value, people
familiar with the matter said in August.  DuPont’s announcement was made after regular trading ended
in  New York , where the shares rose 3.5 percent to $63.51 at 4:40
p.m.  The shares  climbed 36 percent this year through the close
of trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
