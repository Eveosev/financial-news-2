Mexican peso volatility rose to a
one-week high as analysts forecast that the central bank will
lower borrowing costs for a third time this year to shore up
growth in Latin America’s second-biggest economy.  Three-month historical volatility, a measure of the
magnitude of the peso’s fluctuations during the period,
increased to 12.22 percent at 12:06 p.m. in Mexico City, the
highest level on a closing basis since Oct. 15, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency appreciated 0.2 percent
to 12.9686 per dollar.  “There’s pressure obviously related to the central bank’s
monetary-policy decision tomorrow,” Agustin Villarreal, fixed-income and foreign-exchange director at Grupo Financiero Invex
SA in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. “There’s a
lot of volatility.”  The central bank will lower the target lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to a record low 3.5 percent tomorrow
after cutting it by the same amount last month and 0.5
percentage point in March, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The national statistics agency
reported economic activity climbed 0.84 percent in August from a
year earlier, slower than the 1 percent median forecast.  While Mexican  consumer prices  increased 0.4 percent in the
first half of October, more than economists projected, annual
inflation slowed to 3.27 percent, approaching the central bank’s
3 percent target.  Yields on inflation-linked bonds maturing in December 2014
were little changed at minus 0.57 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
