CSKA Moscow  faces disciplinary
action by European soccer’s governing body over racist chants
from its fans toward Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure.  UEFA said in a statement that it has opened proceedings
against the club because of “racist behavior” and the
“setting off of fireworks” during yesterday’s  Champions League 
match in the Russian capital.  Toure, an Ivory Coast international, said such incidents
warrant a tougher stance by UEFA.  “They have to ban them at some stage,” Toure said after
City’s 2-1 win. “For a couple of years. I don’t know.”  Earlier this month Italy’s Lazio was fined 40,000 euros
($55,000) and ordered to play in a partially-empty stadium for
one match after racist chanting by its supporters.  Croatia ’s
Rijeka and Dinamo Zagreb, Cyprus’s APOEL, and Poland’s Legia
Warsaw have also received UEFA penalties after racism by fans.  UEFA said it will deal with the CSKA matter on Oct. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
