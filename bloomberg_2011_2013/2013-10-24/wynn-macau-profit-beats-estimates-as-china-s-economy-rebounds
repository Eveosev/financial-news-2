Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , the casino operator
controlled by billionaire  Steve Wynn , posted a 13 percent
increase in third-quarter earnings as an improving Chinese
economy boosted spending.  Adjusted property earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose to $329.1 million
from $292.2 million a year earlier, according to a statement by
parent company  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  yesterday. That surpassed the
$300.6 million average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net revenue climbed 9.6 percent to $997.6 million.  China’s economic growth accelerated for the first time in
three quarters with gross domestic product rising 7.8 percent in
the July-September period from a year earlier.  Wynn Macau will generate a compounded annual growth rate in
Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, of 10 percent in the next three years, the
smallest rate among all Macau casino operators,  Philip Tulk , a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Standard Chartered Bank, said in a
research note dated Oct. 15.  The company is expected to reap only “modest benefits of
refurbishments at the older hotel and a new VIP area, as it
remains focused on slower-growth, lower-margin VIP gaming,”
Tulk said, referring to the high-stake gaming sector. Bigger
rivals including  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  and  Galaxy Entertainment Group
Ltd. (27)  have been expanding in the mass-market segment that
provides faster growth and higher margins.  The shares climbed 1.7 percent to close at HK$30.25 in Hong
Kong yesterday. Wynn Macau has risen 44 percent this year,
outperforming the 0.8 percent gain in benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Bond Issue  Wynn Macau this month raised $600 million by selling senior
notes which will be due 2021. The company plans to use the net
proceeds from the offering for work capital and general
corporate purposes, it said in a  statement .  The operator is constructing the $4 billion Wynn Palace
casino resort on the Chinese city’s Cotai Strip, the Asian
equivalent of the  Las Vegas Strip . The resort will feature
floral sculptures the size of “floats of the Rose Bowl
Parade,” Wynn earlier said. It is scheduled to open in early
2016.  Gambling revenue in Macau, the only place in China where
casinos are legal, gained 17 percent to 260.6 billion patacas
($33 billion) in the first nine months of this year, after
raking in $38 billion in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
