Kone Oyj (KNEBV) , the elevator supplier to
 London ’s Shard skyscraper, lost a final appeal at the European
Union’s highest court to overturn a 142.1 million-euro ($195.9
million) fine levied for colluding with rivals on prices for
elevators and escalators.  The EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg today rejected the
appeal and upheld the fine. The decision is final.  The European Commission in 2007  fined  five companies 992.3
million euros for fixing prices in  Belgium ,  Germany , Luxembourg
and the Netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004. They rigged
contract bids, allocated projects to each other and shared
confidential information, the EU said.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  in 2011 won a court decision that cut a
479.7 million-euro fine, the biggest in the cartel. Schindler
lost a final court bid in July to cut or quash its 143.7
million-euro penalty.  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Otis unit  last
year lost  a final bid to have its 224.9 million-euro fine
overturned.  The case is:  C-510/11 P , Kone and Others v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
