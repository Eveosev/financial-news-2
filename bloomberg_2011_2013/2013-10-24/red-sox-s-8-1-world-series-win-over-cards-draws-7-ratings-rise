The Boston Red Sox’s 8-1 win over
the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 1 of the  World Series  drew 7
percent higher television ratings for Fox Sports than last
year’s opener between the Detroit Tigers and San Francisco
Giants, according to the network.  Last night’s game was seen in 9.4 percent of households in
the top 56 U.S. television markets, the News Corp. network said
in an e-mailed statement. The rating last year was 8.8 when the
Giants beat the Tigers 8-3 to open the Major League Baseball
championship series, which also began on a Wednesday.  Mike Napoli  hit a three-run double in the first inning and
 Jon Lester  pitched 7 2/3 scoreless innings last night at Fenway
Park in Boston as the Red Sox moved a game closer to their first
World Series title since 2007. The Cardinals are seeking their
second championship in three years.  Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is tonight in Boston,
with  John Lackey  pitching for the Red Sox against Michael Wacha
for St. Louis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
