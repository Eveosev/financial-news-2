A London judge rejected a bid by
 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  to delay London court
proceedings in a dispute with  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  over a
derivatives deal.  The agreements that governed the deals included a pact to
hear any disputes in  England , according to the decision today
from U.K. High Court Judge Henry Eder, who blocked Monte
Paschi’s application to postpone the proceedings until the case
could be heard in  Italy .  “The court should, so far as possible, give effect to the
parties’ bargain and be very slow indeed to exercise a
discretion in a manner the effect of which would be to destroy
such bargain,” Judge Eder said today. “The mandate agreement
provides that the English courts are the most appropriate.”  Nomura filed a claim in London against Monte Paschi on
March 1 on the same day the Italian bank, the world’s oldest,
brought separate suits in Florence seeking damages over two
derivative contracts dubbed Alexandria and Santorini, arranged
respectively by Nomura and Deutsche Bank AG. Nomura is seeking a
declaration from the British court that its derivatives
contracts with Monte Paschi are valid.  The Italian lender is seeking 700 million euros ($966
million) in damages from Nomura and Paschi’s former managers,
and 500 million euros from Deutsche Bank and former managers.  A spokeswoman for Monte Paschi didn’t have an immediate
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
