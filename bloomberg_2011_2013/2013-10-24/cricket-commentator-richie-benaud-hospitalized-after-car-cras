Richie Benaud, one of the best-known
voices in cricket broadcasting, is recovering in the hospital
after being injured in a car accident in Sydney.  Benaud, 83, mounted a verge and hit a small brick wall
while driving alone yesterday morning, his employer  Channel Nine 
said in a statement today. He’s in a stable condition after
suffering chest and shoulder injuries and is expected to be
hospitalized for “a number of days,” the broadcaster added.  “No one else was injured, and I was more worried about the
car than myself,” Benaud, a former  Australia  cricket captain,
said in the statement.  Benaud has been involved in broadcasting for about 50 years
after ending his playing career. His authoritative, chatty style
and enthusiasm made him popular in England, where he worked for
the British Broadcasting Corp. and Channel Four, and Australia
with Channel Nine.  Benaud, who played 63 Tests for Australia and became the
first cricketer from his country to score 2,000 runs and take
200 wickets in elite matches, was scheduled to call the Ashes
series against  England  starting Nov. 21 in Brisbane.  He’ll return to the commentary box “when he is good and
ready,” Nine Entertainment Chief Executive Officer David
Gyngell said in the statement.  “Richie is a national treasure,” Gyngell said. “In the
Nine family, he sits at the head of the table.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
