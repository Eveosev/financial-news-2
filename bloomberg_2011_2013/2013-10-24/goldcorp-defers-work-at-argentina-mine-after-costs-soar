Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s largest
gold miner by market value, deferred work at its Cerro Negro
project in  Argentina  after the estimated construction cost
jumped on permitting delays and higher labor expenses.  Cerro Negro will cost $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion,
Goldcorp said in its third-quarter earnings statement today.
That compares with a January estimate of $1.35 billion. The
Vancouver-based company said it’s suspending exploration and
development of the Mariana Norte vein at the site. Gold
production is now expected to start in mid-2014.  “While we anticipated a slow ramp-up/delay at Cerro Negro,
the deferral of Mariana Norte combined with the six-month delay
is worse than we expected,”  Greg Barnes , a Toronto-based
analyst at TD Securities Inc., said in a note. Initial output
was previously expected in the first quarter of next year, he
said.  Gold producers are trying to cut spending and curb rising
mining costs after the metal slipped into a  bear market  in
April. Cerro Negro has been affected by inflation in Argentina
at an annualized rate of about 25 percent to 30 percent and no
corresponding drop in the peso  exchange rate , Goldcorp said.  Goldcorp  rose  4.5 percent to C$27.76 at the close in
Toronto after the gold price climbed as much as 1.4 percent in
 New York  and the company reported better-than-expected earnings.  Topping Estimates  Third-quarter profit excluding one-time items was 23 cents
a share, exceeding the 20-cent average of 19 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income fell to $5 million, or break even per share,
from $498 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Sales declined
to $929 million from $1.28 billion, missing the $1.07 billion
average estimate.  The company’s average cost to produce and sell gold, after
profiting from sales of silver and other metals, was $551 an
ounce, compared with $220 an ounce in the third quarter of 2012
and the $554 average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  All-in sustaining costs, a more comprehensive metric
adopted this year by most producers, rose to $992 an ounce from
$801.  Gold production rose to 637,100 ounces from 592,500 ounces
a year earlier. The average of eight estimates was for 683,100
ounces.  Goldcorp expects 2013 output will be 2.6 million to 2.7
million ounces, at all-in sustaining costs of $1,050 to $1,100
per ounce. Its previous forecasts were for 2.55 million to 2.8
million ounces and costs of $1,000 to $1,100 per ounce.  Gold averaged $1,328 on the Comex in New York in the third
quarter, 20 percent less than a year earlier and 6.3 percent
lower than the second quarter.  Toronto-based  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  is the world’s biggest
gold producer by sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
