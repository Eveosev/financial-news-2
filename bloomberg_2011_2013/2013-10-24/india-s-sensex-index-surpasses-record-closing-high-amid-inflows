India ’s benchmark index fell after
briefly surpassing its record closing high as traders pared
positions before derivatives contracts expire.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  led a gauge of technology shares to its lowest
level in two weeks.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s top producer of
the fuel, declined to a six-week low.  Bank of Baroda  rose to a
three-month high after the government said the bank is among 20
state-run lenders that will receive 140 billion rupees ($2.3
billion) to guard against bad debts.  The Sensex dropped 0.2 percent to 20,725.43 at the close.
The gauge climbed to 21,039.42 intraday, exceeding the all-time
closing high of 21,004.96 on Nov. 5, 2010. Overseas investors
bought a net $15.2 billion of local shares this year, the most
among the 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg after  Japan . The
Sensex has increased 6.7 percent since Jan. 1 and is the second-most  expensive  benchmark stock measure among the four-largest
emerging markets, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Valuations are looking a bit stretched now,” Vaibhav Sanghavi, a director with Ambit Investment Advisors in Mumbai,
said by phone. “Markets will stay volatile ahead of the monthly
derivatives expiry and the monetary policy review.”  The rally has surprised India’s equity strategists, who
abandoned predictions for a record high in the Sensex on
concerns earnings growth will slow. The average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 11 forecasters fell to 19,409 this month
from 21,150 in July.  The Sensex has climbed 16 percent from this year’s low on
Aug. 21 as the Fed’s unexpected decision last month to maintain
stimulus spurred flows to  emerging markets . Overseas investors
bought a net $105 million of local shares on Oct. 23, the 14th
day of purchases, data from the market regulator show.  Rajan Boost  The rupee’s 12 percent rally from a record low in August
also gave  Reserve Bank of India  Governor Raghuram Rajan scope to
roll back emergency increases in borrowing costs aimed at
supporting the currency. While growth in  Asia ’s third-largest
economy slowed to 4.4 percent in the June quarter, the weakest
pace since 2009, Rajan said this month that the expansion is
poised to accelerate. The RBI will review rates on Oct. 29.  Net incomes at all nine of the 30 companies in the Sensex
that have announced  results  so far this season have beaten or
matched estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. About 47
percent of the companies trailed forecasts in the June quarter  “Earnings in the next quarter will be much better as we
will see the impact of the measures taken by the government and
the RBI,” Chokkalingam G., chief investment officer at Centrum
Wealth Management Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai.  Wipro tumbled 4.4 percent to 470.85 rupees, boosting the
two-day decline to 8.5 percent, the most since April 22. Coal
India lost 3.6 percent to 279.3 rupees, the lowest level since
Sept. 6.  Bank of Baroda (BOB)  rose 1.2 percent to 597.40 rupees while
 HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB)  added 1.4 percent to 669.3 rupees.  The 50-stock CNX Nifty Index fell 0.2 percent to 6,164.35.
Rollovers in Nifty futures for October delivery were at 29
percent today, compared with 23 percent average of the previous
two series, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Derivative contracts in India expire on the last Thursday
of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
