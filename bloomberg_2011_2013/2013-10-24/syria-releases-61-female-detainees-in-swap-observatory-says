Syria  has freed 61 female prisoners,
part of a swap that involved the release of nine Shiite Lebanese
men abducted by Syrian rebels and two Turkish pilots snatched in
Lebanon, the Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights  said today.  At least 67 more prisoners are expected to be released as
part of the deal, Rami Abdurrahman, head of U.K.-based activist
group, said an interview from Coventry,  England .  The women’s release came after the nine Lebanese men were
freed by their Syrian rebel captors on Oct. 19 after mediation
by Qatar. The rebels said in August they would only free the men
if the government of President Bashar al-Assad released 127
female prisoners.  A Lebanese Shiite group in Beirut abducted the two  Turkish
Airlines (THYAO)  pilots, whose country has supported the rebels, on Aug.
9 as bargaining chips to try to secure the release of the nine
men.  In another development, Tal Al-Mallohi, a 22-year-old
activist and blogger, is expected to be freed today, Abdurrahman
said. He said her release is not part of the prisoner swap.  Al-Mallohi has been held by Syria’s security services since
December 2009, before the Syrian conflict began in March 2011,
according to  Human Rights Watch .  To contact the reporter on this story:
