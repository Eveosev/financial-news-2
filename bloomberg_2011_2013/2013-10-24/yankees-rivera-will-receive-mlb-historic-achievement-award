New York  Yankees relief pitcher
Mariano Rivera will receive the Major League Baseball
commissioner’s Historic Achievement Award tonight before Game 2
of the World Series.  Rivera, 43, retired at the end of the regular season as the
holder of baseball’s record with 652 career saves and helped
lead the Yankees to five World Series championships. His earned
run average of 2.21 is the best by any pitcher with more than
1,000 innings pitched in the modern era that began in 1920.  Rivera was limited to nine appearances, and five saves,
during the 2012 season before he tore a ligament in his right
knee in early May. He returned for the 2013 season and appeared
in 64 games to add 44 saves to his record.  Commissioner Bud Selig will present the award at Fenway
Park before the World Series game between the Boston Red Sox and
St. Louis Cardinals. The Red Sox won 8-1 last night.  Ken Griffey Jr. was the last recipient of the award in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
