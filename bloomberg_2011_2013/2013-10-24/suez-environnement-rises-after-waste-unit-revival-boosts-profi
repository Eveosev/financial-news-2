Suez Environnement (SEV)  rose to a more
than two-year high in Paris after the second-biggest European
water company said its waste-handling business is recovering.  The company gained as much as 3.6 percent to 13.085 euros,
the highest intraday price since Aug. 1, 2011. French, U.K. and
Scandinavian conditions improved, the Paris-based utility said.  “In a still-difficult macroeconomic context, the third
quarter seems to show some early signs of stabilization,” Chief
Financial Officer Jean-Marc Boursier told a conference call.  Suez reported nine-month earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization climbed 5 percent to 1.86 billion
euros ($2.6 billion). Sales fell 3 percent to 10.8 billion euros
and volumes of industrial waste handled slid less in the three
months ended Sept. 30 compared with the previous two quarters.  The company rose 1.4 percent to 12.81 euros by 12:36 p.m.
in Paris trading, bringing its gain for the year to 41 percent.  Suez Environnement and the bigger  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) 
have seen waste-treatment volumes drop as economic weakness in
 Europe  hurts factory output. They compete to provide municipal
and industrial waste and water services as well as for large
treatment installations like desalination plants.  “We are continuing to close sites in Europe as a way of
restructuring our waste division,” Boursier said. At the end of
September, the utility had shut 42 sites compared with 29 at the
end of the first half, in  France ,  Germany  and the Netherlands.  Maintain Forecast  While Suez will maintain a forecast for waste volumes to
drop 3 percent this year, they will stabilize in 2014, he said.  Local conditions haven’t yet improved in the Netherlands.  Like-for-like waste revenue rose 0.3 percent in the third
quarter compared with a drop of 4.5 percent in the first half.
Waste volumes slid 3.5 percent in the three months compared with
4.3 percent in the first quarter and 3.8 percent in the second.  Suez retained financial targets including cutting costs in
2013 by 180 million euros and paying a dividend equal to or more
than 2012’s 65 euro cents a share. It said last week that a
dispute over building delays at a Melbourne, Australia, seawater
treatment plant was resolved and 58 million euros in provisions
set aside last year would be reversed in the fourth quarter.  “We believe that consensus Ebitda expectations for the
full year should be increased,” Emmanuel Retif, an analyst at
 Raymond James , said today in a note. He maintained an outperform
rating on the company’s shares.  The utility, 36 percent held by  GDF Suez SA (GSZ) , has forecast
2013 Ebitda of at least 2.55 billion euros and debt-to-Ebitda of
about 3 times for 2013. Suez sees free cash flow of at least 1
billion euros. Net financial debt was 7.82 billion euros at the
end of September, compared with 7.83 billion euros in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
