Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  is
poised for a short-term slump as it closed yesterday below the
previous day’s open after opening above its close, according to
AllianceBernstein LP.  The gauge formed a so-called bearish engulfing pattern,
repeating trends seen after recent highs on May 22 and July 18,
according to Ayush Nagaraj, a Hong Kong-based sales trader at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., a division of New York-based
AllianceBernstein. The measure slumped 20 percent from the May
peak through June 13, and slipped 7.7 percent from July 18
through the end of that month.  “Sellers have wrestled power away from buyers,” said
Nagaraj. “It’s probably prudent to take profits or sell now.”  The Nikkei 225 closed 2 percent lower at 14,426.05
yesterday, after opening up 0.5 percent. The gauge advanced 0.1
percent at the close on Oct. 22, after falling 0.1 percent at
the open. The measure dropped yesterday after approaching an
upper resistance level of 14,800 and may decline to 14,000 to
test its 100-day  moving average , according to Nagaraj.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
