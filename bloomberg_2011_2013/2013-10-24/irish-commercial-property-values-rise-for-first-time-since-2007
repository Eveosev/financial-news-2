Irish commercial real estate values
rose for the first time in six years in the third quarter on
increasing demand for Dublin offices, Investment Property
Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses climbed
0.3 percent in the three months through September, IPD said in a
statement today. Total return, which combines changes in real
estate values and rental income, was 2.6 percent, the highest
since September 2007.  “Growth is creeping back to Ireland’s property market
after six very difficult years,” Phil Tily, an  executive
director  at London-based IPD, said in the statement. “The
rewards of lowering stamp duty, the ridding of rent review
legislation, maintaining corporation tax levels and successfully
implementing austerity measures are now starting to pay off.”  Ireland’s property and construction industries are
rebounding after the nation suffered the worst property crash in
western  Europe . The Irish economy went into recession during the
global financial crisis as  house prices  plunged and unemployment
soared.  IPD said its data mask a “far from standard recovery” as
values of retail and industrial properties continue to drop,
though at a slower rate. Demand for offices in Dublin from
tenants and investors is driving returns, IPD said.  Ireland’s building industry expanded last month for the
first time since the 2007 crash,  Ulster Bank  said on Oct. 14.
The bank’s purchasing managers index for construction rose to
55.7 in September from 49.7 in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
