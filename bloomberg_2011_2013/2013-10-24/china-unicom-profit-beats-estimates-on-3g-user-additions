China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) , the
nation’s second-largest mobile-phone company, posted third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as data sales to
new subscribers rose.  Net income gained 51 percent to 3.06 billion  yuan  ($503
million), from 2.02 billion yuan a year earlier, based on
figures derived from nine-month earnings the Beijing-based
company reported yesterday. That compares with the 2.96 billion-yuan average of five  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chairman Chang Xiaobing added almost 12 million users to
the company’s third-generation wireless network during the
period. Luring subscribers that pay more to download games and
videos on their phones helped the company outperform larger
 China Mobile Ltd. (941) , which earlier this week said profit fell 8.8
percent in the period, missing analysts’ estimates.  “Rapid 3G subscriber growth adds higher average-revenue-per-user customers to its low-end 2G user base,” Bertram Lai, a
Hong Kong-based analyst with CIMB Securities Ltd. wrote in an
Oct. 21 report.  Revenue rose 19 percent to 75.9 billion yuan in the third
quarter, beating the 75.3 billion yuan average of three analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Unicom rose 1.7 percent to close at HK$12.22 in  Hong Kong 
trading before the announcement. The  shares  have dropped 1.6
percent this year, compared with a 0.8 percent gain for the
city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Unicom had 111.6 million 3G subscribers at the end of the
third quarter, compared with 169.5 million for market leader
China Mobile, according to data the companies released this
month. The smaller operator had a mobile customer base of 272.8
million, or 36 percent of China Mobile’s 755.2 million.  China Mobile, the world’s largest phone company by
subscribers, on Oct. 21 posted the biggest  profit  decline in 14
years as costs to build its new network rose and users switched
to third-party messaging apps. Net income fell to 28.4 billion
yuan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
