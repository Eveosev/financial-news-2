Sandvik AB (SAND) , the world’s biggest
maker of metal-cutting tools, posted third-quarter operating
profit that missed analysts’ estimates as weak metals prices and
a strong krona weighed on demand from mining clients.  Operating profit fell to 2.5 billion kronor ($393 million)
from 3.3 billion kronor a year earlier, the  Stockholm , Sweden-based company said in a statement today. Analysts on average
predicted operating profit of 2.86 billion kronor, according to
14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue declined 13 percent
to 20.4 billion kronor.  “Earnings were adversely affected by the decline in
invoicing and reduced production rates,” the company said in a
statement. The strong krona “impacted operating profit by 250
million kronor while changed metal prices had a further impact
of 90 million kronor.”  Sandvik has been cutting jobs and closing factories to cope
with low demand for its products as mining companies hold back
on spending.  Joy Global Inc. (JOY) , the world’s second-biggest mining-equipment maker in August projected a decline in sales due to a
slowdown in demand growth for metals and coal.  Sandvik fell as much as 1.8 percent and was trading down
1.4 percent at 89 kronor as of 8.21 a.m. in Stockholm.  The 151-year-old company has  fallen  14 percent this year,
making it one of the worst performers year-to-date on the  Stoxx
600 Industrial Goods and Services Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
