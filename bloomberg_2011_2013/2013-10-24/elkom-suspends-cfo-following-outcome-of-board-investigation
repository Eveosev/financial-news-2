Telkom SA SOC Ltd. (TKG)  said Chief
Financial Officer Jacques Schindehutte was suspended following
the outcome of an investigation into unspecified allegations
made against him.  “The suspension follows the findings of an investigation
commissioned by the board after certain allegations were made
against Mr Schindehutte,” Africa’s largest fixed-line operator
said in a statement today. “The board has a duty to investigate
and to test the validity of allegations which are brought to its
attention.”  Telkom  shares  fell as much as 4.6 percent, the most since
Aug. 15, and traded 2.5 percent lower at 27.29 rand as of 11:49
a.m. in Johannesburg.  “The board of directors is determined to act responsibly
and to uphold all governance requirements,” Telkom Chief
Executive Officer Sipho Maseko said in a separate e-mailed
statement. The company isn’t in a position to provide further
information, he said.  Schindehutte will be replaced by Deon Fredericks until a
disciplinary process against him is completed, Telkom said. The
Pretoria-based company said on Oct. 8 its first-half earnings
rose more than 20 percent because of lower finance costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
