Brazil ’s real fell on speculation
the central bank will limit rollovers of foreign-exchange swaps
after the currency posted the world’s biggest two-month rally.  The real depreciated 0.3 percent to 2.1976 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:05 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the weakest level on a closing basis
since Oct. 9. Swap rates on contracts maturing in January 2015
were unchanged at 10.49 percent.  “The central bank doesn’t want the real to gain further,”
 Newton Rosa , the chief economist at Sul America Investimentos in
Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview.  Brazil will offer today as much as $1 billion of currency
swaps in a rollover auction after extending the maturities of
$1.98 billion in contracts in the past two days. If the central
bank sells the maximum amount today, it will roll over about
one-third of the $8.9 billion of swaps maturing Nov. 1.  The real has gained 11 percent since Aug. 22, when Brazil
announced a $60 billion program of swaps and credit lines to
buoy the currency and curb import price increases. The real’s
rally also boosts export prices, making the country’s factories
less competitive.  To contact the reporters on this story:
