Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index
reached 189 in Central, the highest reading since April, and
recorded a “very high” reading at all three of the city’s
roadside-monitoring stations, according to the Environmental
Protection Department.  The index was 155 in Causeway Bay and 116 in Mong Kok as of
9 a.m. local time. A reading of more than 100 triggers a
government warning for people with heart or respiratory
illnesses to avoid prolonged stays in heavy-traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
