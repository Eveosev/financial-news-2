Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM) , the fifth-biggest Canadian gold producer, surged the most in almost five
years after the company reported earnings that beat analysts’
estimates and said 2013 production and costs will be better than
it previously forecast.  Agnico  rose  19 percent to C$31.82 at the close in Toronto,
the biggest gain since Nov. 21, 2008.  Third-quarter profit, excluding a non-cash foreign-currency
loss of 4 cents and other one-time items, was 35 cents a share,
the Toronto-based company said in a statement released yesterday
after the close of regular trading. That was almost four times
the 9-cent average of 15  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
fell 17 percent to $444.3 million, beating the $373.7 million
average estimate.  Agnico is among gold producers seeking to curb costs and
cut spending after gold slumped into a  bear market  in April.  “We had expected AEM to beat street estimates going into
Q3 but this surpassed even our expectations,”  Anita Soni , a
Toronto-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a note
yesterday, referring to the ticker Agnico trades under in  Canada 
and the U.S. “The big beat was on better production and costs
than our expectations at every asset, in particular at
Meadowbank.”  Record quarterly output and improved costs at the company’s
Meadowbank mine in Nunavut helped Agnico beat expectations in
the quarter, Chief Executive Officer Sean Boyd said in a
telephone interview.  ‘The Surprise’  “The surprise was Meadowbank,” where ore grades were
higher than expected, Boyd said yesterday. “We expect that
Meadowbank will have a strong fourth quarter,” which will
probably continue into early 2014, he said.  Agnico said it now expects to produce about 1.06 million
ounces of gold this year, as much as 9.3 percent more than a
previous forecast of 970,000 to 1.01 million ounces. The average
cost to produce an ounce of gold, after profiting from the sale
of other metals, will be about $690, Agnico said. The company
forecast $735 to $785 on July 24.  Agnico’s third-quarter  net income  fell to $47.3 million, or
27 cents a share, from $106.3 million, or 62 cents, a year
earlier, the company said.  Gold averaged $1,328 on the Comex in  New York  in the third
quarter, 20 percent less than a year earlier and 6.3 percent
lower than the second quarter.  The largest Canada-based gold producers by sales are
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , Goldcorp Inc., Kinross Gold Corp. and Yamana
Gold Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
