Caixa Geral de Depositos SA  is
selling a stake in Portugal Telecom SGPS SA for as much as 196
million euros ($270 million), as the former phone monopoly
prepares to merge with  Brazil ’s biggest operator.  The state-owned bank is selling about 6.11 percent of
Portugal Telecom, according to a regulatory filing. It had 6.31
percent at the end of June, according to Lisbon-based Portugal
Telecom’s  website . The shares are suspended in Lisbon trading.  Portugal Telecom and Rio de Janeiro-based Oi SA agreed this
month to merge to create a trans-Atlantic carrier whose 100
million customers will make the business more competitive
against  Telefonica SA (TEF)  and America Movil SAB.  Caixa Geral is selling the stake through an accelerated
book building. The shares are being offered at 3.45 euros to
3.583 euros per share, according to the terms of the offer
obtained by  Bloomberg News . Caixa Banco de Investimento and
Credit Suisse are the joint bookrunners. Portugal Telecom shares
dropped 1 percent to 3.583 euros yesterday.  The government ended its “golden share” veto rights in
the company in 2011 to get a bailout from the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
