South  Korea ’s economic growth
exceeded economists’ estimates even as gains in the won weighed
on the country’s exports.  Gross domestic product  rose 1.1 percent in the July-September period from the previous quarter, matching the
increase in April-through-June, the Bank of Korea said today in
a statement in  Seoul . That was above the median 0.8 percent
estimate of 15 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . From a
year earlier, growth was 3.3 percent.  South Korea’s finance ministry yesterday warned that it
would take action if necessary to counter “herd behaviour” in
the  currency market . The won rose about 8 percent against the
dollar since the end of June, the biggest gain in Asia, and
about 6 percent against the yen, Bloomberg data show.  “The economy is pretty in good shape with steady growth,”
Park Sang Hyun, chief economist at HI Investment and Securities
Co. in Seoul, said before the release. “Policy makers may try
to stem the won’s further advance before it saps growth
momentum.”  President Park Geun Hye introduced a 17.3 trillion won ($16
billion) extra budget in May, the same month the  Bank of Korea 
delivered a surprise interest-rate cut, seeking to bolster an
economy that grew 2 percent in 2012, the slowest in three years.  Today’s data showed a 0.6 percent decline in exports from
the previous three months, while private consumption and
facility investment rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
