Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s
largest diversified miner, reported third-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as coal sales rose and costs fell.  Net income  increased to C$267 million ($256 million), or 46
cents a share, from C$256 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier,
the Vancouver-based company said today in a statement. Profit
excluding tax charges and other one-time items was 44 cents a
share, surpassing the 38-cent average of 26  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales rose 0.7 percent to C$2.52 billion, more
than the C$2.27 billion average estimate.  Teck’s coal sales climbed 36 percent from a year earlier to
7.57 million metric tons in the third quarter, while mine
operating costs fell 14 percent to C$50 a ton.  “The most significant contributor to the EPS beat comes
from the coal business,”  Greg Barnes , a Toronto-based analyst
at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said today in a note. Coal sales beat
TD’s estimate of 6.6 million tons and mine-site operating costs
were better than the bank’s $58 a ton projection, Barnes said.  China  imported about 2 million tons of metallurgical coal,
a steelmaking ingredient, from Canada in the first two months of
the quarter, more than double the year-earlier period, according
to the latest  figures  published by the Canadian government.  Teck rose 3.8 percent to C$30.54 at the close in Toronto.
 The shares  have declined 16 percent this year.  Coal accounted for 45 percent of Teck’s revenue in 2012,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The company also mines
copper, which represented 30 percent of sales, and zinc, which
made up 25 percent.  “Results were above expectations with solid operating
results in coal, copper and zinc,” Fraser Phillips, a Toronto-based analyst at Royal Bank of  Canada , said today in a note to
clients. “Both copper sales volumes and coal sales volumes were
above our expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
