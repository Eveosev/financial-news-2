Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  said higher
radiation readings recorded this week in ditch water at its
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant are likely caused by recent
heavy rains washing contaminated dirt into the area.  Water samples taken yesterday at a ditch had beta radiation
levels of 140,000 becquerels per liter, or more than twice the
59,000 becquerels found on Oct. 22 in the same place, the
utility known as Tepco said today in an e-mailed statement.  The  Japan Meteorological Agency ’s Fukushima monitoring
 station  recorded 200.5 milliliters (7.9 inches) of rainfall so
far this month, more than the total for any October since 2006.  The ditch water readings are 14,000 times the limit for
drinking water under health ministry guidelines, though far
below the 80 million becquerels found in water spilled from a
nearby storage tank in August. That incident prompted the
nuclear regulator to raise its alert level and forced the
government to say it would take a bigger role in management of
the plant, crippled by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  Water samples from another ditch had readings of 15,000
becquerels of beta radiation, again higher than the record 2,200
becquerels in an Oct. 1 sample from the same site, Tepco said.
Beta radiation includes strontium-90 linked to causing cancers
such as leukemia.  Worker Mistakes  Tepco said in a separate release that beta radiation levels
of 510,000 becquerels per liter were found Oct. 20 in a sample
of rainwater that had accumulated between a storage tank and a
cement barrier built to contain leaks.  That compares to 450,000 becquerels on Oct. 19 and 360,000
becquerels on Oct. 18, the company said. The Oct. 20 sample was
the highest taken so far from within the barrier, the Sankei
newspaper reported.  Nuclear Regulation Authority Chairman Shunichi Tanaka told
agency commissioners yesterday that he planned to meet Tepco
President Naomi Hirose, saying that the company’s reports on
“careless mistakes” at the plant doesn’t resolve issues.  Six cleanup workers at the atomic station were exposed to
radiation earlier this month after a hose was mistakenly removed
from a filtration system. It was the third mishap in two weeks
that Tepco attributed to mistakes by workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
