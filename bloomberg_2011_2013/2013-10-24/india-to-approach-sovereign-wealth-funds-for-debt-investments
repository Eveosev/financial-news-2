India will approach sovereign wealth
funds to invest in  government securities  as it draws up a plan
to counter outflows when the U.S. Federal Reserve starts
tapering its stimulus.  The government plans to meet officials of sovereign wealth
funds based in  Australia  and West Asia, the official, who asked
not to be identified before a public announcement, told
reporters. The investment will be sought in the underutilized
portion of the $5 billion reserved for such investors.  Greater reliance on foreign capital and bigger borrowings
have seen India suffer more than most of its peers from the
volatility sparked by concern last month that the Fed will pare
back its stimulus. The rupee sank to an all-time low in August
after India’s current-account  deficit  grew to a record $88
billion in the fiscal year ended March 2013, threatening to push
up inflation in a nation that imports 80 percent of its oil.  India’s financial market regulators must shield the economy
from any adverse impact caused by a possible Fed tapering,
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in a statement
today. The Fed will probably wait until March to begin reducing
its quantitative-easing program, according to a survey of
economists conducted Oct. 17-18.  Foreign investors can now buy  government bonds  for as much
as $30 billion, and nearly 80  percent  lies underutilized in the
segment reserved for sovereign wealth, insurance and pension
funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
