Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide
Inc. (HOT) , the owner of the Sheraton and W brands, rose the most in
three months after it reported third-quarter earnings that beat
estimates and forecast an increase in revenue growth for 2014.  Net income totaled $157 million, or 81 cents a share, down
from $170 million, or 87 cents, a year earlier, the  Stamford ,
Connecticut-based company said today in a statement. The average
 estimate  of 14 analysts was 63 cents a share, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Income from continuing operations,
excluding special items, rose to $137 million from $114 million.  Increasing wealth and travel demand in countries Starwood
serves will boost revenue next year, the hotelier said. Revenue
per available room, an industry measure of occupancies and
rates, is likely to grow 5 percent to 7 percent in 2014,
compared with 5 percent to 6 percent this year, Starwood said.  While “the world economy was not altogether on solid
ground in the third quarter,” trends for hotel-demand growth
long term “are intact,” Chief Executive Officer Frits van Paasschen said during a conference call with analysts today.  Starwood rose 4.5 percent to $73.61 at the close in New
York, the biggest increase since July 25 and highest price since
2007.  Demand increased at Starwood’s high-end properties, such as
the Westin chain, in the U.S.,  Italy  and parts of Asia,
according to  Patrick Scholes , an analyst at SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey Inc. in New York. Less than 40 percent of Starwood’s
earnings are from the U.S., according to Nikhil Bhalla, an
analyst at  FBR & Co. (FBRC)  in Arlington, Virginia.  Revenue Rises  Third-quarter revenue climbed 3.6 percent to $1.51 billion,
Starwood said. Revenue per available room, adjusted for currency
fluctuations, rose 4.7 percent worldwide and 5.8 percent in
North America.  The company purchased 2.73 of its shares at a total cost of
about $181 million in the third quarter and an additional 1.14
million shares for about $76 million at the beginning of the
fourth quarter. Starwood boosted its annual dividend by 8
percent to $1.35 a share.  Including sales at its St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort in
 Florida , 2013 adjusted earnings per share before special items
probably will be $2.93 to $2.95, Starwood said. In July, the
company had forecast $2.81 to $2.88. Sales at Bal Harbour are
expected to be completed this year.  Asset sales will reduce 2014 earnings by about $12 million
from this year, Starwood said. The company sold a “non-core
asset” that it didn’t identify for about $12 million in the
third quarter, and agreed to sell two hotels in a deal it
expects to complete by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
