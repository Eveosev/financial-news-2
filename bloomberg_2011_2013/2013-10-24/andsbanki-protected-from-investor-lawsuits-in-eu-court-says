Landsbanki Islands hf, an Icelandic
bank that collapsed in 2008, is shielded from lawsuits by
investors in the European Union after the bloc’s highest court
said a national law blocking such cases against lenders under
reconstruction is also valid outside Iceland.  “The moratorium granted to LBI” is allowed outside the
country under EU law, the  EU Court of Justice  in Luxembourg said
today.  Landsbanki,  Kaupthing Bank hf  and  Glitnir Bank hf  defaulted
on a combined $85 billion in October 2008 after running out of
cash to sustain their debt-funded expansions. The collapse
plunged Iceland’s economy into its worst recession in six
decades, forcing the government to seek an International
Monetary Fund bailout to stay afloat.  Iceland is a member of the  European Economic Area , which
allows it to take part in most of the 28-nation EU’s internal
market. Finance Minister  Bjarni Benediktsson  said this month his
country hasn’t yet decided whether it can commit to an election
pledge to drop its EU accession bid as it awaits the findings of
a report.  The EU court case was triggered by questions from the
French Cour de Cassation about the scope of the Icelandic law in
a case brought by a creditor in  France  seeking to seize some of
Landsbanki’s assets to cover their losses from the default.  The case is:  C-85/12 , Landsbanki Islands HF v Kepler
