Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea ’s
largest carmaker, reported its first profit increase in four
quarters after sales rose in China and demand for hatchbacks
helped boost deliveries in  Brazil .  Third-quarter  net income  climbed 5.6 percent to 2.14
trillion won ($2 billion) from a year earlier, the Seoul-based
company said today. That compares with the 2.15 trillion won
average of 25 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Deliveries in China rose 15 percent and sales from its
Brazil factory reached a record a year after beginning
production in the country. Hyundai is counting on the new
Sonata, which shook up the U.S. midsize sedan market when it was
last overhauled in 2009, to spur demand when it goes on sale
next year.  “I expect Hyundai to struggle a bit for the time being as
the won is strengthening and they don’t have new volume models
coming up until next year,” said Heo Pil Seok, chief executive
officer at Midas International Asset Management Ltd., which
oversees about $7.5 billion including Hyundai’s shares, said by
phone. “The Sonata sedan may help profits once it goes on sale
next year.”  Hyundai  shares  fell 1.9 percent to 253,500 won at the close
in Seoul trading. The shares have gained 16 percent this year,
compared with the 2.5 percent advance in the benchmark Kospi
Index.  China Expansion  The company is meeting growing demand in  China  by expanding
its third plant, which will add 150,000 units a year in output
from January next year, bringing the automaker’s total
production in the country to 1.05 million units.  Hyundai is also considering building a fourth plant in
China and plans to increase the number of dealerships to 1,000
by 2015 from about 800 this year, according to the company.  Total production this year will probably reach more than
4.7 million units, exceeding Hyundai’s forecast by about 1.3
percent, Kim Yeung Tae, deputy chief financial officer, said in
a conference call today.  In Brazil, sales of the HB20 hatchback, designed
specifically for the market, helped Hyundai to book record
quarterly plant sales of 46,578 units in the three months ended
September. The company will increase annual output by 20,000
units in the country from 2014, bringing the total production to
170,000 units, Kim said.  Korean Strikes  The gains from  emerging markets  helped Hyundai cushion the
fallout from a three-week labor strike at its South Korean
plants and slowing sales in the U.S.  Hyundai Motor’s union workers in South Korea approved a
wage deal on Sept. 9 that raised annual compensation by 28.8
million won per person, including an average increase in base
salaries of 5.1 percent, according to the union. That ended
strikes that caused 50,191 vehicles in lost output, according to
company estimates.  The stoppages, which began on Aug. 20, dragged down third-quarter exports from South Korea -- home to 46 percent of the
automaker’s production capacity -- by 3.6 percent, according to
the company’s website.  Stronger Won  The won has gained about 27 percent against the yen in the
past year, curbing affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  and Hyundai’s
competitiveness against Japanese automakers in exporting to the
U.S. The company expects the won to strengthen to 1,070 won
against the dollar in the fourth quarter, Kim said.  Hyundai’s incentives in the U.S. surged 47 percent in the
first nine months of this year, compared with a 2.2 percent
decline at Toyota and the market average of a 2.4 percent
increase, according to Autodata Corp.  The automaker’s sales rose 2.2 percent in the U.S. market
last quarter, trailing the industry’s 8.9 percent growth. Its
deliveries rose 3.7 percent in Europe in the July-to-September
quarter.  The company forecast global auto demand to increase by
about 4 percent to 83.6 million units next year, as demand
recovers in  Europe  and increases in emerging markets including
China.  The Seoul-based company also released renderings today of
its new Genesis sedan, scheduled to go on sale later this year.
Hyundai’s second-most expensive model was also the first by the
company to win the North American Car of the Year in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
