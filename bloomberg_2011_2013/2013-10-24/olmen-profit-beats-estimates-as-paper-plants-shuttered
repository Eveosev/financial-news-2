Holmen AB (HOLMB) , the supplier of pink
paper to the Financial Times, posted third-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates after the company scaled back
unprofitable newsprint production.  Net income fell to 207 million kronor ($32.6 million) from
249 million kronor a year earlier, the Stockholm-based company
said in a statement today. Analysts on average predicted profit
of 192.1 million kronor, according to eight  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales declined 6.9 percent to 3.94 billion kronor.  Holmen has been closing newsprint production units and
cutting its  workforce  as newspapers and magazines move online,
reducing demand for paper. The company is seeking to boost
profit by focusing on products for other industries, such as
catalog publishers, and expanding shipments to faster-growing
countries such as India and  China .  “Demand for printing paper continued to decline but the
market balance for newsprint is good as a result of shutdowns,”
the company said. “There was a significant increase in income
from paperboard.”  Holmen  rose  as much as 1.7 percent and was trading up 1.2
percent at 218.5 kronor as of 2:03 p.m. in  Stockholm . The stock
has gained 14 percent this year, valuing the company at 18.5
billion kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
