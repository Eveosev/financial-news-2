We  love our timepieces  here at  Condé Nast Traveler —they're pretty and functional—but this one takes it to a whole other level. The newly released  Breitling Emergency II  is equipped with a built-in personal locator beacon: When the wearer activates two hidden antennae, a homing device sends out an SOS signal for 24 hours to search and rescue teams around the world. In order to make this possible, Breitling had to get approved GPS coordinates from every nation on earth—meaning you'll never have to fear being stranded on a remote mountainside, or marooned on a desert. Starting at $14,825, it's pricey—but peace of mind during extreme adventures? Priceless. More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
