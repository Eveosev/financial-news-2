West  Texas  Intermediate crude
increased from a four-month low as equities advanced on
corporate earnings and Chinese manufacturing data.  Futures rose 0.3 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index neared a record after a preliminary index of Chinese
manufacturing gained more than forecast this month, while U.S.
factory output expanded at a slower pace than estimated. WTI
fell as much as 0.9 percent earlier on government data that
showed yesterday that U.S. crude  supplies  gained 6.8 percent to
379.8 million barrels in the five weeks ended Oct. 18.  “We dropped close to a four-month low and there was no
follow through, which suggests that the $16 move down over the
last two months is sputtering out,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“Inventories have climbed almost 25 million barrels in the last
five weeks, which sent prices lower. Some of the economic fears
that also put pressure on prices have dissipated.”  WTI crude or December delivery rose 25 cents to settle at
$97.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
contract touched $95.95, the lowest intraday level since June
27. Prices have tumbled since reaching $112.24 during trading on
Aug. 28. The volume of all futures was 12 percent below the 100-day average at 3:11 p.m.  Brent oil for December settlement fell 81 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $106.99 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest close since
Aug. 8. Volume was 1.9 percent higher than the 100-day average.  Brent Premium  The European benchmark crude traded at a $9.88 premium to
WTI at today’s close, down from $10.94 yesterday. The spread
grew to $13.37 during trading yesterday, the most since April.  “WTI was oversold,” said Phil Flynn, a senior market
analyst for Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “Prices have fallen
a great deal and the move was exhausted. The same goes for the
WTI-Brent, which has widened a great deal recently.”  The Purchasing Managers’ Index for  China , the world’s
second-largest oil-consuming country, showed a 50.9 for October,
compared with a 50.4 median estimate from analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. The index was
released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 percent. The S&P 500
has increased 4.2 percent this month, extending the 2013 advance
to 23 percent.  “The only thing keeping the oil market from falling apart
is the relative strength of other risk assets such as stocks,”
said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc. in New York.  U.S. Stockpiles  Nationwide crude inventories climbed 5.25 million barrels
to 379.8 million last week, the most since June 28, the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm, said in a report yesterday. Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the biggest U.S. oil-storage hub and the delivery point for WTI
futures, climbed by 358,000 barrels for a second weekly gain.  Refineries operated at 85.9 percent of capacity, the lowest
level in almost six months, yesterday’s EIA report showed.  “The supply build yesterday was really massive,” said
Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC in Austin.
“The market is flooded right now and until we see refiners
boost operating rates, supplies are going remain elevated and
WTI will be under pressure. The Brent-WTI spread will stay wide
until the refinery demand picks up here and supplies drop.”  Surging Output  U.S. crude  production  grew 6.3 percent last week to 7.9
million barrels a day, the most since March 1989. A combination
of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,
has unlocked supplies in shale formations in North Dakota, Texas
and other states.  WTI may extend its slide below $100 a barrel through the
end of the year as U.S. supplies surge, easing concern that
 Iran ’s nuclear activities will lead to armed conflict and that
continuing political wrangling in  Washington  will curb economic
growth, a Bloomberg survey on prices showed. Futures were
projected to close at $97 on Dec. 31, according to the mean of
16 analysts and traders surveyed by on Oct. 21.  “It looks like WTI has touched a bottom for now,” said
Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “We will have to see another
inventory gain or a change in the geopolitical picture to spur
another move lower.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
December was 20.4 percent, down from 21.4 percent yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 481,500
contracts as of 3:12 p.m. It totaled 725,935 contracts
yesterday, 24 percent higher than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.77 million contracts, the least since July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
