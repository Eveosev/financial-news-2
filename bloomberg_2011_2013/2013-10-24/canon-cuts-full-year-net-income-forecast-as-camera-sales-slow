Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest
camera maker, cut its annual profit forecast and predicted its
first drop in sales of models with an interchangeable lens as
consumers switch to smartphones to take photos.  Net income  will probably total 240 billion yen ($2.5
billion) for the year ending December, the Tokyo-based company
said in a statement yesterday, cutting its earlier forecast of
260 billion yen. The new projection missed the 250.8 billion-yen
 average  of 21 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Smartphones are eating into digital camera sales as
companies such as Apple Inc. and Sony Corp. release new handsets
with stronger built-in lenses and sensors to lure shoppers. The
value of worldwide camera shipments dropped 19 percent in August
from a year earlier, a ninth consecutive monthly decline,
according to the Camera & Imaging Products  Association  in  Tokyo .  “The downward revision is larger than expected and will
have a negative effect on Canon’s  stock  price,” said Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based fund manager at Mizuho Asset Management Co.
“Smartphones are creating a structural problem for camera
manufacturers.”  The company that started in an apartment in the Tokyo
district of Roppongi in 1933, cut its annual sales target for
single single-lens-reflex models to 8 million from 9 million.
Canon kept its target for compact cameras at 14 million units.  Weaker Yen  The maker of EOS models, which also manufactures printers,
facsimile machines and medical equipment,  fell  0.2 percent to
3,130 yen in Tokyo trading yesterday. It’s  dropped  6.3 percent
this year, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average has
surged 39 percent.  The decline in demand for interchangeable lens cameras
stems from sluggish economies especially in Europe and Asia,
Chief Financial Officer Toshizo Tanaka, told reporters in Tokyo
yesterday. “It’s a temporal decline and we expect demand to
pick up next year as the global economy recovers.”  The company spent 50 billion yen buying back its own shares
last month after the stock tumbled to close at 2,935 yen on
Sept. 2, the lowest since December 2012.  The company also reduced its estimate for operating profit
to 360 billion yen for the year, from 380 billion yen, predicted
three months ago. Annual sales will be 3.75 trillion, down from
an earlier projection of 3.85 trillion.  The impact of lower camera sales is being cushioned partly
by cost reductions at Canon and a weaker Japanese yen. The lower
currency boosts the repatriated value of Japanese exporters’
overseas earnings.  Exchange Rates  Canon revised its assumption on the yen exchange rate to 97
yen to the U.S. dollar and 130 yen to the euro, from 95 yen and
125 yen projected three months ago respectively.  The U.S. dollar traded at an average of 98.89 yen during
the three months ended September, compared with 78.64 yen a year
earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The euro averaged at
131.05 yen in the latest quarter, compared with 98.4 yen a year
earlier.  Canon also posted third-quarter earnings with operating
profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative
expenses, of 90.6 billion yen on revenue of 913.1 billion yen.
Net income was 58.8 billion yen.  Operating income at the  office products unit , Canon’s
biggest division making copiers and multi-function printers,
increased 63 percent to 67 billion yen in the quarter as revenue
rose 21 percent.  Operating income at the imaging system division, which
handles cameras, rose 8.2 percent to 56.9 billion yen in the
quarter ended Sept. 30 as revenue gained 8.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
