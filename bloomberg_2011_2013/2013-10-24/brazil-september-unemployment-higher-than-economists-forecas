Brazil ’s  unemployment  rate was
higher than economists forecast in September, as the central
bank boosts rates to tame above-target inflation.  The jobless rate rose to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent in
August, the national statistics agency said in Rio de Janeiro
today. That was higher than  forecast  by 35 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg, whose median estimate was 5.3 percent. Even with
the increase, the rate tied the record low for the month, set
last year.  The world’s second-biggest emerging economy has seen
unemployment hover near historic lows even as growth faltered
during the first two years of President Dilma Rousseff’s
administration. The low jobless rate has added pressure to
inflation, which the central bank is attempting to rein in with
the greatest rate-raising cycle among major economies.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 10.47 percent at 9:02 a.m. local time. The
real weakened 0.3 percent to 2.1969 per  U.S. dollar .  Brazil’s  inflation  rate in the month through mid-October
slowed to 5.75 percent, its lowest since mid-November last year
while still above the 4.5 percent midpoint of the central bank’s
target range. To stem inflation, the bank has boosted the
benchmark  Selic (BZSTSETA)  rate by 225 basis points since April in five
monetary policy meetings.  The  labor force  remained stable at 24.5 million people in
September as the number of unemployed rose 2.5 percent to 1.3
million, the statistics agency said. The agency surveys the job
market in six of Brazil’s metropolitan areas.  Brazil’s economy  created  211,068 government-registered jobs
in September, the most since April 2012 and beating all
estimates of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The economy in 2011 and 2012  grew  at its slowest two-year
pace in more than a decade. In the second quarter, gross
domestic product  expanded  1.5 percent, its fastest pace in more
than three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
