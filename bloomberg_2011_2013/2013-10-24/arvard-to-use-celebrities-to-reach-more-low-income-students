Harvard University  is enlisting
actor  Matt Damon  and basketball player Jeremy Lin as part of an
initiative to encourage low-income students to apply to the
college and other selective universities.  The Harvard College Connection will use a  video  that
features Damon, Lin and other former and current students, as
well as social media and personal outreach, to connect high
school students with the university, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Harvard said today in an e-mail.  Most high-achieving students from low-income families don’t
apply to selective universities, even though many schools offer
financial aid, according to a 2012  report  by the  National Bureau
of Economic Research . One reason is that there are often just
one or two such students at high schools in low-income areas,
and it’s inefficient for admissions officers to visit them, the
report found. While Harvard travels to more than 140 cities and
towns every year, the new program is intended to reach more
schools,  William Fitzsimmons , dean of admissions and financial
aid, said in the e-mail.  “To ensure that talented low-income students understand
their opportunities, we need to meet them where they are,”
Fitzsimmons said. “To date, that has meant literally traveling
to meet them in cities and towns across the nation. Going
forward, we will meet them in person and online.”  Harvard said it will encourage students to apply to other
selective universities as well as Harvard because most students
attend college within a few hundred miles of their home.  To contact the reporter on this story:
