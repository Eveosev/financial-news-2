Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) , the largest
publicly traded U.S. firearms maker, fell the most in 10 months
today after hunting and fishing store Cabela’s Inc. reported a
decline in gun sales.  Shares of Southport, Connecticut-based Sturm dropped 6.7
percent to $63.31 at 3:42 p.m., after declining 7.3 percent for
the largest intraday decline since Dec. 18.  Smith & Wesson
Holding Corp. (SWHC)  also fell.  “Starting in August, we saw a significant deceleration in
the sales of firearms and ammunition,” Cabela’s Chief Executive
Officer Thomas Millner said in an earnings filing today.  Cabela’s, based in Sidney, Nebraska-based, saw a 2.5
percent decline in same-store firearms sales last quarter,
Millner said on a conference call. The retailer’s stock reversed
losses and gained 0.4 percent to $62.66.  Smith & Wesson, of Springfield, Massachusetts, declined 3.3
percent to $10.78.  To contact the reporter on this story:
