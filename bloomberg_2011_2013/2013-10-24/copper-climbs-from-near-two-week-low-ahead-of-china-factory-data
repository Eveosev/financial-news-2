Copper rebounded after slumping by
the most in 12 weeks before a report that may show manufacturing
expanded in  China , the biggest metals user.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange rose 0.4 percent to $7,196.50 a metric ton by
9:51 a.m. in  Seoul . The price lost as much as 2.2 percent
yesterday, the biggest drop since July 30, on concern that China
may tighten its policies. Copper fell 9.2 percent this year.  A private gauge of Chinese manufacturing from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics today may signal a third month of
expansion. The Purchasing Managers’ Index is likely to have
climbed to 50.4 this month from 50.2 in September, a Bloomberg
survey shows. Levels above 50 signal expansion. Economic growth
accelerated for the first time in three quarters last quarter
and factory output grew 10.2 percent last month.  “Manufacturing in China hasn’t been that bad, with the
index staying above 50,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior metals
trader at Seoul-based Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. “Still,
it remains to be seen whether China will actually tighten its
policies.”  Futures for delivery in December increased 0.2 percent at
$3.275 a pound on the Comex in New York. Copper for delivery in
January on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.6 percent to
51,810  yuan  ($8,410) a ton.  On the LME, aluminum rose, while lead and nickel fell. Zinc
was little changed and tin hadn’t traded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
