New Zealand ’s dollar may fall to the
weakest in almost six weeks versus the greenback after the
currency failed to strengthen past this year’s high set in
April, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., citing technical
indicators.  The South-Pacific currency may drop to as low as 81.40 U.S.
cents, the least since Sept. 16, Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in a research note
today. That level is around the 38.2 percent retracement of the
currency’s 2013 decline, and its 200-day moving average. A close
below 85.01 tomorrow, which was almost the closing level on Oct.
18, would confirm a weekly bearish reversal pattern, O’Connor
said.  ”This week’s decline, after failing below the April highs,
suggests some additional short-term consolidation is likely,”
O’Connor said. “Support at the recent 83.50 breakout zone takes
on added importance.”  The kiwi depreciated 0.8 percent, following a 1.4 percent
slump yesterday, to 83.30 U.S. cents in  New York . It touched
83.28, the lowest since Oct. 14.  The currency declined 3.6 percent during the past six
months, the worst performance after  Australia ’s dollar,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-country currencies.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
