The  International Monetary Fund 
wants the U.S. to find a lasting plan for dealing with its
fiscal woes, while the fund welcomes the temporary agreement on
raising the borrowing limit, a spokesman said.  “There needs to be a durable solution to the debt ceiling
and uncertainty is not a healthy condition,” the IMF’s  William
Murray  said at a press conference in Washington. “The U.S.
needs to come up with a clear medium-term plan for dealing with
its fiscal challenges.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
