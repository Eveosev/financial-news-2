AutoNation Inc. (SAH) , the largest U.S.
retailer of new cars and trucks, reported quarterly profit that
rose 13 percent as its sales outpaced an industry on track for
its best year since 2007.  Third-quarter net income increased to $92.6 million from
$81.6 million a year earlier, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based
company said today in a statement. Profit from continuing
operations climbed 14 percent to 75 cents a share, trailing the
77-cent average  estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales increased 14 percent to $4.47 billion.  AutoNation Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson has touted
a housing recovery in  California  and  Florida  and surging energy
production in Texas and  Colorado , all among the states with the
most AutoNation franchises. The dealer group’s presence in those
regions has paced an 11 percent increase in the company’s retail
sales of new vehicles through the year’s first nine months.  “We have very dense positions in those markets,” Jackson,
64, said in a telephone interview. “We have the best offering
of products ever, and there is still good discipline on the
incentive side. It’s a very healthy industry.”  AutoNation forecasts industrywide U.S. vehicle sales to
climb to the mid-15 million-unit range in 2013 from 14.5 million
last year. Deliveries of cars and light trucks rose 8.1 percent
to 11.8 million this year through September, according to
researcher Autodata Corp.  AutoNation rose 1.7 percent to $49.41 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 24 percent this year, compared with
the 23 percent increase for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) ’s
increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
