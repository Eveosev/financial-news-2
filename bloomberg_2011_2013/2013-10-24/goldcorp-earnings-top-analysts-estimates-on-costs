Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the largest gold
miner by market value, reported third-quarter earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates after costs rose less than expected.  Net income  fell to $5 million, or break even per share,
from $498 million, or 61 cents, a year earlier, the Vancouver-based company said today in a statement. Profit excluding one-time items was 23 cents a share, exceeding the 20-cent average
of 19  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined to $929
million from $1.28 billion.  Goldcorp, which operates mines in North and South America,
wrote down the value of its assets by $1.96 billion in July and
is slowing some project spending and seeking to cut costs after
gold slipped into a  bear market  in April. The company is
building new mines in  Canada  and  Argentina .  Goldcorp’s third-quarter gold production rose to 637,100
ounces from 592,500 ounces a year earlier. Eight analysts
estimated an average of 683,100 ounces of output.  The company’s average cost to produce and sell gold, after
profiting from sales of silver and other metals, was $551 an
ounce, compared with $220 an ounce in the third quarter of 2012
and the $554 average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold averaged $1,328 on the Comex in New York in the third
quarter, 20 percent less than a year earlier and 6.3 percent
lower than the second quarter.  Goldcorp fell 1.6 percent to C$26.57 yesterday in Toronto.
 The shares  have declined 27 percent this year.  Toronto-based  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  is the world’s biggest
gold producer by sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
