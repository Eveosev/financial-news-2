Shire Plc (SHP)  rose the most in seven
years after increasing its full-year profit forecast as a
reorganization of the U.K. drugmaker led to lower costs.  Shire soared 9.3 percent to close at a record 2,760 pence
in  London , the biggest intraday advance since October 2006,
giving the U.K. company a market value of 15.3 billion pounds
($24.8 billion).  The percentage increase in profit excluding some items this
year will be in the mid to high teens because the company sees
benefits from its cost cutting, Shire said today in a statement.
Previously the company forecast “double-digit” growth. Since
taking over in May, Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov has
attempted to unite the separate drug units and trim overlap.  “The clear message is unappreciated operating leverage,”
Peter Welford, an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd., said
in a report to clients. The results are an “important explicit
outline for lower future spend.”  Revenue for the company’s top selling drug, Vyvanse for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, increased 21 percent
to $299 million. Shire is based in Dublin and has executive
offices in Basingstoke,  England .  To contact the reporter on this story:
