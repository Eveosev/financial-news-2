Palm oil  declined the most in four
weeks after a rally to a seven-month high spurred some investors
to lock in gains.  The contract for delivery in January retreated 0.9 percent
to 2,461 ringgit ($780) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the biggest drop at close for the most-active
futures since Sept. 26. Palm for physical delivery in November
was at 2,455 ringgit today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Futures rallied for the fourth day yesterday to close at
the highest level since March on speculation that output in
Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer, may increase at a
slower pace and cap inventories. The commodity, used in
everything from noodles to biofuels, has gained 6.1 percent this
month, erasing losses this year.  “There has been some profit taking after the recent good
run,” said Donny Khor, deputy director of futures and
commodities at RHB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “This
is a breather before a bull run as the underlying market is
looking positive on expectations of lower production.”  Soybeans for delivery in January fell 0.2 percent to $13.02
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while  soybean oil  for
December was unchanged at 41.50 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for May delivery dropped 0.9 percent to
close at 6,124  yuan  ($1,007) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  and soybean oil fell 0.2 percent to end at 7,202 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
