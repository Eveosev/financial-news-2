(Corrects to clarify name of entity involved in tax case
in headline, from first paragraph.)  Nordic Capital’s Swedish advisory
firm NC Advisory AB is confident it will win a court case
against  Sweden ’s tax agency, which demands that private equity
firm pays retroactive additional taxes of SK702m,  Dagens
Industri  reports, citing NC Advisory.
* Nordic Capital’s Swedish advisory firm has consulted more than
20 lawyers, which are all convinced it will win, its CFO Klas Tikkanen says, according to Dagens Industri
* Court proceedings involving NC Advisory, tax agency start
later this year; final ruling likely before Christmas: DI
* NC Advisory has SK75m in own capital and wouldn’t be able to
pay the tax authorities’ demand if it loses the case and payment
of the additional taxes isn’t deferred; would need more capital
to avoid bankruptcy if it loses case: Tikkanen
