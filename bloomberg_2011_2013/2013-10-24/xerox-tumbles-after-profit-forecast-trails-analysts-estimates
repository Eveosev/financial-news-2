Xerox Corp. (XRX) , the printer and copier
pioneer, fell the most in more than four years after its
forecast trailed analysts’ estimates, raising concerns about the
company’s attempt to shift into business services.  Excluding some items, earnings will be 28 cents to 30 cents
in the fourth quarter, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company
said today in a statement. Analysts had predicted 33 cents on
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Ursula Burns , who took the helm in
2009, is moving the company toward consulting and services in a
bid to boost profit. The shares had climbed 57 percent this year
through yesterday amid optimism that the turnaround is taking
root. Now after two strong quarters, bookings looked weak in the
most recent period, said Keith Bachman, a New York-based analyst
at BMO Capital Markets Corp.  “We are disappointed with the services revenues, margins
and bookings,” he said in a report.  The shares fell 10 percent to $9.61, the biggest one-day
decline since September 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
