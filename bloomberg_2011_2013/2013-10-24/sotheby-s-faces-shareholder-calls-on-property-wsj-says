Sotheby’s (BID)  shareholder Marcato
Capital Management LLC wants the auction house to sell its New
York and London properties and use short-term debt to fund some
operations to free up $1.3 billion in cash, the Wall Street
Journal reported.  Richard McGuire, Marcato’s founder, unveiled the plan for
boosting Sotheby’s ability to return cash to shareholders at a
conference in San Francisco, the Journal said. He told investors
the stock could rise to $68 if the measures are adopted, the
newspaper said. Sotheby’s shares closed at $52.58 yesterday in
New York.  Sotheby’s adopted a shareholder-rights plan on Oct. 4 to
protect itself from hostile takeovers after hedge-fund manager
Daniel Loeb increased his stake in the New York-based auctioneer
and called on Chief Executive Officer William Ruprecht to
resign. In September, Sotheby’s said it’s reviewing capital
allocation and financial policies and that Patrick McClymont, an
investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., would replace
Chief Financial Officer William Sheridan.  Sotheby’s stock has risen 56 percent this year, valuing the
company at $3.6 billion. Marcato has a 6.7 percent stake, while
Loeb’s Third Point LLC owns 9.3 percent, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
