The Mexican peso’s implied
volatility rose to a one-week high as analysts forecast policy
makers will lower borrowing costs for a third time this year to
shore up growth in  Latin America ’s second-biggest economy.  One-month implied volatility on options for the peso, which
reflects expectations for future price fluctuations, rose to
11.41 percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest closing level since Oct.
15. The currency increased 0.2 percent today to 12.9669 per
dollar.  The central bank will lower the target lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to a record low 3.5 percent tomorrow
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The rate was cut by a quarter point last month and a
half point in March,  “In theory this should cause a depreciation in the
 exchange rate ,”  Mario Copca , a currency and fixed-income
strategist at said by phone from Mexico City. “At the same time
it should generate more implied volatility in the options
market.”  The national statistics agency reported today that a proxy
for economic activity climbed 0.84 percent in August from a year
earlier, slower than the 1 percent median forecast of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  While Mexican  consumer prices  increased 0.4 percent in the
first half of October, more than economists projected, annual
inflation slowed to 3.27 percent, approaching the central bank’s
3 percent target.  Yields on inflation-linked bonds maturing in December 2014
rose three basis points to minus 0.54 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
