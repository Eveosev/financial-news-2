Parliaments across the euro region
should have more say in approving rescue measures related to the
debt crisis, including the resolution of banks, a senior
lawmaker from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party said.  By copying  Germany ’s model, where all European rescue
efforts that impact the budget need lawmaker approval, euro
region governments and parliaments would bolster the legitimacy
of their actions and increase support for  Europe  in their
electorates,  Norbert Barthle , the top budget lawmaker in
Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union , said yesterday.  “For us, it will be a major task in the coming months to
ensure in future negotiations at European level that the
feedback of European policy decisions into national parliaments
is strengthened,” Barthle said in an interview in Berlin. “We
have already created the relevant legislation here in Germany.
We would welcome it if similar procedures were also found for
other national parliaments.”  The 28 European Union states have set a year-end deadline
to reach a common position on a proposal for a Single Resolution
Mechanism that would centralize the handling of euro-area banks
in financial trouble. Merkel, at a meeting of EU leaders in
Brussels today, will present a proposal that includes national
parliaments’ involvement, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper
reported yesterday.  Merkel would support an SRM if claims on lenders were first
met by shareholders and creditors; the euro region would bear
joint responsibility only for 130 banks out of a total 6,000;
and all national legislatures are required to agree to
government assistance, the Sueddeutsche said, without saying
where it got the information.  “As desirable as European banking supervision is: If all
of a sudden there’s a decision at European level that bank X in
country X has to be closed, without the involvement of the
nation concerned, that’s when it becomes difficult,” Barthle
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
