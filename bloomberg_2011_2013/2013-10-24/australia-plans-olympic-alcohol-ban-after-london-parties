Australia  will ban team members from
drinking alcohol in the athlete’s village at the Rio 2016
Olympics after some held parties at last year’s games that
disrupted their teammates.  Australia finished 10th on the medal table at the 2012
games in London with 35 medals, its worst display since
Barcelona 1992.  Leigh Nugent, Australia’s head swimming coach, quit in
March after a review found that the Olympic swimming team was
beset by “culturally toxic incidents” including misuse of
 prescription drugs , drunkenness, curfew breaches, deceit and
bullying.  “Problems occurred at the London 2012 Olympics with
athletes holding parties and disrupting fellow team members who
were waiting to compete,” the Australian Olympic Committee, or
AOC, said in a statement.  The alcohol ban will apply to athletes and officials, Kitty
Chiller, Australia’s team leader, said.  “We will be expecting an extremely high standard of
behavior in Rio,” Chiller, who competed in the modern
pentathlon at the Sydney games in 2000, said. “Bad behavior
will not be tolerated.”  Australia finished 4th in the medal table at the Sydney
games and retained that position in  Athens  in 2004. Four years
later, in Beijing, it finished 6th.  “Climbing back into the top five is paramount,” the AOC
said, adding that Chiller is focused on creating a united team.  Editor: Chris Elser, Alex Duff  To contact the reporter on this story:
