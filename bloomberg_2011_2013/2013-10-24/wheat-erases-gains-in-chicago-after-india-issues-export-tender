Wheat erased gains in  Chicago  after
 India  issued a tender to export the grain, signaling more
supplies for the livestock industry.  India State Trading is seeking to export 120,000 metric
tons of milling wheat from Mundra port during Nov. 24-Dec. 20,
according to a notice on its website today. The grain rallied to
a four-month high on Oct. 21 on speculation that crop damage in
Russia and Argentina would boost demand for U.S. supply.  “India’s wheat is likely to be assigned a significant
discount because of potential quality concerns and question
marks over how many tenders they will be eligible for,” said
Kieran Walsh, a broker at Aurel BGC in Paris. “They’ve
potentially got 30 million tons of this.”  Wheat for December delivery dropped 0.3 percent to $6.995 a
bushel at 7:36 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
earlier today climbed 0.9 percent. Corn declined 0.3 percent and
soybeans fell less than 0.1 percent.  Milling wheat futures slumped 1 percent in Paris.  Wheat futures cost $2.6425 a bushel more than corn on Oct.
18, the most since September 2010.  “Wheat now looks fully valued against corn,”  Paul Deane ,
senior agriculture economist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in  Melbourne . “We now view the price premium wheat
has built over corn as high enough in limiting milling wheat
sales into the animal feed sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
