Reigning Olympic women’s downhill
skiing champion  Lindsey Vonn  will skip the season-opening World
Cup race this weekend in Soelden, Austria, as she continues to
recover from February knee surgery.  Vonn, who turned 29 six days ago, said she plans to return
to the World Cup tour in late November in Beaver Creek, Colorado.  “While I physically feel great, I have decided to not race
this weekend and instead will focus on returning in Beaver
Creek,” Vonn said in a statement posted last night on the U.S.
Ski Team’s website. “I am confident the extra month of training
will ultimately put me in the best position to have a successful
season.”  Vonn, an American who is a four-time overall  World Cup 
champion and has won six straight downhill season titles, had
surgery to repair two knee ligaments and a fractured bone in her
right leg after a Feb. 5 crash at the World Ski Championships in
Schladming, Austria.  Vonn worked with her U.S. teammates in Europe this week
before deciding to return home to continue training.  The Soelden giant slalom on Oct. 26 is the opening women’s
race on this year’s World Cup tour, and will be followed by a
Nov. 16 slalom in Levi,  Finland . The tour then moves to  North
America  for races Nov. 29 in Beaver Creek and Dec. 6 in Lake
Louise, Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
