Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-largest U.S. cable provider, agreed to carry  Al Jazeera  America,
bringing the Qatar-based broadcaster to millions of viewers in
New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and other cities.  The channel will be added to basic-cable plans for
customers of New York-based Time Warner Cable and Bright House
Networks over the next six months, according to a statement
today. The agreement will make Al Jazeera available to almost 55
million homes.  Al Jazeera America debuted in August, aiming to provide
Americans with a cable-news alternative to MSNBC, Fox News and
CNN. The network, controlled by the Qatari royal family, paid
$500 million for Al Gore’s money-losing Current TV in January
and rebranded it. Al Jazeera America markets itself as a source
of unbiased reporting on topics such as health-care reform and
gun violence.  Time Warner Cable had initially dropped Current after Al
Jazeera’s purchase, though it soon began negotiating to bring
the channel back to its lineup. The Qatar company also has deals
with  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , DirecTV and  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  for BeIN
Sport, a group of channels it owns in France, the U.S. and
Canada that have rights to European soccer leagues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
