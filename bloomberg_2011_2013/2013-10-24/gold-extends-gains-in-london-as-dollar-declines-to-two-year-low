Gold futures rose to a three-week
high on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will maintain the
pace of monetary stimulus to boost economic growth, spurring
demand for the metal as a store of value.  Fed policy makers will delay reducing $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases until March, according to the median
estimate of 40 economists in a Bloomberg survey last week. The
16-day U.S. government shutdown that started Oct. 1 probably
trimmed 0.25 percentage point from fourth-quarter economic
growth and cost 120,000 jobs this month, according to  Jason
Furman , President  Barack Obama ’s chief economic adviser.  “The stimulus story is lending support to gold,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “Worries about the health of the  U.S.
economy  are pushing some to gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery added 1.2 percent to
settle at $1,350.30 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, prices climbed to $1,352.30, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 30.  The precious metal has dropped 19 percent this year,
heading for the first annual decline since 2000. Some investors
lost faith in the metal amid a rally in U.S. equities and low
inflation.  Bullion rose 70 percent from December 2008 to June 2011 as
the Fed pumped more than $2 trillion into the financial system.  Silver futures for December delivery gained 0.9 percent to
$22.822 an ounce in New York, after touching $22.91, the highest
since Sept. 20. Trading was 39 percent below average for the
past 100 days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery increased 1.2 percent to $1,456.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$747.80 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
