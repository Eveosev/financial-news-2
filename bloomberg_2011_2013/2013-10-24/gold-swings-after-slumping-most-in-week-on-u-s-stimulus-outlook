Gold was little changed after its
biggest loss in more than a week as investors weighed the
outlook for the  Federal Reserve ’s stimulus measures before a
government report today that may show jobless claims decreased.  Bullion for immediate delivery was at $1,334.01 an ounce by
8:42 a.m. in  Singapore  after retreating as much as 0.2 percent.
Prices fell 0.5 percent to $1,333.42 yesterday, the biggest loss
at close since Oct. 11. Gold for December delivery was little
changed at $1,333.80 an ounce on the Comex.  Jobless claims in the U.S. probably decreased to 340,000 in
the week ended Oct. 19 from 358,000 in the prior period,
according to a Bloomberg  survey . Gold climbed to the highest in
three weeks on Oct. 22 after U.S. employers added fewer jobs in
September than economists had estimated, spurring bets the Fed
may maintain its $85 billion monthly bond purchases. Bullion
lost 20 percent this year amid speculation the central bank will
curb the asset purchases.  “We had poor U.S. payrolls data that gave more confidence
that tapering would be delayed,” said Alexandra Knight, an
economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. If today’s jobless
data “came out positively, then you could have a reverse of
what we’ve seen over recent days. People might be thinking
tapering is now more likely to happen sooner rather than
later,” she said by phone from  Melbourne .  Policy makers unexpectedly refrained last month from
slowing the bond buying. The central bank will delay a reduction
in the stimulus until March, according to economists in an Oct.
17-18 Bloomberg survey. Gold rose 70 percent from December 2008
to June 2011 as the Fed pumped more than $2 trillion into the
financial system to boost the economy.  Silver for immediate delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$22.6225 an ounce after dropping as much as 0.7 percent.
Platinum advanced 0.5 percent to $1,440.78 an ounce, while
palladium rose 0.2 percent to $747.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
