Posco (005490) ,  South Korea ’s biggest
steelmaker, cut its 2013 sales forecast for a second time after
reporting a 22 percent slump in third-quarter profit.  The company’s full-year  sales  estimate on a group basis was
lowered to 63 trillion won ($59.4 billion), from a July
prediction of 64 trillion won, Pohang-based Posco said today in
an e-mailed statement.  The lower forecast, which followed an April reduction,
comes after an economic slowdown in  China , the world’s biggest
steel user, and  Europe ’s debt crisis cut consumption and prices.
Posco said today it would make “all efforts” to improve
earnings as global steel demand is expected to recover this
quarter.  “Posco’s third-quarter operating profit was lower than I
presumed,” said Will Byun, an analyst at Woori Investment &
Securities Co. in  Seoul . “Steel prices will be generally weak
until the end of this year. I expect a rise in prices at the end
of the fourth quarter, but I don’t think it will be huge.”  Net income excluding minority interest was 567 billion won
in the three months ended Sept. 30, from 730.8 billion won a
year ago, the company said. That missed the 650.3 billion won
average of 13 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Posco, which has lost 7.9 percent this year, rose 0.5
percent to end at 321,500 won in Seoul trading, while the
benchmark  Kospi index  added 0.5 percent. The announcement came
after the stock market closed.  ‘Better Performance’  Operating profit slumped 38 percent to 632.8 billion won,
missing the 699.2 billion average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales fell 3.7 percent to 15.2 trillion won.
Operating  margin  shrank to 4.2 percent last quarter from 6.5
percent a year earlier.  “Third-quarter results were below market expectations,”
Shim Tong Wook, a senior vice president at Posco, said today on
a conference call. “But we expect to have a significantly
better performance in the fourth quarter.”  Posco will seek to raise some steel prices this quarter as
international prices look like recovering, said Kim Jae Yeol,
senior vice president for marketing. Global steel consumption
may grow 3 percent next year as Chinese demand picks up, the
company said.  Posco’s average selling price fell 12 percent to 773,000
won a metric ton in the third quarter, it said. Crude steel
output dropped 7.6 percent to 8.9 million tons in the quarter
from a year earlier, while sales fell 7.3 percent to 8.3 million
tons.  Earnings may improve in the current quarter as profits are
booked from unit  Daewoo International Corp. (047050) ’s Myanmar gas
project, according to Bang Min Jin, a steel analyst at HI
Investment & Securities Co. Daewoo began selling gas from
Myanmar in July.  The stock has “limited upside potential” because of weak
prices amid oversupply and continued market-share losses to
 Hyundai Steel Co. (004020)  and Hyundai Hysco Co., Chung Sung Yop, a steel
analyst at Daiwa Securities Co., wrote in an Oct. 16 report.
Chung has a hold rating for Posco.  To contact the reporters on this story:
