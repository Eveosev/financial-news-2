Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR) , a U.K. oil and gas
explorer in Africa, jumped the most in seven months in London
after saying it began talks to sell assets in Tanzania.  Ophir rose 9.1 percent, the biggest gain since March 5, to
326.70 pence. It was the  best performer  on the Stoxx Europe 600
Oil & Gas Index. The company “has a process ongoing to sell
down a part-interest” in Tanzania’s Blocks 1, 3 and 4, the
London-based explorer said today in a statement. “There is no
certainty that this process will conclude successfully.”  Ophir has been seeking partners to share costs in Gabon,
 Equatorial Guinea , Kenya and Tanzania after exploration was
slower than forecast. While drilling delays have weighed on its
stock, the company and project operator  BG Group Plc (BG/)  have now
found enough gas to start building a liquefied natural gas plant
in Tanzania, helping to meet growing fuel demand in Asia.  India’s  Financial Express  reported earlier that Ophir may
sell some of its Tanzanian assets to  GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL)  The New
Delhi-based gas-marketing company may buy 10 percent to 30
percent stakes in five blocks for at least $600 million, the
newspaper said, citing an unidentified official at GAIL.  Ophir Chief Executive Officer Nick Cooper wasn’t
immediately available to comment.  The report is “positive,” FirstEnergy Capital LLP said in
an e-mailed note. “Any clarity on the agreement of a definitive
farm-out will be welcomed by investors.”  Ophir holds 40 percent stakes in Blocks 1, 3 and 4, where
BG Group is the operator with a 60 percent interest. Ophir has
declined 26 percent this year in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
