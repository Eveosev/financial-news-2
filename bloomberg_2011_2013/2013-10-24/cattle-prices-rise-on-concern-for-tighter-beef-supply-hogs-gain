Cattle futures rose for the second
time in three sessions on mounting concern that U.S. beef output
is dropping as demand increases. Hog prices increased.  Beef output probably will drop 6 percent next year and 2
percent to 3 percent in 2015,  David Anderson , a Texas A&M
University economist said Oct. 22 at a conference in Chicago.
The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  forecast last month that
production this year will fall 1.2 percent to the lowest since
2005. Wholesale-beef  prices  this year averaged $1.94 a pound,
the highest on record going back to 2004, USDA data show.  “The fear of tighter supplies is the real flame under this
market,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson
Group in  Yates City , Illinois, said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1.3305 a pound at 10:44 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are up 0.8 percent since Oct. 18, heading for
the biggest weekly gain this month. Feeder-cattle futures for
January settlement declined 0.3 percent to $1.6715 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement increased 0.8 percent
to 88.85 cents a pound on the CME, after touching 89.35 cents,
the highest since Oct. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
