Benin  is set to resume crude output
after South Atlantic Petroleum Ltd., a closely held Nigerian oil
company, said it will start pumping the fuel from the country’s
Seme fields offshore.  The company, known as Sapetro, will pump 7,500 barrels a
day from Seme’s block 1 for 14 years, Executive Vice Chairman
Daisy Danjuma said on state-owned television. The country and
the company have yet to finalize how output will be shared.  “Benin will be seen as an oil-producing country,” Energy
Minister Barthelemy Kassa said, according to a statement from
the presidential press office, based in the port city of
Cotonou, the commercial capital.  The West African nation’s $7.3 billion economy relies on
agriculture including cotton to generate more than a third of
total output and provide employment for 70 percent of its
workforce, according to the African Development Bank. The
country neighbors Nigeria, the continent’s biggest crude
producer and most populous nation. Benin’s oil output peaked at
8,000 barrels a day in 1986 and it hasn’t produced since 2004,
according to the  U.S. Energy Information Administration .  About a 37 percent of Benin’s citizens live in poverty,
according to the CIA World Factbook.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the biggest oil producer in deep
waters, in March said it had sold a stake in Benin’s block 4 to
Royal Dutch Shell Plc. In June, Grupo BTG Pactual said it agreed
to buy half of Petrobras’s assets in  Angola , Benin, Gabon,
 Namibia , Nigeria and Tanzania for $1.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
