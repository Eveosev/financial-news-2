German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
eavesdropping on allies is unacceptable and that trust must be
won back following reports her mobile phone was bugged by U.S.
intelligence agencies.  “Spying among friends is not on,” Merkel said to
reporters before a European Union summit in Brussels today, her
first public reaction to yesterday’s report in Der Spiegel
magazine. “We need trust between allies and partners, and this
trust must be re-established.”  German politicians from all parties have reacted with
outrage to the report that the U.S. National Security Agency may
have been monitoring Merkel’s private mobile phone for years. A
White House denial that the U.S. is listening in failed to stem
the calls in Germany and elsewhere in Europe for action to
ensure there is no repeat.  Germany  summoned the U.S. ambassador to the Foreign
Ministry in Berlin today to clarify the charge of U.S.
eavesdropping as Merkel joined EU leaders in Brussels, where the
summit discussion of data protection took on new relevance.  “There are strong signals that my German colleague has
been wire-tapped,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told
reporters before the summit, saying that he found the charge
“impossible, unthinkable and very serious.”  A decision today on possible action against the U.S. “is
not foreseen,” he said. “We are now awaiting the investigation
results and based on that, we will set the next steps.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
