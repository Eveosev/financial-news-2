America’s Team is headed to London
next season, with the  Dallas Cowboys  playing in the National
Football League’s international series of regular-season games
for the first time.  The Jacksonville Jaguars will host the Cowboys at Wembley
Stadium as the series expands to three games in the U.K. next
year, the league said in an e-mailed statement.  The Cowboys, five-time Super Bowl champions who have long
called themselves America’s Team, are the NFL’s most popular
club with U.S. fans, while the Jaguars, winless this season, are
the least popular, according to a Harris Poll conducted last
year.  The Atlanta Falcons will host the  Detroit Lions  and the
Oakland Raiders will host the  Miami Dolphins  in the two other
games at Wembley in 2014. The dates and times of the games will
be announced at a later date  “Our fans in the U.K. continue to demonstrate their
passion for more football,” NFL commissioner  Roger Goodell 
said. “The growing enthusiasm for the NFL internationally is
exciting and we look forward to continuing to respond to this
interest in our game.”  The NFL has played seven regular season games in London
since 2007, with an average attendance of 82,443. The Minnesota
Vikings beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 34-27 this year at Wembley
in front of a crowd of 83,518.  The Jaguars (0-7) face the San Francisco 49ers (5-2) at
Wembley on Oct. 27. The team has committed to playing a home
game in London each year through 2016.  To contact the reporters on this story:
