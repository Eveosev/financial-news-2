The effect of an appreciating
currency is disappearing from  Sweden ’s inflation gauge, helping
the central bank reach its price target, Governor Stefan Ingves
said.  “The appreciation effect is sort of tapering out and that
means that, in terms of lower import prices, that disappears
gradually,” Ingves said today in an interview in Stockholm.
“That’s also one of the reasons why the inflation rate is going
to go up in the future.”  The Riksbank kept its repurchase rate at 1 percent today
and predicted inflation won’t reach its 2 percent target until
the end of 2014. That will allow the bank to start raising rates
at that time, it said.  The krona, which in June reached its weakest level against
the euro in a year, is now not a “major issue” for the
Riksbank, Ingves said. “The krona has lately been fairly stable
and we expect it to be that way.”  Sweden’s krona has appreciated 4.2 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes, which
measure a basket of 10 developed-nation currencies. That’s close
to a 4.5 percent appreciation over the same period in the Swiss
franc, according to Bloomberg data.  The krona will strengthen gradually, rising about 2 percent
against a trade-weighted basket of currencies in the three years
through November 2016, the Riksbank estimates.  The currency lost more than 30 percent against the euro
between Dec. 21, 2006, and March 5 when it weakened to a low of
11.6838. It has since strengthened more than 33 percent trading
at 8.7656 as of 1:49 p.m. in  Stockholm  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
