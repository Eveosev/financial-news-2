Treasury 10-year note yields traded
at almost a three-month low as signs of a loss of momentum in
global economic growth stoked bets the  Federal Reserve  will
delay slowing its stimulus program until next year.  U.S. government debt  was poised for a weekly gain as more
Americans than forecast filed applications for jobless benefits
last week and the  trade deficit  was little changed in August as
imports and exports stalled. Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities headed for the biggest two-month increase in more
than a year as a sale of $7 billion of 30-year TIPS drew strong
demand in the first auction since lawmakers voted to raise the
debt ceiling. The U.S. will sell $96 billion in notes next week.  “The Fed’s not going anywhere,” said Larry Milstein,
managing director in New York of government-debt trading at R.W.
Pressprich & Co. “You have a market that’s going to be capped
out in terms of rate. The economic data we’ve seen of late is
softening.”  The benchmark 10-year yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.52 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yield dropped to
2.47 percent yesterday, the lowest level since July 22, and has
fallen six basis points this week. The 2.5 percent note due in
August 2023 fell 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face value, to 99
27/32.  Demand Underpinned  Demand for Treasuries may be supported by new regulations
that would require the biggest U.S. banks to hold enough easily
sold assets to survive a 30-day credit drought under Fed
liquidity rules that expand on international standards adopted
earlier this year.  The Fed liquidity coverage ratio being considered today at
a meeting in  Washington  goes further than the Basel III measure
adopted in January and calls for earlier implementation than the
European Union. The U.S. plan, most stringent for banks with
more than $250 billion in assets or substantial international
reach, seeks implementation by 2017 -- two years ahead of
Basel’s deadline.  Treasuries returned 0.7 percent this month through
yesterday, according to the Bloomberg  U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY) ,
trimming losses this year to 1.8 percent. The Bloomberg Global
Developed  Sovereign Bond Index (BGSV)  gained 1.5 percent in October,
paring its 2013 decline to 1.9 percent.  The Treasury announced today it will sell $32 billion of
two-year notes on Oct. 28, $35 billion of five-year debt the
next day and $29 billion of seven-year securities on Oct. 30.  TIPS Auction  Today’s 30-year TIPS auction drew a  bid-to-cover  ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, of 2.76, the highest since October 2012, versus 2.48 at
the June 20 auction and an average of 2.67 at the 10 previous
auctions.  The sale drew a  yield  of 1.33 percent versus a 1.359
percent average forecast of seven of the Fed’s 21 primary
dealers in a Bloomberg News survey. The June sale yielded 1.42
percent.  Indirect bidders , a category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 45 percent of the securities, the
lowest since June 2012, after buying 60.8 percent at the June
sale and an average of 44.2 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.1 percent of
the securities, the highest since June 2012, after a record low
0.4 percent at the June sale. The average the past 10 auctions
was 16 percent.  Yield ‘Reach’  “The auction went better than expected,” said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasury trading at BNY Mellon Capital
Markets in New York. “There has definitely been a reach for
yield and a reach for the long end. There’s a desire for
inflation protection with QE in place probably for a little
longer than most people expected.”  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and TIPS, a
gauge of expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
securities, was 2.18 percentage points. The 10-year average is
2.22 percentage points.  TIPS have returned 2.3 percent in September and October,
poised for the best performance since April and May of 2012,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Demand for inflation insurance is climbing on speculation
the Fed will maintain asset purchases at the current level to
support for the economy into 2014, increasing projections for
gains in consumer prices.  Volatility Drops  Economists predict the Fed will maintain the current pace
of bond purchases until March, according to a Bloomberg survey
conducted on Oct. 17-18. The Fed today purchased $1.56 billion
in Treasuries maturing between May 2038 and February 2043 as
part of its program to lower borrowing costs and boost the
economy.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 31.4 today, rising from 25.8 yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30 or above 70
suggests the security may be poised for a change in direction.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
MOVE index dropped to 62.05 yesterday, the lowest level since
May 21. The average for the past decade is 95.06.  Jobless claims  decreased by 12,000 to 350,000 in the week
ended Oct. 19 from a revised 362,000 in the prior period, a
Labor Department report showed today in Washington. The median
forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
decrease to 340,000.  Global Growth  Applications in  California  remained elevated and analysts
weren’t able to determine how many non-federal workers filed due
to the government shutdown, a Labor Department spokesman said.  The partial government shutdown this month trimmed 0.25
percentage point from fourth-quarter economic growth and cost
the U.S. 120,000 jobs in October,  Jason Furman , head of the
 Council of Economic Advisers  and Obama’s chief economic adviser,
said this week.  Treasury  holdings  for the 21 primary dealers rose by $23.9
billion or 19.6 percent to a record $146 billion as of Oct. 16,
the day before the U.S. was expected to run out of borrowing
authority prior to the agreement reached that day to postpone
the debt ceiling through Feb. 7.  The  International Monetary Fund  this month cut its forecast
for global economic growth to 2.9 percent in 2013 and 3.6
percent in 2014, from July’s projected rates of 3.1 percent this
year and 3.8 percent next year. It also sees inflation across
rich countries already short of the 2 percent rate favored by
most central banks.  U.S. payrolls rose by 148,000 in September, less than the
forecast of 180,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. That
followed a revised increase of 193,000 in August that was larger
than initially estimated, the Labor Department said Oct. 22.  The  trade deficit  increased 0.4 percent to $38.8 billion
from a revised $38.6 billion in July that was smaller than
previously reported, the Commerce Department reported today in
Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 71
economists called for a $39.4 billion deficit.  “You have the uncertainty of economic data approaching
year end -- the market is waiting to get a clear direction on
which way the economy is going,” said  Sean Simko , who oversees
$8 billion at  SEI Investments Co. (SEIC)  in Oaks,  Pennsylvania . “There
will continue to be a bid in the marketplace; 2.40 percent is a
reasonable target for the 10-year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
