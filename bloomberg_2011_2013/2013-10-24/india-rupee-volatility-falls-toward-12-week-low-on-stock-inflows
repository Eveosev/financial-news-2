Volatility in  India ’s rupee fell
toward a 12-week low as foreign funds boosted purchases of the
nation’s stocks after the U.S. maintained its stimulus.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, declined five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 11.77 percent as of 10:02
a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rate has dropped 3.1 percentage points in eight days and touched
11.73 percent yesterday, the lowest level since July 30.  The S&P BSE  Sensex (SENSEX)  Index surpassed its record close today
after global funds bought a net $1.8 billion of shares this
month, exchange data show. The Federal Reserve will wait until
March before easing the pace of asset purchases, according to
the median estimate in an Oct. 17-18 Bloomberg survey. India’s
goal of containing its current-account shortfall at 3.7 percent
of gross domestic product in the year through March is still
more than the 2.5 percent the central bank considers sustainable.  “The drop in volatility is due to the delay in U.S.
tapering, which has boosted global liquidity and stabilized the
spot rupee a bit,” said Andy Ji, a foreign-exchange strategist
at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  in  Singapore . “The tapering
will eventually start, and when this happens the rupee will
weaken again due to the still-large current-account deficit.”  The rupee gained 0.1 percent to 61.525 per dollar in the
spot market, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has rebounded 12 percent from a record
low of 68.845 touched Aug. 28.  The Bloomberg Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major counterparts, has fallen 1.9 percent since Sept.
17, the day before the Fed decided to maintain its $85 billion
of monthly bond purchases.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 0.2 percent to
62.93 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts gained 0.3 percent to 62.93. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
