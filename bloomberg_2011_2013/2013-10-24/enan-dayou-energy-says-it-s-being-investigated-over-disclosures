Henan Dayou Energy Co. (600403) , a Chinese
state-controlled coal producer, said it’s being investigated by
the country’s securities regulator for possible disclosure
irregularities. The stock slumped.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission has opened an
investigation because of “suspected illegal disclosure of
information,” Henan Dayou said yesterday in a statement to the
 Shanghai Stock Exchange . It didn’t say which disclosures were
being probed.  No one was available to answer questions on the case,
according to a woman who refused to give her name at the
regulator’s press office in Beijing. Henan Dayou didn’t respond
immediately to an e-mail.  The probe comes after the company said in a July 29
 statement  that Wu Yulu, chairman of Yima Coal Industry Group
Co., its controlling  shareholder , was placed under
“shuanggui”, without saying why. Shuanggui is a phrase that
literally means to report at a specific time at a specific
place, which is the Communist Party’s form of extra-judicial
custody. Wu is also on the  board  of Henan Dayou, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Henan Dayou plunged 6.2 percent to 9.80  yuan  at 11:29 a.m.
in Shanghai trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
