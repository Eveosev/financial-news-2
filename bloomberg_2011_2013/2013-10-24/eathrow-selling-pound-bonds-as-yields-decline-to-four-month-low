Heathrow Airport Holdings Ltd.
issued pound-denominated bonds as borrowing costs for
investment-grade companies fell to the lowest in more than four
months in the U.K.  The owner of  Europe ’s busiest hub sold 750 million pounds
($1.2 billion) of 33-year notes yielding 117 basis points more
than U.K. government debt through its Heathrow Funding Ltd.
unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The
average yield on sterling corporate bonds fell 3 basis points to
3.53 percent, the lowest since June 17, Bloomberg bond  index 
data show.  “Supply in investment grade is shrinking and that is
supportive for yields and spreads,” said John Pattullo, who
manages the equivalent of about $4.7 billion as head of retail
credit at  Henderson Global Investors  in  London .  Non-financial companies in the U.K. issued 550 million
pounds ($891 million) of high-grade bonds so far this month
compared with 4.2 billion pounds for all of September and a
monthly average of 2 billion pounds this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s pushed the premium investors
demand to hold the securities instead of government debt down to
156 basis points, the lowest since November 2007, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  “Today’s bond issuance in the sterling market is part of
Heathrow’s regular financing activities and the proceeds from
the issue will be used to refinance existing debt,” said Andrew Efiong, Heathrow’s Director of Treasury.  Three-Part Sale  In the high-yield sterling market today, Domestic & General
Group Ltd. sold a total 500 million pounds of notes in three
parts to finance its buyout by CVC Capital Partners Ltd.,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The Bedworth, U.K.-based product warranty provider marketed
175 million pounds of floating-rate notes due 2019 yielding 500
basis points more than the London interbank offered rate, 200
million pounds of senior secured bonds due 2020 yielding 6.375
percent, and 125 million pounds of securities maturing in 2021
to yield 7.875 percent, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because they’re not authorized to speak about it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
