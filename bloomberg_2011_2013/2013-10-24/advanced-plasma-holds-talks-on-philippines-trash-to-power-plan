Advanced Plasma Power Ltd. , a U.K.
waste-to-energy developer, is in talks to build a 200 million-pound ($323 million) power station in the  Philippines  that will
use trash to generate electricity.  The company is speaking to the operator of a landfill site
about building a 60-megawatt plant fed by commercial, industrial
and household waste, said Chief Executive Officer Rolf Stein.  Clean-energy producers get premium payments for their
output in the Philippines, where utilities are required to
source a portion of their electricity from renewables. The
nation is among several target countries for Advanced Plasma in
Southeast Asia, where growing cities are straining available
electricity supply and producing larger quantities of waste.  “The power costs are very high and power infrastructure
isn’t great and there seems to be a good deal of growth and
money in the region,” Stein said by telephone.  Advanced Plasma, based in  London , is seeking to start the
engineering and design phase of the power-plant project before
the end of the year. Construction would begin in mid-2014 and be
completed before the end of next year.  The developer expects the landfill-site operator to fund
the plant, Stein said. If the project goes ahead and if Advanced
Plasma continues to see high levels of interest in  Southeast
Asia , it may establish a unit in the region, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
