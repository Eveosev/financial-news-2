Rangel Dockery and her husband
bought a waterfront house in  Florida  four months ago, assuming
their $2,000-a-year flood-insurance premium would remain about
the same. After reading recently about a change in the federal
flood program, they checked on next year’s rates and were
stunned: Their bill will grow to $14,000 annually.  Now the elementary school teacher and her husband, Clint,
an information technology specialist, are considering selling
their two-bedroom St. Pete Beach home, probably at a loss,
because she said they can’t afford the bill, and their mortgage
requires flood coverage.  “It was very frustrating to finally have what we’ve worked
hard for all of our life,” Rangel Dockery, 52, said. “I feel
like the rules were changed in the middle of the game. And
unfortunately, we can’t play by the new rules.”  Monthly premiums for more than 1 million homeowners are set
to increase due to a rewrite by the U.S. Congress last year of
the federal flood insurance program. As a result, home prices in
flood zones around the country are declining as potential buyers
balk at the premiums, said Moe Veissi, a Miami real estate agent
who led the Chicago-based National Association of Realtors last
year.  Federal flood insurance covers $1.3 trillion of property in
all 50 states, with Florida,  Texas , Louisiana, California and
New Jersey making up two-thirds of all policies, according to
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the program.  Seeking Repeal  About 85 private insurance companies contract with FEMA to
administer the flood program, including Northbrook, Illinois-based  Allstate Corp. (ALL)  and Columbus, Ohio-based Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Co.  Consumer groups, governors and mortgage bankers are calling
on Congress to reverse the law, which was designed to reduce the
National Flood Insurance Program’s growing debt. The measure,
called the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012,
phases in rate increases for the 20 percent of policyholders who
have been receiving federal subsidies on premiums.  Some of those subsidies began disappearing or shrinking on
Oct. 1, 15 months after the law passed with bipartisan support.  States are searching for ways to reduce homeowners’ bills.
In Florida, home to 37 percent of the nation’s 5.6 million flood
policies, state lawmakers are trying to attract private
companies to write flood policies and are considering starting a
state-based flood insurance pool.  ‘Appropriate’ Measure  Mississippi sued the federal government to stop the rate
increases, saying the U.S. failed to study the economic impact.
Louisiana is preparing to sue. Massachusetts Attorney General
Martha Coakley proposed legislation this month to cap the amount
of insurance lenders can require.  Bills pending in the U.S. House and Senate to delay rate
increases have bipartisan support, mostly from lawmakers in
coastal states.  Research groups that advocate market-based policies, such
as Heritage Action for America and the R Street Institute, have
urged members of Congress to leave the measure in place.  The law is an an “appropriate” way to restore financial
viability to the program, and it makes sense to ask those with
the greatest risk to pay more, said R.J. Lehmann, senior fellow
for the Washington-based R Street Institute, in a statement.
Lehmann helped write the law sponsored by Representatives Maxine Waters, a  California  Democrat, and Judy Biggert, an Illinois
Republican, who lost the November election.  Reaping ‘Heartache’  Waters, who said she never expected the bill she sponsored
to cause large rate increases, is now working to delay its
implementation.  “When I agreed to coauthor this legislation, our goal was
to create a bipartisan solution to repair our National Flood
Insurance Program,” Waters said in a Sept. 30 statement.
“Neither Democrats nor Republicans envisioned it would reap the
kind of harm and heartache that may result from this law going
into effect.”  Louisiana property assessments on homes in flood zones have
already dropped by as much as 30 percent because of the new
flood rules, said Michael Hecht, president of Greater New
Orleans, Inc., an economic development organization. Hecht’s
group has been using such stories to warn lawmakers to change
the law.  “Owners will lose everything, values of unsellable
properties will plummet, bank mortgages will go into default,
local tax bases will erode, and economies will be eviscerated,”
according to material distributed by Greater New Orleans.  Rejecting Contracts  Homebuyers are walking away from contracts when they see
the insurance costs, said Ross Miller, who owns a mortgage
brokerage in Metairie. In parts of Plaquemines Parish, a coastal
community on the Gulf of Mexico, neighborhoods will have
insurance premiums of $10,000 to $25,000 a year, Miller said.  “What do they think people are going to do?” he said.  Rangel Dockery said she and her husband moved from a 2,200-square-foot home inland to a property half its size in June,
drawn to the barrier island on Florida’s west coast.  Their son had moved out of the old house for college and 
they expect to retire in the next five to 10 years, she said.  “We absolutely love it, and it would be very difficult to
have to sell,” she said. “It’s the lifestyle we were looking
forward to.”  Rapid Increase  Dockery said they never would have bought the $400,000 home
if they knew insurance rates would increase so rapidly. The
property is assessed by Pinellas County, which includes St. Pete
Beach, at about $521,600.  Some house hunters in the area have already begun
blacklisting neighborhoods where rates are rising, said Wendy
Lockhart, a St. Petersburg, Florida, real estate agent. Lockhart
is struggling to sell her own home after quotes for the
insurance premium went from about $1,000 to $8,105.  “We were getting five or six showings a week,” she said.
“Then when all this started hitting the front pages about three
weeks ago, we’ve had no showings.”  Realtors in the St. Petersburg area, which has more than
50,000 subsidized policies, have taken up a marketing pitch for
homes that don’t lie in flood zones: “No flood insurance
required!”  Karen Hoyt, a physical therapist who is preparing to move
from  Colorado  to St. Pete Beach, said the insurance rates she’s
seen have discouraged her from buying.  “We’re going to rent for a year and see what happens,”
Hoyt said.  No Subsidy  Under the law, those who bought homes after July 2012
became ineligible for subsidies after Oct. 1.  The flood insurance program amassed more than $20 billion
in debt after Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans in 2005
and it borrowed more after superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast
in 2012.  Under the law, owners of vacation homes began to lose
federal subsidies in January, with annual rate increases of 25
percent until reaching full price. Beginning Oct. 1, subsidies
for businesses and primary homes began being phased out. Those
who buy homes in flood zones or sign up for new policies won’t
be eligible for subsidies.  Subsidies have kept rates as low as 10 percent of the
actual cost. FEMA is reassessing its risk calculations, drawing
flood maps that will bring higher rates to some areas.  If the Florida legislature finds ways to give homeowners
more options for flood insurance, that may pressure lawmakers in
 Washington  to reduce rates, said Florida State Senator David Simmons, the Republican chairman of the Banking and Insurance
committee. Florida policyholders have paid $16 billion into the
federal program over the last 35 years, while taking out about
$4.5 billion in claims, he said.  “We’re the ones who are subsidizing the entire National
Flood Insurance Program,” Simmons said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
