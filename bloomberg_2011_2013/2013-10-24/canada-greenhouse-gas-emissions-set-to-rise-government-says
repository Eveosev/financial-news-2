Canada, the world’s seventh-largest
emitter of  greenhouse gases , will increase output of carbon
dioxide through 2020, failing to meet a government pledge to
lower emissions, Environment Canada said today.  Without further measures to curb carbon output, emissions
will increase to 734 megatonnes by 2020 from 701 megatonnes in
2011, Environment Canada said today on its  website.  That would
be little changed from 2005 output, which Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  has promised to cut by 17 percent by 2020 as part of the
2009 Copenhagen Accord.  The biggest contribution will come from the oil and gas
industry, expected to boost emissions by 38 percent between 2005
and 2020, the government agency said. Federal and Alberta
government officials are working with industry to set new rules
to limit output.  “Canada is moving in the wrong direction on addressing
greenhouse gas pollution,” said P.J. Partington, a climate
policy analyst at the Pembina Institute, an environmental
consultancy and research group. “The government has promised
Canadians that pollution levels will drop, but  Environment
Canada  is forecasting that they will increase.”  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil producer by market
value,  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  and competitors are using new
technology to lower per-barrel emissions from oil sands
operations even as absolute carbon output rises. Companies
typically use mining techniques or underground steam injection
to extract the fossil fuel from beneath the muskeg and boreal
forests of northern Alberta.  To contact the reporters on this story:
