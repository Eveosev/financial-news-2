Lawmakers on Parliament’s cross-party Intelligence and Security Committee will question the
U.K.’S spy chiefs for the first time in public on Nov. 7.  Iain Lobban, the director of Britain’s listening post,
 Government Communications Headquarters , will appear alongside
Andrew Parker, director general of  MI5, the domestic security
service , and the head of  MI6, the overseas intelligence agency ,
John Sawers. It’s the first time the three will have appeared in
public together.  “The session will give an insight into the world of
intelligence, and the work the agencies do on behalf of the
U.K.,” the committee said in a  statement on its website . “It
represents a very significant step forward in terms of the
openness and transparency of the agencies.”  The session, which will be available to  view online , will
be transmitted on a short time-delay to allow the committee to
pause the broadcast if anything is said that may endanger
national security. The hearing will cover terrorist threats,
regional instability and weapons proliferation, cyber-security
and espionage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
