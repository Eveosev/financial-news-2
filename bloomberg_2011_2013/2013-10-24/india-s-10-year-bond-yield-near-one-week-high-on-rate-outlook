India ’s 10-year government bond
yield was near a one-week high as economists predicted the
central bank will increase borrowing costs for the second time
in as many months next week.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Raghuram Rajan will raise
the benchmark repurchase rate 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on
Oct. 29, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Rajan has said containing inflation is the central bank’s top
priority.  Wholesale prices  rose 6.46 percent in September, the
most in seven months, while consumer-price gains quickened to
9.84 percent, official data showed Oct. 14.  The yield on the 7.16 percent notes due May 2023 was 8.62
percent as of 10:02 a.m. in Mumbai, compared with yesterday’s
8.63 percent that was the highest since Oct. 15, according to
prices from the central bank’s trading system.  “Markets have factored in a 25 basis point increase in the
repo rate,” Harish Agarwal, a fixed-income trade at FirstRand
Ltd. in Mumbai, said by phone. “Trading will be range-bound as
there are no major events before the policy.”  Increased price pressures will prompt the RBI to raise the
benchmark rate by 50 basis points on Oct. 29, Taimur Baig,
Singapore-based director of Asia economics at Deutsche Bank AG,
wrote in an Oct. 16 report. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees the
benchmark rising to 8.5 percent by March.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 8.43 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
