FuelCell Energy Inc., (FCEL)  the biggest
publicly traded U.S. fuel-cell manufacturer, advanced the most
in five months after  Posco (005490) , its largest shareholder, began
construction on a South Korea factory that will manufacture its
power systems.  FuelCell rose 12 percent to $1.49 at the close in New York,
the most since May 24.  Posco, South Korea’s largest steelmaker, is building a
factory that’s expected to begin production in 2015 with an
initial annual capacity of 100 megawatts, Danbury, Connecticut-based FuelCell said in a statement today. Posco has licensed
FuelCell’s technology and plans to sell them throughout Asia.  FuelCell’s systems convert natural gas into electricity
through a chemical process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
