Ocean Power Technologies Inc. (OPTT) , a
U.S. developer of wave-energy plants, said it will work with
Japan’s  Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. (7003)  to bring its
marine systems to market.  The agreement gives Mitsui the right to sell OPT’s
 PowerBuoy  in countries including Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines
and Malaysia, according to a statement today from Pennington,
New Jersey-based OPT. Mitsui will get a 10-year license to make
and market PowerBuoys, and OPT will receive royalty payments.  While there are no commercial-scale wave projects yet
operating, marine energy is increasingly attracting large
industrial companies keen to gain a foothold as producers of the
technology start bringing their equipment to market. Alstom SA,
 Siemens AG (SIE)  and ABB Ltd. already have invested in the industry.  OPT has been collaborating with Mitsui since 2009. A year
ago the U.S. company won a $900,000 contract from Mitsui to
tailor its equipment for Japanese waters. The latest deal
cements its growth in Asia, while also allowing Mitsui to sell
the PowerBuoy in  South Africa , Mozambique and Namibia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
