Cricket  Australia  said revenue rose
63 percent to A$684 million ($660 million) in 2009-2012 and is
projected to reach A$1.08 billion over the next four-year cycle.  The governing body said at its annual general meeting in
 Melbourne  today that it’s on track to achieve its goal of having
cash reserves of A$70 million by 2016-17. It records revenue
over a four-year period due to annual fluctuations in income
depending on which national teams tour Australia.  The growth comes even as Australia’s Test team struggles on
the pitch, winning only one of its 10 elite matches so far in
2013. Australia will seek to avoid a fourth straight Ashes
series loss to  England  when the teams meet in a best-of-five
contest starting Nov. 21 in Brisbane.  “Financially, we’ve never been in better shape,” Cricket
Australia Chairman Wally Edwards said in a news conference
broadcast on his organization’s website. “A lot of good things
are happening and we just need to win the Ashes now and I’m sure
everyone will be laughing.”  In June, Cricket Australia sold domestic broadcasting
rights to Nine Entertainment Co. and Ten Network Holdings Ltd.
for A$590 million over the next five years. The new agreements
represented a year-on-year average increase of 118 percent on
the governing body’s previous broadcasting arrangements, Chief
Executive Officer James Sutherland said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
