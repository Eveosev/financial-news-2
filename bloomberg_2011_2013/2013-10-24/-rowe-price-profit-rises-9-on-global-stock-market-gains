  T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW) , the  money
manager  with about three-fourths of its assets in equities, said
third-quarter earnings rose 9 percent as a global stock rally
boosted the holdings it oversees for clients.  Net income increased to $267.7 million, or $1 a share, from
$245.7 million, or 94 cents, a year earlier, the Baltimore-based
company said today in a statement. Earnings beat the 97-cent
average  estimate  of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Customers pulled $7.4 billion, the second straight quarter
of net redemptions at the money manager that has posted a profit
every quarter since going public in 1986. The withdrawals were
offset by the appreciation in market values as the MSCI ACWI
Index of global stocks rose 7.4 percent in the quarter and 15
percent in the year through Sept. 30.  Withdrawals “are the most relevant metric investors will
focus on,”  Michael Kim , an analyst in  New York  with Sandler
O’Neil & Partners LP, said in an interview before results were
announced. “T. Rowe was at the top of the charts related to
organic growth, but that hasn’t been the case for the past few
quarters.”  T. Rowe Price’s results were announced before the start of
regular U.S. trading. The shares rose 20 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 34 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 20-company  index  of asset managers and custody
banks.  Assets Rise  Assets under management increased 5.4 percent in the
quarter and 13 percent from a year earlier to $647.2 billion.
The company reported record withdrawals of $8 billion in the
three months ended June 30 and has now seen net redemptions in
three of the last four quarters.  Strong performance and T. Rowe’s retirement-related
products had helped the firm attract deposits in each of the
past five years. The company gathered $17.1 billion in 2008 when
U.S. mutual funds, excluding money-market funds, lost $225
billion to withdrawals.  Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS)  said today its third-quarter net
income rose 30 percent to $32.6 million as markets boosted
assets. Clients withdrew a net $4.2 billion for the Denver-based
company’s 17th consecutive quarter of redemptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
