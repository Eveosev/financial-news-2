Japanese  stocks  fell, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index extending its biggest slump in three weeks, as the yen
held yesterday’s gains, dragging down exporters.  The Topix dropped 0.4 percent to 1,191.08 as of 9:00 a.m.
in Tokyo. It lost 1.5 percent yesterday, the biggest drop since
Oct. 2, after  China ’s money-market rates surged and the yen
jumped. The gauge had climbed for eight of the 10 previous
sessions. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 0.5 percent to
14,356.83 today. The yen traded at 97.43 per dollar today after
surging 0.8 percent yesterday.  “Japanese stocks had stretched gains recently, so it’s
natural that selling pressure would mount once they retreated,”
 Mitsushige Akino , chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset
Management Co. “The rout in stocks will continue today after
the yen’s gain and the jump in China’s short-term rates
triggered a selloff yesterday afternoon.”  Even with recent gains, the Topix added just 0.2 percent
this month through yesterday, trailing all its 23 developed-market peers, after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe decided to push
ahead with a sales-tax increase and the U.S. shut down parts of
its government. The equity gauge remains the best performer
among the markets this year.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1
percent today. The equity gauge lost 0.5 percent in New York
yesterday, falling for the first time in six days.  The Topix traded at 1.25 times book value yesterday,
compared with 2.56 for the S&P 500 and 1.79 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. The Japanese gauge’s 30-day historic  volatility  was
at 15.38 yesterday, compared with its five-year median of 19.27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
