Air Liquide SA (AI) , the French maker of
industrial gases, reported third-quarter sales that missed
analysts’ estimates as a strengthening euro offset growing
demand. It reiterated its forecast for profit growth in 2013.  Revenue fell 1 percent from a year earlier to 3.77 billion
euros ($5.2 billion), the Paris-based company said today in a
statement. The average  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of seven
analysts was 3.88 billion euros. Adjusted for natural gas and
“significant” currency impacts, sales rose 5.1 percent.  “Our performance this quarter is in line with the positive
trend observed since the beginning of the year, driven by our
healthcare activity, the dynamism in the Americas and Eastern
Europe, as well as an improvement in  Japan  and in electronics,”
Chief Executive Officer Benoit Potier said in the statement.
“Our operating performance is strong. Air Liquide is confident
in its ability to deliver another year of net profit growth in
2013.”  Potier has said he will unveil a strategy this December to
manage the challenges of Europe’s economic woes, growing
industrial capacity in  emerging markets , cheaper U.S. gas, and
rising demand for health-care services and electronic goods such
as tablets. In February, the group raised its savings target
from 2011 to 2015 by 30 percent to 1.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
