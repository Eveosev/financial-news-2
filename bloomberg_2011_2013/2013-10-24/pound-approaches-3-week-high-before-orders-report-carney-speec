U.K. government bonds declined for
the first time in three days as a report showed British business
optimism rose to the highest since 2010, damping demand for
fixed-income assets.  Benchmark  10-year gilt yields  climbed from near the lowest
level since August as a separate report showed U.K. inflation
expectations rose this month. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney holds a press conference in London today after the
central bank kept interest rates at a record-low 0.5 percent
this month and held asset purchases at 375 billion pounds ($606
billion). Carney introduced forward guidance on interest rates
in August. The pound weakened for a fifth day versus the euro.  “We may have got to the bottom of the range for gilt
yields,” said  Marc Ostwald , a strategist at Monument Securities
Ltd. in London. “The data has been reasonably firm. I don’t
think Carney will change his tune much today.”  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.63 percent at 4:49 p.m. London time
after dropping to 2.59 percent yesterday, the  lowest  since Aug.
27. The 2.25 percent bond maturing in September 2023 fell 0.295,
or 2.95 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.7.  The yield difference, or spread, investors demand to hold
10-year gilts instead of their German equivalents widened three
basis points to 86 basis points after reaching 82 basis points,
the narrowest since Aug. 28.  GDP Report  The Confederation of British Industry said its quarterly
gauge of  business optimism  climbed to 24 in the three months
through October from 7 in the same period through July. That’s
the highest level since April 2010.  U.K. inflation expectations for the year ahead rose to 3.2
percent this month from 2.5 percent in September, Citigroup Inc.
said in an e-mailed statement, citing a  YouGov Plc (YOU)  survey. The
Bank of England has a 2 percent inflation target.  A  report  tomorrow will show the U.K. economy expanded 0.8
percent in the third quarter compared with 0.7 percent in the
previous three months, according to the median of 40 analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  U.K. gilts lost 2.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries fell 1.8
percent and German securities slid 1.5 percent.  The pound dropped 0.2 percent to 85.37 pence per euro after
depreciating to 85.55 pence, the weakest since Aug. 29. Sterling
was little changed at $1.6163 after rising to $1.6257 yesterday,
the highest since Oct. 1.  Sterling gained 2.8 percent in the past three months, the
best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose 1.7
percent, while the dollar fell 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
