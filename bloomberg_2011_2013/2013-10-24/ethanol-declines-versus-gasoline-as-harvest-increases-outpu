Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded as the motor fuel surged on concern a refinery fire
will curtail supply and as the corn harvest enables companies to
boost output of the grain-based additive.  The spread increased 1.23 cents to 76.36 cents a gallon, a
day after an Energy Information Administration report showed
ethanol  output  jumped last week to the highest level in 16
months. Gasoline climbed as Citgo Petroleum Corp. had a fire at
its Lemont, Illinois, plant.  “Gasoline is an outlier today and that’s because of the
Lemont thing,” said Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk
Management in  Dallas . “It’s the Hamburger Helper effect. With
corn on the downside ethanol’s held back.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery added 2.5 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $1.826 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures are down 17 percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery rose 3.73 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.5896 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The additive is derived primarily from corn in the U.S.,
with one bushel making at least 2.75 gallons. About 39 percent
of a predicted record crop has been  harvested , according to the
U.S. Agriculture Department.  Corn for December delivery slumped 2.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $4.4025 a bushel in Chicago. The December crush
spread of corn to ethanol was 7 cents, up from 5 cents
yesterday.  Ethanol Production  Ethanol  production  jumped 3.2 percent to 897,000 barrels a
day last week, the most since June 2012, data from the Energy
Department’s analytical division show. Stockpiles expanded 0.5
percent to 15.5 million barrels, the highest since Sept. 27,
according to EIA.  The Environmental Protection Agency tracks compliance with
federal ethanol-use mandates with Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, tradable certificates that are attached to
each gallon of biofuel.  Corn-based RINs fell 2.5 cents to 24.5 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, tumbled 7 cents to 31 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The U.S. has made no  foreign purchases  of the additive
since Sept. 27, according to EIA.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.29 a gallon in the
week ended Oct. 18, the highest since June 14, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York was unchanged
at $2.15 a gallon; on the West Coast prices declined 5.5 cents
to $2.165; in the U.S. Gulf the additive lost 1.5 cents to
$2.10; and in Chicago the biofuel slid 2.5 cents to $2.02 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf narrowed 4 cents
to 6.5 cents, the tightest since Oct. 11, while Chicago’s
discount to  New York  expanded 2.5 cents to 13 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
