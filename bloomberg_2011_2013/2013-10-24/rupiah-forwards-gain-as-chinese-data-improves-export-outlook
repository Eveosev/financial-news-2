Rupiah forwards gained the most in
almost two weeks after a Chinese manufacturing gauge rose by
more-than-forecast, improving  Indonesia ’s export outlook. The
yield on 10-year bonds fell to the lowest level since July.  The preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics was
50.9 for October, compared with the 50.4 median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey and a final level of 50.2 in September.  China 
took 14 percent of Indonesia’s exports in August, official data
who. The Southeast Asian nation’s trade balance swung to its
first surplus in five months in August, after a record deficit
in July, even as overseas shipments contracted for a 17th month.  “The impact of China’s PMI should be positive as our
exports tend to be commodity oriented, with China making up a
large part of the demand,” said Tri Sulistianing Astuti, a
foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia. “The  trade
balance  will keep improving as we’re seeing exporters increase
their trade-financing activity.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards on the rupiah surged 1
percent, the most since Oct. 11, to 10,920 per dollar as of 10
a.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The offshore
contracts were 3 percent stronger than the onshore spot rate,
which gained 0.2 percent to 11,249, prices from local banks show.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 19 basis points,
or 0.19 percentage point, to 13.44 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. A  fixing  used to settle the forwards was set at
10,799 per dollar yesterday, the strongest level since Aug. 20,
according to the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  The yield on the nation’s 5.625 percent notes maturing in
May 2023 fell one basis point to 7.19 percent, the lowest level
since July 1, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show. The cost to insure Indonesia’s debt against non-payment
using five-year credit-default swaps fell two basis points
yesterday to 190, the least since June 6, according to data
provider CMA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
