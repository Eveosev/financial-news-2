ATU Auto-Teile-Unger, the German
car-repair chain owned by KKR & Co., said it agreed terms on a
debt restructuring with its biggest lenders.  Centerbridge Partners LP, ATU’s largest creditor, will
invest an extra 25 million euros ($35 million) as part of the
deal, the Weiden, Germany-based company said in a  statement  on
its website.  Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, another creditor,
supported the restructuring, according to the statement. ATU has
about 600 million euros of bonds coming due next year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The agreement marks a key milestone on our way toward a
significant reduction of our debt burden,” Hans-Norbert Topp,
ATU’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  ATU’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization totaled 61.9 million euros in the year to June
2013, compared with 103.4 million euros in the previous period,
the company  said  on Aug. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
