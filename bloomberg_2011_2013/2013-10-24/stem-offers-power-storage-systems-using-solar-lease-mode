Stem Inc. , a provider of energy-storage technology, is offering battery systems to commercial
and industrial customers with no upfront costs by adapting a
financing model that’s accelerated the installation of rooftop
solar panels.  Stem will be able to install about 15 megawatts of systems
using a $5 million investment from  Clean Feet Investors I LLC ,
the Millbrae, California-based company said today in a
statement.  The company is offering long-term financing options that
are similar to the solar leases and power-purchase agreements
widely used by companies including  SolarCity Corp. (SCTY)  and Sunrun
Inc. The battery systems let customers reduce their peak power-demand expenses and cut utility bills by 10 percent to 40
percent, said Prakesh Patel, Stem’s vice president of capital
markets and strategy.  “That’s really been one of the challenges of getting this
technology out there,” Patel said in an interview. “This is a
training-wheels approach to getting to that massive scale and
adoption that you’ve seen in the solar space.”  The  batteries  store power from the grid during non-peak
hours for use during peak periods. A typical commercial customer
will use three of Stem’s 18-kilowatt systems, a total of 54
kilowatt-hours of storage capacity, which cost about $97,000.
Most contracts will be for 10 years, and customers will have the
option to buy the systems, Patel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
