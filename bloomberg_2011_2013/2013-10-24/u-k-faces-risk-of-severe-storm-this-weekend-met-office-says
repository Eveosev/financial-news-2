The U.K. should brace for severe
storm winds this weekend that may bring down trees and damage
buildings, the  Met Office  said.  Spells of heavy rain and strong winds will affect most of
the U.K. on Oct. 26-Oct. 27 with winds of as much as 80 miles
per hour (129 kilometers per hour) lashing the southern half of
the country from the evening of Oct. 27 into Oct. 28, the
government-owned forecaster said in a  website  statement.  Weather models show the storm “is likely to develop in the
west Atlantic on Saturday,” said Eddy Carroll, chief forecaster
at the Met Office. “Then it’s likely to rapidly intensify just
west of the U.K. late on Sunday before tracking across England
and  Wales  early on Monday.”  Should winds reach 80 mph, it would be equivalent to a
Category 1 hurricane on the  Saffir-Simpson  scale, one level
above a tropical storm.  Some areas could experience their strongest winds for “a
number of years,” the Met Office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
