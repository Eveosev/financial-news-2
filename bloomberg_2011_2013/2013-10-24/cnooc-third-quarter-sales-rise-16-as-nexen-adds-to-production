Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore
oil and gas producer, posted a 16 percent increase in third-quarter sales after output was boosted by the acquisition of
Canada’s Nexen Inc.  Oil and natural gas sales were 56.1 billion  yuan  ($9.2
billion) in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with 48.4
billion yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a
statement to the  Hong Kong  stock exchange yesterday. Cnooc,
which gets almost all of its income from oil and gas production,
doesn’t report quarterly profit.  Cnooc raised its first-half output by 23 percent to 198.10
million barrels of oil equivalent after buying Nexen earlier
this year for $15.1 billion. Net oil and gas production rose 18
percent to 103.4 million barrels of oil equivalent in the third
quarter.  “Revenue was in line with expectations and production was
a strong number,” said  Neil Beveridge , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “They are definitely ahead of
plan on production.”  The stock  fell  0.9 percent to HK$15.14 in Hong Kong as of
10:14 a.m. It has declined 9.8 percent in the year to date,
compared with a 0.7 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index .  Cnooc’s capital expenditure, including Nexen, jumped 49
percent to 22.38 billion yuan. The company is on track to meet
its 2013 goal of producing 338 million to 348 million barrels of
oil equivalent, excluding Nexen, Chief Financial Officer Zhong Hua said on a conference call yesterday.  Cnooc acquired a 10 percent stake in a 35-year production
sharing contract to develop the Libra pre-salt oil discovery in
the  Santos Basin , Brazil this week. China National Petroleum
Corp., the country’s biggest oil and gas producer, also acquired
a 10 percent stake in the offshore project.  To contact the reporters on this story:
