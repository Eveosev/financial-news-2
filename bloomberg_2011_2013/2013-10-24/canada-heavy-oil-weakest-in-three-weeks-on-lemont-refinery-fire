Canadian heavy crude weakened to its
widest discount to the U.S. benchmark in almost three weeks
after an  Illinois  refinery that processes the grade curtailed
operations because of a fire.  Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Lemont, Illinois,  refinery  was
running at reduced rates after the crude unit fire late
yesterday,  Fernando Garay , a company spokesman in Houston, said
in an e-mail. Crude oil pipelines from  Alberta  to the U.S. were
also full, according to people familiar with the matter.  Western Canadian Select slid $1.50 a barrel to a $33.50
discount against West Texas Intermediate, said Calgary oil
broker Net Energy Inc. It was the widest differential for the
grade since Oct. 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fire broke out at about 7:40 p.m. local time yesterday at
the Lemont refinery, Citgo said in an e-mailed statement. The
plant normally processes 170,000 barrels of crude a day. Some
units were operating, although production was “significantly
reduced,” Garay said.  The largest oil import pipeline system to the U.S.,
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s  Mainline , apportioned five lines supplying the
U.S. Midwest and Chicago markets and eastern  Canada , according
to two people familiar with the matter. Apportionment occurs
when shippers ask to transport more oil than a line can hold and
typically indicates high supplies.  Canadian Syncrude, a light oil processed from heavy crude,
was unchanged at a $9.50 discount to WTI for December delivery,
Net Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
