Croatia ’s economy will probably
contract less than economists previously expected in 2013 as
consumption strengthens and exports are boosted by the euro
area’s recovery.  Gross domestic product will contract 0.6 percent this year
on an annual basis, according to the median estimate of ten
economists in a Bloomberg survey conducted Oct. 18-23, compared
with a July prediction of a 0.7 percent contraction. The economy
will grow 0.9 percent next year, the survey shows, down from the
economists’ earlier estimate of 1.1 percent in July.  The economy of the European Union’s newest member has
shrunk more than 10 percent since 2008 as foreign direct
investment plunged 80 percent. The Adriatic nation’s economy
will expand 0.2 percent this year, the  government  predicted last
month, trimming a previous 0.7 percent forecast.  “Domestic demand in Croatia seems to be making a gradual
recovery, supported by low inflation,”  William Jackson , a
 emerging markets  economist at  Capital Economics , said by e-mail.
The recovery will probably remain “weak and fragile, as
Croatia’s major export markets include some of the weaker euro-zone countries.”  Economists expect inflation to remain below 3 percent
through 2015.  Unemployment in September rose to 19.1 percent, according
to the statistics office in Zagreb. The European Commission
forecast a 1 percent contraction this year and mild growth in
the next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
