Ibovespa  futures  climbed as data
showing China’s manufacturing strengthened more than forecast
boosted the economic outlook for Brazil’s top trading partner.  Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3) , the biggest cosmetics maker in
Brazil, may be active after posting third-quarter earnings that
missed estimates.  Eternit SA (ETER3) , a construction-materials
manufacturer, may move after saying it plans to buy back as many
as 2 million voting shares in one year.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December climbed 0.7
percent to 54,985 at 9:18 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real declined
0.4 percent to 2.1995 per dollar. In China, the preliminary 50.9
reading for a Purchasing Managers’ Index released by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics compared with a 50.4 median
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Readings above 50
indicate expansion.  “Brazilian equities will probably follow the more
favorable outlook for  China ’s growth,” Banco Bradesco SA’s
economic team wrote in a note to clients today.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market Sept. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 15 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 2.2 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo yesterday was 6.45
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.61 billion
reais this year through Oct. 22, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
