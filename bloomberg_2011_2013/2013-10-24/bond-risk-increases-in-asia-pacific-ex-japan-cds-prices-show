The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in Asia-Pacific outside of
 Japan  rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan increased 2 basis points to 134 basis
points as of 8:18 a.m. in  Singapore , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is on track for
its highest close since Oct. 22, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 2 basis points
to 106 as of 11:47 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. The gauge is headed for its second consecutive increase
and set to pare its drop this month to 19.2 basis points,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 86
basis points as of 9:14 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The measure, which has ranged from 74 to 148.1 this
year, is poised to drop 11.3 basis points this month, CMA data
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
