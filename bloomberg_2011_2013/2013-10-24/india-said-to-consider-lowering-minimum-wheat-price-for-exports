India , the world’s second-biggest
producer of wheat, will consider lowering the minimum export
price of the grain to reduce stockpiles, according to two
government officials directly involved in the talks.  The food ministry will propose to the Cabinet tomorrow that
it reduce the base price to $260 a metric ton from $300, the
officials said, asking not to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media.  The minimum wheat price needs to be lowered to reduce the 2
million tons of wheat in state reserves, they said. China is the
largest wheat producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
