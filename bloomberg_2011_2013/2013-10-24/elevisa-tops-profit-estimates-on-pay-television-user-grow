Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the largest
Spanish-language TV producer, reported a gain in third-quarter
profit as new cable and satellite customers led revenue growth.  Operating-segment profit, which leaves out items such as
depreciation and amortization, rose 6.1 percent to 7.96 billion
pesos ($614 million), Mexico City-based Televisa said today in a
statement. Sales rose 8.1 percent to 18.8 billion pesos,
compared with the 18.6 billion-peso average of seven analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Emilio Azcarraga  is turning to pay-TV services for growth as advertising sales level off for
Televisa’s broadcast-television networks. Cable-TV subscriptions
rose by more than 58,000 to 2.46 million. Sky satellite-service
users rose by almost 233,000, in line with the 233,500 average
estimate of four analysts polled by Bloomberg.  Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto reduced  government
spending  on advertising this year, while lawmakers set new
“must-offer” rules, which require Televisa to offer its over-the-air programming to pay-TV rivals for free. Televisa reported
8.79 billion pesos in revenue from television advertising and
licensing in the third quarter, compared with an average
estimate of 8.7 billion pesos.  Third-quarter net income was 2.39 billion pesos, or 84
centavos a share, compared with 2.86 billion pesos, or 1.01
pesos, a year earlier, on higher costs for items such as taxes
and depreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
