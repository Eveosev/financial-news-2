The Markit Economics preliminary
index of U.S.  manufacturing  decreased to 51.1 in October from a
final reading of 52.8 at the end of the previous month, the
London-based group said today.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 17 economists
called for a drop to 52.5, with estimates ranging from 50 to 54.
A reading greater than 50 for the purchasing managers’ figure
corresponds to expansion.  The Markit purchasers’ measure is based on replies from 85
percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  China ’s manufacturing strengthened more than forecast this
month, a sign the recovery is gaining momentum even as leaders
struggle with surging home prices and local-government debt. The
preliminary 50.9 reading for a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compared with a 50.4 median estimate from analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  In  Europe , the pace of manufacturing was little changed.
Markit’s index of euro-area factory output  increased  to 51.3
this month from 51.1 at the end of September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
