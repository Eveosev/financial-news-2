Renaissance Capital , the Russian
investment bank controlled by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ,
hired  Bank of America Corp.  Merrill Lynch equity trader Ozlem Turgay to become head of sales in Turkey.  “If the business goes well and we can make a case, I’m
certainly very happy for her to hire people to help her,”
Benjamin Samuels, global head of equity sales at RenCap, said in
an interview in Moscow today. Turgay starts at RenCap next week
and will be based in Istanbul, he said.  The Turkish market will see six months of earnings
downgrades before stocks rebound and climb for two to three
years, said Samuels, who joined RenCap  this month  after 15 years
at Bank of America. RenCap also plans to initiate research
coverage of Greek banks this quarter after the nation was cut to
emerging-market status by  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) , he said.  RenCap named Igor Vayn as sole chief executive officer
earlier this month after John Hyman, who had shared the job,
decided to leave. The company cut back expansion into faster-growing  emerging markets  and closed sales, trading and research
operations in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Beijing and Hong Kong.  RenCap will announce a “whole series” of deals out of
 Africa , including initial public offerings, this quarter,
Samuels said without providing further details.  South Africa remains an “incredibly important” market for
RenCap and the bank has made staff additions to its team in
Johannesburg, said Samuels, who declined to provide further
details. Robert Lamprecht, a managing director at Bank of
America in  South Africa , will become of head of Africa sales at
RenCap in Johannesburg, a person with knowledge of the move said
on Oct. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
