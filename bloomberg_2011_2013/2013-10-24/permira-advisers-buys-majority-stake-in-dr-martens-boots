Permira Advisers LLP, the London-based private-equity firm that owns clothing brand  Hugo Boss ,
agreed to buy British boot maker  Dr. Martens  for 300 million
pounds ($486 million).  The buyout firm will acquire the Northampton, England-based
boot maker’s parent company, R. Griggs Group Ltd., the company
said in an e-mailed statement today. The transaction is
scheduled to be completed in January.  “Permira Funds have expertise in backing global brands,
demonstrated with Hugo Boss and Valentino,” Cheryl Potter,
partner and head of the consumer team at Permira, said in the
statement. “We are looking forward to supporting the management
team in this exciting next phase.”  Dr. Martens boots, known for their thick, air-cushioned
sole, gained popularity in the 1960s and spread to punk-music
fans and rock stars including The Who’s  Pete Townshend . The
footwear is sold in 63 countries, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
