Soybean futures rose for the third
time this week after the U.S. government reported increased
overseas demand. Wheat and corn fell.  In the week ended Oct. 3, exporters sold 929,752 metric
tons of  soybeans  for delivery before Sept. 30, more than double
a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a
report today. The top buyer was  China , the world’s biggest
consumer. Sales of soybean meal, an  animal feed , jumped to
850,141 tons, the most since before 1990, government data
showed.  “U.S. exporters just keep selling soybeans to China and
other overseas customers,”  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice
president at Chicago-based Linn Group, said in a telephone
interview. “The jump in meal sales is the big surprise and the
main driver for higher prices today.”  Soybean futures for delivery in January climbed 0.2 percent
to $13.065 a bushel at 10:23 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  Soybean-meal futures for December delivery rose 1.1 percent
to $425.90 for 2,000 pounds, after touching $427.40, the highest
since Sept. 19. A 60-pound bushel of soybeans produces about 48
pounds of animal feed.  In the 12 months that started Oct. 1, China’s  soybean 
imports may jump 16 percent to a record 69 million tons from a
year earlier, and corn shipments might more than double to 7
million tons, the USDA said Sept. 12.  Wheat futures for delivery in December slid 0.1 percent to
$7.0125 a bushel on the CBOT, heading for the first decline in
three sessions.  Corn futures for delivery in December dropped 0.7 percent
to $4.395 a bushel in Chicago. Through yesterday, the most-active contract fell 37 percent this year on USDA forecasts for
production to jump 28 percent to a record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
