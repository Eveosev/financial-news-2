104 Helderberg Castle Rd, New Scotland, NY  For sale: $179,900 The limestone ruins look ancient, like something abandoned by its residents hundreds of years ago along a misty loch in Scotland. The property, however, is not across the Atlantic but in upstate New York, most fittingly located in the town of New Scotland. The ruins are not as ancient, either. The home was built in 1935 by the reclusive  Bouck White , a potter and Socialist activist. Located on 4.5 acres, the property also includes a contemporary 2,500-square-foot home, but the ruins of an old castle, a pottery studio and various other outbuildings are the most intriguing selling points. The property is available as a short sale, and listing agent  Brian Brosen  doesn’t mince words about the type of work it requires, saying the buyer will need to be someone “with a vision and sense of adventure.” Related items from  Zillow Blog : Erika Riggs ,  a real estate writer for Zillow Blog, covers celebrity real estate, unusual properties and home design trends.
