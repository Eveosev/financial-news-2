Timken Co. (TKR) , which last month agreed
to spin off its steel unit amid pressure from investor Ralph Whitworth, fell the most in 15 months after cutting its full-year profit and sales forecasts.  The ball bearing-maker’s shares  slumped  11 percent to
$53.76 at 1:44 p.m. in New York after dropping to $52.75, the
biggest intraday decline since July 26, 2012.  Chief Executive Officer James Griffith cited slower-than-expected global economic growth for the revised outlook and said
third-quarter results were below the company’s forecasts,
according to a statement today.  “The shortfall was significant,”  Eli Lustgarten , an
analyst at Longbow Securities in Independence,  Ohio , said today
in an interview. “They were overly optimistic in the way the
company was expected to perform” given the stagnant demand in
heavy manufacturing, he said.  Lustgarten has a buy rating on the shares.  Adjusted earnings per share this year will be $2.90 to
$3.10, reduced from a previous range of $3.45 to $3.75. Analysts
projected $3.62, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Third-quarter adjusted profit of 56 cents a share trailed the
88-cent average of 10 analysts’  estimates .  Sales this year will decline 13 percent, deeper than a
prior outlook of a 10 percent drop, the Canton, Ohio-based
company said.  Last month, Timken jumped to its highest price ever after
agreeing to spin off its steel unit, dropping opposition to a
plan pushed by Whitworth’s Relational Investors LLC. Griffith
will step down as CEO once the division is split from the larger
bearings and transmission business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
