Cap SA (CAP) , Chile’s largest producer of
iron-ore, sank after  Grupo Security SA (SECUR)  recommended selling the
stock, forecasting lower demand for the steel-making ingredient
in  China  and a decline in prices.  Cap dropped 2.2 percent to 10,775 pesos at the close of
trading in Santiago. It was the worst performance among the 21
members of the  MSCI Chile index , which retreated 0.6 percent.  Grupo Security restarted coverage of Cap with an
“underweight” recommendation and set an 18-month target price
of 11,000 pesos. The financial services company said growth in
steel production in China will probably slow to 4 percent in
2015 from an average 15 percent annually over the past decade.
The slowdown will come while iron-ore prices fall as new mines
open, analyst Luis Felipe Galleguillos wrote in a note to
clients.  “Lower iron-ore prices and higher costs will have an
effect on Cap’s operating margins,” he wrote. Expansions at
Cap’s iron mines will produce the material at a higher average
cost than its current sites because of steeper energy costs,
according to Galleguillos.  Cap has fallen 33 percent in 2013, the worst performance
among members of the MSCI  Chile  index after fertilizer producer
Soc. Quimica y Minera de Chile SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
