  AMP Ltd. (AMP) ,  Australia ’s largest life
insurer and pension manager, expects fourth-quarter operating
earnings to fall by as much as A$65 million ($62.5 million)
after higher-than-expected policy lapses.  AMP plans to raise loss assumptions for income-protection
policy lapses to A$40 million to A$50 million and will increase
insurance reserves resulting in an expected loss of A$15
million, the Sydney-based company said in a statement today.
It’s lifting such provisions after lapses climbed to their
highest level in a decade in February.  “AMP regards improving the performance of the Wealth
Protection business as one of its highest priorities and
continues to implement short- and medium-term actions to improve
claims and lapse experience,” it said in today’s statement.  The company’s first-half underlying profit dropped by 10
percent due to increasing non-renewals, it said in August.  AMP, which has a dividend policy of 70-80 percent, will
decide on the second-half payout in February. The assumption of
policy losses was a non-cash item and wouldn’t reduce overall
capital, it said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
