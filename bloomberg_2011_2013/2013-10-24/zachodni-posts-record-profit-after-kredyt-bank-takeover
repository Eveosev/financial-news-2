Bank Zachodni WBK SA, Poland’s
third-largest lender and a unit of  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  posted a
record quarterly profit as revenue increased after a takeover of
domestic competitor Kredyt Bank SA.  Net income rose 61 percent to 537.4 million zloty ($178
million) in the three months ended Sept. 30, the bank said in a
regulatory statement today. That beat the 388 million-zloty mean
 estimate  of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Its shares
jumped as much as 4.8 percent to a record 391 zloty and were 3.5
percent higher at 386.15 zloty at 9:48 a.m. in Warsaw.  Zachodni, which completed a merger with Kredyt in January
to become the country’s biggest bank after state-controlled PKO
Bank Polski SA and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s Bank Pekao SA, is benefiting
from continued demand for retail loans in the European Union’s
largest eastern economy. The bank expects its 2013 profit to
exceed 1.43 billion zloty posted in 2012, Chief Executive
Officer Mateusz Morawiecki said in April.  “That’s one of the best set of earnings posted by a Polish
company for a long time as the bank seems to have seen the
positive impact of post-merger cost synergies earlier than
planned,” Marcin Jablczynski, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in
Warsaw, said by phone. “If the trends continue, the market may
need to increase its profit outlook for next year.”  Third-quarter net interest income, the difference between
what the bank pays on deposits and what it charges for loans,
soared 49 percent to 864.3 million zloty from 580.5 million
zloty a year earlier. Fee income rose 28 percent to 445.2
million zloty.  Bad loan provisions rose to 159.2 million zloty from 120.5
million zloty a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
