ING Groep NV (INGA)  said banks increased
the  share  offering of its U.S. insurance unit by about $146
million (106 million euros) as the Dutch company winds down its
ownership to comply with terms of a 2008 bailout.  Underwriters agreed to purchase an additional 4.95 million
shares of ING U.S. Inc. at $29.50 each, according to a statement
late yesterday from the New York-based business. ING Groep said
Oct. 23 that it had sold 33 million shares at the same price.
The transactions will reduce the Amsterdam-based company’s
ownership to 57 percent and generate proceeds of $1.1 billion.  ING U.S., which will be renamed Voya Financial, has  rallied 
56 percent from its initial offering price in May, outpacing
gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Life & Health Insurance
Index. The business offers  life insurance , savings products and
annuities, and had about 13 million customers and 7,000
employees as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing.  “This is a turnaround story that will generally succeed as
the company executes its improved strategy and pursues numerous
operational improvements,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts
wrote in a note to clients on Oct. 20. “However, we don’t see
material upside to our current price target” of $34.  ING Groep agreed with European regulators to divest at
least 25 percent of the U.S. unit by the end of 2013, more than
half by the end of 2014 and the rest by the end of 2016. It has
until the end of 2018 to complete the sale of its global
insurance operations.  ING U.S. climbed 3 percent yesterday to $30.50 in  New York .
The KBW analysts said the prospect of additional share sales
could limit gains in the stock.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  led the latest share sale, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
