Good Energy Group Plc (GOOD) , a U.K.
renewable-power supplier, closed subscriptions for a bond sale
after demand exceeded its 15 million-pound ($24 million) limit.  The subscription period for the 7.25 percent-coupon
corporate bonds ended almost three weeks before the planned Nov.
13 deadline, the Chippenham, England-based company said today in
a statement. Unsuccessful applicants will be contacted and their
subscription payments reimbursed, it said.  Good Energy had sought a minimum of 5 million pounds to
help expand its electricity-generating capacity more than 10-fold. Customers who bought the four-year bonds were offered an
extra payment on maturity valued at 0.25 percent for each year
that they’re clients and bondholders.  The company’s shares rose by as much as 6.4 percent in
 London , the most in a week, and were up 4.6 percent at 195 pence
as of 3:50 p.m. local time.  Good Energy is seeking to develop enough renewable
generating capacity to supply 50 percent of its customers’
electricity by 2016. It currently operates a single 9.2-megawatt
wind farm, which provides 16 percent of supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
