Morgan Stanley (MS)  won a bid to dismiss
a lawsuit by  Singapore ’s Hong Leong Finance Ltd. over claims the
New York-based bank deceptively sold notes designed to fail.  U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in  Manhattan  yesterday
threw out Hong Leong’s claim, ruling there wasn’t sufficient
connection between Morgan Stanley’s conduct in the U.S. and the
allegedly infringing activities in Singapore.  Hong Leong Finance had accused Morgan Stanley of persuading
it to sell so-called Pinnacle notes to its middle and working-class Singaporean customers by emphasizing they were
“conservative” and “low-risk products.” The Singapore firm
sold $72.4 million worth of the notes, which later failed.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore ordered Hong Leong
Finance to repay more than $32 million to the investors, as of
March, the judge wrote.  Harriet Ngan, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at Morgan
Stanley, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for
comment on the ruling. Louisa Cheong, a spokeswoman at Hong
Leong Finance, also didn’t immediately respond.  Furman ruled last week that Morgan Stanley must face a
separate lawsuit by a group of Singapore plaintiffs, who claimed
they lost $154.7 million in a “bait and switch” scheme on
another group of Pinnacle notes designed to benefit Morgan
Stanley at the expense of the customers.  The case is  Hong Leong Finance Ltd. (HLF)  v. Pinnacle Performance
Ltd., 12-cv-6010, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
