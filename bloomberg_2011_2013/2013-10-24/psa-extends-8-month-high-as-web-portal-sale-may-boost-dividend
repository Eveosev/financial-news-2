Telekomunikacja Polska SA, Poland’s
largest phone company, extended a rally to an eight-month high
after the sale of its Internet portal fueled speculation the
company will increase its dividend next year.  The shares  rose as much as 2.1 percent and traded 1.8
percent higher at 9.6 zloty as of 2:01 p.m. in Warsaw, the
highest since Feb. 11. The stock has gained 9.1 percent since
TPSA, as the unit of  France ’s  Orange SA (ORA)  is known, raised its
cash flow target for 2013 and reported earnings that exceeded
analysts’ estimates on Oct. 22.  TPSA agreed to sell Wirtualna Polska SA, Poland’s second-biggest Web portal, for 375 million zloty ($124 million) to O2
sp. z o.o. The transaction will be completed next year and
increase TPSA’s pretax profit by about 180 million zloty, the
Warsaw-based operator said in a regulatory filing yesterday.  “The transaction increases the chances for a slightly
higher dividend in 2014,” Wlodzimierz Giller, a Warsaw-based
analyst at PKO Bank Polski SA, said in a note. Giller had
expected a sale price of as much as 300 million zloty.  Slumping mobile phone rates, fierce competition and
economic downturn hurt TPSA earnings and prompted management to
cut the 2012 dividend 67 percent to 0.5 zloty a share. TPSA
shares have still slumped 22 percent this year, becoming the
third-worst performing stock in Warsaw’s benchmark WIG30 Index.  Spectrum Auction  The proceeds from the sale will help TPSA finance a
purchase of spectrum for high-speed mobile Internet that  Poland 
will auction this or next year. The operator expects to spend as
much as 2 billion zloty on new frequencies, Chief Financial
Officer Jacques de Galzain said on a conference call this week.  “We take this news as positive as not only will the deal
provide cash for TPSA around the time it is to acquire 4G
spectrum, but the company has also managed to secure a 17
percent premium to the market’s expectations,” Tibor Bokor and
Ondrej Cabejsek, analysts at Wood & Co., said in a note today.  Wirtualna, set up in 1995 as Poland’s first Internet
portal, had 13.1 million users in July, according to Polish
Internet research company Megapanel PBI/Gemius. Its biggest
competitor Onet.pl, in which Ringier Axel Springer Media AG
bought a 75 percent stake for 956.3 million zloty last year, had
14.4 million users.  Wirtualna  had sales of about 175 million zloty in 2012 and
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
of “a bit more” than 40 million zloty, Galzain said this week.
Onet’s sales were 185.6 million zloty and Ebitda stood at 76.8
million zloty in the first 10 months of 2012, the last time its
earnings were published.  O2, which is being taken over by Warsaw-based private
equity fund Innova Capital, owns Poland’s largest celebrity
gossip website Pudelek.pl and runs an o2.pl portal, which in
July had 9.36 million users and was ranked fifth by  Megapanel .  Innova will help O2 finance the acquisition of Wirtualna
and plans to merge both portals, Innova said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
