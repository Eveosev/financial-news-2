Uncertainty about an independent
 Scotland ’s status in the European Union and what currency it
would use mean the prospects for Scottish financial services
lack clarity, according to a report published today.  Both developments would have a “significant” impact on
the provision of financial services, particularly on the funding
of cross-border occupational pensions, the London-based
 Institute and Faculty of Actuaries  said.  The paper outlined arguments for and against proposals put
forward by the Scottish government in relation to state pensions
as well as the advantages and disadvantages of adopting common
rules in terms of regulation, pension protection, insurance
product customer protection and pension auto-enrolment.  Independence is the flagship policy of Scottish First
Minister  Alex Salmond  and his  Scottish National Party , which
runs the semi-autonomous government in Edinburgh. A referendum
will be held next year on Sept. 18. Polls show the pro-independence campaign lagging about 20 percentage points behind
those in favor of remaining part of the U.K.  The Scottish government said last month that it wanted to
re-examine plans to accelerate raising the state pension age to
67 because of Scotland’s lower life expectancy than the U.K.
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
