Federal Reserve Governor  Daniel Tarullo  warned of persistent risks in wholesale funding markets
while saying a rule proposed by the Fed requiring banks to hold
minimum liquidity levels will help prevent fire sales of assets.  The proposed liquidity coverage ratio released by  the Fed 
today is designed to mitigate “destabilizing dynamics by
helping to ensure that major banking firms have a pool of high-quality liquid assets with which to address potential short-term
net cash outflows,” Tarullo said in a statement.  During the 2008 financial crisis, short-term funding
markets dried up for securitized mortgage pools, forcing banks
to bring them back on their balance sheets. As mortgage defaults
rose, even some banks and financial institutions had difficulty
finding adequate financing for their assets.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ended up extending the
federal safety net by offering temporary guarantees of newly
issued senior unsecured debt issued by banks and thrifts to help
them secure a stable source of funds.  Risks persist from non-deposit funding of assets in
wholesale bank markets, and are among the “highest remaining
priorities” of regulators, Tarullo said.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a statement that
today’s proposal would for the first time in the U.S. “put in
place a quantitative liquidity requirement that would foster a
more resilient and safer financial system in conjunction with
other reforms.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
