Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) ,  Kazakhstan ’s biggest
copper producer, rose the most in more than two months in  London 
trading after its copper output beat analyst estimates.  Kazakhmys jumped as much as 6.2 percent to 267 pence, the
largest gain since Aug. 12, and was at 263.4 pence at 10:21 a.m.
The company produced 70,600 metric tons of copper cathode, the
finished form of the metal, in the third quarter and 214,900
tons in the first nine months, it said in a statement today.  The quarterly volume is higher than “our estimate of
64,200 tons, reflecting a higher-than-expected average mined
grade,” Fawzi Hanano, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
London, said in a report. Kazakhmys said it’s heading for the
higher end of its full-year target of 285,000 tons to 295,000
tons. “We believe the company is on track to slightly exceed
this guidance, given the third quarter beat,” Hanano said.  The average copper grade in the ore extracted by Kazakhmys
rose to 1 percent in the third quarter from 0.9 percent a year
earlier, it said in the statement. London-based Kazakhmys is
seeking to reduce production costs to counter declining metal
prices, which are capping profits in the  mining industry . Copper
prices have declined 9.5 percent this year.  Kazakhmys is set to increase copper output in the final
quarter because it hasn’t processed all the ore extracted in the
previous three months, John Smelt, a spokesman, said in a phone
interview. Copper concentrate production was 78,700 tons in the
third quarter while copper cathode output was 70,600 tons.  ‘Typically Solid’  “Typically solid production report from Kazakhmys,” Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. in London, said in a
note today. “We do see upside to our numbers and scope to
upgrade if efforts to boost grade profile and reduce higher-cost
production are successful.”  Investec Plc (INVP)  upgraded Kazakhmys’s rating to hold from sell.  Kazakhmys, which is targeting 500,000 tons of copper output
a year by 2017 by building the Bozshakol and Aktogay mines, had
net debt of $1.4 billion at the end of September. The company is
set to receive $875 million in cash and about 77 million of its
own shares from the sale of its 26 percent stake in Eurasian
Natural Resources Corp.  ENRC founders  Alexander Machkevitch , Patokh Chodiev and
Alijan Ibragimov, along with the Kazakh government, gained
acceptance from 96.23 percent of shareholders as of Oct. 4 to
their offer of $2.65 in cash and 0.23 of a Kazakhmys share for
each one in ENRC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
