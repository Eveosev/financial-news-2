Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  must pay
$3 million in a lawsuit claiming a defect in a Camry caused the
vehicle to suddenly accelerate, leading to an accident that left
one woman dead and another injured, an  Oklahoma  jury said.  The jury awarded $1.5 million for each claim and will
consider punitive damages tomorrow, plaintiffs’ attorney Graham
Esdale said in an e-mailed message.  “Per the court’s instructions, we cannot comment on the
ruling pending the ongoing deliberations by the jury,” Carly Schaffner, a Toyota spokeswoman, said in a statement after the
initial verdict.  The 2005 Camry driven by Jean Bookout, then 76, sped out of
control as she was exiting from an Oklahoma highway in September
2007, according to her lawyer, Jere L. Beasley. Bookout couldn’t
stop the car and it crashed, injuring her and killing her
passenger and friend, Barbara Schwarz, 70, he said.  Toyota denied there were any defects in Bookout’s Camry.
The  Oklahoma City  state court jury today rejected Toyota’s
defense.  The lawsuit is one of several hundred claims filed against
Toyota in state and federal courts in the U.S. contending that
the company’s vehicles can inadvertently accelerate. The Bookout
case is the first test of a claim that a flaw in the vehicles’
electronic throttle-control system is at fault.  The case is Bookout v. Toyota Motor Corp., CJ-2008-7969,
District Court, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma (Oklahoma City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
