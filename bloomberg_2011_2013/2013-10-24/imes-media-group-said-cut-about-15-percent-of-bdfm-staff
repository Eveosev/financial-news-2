Times Media Group Ltd. (TMG)  will cut as
many as 25 positions at a unit that publishes South  Africa ’s
Business Day newspaper and Financial Mail magazine, according to
two people with knowledge of an internal company announcement.  BDFM Publishers Ltd. has accepted 11 voluntary severances
and will cut a further up to 14 jobs as early as next week, said
the people, who asked not to be named as the announcement hasn’t
been made public. A copy of the internal announcement confirmed
the numbers.  Editor-in-chief Peter Bruce is cutting staff as he seeks to
reduce the unit’s costs by about 15 million rand ($1.54 million)
a year, he said in an Oct. 14 interview. The unit has about 150
staff, according to Bruce. He didn’t answer calls to his mobile
phone today.  The company has been selling assets and is focusing on its
Internet news site and television business while seeking growth
opportunities in west and southern Africa. The Johannesburg-based publisher bought the 50 percent of BDFM it didn’t already
own from Financial Times-owner  Pearson Plc (PSON)  in April.  “We will be a website with a newspaper, even though the
newspaper may attract more revenue,” Bruce said in the internal
announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
