Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Roger Altman, jumped the most in a year after reporting third-quarter profit that more than doubled.  Evercore rose 7.5 percent to $53.31 at 9:37 a.m. in New
York, the second-best  performer  in the Standard & Poor’s
SmallCap Financials Index, which advanced 0.1 percent. Shares of
New York-based Evercore have climbed 64 percent this year
through yesterday, outpacing the 24 percent gain of the 116-company index.  Evercore, run by Chief Executive Officer Ralph Schlosstein,
said yesterday third-quarter net income climbed to $14 million
from $5.3 million a year earlier. Earnings excluding certain
items were 53 cents a share, surpassing the 43-cent  average
estimate  of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Schlosstein
said the firm is gaining market share as productivity per
partner increases.  “This is a strong year for the firm,” Altman said
yesterday on a call following the results. “When it’s over, it
will have been a strong year for the firm and we’re very pleased
with the firm’s progress on investment banking and as a whole.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
