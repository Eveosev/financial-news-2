Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL)  rose to
its highest price since March 2011 after the world’s second-largest cruise operator posted quarterly profit that beat
analysts’ estimates and raised its forecast for the year.  Royal Caribbean  gained  6.2 percent to $42.22 at 12:45 p.m.
in New York after earlier reaching $42.45. The Miami-based
company had advanced 17 percent this year through yesterday.  The company said its revenue yield outlook, an industry
measure of capacity and pricing, has improved for the full year
and will likely do so in 2014, according to a statement today.
Royal Caribbean also cited lower fuel prices and favorable
currency exchange rates for the revised earnings forecast.  “Investors will view RCL’s higher guidance and commentary
on 2014 yields very favorably resulting in strong price
performance in RCL shares today,” Timothy Conder, an analyst at
Wells Fargo Securities, said in a note today. He has an
outperform rating on the stock.  Full-year adjusted earnings per share will be $2.30 to
$2.35, up from a prior range of $2.20 to $2.30. Analysts
projected $2.28, on average.  Third-quarter profit of $1.71 a share, excluding items,
beat the $1.64 average estimate of analysts. Revenue increased
3.8 percent to $2.31 billion, exceeding projections of $2.29
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
