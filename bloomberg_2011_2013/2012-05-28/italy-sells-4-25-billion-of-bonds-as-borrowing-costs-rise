Italy sold 4.25 billion euros of
bonds, the maximum amount for the auction, and its borrowing
costs rose as European leaders remained divided over how to stop
contagion from the debt crisis.  The Treasury sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.4 billion) of the
zero-coupon 2014 debt to yield 4.037 percent, up from 3.355
percent at the previous auction on April 24. Investors bid for
1.66 times the amount offered, down from 1.80 times last month.
The Rome-based Treasury also sold 750 million euros of
inflation-linked bonds due in 2016 and 2017 to yield 4.39
percent and 4.6 percent, respectively.  Italy’s 10-year bond remained lower after the auction, with
the yield rising 3 basis points to 5.7 percent at 11:30 a.m.
Rome time, pushing the difference or spread with similar-
maturing German debt to 433 basis points.  European leaders at a summit last week remained divided on
solutions to the debt crisis, with German  Chancellor Angela
Merkel  resisting calls for jointly issuing bonds to lower
borrowing costs for the so-called peripheral countries. Italian
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said most European Union leaders
backed the idea the euro bonds. Italy can help coax  Germany  to
act for  Europe ’s “common good,” Monti told Italian television
station La7 in an interview on May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
