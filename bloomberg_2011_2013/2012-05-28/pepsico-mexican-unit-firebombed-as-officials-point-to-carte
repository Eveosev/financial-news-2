A leader of a Mexican drug cartel was
among four people detained for allegedly firebombing facilities
owned by  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  in one of the worst attacks on a
multinational company in the violence-ravaged nation.  Gunmen torched five warehouses and several delivery trucks
owned by Pepsico’s Sabritas potato chip unit over the weekend in
the western states of Michoacan and Guanajuato. A leader of the
Knights Templar, a spinoff of the La Familia cartel, was among
those captured, Guanajuato’s attorney general, Carlos Zamarripa,
said on his Twitter account.  Over 47,000 people have been killed since Mexico began a
pitched battle against drug cartels when President  Felipe Calderon  took office in December 2006. Michoacan Governor Fausto
Vallejo said it was the worst attack against a multinational in
Mexico and that such incidents scare away investment in his
state, Milenio TV reported.  The firebombing “caused damage to the warehouses, delivery
vehicles and products that have yet to be quantified,” Sabritas
said in its statement. “There were no injuries or lives lost.
All of our vehicles and buildings are completely dedicated to
delivering our product to our clients and consumers.”  Authorities are investigating the motive for the attack and
did not offer any immediate explanation about why Sabritas had
been targeted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
