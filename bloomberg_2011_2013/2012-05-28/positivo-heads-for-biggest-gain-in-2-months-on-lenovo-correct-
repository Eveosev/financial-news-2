Positivo Informatica SA (POSI3) , Brazil’s
biggest computer maker, rose the most in a month after a report
that  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  is seeking acquisitions in Brazil and may
set up a production facility in the country.  Positivo’s shares gained 4.5 percent to 5.81 reais, the
most since April 18, while the benchmark Bovespa index climbed
1.4 percent.  Lenovo, based in Morrisville, North Carolina, may set up a
production facility in Brazil to avoid import tariffs, Milko Van Duijl, the company’s president of Asia and  Latin America , said
in an interview with the Wall Street Journal today.  “When a computer maker mentions intentions of coming to
Brazil, Positivo’s shares rise, because it is the only relevant
player in this market,” Marcelo Varejao, an analyst at Socopa
Corretora, said by the phone from  Sao Paulo .  Lenovo’s press office in Brazil didn’t respond to an
interview request. The company is the world’s second-biggest
maker of personal computers.  “We are interested in buying or working with all the
players [in Brazil], though we are not singling out any one of
them,” when it comes to acquisitions, Van Duijl said.  Positivo has gained 0.5 percent this year, while the
Bovespa fell 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
