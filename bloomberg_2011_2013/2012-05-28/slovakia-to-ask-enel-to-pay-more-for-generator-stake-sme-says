The Slovak government will ask  Enel
SpA (ENEL)  to pay more for the majority stake in Slovenske Elektrarne
AS, which the Italian utility bought in 2006,  Sme  reported,
citing Economy Minister Tomas Malatinsky.  Enel paid 839 million euros for the 66 percent holding in
 Slovakia â€™s largest electricity generator, the newspaper said.
The government may ask for about 200 million euros more because
of excessive reserves created by Slovenske before the sale, Sme
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
