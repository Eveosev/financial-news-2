Egypt  agreed to export 867 metric
tons of cotton in the week through May 24, the Alexandria Cotton
Exporters Association said today in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 74,583 tons of cotton, valued at
$234.2 million, since the marketing year began Sept. 1. Of last
week’s agreed sales, 221 tons were of the Giza 88 variety, while
Giza 86 accounted for 639 tons, Giza 87 for 4 tons and 3 tons of
Giza 77xs6 were sold, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India 
are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
