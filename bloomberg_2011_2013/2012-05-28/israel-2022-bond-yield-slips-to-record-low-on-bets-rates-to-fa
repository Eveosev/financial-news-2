Israeli  government bonds  rose,
pushing yields to the lowest level since the notes were issued,
on investor bets the Bank of Israel will reduce the base lending
rate in coming months to support economic growth.  The yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark notes due January
2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point to 4.44
percent, at 11:30 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  Two-year  interest-rate
swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates over the
period, which were unchanged at 2.37 percent, dropped 41 basis
points this month.  “It is a tough call this month as there is more downside
risk from the global economic environment,” said  Jonathan Katz ,
a Jerusalem-based economist for HSBC Holdings Plc. “The central
bank may save its ammunition this time to see how  Europe ’s debt
crisis develops and start lowering borrowing costs in the next
two months, which is pushing yields lower.”  Economic growth in Israel will slow to 3.1 percent this
year from 4.8 percent in 2011, central bank forecasts show. The
central bank’s monetary policy committee, led by Governor
 Stanley Fischer , will hold the rate at 2.5 percent for a fourth
consecutive month, according to 22 out of 24 economists  surveyed 
by Bloomberg News. Two predicted a quarter-point cut. The bank
will announce its decision at 5:30 p.m. today.  The country could be affected by a deterioration of
Europe’s debt crisis amid concern Greece may leave the economic
union which accounts for about 35 percent of Israeli exports.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, increased three basis points to 244. That
implies an average annual inflation rate of 2.44 percent over
the period.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, rose 0.2 percent to 264.33. The
shekel gained 0.1 percent to 3.8527 a dollar, trimming this
month’s loss to 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
