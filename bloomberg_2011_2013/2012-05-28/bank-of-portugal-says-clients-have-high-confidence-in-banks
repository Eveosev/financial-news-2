Bank of  Portugal  Governor Carlos Costa said customers in the country have “high” confidence in
financial institutions and in the financial system.  There has been “high” growth in  bank deposits  by
individuals, Costa said in a report released today about banking
supervision.  “The fragility of the internal economic situation,
characterized by a high level of  unemployment , raises important
risks for the balances of families and companies, and requires
growing attention from the Bank of Portugal,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
