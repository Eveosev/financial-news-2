Mexico ’s peso climbed for the first
time in five days as concern eased that  Greece  will leave the
euro, buoying demand for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The peso climbed 0.6 percent to 13.9498 per  U.S. dollar  at
4 p.m. in Mexico City. All 16 major currencies climbed on the
day against the dollar.  Greek opinion polls showed growing support for parties
backing a bailout plan. Greece’s New Democracy placed first in
all six opinion polls published on May 26 as campaigning
continued for the general election on June 17.  “Any news that’s not bad regarding Greece helps the
market,” said Miguel Blando, a currency trader at Intercam Casa
de Bolsa SA in Mexico City. “It gives you a bit of an excuse to
not be so negative on the peso because the Mexican fundamentals
are still good.”  Crude for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to $91.14 a barrel
in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
State-owned  Petroleos Mexicanos  is the world’s third-biggest oil
producer.  “Higher petroleum prices imply a greater flow of dollars
into the country and that has to help you,” said Erick
Urtuzuastegui, an economist at Prognosis, a provider of economic
research to Mexican banks and brokerages.  Yields on Mexico’s benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.23 percent.
The price of the securities rose 0.3 centavo to 132.71 centavos
per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
