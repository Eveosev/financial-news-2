The euro extended yesterday’s advance
against the dollar amid speculation that  China  will take more
steps to boost economic growth, fueling demand for higher-
yielding assets.  The 17-nation euro appreciated from within 0.2 percent of
its lowest level since July 2010 after polls showed Greece’s
pro-bailout parties gaining ground, damping concern the nation
will exit the currency bloc. The Australian dollar strengthened
against most of its 16 major peers tracked by Bloomberg.  “There’s enough there to check the down-leg in euro-
dollar,” said  Paul Robson , a senior foreign-exchange strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. There’s “a
slightly more risk-positive take in the market with the
Australian dollar rising and we’ve had news about possible
fiscal stimulus out of China as well,” he said. Easing concern
 Greece  may exit the currency bloc “probably reduces some of the
tail risks for the euro,” he said.  The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.2556 at 10:25 a.m. London
time. It slid to $1.2496 on May 25, the lowest since July 6,
2010, and has lost 5.2 percent this month. The common European
currency added 0.2 percent to 99.83 yen. The yen was little
changed at 79.51 per dollar.  The Australian dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to 98.69
U.S. cents. It advanced most against the South Korean won and
Japanese yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
