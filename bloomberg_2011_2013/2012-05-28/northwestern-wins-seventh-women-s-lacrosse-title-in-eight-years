Northwestern University  won its
seventh women’s college lacrosse championship in eight years
with an 8-6 victory over Syracuse University.  Taylor Thornton and Erin Fitzgerald scored goals for
Northwestern to snap a 6-6 tie and the Wildcats held Syracuse
scoreless for the final 11 minutes of the second half yesterday
in Stony Brook,  New York .  Shannon Smith finished with two goals and two assists for
Northwestern (21-2), which captured its second straight title
after winning five in a row from 2005-2009. The Wildcats lost to
the University of Maryland in the 2010 championship game.  Maryland will play for the men’s lacrosse title today, when
the unseeded Terrapins face top-ranked Loyola University of
Maryland. Loyola defeated Notre Dame 7-5 and Maryland upset
third-seeded Duke 16-10 in their National Collegiate Athletic
Association semifinals to reach the final at Gillette Stadium in
Foxborough,  Massachusetts .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
