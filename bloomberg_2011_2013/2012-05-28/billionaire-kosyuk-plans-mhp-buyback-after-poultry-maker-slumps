The founder of  Mironovskiy
Hleboproduct SA (MHPC) , Ukraine’s biggest poultry producer, is
considering buying back shares after the stock slumped 44
percent over the last four years.  “Should the stock price continue to decline, I will buy
back shares,” Yuriy Kosyuk, the billionaire chief executive
officer who founded the company known as MHP in 1998, said in an
interview in his Kiev office on May 24. “There are resources to
buy back shares.”  Kosyuk, 44, sold a 19.4 percent stake at $15 a share in an
initial public offering in 2008, raising $322.5 million. The
stock closed at $11.15 in London trading on May 25, sliding from
a record closing high of $19.8 in June 2008.  Ukraine’s  benchmark stock index  has plunged 27 percent this
year on concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will cut demand
for the country’s commodities such as steel and chemical
products. The economy is set to slow to 1.6 percent this year
from 5.2 percent in 2011, Fitch Rating said on May 11.  MHP’s first-quarter profit more than doubled to $48 million
from a year earlier on higher chicken prices and growing
exports, the company said on May 17. Full-year net income jumped
20 percent to $259 million in 2011 as revenue climbed 30 percent
to $1.23 billion. Volumes rose 12 percent to 370,900 tons as the
company boosted sales to  Libya , Lebanon, Uzbekistan and  Angola .  Higher Profit  This year’s operations will be “very successful,” Kosyuk
said, adding that cost reduction “will be a nice surprise to
investors.” MHP will probably get approvals to export its
chicken meat to the European Union from June, Kosyuk said.  Revenue will increase to $1.4 billion in 2012 and earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization will be from
$450 million to $460 million, according to MHP forecasts.  “In poultry production, if you watch costs, you don’t have
risks,” Kosyuk said. MHP, which sells 87 percent of its chicken
meat domestically, expects prices in Ukraine to continue rising
after a 10 percent increase last year, he said.  Correlation with higher global poultry prices and falling
costs should protect MHP from currency risks, Kosyuk said.  “A possible hryvnia devaluation is the smallest problem
for us,” he said.  The company, which produces 380,000 tons of chicken meat a
year, plans to increase annual output by 220,000 tons from the
middle of 2014, Kosyuk said. By this time about 20 to 25 percent
of output will be sold abroad as MHP is looking for new markets
in  Africa ,  Asia  and the  Middle East .  MHP plans to invest $360 million to $370 million this year
and $150 million in 2013, mainly in the expansion of its new
plant in Vinnytsya, central Ukraine. The company is also looking
for acquisitions in countries with growing chicken meat
consumption in Asia and Europe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
