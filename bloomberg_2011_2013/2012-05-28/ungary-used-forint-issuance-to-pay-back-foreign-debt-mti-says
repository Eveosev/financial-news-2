Hungary used forint-denominated debt
to finance the repayment of as much as 360 billion forint ($1.5
billion) of foreign-currency debt this year, state news service
MTI said, citing Gyula Pleschinger, state secretary at the
 Economy Ministry .  The country, which has 5.5 billion euros in maturing debt
this year, has the resources to repay this debt, Pleschinger
said, adding that the government didnâ€™t want to use up its
reserves given the unfolding European crisis, MTI reported.  A financing agreement with the  International Monetary Fund 
and the European Union would help cut financing costs by as much
as 2 percentage points and would allow the central bank to
decrease the level of foreign-currency reserves, Pleschinger
said, according to MTI.  Parliament will vote on a planned financial transaction tax
in early July and the Cabinet will hold several rounds of talks
with commercial banks on the levy prior to the vote, MTI cited
Pleschinger as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
