Former TNK-BP executive Maxim Barskiy
offered the company’s billionaire shareholders a chance to
jointly buy Spanish oil company Vetra Group which holds assets
in  Colombia ,  Kommersant  reported today, citing people it didn’t
identify.  The AAR group, BP’s partner in TNK-BP, which represents
interests of billionaires  Mikhail Fridman ,  Len Blavatnik  and
 Victor Vekselberg , hasn't decided yet if it will help Barskiy’s
 Matra Petroleum Plc (MTA)  to fund the deal, which may be valued at
$500 million, Kommersant said.  Barskiy holds 29.8 percent in Matra and will become the
company’s chief executive officer next month. Vetra Group was
founded by Humberto Calderon Berti, former president of
Petroleos de Venezuela SA, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
