Beryl, the second named weather
system of the  Atlantic hurricane season , was downgraded to a
tropical depression after making landfall and moving over
northeast Florida, the National Hurricane Center said.  The weather system was about 60 miles (100 kilometers)
west-northwest of Jacksonville, with maximum sustained winds of
35 miles an hour, the Miami-based center said in an  advisory 
posted at 10:47 a.m.  New York  time.  Beryl is likely to turn northward later today and move to
the northeast tomorrow, the center said. All coastal tropical-
storm warnings have been discontinued, it said.  Beryl is “soaking portions of north Florida and South
Georgia,” the advisory said, predicting “more rain to come.”  A storm becomes tropical when thunderstorm activity begins
building close to the center of circulation, according to
 Weather Underground  Inc. of Ann Arbor, Michigan. A subtropical
storm usually has a large cloud-free center of circulation,
Weather Underground said.  Beryl may bring 4 to 8 inches of rain, with isolated
maximum amounts of 12 inches, from northern Florida through
southeastern North Carolina, the center said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
