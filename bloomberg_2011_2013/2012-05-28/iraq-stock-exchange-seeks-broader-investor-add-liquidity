The Iraqi bourse is asking local
companies to list shares and depositary receipts in  London  and
 New York  to attract investors and increase volumes, the bourse’s
chief executive officer said.  “We are encouraging our companies” to list on the  London
Stock Exchange (LSE)  or the Nasdaq Stock Market “to allow
shareholders to turn some of their shares into global depositary
receipts or American depositary receipts,” CEO Taha Ahmed Abdul Salam al-Rubaye said in Baghdad yesterday. Exchange officials
held meetings with  Bank of New York Mellon  regarding ADRs, he
said.  The  Iraq Stock Exchange (BBOB)  General Index has tumbled 21
percent since reaching the highest in at least two years on Oct.
4. It was little changed today at 116.20. There are 86 listed
companies on the exchange, from industries including banking,
agriculture, tourism and insurance. Financial companies made up
70 percent of the bourse’s $4 billion market value at the end of
2011, al-Rubaye said.  Economic growth in  Iraq  will accelerate to 11.1 percent
this year, the fastest since at least 2006, International
Monetary Fund forecasts show. The nation will also post its
second consecutive current account surplus at 9.1 percent of GDP
in 2012, after deficits in 2009 and 2010, according to the
Washington-based fund.  The nation, home to about 32 million people according to
World Bank estimates, has faced an escalation of violence and
political clashes since the U.S. pulled out its remaining troops
in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
