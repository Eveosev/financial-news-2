Prime Minister David Cameron
discussed with Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  plans to
insulate the British economy from any escalation of the euro-
area debt crisis.  The meeting in London today was also attended by Financial
Services Authority Chairman Adair Turner, Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne , Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.  It was part of a “series of meetings throughout government
to ensure the U.K. is properly placed to deal with the euro zone
situation and the issues arising from it,” Cameron’s office
said in an e-mailed statement.  Osborne said last week that the government is planning for
all euro-area contingencies and that a “critical point” is
approaching for the common currency region. The International
Monetary Fund said on May 22 that Britain requires further
monetary easing to aid the economy and Osborne should prepare
for temporary tax cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
