Former German Finance Minister  Peer Steinbrueck  said French President Francois Hollande’s proposals
may have an impact on the country’s credit rating,  Bild 
newspaper reported, citing an interview to be published
tomorrow.  “Investors and rating companies will naturally take a
close look at the course France sets,” Bild quoted Steinbrueck
as saying in response to a question about French proposals to
lower the  retirement age  and tax top earners at a higher rate.
“That can have consequences for France’s credit rating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
