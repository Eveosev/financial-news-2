OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, said profit rose 7.7 percent in the first quarter
on higher crude prices.  Net income advanced to $3.79 billion from $3.52 billion a
year earlier, the Moscow based company said today in a
regulatory filing. That beat the $3.10 billion average estimate
of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Revenue rose 19
percent to $35.3 billion.  Prices for Russia’s Urals export blend crude advanced 14
percent in the first three months of the year to an average
$116.98 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.
OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, and TNK-BP posted
declines on the quarter after losing tax exemptions.  Lukoil expects “significant dividend growth compared to
this year,” billionaire shareholder and Deputy Chief Executive
 Leonid Fedun  said at a presentation in  Hong Kong  today.  Oil and gas output fell 0.7 percent to 2.2 million barrels
a day due to declines in the Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu deposit, Lukoil
said. The company’s hydrocarbon extraction expenses were little
changed at $4.70 per barrel of oil equivalent, Lukoil said.  Capital expenditure rose to $2.46 billion in the quarter
from $1.72 billion in the year-earlier period. That was less
than expected, according to Pavel Sorokin, an oil and gas
analyst at  Alfa Bank .  “This is positive becuase first quarter operating results
were also strong,” Sorokin said.  Lukoil increased 2 percent to 1,670.30 rubles on Moscow’s
Micex at 11:39 a.m local time.  Lukoil is in talks with potential partners to develop
 Iraq ’s West Qurna-2 field and has recieved “considerable
interest” from Asian companies, Fedun said.  Lukoil, which is presenting the results in Hong Kong today
and holding a capital markets day tomorrow, is contemplating an
Asian listing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
