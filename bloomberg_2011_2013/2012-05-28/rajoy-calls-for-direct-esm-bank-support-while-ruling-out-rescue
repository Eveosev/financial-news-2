Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the
euro region’s rescue fund should be able to bypass national
governments and recapitalize distressed lenders directly, even
as he argued that Spanish lenders won’t need external support.  “Lots of people are in favor of that, and I certainly
am,” Rajoy told reporters in Madrid today at a hastily called
news briefing as  Spanish markets  tumbled. “There won’t be any
rescue of Spanish banks.”  European leaders are split over whether the European
Stability Mechanism should be able to recapitalize banks
directly, an EU official said on May 22, as its statutes say
support must be channeled through national governments. Spain,
which nationalized the country’s third-largest bank this month,
is trying to shore up lenders and help cash-strapped regions as
its own 10-year bond yields approach the 7 percent level that
prompted bailouts in  Greece , Ireland and Portugal.  Rajoy also repeated calls to European authorities to
support  Spanish (BKIA)  debt and erase doubts over the euro’s future. He
didn’t mention the  European Central Bank  by name, as he did
after a European summit on May 23.  “The government is doing what it should be doing,” Rajoy
said, as he called for more political, fiscal and monetary
integration in the 17-nation euro region. “ Europe  must
dissipate any doubts over the euro, affirm that the euro is an
irreversible project and act in consequence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
