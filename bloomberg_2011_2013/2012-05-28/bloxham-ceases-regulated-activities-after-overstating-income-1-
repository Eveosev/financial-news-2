Bloxham , the Dublin-based securities
firm, was ordered by the Irish central bank to cease all
regulated activities after informing the bank of “financial
irregularities.”  The issues, uncovered late last week, “relate to the
reporting and accounting of the firm’s income, which was
overstated over a number of years,” Bloxham said in an e-mailed
statement today. A partner at the firm has been suspended, it
said, without identifying the person.  No client funds are involved or at risk, Bloxham said. The
company no longer has sufficient capital to meet the central
bank’s licensing requirements as a stockbroker, Bloxham said.  Bloxham agreed to transfer all private client and fund
management business to  Davy , the country’s largest securities
firm, the central bank said in a statement. The central bank and
Bloxham are investigating, according to today’s statements.  Davy said in a separate statement it acquired Bloxham’s
asset-management business, which manages more than 700 million
euros ($880 million) of assets.  Bloxham traces its history back over 150 years and is based
in Ireland’s International Financial Services Center in Dublin.
Bloxham is a member of the Irish Stock Exchange and Euronext,
according to its home page.  To contact the reporters on this story:
