Remittances from Ecuadoreans living
abroad fell 9.2 percent to $596 million in the first quarter
from the year earlier as economic slowdowns in  Europe  and the
U.S. reduced immigrantsâ€™ earnings, the central bank said.  Remittances declined 8 percent from the previous three
months, the bank said today in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
