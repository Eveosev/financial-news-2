Three-time Masters Tournament winner
 Phil Mickelson  joined a group interested in purchasing  Major
League Baseball ’s San Diego Padres, according to the San Diego
Union-Tribune.  Mickelson, a 41-year-old San Diego native, is joining four
grandchildren of former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Walter O’Malley in exploring a bid for the Padres, the newspaper
 reported  today.  “I’ve had the opportunity to invest in other sports
franchises, and I’ve turned it down in the past,” Mickelson
told the newspaper. “This was a unique opportunity with
families that had done this before and know how to do it right
and want to get involved in the community.”  The group, whose Top of the Third Inc. owns the Arizona
Diamondbacks’ Class-A affiliate  Visalia Rawhide , are one of five
parties currently looking into purchasing John Moores’s
controlling stake of the Padres, the paper said.  Mickelson earned $48 million from May 2011 to May 2012,
making him the world’s sixth-highest paid athlete, according to
 Forbes valuations  published earlier this month. He was the
second golfer on the list behind  Tiger Woods , who made $58
million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
