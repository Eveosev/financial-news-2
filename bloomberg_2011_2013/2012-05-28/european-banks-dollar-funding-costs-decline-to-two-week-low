The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell to the lowest levels in more than two weeks,
according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 44 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:45 a.m. in
 London  compared with minus 48 on May 25, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The cost is the cheapest since May 10.  The one-year basis swap was 62.5 basis points below Euribor
from minus 63 on May 25. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- were little changed at 32 basis points.  The Euribor/OIS spread was at 39 basis points from 40 on
May 25.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  on May 25, placing 760 billion euros ($958
billion) from 761 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
