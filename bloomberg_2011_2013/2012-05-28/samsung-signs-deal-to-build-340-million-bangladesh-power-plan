Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) , the construction
and trading arm of South Korea’s Samsung Group, signed an accord
with Electricity Generation Co. of  Bangladesh  and Spain’s Isolux
Ingenieria SA to build a power plant in the South Asian nation.  The 335-megawatt project will be built in Siddhirganj, 20
kilometers (12 miles) southeast of the capital, Dhaka, the
state-owned Bangladesh utility said in a statement today.  Bangladesh is spending $10 billion over a decade to
increase generation capacity in a nation where more than half of
the 166 million people don’t have access to electricity. Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed is seeking to boost spending on
power plants, roads and ports and lure foreign investors to the
$106 billion economy.  The  World Bank  will provide $196 million of the project’s
estimated cost of $340 million, Mehrin Ahmed Mahbub,
communications officer at the lender’s Bangladesh office, said
by telephone from Dhaka.  The power plant is expected to start in December 2014,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
