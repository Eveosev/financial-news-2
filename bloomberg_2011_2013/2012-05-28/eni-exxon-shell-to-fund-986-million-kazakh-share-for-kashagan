Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  agreed to fund the $986 million costs owed by
Kazakhstan’s state energy producer for one of the world’s
biggest oil fields, Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev said.  The foreign partners will pay Kazmunaigaz’s share of the
costs for Kashagan this year and next, Mynbayev told reporters
in Astana today. It wasn’t clear if Kazmunaigaz will repay its
foreign partners out of future revenue from the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
