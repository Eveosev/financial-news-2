Remarks by  Michael McFaul , the U.S.
ambassador, during a May 25 talk at the Moscow Higher School of
Economics were “unprofessional” and went “far beyond the
limits of diplomatic etiquette,” the Russian Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs  said in a  statement  on its website.  In the lecture, McFaul accused Russia of bribing Kyrgyzstan
in 2009 to push the local government to close down the U.S.
military airbase in the Manas airport in Bishkek.  In January, Andrei Isayev, a senior lawmaker in Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin’s party, accused McFaul of seeking to
foment revolution in Russia by hosting opposition activists.  In response to the statement, McFaul said in a Twitter
message he is “still learning the craft of speaking more
diplomatically.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
