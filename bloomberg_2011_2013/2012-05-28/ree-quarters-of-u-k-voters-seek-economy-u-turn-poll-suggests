Nearly three-quarters of U.K. voters
say the government should reverse its economic policy to give
priority to growth rather than spending cuts, a poll indicated.  Seventy-two percent of those questioned by ComRes Ltd. for
the Independent newspaper said it’s time for a change of policy,
while 17 percent disagreed and 11 percent didn’t know, the
polling company said in an e-mailed statement today.  ComRes interviewed 1,001 British adults by telephone from
May 25 to May 28. It didn’t give a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
