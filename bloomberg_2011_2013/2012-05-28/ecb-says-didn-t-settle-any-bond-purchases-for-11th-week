The  European Central Bank  said it
didn’t buy any government bond purchases for an 11th straight
week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it will take seven-day term
deposits tomorrow to absorb the 212 billion euros ($266 billion)
of liquidity created since the program started in May 2010, a
practice it employs to ensure the purchases don’t fuel
inflation. The ECB halted the bond-buying program after its two
three-year loans to banks totaling more than 1 trillion euros
helped debt markets to rally.
