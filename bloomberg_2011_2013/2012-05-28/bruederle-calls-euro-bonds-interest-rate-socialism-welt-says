The euro area bonds proposed by
French President  Francois Hollande  would be “interest rate
socialism” that would saddle  Germany  with high costs,  Die Welt 
reported, citing Rainer Bruederle, deputy chairman of the Free
Democratic Party.  “Euro bonds are interest-rate socialism for which Germany
and other successful countries will have to pay dearly,” the
newspaper quoted him as saying in an interview. It would be far
better for young French and Spanish people to move to Germany
for job training, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
