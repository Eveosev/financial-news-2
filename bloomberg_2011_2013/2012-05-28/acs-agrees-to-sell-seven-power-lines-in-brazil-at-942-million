ACS-Actividades de Construccion &
Servicios SA , a Spanish construction company, agreed to sell
seven power transmission lines in  Brazil  as it continues its
asset disposal strategy to reduce debt.  ACS, through its units Area Industrial, Cobra, Cymi and
CME, signed an accord to sell seven power lines in Brazil at an
enterprise value equivalent to 751.7 million euros ($942.2
million), the Madrid-based builder said in a statement today.  ACS said 423.4 million euros was equity and the remaining
328.3 million euros was debt. The transaction is pending
regulatory approval, it added.  As Spanish building companies are hit by government
spending cuts on infrastructure to reduce the budget deficit,
ACS is selling assets to pay down debt. Last month, ACS sold 10
percent of  Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE)  for 875.3 million euros
as builder  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL)  built a stake in the toll-
highway operator.  ACS shares fell 0.9 percent to 13.82 euros. The stock has
lost almost 40 percent of its value this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
