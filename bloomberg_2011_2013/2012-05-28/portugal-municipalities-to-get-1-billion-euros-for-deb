Portugal ’s government will approve a
1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion)  credit line  to municipalities to
help them repay short-term debt to suppliers, said Miguel Relvas, the country’s minister for parliamentary affairs.  “The credit line, with a total value of 1 billion euros,
aims to inject money into the local economy,” Relvas said at a
news conference in Lisbon today after meeting the president of
the country’s association of municipalities, Fernando Ruas.  Ruas said in an interview on March 21 that Portugal’s
municipalities hold as much as 9 billion euros of debt and may
face default unless the government provides aid soon.  Portugal is also encouraging local administrations to merge
as part of a plan to save money and comply with the terms of a
78 billion-euro bailout from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund .  In return for the credit line, local governments have
promised to cut back on spending, control their short-term debt
and pay suppliers on time or risk facing sanctions from the
central government, Relvas said.  “I want to underline that local governments will not stay
on the sidelines of the adjustment effort imposed on all the
Portuguese people,” Relvas said.  The southern European country’s municipalities face similar
issues to those of  Spain , whose regions and municipalities have
been shut out of  capital markets . Spain’s government is offering
them loans to help pay suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
