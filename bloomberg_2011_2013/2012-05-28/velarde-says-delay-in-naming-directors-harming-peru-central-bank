Peruvian lawmakers are being
“irresponsible” by putting off a decision to replace three of
the central bank’s seven directors, bank president Julio Velarde
said.  The existing board can’t plan future strategy because it
doesn’t know if the new directors will agree with their
decisions, Velarde told reporters in Lima today.  President  Ollanta Humala  replaced three directors on the
board on Oct. 3 and ratified Velarde to serve a second, five-
year term. Now Congress needs to pick replacements for Beatriz Boza,Alfonso Lopez and Abel Salinas, who’ve been on the board
since September 2006 and whose mandates have expired. They will
remain as directors until replacements are named.  “It’s difficult to advance,” Velarde said. “There’s
never been a situation before in which it’s taken so long to
name. It’s clearly irresponsible.”  Jurgen Schuldt,  Francisco Gonzalez  and Rafael Lopez de Aliaga are candidates to be legislators’ representatives on the
board, Congress said May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
