     May 28 (Bloomberg) -- Orascom Telecom Holding SAE said its
Algerian unit is taking steps to file an appeal with  Algeria ’s
 Supreme Court  after a lower court upheld a $1.3 billion fine for
violating foreign exchange regulations.  “Orascom Telecom Algerie maintains that Orascom Telecom
Algerie and its senior executive have acted in compliance with
the law and Orascom Telecom Algerie is taking the necessary
steps to file an appeal with the Algerian Supreme Court,” the
company said in a statement distributed via the Regulatory News
Service. “The lodging of the appeal will provisionally suspend
the judgment.”  Algerian Court of Appeal confirmed the judgment handed
down by the Algerian Court of First Instance on March 28 against
the unit that operates under Djezzy brandname. The Algiers court
suspended a two-year sentence against the Chief Executive
Officer of Djezzy, Tamer El Mahdi, and asked the company to pay
a fine of 6 billion dinars ($79 million) on his behalf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
