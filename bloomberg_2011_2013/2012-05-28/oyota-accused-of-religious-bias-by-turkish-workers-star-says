Former employees of  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  in  Turkey  told parliament and prosecutors that they were
discriminated against because of their Islamic religious
beliefs, Star newspaper  reported .  Workers who lost their jobs at the Japanese carmaker’s
plant in Sakarya and a  Toyota Boshoku Corp. (3116)  factory in the same
northwestern province told the national assembly’s human rights
committee that they were asked whether they pray, observe
Islamic fasts, consume alcohol or eat pork, according to the
Istanbul-based newspaper.  The former employees said that practising Muslims were
prevented from praying and given bad performance reviews, Star
reported. Committee Chairman Ayhan Sefer Ustun wrote to Akio Toyoda, telling the Toyota president that the allegations are
“very serious” and urging him to address the issue right away,
the newspaper said.  The press office at Toyota’s Turkish headquarters didn’t
immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
