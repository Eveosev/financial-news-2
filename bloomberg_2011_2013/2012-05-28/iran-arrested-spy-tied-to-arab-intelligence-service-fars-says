Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard Corps has
arrested a spy working for the intelligence service of an Arab
country, the state-run  Fars  news agency reported, citing a
statement by the Guards.  The person was identified and arrested after he entered the
landing area of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s helicopter during a recent
trip by the president to the eastern city of Sabzevar in Iran,
the statement released yesterday said, according to Fars.  The individual, who wasn’t identified, admitted to
transferring “sensitive information” to contacts in an Arab
nation, the report said without naming the country. The Guards
also found ammunition, weapons and telecommunication tools
during the operation, Fars said.  Iran has arrested more than 40 spies linked to the U.S. and
 Israel  in the past year, according to Fars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
