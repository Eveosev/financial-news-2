The first drop in platinum mine
supply in four years and record car sales, the biggest source of
demand, are reducing a surplus of the metal and shoring up
prices on the brink of a  bear market .  Output will drop 4 percent to 6.14 million ounces this year
as labor strikes and safety concerns disrupt mining in South
Africa, the biggest producer, Barclays Plc estimates. That will
diminish the annual glut by 90 percent to 37,000 ounces, the
bank predicts. Prices will average $1,750 an ounce in the fourth
quarter, 22 percent more than now, the median of 13 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The metal, used to make autocatalysts and jewelry, slid 16
percent in the past three months and  hedge funds  are now their
least bullish since at least 2009 on speculation that slower
global economic growth will curb demand. Prices are now within
about 1 percentage point of average production costs, which
continue to rise as companies dig as deep as 1.3 miles to find
ore and face surging wage and energy bills.  “Platinum is very, very cheap at the moment,” said
 Thorsten Proettel , an analyst at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg
in Stuttgart,  Germany  and the third-most accurate forecaster of
platinum prices in Bloomberg Rankings in the two years through
December. “It’s more the supply side which could help the
platinum price accelerate because supply is very tight.”  Bear Market  The metal’s 18 percent plunge to $1,430.75 since late
February leaves it within 2 percentage points of the common
definition of a bear market. The slump pared this year’s gain to
2.1 percent, still beating the performance of gold, silver and
palladium. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24
commodities fell 4.2 percent since the start of January and the
MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose 1.4 percent.
Treasuries returned 1.2 percent, a Bank of America Corp.  index (MXWD) 
shows.  It costs an average $1,437 to extract an ounce of platinum,
according to Proettel. The slide in prices is eroding earnings,
discouraging the development of new mines or expansions.  Impala
Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the second-biggest producer, will report
a 21 percent drop in net income in 2012 while London-based
Lonmin Plc, the third largest, will make 76 percent less profit
in its fiscal year ending in September, analysts estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Hedge funds and other large speculators cut  wagers  on a
rally by 70 percent to 6,200 U.S. futures and options in the
three months through May 22, according to Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data. Holdings in exchange-traded products
backed by the metal dropped 11 percent to 41.1 metric tons
valued at $1.9 billion since September, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Electrical Goods  Rebounding prices may encourage more recycling,
compensating for the decline in mine output. Scrap supply from
autocatalysts, electrical goods and jewelry reached a record
2.05 million ounces last year, from 565,000 ounces in 2002,
according to Johnson Matthey Plc, the maker of about one in
three of all autocatalysts. Prices averaged an all-time high of
$1,721 last year, compared with $541 in 2002.  The surge is encouraging carmakers to use more palladium in
autocatalysts, canisters that have honeycomb-like surfaces and
convert emissions into less harmful substances. Platinum’s
sister metal is trading at $604.50 an ounce. Palladium accounted
for about 30 percent of the metal loaded into catalytic
converters for diesel-power vehicles last year, up from 20
percent in 2009, London-based Johnson Matthey estimates.  Largest Car Market  Demand for platinum, which Barclays anticipates will grow 1
percent to 7.99 million ounces this year, may fall short of
expectations as economic growth weakens.  China , the world’s
largest car market, expanded 8.1 percent in the first quarter,
the slowest pace in almost three years. About $4.2 trillion was
erased from the value of global equities since April on concern
that  Greece  will exit the 17-nation  euro zone .  Global sales of cars and light commercial vehicles are
poised to rise 5.5 percent to a record 79.4 million units this
year, according to LMC Automotive Ltd., a research company in
Oxford,  England . Carmakers account for 38 percent of platinum
consumption, Johnson Matthey estimates.  Prices may also rebound as supply becomes more constricted.
Mining companies are contending with strikes by workers
demanding higher wages. South African inflation rose to 6.1
percent in April, up from 3.5 percent at the end of 2010,
government data show. Workers at Johannesburg-based Impala’s
Rustenburg mine in  South Africa , the world’s biggest, started a
month-long strike over a pay dispute in January that cut more
than 120,000 ounces of output. The company said May 24 that the
latest labor unrest at the site cost 6,000 ounces.  Miners Killed  Work has also been suspended after 123 mining deaths and
2,918 injuries in South Africa last year, Mineral Resources
Minister Susan Shabangu told reporters March 20. The platinum
industry lost about 300,000 ounces of production last year
because of safety stoppages, London-based Anglo American Plc
said Feb. 17.  Mine disruptions in the first quarter drove platinum prices
17 percent higher, the best performance in three years. While
most of that was erased in the subsequent slump, the metal’s
gain since the start of January compares with a 2.3 percent
advance in silver, 0.8 percent increase in gold and a 7.9
percent drop in palladium.  Energy Prices  Lonmin extracted 4.4 grams of platinum-group metals from
every ton of ore last year, 5.4 percent less than in 2010,
according to the company’s annual report. Production costs rose
11 percent because of wages, energy prices, safety stoppages and
strikes.  The company will report net income of $66.4 million in the
12 months through Sept. 30, compared with $273 million a year
earlier, the mean of nine estimates shows. Impala will make 5.25
billion rand ($630 billion), compared with 6.64 billion rand in
2011, according to the mean of seven estimates.  That contrasts with Anglo American Platinum Ltd., the
biggest producer, which is expected to post earnings of 4.35
billion rand this year, from 3.59 billion rand in 2010, the mean
of six estimates shows. Shares of the Johannesburg-based company
fell 10 percent this year, compared with a 17 percent drop for
Impala and 24 percent retreat for Lonmin.  Shafts now extend down as much as 2,115 meters (6,940 feet)
and temperatures at the rock face of Northam Platinum Ltd.’s
Zondereinde mine in South Africa can reach as high as 162
degrees Fahrenheit (72 degrees Celsius). It uses as many as
seven refrigeration units to pump chilled air into the mine,
according to data on the company’s website.  “For many producers the price is insufficiently high to
sustain the industry,” said  Bart Melek , the head of commodity
strategy at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto. “Given the fact that
we’re going to see some decent demand growth over the next
several years, we’re going to have to see expansion.”  To contact the reporters for this story:
