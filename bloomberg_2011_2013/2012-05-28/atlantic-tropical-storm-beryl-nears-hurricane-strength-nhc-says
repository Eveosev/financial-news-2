Tropical Storm Beryl, the second
named storm of the 2012 Atlantic season, is nearing hurricane
strength as its head for the  Florida  coast, according to the
U.S. National Hurricane Center.  The weather system is about 75 miles (121 kilometers) east
of Jacksonville, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 70
miles per hour, the Miami-based center said in an  advisory 
posted at 8 p.m.  New York  time.  Beryl is moving at 10 mph and is expected to turn northward
over northeastern Florida and southeastern Georgia by Monday
night. A tropical storm warning is in effect from the Brevard-
Volusia County line in Florida to Edisto Beach,  South Carolina ,
the advisory showed.  “Little change in strength is expected prior to landfall
but any additional increase in strength would make Beryl a
category one hurricane,” the center said in the statement.  Gusts may reach hurricane speeds over parts of northeastern
Florida and southeastern  Georgia  and flooding is possible with
water rising to as much as 4 feet (1.2 meters) above ground,
according to the center. Beryl is expected to weaken to a
tropical depression by tonight after landfall.  A storm becomes tropical when thunderstorm activity begins
building close to the center of circulation, according to
Weather Underground Inc. of Ann Arbor,  Michigan . A subtropical
storm usually has a large cloud-free center of circulation,
Weather Underground said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
