NMDC Ltd. (NMDC) ,  India ’s largest  iron-ore 
producer, reported a 22 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit
after increased production from its mines in the southern state
of Karnataka failed to counter sliding prices.  Net income  fell to 16.4 billion rupees ($297 million), or
4.14 rupees a share, in the three months ended March 31 from 21
billion rupees, or 5.29 rupees, a year earlier, the company
based in the southern city of Hyderabad said today in a
statement. The average  profit estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was 16.9 billion rupees. Sales declined 31 percent
to 25.9 billion rupees.  The cash price of 62 percent-content iron ore delivered to
Tianjin port in  China , the biggest consumer, averaged 20 percent
lower in the last quarter from a year earlier, according to
Steel Business Briefing. NMDC raised production after the
nation’s top court in August ruled the state-run company would
be the only miner in Karnataka.  Total costs at NMDC tumbled 39 percent to 6.49 billion
rupees, according to the statement. Income from sources other
than its main business gained 24 percent to 5.47 billion rupees.  NMDC shares fell 1.7 percent to 167.85 rupees at the close
in Mumbai. The  stock  has gained 4.3 percent this year, compared
with a 6.2 percent gain in the key  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   The earnings were announced after the markets closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
