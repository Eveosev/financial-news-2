Darren Clarke , winner of golf’s
British Open last year, will miss the U.S. Open next month
because of a groin injury.  The 43-year-old Northern Irishman will not play again until
the Irish Open at the end of June on his home course of  Royal
Portrush , Clarke announced today on  his website .  Clarke has struggled with the injury for more than a month
and doctors have advised him to take a month off. He said he
wanted to be 100 percent healthy to defend his British Open
title at  Royal Lytham & St. Annes  in July.  “I haven’t been able to get through the ball properly
because of it and I don’t want to take any chances,” he said.  The  U.S. Open , hosted this year by the Olympic Club in San
Francisco, will run June 14-17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
