Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter
of liquefied natural gas, forecast its  budget surplus  at 23
percent of expenditure in fiscal 2012-2013 compared with 16
percent in the previous year.  The budget surplus represents 8 percent of gross domestic
product compared with 6.7 percent in the previous year’s budget,
the state-run  Qatar News Agency reported . Revenue will increase
27 percent and expenditure will rise 28 percent, QNA said.  The budget assumed an average oil price of $65 a barrel to
calculate projected revenue, QNA said. The country had based its
budgets on an oil price of $55 a barrel in the previous two
fiscal years. Non-hydrocarbon revenues account for 30 percent of
total revenues in the current fiscal year, which started on
April 1, up from 24 percent the previous year.  Oil prices  averaged $113.67 a barrel over the past year in
London.  Qatar registered the world’s fastest economic growth the
past two years, according to the  International Monetary Fund , as
it increased exports of the fuel and completed new liquefaction
plants. The country, which will host the 2022 soccer  World Cup ,
plans to invest $45 billion in infrastructure for the event,
including $9 billion on new stadiums and sporting facilities,
the economic planning board said in October.  Economic growth will slow to 5 percent this year from 15
percent last year as expansion of gas exports slows, the board
said.  The release of the budget was delayed after the government
revised its accounting system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
