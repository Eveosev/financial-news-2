Kofi Annan’s trip to Syria “leaves
chances for a political settlement,” Deputy Minister of Russian
Foreign Affairs Gennady Gatilov said in a Twitter  message .  “It’s important that even in this critical situation, K.
Annan didn’t cancel his trip to Syria,” Gatilov wrote.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces and foreign-
backed rebels are both to blame for the massacre of more than
100 people in the town of Houla, Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  said after talks in Moscow with his U.K. counterpart
 William Hague  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
