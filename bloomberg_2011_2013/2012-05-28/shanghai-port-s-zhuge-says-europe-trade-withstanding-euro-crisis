Shanghai International Port (Group)
Co. (600018)  President Zhuge Yujie comments on European trade and the
possibility of the euro region breaking up. He spoke today at a
press conference in Shanghai.  On euro region:  “We definitely don’t want a breakup of the Euro currency
region to happen. It is not in the interest of any port operator
for that to happen.”  On  Europe  trade:  “In our experience, the situation in Europe doesn’t seem
as serious as has been reported. We are still seeing growth in
the shipments to Europe, and there should be little impact in
2012. Most shipments in and out of Europe, and between the major
ports globally, this year have already been planned out.  ‘‘That said, the business climate for freight operators
will be difficult.’’  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
