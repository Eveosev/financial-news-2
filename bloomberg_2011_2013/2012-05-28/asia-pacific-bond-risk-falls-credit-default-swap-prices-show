The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index slid 3 basis points to 195
basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. The gauge is set for its lowest close since May 7, falling
from a seven-month high of 217.3 on May 18, according to data
provider CMA. The index is headed for a third monthly increase,
rising from 182.4 at the end of April, CMA prices show.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 2 basis points to 197 basis
points as of 8:17 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The index is headed for its lowest close since May 22,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. It
is up from 164.9 at the end of last month, the data show.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 1 basis point to 198
as of 10:17 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show. The
benchmark has traded between 154.5 and 201 basis points this
month, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
