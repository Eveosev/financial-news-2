Longhorn Kenya Ltd. , the educational
publisher that will be listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange
on May 30, said full-year profit surged more than fivefold to
136.3 million shillings ($1.59 million).  Sales jumped to 1.1 billion shillings in the 12 months
through June 2011 from 526.9 million shillings a year earlier,
the Nairobi-based company said in an e-mailed prospectus in
Kenya’s capital today.  “This remarkable growth was attributed to huge export
sales into the Rwanda market,” Longhorn said.  The company, which has units in Uganda and Tanzania, plans
to issue 58.5 million shares at 14 shillings each. They will be
listed by introduction, meaning Longhorn won’t raise new
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
