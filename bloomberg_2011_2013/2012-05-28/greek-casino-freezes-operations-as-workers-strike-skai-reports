Parnitha Casino suspended operations
on May 25 after 1,150 workers went on strike,  Skai TV  reported
on its website, without saying how it got the information.  Employees of the casino, which is partly owned by the state
and partly by Greeceâ€™s biggest builder  Ellaktor SA (ELLAKTOR) , went on
strike in order to secure a collective labor agreement to
replace the current one expiring on June 6, the Athens-based
broadcaster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
