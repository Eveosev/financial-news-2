(Corrects currency conversion in first paragraph.)  PGE SA (PGE) , Polandâ€™s biggest electricity
producer, is working on a 2 billion euros ($2.52 billion) bond
sale program, Chief Financial Officer Wojciech Ostrowski said in
an interview with the Parkiet newspaper.  The company may also set a new zloty bond sale program at
the end of this year as one of its two current programs will end
in November 2013, Ostrowski said. PGE will first sell zloty
bonds before selling notes denominated in euros, Parkiet cited
him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
