Seyid Ould Ghailani, head of
Mauritania’s  Supreme Court , rejected a decree from President
Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz dismissing him from the post.
“I was appointed two years ago as president of the Supreme
Court for a five-year term, I have not resigned,” he told
reporters yesterday in front of the court building, where he was
prevented from entering by soldiers.  A decree from Aziz yesterday appointed Yahfdhou Ould
Mohamed Youssef, a lawyer, to replace Ghailani, state-owned
press agency AMI reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
