Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, pumped 9.1 million barrels a day of oil
on average last year, the state-run company known as Saudi
Aramco said in its annual review.  Average daily output rose 15 percent from 2010, according
to the review posted today on Aramco’s website. Reserves of
crude oil and condensates fell 0.2 percent to 259.7 billion
barrels compared with the previous year, while deposits of
natural gas increased 1.3 percent to 282.6 trillion standard
cubic feet, it said.  Saudi Arabia  has started a program to explore for energy
resources in frontier areas including the Red Sea,  Ali al-Naimi ,
the country’s oil minister, said at a May 14 conference in
 Adelaide ,  Australia . The government wants to increase the
recovery rate at the country’s biggest producing fields to 70
percent from 50 percent, he said. The desert kingdom is
exploring for gas, a fuel used in  power plants , to help meet
rising domestic demand for electricity.  Aramco’s annual oil output rose to 3.31 billion barrels
from 2.89 billion barrels in 2010, it said. Saudi Arabia, the
largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries boosted crude production last year to the highest
level in three decades as supply was disrupted from  Libya .  Gas Production  Saudi Arabia is developing its gas resources to power new
industries such as petrochemicals, helping the country reduce
its dependence on oil export income.  Saudi Aramco said it expects to complete the construction
of its Wasit gas plant in 2014 that will process 2.5 billion
cubic feet a day of non-associated gas from Hasbah and Arabiya
offshore fields. The plant will be able to handle as much as
3.05 billion cubic feet a day from the two fields at times of
peak demand.  It expects to complete its natural gas liquids project at
Shaybah in the Empty Quarter desert in 2014, according to the
report. The plant will produce ethane for use in petrochemicals,
it said.  Saudi Aramco  may start using carbon dioxide to aid
recovery rates at Ghawar, its largest field, in 2013, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
