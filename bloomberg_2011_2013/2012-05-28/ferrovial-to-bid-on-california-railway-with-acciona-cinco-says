Four Spanish companies are included
in the five groups of builders that qualified to bid on the
first section of  California ’s $68 billion high-speed railway
project, Cinco Dias reported, citing no one.  Ferrovial SA (FER)  and Acciona SA joined forces in a consortium
called Backbone Builders, while Actividades de Construccion y
Servicios SA will bid with Shimmick Construction Co. of the
U.S., the report said. Spain’s Comsa Emte has teamed U.S.
partners Kiewit Infrastructure West Co. and Granite Construction
Co., the Spanish newspaper said.  Californian authorities expect offers this summer for a 29-
mile section worth $1.5 billion of 800-mile long “bullet
train” project to link San Francisco and Sacramento in the
north to Los Angeles and San Diego about 800 miles to the south,
according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
