Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  denied
breaking the law after banks in  Zimbabwe  were ordered to stop
processing exports for the second-largest producer of the metal
until it shifts foreign accounts onshore.  The May 23 central bank directive suspending banking
services for the company over its use of offshore accounts is
“unfortunate,” Johannesburg-based Impala said today in a
statement. It prevents banks from facilitating international
transactions for Zimplats.  The restrictions add pressure to Impala’s operations in
Zimbabwe, where the government is also requiring it to sell a
controlling stake to locals. Zimplats accounted for 17 percent
of Impala’s  earnings  excluding one-time items in fiscal 2011.  The existence and operation of Zimplats’ offshore bank
accounts is contained in the terms of an agreement between the
company and the government,  Zimplats (ZIM)  said.  Zimplats puts 75 percent of its total spending through the
Zimbabwean banking system, with the balance relating mainly to
the servicing of offshore loans “which were raised with the
knowledge, support and approval” of the central bank, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
