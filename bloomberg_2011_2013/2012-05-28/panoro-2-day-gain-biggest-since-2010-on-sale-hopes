Panoro Minerals Ltd. (PML)  rallied the most
over two days in almost a year in Lima as copper gained and
investors speculated the Canadian company will take on a partner
to develop properties in Peru.  Vancouver-based Panoro rose 7.5 percent to 72 cents today
in Lima. The company gained 22 percent over the past two days,
the most on a closing basis since June 8, 2011. The stock has
doubled this year, the biggest rally among companies in Peru’s
benchmark  IGBVL (IGBVL)  equity index, which rose 0.5 percent today.
Copper increased 0.6 percent in  London .  “Investors expect the company will sell a stake,” said
Jose Luis Bustamante, head of trading at Cartisa SAB in  Lima .
“Quite a few companies have Panoro in their sights.”  Panoro may sell one of its Peruvian copper and gold
properties this year, country manager Christian Pilon said in a
Nov. 16 interview.  “Panoro’s projects are of permanent interest among
miners,” Pilon said today in e-mailed comments. “It’s
difficult to control speculation.”  Vancouver-based Panoro, which raised $6.5 million from a
private placement last year, has discovered 90 million metric
tons of 0.77 percent copper resources at its Cotabambas deposit
and 154 million metric tons at its Antilla property with ore
grades of 0.47 percent copper.  The company plans to drill another 20,000 meters at
Cotabambas to expand ore reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
