The forint strengthened for a third
day against the euro as Greek opinion polls eased concern that
the country will exit the euro, boosting demand for riskier
assets.  The Hungarian currency appreciated 0.7 percent to 297.57
per euro by 11:14 a.m. in  London , adding to a 0.9 percent gain
in the previous two sessions. Local markets were closed for a
holiday.  Emerging-market stocks gained for a third day and the euro
rebounded from the lowest since 2010 against the dollar.
 Greece â€™s New Democracy, which supports the austerity plan
negotiated with international lenders, placed first in all six
opinion polls published on May 26 as campaigning continued for
the general election on June 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
