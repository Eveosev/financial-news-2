Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  and  Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330)  will extend an agreement to
cooperate on developing and manufacturing microcontrollers used
in cars and  DVD players .  TSMC, the world’s largest custom chipmaker, will make 40-
nanometer chips for Kanagawa, Japan-based Renesas, expanding a
deal to produce 90-nanometer units, the companies said in a
press release today.  The announcement comes as Renesas, the world’s biggest
maker of automotive microcontrollers, was said to be planning to
raise capital of 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion) and eliminate
more than 10,000 jobs, according to the latest draft of a
restructuring plan, a person briefed on the matter said May 25.  The Japanese chipmaker presented the proposal this week to
its workers’ union and lenders Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. The job cuts would amount
to almost a quarter of the company’s 42,800-strong workforce as
it seeks to return to profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
