Eco-Bat Technologies Ltd., the
largest refined lead producer in  Europe  and  South Africa ,
reported a 53 percent decline in first quarter profit because of
lower prices and sales of the metal.  Net income fell to 20.59 million pounds ($32.2 million) in
the three months ended March 31 from 44 million pounds in the
same period a year earlier, the Matlock, England-based company
said in an e-mailed report today. Revenue dropped 10 percent to
435.9 million pounds.  Lead for delivery in three months averaged $2,117 a metric
ton in the first quarter, down 18 percent from a year earlier.
Eco-Bat said about 88 percent of its production was recycled
lead mostly from old lead-acid batteries. Lead sales fell
3.1 percent to 213,700 tons from 220,500 tons, it said.  “Sales volumes during the latter part of 2011 and the
first quarter of 2012 are slightly down against the same period
a year ago, principally due to the relatively mild winter
weather conditions experienced across Western Europe and  North
America ,” Eco-Bat said. “Against the current background of a
declining LME price and the continuation of the increasing
prices as a result of a shortage of scrap in both Europe and
North America, the group will plan for this continuance of what
is historically lower scrap margins.”  ((Eco-Bat will hold a conference call at 2 p.m. U.K. time.
