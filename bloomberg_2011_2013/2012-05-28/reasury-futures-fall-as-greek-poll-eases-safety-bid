Treasury futures fell, eroding gains
made at the end of last week, as opinion polls in  Greece  showed
voters back parties that support the European Union’s bailout,
easing concern the nation will leave the currency bloc.  Bond futures slid and Asia stocks advanced as demand for
the relative safety of government debt ebbed. Greece’s New
Democracy party, which supports the plan negotiated with
international lenders, placed first in all six opinion polls
published on May 26 as candidates campaigned for an election
next month.  “It’s a relief,” said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in
 Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a unit of  Japan ’s third-
largest publicly traded bank by assets.  “It’s negative for the
Treasury market.”  Ten-year futures contracts for June delivery slid 6/32, or
$1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 133 18/32 as of 9:55 a.m. in
 Singapore . They rose 7/32 on May 25.  Cash trading of Treasuries is  closed  today for the Memorial
Day holiday in the U.S., according to the Securities Industry
and Financial Markets Association in  New York .  U.S. government securities returned 1 percent this month as
of May 25, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show,
reflecting demand for the haven of Treasuries. Investors who
track the MSCI All-Country World Index of  stocks  lost 8.3
percent in the same period, including reinvested dividends.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks rose 0.4 percent
today, set for the first advance in four days.  Japan’s 10-year rate slid one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.875 percent today. It was as low as 0.815
percent on May 18, a level not seen since 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
