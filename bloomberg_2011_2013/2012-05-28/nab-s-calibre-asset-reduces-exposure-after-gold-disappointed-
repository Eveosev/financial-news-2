Gold hasn’t been able to deliver as a
haven in the past few months, said  Norman Chan , head of
investment at Calibre Asset Management Ltd., a unit of National
Australia Bank Ltd. Bullion is set for its fourth monthly
decline in May, the longest losing run since 1999. He spoke in a
Bloomberg television interview in  Hong Kong  today.  On gold holdings:  “We have reduced gold and increased our exposure in fixed
income mostly because gold has disappointed us in May. On top of
that, it has not been able to deliver a safe-asset nature,
dropping along with the equity market, so we think that confirms
the fundamental supply-demand deterioration in gold and we have
to cut.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
