Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) ,  India ’s
second-largest mobile-phone operator, gained the most in almost
six weeks in Mumbai trading after increasing revenue from voice
calls in the world’s second-biggest mobile market.  The  shares  increased as much as 4.7 percent and were
trading 3.1 percent higher at 67.55 rupees as of 10 a.m., poised
for its biggest one-day gain since April 17. India’s benchmark
Sensitive Index, or Sensex, advanced 0.6 percent.  Reliance reported fourth-quarter profit of 3.32 billion
rupees ($60 million) on May 26, beating analysts’ estimates for
earnings of 1.69 billion rupees, as customers increased usage of
their phones. Subscribers spent 103 billion minutes on
Reliance’s network, up 3.1 percent from the previous quarter.  Reliance, the flagship company of billionaire-Chairman Anil Ambani, joined competitors  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  and  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD)  in raising call rates for the first time in more than two
years in 2011. Reliance, which spent 85.9 billion rupees buying
airwave permits for third-generation services two years ago, is
evaluating an initial public offering of its submarine-cable
unit to reduce its debt load.  Mumbai-based Reliance had been expected to post profit of
1.69 billion rupees in the three months ended March, according
to the median of 22  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story: Kartikay Mehrotra in  New
