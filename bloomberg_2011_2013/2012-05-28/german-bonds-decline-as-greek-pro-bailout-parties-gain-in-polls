Spanish bonds fell, pushing 10-year
yields to the most relative to benchmark German bunds since the
euro was created, amid concern the nation’s lenders will need
additional financial support to weather  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Spain’s two-year note yield climbed to the highest since
December after nationalized lender  Bankia group  said it will
seek 19 billion euros ($23.8 billion) of state support. German
two-year note yields dropped to a record even as opinion polls
showed greater backing for  Greece ’s pro-bailout political
parties. Italian bonds declined as business confidence slid more
than economists forecast and borrowing costs rose at a sale of
zero-coupon notes.  “The weakness in Spain and Italy is primarily down to the
Bankia rescue,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at
Monument Securities Ltd. in  London . “The Greek polls offer some
grounds for optimism but that’s a very short-termist view.”  The yield on  Spain ’s  10-year bond  climbed 16 basis points,
or 0.16 percentage point, to 6.47 percent at 4:31 p.m. London
time. The 5.85 percent security due in January 2022 dropped
1.07, or 10.70 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 95.625.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of their German counterparts expanded by 17 basis points
to 511 basis points after reaching 514 basis points, the most
since the euro’s introduction in 1999.  Spanish  two-year yields  increased 11 basis points to 4.46
percent after reaching 4.56 percent, the highest since Dec. 13.  Spanish Banks  Bankia SA shares fell 14 percent after tumbling as much as
29 percent in Madrid trading.  Bankia (BKIA)  was among three Spanish
banks that had their credit ratings cut to junk by  Standard &
Poor’s  on May 25, with the company citing Spain’s weakening
economy. The nation is considering injecting debt issued by the
government or its bank-rescue fund instead of cash into the
lender, an economy ministry spokesman said.  Greece’s New Democracy, which supports the European Union’s
aid plan, ranked first in all six opinion polls published two
days ago as campaigning continued before next month’s election.
The Stoxx Europe 600 index of shares was little changed after
rising as much 0.9 percent. The euro strengthened 0.2 percent to
$1.2537.  German  two-year yields  fell as much as two basis points to
an all-time low of 0.027 percent. Five-year yields slipped to a
record 0.419 percent, and 10-year yields dropped one basis point
to 1.36. They fell to 1.351 percent on May 24, the least ever.  Italy ’s  two-year note  fell for a second day, pushing the
yield up 23 basis points to 3.92 percent. The 10-year yield
climbed seven basis points to 5.74 percent.  Italian Sentiment  Italy’s manufacturing-sentiment index dropped to 86.2, the
lowest since August 2009, from a revised 89.1 in April, the
national statistics institute said. Economists predicted a
reading of 88.6, according a Bloomberg News survey.  The nation sold 3.5 billion euros of zero-coupon notes due
in May 2014 at an average yield of 4.037 percent, compared with
3.355 percent at the previous auction on April 24. Investors bid
for 1.66 times the amount on offer, down from a so-called bid-
to-cover ratio of 1.8. Italy also auctioned 751 million euros of
inflation-linked debt.  Italian securities were the most volatile  government bonds 
in euro-area markets today, followed by Spain’s, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps.  The  European Central Bank  said today it didn’t make any
government bond purchases for an 11th week.  Treasury 10-year futures fell 0.1 percent to 133 23/32.  German debt has returned 2.1 percent this month, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italian securities have slipped
0.9 percent and Spanish debt dropped 2.9 percent.  -- Editors:  Paul Dobson , Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporters on this story:
