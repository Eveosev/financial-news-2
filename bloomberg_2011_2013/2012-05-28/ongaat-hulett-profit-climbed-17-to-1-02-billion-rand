Illovo Sugar Ltd. (ILV)  and  Tongaat Hulett
Ltd. (TON)  rose as Africa’s biggest producers of the sweetener by
market value both reported profit that beat expectations.  Illovo increased 1.4 percent, the most on a closing basis
since May 17, to 26.27 rand by the close in Johannesburg.
Tongaat climbed for the first time in seven days, adding 0.1
percent to 109.38 rand.  Illovo said today earnings per share excluding one-time
items increased 18 percent to 1.33 rand ($0.16) in the year
through March, beating the median estimate by seven analysts for
profit of 1.23 rand. Tongaat’s so-called headline earnings rose
10 percent to 8.39 rand in the year same period, versus a median
estimate of 7.32 rand a share by six analysts.  “Illovo and Tongaat received higher prices from the
European Union,” Brendan Grundlingh, an analyst at a
Johannesburg-based SBG Securities (Pty) Ltd. said by phone.  White sugar prices in the EU averaged 711 euros ($891) a
metric ton in March, the highest level since at least July 2006,
the European Commission said in a report published on its
website on May 3.  Tongaat’s sugar production increased 14 percent to 1.15
million tons, with output rising 42 percent in  Mozambique  and 12
percent in  Zimbabwe , it said. Illovo’s sugar output fell 7
percent to 1.53 million tons as drought in the KwaZulu-Natal
province and lower production in Zambia and Tanzania curbed
yields. Profit increased because of cost control, it said.  Cane increase  Tongaat, whose dividend advanced 16 percent to 2.90 rand a
share, expects output will rise as much as 25 percent in the
2012-13 season.  “The strategy to increase cane supply in South Africa is
focused on commercial farmers, small-scale farmers and
increasing Tongaat Hulett’s influence in cane development
through leasing additional land and collaborating with the
government to rehabilitate cane supply on land-reform farms that
have gone out of cane,” it said.  The government’s land-redistribution policy aims to
compensate black South Africans for the seizure of their
property under white-minority rule, which ended in 1994.  South
Africa  plans to distribute 30 percent of farmland to black
farmers by 2014.  Illovo said the 2012-13 cane crop should be a record for
the company and sugar production is expected to rise.  The company ended its involvement in the Markala sugar
project in  Mali  because of a deteriorating security situation
and the country’s uncertain political future following a March
22 coup. Illovo wrote off 173.5 million rand relating to the
Markala project, which was expected to produce 200,000 tons of
sugar and supply surplus power to the nation’s electricity grid.  Illovo will distribute 43 cents of capital for every share
held instead of paying a dividend, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
