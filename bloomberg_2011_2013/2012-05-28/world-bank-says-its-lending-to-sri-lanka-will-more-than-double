The  World Bank  said its lending to
 Sri Lanka  will more than double in the year starting July to
help spur investment and sustain  economic  expansion.  The island will receive $500 million in the period under a
recently endorsed new country partnership strategy and $527
million in the 12 months ending June 2014, Susan Razzaz, a
senior country economist at the development lender, said by
telephone from Colombo today. The country currently borrows
about $200 million annually under concessionary terms, she said.  “Sri Lanka needs to ensure it keeps growing and change the
structure of the economy for middle-income country status,”
Razzaz said. “Sri Lanka is also seeking means to increase its
exports.”  The nation has overhauled economic policy this year,
seeking to damp import demand, narrow the  trade gap  and protect
foreign reserves. The central bank predicts 7.2 percent growth
in the $50 billion economy in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
