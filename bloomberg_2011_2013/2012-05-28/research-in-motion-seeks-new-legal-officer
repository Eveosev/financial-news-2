Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , the maker of
the BlackBerry smartphone, is seeking a new chief legal officer
to replace Karima Bawa, the latest senior executive to announce
their departure in under a week.  Bawa, who has been at RIM for 12 years, has been in talks
with the company about her retirement “for some time,” the
Waterloo, Ontario-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. She plans to stay on to support the hiring and
transition once a replacement has been named.  Bawa is the second recent high-profile departure from the
company as it struggles to reverse tumbling sales as consumers
increasingly opt for devices like  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone or
handsets built on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android platform. Patrick Spence, RIM’s head of sales and one of the original staff to
promote and market the device to banks on  Wall Street , left the
company last week after 14 years.  RIM’s share of the global smartphone industry fell by more
than half to 6.4 percent last quarter, according to research
firm IDC. Android’s share jumped to 59 percent, and Apple’s iOS
operating system accounted for 23 percent.  RIM rose 0.4 percent to close at C$11.39 in Toronto. The
stock has lost 74 percent of its value in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
