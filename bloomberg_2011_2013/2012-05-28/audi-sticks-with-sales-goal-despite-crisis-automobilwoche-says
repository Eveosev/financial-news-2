Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi unit is sticking
with its goal of selling more vehicles this year than last even
as  Europe ’s debt crisis hurts some markets,  Automobilwoche  said,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler.  Audi will at least match last year’s vehicle-sales total in
2012 and aims to sell an additional 100,000 units, Stadler is
reported as saying in a preview of an interview to be published
tomorrow. The brand still plans to lift sales to 2 million autos
by 2020 from 1.3 million last year, Automobilwoche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
