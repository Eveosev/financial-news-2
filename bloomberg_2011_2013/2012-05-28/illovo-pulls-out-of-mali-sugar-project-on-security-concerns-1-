Illovo Sugar Ltd. (ILV) ,  Africa ’s largest
sugar producer, said it has ended its involvement in the Markala
sugar project in Mali because of incomplete funding and a
deteriorating security situation in the West African nation.  The project involves the development of a plantation that
would produce 190,000 metric tons of sugar and 15 million liters
of ethanol a year, according to the United Nations food agency.
The government was expected to contribute about $240 million to
develop the agricultural component of the project, while private
companies would spend about $300 million on an industrial
component, including a sugar mill and ethanol plant, the Rome-
based Food and Agricultural Organization said on its website.  The government’s failure to provide concessional funding
and meet its other obligations “together with the deteriorating
security situation in  Mali  and the country’s uncertain political
future have increased the project risks,” Mt. Edgecombe, South
Africa-based Illovo said in a stock exchange filing today. “The
group’s investment in pre-project expenditure associated with
this project totaling 173.5 million rand ($21 million) has been
fully impaired and written off.”  Soldiers ousted Malian President Amadou Toure on March 22
because of discontent about the resources that the government
was dedicating to fight Touareg rebels in the nation’s northern
region.  The Markala project is situated 275 kilometers (171 miles)
north of the Malian capital, Bamako.  To contact the reporter on this story:
