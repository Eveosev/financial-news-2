OAO Novatek fell for the first time
in three days after  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  reduced the weight of  Russia ’s
second-biggest natural gas producer in its 10/40 index,
according to Troika Dialog.  The shares retreated 0.3 percent to 301.55 rubles by the
close in Moscow. The benchmark Micex Index rose 0.7 percent to
1,290.72.  Novatek’s weighting fell to 4.5 percent from more than 9
percent, Troika said, citing MSCI’s data. The stock will see
about $700 million in outflows as a result of the change, Troika
said by e-mail today. The amended index weight will come into
effect May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
