Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer by market value, named Paul Manduca as chairman to
replace Harvey McGrath, who oversaw the company’s failed $35.5
billion bid for  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  two years ago.  Manduca, 60, who was chief executive officer of  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) ’s European asset management unit from 2002 to 2005, will
start on July 2, the London-based insurer said in a statement
today. As Prudential’s senior independent director, he had been
leading the search for a chairman until he was asked to become a
candidate, the company said.  McGrath, 60, had been pressed to step down by investors
including  Schroders Plc (SDR)  and  Jupiter Fund Management Plc (JUP)  after
the failure of the bid for AIA,  American International Group
Inc. (AIG) ’s Asian business. About 22 percent of shareholders opposed
his re-election or abstained at a vote last year after the bid
cost Prudential 377 million pounds ($591 million) in fees to
lawyers and advisers.  Manduca will step down as chairman of  Aon Corp. (AON) ’s U.K.
division to make Prudential his main focus, the firm said. The
company will appoint a replacement senior independent director
in due course.  Manduca, who was founding CEO of  Threadneedle Asset
Management Ltd ., will be paid 600,000 pounds a year, 20 percent
more than McGrath received in salary last year. The appointment
has been approved by the  Financial Services Authority ,
Prudential said.  Prudential Plc has no relation to Newark, New Jersey-based
Prudential Financial Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
