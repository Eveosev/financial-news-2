The zloty appreciated following its
fourth consecutive weekly loss as Greek opinion polls showed
growing support for parties backing a bailout plan.  The zloty gained 0.5 percent to 4.3443 per euro as of 11:28
a.m. in Warsaw. It pared this month’s loss to 3.9 percent, the
second-steepest among more than 20 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Greece ’s New Democracy placed first in all six opinion
polls published on May 26 as campaigning continued for the
general election on June 17. The zloty hit a four-month low May
16 on concern Greece will abandon the euro. The decline prompted
the  Finance Ministry  to say it was converting foreign currencies
from the European Union funds on the market.  The opinion polls “should help boost the zloty slightly in
the short-term, but the impact is likely to be temporary,”
 Piotr Kalisz , chief economist at Citigroup Inc.’s Bank Handlowy
SA unit in Warsaw wrote in an e-mailed note. “It’s hard to
assess to what extent the return of optimism will be sustainable
as we still have several weeks to go before the Greek
election.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
