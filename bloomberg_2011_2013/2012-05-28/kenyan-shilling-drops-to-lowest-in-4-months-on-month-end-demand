Kenya ’s shilling dropped to a four-
month low as demand for dollars to settle month-end obligations
outweighed the central bank’s efforts to support the currency by
curbing  money supply .  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.4 percent to 85.70 per dollar and was trading 0.1
percent weaker at 85.50 by 2:31 p.m., the lowest since Jan 26,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has
weakened for three days.  “The shilling weakening streak is largely on account of
end-month obligations from businesses,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head
of trading at Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said in
a phone interview.  Kenya accepted all 8.05 billion shillings ($50.3 million)
of bids it received for  repurchase agreements  at a weighted
average rate of 17.73 percent, said a central bank official, who
declined to be named in line with policy. The bank had offered 9
billion shillings of the seven-day securities, the official
said.  Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.3 percent to 1,585 to the
dollar and the Ugandan shilling appreciated 0.2 percent to
2,476.05 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
