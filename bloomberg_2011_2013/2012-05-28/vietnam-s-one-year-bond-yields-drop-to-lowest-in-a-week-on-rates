Vietnam ’s one-year government bonds
rose, driving yields to a one-week low, after the central bank
cut  interest rates  for the third straight month to bolster
economic growth. The dong gained.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam lowered its refinancing rate to
12 percent from 13 percent with effect from today, according to
a May 25 statement on its website. It reduced the so-called
repurchase and discount rates by one percentage point to 11
percent and 10 percent, respectively. The  inflation  rate dropped
to a 21-month low of 8.34 percent in May.  “Most of the macroeconomic indicators are indicating that
Vietnam’s economy is on its way to stabilization, which supports
bond-price appreciation,” Le Nguyet Anh, research manager at Ho
Chi Minh City-based ACB Securities Co., wrote in a note today. A
further easing of inflation next month may allow policy makers
to cut rates again, she wrote.  The  yield  on one-year government notes fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.84 percent, the lowest
level in a week, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The yield on five-year bonds was little changed at
9.68 percent.  The dong rose 0.2 percent to 20,827 per dollar as of 1:45
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828 today, according
to its website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
