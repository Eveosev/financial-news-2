Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africa’s biggest mobile phone company, fell to the lowest level
in almost a week after an Algerian court rejected an appeal by
the company’s local unit and upheld a $1.3 billion fine.  Shares of Cairo-based Orascom dropped 3.1 percent to 3.10
Egyptian pounds, the lowest intraday level since May 22, at
11:29 a.m. in the capital. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30 Index (EGX30) 
retreated 0.3 percent.  An Algerian appeals court confirmed a March 28 judgment by
the Algerian Court of First Instance against Djezzy for
violating foreign exchange regulations. The Algiers court
suspended a two-year sentence against Chief Executive Officer
Tamer El Mahdi and asked the company to pay a fine of 6 billion
dinars ($79 million) on his behalf.  Orascom said the Algerian unit is taking steps to file an
appeal with the country’s  Supreme Court .  To contact the reporter on this story:
