Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest turbine maker, won local approval for its turbine
factory in Kent, subject to an agreement related to jobs.  Vestas last May said it bought an option on 70 hectares
(173 acres) of land at Sheerness, a port southeast of  London , to
build  a plant  to make its biggest turbine which would create
2,000 jobs.  Councilors at Swale Borough Council approved the
applications made by Vestas at a meeting on May 24. The approval
is subject to an amendment which requires agreement between
Vestas, councilors and planning officers regarding the
percentage of jobs for Swale and Kent residents, according to a
statement today from Swale Borough Council.  If an agreement is reached, applications can be approved
and sent to the secretary of state for final permission,
according to the statement.  The plant will be one of the largest of its type in  Europe ,
according to  documents  from Vestas on the Swale Council website.
The V164 7-megawatt turbine will be supplied to U.K. offshore
wind sites being developed under a government plan to boost
turbines at sea, as well as other European markets, according to
the website.  “Vestas appreciate the work done by the planning committee
and the support by the local community, and we are happy that
the planning permission has been approved,” spokesman Kasper
Ibsen Beck said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
