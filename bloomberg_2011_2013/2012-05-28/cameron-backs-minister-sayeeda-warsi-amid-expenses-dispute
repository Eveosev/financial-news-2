Prime Minister  David Cameron  backed
Sayeeda Warsi, co-chairwoman of the  Conservative Party  and a
member of his Cabinet, amid allegations that she claimed an
accommodation allowance while staying with a friend rent-free.  Warsi had not offered to resign following the report
published in the Sunday Times newspaper yesterday, Cameron’s
spokeswoman Vickie Sheriff said. Warsi today asked Paul Kernaghan, the House of Lords standards commissioner, to
investigate the accusation, his office said.  “Yes, he has full confidence in Baroness Warsi,” Sheriff
told reporters in London today. “She is happy to cooperate with
any investigation.”  Warsi says she made an “appropriate payment” to a friend,
Conservative Party official Naweed Khan, for the nights she
stayed at his  London  apartment. Khan supported the assertion,
although the owner of the property, Wafik Moustafa, said he
hadn’t received money from Warsi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
