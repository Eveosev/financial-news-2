Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
fell for a fourth week in  New York , its longest losing streak
since November, as the Israeli drug maker’s guidance cut spurred
Piper Jaffray & Co. to recommend investors avoid the shares.  American depositary receipts of the world’s largest generic
drug maker slid 0.7 percent to trade at the biggest discount
versus its Tel Aviv shares in a week after Piper Jaffray and
Exane BNP Paribas cut price estimates on the shares. Teva shares
lost 1.8 percent at the close in Tel Aviv today. The  Bloomberg
Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the most traded companies in New York
added 0.8 percent last week, snapping a four-week decline.
 Partner Communications Co. (PTNR)  headed for the biggest monthly drop
on record while Allot Communications Ltd. advanced.  Teva, which brought in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s Jeremy Levin as chief executive officer after shares tumbled the most
in five years in 2011, reduced last week its guidance for 2012
earnings by at least 18 cents per share. First-quarter revenue
trailed analysts’ estimates because of sluggish sales from
 Europe , where governments have been slowing or cutting spending
on health care as economies struggle.  “Some investors just don’t see the need to own it anymore
when there’s a pathway that looks like they’ll see a lot of
short-term struggles,” Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward
Jones & Co., said by phone from  St. Louis  on May 25. “There’s
weakness in the U.S. sales, weakness in Europe and Dr. Levin is
talking about more slowdown.”  Price Cuts  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index has fallen 0.2 percent
in 2012, compared with a loss of 2.4 percent for  Israel’s TA-25 (TA-25) 
Index, which gained 0.9 percent today.  ADRs of Teva fell to $38.61 in New York last week, swelling
the discount to 76 cents versus the  Tel Aviv  shares. The shares
declined to 149 shekels today, or the equivalent of $38.59.  Teva’s price target was lowered from $45 to $44 a share on
May 25 by  David Amsellem , an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “Though
Teva shares in recent weeks have clearly reacted to the coming
downward revisions, we would continue to avoid the shares,”
Amsellem wrote in an e-mailed report dated May 25.  Exane BNP Paribas also reduced its forecast, cutting the
price target by 5 percent to $52 on “softer” European sales,
according to a report dated May 24.  Teva expects no growth from Europe, its second-largest
customer, this year, Levin, who assumed his role as chief
executive officer this month, said during a conference call last
week.  Forecast  Earnings excluding some items will be between $5.30 and
$5.40 a share in 2012, compared with a previous estimate of
$5.48 to $5.68 a share. Sales may amount to between $20 billion
and $21 billion, instead of the $22 billion his predecessor
Shlomo Yanai announced last year.  The drug maker said May 9 that first-quarter sales rose 25
percent to $5.1 billion, compared with the median estimate of
$5.5 billion from 21 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Partner,  Israel ’s second-largest mobile phone provider,
tumbled 18 percent to $4.46 in New York, extending its monthly
decline to 40 percent, the most on record. The company’s  Tel
Aviv shares  rose 3.6 percent today to 17.82 shekels, or $4.61.  The company said last week that first-quarter net income
fell to 146 million shekels ($37.9 million) from 254 million
shekels in the year-earlier period, according to a filing with
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
to  Switzerland ’s, has about 60 companies trading on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, the most of any nation outside the U.S. after
 China . Israel is also home to more startup companies per capita
than the U.S.  Allot (ALLT) , an Israeli maker of networking equipment, added 9.2
percent to $23.89 in New York last week to lead gains in the
Israel-US Equity Index. The company’s Tel Aviv shares rose 1.8
percent today to 93.88 shekels, or $24.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
