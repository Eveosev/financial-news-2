Indian stocks climbed to more than a
two-week high as the rupee strengthened and Asian equities rose
after opinion polls of Greek voters allayed concern the country
will exit the euro area.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the biggest cigarette company, rose the most in
more than a week.  State Bank of India , the biggest lender, led
its peers higher.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) ,  India ’s largest truckmaker,
rallied to an almost two-week high.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 1.3 percent
to 16,433.31, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai, bound for its highest close since May 9. The
 Reserve Bank of India  Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  pledged last
week to take steps as needed to stabilize the rupee, helping it
recover from a record low on May 24, the day the government
allowed the first increase in gasoline costs in almost seven
months to curb the  budget deficit .  The rupee touched 55.0100 per dollar, the strongest level
since May 18, and the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against six major trading partners, slid for the first time in a
week as investors returned to riskier assets.  Foreign  investors  sold a net $8.6 million of local stocks
on May 24, extending this month’s sales to $177 million, data
from the market regulator show. Overseas investors turned net
sellers of local shares in April for the first time in 2012,
contributing to the rupee’s weakness. Still, their investments
of a net $8.6 billion into domestic equities so far this year is
a record for the period, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
