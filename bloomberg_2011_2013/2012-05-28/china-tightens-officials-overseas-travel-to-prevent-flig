China ’s Communist Party will boost
measures to make sure government officials don’t flee the
country or transfer money abroad, the party said on its website.  The Central Disciplinary Inspection Commission will set up
a “flight-prevention coordinating mechanism” for every
province and enhance “passport management” measures, according
to a statement on the party  website  posted May 24, citing Gan
Yisheng, vice secretary of the commission.  Beijing has stepped up efforts to ensure party loyalty and
clean up corruption after Politburo member Bo Xilai was
suspended from the body on accusations of “serious violations
of discipline,” and his wife, Gu Kailai, was taken into custody
for involvement in the murder of a British businessman. Bo’s
ouster comes ahead of a once-a-decade party leadership
transition set to begin later this year.  The government has “prevented a batch of officials from
fleeing the country” through an existing overseas travel-
registration system and supervision of cross-border fund
transfers, according to the statement, without giving details.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
