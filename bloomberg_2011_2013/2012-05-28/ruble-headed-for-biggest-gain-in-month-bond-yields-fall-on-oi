The ruble appreciated against the
dollar for the first day in four and yields on  Russia ’s
international debt fell as investor appetite for riskier assets
increased on bets  Europe ’s debt crisis will be contained.  The Russian currency gained 0.4 percent to 31.9175 per
dollar as of 4:17 p.m. in Moscow, heading for its strongest
daily advance since April 24. The country’s $3.5 billion of
Eurobonds due 2020 rose, sending the yield eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, lower to 3.979 percent.  Brent crude  climbed 0.8 percent to $107.63 per barrel after
opinion polls showed Greece’s New Democracy party, which
supports the country’s bailout plan, is in first place, a sign
Greek voters may back austerity measures. The European Union is
Russia’s largest trading partner.  “The ruble was oversold up to the moment when positive
news came from  Greece ,” Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign
exchange at Moscow-based brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp.,
said by e-mail. The Russian currency may appreciate as much as
1.3 percent to 31.50 per dollar this week, he said.  The ruble weakened 0.2 percent to 40.11 per euro and was
little changed at 35.6039 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket. Investors pared bets on the ruble weakening,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the Russian currency at
32.4248 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 32.5365 per dollar on May 25.  The cost of insuring Russian debt against nonpayment over
five years with credit default swaps was little changed at 252
basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The ruble has depreciated 7.9 percent against the dollar
since the end of April, heading for the biggest monthly loss
since September. Over the same period Brazil’s real fell 3.4
percent, India’s rupee lost 4.4 percent and  China ’s  yuan 
weakened 1 percent, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
