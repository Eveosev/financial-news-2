Tin traders probably added to wagers
that the metal will gain as the number of outstanding contracts
climbed to the highest in more than three months at the same
time as prices rose.  Open interest in London Metal Exchange tin futures climbed
by 1,129 lots, or 4.3 percent, to 27,469 contracts in the week
ended May 24, the highest level since Feb. 10, according to LME
figures. Each lot represents 5 metric tons of the metal used in
packaging or to join metals together. The benchmark contract for
three-month delivery advanced 4 percent in the period.  An increase in open interest as prices rise suggests new
long positions, or bets on higher prices, according to Macquarie
Group Ltd.  Following are changes to market open interest for both LME
members and their clients for the six biggest industrial-metals
futures traded on the exchange. The figures were compiled by the
LME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
