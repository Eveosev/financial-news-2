European Union carbon permits may
become more volatile next month because of the prospect of
intervention in the market following a review by regulators,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The review by the European Commission in Brussels will be
“the key catalyst to stir up the market as early as June,”
Konrad Hanschmidt, a New Energy Finance analyst in  London , said
today in an e-mailed note.  EU permits for December, the industry benchmark, rose 1.7
percent today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London to
7.03 euros ($8.84) a metric ton at 12:23 p.m. They’ve dropped 60
percent in the past year on concern about oversupply. The 60-day
volatility fell to 57 percent today from 79 percent on March 1,
according to ICE data compiled by Bloomberg.  “That may rise again once the market gets more political
fuel,” Hanschmidt said. “With a U.S. Senate hearing and an
extended deadline for Chinese and Indian airlines to submit data
to the EU, June could be a crucial month in the dispute between
the EU and its major trading partners on the inclusion of
aviation in the EU emissions trading system” this year.  The contract may trade in a range from 6.70 euros to 7.40
euros this week, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
