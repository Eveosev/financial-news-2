Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding
Corp. (322) ,  China ’s biggest maker of packaged food, said profit rose
61 percent as it booked gains from its alliance with  PepsiCo
Inc. (PEP)  on a provisional basis.  Net income  increased to $198 million in the first quarter
ended March 31 from $123 million a year earlier, Tingyi said in
a statement yesterday. Revenue other than from its operations,
which includes gains from a deal Tingyi signed with PepsiCo,
surged to $211 million from $25 million a year earlier.  Tingyi, which through a venture forged a partnership with
PepsiCo to make and sell its non-carbonated beverage products,
is also collaborating with other companies including for snack
foods, and plans to widen its portfolio of products. The company
expects steps by the government including an increase in wages
and reduction in some taxes will have “a stimulating effect”
on consumption.  This will “facilitate the flourishing development of the
instant food and beverage market,” Tingyi said in the
statement. “Through forming strategic alliances with its
partners, actively developing new markets, optimizing the
product mix and enhancing product research and development and
innovation, the group will create more healthy food products
that meet the demand of consumers.”  Sales Decline  Sales of the Tianjin, China-based company fell 5.2 percent
to $1.9 billion. Gross profit margin of the maker of Master Kong
noodles and ready-to-drink tea widened to 29.11 percent in the
quarter from 26.67 percent a year earlier, according to the
statement.  Shares of Tingyi fell 1.4 percent to HK$19.18 in  Hong Kong 
yesterday, before the earnings announcement. The stock has
declined 19 percent in 2012, compared with a 18 percent gain for
 Want Want China Holdings Ltd. (151) , the nation’s largest maker of
rice crackers.  Tingyi said in November it will swap a stake in its
beverage business for PepsiCo’s bottling operations in China.
Under the agreement, PepsiCo will transfer equity interests in
its bottling operations in China to Tingyi-Asahi Beverages
Holding Co. in exchange for a 5 percent stake in Tingyi-Asahi.
China’s Ministry of Commerce approved the transaction, Tingyi
Chief Financial Officer Frank Lin said March 29.  Joint Ventures  In April, a subsidiary of the company agreed to form a
joint venture with  Itochu Corp. (8001)  to make and sell snack foods,
according to the statement. This month its unit agreed with
 Prima Meat Packers Ltd. (2281)  to set up a joint venture to process
poultry and meat products.  Sales at its  instant noodle business , which accounts for
53.4 percent of total, rose 11 percent to $1.03 billion, the
company said. The gross margin of the business increased by 3.8
percentage points to 29.85 percent from a year earlier as raw
material prices declined, it said.  Revenue of its beverage business, which contributes 42.4
percent of total, declined by 22 percent to $817.5 million.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
