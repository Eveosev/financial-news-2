The Czech Republic plans to generate
50 percent of its electricity output by nuclear reactors in
2030, Hospodarske Noviny reported, citing a report commissioned
by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  The plan is counting on the completion of two new reactors
at  CEZ AS (CEZ) ’s Temelin nuclear power station as well as one new
unit at the Dukovany station, the newspaper said, citing the
report, which will serve as a basis for the government’s updated
national energy strategy plan. Renewable energy sources probably
won’t make up more than 15 percent of the country’s power
output, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
