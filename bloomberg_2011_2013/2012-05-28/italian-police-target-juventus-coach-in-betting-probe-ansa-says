Italian police ordered the arrest of
19 people and searched the home of Antonio Conte, coach of Serie
A soccer champion Juventus, as part of an international probe
into suspected match rigging, Gazzetta dello Sport said.  Among the arrested was Lazio captain Stefano Mauri, the

Cremona, where prosecutors are leading the investigation. Conte
is among several other people being probed for alleged sporting
fraud, Gazzetta said.  A spokeswoman for Turin-based Juventus couldnâ€™t immediately
