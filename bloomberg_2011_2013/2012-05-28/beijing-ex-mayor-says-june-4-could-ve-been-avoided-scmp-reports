Chen Xitong, mayor of Beijing during
China’s June 4, 1989, military crackdown on pro-democracy
activists in  Tiananmen Square , says it was a “regrettable
tragedy that could have been avoided,” the South China Morning
Post reported, citing a book of interviews with the ex-official.  Chen, who was promoted to Beijing party secretary and made
a Politburo member after the crackdown, was sentenced to 16
years in jail in 1998 on corruption charges, according to the
Morning Post.  The 81-year-old said he didn’t know much about what was
happening behind the scenes 23 years ago and was following
orders, according the newspaper, which cited a copy of
“Conversations with Chen Xitong” by Yao Jianfu, which goes on
sale on June 1 in  Hong Kong .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
