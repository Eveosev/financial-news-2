Iraq expects its wheat production to
fall this year by as much as 16 percent to 1.5 million metric
tons because of a drought, forcing it to boost imports to 3
million tons, said Grain Board Director General Hassan Ibrahim.  “Unfortunately, there is a drought this year in the
northern provinces,” Ibrahim said in an interview in  Baghdad .
“Last year production was around 1.78 million tons. This year
we expect it to be between 1.5 and 1.6 million tons.”  Iraq consumes 4.5 million tons of wheat and 1.25 million
tons of rice a year, he said.  The government is planning tenders to import 50,000 tons of
wheat this week and 30,000 tons of rice next week, he said.
“Wheat prices are suitable. World wheat production is
abundant.”  The government is buying wheat from farmers at 720,000
dinars ($618) a ton, more than double international prices, in
an effort to reduce dependence on imports, he said.  The nation has diversified the origins of the rice it is
importing to include Argentina, Uruguay and  Thailand  in addition
to the U.S., he said. U.S. rice prices are the “highest,”
according to Ibrahim.  To contact the reporters on this story:
