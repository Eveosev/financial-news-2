The Philippine peso rose the most in
almost two months as Greek opinion polls showed parties in favor
of supporting the European bailout gaining support among voters,
stoking investor appetite for emerging-market assets.  New Democracy  was placed first in all six opinion polls
published on May 26 as campaigning continued for next month’s
general election. The peso touched a four-month low late last
week, prompting central bank Governor Amando Tetangco to say
authorities will curb excessive currency movements if needed.  “Polls out of  Greece  are showing the more conservative
party is slightly leading, so there’s better sentiment in Asian
currencies,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange
research at  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)  in  Singapore .  The peso appreciated 0.5 percent to 43.545 per dollar in
Manila in the biggest advance since April 2, according to
Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached 43.96 on May 25, the
weakest level since Jan. 16. It may trade between 43.75 and
44.00 this week, Supaat predicted.  One-month implied volatility in the currency, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 25 basis
points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 7.25 percent. It’s up from
4.5 percent at the end of last month.  “In a period of heightened uncertainty, market
participants take on defensive stances,” Tetangco said on May
25. “This trend may continue. But when more normalcy settles,
we could see a move back to assets of emerging-market sovereigns
and corporates that have shown fair resiliency.”  The yield on the  Philippines ’ 5.75 percent bonds due
November 2021 held at 5.55 percent, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
