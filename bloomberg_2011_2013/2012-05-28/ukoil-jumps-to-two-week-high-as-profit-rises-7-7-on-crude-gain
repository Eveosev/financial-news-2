OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil company, jumped to the highest level in almost two weeks
after first-quarter profit rose.  Lukoil gained 2 percent to 1,669.30 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the highest price since May 15.  Net income grew 7.7 percent to $3.79 billion from $3.52
billion a year earlier, the Moscow based company said today in a
regulatory filing. That beat the $3.10 billion  average estimate 
of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Revenue rose 19
percent to $35.3 billion, while international sales climbed 21
percent to $29.3 billion, according to the statement. Crude  oil
prices  advanced 4.2 percent in the first three months.  “Lukoil did a nice job boosting earnings on international
exports,”  Alexei Kokin , an analyst at UralSib Capital, said by
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
