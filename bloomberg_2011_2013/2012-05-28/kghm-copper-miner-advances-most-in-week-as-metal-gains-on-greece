KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper
producer with the biggest European mine output, climbed the most
in a week as the metal advanced after Greek opinion polls showed
greater support for pro-bailout parties.  The shares jumped as much as 2.1 percent, the steepest gain
on a closing basis since May 21, and traded 1.7 percent higher
at 120.2 zloty as of 9:36 a.m. in Warsaw.  Copper for three-month delivery rose 1.2 percent to
$7,729.5 per metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  Greece ’s New Democracy, which supports the plan negotiated
with international lenders, placed first in all six opinion
polls published on May 26, easing concern that the country will
exit the euro after next month’s general election. Inventories
monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange slumped 9.4 percent
last week, falling for a seventh week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
