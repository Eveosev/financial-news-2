Romania  will raise regulated
electricity prices 5 percent by the end of June for both
households and companies, news service  Mediafax  reported today,
citing government documents it obtained.  The government will stick to a plan agreed to with the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union to free
electricity prices for corporations in stages from September
until the end of 2013, Bucharest-based Mediafax reported, citing
a memorandum with the international lenders. Household
electricity prices will be freed gradually from 2013 until 2017,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
