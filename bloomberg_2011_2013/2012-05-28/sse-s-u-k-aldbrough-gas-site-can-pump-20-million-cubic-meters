SSE Plc (SSE) ’s Aldbrough U.K. natural-gas
storage site can pump as much as 20 million cubic meters of the
fuel a day into the nation’s pipelines, according to a statement
on the company’s website.  The facility in northeast England can store 18 million
cubic meters of the fuel underground each day and has a capacity
of 164 million cubic meters of “usable space,” according to
the latest technical data, SSE said today on its website.  When fully commissioned later this year, the site will be
able to store up to 330 million cubic meters, Greg Clarke, a
spokesman for SSE in Perth,  Scotland , said by telephone. It will
be the U.K.’s largest onshore gas storage facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
