Russia said the massacre of more than
100 people in the Syrian town of Houla may be an attempt to
sabotage peace efforts, RIA Novosti  reported , citing Alexander
Pankin, the Russian deputy  United Nations  envoy.  The timing of the May 25 killings, ahead of a visit to
 Syria  by UN and Arab League special envoy  Kofi Annan , shows a
deliberate effort to undermine the former UN chief’s peace plan,
Pankin said. While the deaths were evidently caused by heavy
artillery and tank fire, many bodies were shot at close range,
he was quoted as saying by the state news service.  The Syrian government shouldn’t shoulder all the blame
because its forces didn’t enter Houla, Pankin said, according to
RIA. The massacre was in the interest of forces seeking to
provoke a full-scale armed conflict in the country, the Russian
diplomat said, adding that he didn’t rule out the involvement by
foreign intelligence services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
