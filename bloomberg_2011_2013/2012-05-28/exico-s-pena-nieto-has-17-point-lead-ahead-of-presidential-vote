Mexican presidential candidate
Enrique Pena Nieto held a wide lead over his two rivals in an
opinion poll ahead of the July 1 vote, with 36.1 percent
support.  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , from the Party of the
Democratic Revolution, had 19.5 percent support while Josefina Vazquez Mota, from the ruling  National Action Party , had 19.1
percent, Grupo Economistas Asociados-ISA reported in a survey
released yesterday.  Pena Nieto, of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party , has
maintained his polling lead even after making public blunders in
early campaigning and after thousands of students marched
against him in Mexico City earlier this month.  The survey included 1,148 people interviewed from May 25 to
May 27 and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
