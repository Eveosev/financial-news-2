Spanish 10-year bonds declined,
driving the additional yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of similar-maturity German debt to 500 basis
points for the first time since May 16.  The rate on the Spanish securities climbed nine basis
points to 6.40 percent at 8:18 a.m. London time, versus 1.38
percent for bunds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
