Chile’s peso rose for the first time
in four days as copper, its main export, rallied after concern
eased that  Greece  may leave the euro and precipitate a deeper
economic crisis in the euro region.  Copper for July delivery rose as much as 1.4 percent to
$3.4975 a pound in  New York  as six opinion polls showed Greece’s
New Democracy party, which supports the European Union bailout
plan, topping polls before elections in June. Stocks rose in
Europe and  Asia , and the euro appreciated to $1.2542 on a U.S.
holiday.  “We started off well because the opinion polls in Greece
showed the conservatives winning,” said Ronald Volpi, head of
spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA.
“With the U.S. out, there’s very little liquidity and any flow
will tend to move the dollar.”  The peso appreciated 0.2 percent to 508.65 per dollar as of
9:33 a.m. in Santiago. It earlier reached 507.30.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
increased their short peso position to $10.2 billion on May 24,
passing $10 billion for the first time since the central bank
began publishing the data in 2008. Local investors had a $17.4
billion long peso position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
