The South African National Union of
Mineworkers supports the ruling  African National Congress â€™s
proposal for a resource-rent tax for the mining industry as an
alternative to nationalizing mines, Business Day reported,
citing the union.  The additional taxes raised should be used for a sovereign
wealth fund and a state-owned mining company, the union proposed
at its national congress last week, according to the
Johannesburg-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
