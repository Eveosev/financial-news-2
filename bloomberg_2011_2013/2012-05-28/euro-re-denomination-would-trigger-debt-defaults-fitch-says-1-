A currency re-denomination for any
euro nation would lead to “multi-category” downgrades for
companies and some may voluntarily decide to default, according
to  Fitch Ratings .  While companies that regularly sell debt may find that
servicing outstanding bonds would foster  investor relations ,
those businesses may also opt for a “clean break,” analysts
John Hatton and  Richard Hunter  wrote in a report.  “Faced with a maxi-devaluation of their post-euro
currency, management may deem it preferable to take the pain of
higher new interest costs on new debt, and the initial stigma of
default, than soldier on for years under a greatly increased
leverage burden,” the analysts wrote in the report.  Opinion polls in  Greece  show that parties supporting the
European Union’s bailout agreement are gaining ground amid
warnings an exit from the currency could lead to a fragmentation
of the euro. Antonis Samaras, the leader of Greece’s New
Democracy party that backs bailout agreements, said the cost of
leaving the currency would be higher than staying in the euro.  Companies that are focused on domestic markets would have
their issuer default ratings cut to the B range or lower in the
event of a currency re-denomination, Fitch said. Distressed debt
exchanges, non-payments because of  capital controls  or
incomplete debt payments would lead to a further cut to RD or D
default ratings, according to the ratings company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
