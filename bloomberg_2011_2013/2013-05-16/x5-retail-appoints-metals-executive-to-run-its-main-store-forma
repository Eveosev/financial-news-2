X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE) , appointed Olga Naumova, an executive with experience at industrial companies,
to run Pyaterochka, the budget chain that accounts for two-thirds of revenue at  Russia ’s second-largest retailer.  The position had been vacant since Frank Mros, a former
executive of German retailer Lidl, resigned in January after
sales growth fell at X5’s discounters. Naumova previously worked
as an executive at Russian companies including steelmakers
ChelPipe and OAO Severstal, X5 said in a statement today.  The appointment of a permanent head for the discounter is
positive, while “her lack of retail experience is likely to
mute any market excitement,” Maria Kolbina, an analyst at VTB
Capital, said in a note.  Billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s X5 ceded the title of
Russia’s largest retailer by sales to faster-growing  OAO Magnit (MGNT) ,
run by billionaire Chief Executive Officer Sergey Galitskiy,
based on first-quarter results. Magnit increased sales more than
30 percent during the quarter, while X5 had 8.1 percent growth.  Stephan DuCharme was appointed as X5’s permanent CEO in
January after filling the role on an acting basis for half a
year.  X5 rose 0.2 percent to $18.13 at 2:16 p.m. in  London . The
stock has dropped 24 percent in 12 months, while Magnit advanced
113 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
