Greek businessman Achilleas Kallakis,
known on the international poker circuit as ‘The Don,’ had his
U.K. jail term for fraud increased to 11 years by an appeals
court, in a victory for prosecutors who said his sentence was
too lenient.  Kallakis and conspirator Alexander M. Williams used
“determination and audacious dishonesty to commit a commercial
fraud with international proportions,” Judge Christopher
Pitchford said in a ruling increasing the sentence.  Kallakis, 44, was imprisoned for seven years in January
when he was convicted of tricking banks including  Allied Irish
Banks Plc (ALBK)  into lending as much as 740 million pounds ($1.1
billion) and using the money to pay for trophy property, private
planes, a yacht in  Monaco , luxury cars, helicopters and artwork.  Corker Binning, the  law firm  representing Kallakis, didn’t
immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.  The Court of Appeal also took a year off the 13-year term
handed to Nicholas Levene, an investment manager jailed in 2012
after investors lost about 100 million pounds in his Ponzi
fraud.  The appellate judges, who were asked to clarify sentencing
rules for fraud-related offenses, said there wasn’t a need to
review existing guidelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
