Morgan Stanley (MS)  was sued by a
Birmingham, Alabama, medical center over claims the bank
received improper payments from  ING Life Insurance and Annuity
Co.  in exchange for referral of retirement-investment business.  The bank placed retirement plans with so-called alliance
partners, including ING, and received additional compensation
from them based on the assets invested, according to the suit
filed today in federal court in Manhattan. The compensation
amounted to a “pay-to-play” fee, prohibited by U.S. law,
according to the suit brought by Skin Pathology Associates Inc.  “The alliance partner program is structured to take
advantage of a conflict of interest Morgan Stanley has
created,” the skin-testing center said in the complaint.  The Skin Pathology alleged it hired New York-based Morgan
Stanley, the sixth-largest institutional broker in the U.S., as
a broker for the retirement plan that was placed with ING. The
center is seeking damages on behalf itself and other companies
subject to Morgan Stanley’s alliance partner program.  Morgan Stanley spokesman Akhilesh Raina declined to comment
on the lawsuit. Dana Ripley, a spokesman for ING, said he
couldn’t immediately comment.  The case is Skin Pathology Associates Inc. v. Morgan Stanley
& Co., 13-cv-3299, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
