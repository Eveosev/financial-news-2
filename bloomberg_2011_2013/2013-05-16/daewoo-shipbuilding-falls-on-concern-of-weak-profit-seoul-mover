Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co. (042660) , the world’s third-largest shipbuilder, fell the
most in 21 months in Seoul trading on concern the company may
record weaker profit.  Daewoo Shipbuilding dropped 10.5 percent, the biggest
decline since August 19, 2011, to close at 25,600 won. The
stock, the  worst performer  on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index today,
has fallen 5.7 percent this year, compared with a 0.5 percent
drop for the Kospi index.  The shipbuilder yesterday posted a 42 percent decline in
first-quarter profit. Earnings missed analysts’ estimates
because of rising costs from offshore operations, according to
E*Trade Securities Korea Co. Shipyards, including Seoul-based
Daewoo Shipbuilding and  Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140) , have
turned to contracts for drilling and floating production units
amid a slump in ship orders.  “There seemed to be an unexpected increase in costs from
its offshore operations, disappointing investors,” said Park Moo Hyun, a Seoul-based analyst at E*Trade. “The market is
worried that more costs could be incurred in these operations,
undermining earnings going forward.”  Macquarie Group Ltd. cut its recommendation on the stock to
neutral from outperform after the company’s results.  Net income ,
including minority interests, fell to 48.9 billion won ($44
million) in the first quarter. That’s less than the 88.2
billion-won average of 17 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods and
administrative expenses, slumped 53 percent to 67.3 billion won.
That cut  profitability  to 2.1 percent, compared with 4.6 percent
a year earlier.  Daewoo Shipbuilding had $23.6 billion in its order backlog
for offshore equipment at the end of April, accounting for 62
percent of total contracts, according to a statement on its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
