Sina Corp. (SINA) , owner of  China ’s largest
Twitter-like service, posted a first-quarter loss as an
advertising slowdown damped revenue and the company spent more
on developing mobile applications.  The  net loss  narrowed to $13.2 million from $13.7 million a
year earlier, the New York-listed company said in a statement
today. That compares with the $5.6 million loss, the average of
10 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 19
percent to $126 million.  Sina has boosted spending on the development of apps as the
more than 500 million users of its Weibo micro-blog service
increasingly post from mobile devices rather than personal
computers. China’s economic slowdown has also damped
advertising, crimping earnings at other Internet companies
including  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)   “Sina’s costs on development and staff is quite big,”
Deco You, a Beijing-based analyst at Internet consulting group
iResearch, said before the announcement. “The company lacks new
revenue drivers.”  The Internet company forecast second-quarter non-GAAP
revenue of $143 million to $147 million, including advertising
revenue of $117 million to $119 million. That compares with the
$144 million average of nine  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sina’s ad sales dropped 15 percent in the first quarter
from the three months ended Dec. 31 to $94.3 million, according
to the statement.  Sina sold an 18 percent stake of its Weibo unit for $586
million to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in April, as the company
tries to capture a greater share of social e-commerce through
smartphones and tablet computers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
