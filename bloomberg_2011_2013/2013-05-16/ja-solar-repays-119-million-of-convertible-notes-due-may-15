JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) , the largest
solar-cell producer by capacity, repaid $119 million in
principal and interest for bonds due yesterday.  “JA Solar is committed to meeting all of our debt
obligations and managing our balance sheet prudently to protect
the interests of our stakeholders,” Chief Executive Officer Jin Baofang said in a statement today from Shanghai-based JA Solar.  Investors are concerned other Chinese solar companies may
not make bond payments.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  defaulted on
$541 million in debt March 15, and LDK Solar Co. paid only a
portion of $23.8 million due last month. Renewable-energy
companies based in Hong Kong and  China  are scheduled to repay
$3.5 billion in debt this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  JA Solar’s American depositary receipts slipped 4.7 percent
cents to $5.45 at the close in New York. Each ADR is worth five
ordinary shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
