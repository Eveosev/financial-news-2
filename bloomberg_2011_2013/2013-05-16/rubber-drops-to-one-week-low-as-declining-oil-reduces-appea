Rubber fell to a one-week low on
speculation that decreasing oil prices would cut the cost of
synthetic products, decreasing the appeal of the natural variety.  Rubber for delivery in October dropped as much as 2.3
percent to 276.3 yen a kilogram ($2,707 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, the lowest price for the most-active
contract since May 9. Futures were at 279.9 yen at 11 a.m., set
for a third day of decline and a weekly loss of 4.7 percent.  Crude for June delivery traded at $94.02 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange after
slumping as much as 2.2 percent yesterday to the lowest level
since May 2. The Japanese currency advanced against the dollar
after data showed the world’s third-largest economy expanded
last quarter more than analysts had estimated, weakening the
appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  “A weaker oil market put a drag on rubber futures amid a
lack of support from the currency market,” Hideshi Matsunaga,
an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Japan ’s  gross domestic product  rose an annualized 3.5
percent in the first quarter, the most in a year, a Cabinet
Office report showed today in Tokyo. The median estimate of 36
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 2.7 percent gain.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.3 percent to 89.55 baht
($3.02) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  Rubber for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 19,870  yuan  ($3,231) a ton.
Inventory in Qingdao,  China ’s main hub for the commodity, fell
to 363,300 tons from record 371,100 tons on April 26, Cai Zhiwei,
general manager at the Qingdao International Rubber Exchange
Market, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
