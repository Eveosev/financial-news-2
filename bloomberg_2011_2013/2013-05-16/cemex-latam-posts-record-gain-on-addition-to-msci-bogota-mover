Cemex Latam Holdings SA (CLH) , a cement
maker in Central and South America, rose the most on record
after  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  included the company in a gauge tracked by
investment funds.  The shares advanced 3.8 percent to 13,280 pesos at 11:41
a.m. in Bogota after earlier gaining 5.3 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since the company’s Monterrey, Mexico-based
parent, Cemex SAB, sold the shares in November in an initial
public offering.  Bogota-based Cemex Latam was added to MSCI’s Colombia index
as part of a rebalancing announced yesterday, with changes due
to take effect June 3.  The addition was one of the “biggest surprises,” Banco
Santander SA analysts Stefano Rizzi and Jesus Gomez wrote in an
e-mailed report yesterday. Cemex Latam is one of three stocks
for which “we expect the largest buying pressure from passive
funds,” they wrote.  The rebalancing may create “buying pressure” on Cemex
Latam equivalent to 8.6 days of average trading volume,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
