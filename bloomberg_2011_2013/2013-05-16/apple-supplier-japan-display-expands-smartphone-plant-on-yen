Japan Display Inc., which supplies
liquid-crystal displays to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , is expanding a factory
that makes panels for smartphones and tablet computers as the
yen’s weakness helps spur overseas demand.  The company is boosting capacity of high-definition LCDs at
its plant in Chiba Prefecture, east of Tokyo, President Shuichi Otsuka said in an interview yesterday. Japan Display plans to
start the operations next month as it targets sales of as much
as 800 billion yen ($7.8 billion) this year, he said.  Japan Display, the world’s largest maker of LCDs used in
mobile devices, is trying to widen its lead by adding more
products for tablets and expanding into car dashboard displays.
The Tokyo-based company was set up last year when  Sony Corp. (6758) ,
 Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  spun off their businesses to a
government-backed fund after struggling to compete with South
Korea’s  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and Taiwan’s  Innolux Corp. (3481)  in
the TV display market.  “Our business is now on track,” said Otsuka, who
previously was the chief operating officer at Elpida Memory Inc.
“Our technology is unique, so it won’t be easy for other
companies to do the same.”  The yen touched 102.76 per dollar this week, the weakest
since October 2008. The Japanese currency has tumbled about 21
percent since November, making it the biggest loser among 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation
Weighted Indexes.  “It’s positive for our business,” Otsuka said. Every 1
yen drop in the dollar boosts Japan Display’s profit by 1.5
billion yen, he said.  New IPhone  Apple Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  told analysts last
month that new products are in the works for later this year and
through 2014, without giving details. IPhone 5S production may
start as early as late June, Jefferies Group LLC analyst  Peter Misek  said in a note this week.  Japan Display is ahead of its target with the expansion.
Sales may reach between 700 billion yen and 800 billion yen in
the year started April 1, from about 450 billion yen last fiscal
year, Otsuka said. The venture targeted sales of 750 billion yen
for the year ending March 2016, the government’s  Innovation
Network Corp. of Japan , which owns 70 percent of the company,
said in 2011.  Sharp, LG  The company plans to remain profitable, after posting an
operating margin of no more than about 1 percent last year, he
said without elaborating.  Japan  Display wants to expand sales of
displays used in cars such as instrument panels, Otsuka said.  Japan Display’s share of revenue in the global market for
small- and mid-sized LCDs was 16.6 percent in 2012, according to
NPD DisplaySearch.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  held 14.8 percent, followed by LG
Display Co.’s 13.5 percent and Innolux’s 10.2 percent, the
market researcher said.  INCJ invested 200 billion yen in Japan Display last year
for its controlling stake. Sony, Toshiba and Hitachi each own 10
percent.  The display maker, which employs about 6,200 workers, has
six factories in Japan and four overseas, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
