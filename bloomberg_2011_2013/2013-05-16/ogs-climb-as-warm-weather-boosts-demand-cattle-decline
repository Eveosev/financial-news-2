Hog futures rose, heading for the
biggest weekly advance since November, on speculation that
demand for U.S. pork will increase as warmer weather encourages
consumers to grill outdoors. Cattle prices declined.  Wholesale  pork  surged 19 percent since the end of March
to a nine-month high of 91.93 cents a pound yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Warm weather is expected to
persist over much of the central U.S. over the next 11 to 15
days, including the Memorial Day holiday on May 27, MDA Weather
Services, a forecaster based in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in
a report e-mailed today.  “We didn’t have much of a spring, and now you’re starting
to see those grills come out,”  Christian Mayer , a market
analyst with Northstar Commodity Investments in  Minneapolis ,
said in a telephone interview. “When you have weather like
that, consumption has always shown to pick up.”  Hog futures for June settlement climbed 1.4 percent to 93.2
cents a pound at 11:13 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.
A close at that price would leave the commodity up 3 percent
since May 10, heading for the biggest weekly advance for a most-active contract since Nov. 9.  Cattle futures for August delivery declined 0.3 percent to
$1.19525 a pound in Chicago. Prices through yesterday are down
9.4 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement dropped 0.3
percent to $1.4485 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
