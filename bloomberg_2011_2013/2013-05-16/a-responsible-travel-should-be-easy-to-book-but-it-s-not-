I don't know about you, but when I travel, I would like to know that I am not harming the world. I want to have some sense, for example, of my hotels' environmental and social impact. If they're bad guys, I want to know. And if they're doing cool stuff, I want to know, too. As it turns out, that's not easy to find out.  Condé Nast Traveler 's  World Savers Awards  spotlight truly exceptional travel companies that are fighting poverty, promoting education, and generally doing good. But by definition, our awards are not encyclopedic. There are a number of websites that attempt to help people make decisions about responsible travel—but after checking them out, I was disappointed. While they are all providing good information, none of them helps me if I want to know whether the Grand Hyatt Hotel in São Paolo, say, is socially responsible. (It is, by the way: It runs an amazing program for youth from the favela, and won a  2011 World Savers Award ). There's simply no comprehensive site. Here’s a rundown of what I’ve found out there: Green Traveller  lists hotels it considers to be green, but its choices seem somewhat random—there are only about 50 companies included. Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Trip  has done an amazing job of compiling a list of hotels that have been certified or recommended by "reputable organizations" (whatever that means) as environmentally responsible—but only in Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. And when I searched for two companies that do more than many others in sustainability—Sandals (check out  Sandals Earth Guard ) and GoldenEye in Jamaica (check out the  Oracabessa Foundation )—they didn't show up. Responsible Travel , which was founded with a sustainable travel mission and backing from Body Shop founder Anita Roddick, promotes trips it considers to be "responsible," but the bar seems to be set relatively low: The company requires that members answer yes or no to a number of vague criteria, such as "We free the land, sea, and waterways from rubbish and pollution" and "We recognize local issues and actively campaign to address them." Sustainable Travel International offers  The Responsible Travel Report , which lists its partners, sustainable travel companies, and has a carbon calculator that allows you to calculate the carbon emissions of your travel. But again, not comprehensive. I would love to be able to assess whether my hotel is socially responsible. For that matter, wouldn't it be fabulous if you could plan a trip, from flights to tours to hotels and transportation, and quickly learn whether you are giving your business to companies that are doing the right thing? I, for one, wish there was such a service. Do you? Would you use it? More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
