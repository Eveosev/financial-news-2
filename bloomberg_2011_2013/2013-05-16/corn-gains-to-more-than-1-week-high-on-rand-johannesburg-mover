South African corn futures rose to
the highest level in more than a week as the rand dropped
against the dollar, making imports of the locally produced grain
more expensive.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained 1.2 percent to 2,167 rand ($231) a metric ton by the
close in Johannesburg. The white variety for delivery in the
same period climbed 0.6 percent to 2,176 rand a ton.  The rand weakened 0.9 percent to 9.3661 per dollar by the
noon close of the grain-futures market in Johannesburg. The
currency has slipped for a sixth day and is headed for its
longest losing streak in a year on concern that falling
commodity prices and labor unrest at mines are threatening the
nation’s credit rating.  “Our prices were affected by the weakening rand,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes
Ltd., said by phone. “This caused an upward movement for our
local price.”  South Africa is the continent’s biggest producer of corn.
The white grain is a staple food in the country, while the
yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in July declined 0.1 percent to 3,495
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
