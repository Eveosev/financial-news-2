Police detained four men and two
women in a raid in northern  Pakistan  as they searched for the
kidnapped son of former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.  The men being held after the raid in Nowshera district were
of Afghan origin and carried fake Pakistani identity cards,
Nowshera police chief Waqar Ahmad told Geo television in a
broadcast interview.  Ali Haider Gilani was kidnapped May 9 as he campaigned in
the central city of Multan ahead of national elections two days
later in which  Nawaz Sharif ’s party won the most seats. Sharif
has pledged to tackle militancy that killed 151 people in
election-related violence.  While there was no immediate word on Gilani’s fate, he may
have been let go as his kidnappers moved to avoid capture, Ahmad
said. The kidnappers are hardened criminals who “change their
places from time to time, but we hope to have Ali with us by the
end of today,” he said.  During the raid in Nowshera, 427 kilometers (265 miles)
from Multan, police found another kidnapped person, Abdul Wahab,
who said Gilani had been held with him at one point.  “Wahab told us he met someone who identified himself as
Ali,” Ahmad told Geo. “He said this man was of Punjabi origin,
tall and his head was covered with a handkerchief. He also told
him he was the son of  Yousuf Raza Gilani  and a candidate” in
the election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
