U.K. stocks  were little changed,
after the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  yesterday rallied to its
highest level since October 2007 and completed its longest
streak of gains in almost four years.  Aviva Plc advanced the most in more than eight months after
reporting an 18 percent increase in the value of new business.
 National Grid (NG/)  Plc fell the most in a month after the owner of
Britain’s power-distribution network said U.S. storms cut
operating profit by about 136 million pounds.  The FTSE 100 Index gained 6.71 points, or 0.1 percent, to
6,700.26 at 9:58 a.m. in  London . The equity benchmark completed
the longest streak of gains since July 2009 yesterday, and has
 surged 14 percent  this year as central banks maintained stimulus
measures. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also added 0.1
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.3 percent.  “As long as the stimulus keeps coming, then you’ve got to
be in there,” Lucy Macdonald, chief investment officer for
equities at Allianz Global Investors in London, told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television. “Although there’s certainly a
bubbly feeling occurring, when you look at the absolute
valuations against history, they’re not wildly out of line.”  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
was 19 percent higher than the average of the past 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. Housing  In the U.S., Britain’s biggest trading partner, housing
starts fell to a 970,000 annual rate in April, after jumping in
March to a 1.04 million pace,  economists  said before a report.

 Washington .  Aviva (AV/)  rose 4.5 percent to 337.6 pence. The value of new
business rose to 191 million pounds ($290 million) in the first
quarter, from 162 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based insurer said.  Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG)  jumped 7.9 percent to 156.1 pence,
the highest price in two years. The U.K. tour operator said it
plans to refinance 1.6 billion pounds as it seeks to extend the
maturity of its debt and cut borrowings.  National Grid lost 1.8 percent to 829 pence. U.S. storms
including  Hurricane Sandy  cut operating profit by about 136
million pounds, the company said. That compares to an initial
November forecast of as much as 100 million pounds, before the
February snow storm known as Nemo.  Synthomer (SYNT)  Plc tumbled 10 percent to 201.7 pence after the
maker of nitrile latex said demand in  Europe  was weaker in March
and April than forecast, and it remains “cautious” about the
outlook for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
