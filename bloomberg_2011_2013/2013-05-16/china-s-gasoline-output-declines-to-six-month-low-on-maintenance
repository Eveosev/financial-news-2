China ’s gasoline output fell to the
lowest level in six months in April as refineries shut
processing units for maintenance. Production of diesel and
natural gas declined from March while crude was little changed.  China, the world’s second-biggest crude consumer, produced
7.76 million metric tons of  gasoline  in April, data today from
the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics show. That’s
equivalent to 2.19 million barrels a day, the lowest rate since
October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The nation typically shuts refineries this time of year for
maintenance before the peak summer demand season.  Oil refining 
by companies including China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. and
PetroChina Co. dropped to 9.36 million barrels a day last month,
the lowest volume since August, data from the the statistics
bureau showed May 13.  “The low gasoline output is mainly because of low crude-processing from maintenance,” Jean Zou, an oil analyst at ICIS
C1 Energy, a Shanghai-based commodities researcher, said by
phone. “As major refineries’ operating rates pick up in May,
gasoline output should rebound.”  China’s 83 biggest refineries shut 2.02 million tons of
crude-processing capacity for maintenance in April, according to
C1. That compares with an average of 1.38 million a month in
2012. The nation had a total annual capacity of 575 million tons
last year, China National Petroleum Corp., the country’s biggest
oil company, said in a report Jan. 30.  Gasoline demand will increase 11.6 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier to 22.93 million tons, Xinhua News
Agency’s China Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals newsletter reported May
1, citing research by CNPC.  China’s diesel output in April was 13.82 million tons, or
3.46 million barrels a day, down from 3.59 million a day in
March, today’s data showed. The nation pumped 17.15 million tons
of  crude , or 4.19 million barrels a day, compared with 4.18
million a day the prior month. Gas production was 9.21 billion
cubic meters, down from 9.93 billion in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
