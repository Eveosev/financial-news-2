Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  Chief Executive
Officer Michael O’Leary said he’s in talks about adding routes
to seven more Spanish airports.  Potential for growth in the Spanish market, where Ryanair
serves 23 locations, would increase if airports operator Aena
cut fees, to the benefit of local carriers Iberia Express and
Vueling SA, as well as the Irish company, O’Leary said.  The Ryanair chief predicted that  International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA (IAG)  will “gradually close” Iberia’s European
mainline operations over the next few years as discount
specialist Vueling, which London-based IAG is buying, expands
operations beyond its Barcelona base to the Madrid hub.  Ryanair has no plans for flights between the Spanish and
Catalan capitals, the CEO said.  Europe’s No. 1 discount operator will consider the Boeing
Co. 737-7 Max model as it seeks to add more planes, O’Leary said
in the interview in  Madrid .  The 737-7 variant, which won its first order -- from
Southwest Airlines Co. -- yesterday, is smaller than the 737-800
around which Ryanair’s fleet is currently based.  To contact the reporter on this story:
