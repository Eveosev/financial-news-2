John Surma, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of U.S. Steel Corp., the country’s biggest
producer of the metal, said domestic demand won’t reach pre-recession levels before 2015 as construction spending
languishes.  The 2.7 percent increase in U.S. steel use in 2013 that’s
forecast by the World Steel Association will bring consumption
to only 92 percent of 2007’s level, the year before the
financial crisis and collapse in commodity prices, Surma said.  “We’re still not quite there,” he said in a May 13
interview in Leipsic,  Ohio .  U.S. spending on  construction  has slumped to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $856.7 billion in March, the lowest
since August, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census
bureau. Industrywide steelmaking capacity utilization in the
U.S. was at 79 percent for the week ending May 7, according to
American Iron and Steel Institute  data . The rate exceeded 90
percent in the first half of 2008.  Surma has sold an unprofitable Serbian steel mill and
expanded into higher-margin products as he tries to improve
performance at the Pittsburgh-based company, which has posted a
loss in the past two quarters. He was in Ohio on May 13 for the
commissioning of a $400 million  production line  at Pro-Tec, a
50-50 joint venture with  Japan ’s  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)  The new line
will produce 500,000 tons a year of coated, heat-treated steel
for automotive customers.  U.S demand for finished steel products will increase 2.7
percent this year to 99.3 million tons, according to U.S. Steel,
which cites data from the Brussels-based  World Steel
Association . Demand was 108.3 million tons in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
