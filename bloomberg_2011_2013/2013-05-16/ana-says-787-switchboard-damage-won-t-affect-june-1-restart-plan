ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) , operator of a
fleet of  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 jets grounded since January after
batteries overheated, said a switchboard was damaged by heat on
a 787 training flight after a nut was not fully tightened.  The part was replaced and the Tokyo-based carrier will
finish plane and pilot tests on schedule, Yoichi Uchida, an ANA
spokesman, said by phone today. The scheduled June 1 restart for
commercial 787 flights is unchanged, Uchida said.  The damage was discovered after a flight to Sapporo from
 Tokyo  on May 4 and wasn’t related to the lithium-ion battery
system, Uchida said. ANA, which operates the world’s largest
fleet of 17 787 Dreamliners, is implementing Boeing battery
repairs approved by the  Federal Aviation Administration  and
Japan’s transport ministry to allow the restart of flights.  Boeing’s 787, the world’s first plastic-composite airliner,
was grounded in January after two battery overheating incidents.  The Dreamliner is safe to fly, even as the cause of the
battery meltdowns remains uncertain, Mike Sinnett, vice
president and chief project engineer of the 787 program, said
last month. Stress testing of Chicago-based Boeing’s redesigned
system showed its steel casing and heat vent reduced battery
overheating, he said.  ANA last week placed advertisements in Japanese newspapers
to lure customers back to the aircraft as it prepares to restart
flights after a more than four-month halt in commercial
operations.  Japan Airlines Co. (9201) , the world’s second-largest
Dreamliner operator, will resume 787 flights the same day.  ANA rose 2.8 percent to 220 yen as of the close in Tokyo
trading today and has gained 22 percent this year, compared with
a 45 percent jump in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. JAL fell 1.3
percent to 4,900 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
