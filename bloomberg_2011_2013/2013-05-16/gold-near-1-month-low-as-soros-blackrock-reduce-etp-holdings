(Corrects to remove reference to Farallon in seventh
paragraph. For more on the gold  bear market , see EXT5.)  Gold futures fell, capping the
longest slump in 16 months, as U.S. filings showed that  George Soros  and  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  cut stakes in exchange-traded products
backed by the metal, signaling waning investment demand.  Soros Fund Management LLC lowered its holding in the SPDR
Gold Trust, the biggest such fund, by 12 percent as of March 31
from the previous quarter, data showed yesterday. The World Gold
Council said today that demand dropped 13 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier as ETP sales outweighed a surge in
purchases of coins, bars and jewelry in  China  and India.  “There has been heavy fund selling in the past few days,
and we continue to see this rotation out of precious metals,”
 Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “We’re not
seeing a runaway recovery, but we’re getting growth and little
inflation, so the reasons for the original run-up in gold are
fading away.”  Gold futures for June delivery dropped 0.7 percent to close
at $1,386.90 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
price fell for the sixth straight session, the longest slump
since December 2011. Earlier, the metal touched $1,368, the
lowest for a most-active contract since April 18.  Dollar, Equities  Gold has dropped 17 percent this year, tumbling into a bear
market last month, as some investors lost faith in the metal as
a store of value, while the  dollar  rose 5 percent against a six-currency basket. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities
climbed to a record yesterday.  Holdings in the SPDR fund yesterday fell 0.4 percent to
1,047.13 metric tons, the lowest since March 2009. They have
declined 303.7 tons this year.  Soros Fund Management  cut its
stake in the fund by 55 percent in the fourth quarter.  In the first quarter, Paulson & Co., the largest investor
in SPDR, maintained its stake of 21.8 million shares, while
funds run by Northern Trust and BlackRock had reductions of more
than half. Schroder Investment Management Group bought shares.  Holdings in global gold ETPs have dropped 16 percent this
year, according to Bloomberg data.  Silver futures for July delivery rose less than 0.1 percent
to $22.659 an ounce. Earlier, the metal touched $22.06, the
lowest since April 16. The price has slumped 25 percent this
year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery dropped 0.3 percent to $1,485.60 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose 1.6 percent to
$740.75 an ounce. The price gained for the fourth straight
session, the longest rally since March 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
