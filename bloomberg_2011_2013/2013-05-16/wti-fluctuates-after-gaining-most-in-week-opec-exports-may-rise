West Texas Intermediate crude headed
for the first weekly decline in a month after U.S. consumption
of gasoline and distillate fuels dropped.  Futures fluctuated in  New York  after rising yesterday by
the most in six days. U.S. gasoline consumption shrank 1.2
percent last week and demand for distillate fuels, including
heating oil and diesel, decreased 2.4 percent, Energy Department
data show. WTI may drop next week amid concern that weaker
economic growth will reduce fuel use, according to a Bloomberg
News survey.  “We still expect renewed downside pressure,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in  London , said in an e-mail. “Demand is yet to improve ahead of summer” in the U.S.
and  Europe , he said.  WTI for June delivery was at $95.35 a barrel, up 19 cents,
in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
10:27 a.m. London time. The volume of all contracts traded was
1.8 percent below the 100-day average. Prices rose 86 cents to
$95.16 yesterday, the highest close since May 13. They are down
0.7 percent this week.  Brent for July settlement rose 28 cents to $104.08 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European
benchmark crude was at a premium of $8.45 to WTI futures for the
same month, down from $8.64 yesterday. The spread closed at
$9.38 on May 15, the widest since April 26.  Moving Average  Eighteen of 35 analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast WTI will drop through May 24. Seven respondents, or 20
percent, predicted a gain. Ten said there would be little
change. Last week, 46 percent of analysts projected a decline.  WTI’s 200-day moving average is around $92.21 a barrel
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The indicator is
near the lowest price traded so far this week, signaling it’s a
technical-support level where buy orders may be clustered.  “The bottom end of the range is defined by that 200-day
moving average, which is currently at around $92.20,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. “The
market will struggle to get through that $98 to $100 range
without a significant event that causes some sort of supply
shortage to emerge in the  Middle East .”  U.S. gasoline consumption fell last week to 8.34 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since March 15, according to the
report from the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistics unit, on
May 15. Demand for distillate fuels, including heating oil and
diesel, decreased to 3.58 million.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
forecast to boost crude exports this month to meet rising demand
in  Asia . The group will ship 23.87 million barrels a day of
crude in the four weeks ending June 1, up from 23.65 million in
the previous period to May 4, Oil Movements, a tanker tracker,
said in a report yesterday.  Middle East shipments will gain 1.2 percent to 17.54
million barrels a day, compared with 17.33 million during the
month to May 4, according to Oil Movements. The figures exclude
Angola and  Ecuador  and include non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
