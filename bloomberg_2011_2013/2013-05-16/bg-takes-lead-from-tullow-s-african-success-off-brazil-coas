(Corrects company name in penultimate paragraph.)  BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-largest energy producer, is stepping up exploration off Brazil
as part of a plan to add as much as 1 billion barrels of global
resources a year.  BG agreed to pay $200 million for 10 exploration licenses
in the Barreirinhas Basin at the latest auction in Brazil, said
Kim Blomley, a spokesman for the Reading, England-based company.
It owns six of them and has a partnership with Petroleo
Brasileiro SA and Galp Energia SGPS SA regarding four blocks off
the northern coastline.  “It’s similar to  Africa ’s Ghana Cretaceous play” where
Tullow Oil Plc is producing at the Jubilee field, Blomley said
by phone. “If you look at the tectonic plates you can see how
they connect.”  Tullow has been drilling on both sides of the Atlantic
Ocean in an effort to prove that African and South American
fields mirror each other from when the continents split apart
from Gondwanaland millions of years ago.  BG plans to spend as much as $1.8 billion a year through
2015 on exploration to boost resources, Chief Executive Officer
Chris Finlayson said May 14.  Together with Petrobras and Galp, BG has discovered
 Brazil ’s largest oil fields, Lula and Iara, at the BM-S-11 block
in the pre-salt geology in the Santos Basin. BG is now examining
plans to expand development of the two fields, Finlayson said.  The partners aim to repeat the joint venture’s success at
the new blocks, Blomley said. “It’s a new basin.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
