Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  lowered its
assessment of a radioactive water leak at the crippled Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant to about a large bucket from an initial estimate
of a medium-sized swimming pool.  About 20 liters of radioactive water is estimated to have
leaked into the soil, out of approximately 300 liters that
escaped into waterproof sheets that lined the underground No. 2
storage pool, Tokyo Electric said yesterday in a statement. The
utility earlier said about 120,000 liters of water may have
leaked from the pool.  The No. 2 pit is among three storage pools where the
company, known as Tepco, found leaks of radioactive water after
a quake and tsunami in March 2011 crippled power and cooling
systems at the nuclear plant, causing three meltdowns and
radiation leaks into the air and the ocean. The quantity of
water that leaked from the other two pits is estimated to be
less than the No. 2 unit, Tepco said yesterday.  “We will not easily discharge water” into the ocean,
President Naomi Hirose said yesterday at a press conference in
Fukushima and broadcast on the company’s website. The utility
will continue to cooperate with the government and the country’s
nuclear-safety regulator to find ways to resolve the radioactive
water issue, Hirose said.  An erroneous water gauge was responsible for the previous
high estimate, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
