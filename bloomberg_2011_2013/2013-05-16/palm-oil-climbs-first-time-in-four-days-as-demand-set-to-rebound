Palm oil  advanced for the first time
in four days on speculation that demand for the world’s most
consumed vegetable oil may increase ahead of the Muslim fasting
month of Ramadan.  The contract for July delivery, the most active by open
interest, gained 1.1 percent to end the morning session at 2,322
ringgit ($772) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives.
The August-delivery contract, the largest by volume, rose 0.9
percent to 2,317 ringgit.  “With the festival season ahead, specially Ramadan,
stockists will slowly start buying now at these levels,”
Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz Risk Management
Services Pvt., said by phone from Mumbai. “Exports may pick up
toward the end of the month, easing inventories. A weaker
ringgit is also supporting prices.”  Consumption usually rises during Ramadan, boosting
purchases from the  Middle East  to South Asia including India,
the world’s biggest buyer. During the festival, communal meals
help to raise overall consumption. Reserves in Malaysia fell 11
percent to 1.93 million tons in April, the lowest level since
June and down from a record 2.63 million tons in December, the
nation’s Palm Oil Board said May 10.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 1.6 percent
to 6,048  yuan  ($984) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while  soybean oil  increased 1 percent to 7,404 yuan. On the
Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for July delivery rose 0.2
percent to $14.1575 a bushel and soybean oil for same month
advanced 0.4 percent to 49.53 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
