Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) ,
 Switzerland ’s biggest insurer, said first-quarter profit dropped
7 percent after investment returns declined.  Net income fell to $1.06 billion from $1.14 billion in the
year-earlier period, the Zurich-based insurer said today in a
statement. That missed the $1.14 billion average  estimate  of 10
 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. The shares dropped.  Insurers are struggling in the face of low  interest rates 
and Zurich Insurance reported a decline in operating profit at
its property and casualty business, which generates most of its
sales.  Allianz SE (ALV) ,  Europe ’s largest insurer, said yesterday
first-quarter profit rose 24 percent to 1.71 billion euros ($2.2
billion) as higher prices pushed revenue to a record.  “I’ve seen better quarters,” said Daniel Bischof a
Zurich-based analyst with Helvea. “General insurance was the
biggest miss and Zurich disappointed compared to its peers.”  Zurich Insurance fell as much as 4.6 percent, the biggest
intraday decline in more than a month, and was down 3.6 percent
at 260.60 Swiss francs as of 9:09 a.m. in Swiss trading. That
pared this year’s gain to 15 percent and valued the company at
38.8 billion francs ($40 billion).  Challenging Environment  Operating profit from general insurance dropped 6 percent
to $807 million after tripling in the year-earlier quarter. The
unit was reorganized last year and has toughened controls in
 emerging markets  to avert a repeat of a $680 million write-off
in  Germany  last year.  “We continue to operate in a challenging economic
environment with persisting low interest rates against which we
have posted strong, high quality underlying profits,” Chief
Executive Officer Martin Senn said in the statement. “We remain
on track to deliver our 2013 targets.”  Total investment returns declined to 0.4 percent during the
quarter from 2 percent in the year-earlier period amid
“persistently low interest rates,” the company said. The net
investment result fell 5 percent to $1.69 billion.  Losses from derivatives used for hedging resulted in net
capital losses of $70 million compared with gains of $18 million
a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Pierre Wauthier said on
a conference call.  Operating profit from its unit selling life and pension
products rose 6 percent to $308 million with the acquisition of
a Latin American insurance business from  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  in
2011.  Zurich Insurance is looking to bolster earnings by
expanding in emerging markets and also bought an operation in
 Malaysia  in 2011.  Zurich said its solvency ratio under Swiss rules introduced
in 2011 rose to 185 percent on Jan. 1, from 178 percent six
months earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
