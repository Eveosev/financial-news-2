Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the U.K. oil and gas
services provider, expects “modest” growth in profit this year
after the startup of the In Salah gas project in Algeria was
pushed back into the second half.  In Salah, which was shut down for security review by
operators  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and Sonatrach after a terrorist
attack at another Algerian facility in January, will restart in
the second half of the year, Petrofac said today. That’s later
than the company anticipated and will cause some earnings to be
delayed until next year, it said.  The project “was initially expected to recommence
quickly,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Weller said on a
conference call. “This later than expected remobilization will
result in significant deferral. As a result, we see modest
growth in profit this year.”  The shares fell 2.7 percent to 1,325 pence in  London .  Petrofac, which has fallen about 19 percent this year, says
it’s still set to meet a target of doubling earnings from 2010
to 2015. The company’s order backlog rose to a record $12.1
billion as of the end of April, it said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
