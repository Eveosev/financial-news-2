Sucres et Denrees SA took all of the
beans delivered against the expired May futures contract on the
NYSE Liffe exchange in  London , according to Derek Chambers, head
of cocoa at the Paris-based trading company.  The delivery was 34,530 metric tons, according to NYSE
Liffe data on its  website  today. That is lower than the 72,350
tons delivered when the March futures expired and compares with
44,010 tons in May last year, exchange data showed. Broker
Sucden Financial Ltd. in London received the beans on behalf of
Sucres et Denrees, its parent company.  Most of the cocoa, or 21,210 tons, was from leading
producer  Ivory Coast , according to the bourse. Beans from
 Nigeria  totaled 4,130 tons and from Cameroon 4,090 tons. The
remainder was from countries including  Sierra Leone  and Togo.  Brokers Jefferies Bache Ltd., Newedge U.K. Financial Ltd.
and ABN AMRO Clearing Bank NV delivered the beans on behalf of
clients, NYSE Liffe data showed. Sucres et Denrees re-entered
the cocoa market in July 2011 after having left just over 20
years earlier, according to the companyâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
