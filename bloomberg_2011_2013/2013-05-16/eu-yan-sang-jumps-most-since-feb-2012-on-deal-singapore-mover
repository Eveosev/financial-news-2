Eu Yan Sang International Ltd. (EYSAN) 
climbed by the most since February 2012 after the distributor of
traditional Chinese medicine signed a joint venture agreement to
process and export herbs from China.  The  stock  rose as much as 13.2 percent to S$0.77, the
biggest advance since Feb. 22, 2012 before trading at S$0.745 as
of 3:27 p.m. The benchmark Straits Times Index added 0.2
percent. The joint venture between Eu Yan Sang and Sichuan
Neautus Traditional Chinese Medicine Co. will be among the
largest exporters of TCM herbs from China, the Singapore-based
company said in a statement today.  “This is a positive move,” said Melissa Yeap, an analyst
at DMG & Partners Securities Pte. in  Singapore . “The Chinese
market is a very significant market.”  The equally-owned joint venture will operate a processing
plant in  Chengdu , China that could help Eu Yan Sang cut the cost
of raw materials for its products and improve the group’s profit
margins, according to the statement. The partners will invest 40
million  yuan  ($6.5 million) to set up the facility, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
