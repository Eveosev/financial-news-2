Corn capped the longest slump in more
than a month and wheat fell to a six-week low on signs that
warm, dry weather will allow U.S. farmers to accelerate planting
delayed by a cold, wet April. Soybeans rose.  More than 75 percent of the Midwest, the main growing
region, avoided light showers that fell in the past 24 hours,
 World Weather Inc.  said in a report today. While rain will be
more widespread May 18 to May 21, the region will be mostly dry
from May 24 to May 30, allowing active planting, the forecaster
said. Corn  sowing  was 28 percent complete on May 12, more than
double a week earlier, the government reported. The U.S. is the
world’s largest grain exporter.  “Most farmers have made very good progress planting corn
and spring wheat this week, and rain this weekend will aid early
development and yield potential,”  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis ,
said by telephone. “The grain markets are adjusting to the idea
that corn and wheat planting may jump to more than 60 percent to
65 percent completed by May 20.”  Corn futures for delivery in July fell 1.4 percent to close
at $6.415 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
capping for the first three-day drop since April 2.  Wheat futures for July delivery slipped 0.9 percent to
$6.8775 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $6.815, the lowest
for a most-active contract since April 3.  Spring-wheat planting was 43 percent completed as of May
12, up from 23 percent a week earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said on May 13.  Soybeans Rally  Soybeans advanced to a seven-week high on signs of
sustained demand for U.S. supplies from  China , the world’s
largest importer.  Rising demand for soy-based animal feed and cooking oil
will boost the China’s imports to 66 million metric tons from 59
million forecast in the year that ends Sept. 30, China National
Grain and Oils Information Center said in an e-mailed report
today.  Soybean futures for delivery in July rose 1 percent to
$14.275 a bushel in Chicago, after touching $14.31, the highest
for a most-active contract since March 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
