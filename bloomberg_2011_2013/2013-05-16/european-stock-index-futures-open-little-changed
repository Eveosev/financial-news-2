European stocks were little changed,
after the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index yesterday extended
its highest level since June 2008.  Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN)  lost 3.3 percent after reporting
earnings that missed estimates.  Suedzucker AG (SZU)  tumbled 6.7
percent after forecasting full-year operating profit will
decline. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA jumped 7.6 percent after
full-year earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx 600 slipped less than 0.1 percent to 307.97 at
the close of trading in London, after earlier rallying to its
highest level in almost five years. The gauge has still climbed
10 percent so far in 2013, its best start to a year since 1998,
bolstered by central-bank monetary stimulus.  “I think the obsession with all-time highs is a red
herring,” said David Hussey, who helps oversee $248 billion as
head of European equities at Manulife Asset Management in
 London . “The market has had a good run. A correction is
entirely possible, but there is a wall of money out there that
is going to buy on the dips. You have to be bullish on equities
in the short to medium term.”  National benchmark indexes retreated in 12 of the 18
western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.1
percent,  Germany ’s DAX Index added 0.1 percent, while  France ’s
CAC 40 lost 0.1 percent.  Zurich, Suedzucker  Zurich Insurance lost 3.3 percent to 261.30 Swiss francs
after Switzerland’s biggest insurer reported a 7 percent decline
in first-quarter net income to $1.06 billion. That missed the
$1.14 billion average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Martin Senn said in a statement
that the company is on track to meet its targets as all core
businesses delivered “high-quality” operating performance.  Suedzucker tumbled 6.7 percent to 27.34 euros after
Europe’s largest sugar producer forecast that full-year
operating profit will fall “significantly” to about 825
million euros.  Vivendi SA (VIV)  dropped 2.7 percent to 15.30 euros after
 Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)  was said to have shelved a plan to buy
back shares held by its French parent amid a disagreement on
price. The world’s largest video-game publisher planned to buy
at least part of Vivendi’s stake as recently as last month,
people with knowledge of the talks said.  Vivendi, which has a 61 percent Activision holding valued
at more than $10 billion, is still exploring how to extract cash
from its stake, including a possible dividend recapitalization,
one of the people said.  3i Group Plc lost 4.8 percent to 345.8 pence after the
U.K.’s largest publicly traded private-equity firm reported a
net value of its assets of 311 pence a share for the full year.
That missed the 315 pence to 325 pence estimate of Iain
Scouller, an analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd. in London who
rates the stock a sell. The shares have still surged 59 percent
so far this year.  Richemont (CFR)  jumped 7.6 percent to 88.80 francs after the
owner of the Cartier brand reported full-year net income of 2.01
billion euros ($2.58 billion), beating analyst estimates for
1.96 billion euros. The company also proposed a dividend of 1
franc, topping forecasts.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  rallied 7.2 percent to 346.5 pence, the biggest
gain since August 2012. The U.K.’s second-biggest insurer said
the value of new business in the first quarter rose 18 percent
to 191 million pounds ($290 million) as it raised prices and cut
costs in its home market.  TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc (TALK)  jumped 6.6 percent to 242 pence.
The company reported full-year sales in line with analyst
estimates and forecast revenue growth of at least 2 percent for
the year to end in March 2014. TalkTalk also proposed a full-year  dividend  of 10.4 pence a share.  Index Inclusion  Travis Perkins Plc increased 4.1 percent to 1,543 pence,
its highest price since June 2007, after the company said
“full-year earnings per share should be broadly in line with
market expectations.” The shares also advanced after the
company was included in the MSCI United Kingdom Index, prompting
funds that track the gauge to buy the stock.  Persimmon Plc was also added to the index, sending the
stock up 5.1 percent to 1,206 pence, its highest price since
August 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
