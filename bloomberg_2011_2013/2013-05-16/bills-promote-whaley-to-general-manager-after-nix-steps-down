Doug Whaley was promoted to general
manager of the  Buffalo Bills  after three seasons with the
National Football League team.  Whaley, 40, is the 12th general manager in franchise
history, the Bills said today in an e-mailed statement. For the
past three seasons, he oversaw the Bills’ personnel departments
as an assistant to Buddy Nix, who stepped down as GM this month
at the age of 73.  “Doug has been involved in every level of player personnel
throughout his career and he will lead our efforts in re-establishing a winning tradition for this organization,” Bills
Chief Executive Russ Brandon said in the statement.  The Bills were 6-10 last year, their eighth consecutive
losing season, and have not made the playoffs since 1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
