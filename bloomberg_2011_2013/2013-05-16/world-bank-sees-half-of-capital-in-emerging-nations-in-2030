Developing economies are bound to
play a larger role in financial markets as their share of global
capital is seen rising to 50 percent by 2030 from less than one-third today, the  World Bank ’s chief economist said.  In a report building scenarios for the global economy, the
World Bank also predicts that  developing countries  from China to
Colombia will account for about two-thirds of every dollar saved
and invested, from about half today.  “Currently, many countries with a dominant position in
trade and production play a relatively minor role in
international financial markets,”  Kaushik Basu , the World
Bank’s chief economist and senior vice president, wrote in a
foreword to the report, adding that the global financial crisis
of 2008-2009 had illustrated developing economies’ vulnerability
to what happens in financial centers of high-income countries.  “This is unlikely to persist in scenarios in which
developing countries’ share of global saving and investment
continues to rise,” he said.  The  International Monetary Fund  in April described emerging
economies as the motor of a three-speed recovery and forecast
they will grow 5.3 percent this year compared with 1.2 percent
for their developed counterparts.  -- Editors: Gail DeGeorge, Mark Rohner  To contact the reporter on this story:
