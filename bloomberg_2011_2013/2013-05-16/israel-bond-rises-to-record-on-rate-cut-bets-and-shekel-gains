Israel ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the yield down to a record, as inflation slowed and a
surprise interest reduction spurred bets the central bank could
follow with another rate cut.  The yield on the 4.25 percent notes due in March 2023 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.47 percent at
12:59 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The shekel rebounded from the biggest
five-day slump since September 2011, rising 0.4 percent to
3.6445 a dollar. Governor Stanley Fischer cut interest rates on
May 13, and announced a program to buy foreign currency to curb
the shekel’s appreciation. The currency has strengthened 8.8
percent in the past six months, making it the best performer
among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Fischer’s move shows that the central bank is determined
to fight shekel appreciation, increasing the likelihood for more
rate cuts in coming months,” Yshai Shilo, a fixed-income broker
at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd., said by phone
from Tel Aviv. “The low inflation data also supports a quarter-point rate-cut as early as the end of the month.”  Annual  inflation  slowed to 0.8 percent last month, falling
below the government’s 1 percent to 3 percent target for the
first time since July 2007, the statistics bureau said May 14.
That matched the  median estimate  of 14 analysts on Bloomberg.
The central bank will lower rates to 1.25 percent at its next
rate decision meeting on May 27, according to two of six
analysts in a Bloomberg  survey . The remainder expect no change.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, has dropped 21 basis
points this week. It rose two basis points to 1.34 percent
today.  Fischer, who will step down in June, has gradually cut
interest rates from 3.25 percent in 2011 to 1.5 percent, to
boost the economy amid the  European debt crisis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
