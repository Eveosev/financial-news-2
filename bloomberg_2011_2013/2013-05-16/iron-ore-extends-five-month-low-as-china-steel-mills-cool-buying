Iron ore extended losses for a fifth
day to a five-month low on speculation Chinese mills are drawing
on stockpiles as declining steel prices cut their profits,
according to  Macquarie Research .  Ore with 62 percent iron content at the Chinese port of
Tianjin fell 1.1 percent to $125 a dry metric ton, according to
The Steel Index Ltd. The benchmark price retreated 21 percent
from a 16-month high on Feb. 20, data show.  Stockpiles at Chinese ports are at a record low, and those
at small  steel mills  fell to 20 days of use, Macquarie said in
an e-mailed report today. Declining steel prices are squeezing
mills’ margins, and June maintenance will probably lead prices
lower before July, while supplies will also expand in the second
half of the year, according to the report.  “Steel prices in China are falling, hurting steel mill
margins,” Macquarie said in the report. “Adding this to the
expectation that mills will take maintenance downtime during
June means that the seeds are in place for a downturn in  iron
ore  in the near term.”  June swaps fell 0.8 percent to $120.50 a ton as of 12:25
p.m. in  London , according to GFI Group Inc., a broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
