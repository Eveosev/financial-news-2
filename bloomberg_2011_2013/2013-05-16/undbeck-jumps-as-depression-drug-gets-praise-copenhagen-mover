H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN)  rose the most in
seven weeks in Copenhagen trading after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
said the Nordic region’s second-largest drugmaker will revive
growth with its experimental depression treatment Brintellix.  Lundbeck rose as much as 4.2 percent, the most since March
26, which made the stock  today’s biggest winner  in the  OMX
Copenhagen 20 index. (KFX)  The shares of the Copenhagen-based company
gained 3.3 percent to 116.50 kroner at 11:24 a.m., with trading
volume at 87 percent of the three-month daily average.  Lundbeck, which is losing revenue as patents on its
bestselling anti-depressant Lexapro expire, said last month that
Brintellix met primary and secondary endpoints in a test. The
medicine will be as effective as existing antidepressants with
fewer side effects, JPMorgan said. It started coverage of
Lundbeck today with an overweight  recommendation .  “We expect upcoming U.S. Brintellix approval to secure a
return to strong growth from 2016 onwards,” James Gordon, an
analyst with JPMorgan, said in a note. “We forecast peak
Brintellix sales of $2.4 billion, driven by a cleaner
tolerability profile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
