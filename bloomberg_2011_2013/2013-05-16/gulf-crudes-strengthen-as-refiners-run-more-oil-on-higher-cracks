Crudes from the Gulf of Mexico
strengthened on the  spot market  as crack spreads reached the
highest level in more than three weeks, prompting refiners to
process more oil.  The  Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack , a rough measure of refining
margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil, rose 10 cents to
$23.07 a barrel at 2:10 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since April 23.  PADD 3 refineries increased their  crude runs  by 216,000
barrels to 8.14 million barrels a day the week ended May 10, the
highest level since Dec. 14, according to data from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil strengthened by 45 cents to
$10.75 a barrel more than WTI in Cushing,  Oklahoma , at 2:01
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet’s premium increased by $1 to $10.20 a barrel.  Mars Blend strengthened 15 cents to $5.30 a barrel more
than WTI. Poseidon gained 45 cents on WTI to a premium of $5.10.
The premium for crude from the Southern Green Canyon increased
by 40 cents to $3.15.  Thunder Horse ’s premium strengthened by 35
cents to $7.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
