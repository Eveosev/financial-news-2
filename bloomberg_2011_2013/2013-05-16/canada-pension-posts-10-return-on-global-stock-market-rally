Canada  Pension Plan Investment Board,
the country’s second-largest public pension manager, posted a
return of 10 percent in the fiscal year after it boosted
exposure to international markets.  Investment income was C$16.7 billion ($16.4 billion) for
the year ended March 31, the Toronto-based  fund manager  said
today in a statement. Assets rose 13.4 percent to C$183.3
billion from last year.  “The world’s proportion of GDP is evolving from the
developed world to the developing world and as a long-term
investor we are trying to be ahead of that trend,” Chief
Executive Officer  Mark Wiseman , who assumed the role from David
Denison in July, said in a phone interview from Toronto. “The
reality is, Canada as a developed economy is not going to
exhibit the same type of growth that those other economies are
going to exhibit.”  Canada Pension’s 10 percent return beat the 9.4 percent
median of Canadian pension funds in the 12 months to March 31,
according to RBC Investor Services.  The fund, which manages retirement savings for 18 million
people in every province except  Quebec , continues to look
outside the country for growth, it said in a statement. In 2013,
Canada Pension acquired a 39 percent stake in Dorna Sports S.L.,
the organizer of the FIM Road Racing World Championship Grand
Prix, and an almost 50 percent stake in Grupo Costanera, the
largest urban toll road operator in  Chile .  Canada Pension’s equity stake in foreign developed markets
grew 13 percent to C$64 billion from last year, and made up 35
percent of its equity portfolio at the end of March. Canadian
equities made up 8.4 percent and  emerging markets  6.7 percent.  Canadian assets represented 36.7 percent of the portfolio
at C$67.4 billion, while foreign assets represented 63.3
percent. Equities made up 50 percent of the portfolio, or C$91.7
billion, while fixed income made up 33 percent and real assets
17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
