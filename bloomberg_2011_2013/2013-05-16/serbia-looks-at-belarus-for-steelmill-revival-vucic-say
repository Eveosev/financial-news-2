Serbia hopes  Belarus  will save its
unprofitable steel plant in Smederevo and “a solution” may be
negotiated soon, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said.  The government “has discussed Zelezara Smederevo” with
Belarus Deputy Premier Pyotr Prokopovich and “we are hoping
that we will be able to resolve that problem in the very near
future,” Vucic told reporters in Belgrade today after meeting
his Belarus counterpart. He did not disclose any other detail.  Serbia has tried to find a buyer for Zelezara since January
2012 when  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  sold it back to the state for $1.  Zelezara restarted one of its two furnaces on April 22,
after nine months and even at a projected loss of 20 million
euros ($25.7 million) in 2013. The plant costs 145 million euros
per month when idle, Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said in
March 1 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
