William Lyon Homes (LWHS) , a builder that
emerged from bankruptcy last year, raised $217.5 million in a
public stock offering that priced above the marketed range.  The Newport Beach, California-based builder, which has
traded over the counter, and an existing stockholder sold 8.7
million shares for $25 apiece, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, after offering them for $22 to $24 each.  William Lyon joins at least two U.S. homebuilders that
conducted public offerings this year as investors seek to
capitalize on the housing-market recovery. New-home demand has
been rising as buyers seeking to take advantage of low  mortgage 
rates find a tight  supply  of existing properties for sale.  “William Lyon is located in several markets that are
growing swiftly,” Megan McGrath, an analyst with MKM Partners
LLC in  Stamford , Connecticut, wrote in a note yesterday before
the pricing. “However, its locations combined with its long
land supply in those areas -- we estimate 16 years of supply in
Arizona -- creates longer-term risk, in our view, if sales pace
in its chosen markets begins to ease.”  McGrath, who hasn’t rated William Lyon, estimates it will
have earnings per share of 44 cents for fiscal 2013 as the
number of homes sold increases 45 percent and orders grow 21
percent from the previous year. The company had a net loss of
$3.5 million, or 3 cents a share, for the quarter ended March
31, according to a May 3 filing.  Paulson, Colony  The company’s backers include Paulson & Co., the firm run
by  John Paulson , who earned $15 billion in 2007 betting against
subprime mortgages; Luxor Capital Group LP, a New York-based
investment manager; and Thomas Barrack Jr.’s  Colony Capital LLC ,
which lent $206 million to William Lyon before its bankruptcy.
Luxor is offering about 2.2 million shares in the sale and will
trim its stake to 30 percent from 47 percent. Paulson’s stake
will decrease to 11 percent from 14 percent, and Colony’s stake
will drop to 3.9 percent from 5 percent.  William Lyon had a net loss of $11.6 million on revenue of
$372.8 million from Feb. 25, 2012, when it emerged from
bankruptcy, to Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing. The
company sold 883 homes for an average price of $277,000 at
communities in California, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado.  The stock sale was led by Credit Suisse Group AG and
Citigroup Inc. The shares will be listed on the  New York  Stock
Exchange under the symbol WLH.  Tri Pointe Homes Inc., an  Irvine , California-based builder
