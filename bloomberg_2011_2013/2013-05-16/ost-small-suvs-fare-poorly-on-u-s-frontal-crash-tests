Almost all the small sport-utility
vehicles tested by an insurance industry group fared poorly in a
simulation of a deadly type of front-end crash.  Subaru’s Forester was the only vehicle out of 13 tested to
score “good,” while  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7267) ’s Outlander Sport
placed second with an “acceptable” rating in a test the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety began using last year.  The rest scored “poor” or “marginal.” Vehicles rated
“poor” were the  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  Tucson,  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) 
Sportage,  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Buick Encore, Chrysler LLC’s Jeep
Patriot and  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Escape.  Small SUVs have become an increasingly popular choice for
families, with sales of all SUVs and sport wagons rising 13.6
percent this year through April, according to auto researcher
Autodata Corp., based in  Woodcliff Lake ,  New Jersey . Total
vehicle sales were up 11.3 percent for that period.  “With the redesigned Forester, Subaru’s engineers set out
to do well in our new test, and they succeeded,” Joe Nolan, the
institute’s vice president for vehicle research, said in an e-mailed statement. “This is exactly how we hoped manufacturers
would respond to improve protection for people in these kinds of
serious frontal crashes.”  The scores for the Subaru, a unit of  Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd. (7270)  and the Mitsubishi gave them the “top safety pick plus”
designation, the group’s highest.  Tougher Test  The insurance institute’s test simulates a vehicle’s front
corner colliding with a car, tree or pole. It’s tougher than
U.S. auto-safety regulators’ crash tests that are used to rate
vehicles on a five-star system.  The six vehicles scored “marginal” included Nissan Motor
Co.’s Rogue. The door frame of that model was pushed “far
inside” the passenger compartment in the crash and almost
touched the driver, the institute said.  The other SUVs scoring “marginal” were Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG’s X1,  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ’s CX-5, Honda Motor Co.’s CR-V,
the Jeep Wrangler and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Tiguan.  The institute, based in Arlington,  Virginia , and funded by
the  insurance industry , has said it introduced the test last
year because that type of accident accounts for almost one-fourth of frontal crashes that seriously injure or kill people
in front seats.  It previously tested luxury and mid-size sedans. Twenty
models have attained “top safety pick plus” so far.  Last year was the first year since 2005 when deaths on U.S.
roads increased, rising 5.3 percent to 34,080, according to
preliminary estimates from the U.S. National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
