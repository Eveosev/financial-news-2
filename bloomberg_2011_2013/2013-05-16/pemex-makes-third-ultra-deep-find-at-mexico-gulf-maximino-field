Petroleos Mexicanos , the world’s
fourth-largest oil producer, made its third ultra-deepwater
discovery on the Mexican side of the Perdido basin in the Gulf
of Mexico.  Tests at the Maximino field where the crude was found are
still being made and volumes are being assessed, Luis Ramos, a
strategic planning manager at the Mexican state-owned oil
producer’s exploration unit, told reporters in  Rio de Janeiro 
today, declining to give any estimate.  “We got crude,” Ramos said of the field. “It’s going
very well and shows a tendency for the system.”  Maximino, which Pemex officials have called “the jewel in
the crown” of the company’s deepwater portfolio, is at a depth
of 2,900 meters (9,515 feet), the most ever for the Mexican oil
producer. Last year Pemex made its first two commercially viable
deepwater discoveries in the Perdido area about 200 miles (320
kilometers) east of the Texas-Mexico border in the  Gulf of
Mexico , after 23 attempts.  Officials at Pemex’s press department didn’t immediately
respond to e-mailed questions about estimated volumes at
Maximino.  To contact the reporter on this story:
