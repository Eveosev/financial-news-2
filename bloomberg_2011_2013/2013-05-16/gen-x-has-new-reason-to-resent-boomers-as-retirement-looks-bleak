Generation X, the unlucky cohort of
Americans who became young adults during the boom years of the
1990s only to suffer a midlife bust, is facing bleak retirement
prospects, according to  a study .  The Pew Charitable Trusts said the typical Gen X couple,
born between 1966 and 1975, only has enough savings to replace
half of its pre-retirement earnings. Married Americans born
during the first part of the baby boom, from 1946 to 1955, can
expect to retire with about 82 percent of their income. The
younger boomers, born between 1956 and 1964, can expect to quit
work and make about 59 percent of pre-retirement earnings.  The report, released yesterday, comes as the 76 million-member baby boom generation is beginning to retire, while
working-age adults are confronting potential shortfalls in
government-sponsored retirement and health-care programs.  Younger boomers and Gen X’ers “face a real possibility of
downward mobility in their golden years,” said Diana Elliott, a
manager for the Washington-based research organization.  Financial planners recommend that retiring Americans be
able to replace 70 to 100 percent of pre-retirement income
through wealth and savings. The recession from December 2007 to
June 2009, which erased $16.4 trillion in wealth, made that goal
more difficult for tens of millions of Americans.  Biggest Losers  The typical Gen X’ers lost the most, with 45 percent of
pre-recession net worth of $75,077 vanishing from 2007 to 2010,
the Pew study said. Depression-era babies born from 1926 to 1935
saw their median $207,965 nest egg virtually unchanged. War
babies, born from 1936 to 1945, suffered a typical cut of 20
percent to a pre-recession net worth of $265,797.  The Pew study, based on the  Federal Reserve System ’s annual
Survey of Consumer Finances, found early boomers lost 28 percent
of their median stash of $241,333, and their younger siblings
dropped 25 percent of a typical $147,671 net worth.  Almost all generations gained more from the decade-long
housing bubble than they lost in its immediate collapse, Pew
found. Even so, the meltdown in the real estate market was the
largest drain on net worth during the recession.  Gen X’ers again suffered the most, losing a median 27
percent, or $18,052, of their typical $67,052 in home equity.
Depression-era babies lost about 3 percent, or $4,104, of their
median $145,104 in home equity.  Early boomers, whose home equity amounts soared 96 percent
during the housing bubble, lost about 22 percent of $143,532 in
wealth during the recession. Late boomers lost approximately 14
percent of their $104,768 in pre-recession home equity, Pew
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
