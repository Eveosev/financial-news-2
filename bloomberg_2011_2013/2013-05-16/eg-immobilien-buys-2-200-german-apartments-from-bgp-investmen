LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) ,  Germany ’s largest
residential landlord by market value, bought about 2,200
apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia from a group of investors
led by BGP Investment.  The transaction will increase LEG’s homes to more than
93,000, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a statement today.
No price was disclosed.  LEG in February was taken public by former owner Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in the German property industry’s biggest
initial public offering. The company, benefiting from rising
rents in Germany, said it has more property-portfolio
acquisitions in the pipeline.  The homes in the purchase announced today are in cities
including Dortmund and Essen and generate annual net rent of
more than 6.1 million euros ($7.8 million), LEG said. The deal
is expected to be completed on Aug. 1.  LEG gained as much as  3.4 percent  to 46.38 euros in
Frankfurt trading, the highest since the IPO. LEG has a market
value of 2.44 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
