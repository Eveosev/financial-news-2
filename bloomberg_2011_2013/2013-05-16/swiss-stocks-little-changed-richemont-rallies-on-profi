Swiss stocks  declined from their
highest level since January 2008 as  Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) 
reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Zurich Insurance slid the most in more than a month after
first-quarter net income dropped 7 percent.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  slipped
1.2 percent after a report that the drugmaker may bid for
Actavis Inc. Cie. Financiere  Richemont (CFR)  SA climbed the most in
three weeks after increasing its dividend and posting full-year
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  fell 0.7 percent to 8,256.15 at the
close in Zurich, erasing an advance of as much as 0.4 percent.
The equity benchmark climbed yesterday as Bank of England
Governor Mervyn King raised his forecasts for economic growth in
the U.K. The gauge is trading at 15.5 times estimated earnings,
close to its highest valuation since 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The broader Swiss Performance Index
slipped 0.6 percent today.  “Today’s drop is probably a reaction to yesterday’s
rise,” said Christoph Riniker, head of strategy research at
Bank Julius Baer & Co. in Zurich. “We always have to keep in
mind that the market could become pricey, which could lead to a
slowing in the coming weeks or months. Earnings have been
mediocre. But there is a constructive environment for equities,
so we believe that markets should go higher.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday climbed to its
ninth record in 10 days, as weak  manufacturing data  fueled
speculation the Federal Reserve will not scale back stimulus.  U.S. Economy  A Commerce Department report today showed U.S.  housing
starts  declined to an 853,000 annual rate in April from a
revised 1.02 million pace in March. The median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a 970,000 reading.  Zurich Insurance dropped 3.3 percent to 261.30 Swiss
francs, the most since April 8, after Switzerland’s biggest
insurer said first-quarter  net income  fell to $1.06 billion from
$1.14 billion a year earlier. That missed the $1.14 billion
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Novartis lost 1.2 percent to 72.20 francs as the Wall
Street Journal reported that Europe’s biggest drugmaker is
considering an offer for Actavis. The newspaper cited a person
familiar with the matter. The U.S. generic-drug maker has
already rejected approaches by Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. and Mylan Inc. Novartis spokesman  Eric Althoff  said that the Basel-based company has no intention of
bidding for Actavis.  Nestle SA (NESN) , which has a weighting of 21 percent on the SMI,
declined 1.8 percent to 66.70 francs.  Richemont Rises  Richemont rallied 7.6 percent to 88.80 francs after
increasing its dividend by 82 percent to 1 franc a share. The
owner of the Cartier brand said full-year net income climbed 30
percent to 2.01 billion euros ($2.6 billion), surpassing the
 average analyst estimate  of 1.96 billion euros.  The company, which also owns Alfred Dunhill, said in a
statement that Chairman Johann Rupert will take a one-year
sabbatical after the annual shareholder meeting in September.  Swatch Group AG, the biggest maker of Swiss watches, added
2.4 percent to 594 francs, rising for a fourth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
