China  ordered local authorities to
tighten scrutiny of the production and sale of fake meat
products, the official Xinhua News Agency  reported  today, citing
the State Council’s Food Safety Commission Office.  Local government agencies for agriculture, quality
supervision, and food and drugs should establish investigative
and feedback systems on food safety, Xinhua said, citing a
report from the Food Safety office. They should also increase
undercover and official checks on suspected fake meat
syndicates, the report said.  China has cracked down on food-safety violations after
incidents including tainted baby formula, excessive levels of
antibiotics in chicken and chemicals in liquor sparked public
outrage. The nation created a new administration in March
charged with overseeing food and drug safety in the country.  The Ministry of Public Security said in a May 2 statement
that authorities had busted a criminal operation found to have
sold rat, fox and mink meat as mutton in  Shanghai  and
neighboring Jiangsu province, generating more than 10 million
 yuan  ($1.62 million).  Authorities should increase incentives and safety
protection for whistle-blowers in order to encourage citizens to
get involved, and make sure that dead animal carcasses are
handled properly, today’s report said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
