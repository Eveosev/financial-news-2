National Bank of Kenya Ltd.  will
raise as much as 10 billion shillings ($119 million) in a rights
offer to fund an expansion plan as it seeks to quadruple revenue
by 2017, Managing Director Munir Sheikh Ahmed said.  The sale of shares to existing shareholders is expected to
take place by the first quarter of 2014, Ahmed said in an
interview at his office today in Nairobi, the capital. The funds
will be used to open 10 new branches in Kenya and start
operations in  South Sudan ,  Uganda  and Somalia, he said.  “The strategic plan is to ensure the bank’s potential,
described as a sleeping giant, is realized in the next five
years,” Ahmed said. The bank is targeting revenue of 31 billion
shillings by 2017, compared with 8 billion shillings last year,
he said.  National Bank was the only publicly traded lender in  Kenya 
to report a drop in profit in 2012. Net income dropped 53
percent to 729.8 million shillings as earnings from interest on
loans dipped 6 percent to 4.77 billion shillings. Results in the
first quarter of 2013, which have to be published, suggest the
company will achieve an improved performance this year, Ahmed
said.  “We expect better growth on a year-to-year basis,” he
said.  Ahmed took over as managing director on Aug. 1 from Reuben Marambii, who held the post for 14 years after being seconded by
the Central Bank of Kenya in 1999 to save the loss-making lender
from collapse and return it to profit.  National Bank was founded in 1968 and began trading its
shares on the Nairobi Securities Exchange in 1994, when the
government sold 32 percent of its stake. In 1996, the state
reduced its stake to 22.5 percent. The state-owned  National
Social Security Fund  holds 48.06 percent of the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
