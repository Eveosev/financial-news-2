JAT Tehnika,  Serbia ’s aircraft
maintenance company, will start servicing  Airbus SAS (EAD)  A319s,
A320s and A321s, and new models of ATR turboprops after
receiving a license from aviation authorities.  The Belgrade-based company, which so far worked only on
Boeing Co. planes and earlier versions of ATR-72s, was issued
the new permit by Serbia’s  Civil Aviation Directorate  in
cooperation with European Aviation Safety Agency, or EASA, the
national regulator said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Our first client for Airbus maintenance will probably be
JAT Airways,” Serbia’s flag carrier that’s adding such jets to
its  fleet , said Miroslav Musulin, JAT Tehnika’s executive
director, in a phone interview. “Wizz Air Ltd. and Air Arabia
may follow, or any airline that uses the Belgrade airport.”  State-controlled and profitable JAT Tehnika was spun off
from the flag carrier, which the government is trying to sell.  To contact the reporter on this story: Misha Savic in Belgrade
