Sally Bercow, the wife of the U.K.
House of Commons speaker, pointed the “finger of blame” at a
former U.K. politician with a Twitter post linking him to a
British Broadcasting Corp. story on a pedophile.  Lawyers for Alistair McAlpine, 71, told a London court that
Bercow wrongly accused him of being a pedophile during the media
frenzy that followed the incorrect  BBC  report.  “One would have to have been an anchorite in a sealed cave
not to have known about the background” of Bercow’s comment on
the social media site, McApline’s lawyer, Edward Garnier, said
in written submissions for the start of the trial today.  The BBC apologized and agreed to pay McAlpine, a former
Conservative Party treasurer, 185,000 pounds ($280,000) over the
story last year. Before the broadcaster retracted the story,
McAlpine was the subject of thousands of tweets linking him to
the story.  Bercow, who is married to House of Commons speaker John Bercow, wrote a post in November asking why McAlpine, a member
of the British House of Lords, was trending on Twitter.  “There was a prominent and salacious story in the media,
and what was missing was the name of the abuser at its center,”
Garnier said in court filings.  The post made “no express statement of fact,” Bercow’s
lawyers said in documents filed at the  High Court  for today’s
trial, denying the comment was defamatory. It was “an entirely
neutral statement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
