3i Group Plc (III) , Britain’s largest
publicly traded private-equity firm, increased its target for
cost savings in 2014 to 60 million pounds ($91.3 million) after
investments returned to profit.  The company reduced costs by 51 million pounds in the 12
months ended March 31, exceeding its 40 million-pound goal for
that year, London-based 3i said in a statement today. It had
sought to eliminate 45 million pounds of costs by March 2014.  3i replaced its chief executive officer last year and began
cutting costs after shareholders urged the company to stop
making deals and return money to investors. Activist investor
 Edward Bramson  started building a stake in 3i five months ago.
He became chairman of London-based  F&C Asset Management Plc (FCAM) 
after criticizing the company’s business strategy and ousting
his predecessor.  “We have made significant and rapid progress in the
turnaround of 3i,” CEO Simon Borrows said in the statement.
“This represents a major step toward our objective of aligning
3i’s cost base with its annual cash income.”  Net asset value increased 11.5 percent from the year-earlier period to 311 pence a share at the end of March. 3i
reaped 606 million pounds by selling assets, down from 771
million pounds in the year-earlier period. The  company  spent 172
million pounds on investments, compared with 464 million pounds
in the preceding 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
