Brazil ’s swap rates dropped from a
four-week high as an index of wholesale, construction and
consumer prices fell more than forecast, spurring speculation
the central bank will limit increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates due in January 2015 declined five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.38 percent at 9:14 a.m. in Sao
Paulo. They rose two basis points yesterday to 8.43 percent, the
highest level on a closing basis since April 17. The real fell
for a third day, declining 0.2 percent to 2.0269 per U.S.
dollar, the weakest level since Jan. 25.  The Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today that its May
IGP-10 index of wholesale, construction and consumer  prices  fell
0.09 percent. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a decrease of 0.06 percent. The IGP-10
monitors prices from the 11th day of the previous month to the
10th day of the current month.  “The inflation data today show that there is some relief
that is helping to bring down the swap rates,” Ures Folchini,
the head of fixed income at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA in Sao
Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
