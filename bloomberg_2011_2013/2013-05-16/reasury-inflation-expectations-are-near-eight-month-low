Treasuries rose, with 10-year note
yields headed for their biggest two-day decline since mid-April,
as government and Federal Reserve reports pointed to a weakening
economy and slower inflation.  The difference between the yields on the benchmark
securities and 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed debt narrowed to
an eight-month low. Separate reports showed jobless claims
reached the highest level in six weeks and the cost of living
fell in April for a second month.  U.S. debt  rallied as the
economic data, including an unexpected decline in the Fed Bank
of Philadelphia’s general economic index this month, cooled
speculation the central bank may slow its bond-buying program to
bolster the economy.  “Treasuries response makes a lot of sense with the numbers
we’ve seen,” said  Joseph LaVorgna , chief U.S. economist in New
York for Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “The Fed doesn’t change
anything; nothing changes on this data.”  The U.S. 10-year  yield  dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.88 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2023 added 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000 face amount, to
98 26/32. The yield climbed to 1.98 percent yesterday, the
highest level since March 15.  Thirty-year bonds rose more than one point, pushing the
yield down six basis points to 3.1 percent.  Debt Returns  Trading volume dropped to $377.7 billion after reaching
$451 billion on May 10, the highest level since Feb. 1,
according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S.
government debt . The average daily volume for 2013 is $284.4
billion.  Treasuries have dropped 1.1 percent this month as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
The debt has lost 0.3 percent this year after gaining 2.2
percent in 2012.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities narrowed to
2.24 percentage points, the least since September.  The Treasury announced it will sell $13 billion in 10-year
TIPS on May 23. It sold an equal amount of the securities on
March 21 at a yield of negative 0.602 percent.  TIPS handed investors a loss of 2.3 percent in May through
yesterday, already making this month the worst since the
securities tumbled 8.5 percent in October 2008, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Treasuries overall have
declined 1.1 percent.  Fed View  Fed Bank of Boston President  Eric Rosengren  said inflation
that has “persistently” stayed below the Fed’s goal is a
concern and may suggest policy hasn’t done enough to support
growth.  “The longer we in the U.S. remain so far below our 2
percent target, the greater the risk that inflation expectations
could fall and real  interest rates  rise,” Rosengren said in the
text of prepared remarks delivered in Milan today. Low inflation
and high unemployment “could lead one to argue that policy has
not been sufficiently accommodative.”  Three other Fed regional bank presidents called for phasing
out the Fed’s monthly purchases of $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities as the housing recovery shows signs of gaining
momentum.  Dallas Fed Bank President  Richard Fisher  said today buying
mortgage bonds risks disrupting the market, while Philadelphia
Fed President  Charles Plosser  said, “it’s not good for the bank
to be holding lots of mortgage paper.”  Jeffrey Lacker  of
Richmond said to reporters yesterday the Fed should “get out of
the credit allocation business.”  Debt Buys  The U.S. central bank is purchasing $85 billion of
government and mortgage debt each month to cap borrowing costs.
The central bank purchased $1.45 billion of Treasuries maturing
between February 2036 and May 2043 today, according to the New
York Fed’s  website .  Yields dropped as the Labor Department reported that
initial jobless claims increased to 360,000 in the week ended
May 11. The median forecast of 50 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a rise to 330,000 from 323,000 the previous week.  “The higher claims is probably the most disturbing news,”
said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in  New York  at
primary dealer Credit Suisse Group AG. “The Fed is justified in
continuing its asset-purchase program and easy monetary
policy.”  The  consumer price index  decreased 0.4 percent, the biggest
decrease since December 2008, after falling 0.2 percent in
March, according to Labor Department figures released today in
 Washington . Economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected a 0.3
percent drop, according to the median estimate. The so-called
core price measure, which excludes more volatile food and energy
costs, increased 0.1 percent, less than projected.  Inflation View  “There’s no inflation,” said Thomas di Galoma, senior
vice president of fixed-income rates trading at ED&F Man Capital
Markets in New York. “The data is fairly anemic. There’s a good
case to be made for the rally in the  bond market . The only thing
that was promising was permits on the housing front.”  The Fed Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index fell
to minus 5.2 in May from 1.3 the prior month. The median
forecast of 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
gain to 2. Estimates ranged from minus 5 to 5.  Housing starts slumped 16.5 percent, the most since
February 2011, to an 853,000 annualized rate after a revised
1.02 million pace in March, the Commerce Department reported
today in Washington. The median estimate of 81 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 970,000 rate.  Building permits increased 14.3 percent to a 1.02 million
annualized rate in April, the highest level since June 2008,
exceeding the median forecast of 941,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
