Itau BBA, the wholesale arm of Latin
America’s biggest bank by market value, said it expects
investment-banking fees from Brazil to shrink to about 40
percent of the region’s total from 60 percent now.  Investment-banking transactions in Colombia,  Mexico ,  Chile 
and  Peru  will account for a greater share of the total, Jean-Marc Etlin, chief executive officer of Sao Paulo-based Itau
BBA’s investment-banking division, said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television with  Erik Schatzker  and Sara Eisen.  “They are small countries, but very active, with good
demographics, good government policies and as such, the markets
are thriving,” he said, adding that central bank policies in
Europe and the U.S. to boost economic growth have generated a
“tremendous” amount of money that may be invested in Latin
America.  Brazilian investment banks are branching out
internationally as the nation’s economic growth slows. Brazil’s
economy expanded 0.9 percent in 2012, compared with 4 percent
for Colombia and 3.9 percent for Mexico. Itau has said it may
open a corporate and investment bank in Mexico this year.  “We’re basically closing the map of Latin America so the
footprint becomes complete,” Etlin said.  Banco Bradesco SA, the second-biggest bank in  Brazil , is
also looking at expansion plans for markets in Colombia, Peru,
Chile and Mexico, Sergio Clemente, an executive director at the
Osasco-based lender, said in an interview last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
