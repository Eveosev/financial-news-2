Chinese stocks fell for the first
time in three days in New York, led by  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ)  and
 NetEase Inc. (NTES) , on concern slowing foreign investment will delay a
rebound in the world’s second-largest economy.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. slipped 1 percent to 94.39 yesterday.

and investment data trailed projections. The China-US gauge has

in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)   “The data so far points to a very sluggish growth
recovery,” Michael Wang, an emerging-markets strategist at
Amiya Capital LLP in  London , said by e-mail. “It means the
equity market will continue to struggle. It’s hard to see where
the catalysts are for a big rally unless the market gets
technically very oversold.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., dropped 0.6 percent in New

a year earlier to $2.9 million, below the $4.2 million average
estimate of four analysts compiled by Bloomberg, and compared

raised its sales  forecast  for 2013 to as much as $184 million
from the previous $183 million.  “Even though the company beat a little and raised guidance
slightly higher, people expected a little more,” Jun Zhang, an
analyst at Wedge Partners Corp., said by e-mail yesterday.  NetEase, the operator of  China ’s second-largest online
games website, fell 3.9 percent to $58.07 after rising to $60.42
