Grain exports from the French port of
Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest wheat-shipping hub, fell 65 percent to
the lowest weekly level since December after deliveries to
 Algeria  dropped and a barley cargo to  Israel  wasn’t repeated.  Deliveries slumped to 72,340 metric tons in the seven days
through May 15 from 207,522 tons in the prior period, the  Seine
River port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. Wheat cargoes fell
to 55,245 tons from 156,050 tons.  Algeria was the biggest destination, taking 50,845 tons of
soft wheat, down from 105,820 tons in the prior week.  Spain 
ranked second with 7,892 tons of barley, against 4,022 tons
previously.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, exceeding the 17 percent share for La Pallice on
the Bay of Biscay and Dunkirk on the  North Sea  with 11 percent
of the total, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
