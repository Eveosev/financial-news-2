GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the
largest polysilicon maker, cut production 29 percent in the
first quarter of the main raw material used in solar cells.  Output fell to 8,653 metric tons from 12,235 metric tons a
year earlier, the Hong Kong-based manufacturer said in a
statement today.  GCL-Poly sold 3,702 tons in the quarter, a 22 percent
increase from a year ago, at an average price of $16.62 per
kilogram, the company said. Wafer production in the first
quarter rose 5.8 percent to 1,231 megawatts, as sales, at an
average price of 21 cents per watt, gained 20 percent to 1,482
megawatts.  The company said it “expects both the demand and selling
prices of polysilicon and wafer to remain stable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
