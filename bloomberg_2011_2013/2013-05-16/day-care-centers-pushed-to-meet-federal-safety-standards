Child-care centers that get U.S.
government subsidies will for the first time have to meet a
uniform set of federal standards for employee background checks,
first-aid training and other protective measures.  The proposal by the  Department of Health  and Human Services
would force state governments to require child-care providers to
comply with fire, health and building codes, set up safety
training, fingerprint employees and agree to surprise
inspections. More than 500,000 facilities that accept federal
funding will be affected, the agency said today in a  statement .  This rule updates regulations last published in 1998 that
left oversight of child-care businesses largely up to states.
The decision to expand federal oversight is being proposed
because “too many children remain in settings that do not meet
minimum standards of health and safety,” the agency said.  “What’s troubling is that child-care safety standards vary
state-by-state, even city-by-city,”  Kathleen Sebelius , the U.S.
health and human services secretary, said today on a conference
call. “The rule would require child-care information to be
available in user-friendly websites.”  The rule would apply to providers who accept federal Child
Care and Development funds, which serve about 1.6 million low-income children, according to the statement. The proposal is
subject to a 75-day comment period before taking effect and
wouldn’t impose on a state’s ability to license child-care
providers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
