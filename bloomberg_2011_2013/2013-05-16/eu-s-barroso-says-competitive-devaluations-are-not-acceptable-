 European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said euro-area policymakers would oppose any efforts by
trade partners to gain an economic advantage by weakening their
currencies.  “Competitive devaluations are simply not acceptable,”
Barroso told a business conference today in Brussels. “We don’t
think that the currency rate should be used as a way of gaining
competitiveness.”  Barroso said he had discussed the question of exchange
rates with Roberto Azevedo, the new designated director-general
of the  World Trade Organization , and expressed hope that the WTO
would be “attentive” to the issue of currency manipulation.  The commission is the executive arm of the 27-nation
European Union, 17 of whose members share the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
