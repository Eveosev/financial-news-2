Philippine  government bonds  due 2035
advanced a second day on the prospect of improved returns from
fixed-income securities after inflation slowed.  Consumer prices increased 2.6 percent in April from a year
earlier, the least since March 2012, official data show.
Inflation continues to be within target, central bank Assistant
Governor Cyd Amador told reporters in Manila on May 10 after the
authority lowered its 2013 forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.3
percent last month.  Local bonds “continue to be well-supported,” said Jill Singian, a fixed-income portfolio manager at  Bank of the
Philippine Islands (BPI)  in Manila. “We still expect inflation to be
well-anchored.”  The yield on the 8.125 percent bonds due December 2035
dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.98
percent as of 4:13 p.m. in Manila, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services.  The peso was at 41.220 per dollar, compared with 41.205
yesterday, according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, dropped one basis point to
4.30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
