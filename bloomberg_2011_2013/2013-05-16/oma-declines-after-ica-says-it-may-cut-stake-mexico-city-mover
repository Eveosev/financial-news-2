Mexican airport operator  Grupo
Aeroportuario del Centro Norte SAB  fell the most in almost a
month after its parent company announced a plan to sell part of
its stake.  Shares  declined  7.3 percent to 45.45 pesos at 9:56 a.m. in
Mexico City, after falling 7.4 percent, the largest intraday
drop since April 17. Empresas ICA SAB, Mexico’s largest
construction company, filed a shelf registration with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday to sell as many as
100 million shares in the airport company, known as OMA.  The potential sale would boost the number of OMA shares on
the market and pressure the stock price, according to Luis Willard, an analyst at Corporativo GBM SAB. OMA climbed 40
percent this year through yesterday’s close, compared with a 1.3
percent decline for airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del
Sureste SAB and an 8.3 percent drop for Grupo Aeroportuario del
Pacifico SAB.  “The sale could give you an excess of supply in OMA
shares,” Willard, who rates OMA market underperform, said in an
interview from  Mexico  City. “And that’s coming when anything
positive about OMA was already priced in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
