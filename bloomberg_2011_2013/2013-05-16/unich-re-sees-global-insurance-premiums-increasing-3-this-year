Munich Re (MUV2) , the world’s biggest
reinsurer, said it expects global primary insurance premiums to
rise 3 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2014, driven by
higher life sales.  As “key industrialized countries improve” in the second
half of this year and next year, there will be more demand for
insurance, spurring an increase in premium growth from the 1
percent recorded last year, the Munich-based reinsurer said in a
statement.  While global premiums fell in 2011 on lower life sales,
according to a study by  Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , Munich Re predicts that
part of the business will rebound.  “The global economic recovery is also benefiting the
insurance industry,” Michael Menhart, Munich Re’s chief
economist, said in the statement. “We expect the economies of
key industrialized countries to improve in the second half of
2013 and in 2014,” which will drive insurance demand, he said.  The reinsurer, which helps primary insurers shoulder risks,
expects reinsurance premium growth to decline to 1 percent this
year from 3.3 percent in 2012 after natural catastrophes in the
previous years pushed up prices.  The property- and casualty-insurance market as a whole will
grow by approximately 50 percent this year compared with 2012 to
1.85 trillion euros ($2.38 trillion), and the life-insurance
market by almost two-thirds to 3.1 trillion euros, Munich Re
said.  “Growth in insurance and reinsurance in emerging countries
will be significantly stronger than in industrialized
countries,” according to Munich Re. Meanwhile, Europe and the
industrialized countries of the Asia-Pacific region will
continue to spur growth, it said.  The share of total primary insurance premiums in
industrialized countries will fall to about 73 percent by 2020
–- about 10 percentage points lower than in 2012, Munich Re
said. The amount generated by the emerging countries in Asia
will move up from 8 percent to 16 percent, according to the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
