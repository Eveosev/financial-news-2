President  Barack Obama  urged Congress
to fully fund his budget requests for security at U.S.
diplomatic missions as a way to “truly honor” the memories of
the four Americans killed last year in Benghazi, Libya.  The president said the administration is taking steps
recommended by a review board that investigated the Sept. 11,
2012, attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three
other Americans and has asked the Defense Department to make
sure the military is ready to respond “lightning quick” to any
threat.  To make sure embassies and other missions are secure
“we’re going to need Congress as a partner,” Obama said at a
White House news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan.  Republicans in Congress have initiated their own
investigations into the events at Benghazi and have accused the
Obama administration of attempting to cover up the involvement
of terrorist groups in the attack in the middle of a
presidential campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
