The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase crude exports this month to
meet rising demand from Asian refiners, tanker tracker Oil
Movements said.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will ship 23.87 million barrels a day in the four weeks to June
1, up from 23.65 million in the previous period to May 4, the
researcher said in an e-mailed report. The figures exclude
 Angola  and  Ecuador .  “Demand is pulling sailings up,” Roy Mason, the company’s
founder said today by phone from Halifax,  England . “The
increases are mainly heading eastbound from West Africa and the
Middle East. That makes sense because this is the peak of the
eastern season. They’ll need more crude.”  Middle East shipments will gain 1.2 percent to 17.54
million barrels a day, compared with 17.33 million during the
month to May 4, according to Oil Movements. That figure includes
non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will advance 1.1 percent to 470.54
million barrels versus 465.42 million in the previous period,
data from Oil Movements show. The researcher calculates the
volumes by tallying tanker bookings. Its figures exclude crude
held on vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
 Kuwait , Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The group will next meet on May 31 in
Vienna to discuss output policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
