Kuwait’s government reshuffled the
board of Kuwait Petroleum Corp., naming a new chief executive
officer, and suspended “leading officials” at Petrochemical
Industries Co. following a $2.19 billion compensation payment to
Dow Chemical Co.  The government’s legal body was also asked to send the Dow
Chemical contract file to the prosecution to probe, according to
a statement posted on the Cabinet website today.  The decisions were made following an extraordinary Cabinet
meeting to discuss the “massive losses resulting from this
decision,” the Cabinet said in the statement. Dow Chemical said
May 7 it received $2.19 billion from Petrochemical Industries, a
unit of KPC, as compensation for the cancellation of a joint
venture more than four years ago.  Nizar Al-Adasani was named CEO of Kuwait Petroleum,
according to the statement, replacing Farouk Al-Zanki. The PIC
officials suspended weren’t identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
