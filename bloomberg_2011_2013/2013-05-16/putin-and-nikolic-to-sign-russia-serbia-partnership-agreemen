Serbia and Russia will sign a
strategic partnership pact to bolster economic and political
ties, Belgrade newspaper  Vecernje Novosti  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The agreement, to be signed by Serbian President  Tomislav Nikolic  and Russian President  Vladimir Putin  in Sochi on May 24,
creates a “fourth formal pillar” for the Serbian foreign
policy, after the country signed strategic partnership
agreements with China, Italy and France, Novosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
