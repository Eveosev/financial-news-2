Asian Pay Television Trust , owner of
 Taiwan ’s third-largest cable television operator, raised S$1.39
billion ($1.1 billion) in an initial public offering.  The trust, which owns Taiwan Broadband Communications Co.,
sold 1.44 billion shares at S$0.97 a unit, according to a
prospectus filed with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. At
that price, the IPO is projected to offer a yield of 8.51
percent for 2014, the document shows.  The sale is part of Macquarie International Infrastructure
Fund’s planned shutdown. The Singapore-listed fund, which owned
47.5 percent of Taiwan Broadband said in April that it was
seeking at least 40.8 Singapore cents per share from a sale of
the cable operator. It is the second-biggest offering in the
city-state this year after  Mapletree Greater China Commercial
Trust (MAGIC)  raised $1.4 billion in February, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares were offered at a price of as much as S$1 and
sold to investors including Neuberger Berman LLC and Quantum
Partners LP, the prospectus shows. Taiwan Broadband, established
in 1999, serves more than 750,000 cable TV households with over
150 channels, according to its  website .  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are joint
global coordinators for the offering, and DBS Group Holdings
Ltd. and  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB)  also helped manage the IPO.
Asian Pay Television is scheduled to start trading on May 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
