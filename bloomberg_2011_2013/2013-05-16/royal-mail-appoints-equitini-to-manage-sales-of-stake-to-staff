Royal Mail  Group Ltd. said it
appointed  Equitini Group  to manage the distribution of shares in
the company to its staff when it is sold.  The government has set aside 10 percent of the company for
staff when Royal Mail is sold, something ministers say they want
to happen this year. No decision has been made yet about how or
when to sell Royal Mail, the Department for Business said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
