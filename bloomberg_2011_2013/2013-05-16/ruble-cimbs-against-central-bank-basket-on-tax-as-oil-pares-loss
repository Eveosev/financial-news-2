The ruble strengthened against Bank
Rossii’s target basket as companies bought the local currency to
pay taxes and oil pared declines.  The ruble climbed 0.2 percent against Bank Rossii’s basket
of dollars and euros to 35.4637 by 1:48 p.m. in Moscow and
advanced 0.2 percent against the dollar to 31.3975, snapping two
days of declines. Yields on benchmark OFZs due February 2027
were unchanged at 6.95 percent.  The monthly tax period continues May 20 with excise and
value-added tax payments. Brent oil traded down 0.1 percent at
$103.57 per barrel in  London , paring a retreat of as much as 0.7
percent. Oil and natural gas contribute about half of  Russia ’s
budget revenue.  “Recovering oil prices and approaching taxes will support
the ruble today,” OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  analysts led by Vladimir Kolychev
said in an e-mailed note.  Bank Rossii kept its main interest rates unchanged for an
eighth month yesterday, as forecast by 18 out 24 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The regulator reduced some mid-term and
long-term rates on refinancing, backed by gold and non-marketable assets, by 25 basis points.  “The expected rates decision hasn’t changed the balance on
the ruble market,” the Rosbank analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
