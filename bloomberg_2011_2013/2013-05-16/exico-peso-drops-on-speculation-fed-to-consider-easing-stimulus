Mexico ’s peso fell for a sixth day in
its longest losing streak since November as speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will consider scaling back its record program of
asset purchases reduced demand for emerging-market assets.  The peso depreciated 0.3 percent to 12.2368 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:10 a.m. in Mexico City, paring its rally this year to 5.1
percent, still the biggest gain among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  The peso dropped along with most emerging-market currencies
after Philadelphia Fed President  Charles Plosser  said he favors
phasing out U.S. central bank’s asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing. The Fed’s $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases to hold down borrowing costs has fueled demand for
peso-denominated assets.  “People are thinking about the Fed potentially tapering,”
 Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America foreign-exchange strategist at
Bank of Nova Scotia, said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“Slowing growth should be risk-on.”  The peso pared losses as U.S. reports showed more people
than forecast filed applications for first-time jobless benefits
last week and housing starts fell in April, encouraging some
traders to speculate that the Fed will maintain asset purchases.  The yield on peso bonds due in 2024 declined seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.63 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.74 centavo to
148.17 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
