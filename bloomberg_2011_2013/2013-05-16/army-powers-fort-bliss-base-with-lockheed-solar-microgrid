The U.S. Army switched on a solar and
battery-powered microgrid built by defense contractor  Lockheed
Martin Corp. (LMT)  to power its Fort Bliss, Texas, base.  The system includes 120 kilowatts of solar capacity and 300
kilowatts of storage, Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed said
today in a statement.  The military is seeking to reduce its dependence on
external power sources. The Fort Bliss project will help the
U.S. Defense Department meet a goal of getting 25 percent of its
energy from renewable sources by 2025.  “We are entering an age of emerging threats and cyber
warfare,” Major Joe Buccino, a Fort Bliss spokesman, said in
the statement. “This project represents the future of military
energy security.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
