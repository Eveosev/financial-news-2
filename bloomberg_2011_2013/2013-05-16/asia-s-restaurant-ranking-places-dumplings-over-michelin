The best restaurant in  Asia  is a former mom-and-pop cooking-oil shop in Taipei according to  The Daily Meal , a  U.S. food website .  Din Tai Fung has become home of some of the world’s finest xiao long bao steamed buns, according to Asia’s 101 Best Restaurants, compiled by the site headed by food writer Colman Andrews. The Top 10 is completed by five venues in Beijing, two in  Hong Kong , one in New Delhi and one in Toyako,  Japan .  “Can the birthplace of a worldwide dumpling chain really be the best restaurant in Asia?” is the question posed by Daily Meal today. “One bite of Dan Tai Fung’s xiao long bao should answer that question, in the affirmative.”  The list is based on the view of 50 restaurateurs and food writers, plus Daily Meal’s editorial staff. It’s one of at least three such rankings published in recent months which also include restaurants with Michelin stars.  L’Atelier de  Joel Robuchon  (Hong Kong), which holds three Michelin stars, placed at No. 39.  Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants awarded first place to Narisawa, in Tokyo, The Miele Guide picked Robuchon au Dome in Macau. Neither features in today’s list.
