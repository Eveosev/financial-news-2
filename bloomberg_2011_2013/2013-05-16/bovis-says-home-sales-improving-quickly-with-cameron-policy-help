Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS) , a U.K.
homebuilder, said sales are improving faster than expected this
year as government initiatives to boost homebuying start to have
an effect.  Net reservations rose 26 percent in the 19 weeks to May 10,
the Longfield, England-based company said today in a statement.
That will result in a “material increase” in home completions
in the second half, it said.  “Homebuyer sentiment has been improving,” Chief Executive
Officer David Ritchie said in the statement. “With the recently
announced government  initiatives, sales rates have increased
ahead of management’s expectations.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron  is using homebuilding to help
stimulate the economy, with the government in March announcing
that it would offer an equity loan of as much as 20 percent of
the value of a newly built home valued at 600,000 pounds
($913,000) or less. The Bank of England’s Funding for Lending
Scheme also eased home lending the government has tried to
bolster housing by simplifying planning laws.  Visitors to Bovis’s sales outlets has increased by 29
percent over last year, while selling prices and margins are
also improving, the company said.  Bovis rose as much as 3 percent to 775.5 pence in London
trading and was at 771 pence as of 8:17 a.m. The stock has
climbed 33 percent this year, the fourth-most among U.K.
homebuilders. The Bloomberg EMEA Home Builders Index has
advanced 31 percent this year, led by  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  and  Barratt
Developments Plc (BDEV)  with gains of 59 percent each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
