Zimbabwe  is trying to reach an
agreement to distribute its stones directly to  China , Dubai and
 Israel  without violating rules against the sale of gems from the
Marange fields, Chris Mutsvangwa, chairman of the state-owned
Mineral Marketing Corporation Ltd., said.  The U.S. may also get involved in discussions, Mutsvangwa
said on the sidelines of a Chamber of Mines annual meeting in
Nyanga today. The proposal wouldn’t violate rules because
Zimbabwe outside of Marange was certified compliant in 2010.  Zimbabwe, which produced 8 million carats of diamonds in
2012 worth $865 million, is the world’s seventh largest diamond
producer. Its output this year is estimated at 16 million
carats, according to Mines Minister  Obert Mpofu .  Diamond mining in Zimbabwe was mostly confined to central
and southern parts of the country and expanded to the eastern
district of Marange after the discovery of alluvial diamonds,
boosting production since 2006.  Diamonds from Marange can’t be exported legally from
Zimbabwe because the field hasn’t yet met an international
certification standard showing that proceeds from sales aren’t
used to finance conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
