Algeta ASA (ALGETA) , the Norwegian drugmaker
developing a treatment for prostate cancer with Germanyâ€™s  Bayer
AG (BAYN) , rose to a record in Oslo after winning U.S. approval for the
medication.  Algeta, based in the Norwegian capital, surged as much as
18 percent to 245.4 kroner, the  highest intraday level  since
listing in March 2007, and was up 7.7 percent as of 9:45 a.m. in
the Norwegian capital. More than 627,000 shares have traded so
far today, more than five times the three-month average daily
volume.  The  Food and Drug Administration  cleared the medicine more
than three months early for patients whose disease has spread to
their bones, the agency said yesterday. The drug, Xofigo, is
designed treat the secondary cancer that has settled in bones.  Algeta signed an agreement in 2009 for Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer to develop the treatment. The companies will co-promote the drug and split profit from sales in the U.S., Algeta
said in a statement in April 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
