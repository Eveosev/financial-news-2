Australia ’s dollar traded near an 11-month low after signs of an economic slowdown in the U.S. and
 Europe  weighed on commodity prices, dimming the outlook for the
South Pacific nation’s exports.  The yield on Australia’s benchmark three-year government
note declined one basis point to 2.59 percent after the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities extended its decline to a
fourth day yesterday, the longest in a month.  New Zealand ’s
dollar rose against all major peers ahead of the release of the
nation’s budget today.  “The Australian dollar has a little bit more room to fall
in the near term,” said Kengo Suzuki, the chief currency
strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo , a unit of  Japan ’s
third-biggest financial group by market value. “Declines in
commodity prices are negative” for the so-called Aussie.  The Australian dollar was at 99.10 U.S. cents as of 10:50
a.m. in Sydney from 98.98 yesterday, when it touched 98.52, the
weakest since June 12 last year. New Zealand’s currency climbed
0.3 percent to 82.67 U.S. cents.  The GSCI Index declined 0.1 percent yesterday, when data
showed the euro area’s gross domestic product shrank 0.2 percent
in the first three months of this year, extending a recession to
a record sixth quarter.  The U.S. Labor Department will probably say today that
applications for  unemployment  insurance payments rose to 330,000
in the week ended May 11 from 323,000 the prior week, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
