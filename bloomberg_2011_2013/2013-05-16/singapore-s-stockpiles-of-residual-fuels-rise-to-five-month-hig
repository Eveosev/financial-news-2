Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
for a third week to the highest level in more than five months,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue
and excluding bitumen gained 2.63 million barrels, or 13
percent, to 22.3 million in the seven days to yesterday,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed
statement. That’s the highest since the week ended Dec. 5.  Light-distillate stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate declined 523,000 barrels, or 5.1 percent, to 9.7
million, according to the data. Supplies fell for a second week
to the lowest level since the week ended Feb. 13.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene dropped 585,000 barrels, or 5.8 percent, to
9.5 million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies also decreased
for a second week.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
