A  Dartmouth College  student was
charged with sexually assaulting a female student on campus,
according to a court clerk in Lebanon,  New Hampshire .  Parker Gilbert, 20, was charged with four felony counts of
aggravated sexual assault, Diane Carroll, the deputy court clerk
in New Hampshire’s Second Circuit state court, said in a phone
interview.  Gilbert was arraigned yesterday in Lebanon and then
transferred to the Grafton County Jail, Carroll said. Bail was
set at $75,000.  Students at the Ivy League campus, in Hanover, New
Hampshire, held a protest last month highlighting complaints
that the school has mounted an inadequate response to sexual
assault, racism and homophobia.  Mia Ferguson, a student at Swarthmore College who has filed
a complaint against the Swarthmore, Pennsylvania-based school
with the U.S. Education Department, said that Dartmouth students
would soon be filing a similar complaint, the Dartmouth student
newspaper reported on May 14.  “Dartmouth does not comment on ongoing criminal
investigations,” Justin Anderson, a spokesman for the college,
said today in an e-mail. “However, we take all allegations of
sexual assault very seriously. We are deeply committed to
ensuring the safety and well-being of students and have
implemented numerous new and strengthened initiatives over the
past few years to reduce incidents of sexual assault, hold
accountable those found responsible, and offer as much support
and care as we can to survivors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
