Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V) , Finland’s only
refiner, said the company had been asked to provide information
to European Union officials investigating price-reporting
manipulation by some  oil companies .  “While Neste Oil is not one of the companies under
investigation, we have received a request from the European
Commission to provide information, along with other oil
companies active on the European market,” Matti Lehmus, Neste’s
executive vice president of oil products and renewables, said
today in an e-mailed statement. “We will naturally cooperate
with this request.”  The investigation relates to price-reporting for oil and
biofuels to Platts, the energy news and data unit of McGraw Hill
Financial Inc. Statoil ASA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc are
part of the probe.  Statoil is taking the investigation “very seriously” and
cooperating to the best of its ability, Chief Executive Officer
 Helge Lund  said yesterday, adding he had been given “very
limited” information about which products and markets were
under scrutiny.  Shell and BP also said they were assisting the commission
in its enquiry into trading activities.  EPure, a group that represents renewable ethanol producers
in  Europe , said today that the industry wasn’t under
investigation and that no ethanol company had been raided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
