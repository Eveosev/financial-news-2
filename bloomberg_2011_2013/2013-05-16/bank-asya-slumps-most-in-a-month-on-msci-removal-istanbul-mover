Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB)  slumped the
most in a month after  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) , whose gauges are tracked by
investors managing about $7 trillion, decided to remove the
Islamic lender from its Turkey index.  The  shares  of Bank Asya, as the company is known, dropped
3.2 percent, the biggest decline since April 18, to 2.15 liras
at 2:40 p.m. in Istanbul. About 16.4 million shares traded, or
1.3 times the stock’s three-month daily average. The  Borsa
Istanbul National 100 (XU100)  index fell 0.2 percent.  The change in the MSCI Turkey index is effective as of the
close on May 31, the New York-based provider of indexes and
portfolio analytics said in a statement on its website
yesterday. Bank Asya this month reported a 10 percent decline in
first-quarter net income to 45 million liras ($25 million).  “Investors are betting that the funds tracking the index
will reduce their exposure,” Murat Borekci, an analyst at Yapi
Kredi Yatirim in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments today.
Borekci, who recommends investors hold the shares, has a 12-month price estimate of 2.5 liras on Bank Asya.  Bank Asya  trades  at 7.5 times estimated 12-month earnings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a
multiple of 8 for Istanbul-based  Albaraka Turk Katilim Bankasi
AS (ALBRK) , and 10 for  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Six analysts recommend buying the shares of Bank Asya,
while nine say hold and four recommend selling them, the  data 
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
