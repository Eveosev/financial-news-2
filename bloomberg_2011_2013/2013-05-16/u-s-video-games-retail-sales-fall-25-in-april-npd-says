U.S. retail sales of video-game
hardware, software and accessories fell 25 percent to $495.2
million last month, as consumers shifted to digital titles
played on mobile devices and awaited next-generation consoles.  Hardware sales fell the most, declining 42 percent to
$109.5 million, compared with a year ago, Port Washington, New
York-based NPD Group Inc. said in an e-mailed statement today.
Software sales for the current generation consoles fell 17
percent to $254.3 million.  Sales of packaged game products are sinking as more
consumers download games on smartphones and tablet. Gamers also
are delaying purchases before  Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
introduce their new consoles expected at the end of this year.
Physical sales accounted for about 50 percent of total U.S.
consumer spending on games, NPD said.  The industry hasn’t seen a month of growth on a weekly
comparison basis since November 2011, and probably won’t show
sustained gains until next year,  Michael Pachter , an analyst at
Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, wrote on May 13 in a research
report.  Total spending on U.S. video-game hardware and software,
including used games, rentals and digitally delivered content,
was $802 million, said Liam Callahan, an NPD analyst.  Microsoft said U.S. retailers sold 130,000 Xbox 360
consoles last month, a decline of 45 percent from 236,000 a year
earlier. The company, based in Redmond, Washington, held its
spot with the No. 1 selling model in April, and has scheduled a
May 21 announcement to reveal details of its next-generation
machine.  Video-game makers voluntarily report their sales tallies.
 Nintendo Co. (7974)  and Sony don’t typically release monthly figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
