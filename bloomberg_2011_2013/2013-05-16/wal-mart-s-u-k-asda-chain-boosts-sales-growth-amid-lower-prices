Asda, the U.K. supermarket chain
owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , said sales growth improved in the
first quarter as it cut prices and sold more products online.  Sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.3 percent from
a year earlier, excluding fuel and value-added tax, the Leeds,
England-based retailer said today in an e-mailed statement.
Same-store revenue gained 0.1 percent in the previous quarter.  “This represents a strong performance in what remains a
very tough market,” Chief Executive Officer  Andy Clarke  said in
the statement. “Low prices are who we are and are what drive
real loyalty. We are unwavering in this commitment.”  The U.K.’s second-largest grocer is maintaining its share
of the market amid growing competition from discounters Aldi and
Lidl and more upscale competitors such as Waitrose or  J
Sainsbury Plc. (SBRY)  Sainsbury was the only one of Britain’s four
biggest grocers to win market share in the 12 weeks ended April
14, according to data from researcher  Kantar Worldpanel . Asda’s
share eased to 17.5 percent from 17.6 percent a year earlier.  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, today forecast
second-quarter profit that was less than analysts estimated as
shoppers struggle amid the slow  U.S. economy  and higher taxes.  Earnings per share will be $1.22 to $1.27, the Bentonville,
Arkansas-based company said today. Analysts had projected $1.29,
the average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
