Ultra-low-sulfur diesel rose as
gasoil gained in Europe on speculation refineries may reduce
operating rates, limiting production.  Futures rose as much as 0.9 percent as gasoil on ICE
Futures Europe Exchange in  London  jumped 2.2 percent. Stronger
gasoil increases the incentive for refiners to export production
to Europe from the U.S. Gulf Coast. Crack spreads widened.  “We’re still hearing that there are run cuts in Europe and
that is propping up gasoil,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market
strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company in London.  ULSD for June delivery rose 0.92 cent, or 0.3 percent, to
$2.8893 a gallon at 10:20 a.m. on the New York Mercantile

Brent  crude gained 56 cents to $17.84.  Gasoil for delivery in June advanced $18.75 to $865.50 a

U.K., have reduced production on declining margins, Miswin
Mahesh, an analyst at Barclays in London, said in an e-mailed
research note on May 10.  Gasoline gained as Colonial Pipeline Co. stopped accepting
deliveries from refineries near Houston after a gasoline leak
yesterday, which may limit deliveries into New York Harbor.  East Coast  “This matters for deliveries along the East Coast up to
New York because all the Houston origins are shut out of
Colonial,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 0.46 cent to $2.8716 a
