Japan Asia Group Ltd. (3751) , a developer of
clean energy projects, said plans to develop 500 megawatts of
solar projects in  Japan  are moving ahead while it considers
trimming European operations.  The Tokyo-based company plans 110 megawatts for the year
ending March 31, Tetsuo Yamashita, chairman of the company, said
at a meeting with analysts today. About 190 megawatts are
proposed for fiscal 2014 and about 200 megawatts the following
year, he said.  “Our plan is going very well,” Yamashita said, adding
that the company intends to announce large-size projects at the
end of June. The 500-megawatt plan includes about 100 megawatts
to be developed for clients, according to the company.  Japan Asia’s green energy division, which is responsible
for clean energy projects, posted a loss of 343 million yen
($3.4 million) for the year ended March 31. The company, which
includes a brokerage and aerial surveyor under its businesses,
projects no profit for the division this fiscal year.  Japan’s solar market is booming on an incentive program for
clean energy introduced in July to increase power generation
from renewable sources such as solar and wind after the 2011
Fukushima nuclear disaster.  European Operations  Yamashita said that his company may trim its solar business
in  Europe  though a decision is yet to be made. Japan Asia has
developed 24 solar plants in Europe, according to its  website.   The company may make an announcement in June or July about
how to finance some of its solar projects, the chairman said.
Japan Asia received a 1.6 billion yen loan for five solar
projects from  Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303)  and Mitsubishi UFJ Lease &
Finance Company Ltd., the company said in a statement in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
