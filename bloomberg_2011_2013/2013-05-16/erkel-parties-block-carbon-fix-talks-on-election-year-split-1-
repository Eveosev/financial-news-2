German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that she views the U.K. as an “important member of the European
Union” and will lobby “our British friends” to stay in the
bloc.  “It’s my firm conviction that we belong together, the U.K.
and the other European member states,” Merkel said in an
interview with Germany’s WDR television in Berlin today. She
said that she follows the U.K.’s political debate on relations
with the rest of the EU.  Lawmakers from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s  Conservative
Party  voted against the government’s legislative agenda on May
14 to express dissatisfaction with the fact that the Queen’s
Speech last week laying out the agenda didn’t include a
provision for a referendum on EU membership.  “I see this debate as being about procedural questions
right now,” Merkel said. “For my part, I will tell my British
friends again and again that it’s good for you and it’s good for
us” if the U.K. stays in the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
