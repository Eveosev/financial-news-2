(Corrects company name in first paragraph of story
published May 16.)  PPC Ltd. (PPC) ,  South Africa ’s biggest
cement maker, said first-half profit fell 20% as a result of tax
charges and costs associated with complying with Zimbabwe’s
ownership laws.  Net income for the six months through March declined to 295
million rand ($31.9 million) compared with 369 million rand a
year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Revenue increased 8 percent to 3.81 billion rand from
3.53 million rand. The company will pay an interim dividend of
38 cents for the six months, unchanged from a year ago.  PPC, which has annual production capacity of eight million
tons, is expanding in  Africa  through acquisitions to offset
tougher competition in its domestic market. It sold 650 million
rand worth of three-year bonds in March to help fund the plan.  Cement sales in  Zimbabwe  and South Africa increased in the
review period, PPC Chief Executive Officer Ketso Gordhan said in
the statement. “This encouraging trend was, however, tempered
by weakness in cement sales in Botswana as well as lower demand
in the lime and aggregate divisions.”  The  stock  declined 0.1 percent to close close at 34.74 rand
in Johannesburg yesterday, giving the company a market value of
21 billion rand. PPC shares have gained 1.6 percent this year,
compared with a 4.5 percent rise in the  FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index. (JALSH)   To contact the reporter on this story:
