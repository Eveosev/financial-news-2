Southeastern Asset Management Inc.,
the  money manager  that is the largest outside investor of  Dell
Inc. (DELL) , said it exercised 25 million call options in the computer
maker, giving it more shares to vote in the upcoming fight over
the company’s future.  Southeastern, which has an 8.2 percent stake in Dell,
exercised the options May 15, boosting the shares over which it
has voting authority to 146 million, the Memphis, Tennessee-based firm said today in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The move does not affect Southeastern’s
ownership stake in Dell, the firm said.  Southeastern last week teamed up with billionaire  Carl Icahn  to offer Dell shareholders $12 a share in cash or stock,
while also letting them retain stakes in a public company.
Founder  Michael Dell  and Silver Lake Management LLC have
proposed a buyout at $13.65 in cash.  A call option gives the holder the right to buy securities
at a specific price within a given time.  Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, today reported fiscal
first-quarter  earnings  that missed analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
