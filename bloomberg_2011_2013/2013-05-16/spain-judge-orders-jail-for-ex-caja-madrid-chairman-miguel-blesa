A Spanish judge ordered that Miguel Blesa, the former chairman of  Caja Madrid , be put in jail amid a
probe into alleged irregularities relating to the lender’s
purchase of a bank in the U.S.  A Madrid regional court judge set Blesa’s bail at 2.5
million euros ($3.2 million), according to an e-mailed statement
from the court today.  Judge Elpidio Silva said Blesa, 65, should be detained as
he investigates Caja Madrid’s purchase of City National Bank of
Florida in 2008 in a deal valued at more than $900 million.  Caja Madrid merged with Bancaja and five other savings
banks in 2010 to form  Bankia (BKIA) , a banking group that needed a 22
billion-euro rescue last year that forced Spain to seek bailout
funds from Europe to salvage its banking industry.  Blesa’s lawyer Carlos Aguilar didn’t immediately to respond
to a phone message left by  Bloomberg News  today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
