Volkswagen AG (VOW)  began construction of a
new factory in Changsha,  China , as part of plans to increase
manufacturing capacity in the world’s biggest auto market.  The plant, with an annual capacity of about 300,000
vehicles, is scheduled for completion by the end of 2015,
Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen, Europe’s largest automaker,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We are expanding our capacity in China to 4 million
vehicles per year by 2018 in order to meet demand from our
Chinese customers,”  Jochem Heizmann , head of Volkswagen’s
operations in China, said in the statement.  The announcement follows comments by Volkswagen that it had
no intention of building a factory in the city, located in the
south-central province of Hunan. The Changsha plant is one of
seven factories being built by Volkswagen as part of a 9.8
billion-euro ($13 billion) investment in China, whose auto
association projects new-vehicle sales will top 20 million units
this year.  Bloomberg News reported the automaker’s plan for the
Changsha plant on Oct. 23, citing a request for public feedback
on the plant by the Hunan Research Academy of Environmental
Sciences and investment figures from the Changsha National
Economic & Technical Development Zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
