CAE Inc. (CAE)  climbed the most in 19
months after the maker of flight simulators reported a record
backlog and quarterly profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  CAE gained 6.2 percent to C$11.26 by the 4 p.m. close of
trading in Toronto, its biggest single-day increase since Aug.
9, 2011.  Excluding one-time items, profit in the fiscal fourth
quarter was 21 cents a share, Montreal-based CAE said today,
beating the 18-cent average of 15  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue in the three months through March jumped 16
percent to C$587.9 million ($578.9 million), while the backlog
of future orders rose 9.9 percent to a record C$4.09 billion.
It’s the first time in CAE’s history that the backlog exceeds
C$4 billion, Chief Executive Officer Marc Parent said.  “We are encouraged by the fact that CAE has a record total
company backlog,”  Cameron Doerksen , an analyst at National Bank
Financial in  Montreal , said today in a note to clients. He has
the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
