Nordstrom Inc. (JWN)  dropped after the
department-store chain posted first-quarter revenue that trailed
analysts’ estimates and cut its sales forecast for the year.  Nordstrom fell 2.7 percent to $59.45 at 4:42 p.m. after
regular trading ended in  New York . The  shares  had gained 14
percent this year before today’s close, compared with a 16
percent advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Revenue increased 4.7 percent to $2.75 billion, the company
said today in a statement. Analysts had estimated $2.81 billion
on average. Sales at stores open at least a year will rise 5
percent at the most in the current fiscal, Nordstrom said. In
February, it projected a maximum of 5.5 percent.  Nordstrom, which has more than 100 namesake stores,
suffered “particularly soft” sales in the first two months of
the quarter in seasonal merchandise and geographically in the
Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, the Seattle-based
retailer said. Overall sales trends showed improvement in April,
it said.  Net income in the first quarter ended May 4 dropped 2.7
percent to $145 million, or 73 cents a share, from $149 million,
or 70 cents, a year earlier, Nordstrom said. Analysts projected
76 cents, the average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings per share in 2013 will be $3.65 to $3.80, the
retailer reaffirmed, helped by 5 cents by share repurchases.
Analysts projected $3.80, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
