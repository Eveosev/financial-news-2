Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
gauge retreating from a five-year high, as a drop in Japanese
banks after forecasting lower earnings offset a report that
 Japan ’s economy expanded faster than analysts estimated.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. sank 3.6 percent,
leading Japanese lenders lower. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co., South Korea’s third-biggest shipbuilder, fell
10 percent as first-quarter profit plunged.  Tokyo  Electric Power
Co. surged 19 percent, leading Japanese utilities higher.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.4 percent to 142.61 as
of 5:39 p.m. in Tokyo. About 10 shares fell for every nine that
rose on the measure. The gauge increased 11 percent this year
through yesterday as the Bank of Japan took steps to counter
deflation and policy makers in the U.S. and  Europe  remained on
standby to buoy growth.  “The market, particularly in Japan, looks overbought and
needs a pullback,” Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic
 asset allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
$126 billion, said by phone. “We’re not going to see a full
reversal at this stage. The effects of aggressive monetary
stimulus in Japan is just starting to gain traction.”  Japan’s Nikkei 255 Stock Average dropped 0.4 percent, after
yesterday closing at the highest level since December 2007. The
broader Topix Index fell 0.6 percent, after earlier rising as
much as 0.5 percent. The 14-day  relative strength index , a
measure of trading momentum, has held above 70 for both gauges,
a level some traders say signals a sell-off.  Japan GDP  The Nikkei 225 and the Topix both climbed about 45 percent
this year as the  Bank of Japan  introduced unprecedented monetary
easing and the  U.S. economy  showed recovery signs.  Japan’s gross domestic product rose an annualized 3.5
percent in the three months through March, the most in a year,
the Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo. The median of 36
economists’ forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey was for 2.7
percent. Fourth-quarter growth was revised to 1 percent.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.5 percent, while South
Korea’s Kospi index advanced 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index added 0.2 percent and  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.2 percent.  Shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 14.4 times
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 21 for the  Nikkei
225 (NKY) , 15 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.4 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The index rose 0.5 percent to a fresh record in  New York 
yesterday after data showing weakness in manufacturing fueled
bets the  Federal Reserve  will be in no hurry to scale back
stimulus. Industrial production declined in April by the most in
eight months.  Japanese lenders declined as companies from Mitsubishi UFJ,
the country’s biggest publicly traded lender by market value, to
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. forecast earnings will drop
this year as monetary easing makes loans less profitable even as
borrowing picks up amid an economic recovery.  Mitsubishi UFJ slipped 3.6 percent to 706 yen.  Sumitomo
Mitsui  lost 3 percent 4,770 yen. Mizuho Financial Group Inc.
declined 3.1 percent to 219 yen.  Daewoo Shipbuilding slumped 10 percent to 25,600 won in
 Seoul , the most on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The company
reported yesterday that first-quarter net income plunged 42
percent from a year earlier to 48.9 billion won ($43.9 million).
Macquarie Group Ltd. reduced its rating on the stock to neutral
from outperform.  Earnings Performance  Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd., the nation’s second-largest
carrier, dropped 17 percent to 38 Australian cents in Sydney
after forecasting that annual profit would slip for the third
time in five years.  Of the 475 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
reported results since the beginning of April and for which
estimates are available, 53 percent are exceeded expectations,
while 47 percent fell short, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Among stocks that advanced,  Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. (8750) ,
Japan’s second-largest life insurer, climbed 3.9 percent to
161,600 yen in Tokyo after projecting a 14 percent profit
increase and announcing a 100-for-1 stock split.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  surged 18 percent to 3,215 yen in Tokyo after
the maker of digital cameras and endoscopes projected profit
that topped analyst estimates.  Tepco (9501)  jumped 19 percent to 613 yen, the biggest advance in
the Asian gauge. The stock is heading for 37 percent advance
this week after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was quoted by the
Yomiuri newspaper on May 14 as saying Japan’s biggest power
utility shouldn’t take full blame for the Fukushima nuclear
meltdowns. Eurus Energy Holdings Corp., a joint venture between
Tepco and Toyota Tsusho Corp., yesterday announced plans to
build a 115-megawatt solar power station in northern Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
