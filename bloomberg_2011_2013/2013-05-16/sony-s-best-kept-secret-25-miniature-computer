It won't be enough to squash  mounting breakup pressure , but Sony has a new hit from an unexpected place: a $25 miniature computer whose popularity is surging among tech hobbyists. As Bloomberg Television's Tom Gibson  reports , inventors and tinkerers are smitten with Sony's Raspberry Pi device, which is really just a small circuit board and crude casing. The company expects to make its millionth device by July. The Pi is being used in all kinds of robotics, allowing do-it-yourselfers a cheap way to add computer functionality to their inventions, from motion sensors to supercomputers.  Now if only Sony could create a robot to go back in time and reclaim some of the $100 billion the company has lost in market value since 2000. Now  that  would be impressive.
