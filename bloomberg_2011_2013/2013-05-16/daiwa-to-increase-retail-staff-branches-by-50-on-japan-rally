Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) ,  Japan ’s
second-largest brokerage, plans to increase the number of
bankers at its retail branches by 50 percent over the next few
years as the stock market rally boosts demand from households.  Outlets will increase by about half over the same period,
Chief Executive Officer Takashi Hibino said at a meeting with
analysts and investors in Tokyo today. Daiwa has between 3,000
and 4,000 consultants at its 123 branches in Japan, and will
increase headcount mainly by allocating graduates, he said.  “Japan is the most exciting market,” said Hibino, 57,
adding that it offers “unprecedented” business opportunities.  The remarks underscore the turnaround in fortunes for
Tokyo-based Daiwa and larger rival  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  since
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in December on a pledge to
end deflation. The  Topix Securities and Commodity Futures Index 
has almost tripled in the past six months in anticipation that
higher trading volume will spur revenue.  Shares of Daiwa have soared 184 percent over that period.
They fell 1.3 percent to 989 yen at the close of trading in
Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 0.4 percent from the
highest level since December 2007 to 15,037.24.  Speaking after the meeting, Hibino predicted that the
Nikkei 225 will climb to 18,000 by the year’s end as long as the
yen remains weak. Japan’s currency touched 102.76 against the
dollar yesterday, the lowest since October 2008.  Hibino said Daiwa has finished restructuring operations
outside of Japan. The bank has been cutting costs and
eliminating jobs abroad as part of a 70 billion yen expense
reduction program.  Daiwa, the No. 1 underwriter for Japanese stocks this year,
reported its highest quarterly profit since 2006 earlier this
month, as commissions and underwriting fees jumped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
