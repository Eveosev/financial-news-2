Statoil ASA (STL)  Chief Executive Officer
 Helge Lund  said the company, which the European Union is
investigating for possible violation of EU competition law, has
“zero tolerance” for breaches of the rules.  “We invest a huge amount of time in training our people to
follow all the applicable rules and regulations in safety, in
anti-corruption, in anti-competition and so on,” Lund said at a
business conference in Brussels today. “We have zero tolerance
for any breaches of those rules.”  Norway-based Statoil is among three of Europe’s biggest oil
explorers -- along with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  BP Plc (BP/)  --
being probed by EU regulators about potential manipulation of
prices in the $3.4 trillion-a-year global crude market. Platts,
the oil-price data collector owned by  McGraw Hill Financial
Inc. (MHFI) , is also a target in the inquiry.  Statoil said earlier this week that the suspected
violations relate to prices published by Platts, which publishes
benchmark prices used to determine the costs refiners pay for
crude oil and distributors pay for diesel fuel and gasoline.
Traders report transactions to Platts. Those deals, rather than
a complete record of all trades, are used to determine the
price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
