Gold, down 17 percent since January,
is poised to lose 20 percent in a year as inflation fails to
accelerate and with the worst risks to the global economy
waning, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Gold will trade at $1,100 an ounce in a year and below
$1,000 in five years, according to Ric Deverell, head of
commodities research at the bank. Lower prices are unlikely to
lure more central-bank buying, said Deverell, who worked at the
Reserve Bank of  Australia  for 10 years before joining Credit
Suisse in 2010.  “Gold is going to get crushed,” Deverell told reporters
in London today. “The need to buy gold for wealth preservation
fell down and the probability of inflation on a one- to three-year horizon is significantly diminished.”  Investors are losing faith in the world’s traditional store
of value even as central banks continue to print money on an
unprecedented scale. Bullion slumped into the bear market last
month after a 12-year bull market that saw prices rise as much
as sevenfold. Gold is a “wounded bull,” Credit Suisse said in
a Jan. 3 report.  Bullion for immediate delivery traded at $1,389.15 by 6:40
p.m. in  London . Gold prices reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce
in 2011.  Gold may slip to $1,350 in the next couple weeks, Deverell
said. The metal is still too expensive relative to other “real
assets” such as base metals, according to Credit Suisse. The
bank said bullion may peak in 2013 in a December report.  While central banks have a broad strategic plan to
diversify reserves, their managers wouldn’t want to lose money
if gold enters a period of declines, Deverell said.  Central Banks  Combined gold reserves held by central banks have risen to
an eight-year high as nations from  Russia  to Kazakhstan to
Mongolia expanded holdings, the International Monetary Fund data
show. The banks bought 534.6 metric tons last year, the most
since 1964, and may add as much as 550 tons in 2013, the World
Gold Council estimates.  “When gold is going up, it looks like a great idea to buy
more gold,” Deverell said. “And when it’s going down, do you
really think risk-averse central bankers are going to try and
catch the knife? No.”  Gold has the worst 12-month outlook among commodities and
will trade below $1,400 in a year, according to investors polled
by Credit Suisse in London on May 15. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said April 23 bullion may slide to $1,390 in 12 months, and
Deutsche Bank AG predicts a drop to as low as $1,050.  U.S. Mint  A surge in demand for bars, coins and jewelry following
gold’s drop to a two-year low in April is temporary, Deverell
said. The U.S. Mint said April 23 it ran out of its smallest
gold coins and Australia’s Perth Mint said volumes jumped to a
five-year high.  India ’s bullion imports may surge 47 percent to
225 tons in the second quarter to meet consumer buying,
according to the All India Gems & Jewelery Trade Federation.  “This is bargain-buying,” Deverell said. “It’s like when
you have cash for clunkers in autos, you bring forward activity,
but it’s not a massive addition to buying.’  To contact the reporter on this story:
