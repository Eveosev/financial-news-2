Indian bonds gained, sending the 10-year yield to a three-year low, on speculation the central bank
will cut  interest rates  again amid easing inflation.  The wholesale-price  index  rose 4.89 percent in April, the
least in 41 months, the government reported this week, prompting
 Reserve Bank  of  India  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao to say the data
will be factored into decisions at the next meeting on June 17.
The central bank last lowered the repurchase  rate  by 25 basis
points to 7.25 percent on May 3, the third reduction this year.  “Some investors are expecting more rate cuts, driving
yields lower,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, the Mumbai-based
executive vice president of treasury at  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK) 
“There might be some correction at these levels as bonds have
rallied quite a bit.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.44 percent as
of 9:44 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year bond
since June 2010.  “We certainly will take note of the softening of inflation
and the external payments situation in the next mid-quarter
policy,” Subbarao said in Frankfurt on May 14.  Foreign funds boosted their holdings of rupee-denominated
debt by $76.3 million to a record $37.8 billion on May 14,
Securities & Exchange Board of India data show.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.10 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
