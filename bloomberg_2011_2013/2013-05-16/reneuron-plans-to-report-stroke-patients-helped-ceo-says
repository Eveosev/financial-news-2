ReNeuron Group Plc (RENE)  Chief Executive
Officer Michael Hunt said he expects researchers to report that
people disabled by strokes showed progress and weren’t harmed in
an early-stage test of the company’s stem-cell treatment.  Doctors conducting the trial at Southern General Hospital
in Glasgow,  Scotland , plan to present the “encouraging data”
from the first nine patients studied at a conference in London
this month, Hunt said at an investors’  meeting  yesterday. The
patients showed improvement on several measures in the first
year, Hunt said.  “We see sustained reductions in neurological impairment
and modified spasticity in most patients,” Hunt said. “There’s
a nice trend downward over time. It sets us up nicely for a
Phase 2 efficacy trial.”  ReNeuron began the safety trial more than two years ago
after obtaining permission from U.K. regulators. There aren’t
any treatments to reverse the disability caused by strokes,
which occur when there is a sudden loss of blood to the brain.
Every year, about 5 million people worldwide are disabled by
strokes, according to the  World Health Organization  in Geneva.  Shares of Guildford, England-based ReNeuron have climbed 40
percent this year and traded up 3.7 percent at 2.80 pence at
11:28 a.m. in  London , giving the company a market value of 21.7
million pounds ($33 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
