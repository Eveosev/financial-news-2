Steel reinforcement-bar futures
traded near the lowest level in more than five months amid
rising output in  China  and as  iron ore  fell into a bear market.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.8 percent to 3,526  yuan  ($573) a
metric ton, the lowest since Dec. 3, and was at 3,562 at 10:54
a.m. local time. The most-active contract has retreated 11
percent this year.  China’s crude steel output rose to 65.65 million tons in
April, up 6.8 percent from a year earlier, data from the
National Bureau of Statistics showed today. Crude steel
production in the first four months increased 8.4 percent from a
year ago to 258.2 million tons, according to the data.  “April was the second-highest level of output on record,
so the supply is a concern as mills don’t want to cut back on
production,” Cai Yuehui, an analyst at Ruida Futures Co., said
by phone from Fujian.  Iron ore slumped into a  bear market  on concern that slowing
economic growth in China will reduce demand as global supplies
increase. Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the
Chinese port of Tianjin fell 1.3 percent yesterday to $126.40 a
ton, down 20 percent from since Feb. 20 when it reached a 16-month high of $158.90.  The average  spot price  for rebar was unchanged at 3,579
yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
