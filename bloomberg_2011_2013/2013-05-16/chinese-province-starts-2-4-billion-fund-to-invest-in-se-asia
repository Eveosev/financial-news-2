Highland Capital Management, a
company formed by the government of China’s Yunnan province,
will raise as much as 15 billion  yuan  ($2.4 billion) to invest
in real estate and natural resources in  Southeast Asia .  The fund, launched jointly with the Financial Supervisory
Board of Yunnan, is raising capital from financial institutions
and state-owned enterprises, Highland said in a statement
yesterday. Daniel Zhou, a former director of the investment-banking division at UBS Investment Bank AG, will lead the fund,
it said. Yunnan is in southwestern China,  “This focus builds on Yunnan Province’s geographical
proximity and its strong business ties to” Southeast Asia, the
investment firm said in the statement. “The management
recognizes this as a strategic opportunity for Chinese
investment and the development of Yunnan as a regional yuan
financial center.”  Highland Capital will manage China’s second offshore yuan
fund. Sailing Capital International Co.’s investment arm was
launched in February 2012 and is managing 50 billion yuan of
assets, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
