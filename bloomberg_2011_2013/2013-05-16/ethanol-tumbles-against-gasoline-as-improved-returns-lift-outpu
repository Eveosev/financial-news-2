Ethanol declined against gasoline on
speculation higher returns for making the fuel from corn will
spur companies to boost output.  The discount, or price difference, widened 5.93 cents to
29.23 cents a gallon at 11:16 a.m. New York time, the largest
differential since May 6. An Energy Information Administration
report yesterday showed  production  climbed to a two-week high.
The corn crush spread, or the difference between the cost of a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, has been above
break-even for the longest stretch since 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’ll probably continue to see that production number
creep up here,” said  Chris Wilson , an analyst at Atten Babler
Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “With these margins,
plants are turning on. We’re starting to increase run rates and
capacity.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery decreased 1.8 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.616 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 21 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery added 4.13 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.9083 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn Falls  Corn prices have eased since reaching a record high during
last year’s drought, and that’s decreased production costs for
ethanol manufacturers, Wilson said.  One bushel of the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol. About 34 percent of this year’s corn crop will be used
to make the fuel, the Agriculture Department said in a May 10
report.  Corn for July delivery slipped 9.75 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $6.41 a bushel in Chicago.  The corn crush spread for July was 18 cents, compared with
15 cents yesterday and minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The amount
doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’
grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to
livestock.  Ethanol output climbed 1.7 percent to 857,000 barrels a day
in the week ended May 10, the highest since April 26 and up 11
percent from the record low 770,000 barrels a day in January,
the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said.  Corn-based ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers  for
2013, or RINs, jumped 0.6 percent to 84 cents as of 11:23 a.m.
 New York  time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs,
which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol,
declined 1.1 percent to 90 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
