England  was 160-4 after 80 overs when
rain caused play to be abandoned on the first Test with New
Zealand at Lord’s in London.  Jonathan Trott was the top scorer, with 39 runs, when he
was caught by Dean Brownlie off Trent Boult, who took 2-29. Joe
Root, on 25, and Jonny Bairstow, on 3, were batting when play
was completed for the day.  The visitors are trying to win their first Test series in
England since 1999, which is also the last time they won at
Lord’s. Peter Fulton and Hamish Rutherford will open the batting
for New Zealand.  The two-match series continues at Leeds on May 24. The
teams drew 0-0 in their three-match series in  New Zealand . They
also will play three one-day Internationals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
