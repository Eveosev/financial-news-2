England  reached 56-1 at lunch of the
first Test against  New Zealand  at Lord’s Cricket Ground in
London.  Captain  Alastair Cook  made 30 and Jonathan Trott got off
the mark with a boundary before the break. Trott replaced Nick
Compton, who was caught off left-armed spinner Bruce Martin on
16.  The visitors are trying to win their first Test series in
England since 1999, which is also the last time they won at
Lord’s. Peter Fulton and Hamish Rutherford will open the batting
for New Zealand.  The two-match series continues at Leeds on May 24. The
teams drew 0-0 in their three-match series in New Zealand. They
also will play three one-day Internationals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
