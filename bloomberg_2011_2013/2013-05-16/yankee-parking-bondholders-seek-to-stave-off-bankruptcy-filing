Holders of almost $240 million of
municipal debt issued to finance parking garages at the new
Yankee Stadium and the operator of the facility agreed to
prevent an immediate bankruptcy filing.  Owners of a majority of the debt said they wouldn’t sue
Bronx Parking Development Corp. to enforce their claims on
revenue or seek an acceleration of payments, according to a
 securities filing  today.  The garages and lots, which have about 9,300 spaces, have
suffered as more fans take public transportation to Major League
Baseball games and drivers balk at paying $35 to park. The
facilities averaged about 4,000 cars on event days and had an
occupancy rate of 43 percent, according to filings. The  New York
Yankees  have exclusive use of 600 spaces.  Bronx Parking in March disclosed that it was hiring Willkie
Farr & Gallagher as bankruptcy counsel.  The bondholders and Bronx Parking agreed to terminate the
so-called forbearance agreement on Aug. 1, according to the
filing. It could end earlier if the operator fails to reach an
accord with the Yankees by July 15 to better promote the garages
to fans or if Bronx Parking files for bankruptcy, according to
the filing.  The marketing arrangement needs to be acceptable to
bondholders.  Nuveen Asset Management is the biggest holder of Bronx
Parking debt, with a combined $116.1 million of bonds maturing
in 2037 and 2046 as of Feb. 28, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Chicago-based company held $15 million in bonds
maturing in 2017 and 2027 as of Jan. 31.  Kathleen Cardoza, a Nuveen spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  Bronx Parking missed a $6.9 million interest payment on
April 1. The corporation had about $13.5 million in funds as of
Dec. 31, which will decline to about $6 million at the end of
2013, according to the budget. Net operating income is forecast
at $4.8 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
