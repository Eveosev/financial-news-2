The following is the text of
 Canada â€™s international transactions report for March
released by  Statistics Canada .  Non-resident investors acquired $1.2 billion of Canadian
securities in March, led by investment in government bonds.
Acquisitions of bonds were largely moderated by continued
reductions in foreign holdings of money market instruments.  Meanwhile, Canadian investors added $3.8 billion of foreign
securities to their holdings, following a $4.3 billion
acquisition in February.  Foreign investment in the Canadian  bond market  focuses on
government instruments  Foreign investment in Canadian bonds slowed for a second
straight month, reaching $5.2 billion in March. On a sector
basis, non residents acquired government bonds at a similar pace
than in February, while their acquisitions of corporate bonds
slowed.  Foreign acquisitions of  government bonds  were $4.3 billion
in March, led by secondary market purchases of instruments with
short to medium-term maturities. Non-resident investors also
added $0.9 billion of Canadian corporate bonds to their holdings,
reflecting fewer net new issues for a second consecutive month.
Acquisitions of federal government enterprise bonds were partly
offset by a divestment in private corporate bonds. Overall,
foreign investors accumulated $25.2 billion of Canadian bonds in
the first quarter of 2013.  Foreign investors withdrew $3.4 billion from the Canadian
money market in March. Foreign holdings of federal paper were
down for a third straight month despite an increase in the
overall supply of these instruments. Provincial government and
private corporate paper also contributed to the reduction over
the month.  Non-resident holdings of Canadian equities edge lower  Foreign portfolio investors sold $0.6 billion of Canadian
equities in March, following an $11.6 billion reduction in their
holdings in February that was largely attributable to merger and
acquisition activity. The divestment in March mainly focused on
Canadian energy, gold, and banking shares. Canadian stock prices
edged down 0.6% after three months of increases.  Canadian investment in foreign securities evenly split between
bonds and equity  Canadian investors added $2.0 billion of foreign equities
to their holdings in March, led by demand from pension funds.

markets in March. In addition, Canadians sold $0.4 billion of US
equities after four straight months of investment. US stock
prices increased 3.6% in March and 10% in the first quarter of
