Italian and Swiss authorities are
searching offices in the two countries as part of a money-laundering probe involving former managers of  Banca Monte dei
Paschi di Siena SpA , court officials said.  Swiss police are conducting searches in Lugano, said
Saverio Snider, a spokesman for Lugano prosecutor Natalia
Ferrara Micocci, who declined to give additional details.  Today’s searches in  Italy  may lead to other individuals
being placed under investigation for money laundering, said a
Siena court official, who asked not be identified because he
wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.  Monte Paschi’s former managers, including ex-finance chief
Gianluca Baldassarri, are being investigated in Siena for false
accounting, market manipulation, criminal association as well as
money laundering. The managers allegedly hid losses by carrying
out transactions in 2008 and 2009.  Baldassarri’s repatriation of “substantial” sums in 2009
and 2010 led to an investigation of Monte Paschi’s finance
department and an inquiry into the bank’s use of complex
financial transactions that may have also led bankers to make
illicit profits, a March court document shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
