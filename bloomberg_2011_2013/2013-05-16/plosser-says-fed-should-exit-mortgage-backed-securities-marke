President  Charles Plosser  said he favors phasing out the Fed’s
purchases of mortgage-backed securities.  “It’s not good for the bank to be holding lots of mortgage
paper” and “I would like to see us get out of mortgage-backed
securities,” Plosser said in an interview with Manus Cranny on
Bloomberg Television in Milan today. “But that’s not going to
happen very quickly.”  The pace of withdrawal “is something we’ll have to
discuss,” Plosser said, adding that “at the end of the day,
we’re going to do what’s best for the  U.S. economy .”  Plosser, who doesn’t vote on the  Federal Open Market
Committee  until 2014, is in favor of reducing the Fed’s $85
billion monthly pace of bond purchases as unemployment declines.
However, officials including St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said last month that persistent disinflation may require
the Fed to provide additional stimulus. Fed policy makers, who
have kept the benchmark  interest rate  close to zero since 2008,
next meet on June 18-19.  Officials have to be aware of the impact of a zero
interest-rate policy and “mindful of unintended consequences,”
Plosser said. “The question is that as the drag from the labor
market begins to wane, will the impact of the extra liquidity
take off? If we wait too long, will we be behind the curve?”  Plosser added that central banks shouldn’t react to markets
when determining their policies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
