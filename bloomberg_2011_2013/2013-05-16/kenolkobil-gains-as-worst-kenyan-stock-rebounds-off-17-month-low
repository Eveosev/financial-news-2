KenolKobil Ltd.,  Kenya ’s  worst-performing  stock, gained the most in more than eight months on
speculation a 20 percent decline in  East Africa ’s largest fuel
retailer this year is overdone.  The shares  rallied  9.1 percent, the biggest one-day advance
since Sept. 12, to 10.8 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the
capital, Nairobi. About 5.1 million shares traded, 3.8 times the
three-month daily average. KenolKobil has jumped 19 percent
since falling to 9.05 shillings on April 25, the lowest since
December 2011. On that day, the company’s  relative strength
index  dropped to 29, below the 30 level that signals to
technical analysts a security is oversold.  Investors “are coming in now because the price had fallen
too low,” Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan
Capital Ltd., said by phone.  KenolKobil, which has operations in nine African countries,
in March said it terminated talks on Puma Energy BV’s planned
acquisition of a controlling stake in the company. KenolKobil
began negotiations with Puma, the Geneva-based downstream and
storage unit of Trafigura Beheer BV, last May. A month later,
KenolKobil reported a full-year loss of 6.28 billion shillings
($75 million) from a profit of 3.27 billion shillings a year
earlier.  The worst of the news from the company is over and the
“outlook is good,” Mwanyasi said. Last year’s loss was mainly
due to foreign exchange losses, which won’t be repeated this
year, he said.  The Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share Index has gained
35 percent this year, the world’s third-best performer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
