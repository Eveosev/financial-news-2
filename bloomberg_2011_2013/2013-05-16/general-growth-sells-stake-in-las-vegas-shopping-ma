General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP)  sold
half its interest in the Grand Canal Shoppes, including the
Shoppes at the Palazzo, in Las Vegas for net proceeds of $410
million as part of a new joint venture with TIAA-CREF.  The 774,000-square-foot (72,000-square-meter) mall in the
Venetian and the Palazzo hotel-and-casino complex on the Las
Vegas Strip is 99 percent leased, the partners said today in a
statement. General Growth, based in Chicago, said it will
continue to handle management and leasing of the property, which
generates more than $1,000 of sales per square foot.  The investment boosts New York-based TIAA-CREF’s real
estate holdings as demand for luxury-mall space climbs. At
regional centers, which typically include department stores,
vacancies fell to 8.3 percent in the first quarter from 9
percent a year earlier, and rents rose to $39.46 a square foot
from $39, research firm  Reis Inc. (REIS)  said on April 4.  Tenants at Grand Canal include Sephora, Swarovski, Banana
Republic,  Kenneth Cole , Godiva Chocolatier and the Art of
Shaving, according to General Growth’s  website .  TIAA-CREF, the provider of retirement accounts for teachers
and non-profit organizations, had $520 billion of assets under
management as of the end of March, according to the statement.
