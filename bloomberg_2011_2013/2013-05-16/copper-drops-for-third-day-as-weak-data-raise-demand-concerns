Copper declined for a third day in
 London  on concerns that demand from China, the U.S. and  Germany ,
the largest users, is weakening.  Metal for delivery in three months dropped as much as 0.6
percent to $7,155 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and
was at $7,193.25 at 10:21 a.m. in Shanghai. Copper for September
delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.4 percent to
51,770  yuan  ($8,419) a ton, and the July contract on the Comex
in New York lost 0.4 percent to $3.2525 per pound.  U.S. industrial production declined in April by the most in
eight months, exceeding the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey. Yesterday’s data also showed Germany expanded less than
forecast in the first quarter. China’s economy has downward
pressure, Lian Weiliang, vice chairman of the National
Development and Reform Commission said.  “China’s growth and demand is weak,” Xu Liping, an
analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co., said by phone from  Shanghai .
“The weak data together drove copper back and it’s now on its
way to test support at $7,000.”  On the LME, aluminum and zinc gained, while tin fell.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
