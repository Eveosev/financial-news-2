Premier Oil Plc (PMO) , an energy explorer
operating from the U.K. to  Southeast Asia , is targeting as much
as 3 billion barrels of oil resources after acquiring
exploration blocks in Brazil for the first time.  The company and its partners won 5-year exploration
licenses for three blocks off northeast Brazil, Premier said
today in a statement. It will invest about $150 million in
seismic studies and exploration wells as well as a signature
bonus.  “It’s a new country for Premier,” said Andrew Lodge,
exploration director at the London-based company. “We are
trying to replenish our portfolio and bring more impact to it.”  Premier is reversing a series of unsuccessful exploration
wells in 2012, having reported four new oil and gas discoveries
this year, including the largest find, Luno II in  Norway . The
company expects to pump as much as 70,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day in 2013 after ramping up production at the
Huntington oilfield in the  North Sea .  QGOG Constellation SA and  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  are
Premier’s partners in  Block 90 in the Foz do Amazonas Basin,
while International Petroleum Investment Co’s Cia. Espanola de
Petroleos SA is the partner in the Blocks 665 and 717 in the
Ceara Basin. Each block may contain 250 million barrels to 1
billion barrels of oil.  Premier expects to produce as much as 60,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day in the first half of the year, it said today in
a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
