Central banks that use extraordinary
stimulus measures to boost economic growth will have to manage
the risks that emerge when those policies are scaled back,
according to a  Bank of Canada  research paper.  While asset purchases and commitments to keep interest
rates low have succeeded in warding off deflation and
encouraging growth, misjudging the pace of stimulus removal
could trigger inflation or undermine recoveries, according to a
paper in the Ottawa-based central bank’s Review today.  “Clear communication and guidance will be crucial for a
successful exit,” according to the paper by researchers Eric
Santor and Lena Suchanek. “While central banks must be mindful
of the potential costs and risks of their actions, currently
these issues do not appear to present sufficient cause to
restrict the use of these measures.”  Central banks in the U.S.,  Japan  and  Europe  are buying
assets after cutting  interest rates  to record lows didn’t
sustain economic growth. U.S. Federal Reserve officials are now
debating whether to wind down or increase their $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases.  The exit risks from asset purchases include the losses
central banks may incur on their increased bond holdings and a
perceived erosion of independence from governments, according to
the paper.  A prolonged period of low interest rates can also
contribute to instability if investors take on too much risk as
they seek higher returns, the authors said, while easy monetary
policy can create international political tension if nations are
seen to be unfairly weakening their currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
