Bahrain must urgently cut spending or
risk unsustainable public debt as its fiscal deficit widens and
oil prices decline, according to the  International Monetary
Fund .  The smallest Gulf crude producer needs “gradual fiscal
consolidation” equal to 7.7 percent of economic output over the
next six budget years to contain its government debt at 40
percent of gross domestic product, the Washington-based fund
said in report released late yesterday. It also recommended that
Bahrain pare its fiscal stimulus to 0.9 percentage points of
non-oil GDP from 2.1 percentage points, it said.  “There is now an urgent need to initiate a medium-term
fiscal strategy with a view to adopt a gradual retargeting of
subsidies, contain public-sector wage increases, increase non-oil revenues, rationalize  capital expenditures , and place the
pension fund on a sustainable path,” the report said. It did
not give a 2013 budget deficit forecast and projected public
debt could grow to 61 percent of GDP by 2018 without a stricter
fiscal program.  Bahrain’s outstanding debt including interest is about
$11.8 billion, with more than $3 billion due this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The cost of insuring
its debt against default has risen  15 basis points  so far this
year to 205 basis points on May 15, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Its nominal GDP at the end of 2012 was $27.1
billion, according to preliminary data in the IMF report.  Bahrain’s economic growth slowed in 2011 after the
government declared a state of emergency and relied on military
support from neighboring countries to quell protests during the
Arab Spring rebellions. Non-oil activity rebounded last year on
 government spending , and Bahrain’s current account remained
“strong” at an estimated 18.2 percent of GDP, the IMF report
said.  The nation’s economy may expand 4.2 percent in 2013, the
IMF said in its World Economic Outlook in April, two percentage
points less than the government forecast.  Standard & Poor’s 
cited improvements in the “political, economic and fiscal
situation” when it revised the kingdom’s credit outlook to
stable from negative in January. Bahrain also managed a better-than-expected budget deficit of 2.6 percent in 2012, the fund
said.  Still, investment in Bahrain’s private sector remains low,
which may translate to non-oil growth of less than 4 percent in
2013, the fund said in its report yesterday. Bahrain is also
vulnerable to oil price fluctuations, especially after its
fiscal break-even price reached $115 in 2012, according to the
IMF.  Crude oil has declined 2.2 percent so far this week to
$93.91 a barrel at 10:08 a.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
