The European Union could contain
energy costs by calling for action from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, former U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said today.  “What they can do is band together as consumer countries
and jawbone OPEC, which they’ve always been reluctant to do,”
Richardson, a consultant for the Washington-based Apco Worldwide
Inc., said in an interview in Brussels today.  The EU also can reshape its energy climate by turning to
tax breaks instead of subsidies to spur renewable energy
development, Richardson said. Such a shift could play a role in
U.S.-EU trade talks on a possible free-trade agreement, he said.  European Union leaders next week will call for a study of
energy prices and costs facing households and energy-intensive
industries, according to draft conclusions of their May 22
summit. The draft says the European Commission will present
their analysis of energy-price “composition and drivers”
before the end of 2013 for talks in February 2014.  Richardson said U.S.-EU trade talks may gain a boost now
that President  Barack Obama  has nominated  Michael Froman , deputy
national security adviser for international economics, for the
post of U.S. Trade Representative.  “He’s the best possible point man the president could have
chosen,” Richardson said. He said Froman “has the ear of the
president,” giving him clout to negotiate with lawmakers and
make deals on the White House’s behalf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
