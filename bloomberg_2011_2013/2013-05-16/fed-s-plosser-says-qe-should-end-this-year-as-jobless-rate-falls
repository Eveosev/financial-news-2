President  Charles Plosser  said his forecast for a falling
unemployment rate would warrant ending the central bank’s bond
purchases this year.  “Unless we see a significant reversal in current trends
that jeopardizes my forecast of near 7 percent unemployment rate
by the end of this year, then I anticipate that we could end the
program before year-end,” Plosser said today in a speech in
Milan.  His prepared remarks on the economy and monetary policy to
the Global Interdependence Center’s Central Banking Series were
identical to a May 14 speech in  Stockholm .  Central bank officials are debating whether to wind down or
increase their $85 billion in monthly bond purchases. Consumer
prices rose 1 percent in March from a year earlier, the lowest
level since October 2009, according to the Fed’s preferred gauge
of inflation.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said on May 1 it will
keep buying bonds at the current level and would be prepared to
increase or reduce the pace in response to changes in the
outlook for inflation and the labor market.  Plosser reiterated that he believes the Fed should begin to
curtail its purchases as early as its next gathering, scheduled
for June 18-19.  -- Editors: Mark Rohner, Kevin Costelloe  To contact the reporters on this story:
