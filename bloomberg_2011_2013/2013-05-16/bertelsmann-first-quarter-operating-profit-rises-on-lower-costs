Bertelsmann SE,  Europe ’s biggest
media company, said first-quarter operating profit grew as the
company trimmed costs and took full control of its BMG music-rights business.  Operating earnings before interest and taxes from
continuing operations rose 8.6 percent to 303 million euros
($390 million) in the three months ended in March, the
Guetersloh, Germany-based company said in a statement today.
Revenue slipped less than 1 percent to 3.63 billion euros.  Bertelsmann sold shares last month in broadcaster RTL Group
SA for 1.4 billion euros to help finance further acquisitions as
it plans to expand outside of traditional print and television
media channels and become less reliant on Europe. A few weeks
earlier, the Germany company acquired full ownership of BMG
Rights by buying a 51 percent stake from partner KKR & Co.  “In a challenging market environment, our businesses again
expanded their high profitability over the past few months,”
Chief Executive Officer Thomas Rabe said in the statement.  The company’s  Random House  publishing unit agreed in
October to merge with  Pearson Plc (PSON) ’s Penguin division to create
the largest  book publisher  in the U.K. and the U.S. Bertelsmann,
founded in 1835, is controlled by the Mohn family, whose member
Christoph Mohn became chairman of the supervisory board this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
