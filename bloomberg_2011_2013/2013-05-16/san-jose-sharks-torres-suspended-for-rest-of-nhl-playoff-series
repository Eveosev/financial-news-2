The  National Hockey League  suspended
San Jose Sharks forward Raffi Torres for the rest of the Western
Conference semifinal series against the  Los Angeles Kings  for an
illegal hit to the head of the Kings’ Jarret Stoll.  The NHL said in an e-mailed release that Torres, 31, was
treated as a repeat offender. Torres received a 21-game
suspension in the playoffs last year while playing for Phoenix.
That was his third suspension in 13 months.  Stoll was knocked out of the game by Torres’s hit late in
the second period of Game 1 of the series in Los Angeles two
days ago. The defending champion Kings lead the series 1-0, with
Game 2 set for later tonight in  Los Angeles .  Torres and Stoll were teammates on the 2006 Edmonton Oilers
that lost in the Stanley Cup finals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
