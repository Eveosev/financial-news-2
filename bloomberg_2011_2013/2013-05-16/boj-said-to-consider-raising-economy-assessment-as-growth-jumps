The Bank of  Japan  may upgrade its
assessment of the nation’s economy as evidence mounts that
domestic demand is strengthening, according to people familiar
with the central bank’s discussions.  After saying last month that “Japan’s economy has stopped
weakening and has shown some signs of picking up,” the central
bank could alter the wording to underscore progress in the
recovery, according to the people, who asked not to be named as
the BOJ discussions are private.  The next assessment will come after a May 22 monetary
policy meeting. One possibility is dropping the reference to
“stopped weakening.”  Japan’s economy expanded the most in a year last quarter as
consumer spending and export gains outweighed the weakest
business investment since the wake of the March 2011 earthquake,
a government report showed today. Gross domestic product rose an
annualized 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
