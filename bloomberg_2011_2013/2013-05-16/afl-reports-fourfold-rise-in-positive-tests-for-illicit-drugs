The Australian Football League said
players recorded 26 positive tests for illicit drugs in 2012, a
more than fourfold increase from the previous year.  The failed tests were out of competition, with all but one
related to stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine, the
Melbourne-based AFL said in a statement today. The positives
were detected in 1,979 tests in 2012, compared with six from
1,489 tests the previous year.  The names of players who tested positive weren’t released
by the  AFL , which has an Illicit Drugs Policy that’s separate
from regular anti-doping checks carried out during the season.
Players are given counseling by the league after failed tests
and face sanctions after a third positive test.  “The rise in detections in 2012 reflects both an increase
in the number and effectiveness of target tests conducted as
well as the well-documented jump in illicit drug availability
and use in the broader community,” AFL Chief Executive Officer
Andrew Demetriou said in a statement. “The AFL playing group
largely falls within the high risk 18-30 male age group and
individual players are not immune to peer group pressure and
poor decision-making.”  The AFL’s findings follow an Australian Crime Commission
investigation that identified widespread use of prohibited
substances including peptides, hormones and illegal drugs across
multiple sports.  Australia ’s anti-doping agency said Feb. 14 it
needed to interview about 150 people in relation to the probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
