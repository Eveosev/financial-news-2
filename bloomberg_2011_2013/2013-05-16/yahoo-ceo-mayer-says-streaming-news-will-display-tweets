Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  Chief Executive Officer
 Marissa Mayer  plans to start displaying posts from Twitter
Inc.’s microblogging service alongside other items featured in
news feeds.  U.S. users will see Twitter updates on desktop and mobile
versions of Yahoo’s news service in the next few days, Mayer
said on a  blog  posting today.  Mayer, CEO since July, is adding services for mobile users
as she works to revive growth at Yahoo. She’s shuttered some
less popular online services, including a coupon site and local
events calendar, to focus more resources on marquee properties
like mobile applications for e-mail and weather.  “We’re committed to delivering our users the very best of
the Web, and our continued partnership with Twitter is an
exciting leap forward in our endeavors,” Mayer wrote on the
blog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
