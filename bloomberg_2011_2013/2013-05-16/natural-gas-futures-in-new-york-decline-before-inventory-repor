Natural gas futures fell the most in
two weeks in  New York  after a U.S. stockpile increase exceeded
forecasts.  Gas dropped 3.4 percent, the biggest one-day decline since
May 2, after the Energy Information Administration said
inventories rose 99 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 10
to 1.964 trillion. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
showed a gain of 95 billion. Gas prices climbed 4.1 percent the
previous three days on speculation that an unusually warm end to
May would spur demand from  power plants  to run air conditioners.  “We did see a larger-than-expected build in storage for
the second consecutive week,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst
at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “The rally that
preceded this drop was not well-supported fundamentally. We are
seeing year-on-year supply growth, so production growth against
the demand decline, that’s bearish.”  Natural gas for June delivery dropped 13.8 cents to settle
at $3.932 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures trading volume was 6.4 percent
above the 100-day average at 4:25 p.m. Prices are up 17 percent
this year.  June $4.80 calls were the most-active option in electronic
trading. They fell 0.1 cent to 0.1 cent per million Btu on
volume of 5,028 at 4:24 p.m. June $3.75 puts were the next-most
active, gaining 1.1 cents to 2.2 cents on volume of 1,853. Calls
accounted for 58 percent of trading.  Options Volatility  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June was 29.51 percent at 4:15 p.m., down from 32.58 percent
yesterday. Volatility for July options was 30.26 percent,
compared with 30.2 percent yesterday.  The magnitude of the price move down shows “a lot of longs
in the market were caught by surprise,” said Cindy Wexler, an
independent gas trader on the Nymex floor. There is technical
support for  gas prices  at $3.91 and if they don’t hold that
level, the futures may drop to the next support area at $3.883,
she said.  Natural gas has slumped 12 percent since touching a 21-month high of $4.444 per million Btu on May 1 after the peak
heating-demand season, extended by the coldest April since 1997,
drew to a close.  Prices had surged into early spring as a  supply deficit  to
the five-year average hovered near a record low.  Hedge funds  and
other large speculators increased bullish bets on natural gas
prices last month to an all-time high in records dating back to
January 2010, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s May 10 Commitments of Traders report.  Above Average  The stockpile increase last week was larger than the five-year average gain for the week of 83 billion cubic feet,
department data show. A  deficit  to the five-year average
narrowed to 4.1 percent from 5 percent the previous week.
Supplies were 26.1 percent below  year-earlier inventories ,
compared with 28.3 percent in last week’s report.  Commodity Weather Group LLC predicted that above-normal
temperatures in central and eastern states over the next five
days will give way to a cool front from May 21 through May 25.
The heat may return to the central U.S. at the end of the month,
the Bethesda, Maryland-based forecaster said.  “The real change this week is those weather maps turned
decidedly warmer for the balance of May and most importantly we
are seeing that heat begin to move into Texas,” Teri Viswanath,
director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in New York.
 Texas  and the Southeast states account for nearly half of U.S.
summer electric power demand, she said.  The outlook for cooling demand as hot weather moves may
keep prices from cratering, she said.  Contract Spreads  The discount of June to October contracts, a measure of
summer supply expectations, widened 1.1 cents to 8.5 cents. The
discount of October to January contracts widened 1.7 cents to
32.5 cents.  Gas consumption  typically slumps after the peak heating
season and before hot weather drives demand for electricity to
run air conditioners. About 50 percent of U.S. households use
gas for heating, according to the EIA, the statistical arm of
the Energy Department. Power generation accounts for 33 percent
of gas consumption.  The EIA estimates that U.S. marketed production in 2013
will set a record for the sixth straight year as new wells are
brought online at shale deposits such as the Marcellus in the
Northeast and the Bakken in  North Dakota . Output will climb 1
percent to 69.9 billion cubic feet a day, according to the May 7
Short-Term Energy Outlook. Consumption will increase to 70.17
billion cubic feet a day from 69.68 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
