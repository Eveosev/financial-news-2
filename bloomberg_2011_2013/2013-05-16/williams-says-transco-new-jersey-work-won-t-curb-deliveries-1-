Maintenance on the Transco natural-gas pipeline in northern  New Jersey  won’t interrupt customer
deliveries, Christopher Stockton, a Houston-based spokesman for
 Williams Cos. (WMB) , said in an e-mail.  “The work is related to a planned pipeline integrity test
we are performing called a hydrostatic test, which involves
filling the line with water to ensure it has no integrity
issues,” Stockton said. “Gas is routed around the maintenance
area to ensure deliveries remain whole.”  The pipeline operator was venting gas within the East
Rutherford metering and regulating station today to prepare for
the work, Deann Muzikar, a spokeswoman for Public Service
 Enterprise Group Inc. (E) , operator of New Jersey’s largest utility,
said in an e-mail. Transco also notified PSEG of venting in
Livingston, which was producing an odor, Muzikar said.  This controlled release, a standard operating procedure,
began about 7 a.m. local time and ended today, Stockton said.  The Transco system can transport 9.7 billion cubic feet a
day of gas across 10,200 miles (16,400 kilometers) from the Gulf
Coast to the Northeast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
