OAO Russian Grids,  OAO Novolipetsk
Steel (NLMK)  and OAO Mechel dropped as  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  excluded the stocks
from its  Russia  Index.  Russian Grids was removed from the index along with
Novolipetsk’s GDRs and Mechel’s ADRs as part of MSCI’s semi-annual rebalancing, according to a statement after the market
close yesterday. Funds that track the MSCI indexes readjust
their portfolios based on the changes, which take effect June 3.  “Being excluded from MSCI is not positive for these
stocks,” Sergey Fundobny, head of research at Arbat Capital,
said by phone from Moscow. “This is driving their declines
today.”  Russian Grids, formerly known as MRSK Holding, slumped 5.5
percent to 1.285 rubles in Moscow. The amount of shares traded
was 1.4 times above the three-month average. Novolipetsk fell
for the fourth day, losing 3.9 percent to 45.95 rubles, while
its global depositary receipts declined 4.1 percent to $14.58.  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest coking coal producer, dropped 2.2
percent to 113.70 rubles, while its American depositary receipts
retreated 3.4 percent to $3.68 yesterday, the lowest since April
22.  Russian Grids lost 40 percent over the last 12 months,
while NLMK’s GDRs have tumbled 12 percent and Mechel’s ADRs have
retreated 43 percent.  OAO PhosAgro, the largest European phosphate-fertilizer
producer, declined 5 percent to 1,277.40 rubles. The GDRs sank 5
percent to $13.62. VTB Capital and Sberbank Investment Research
expected PhosAgro’s GDRs to be added to MSCI Russia after
PhosAgro’s controlling holders, Andrey Guryev and his family,
sold a 9 percent stake in the fertilizer producer in April to
gain entry to the index.  Gazprom Gains  “Rather surprisingly, PhosAgro was not included” in the
gauge, Sberbank CIB’s analyst Iskander Abdullaev, said in an e-mailed note.  OAO RusHydro, Russia’s biggest renewable energy producer,
retreated 3.3 percent to 52.89 kopeks in Moscow. The GDRs
declined 2.7 percent to $1.635. MSCI cut the stock’s weighting
in the  Russia Index (RDXUSD)  to 0.79 percent, according to the report.  OAO Gazprom, Russia’s biggest company and natural gas
export monopoly, increased 1.9 percent to 124.78 rubles. The
stock’s weighting was lifted to 21.8 percent, according to
MSCI’s note. The GDRs gained 2 percent to $7.925 in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
