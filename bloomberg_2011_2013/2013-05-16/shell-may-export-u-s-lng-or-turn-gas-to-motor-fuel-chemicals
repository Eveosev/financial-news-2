Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  may export U.S.
natural gas in liquid form, convert it into chemicals or build a
gas-to-liquids plant to produce fuel, said the company’s country
chairman for Dubai and the northern emirates.  Shell is considering the possibilities, and “it is too
soon to say which of these options will go ahead or the precise
timings,” Mounir Bouaziz said in an e-mail.  Shell as well as other international  oil companies  such as
Exxon Mobil Corp and  BP Plc (BP/)  seek to profit from US gas reserves,
which rose 70 percent in the 10 years ended 2011 amid a surge in
output from shale. A rise in domestic production contributed to
a 64 percent drop in prices in the past five years.  Shell and Kinder Morgan Inc. announced their intention to
form a company to export liquefied natural gas from a site in
Georgia, joining more than 20 other companies seeking to export
the fuel. A US-based gas-to-liquids plant may convert the fuel
into  jet fuel , diesel and naphtha. Shell built and operates the
world’s biggest GTL plant in Qatar.  Shell is currently exploring for oil and gas in Turkey
through four ventures, including one to explore deep water off
the Black Sea coast, Bouaziz said. The company is also involved
in projects to extract oil from shale rock in Turkey, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
