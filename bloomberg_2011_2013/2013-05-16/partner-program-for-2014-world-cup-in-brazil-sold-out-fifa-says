The partner program for the 2014
World Cup in Brazil has sold out,  Jerome Valcke , general
secretary of soccer governing body FIFA, said.  Latin American sports retailer Centauro was the final
company to join FIFA’s commercial program, Valcke said.  “We have no more space for any commerical company to join
FIFA World Cup 2014,” Valcke told reporters today in Rio de
Janeiro. “FIFA World Cup 2014 is sold out.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
