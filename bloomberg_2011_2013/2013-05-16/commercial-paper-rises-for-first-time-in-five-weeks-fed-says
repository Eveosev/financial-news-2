The market for corporate borrowing
through  commercial paper  expanded for the first time in five
weeks, led by an increase in financial issuance.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
rose $21.1 billion to $1.014 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
Thatâ€™s the biggest advance since a $27.8 billion surge in the
period ended Jan. 16.  Commercial paper sold by  U.S.-based banks  climbed $12.4
billion to $293.5 billion, the first increase since the period
ended April 10, while the amount issued by  non-U.S. financial
institutions  jumped $8.1 billion to $240.8 billion, the highest
level since the period ended Feb. 6, Fed data show.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
