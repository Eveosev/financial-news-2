Elliott Management Corp. took a
significant stake in  NetApp Inc. (NTAP) , pressing the data-storage
company to change its board and study options to boost
shareholder value, people familiar with the situation said.  NetApp shares rose 6.2 percent, the biggest  gain  since Nov.
15. Elliott, the hedge-fund firm founded by billionaire Paul Singer, has been in talks with NetApp for weeks over its
proposals, including a return of cash to shareholders, said one
of the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks
are private. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is working with NetApp to
help the company examine its options, one person said.  Elliott has a stake of less than 5 percent and it has
proposed a slate of new directors for Sunnyvale, California-based NetApp, the person said. NetApp has been viewed as a
takeover target for about a decade, with  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  and  Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO)  cited as potential buyers. While NetApp is
positioned to benefit as businesses store and manage data on the
Web, the company’s technology hasn’t kept up with larger rivals.  “NetApp is under attack from a lot of new technologies and
ideas,” said  Jayson Noland , an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co.
in San Francisco, who has a neutral  rating  on the stock with a
price target of $34.  The stock  advanced  to $38.46 at the close in New York. The
shares earlier rose as high as $39.15, the most since November.  Elliott may also increase its stake, said the person.  Representatives for Elliott, NetApp and Goldman Sachs
declined to comment.  Cash Hoard  NetApp has too much  cash  and can return more to
shareholders, according to Brian Alexander, an analyst at
Raymond James & Associates Inc.  “Even after retiring the $1.2 billion convertible note due
in June, they still have plenty of liquidity,” said Alexander,
who rates the stock outperform with a price target of $40 a
share. “A takeover is less likely because their technology is
not well positioned for where the future in storage will occur,
such as big data and cloud computing.”  By the end of April, NetApp had $7 billion of cash, of
which half is in the U.S., according to an estimate by
Alexander.  Before rising on the news of Elliott’s investment today,
NetApp shares had  declined  33 percent in the past two years
wiping out $6.8 billion in market value, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. During the same period, the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Information Technology Index increased 19 percent.  Falling Value  “They’re not paying a dividend, buying back stock
aggressively or doing strategic M&A,” said Noland. “They need
to pick a path” to return some cash to shareholders, he said.  NetApp’s market capitalization, which peaked at almost $47
billion in 2000 at the height of the dot-com bubble, was $13.1
billion yesterday.  In November, NetApp’s enterprise value  fell  to 5.7 times
its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, a four-year low, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The company’s Ebitda multiple as of yesterday was 8.9 times.  NetApp is releasing its fourth-quarter earnings for the
period ending April 26 on May 21.  Elliott, based in New York, has a history of pressing
technology companies to make deals. The firm lobbied  BMC
Software Inc. (BMC)  last year to consider a sale, a goal realized
earlier this month with the announcement of the company’s $6.9
billion takeover by Bain Capital LLC, Golden Gate Capital and
other firms.  Compuware, Hess  Elliott also has pressed for change at  Compuware Corp. (CPWR) ,
offering to buy the business-software maker for $2.3 billion in
December.  The hedge fund has also made headway in other industries.
 Hess Corp. (HES) , an oil company, said today that it’s ending a four-month proxy fight with Elliott, adding three of five board
nominees put forth by the activist investor.  Elliott’s pressure comes at a time when new technologies
threaten NetApp, which has recently completed an overhaul of its
operating system for its storage computers, called OnTap.  While NetApp has specialized in systems that use disk
drives, the hardware maker has yet to start selling products
based on higher-performance electronic “flash” storage.  Options traders have increased bullish bets on NetApp in
the past two months. The  number  of outstanding calls giving the
right to buy the stock rose 76 percent since March 15 to 348,921
on May 14. That compares with a 62 percent increase to 292,360
in ownership of puts to sell the stock.  “NetApp options activity the last few weeks has positioned
for an upside move in shares,” Joe Kunkle, founder of
OptionsHawk.com, a Boston-based provider of options-market data
and analytics, said in an e-mail. The buying “indicated a large
player was at work in the name,” he said.  Notable trades included 5,000 September $36 calls on April
23, 8,000 bullish contracts with the same expiration at the
beginning of May as well as the accumulation of various June
call options at strikes as far out as $40, according to Kunkle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
