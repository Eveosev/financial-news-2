Silver prices on average will fall in
2013 as supplies increase and investor demand ebbs, marking the
second straight drop in a projected “multiyear” decline, CPM
Group said.  The metal will average $25.85 an ounce, Jeffrey Christian,
the managing director of New York-based CPM, said in an
interview before the release today of the research company’s
silver yearbook. That’s down 17 percent from $31.187 in 2012,
the Comex futures average, partly because of a decline in use by
the photography, jewelry and solar-panel industries. Last year,
the price dropped 12 percent from 2011.  This year, silver has tumbled 25 percent, the most among 24
 raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index. The
commodity entered a  bear market  on April 1 as slowing economies
spurred concern that industrial demand will ebb. Holdings in
exchange-traded funds backed by the metal have dropped 1.5
percent to 19,441 metric tons from a record on March 18,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg  “Rather than buying the metal in a rising price
environment with strong expectations for higher prices,
investors now are commanding price dips,” CPM said in a
statement. The price drop reflects “this new price-sensitive
posture among investors combined with a reduction in fabrication
demand,” the company said.  Refined silver supplies rose 1.5 percent to a record 981.6
million ounces in 2012, CPM said.  Mine supply increased, driven by expansion in  Mexico ,
China,  Peru  and  Australia , CPM said.  Fabrication demand fell 1.8 percent to 858.9 million ounces
because of Europe’s recession and a drop in usage in  India , CPM
said.  Trading in silver futures and options on major exchanges,
the London spot market and newly refined supplies fell 23
percent to 140.8 billion ounces from a record in 2011, CPM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
