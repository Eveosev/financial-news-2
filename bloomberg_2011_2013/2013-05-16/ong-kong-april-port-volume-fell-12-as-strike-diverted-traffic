Hong Kong container throughput fell
12 percent in April from a year earlier as a 40-day strike at
billionaire  Li Ka-shing ’s port operations diverted traffic and
slowed business at Hongkong International Terminals Ltd.  The facility handled 1.734 million TEUs in last month,
compared with 1.976 million TEUs in the same period last year,
according to data from the Port Development Council. Throughput
at the world’s third-largest container port declined 7.8 percent
from the previous month as workers walked out on March 28,
demanding higher wages.  The disruption forced shipping lines to divert vessels to
nearby ports, including neighboring Shenzhen, southern  China .
The strike by about 450 dock workers, crane operators and
stevedores was the biggest labor revolt against Asia’s richest
man.  Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT) , a unit of Li’s  Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. (13) , dominates half of Hong Kong’s port capacity along
with partner  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199)   The April monthly volume is the  lowest  since November 2009,
excluding February traffic, which is traditionally slower
because of the Chinese New Year holiday. The Hong Kong economy
contracted 2.5 percent for that year. Shenzhen’s container
terminal throughput for April was 1.85 million TEUs, a drop of
0.5 percent on year, according to the Shenzhen Ports
Association.  Hutchison Port was unchanged at 82 cents as of 1:40 p.m. in
Singapore trading today. The stock has gained 3.8 percent this
year,  trailing  the 8.6 percent climb of the Straits Times Index.  Striking workers last week accepted a 9.8 percent wage
increase to end the dispute. Hongkong International operated
about 90 percent of its normal capacity during the strike,
according to a filing by parent Hutchison Port. The labor action
may have cost the company HK$100 million ($13 million),
according to Citigroup Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
