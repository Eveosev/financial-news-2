Canada’s  Supreme Court  dismissed  Eli
Lilly & Co. (LLY) ’s request to appeal a federal court decision that
invalidated its Canadian patent for schizophrenia drug Zyprexa.  The country’s highest court said in a  statement  today it
decided not to look at the case after hearing from parties
involved in the matter earlier this week. A Federal Court in
2011 ruled the patent was invalid because it did not meet
“utility” requirements.  The Indianapolis-based firm has claimed recent decisions by
Canadian courts invalidating 17 drug patents over “utility”
requirements have made the country an outlier among major
developed countries, prompting the company in December to notify
Canada of its plans to file a trade complaint over its patent
for its Strattera drug.  “Addressing Canada’s outlier status with respect to the
interpretation of  patent law  is a priority for Lilly,” the
company said in a statement today. “We will continue to
consider all our legal options to protect what we believe to be
valid intellectual property rights protecting our patents in
Canada.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
