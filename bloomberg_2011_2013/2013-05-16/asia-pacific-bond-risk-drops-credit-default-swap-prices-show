The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
declined, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 2 basis points to
100 basis points as of 10:10 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The measure, which has
ranged from 96.1 basis points to 127.5 this year, is headed for
its lowest close since May 10, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index decreased 0.5 of a basis
point to 76.5 as of 10:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The gauge, which has ranged from 74.3 to 148.1 basis
points since Dec. 31, is set for its first decline in three
days, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 101.5 basis point
as of 8:51 a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.
The benchmark is on course for its first decline in four days,
after closing at its highest since May 3 yesterday, CMA data
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
