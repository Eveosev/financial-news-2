U.K. billionaire  Richard Branson ’s
Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. posted a full-year loss of 69.9
million pounds ($107 million), hurt by higher costs, sluggish
economies and a dip in business travel during the  Olympic Games .  The main airline division had a loss of 93 million pounds,
which was partially offset by a one-time gain of 35.4 million
pounds and a 23.1 million-pound contribution from other units.  Virgin, which aims to boost earnings via a trans-Atlantic
alliance with new shareholder  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) , reiterated
plans for a return to profit by spring 2015. The passenger total
increased by 188,000 to 5.5 million in the 12 months ended Feb.
28 and the company is targeting savings of 45 million pounds
this fiscal year, mainly from computer and e-commerce functions.  “Last year saw a double dip recession, a continued weak
macro economy, and an Olympic Games which, although a fantastic
event, severely dented demand for business travel,” said Chief
Executive Officer Craig Kreeger, who took over on Feb. 1.  Revenue at the Crawley, England-based company, which
competes with  British Airways (IAG)  at  London ’s Heathrow airport,
increased 5 percent to 2.87 billion pounds and the  load factor ,
a measure of seat occupancy, gained 1.3 points to 79 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
