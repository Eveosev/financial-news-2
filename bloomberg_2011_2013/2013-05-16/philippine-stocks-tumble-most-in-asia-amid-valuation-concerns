Philippine stocks tumbled from a
record after valuations reached a nine-year high and a technical
indicator suggested the rally may reverse.  The benchmark  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  slid 1.5
percent to 7,283.36 at 11:11 a.m. in Manila, heading for the
biggest loss in three weeks and the largest decline among Asian
benchmark indexes.  Ayala Land  Inc. and Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co. contributed most to the gauge’s drop.  Philippine stocks have surged 25 percent this year as the
country won its first investment-grade credit ratings from  Fitch
Ratings  and Standard & Poor’s, spurred by President  Benigno
Aquino ’s crackdown on corruption, pursuit of tax cheats and
cutting of the budget deficit. The gauge  trades  at 22 times
reported earnings, the highest since January 2004, according to
monthly data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Philippine market has been expensive for quite some
time,”  Jomar Lacson , an analyst at brokerage Campos Lanuza &
Co., said by phone from Manila. “The earnings season is over
and investors have discounted all their expectations.”  The gauge’s 14-day  relative strength index , a measure of
trading momentum, was 75 yesterday, above the 70 threshold that
signals to some traders that a rally may reverse.  Ayala Land lost 1.9 percent to 34.05 pesos, paring its
advance this year to 29 percent. PLDT dropped 1.5 percent to
3,200 pesos, snapping a 5.7 percent, six-day advance.  San Miguel Corp. slumped 5.3 percent to 116.5 pesos after
the stock was deleted from the MSCI Philippines Index, while
Metro Pacific Investments Corp. gained 1.5 percent to 6.07 pesos
after it was added to the MSCI gauge, effective May 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
