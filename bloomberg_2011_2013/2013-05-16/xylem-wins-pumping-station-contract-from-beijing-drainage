Xylem Inc. (XYL) , the water company whose
pumps helped clean tunnels flooded by  Hurricane Sandy , has been
awarded a contract from Beijing Drainage Group, a state-owned
wastewater utility.  Xylem will install 19 pumping stations in downtown Beijing
as part of the $2.9 million contract, according to a statement
from the White Plains, New York-based company. The pumps will
improve water storage capability and prevent overflows by
providing more efficient drainage and flood control, according
to yesterdayâ€™s statement from the former ITT Corp. unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
