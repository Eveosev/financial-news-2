U.K. government bonds rose, with 10-year yields dropping the most in six weeks, after demand
increased at a 2.5 billion pound ($3.83 billion) auction of 30-year securities.  Benchmark gilts  snapped a two-day decline after U.S.
reports showed consumer prices dropped for a second month in
April and claims for jobless benefits increased, enhancing
demand for fixed-income assets. Investors bid for twice the
amount of 30-year securities the U.K. Treasury sold today, up
from 1.69 times at the previous auction in April. The pound
strengthened for a second day against the dollar.  “It’s a pretty strong result to get two times cover,”
said Sam Hill, a gilts strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
London, referring to the 30-year bond auction. “That has helped
to support the long-end. The fact there is no conventional
supply for the next three weeks means gilts might do well on a
relative basis.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.86 percent at 4:34 p.m.  London  time after
dropping as much as seven basis points, the biggest decline
since April 4. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 rose
0.54, or 5.40 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 99.07.  The 30-year  yield  slid five basis points to 3.17 percent
after rising to 3.23 percent yesterday, the highest level since
March 20.  Bond Sale  The U.K. government sold 3.25 percent bonds maturing in
January 2044 at an average yield of 3.293 percent, compared with
3.121 percent at the previous auction of the securities on April
18 and a record-low for a 30-year maturity of 2.951 percent on
Sept. 5.  U.S. consumer prices fell 0.4 percent last month, the
biggest decline since December 2008, the Labor Department said
in  Washington . Jobless claims jumped by 32,000 to 360,000 in the
week ended May 11, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists, a separate report showed.  RBC recommends betting 10-year gilts will outperform
similar-maturity German bunds, Hill said.  The extra yield, or  spread , investors receive for holding
10-year gilts instead of bunds was 53 basis points today, having
widened from 45 basis points a month ago.  U.K. gilts have returned 2.4 percent in year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds rose 1.8 percent and Treasuries gained 0.8 percent.  The pound strengthened 0.5 percent to $1.53 after falling
to $1.5174 yesterday, the lowest since April 4. The U.K.
currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 84.26 pence per euro.  Sterling has weakened 4 percent in the past 12 months, the
second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 0.3 percent and the euro advanced 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
