Champion Real Estate Investment Trust (2778) 
will buy  office space  in Citibank Plaza from  Hong Kong ’s
government for HK$2.16 billion ($278 million), consolidating its
ownership of the city-center office complex.  The company will buy 78,316 square feet of floor area, of
which 54,896 square feet is rentable, from the Financial
Secretary Inc., a government body, according to a Hong Kong
stock exchange filing yesterday. Champion said it’s paying an 11
percent premium to the appraised value of HK$1.95 billion.  The purchase means that Hong Kong-based Champion now owns
100 percent of Citibank Plaza, which is comprised of the 47-story Citibank Tower and the 37-story ICBC Tower. The government
bought the space from the company for HK$820 million in 1996 for
use as offices for the city’s  Legislative Council , which has
since moved to new and larger premises.  “The REIT manager believes that owning the entire Citibank
Plaza will provide Champion REIT with greater operational
control of the Grade A office building, for example, the ability
to unilaterally implement improvement and refurbishment works
which would enhance the rental value,” the trust said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
