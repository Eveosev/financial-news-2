PPC Ltd. (PPC) , South Africa’s biggest
cement maker, said U.S. dollar-based operations outside its home
market boosted revenue for the six months through March.  All of the company’s foreign operations are conducted in
dollars, PPC’s Chief Executive Officer Ketso Gordhan said in a
phone interview from Johannesburg today. “We have had a 15
percent increase in  Zimbabwe ,” in sales in the period, because
of currency shifts and higher volume he said.  Six-month sales rose 8 percent to 3.8 billion rand ($409.6
million), compared with a year earlier, the company said in a
statement. PPC, which also operates in Botswana and Ethiopia,
plans on building a 1 million metric-ton capacity plant in
 Democratic Republic  of the Congo, Gordhan said.  PPC shares declined 1.6 percent to 34.20 rand at 10:33 a.m.
in Johannesburg.  The rand weakened about 10 percent against the dollar at
the end of March from September, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency of Africa’s biggest economy is the
second-worst performing against the dollar this year, declining
8.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
