European  corporates  are likely to
hoard cash and reduce debt in coming years, holding back
economic growth as they seek to preserve financial flexibility,
according to Standard & Poor’s.  Non-financial companies in the region will probably need
$10 trillion to $10.4 trillion of funding through 2017, the New
York-based ratings firm said in a report today, cutting an
earlier estimate that put the requirement at as much as $10.9
trillion. That will reduce Europe’s share of global debt to 20
percent from 24 percent at end-2012, while  China ’s share is
likely to be about 30 percent by end-2017, according to the
report.  Declining demand for funding has implications for the bond
market as European companies shift their sources of financing to
capital markets and away from banks. At the same time, the
European Commission’s Europe 2020 infrastructure investment
program may need as much as $2.6 trillion, drawing on the same
pool of capital companies need to access, S&P said.  “The high proportion of bank lending in Europe is a
concern from our perspective,” S&P said in the report. The firm
cited smaller companies’ ability to find funding, the need to
refinance about $8.4 trillion of corporate debt over the next
five years, and the funding of the Europe 2020 investments,
which need to be made to support growth, as reasons for its
disquiet.  At the end of last year, 85.8 percent of corporate debt in
Europe came from banks, a 4 percent decline from 2008, S&P said,
citing Eurostat figures. That compares with the 51.4 percent of
the total that banks in the U.S. provide, according to the
Federal Reserve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
