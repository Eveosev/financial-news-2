five years,” Torbjoern Kjus, a senior oil analyst at DNB ASA in

muted growth,” said David Lennox, a resource analyst at Fat

pressure on crude prices. The EIA numbers, especially diesel,
have shown for the last couple of weeks a weakening trend.”  Housing Starts  U.S.  gasoline consumption  shrank 1.2 percent last week to
