German  government bonds  rose, with
10-year yields dropping the most in seven weeks, as reports
showed U.S. jobless claims increased and euro-area inflation
slowed, boosting the prospects of more central-bank stimulus.  Germany ’s two-year yields dropped  below zero  for the first
time in a week, while French, Dutch and Austrian securities also
advanced. Spanish and Italian bonds rose after the two nations
sold 13 billion euros ($16.8 billion) of debt via banks over the
past two days, signaling demand for their securities remains
intact. The  European Central Bank  cut its main  interest rate  to
a  record low  on May 2 to support the economy.  “The weakness of the euro economy means the ECB is keeping
the door open for potential rate cuts down the line,” said  Nick
Stamenkovic , a strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in
Edinburgh. “Unless we see signs of an improvement in the
economy, I don’t really see bunds coming out of this range”
between 1.20 percent and 1.40 percent, he said.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield dropped five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.33 percent at 5 p.m.  London  time,
after falling as much as six basis points, the most since March
27. The 1.5 percent security maturing in February 2023 rose
0.47, or 4.70 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.535.  The two-year note yield fell three basis points to minus
0.007 percent, the first time it has dropped below zero since
May 9. A negative yield mean investors who hold the debt until
maturity will receive less than what they paid for it.  Inflation Slows  A Labor Department report showed U.S. jobless claims
climbed in the week ended May 11 to the most since March, while
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
 index  unexpectedly fell in May for the first time in three
months. The U.S. consumer-price index dropped 0.4 percent, the
biggest decrease since December 2008, after falling 0.2 percent
in March, another government report showed in  Washington .  The European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said
the annual  inflation rate  in the common-currency bloc dropped to
1.2 percent last month from 1.7 percent in March. That’s the
lowest since February 2010 and matched an earlier estimate.  Spain ’s 10-year yield fell three basis points to 4.31
percent, dropping as much as nine basis points, the most since
May 3. The rate climbed to 4.41 percent yesterday, the highest
since April 25.  Italy ’s 10-year yield declined three basis
points to 3.98 percent.  ‘Good Progress’  “This week has seen euro periphery continue to make good
progress with their respective funding programs,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “This limits sovereign tail risk in
the coming months.”  Spain sold 7 billion euros of a new benchmark 10-year bond
through banks on May 14. The syndication attracted bids
exceeding 21 billion euros, according to a person with knowledge
of the deal who asked not to be identified because they’re not
authorized to speak about it. Italy yesterday sold 6 billion
euros of 30-year bonds via banks.  France ’s five-year notes rose as the nation sold 3.65
billion euros of the securities with borrowing costs close to a
record low.  France allotted 1 percent notes due in May 2018 at 0.74
percent, compared with a  record-low  auction yield of 0.73
percent on April 18. The nation also sold debt due in 2015 and
2017, as well as 1.2 billion euros of inflation-linked bonds.  The French five-year note yield slipped five basis points
to 0.72 percent.  Volatility on Belgium’s bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of France and Finland, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Germany’s bonds returned 1.8 percent over the past year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Spain’s securities gained 18 percent and Italy’s earned 17
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
