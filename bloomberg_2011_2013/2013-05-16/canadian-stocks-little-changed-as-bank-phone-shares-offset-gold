Canadian stocks  were little changed
as a rally in phone and bank shares offset a slump in gold
prices that dragged mining stocks lower.  Telus Corp. rallied 0.9 percent after  Canada ’s third-largest wireless operator agreed to buy the struggling mobile-phone provider Mobilicity for C$380 million ($373 million).
Royal Bank of Canada and Manulife Financial Corp. climbed more
than 0.3 percent. Barrick Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc., the two
largest producers of the precious metal, sank at least 2.2
percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 16.10
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,489.75 at 10:00 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark gauge for Canadian equities has fallen 0.8 percent
this week.  Gold slid for a sixth day, dropping to the lowest in almost
a month in New York, as filings showed that  George Soros  and
BlackRock Inc. cut holdings of bullion-backed exchange-traded
products. Prices for silver and copper also fell.  U.S. economic data showed starts of new homes fell to a
five-month low, jobless claims jumped to a six-week high and the
cost of living fell in April for a second month, the first back-to-back declines inflation since late 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
