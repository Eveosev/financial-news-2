(Corrects previous low for demand in headline and first
paragraph.)  Gold demand dropped 13 percent to the
lowest in three years in the first quarter as record exchange-traded product sales by investors outweighed a surge in buying
from China and India, the  World Gold Council  said.  Global demand fell to 963 metric tons in the quarter, from
1,107.5 tons a year earlier, the London-based industry group
said today in a report. Record jewelry demand in China helped
push the country’s total consumption above India, last year’s
top buyer. Retail investment and jewelry demand in both nations
jumped a combined 23 percent in the quarter. While central-bank
purchases fell 5.2 percent, they totaled more than 100 tons for
the seventh straight quarter.  Prices that rallied as much as sevenfold in the past 12
years entered a  bear market  last month as inflation failed to
accelerate and as equities climbed on mounting optimism that the
U.S. will lead a global economic recovery. Some investors’ loss
of faith in gold as a protection of wealth is being reflected in
ETP holdings that have declined every month this year. About 75
percent of the ETP sales were from U.S. products, the council
estimates. The price slump boosted demand for coins and jewelry.  “There is clearly among some investors in the U.S. a sense
that the economic recovery in North America is becoming more
sustainable and therefore they are to some degree moving back
into risk assets,” Marcus Grubb, managing director of
investment research at the council, said yesterday by phone from
London. “In the first quarter, you were starting to see a
physical demand response, especially in  Asia . Since April you’ve
seen huge increases in physical demand around the world.”  Gold Price  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,407.76 an ounce in
London yesterday, down 16 percent this year. It reached a two-year low of $1,321.95 on April 16. Prices averaged $1,631.90 in
the first quarter, down 3.5 percent from a year earlier and 5
percent lower than the fourth quarter. Last quarter’s demand was
the least since usage of 958 tons in the first quarter of 2010,
the council said.  Investors sold a record 182.1 tons of gold through ETPs in
the three months through March, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Assets have since dropped another 230.1 tons, falling to 2,219.7
tons by May 14, the lowest since July 2011. Holdings are down 16
percent this year after increasing every year since the first
product was listed in 2003.  Global jewelry demand rose 12 percent to 551 tons in the
latest quarter, as purchases jumped 19 percent to 184.8 tons in
 China  and climbed 15 percent to 159.5 tons in India, the report
showed. U.S. jewelry consumption was up 6.2 percent, the first
quarterly increase since 2005, Grubb said.  Asian Demand  Total consumer demand in China jumped 20 percent to 294.3
tons, beating Indian consumption that climbed 27 percent to
256.5 tons, the council said. Bar and coin investment advanced
22 percent to 109.5 tons in China and rose 52 percent to 97 tons
in India. While the council previously said China will probably
overtake India as the biggest buyer on an annual basis, it
expects Indian demand may reach about 965 tons this year,
remaining above Chinese consumption of about 880 tons.  “You may see a situation in the future where these two
markets change places with each other on quite a regular
basis,” said Grubb. “Before, it did look as if China was going
to accelerate through  India  quite quickly and become the larger
market for a sustainable period. I think that’s now much less
clear. The good thing is you’ve got two big markets now.”  Global coin sales were up 19 percent from a year earlier
and bar demand rose 8.1 percent. Over-the-counter and stock flow
demand, partly a statistical residual, was at 119.6 tons,
compared with sales of 75 tons a year earlier, the council said.
That left total investment little changed at 320.4 tons.  Gold Investment  “There’s a dichotomy here between what’s happened in the
ETFs, which is mainly U.S. based, and what’s happened in OTC
investment, which is more outside the U.S.,” said Grubb. The
OTC estimate “suggests that some investors in other geographies
were buying gold and they were doing it through allocated and
unallocated bullion accounts. My hunch is that a lot of that
increase in demand will have been outside  North America .”  Central banks added 109.2 tons to reserves in the three
months through March, a ninth successive quarter of net buying,
the council said. Nations from  Brazil  to  Russia  added 534.6 tons
to reserves last year, 17 percent more than in 2011 and the most
since 1964, it estimates. Buying may be between 450 and 550 tons
this year, Grubb said.  Mine output increased 3.8 percent to 688 tons in the first
quarter, the council said. Scrap supply was down 4.2 percent at
366.6 tons in the quarter, according to the report.  “There’s a belief that prices are too low to attract
recycling,” Grubb said. “A lot of near-market sources of scrap
have been recycled in the last few years. You need a significant
increase in the gold price to stimulate more recycling.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
