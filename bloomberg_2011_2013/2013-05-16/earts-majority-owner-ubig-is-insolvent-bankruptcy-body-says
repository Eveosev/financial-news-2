Ukio Banko Investicine Grupe, or
UBIG, the Lithuanian  investment company  that controls Scottish
soccer club  Heart of Midlothian , is insolvent, said the Baltic
nation’s Department of Enterprise Bankruptcy Management today on
its  website .  The department, part of the  Economy Ministry , said that
Kaunas-based UBIG, at its own request, had been placed on a  list 
of companies unable or unwilling to meet their obligations.  UBIG is a sister company of Ukio Bankas AB, a lender that
Lithuania’s central bank closed in February for risky lending to
related parties. Russian-born investor Vladimir Romanov
controlled both companies.  UBIG owns 79 percent of Edinburgh-based Hearts as well as
sport, aluminum and real-estate projects in several countries,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
