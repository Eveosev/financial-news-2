The dollar erased losses versus the
yen and euro after Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
President  John Williams  said the central bank may begin tapering
as early as this summer the pace of its bond purchases.  The greenback fell earlier from an almost four-year high
versus the yen after weaker-than-forecast reports on U.S.
unemployment claims, housing and inflation damped bets the Fed
will slow its bond buying under the quantitative-easing stimulus
strategy.  South Africa ’s rand slid to the weakest since 2009 on
concern the nation’s economic growth will falter.  “He’s hinted at possibility of tapering QE already,”
 Vassili Serebriakov , a foreign-exchange strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in New York, said of Williams in a telephone
interview. “But I think it still adds fuel to the fire. Markets
have been focusing on tapering, and this remark will certainly
be noted.”  The dollar was little changed at 102.22 yen at 4:16 p.m. in
 New York  after falling as much as 0.4 percent earlier. It
touched 102.76 yen yesterday, the strongest level since October
2008. The U.S. currency traded at $1.2884 per euro after
weakening 0.3 percent earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
