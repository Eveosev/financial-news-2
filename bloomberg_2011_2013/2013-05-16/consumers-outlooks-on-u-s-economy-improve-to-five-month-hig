Consumers’ economic outlook improved
in May to its best reading in five months, showing Americans are
looking beyond the current slowdown to a rebound in growth later
this year.  The monthly Bloomberg consumer economic expectations  gauge 
rose to minus 1 from minus 4 in April, a report today showed.
The weekly Consumer Comfort Index slipped to minus 30.2 for the
period ended May 12 from minus 29.5 the prior week, hovering
around a five-year high reached at the end of last month.  Rising home values and stock prices gains may be
underpinning expectations and bolstering consumer  spending ,
which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. Nonetheless,
the lagged effect of higher payroll taxes are crimping the
discretionary budgets of low- to middle-wage earners, preventing
total demand from accelerating.  “It reflects a broader stabilization of the labor market
and greater confidence in household economic expectations,”
said  Joseph Brusuelas , a senior economist at Bloomberg LP in  New
York . “Should consumers continue to demonstrate an increase in
confidence, they’ll likely slow the rebuilding of savings and
continue to spend a bit more.”  A report today from the Labor Department showed more
Americans than projected  filed applications  for  unemployment
benefits  last week. Jobless claims jumped by 32,000 to 360,000
in the week ended May 11, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey and the most since the end of March.  Housing Starts  The Commerce Department said starts of new homes fell more
than forecast in April to a five-month low, indicating a pause
in the industry’s progress as builders slowed work on
apartments. Starts  slumped  16.5 percent, the most since February
2011, to an 853,000 annualized rate. Building permits surged to
an almost five-year high.  Stocks declined after the figures. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index, which extended a record yesterday, decreased 0.1
percent to 1,656.58 at 9:37 a.m. in New York.  One of the three components of the comfort index climbed
last week while two fell.  The index measuring consumers’ views on their  personal
finances  climbed to 1.8 from 0.8, the fifth straight positive
reading.  The gauge assessing Americans’ views on the current  state
of the economy  was little changed at minus 57.9 compared with
minus 57.8 the prior week. Today’s report also showed the index
of  buying conditions  declined to minus 34.6 from a more than
five-year high of minus 31.5.  Payroll Taxes  That may reflect a higher payroll tax rate, which is eating
into consumers’ finances. At the beginning of 2013, the levy
used to finance  Social Security  reverted to its 2010 rate of 6.2
percent after holding at 4.2 percent for two years. That cost
about $80 per month for households earning $50,000 a year.  Still, a housing-market recovery and advances in equity
prices are boosting household wealth and could prove a boon to
 consumer spending .  Residential  real-estate prices  rose in February by the most
since May 2006, with the S&P/Case-Shiller index of house values
in 20 cities up 9.3 percent from a year ago. U.S. stocks are
being helped by record stimulus by the  Federal Reserve , and the
 S&P 500 (SPX)  index has gained 16.3 percent this year through
yesterday.  The labor market is also adding jobs, albeit at a slower
pace. Payrolls in April climbed by 165,000 workers, the Labor
Department said, after revised gains of 138,000 jobs in March
and 332,000 in February.  Still, companies including equipment manufacturer and
distributor  Deere & Co. (DE)  remain concerned.  Deere Sales  “We now expect industry retail sales of turf and utility
equipment in the U.S. and  Canada  to be flat to down slightly in
2013, reflecting the cool, wet spring in  North America  and
cautious consumer sentiment,” Susan Karlix, director of
 investor relations , said in a May 15 earnings call.  Among age groups, 35 to 44 year-old consumers are the most
confident, with their index jumping last week to minus 10.7, the
highest reading since mid-October 2007, from minus 17.5.  Sentiment rose to its highest level since December 2007
among political independents, climbing to minus 26.1. It has
slipped to late-February levels among Democrats, at minus 28.9.
Republicans are at minus 34.7.  The comfort reading is at its worst since February among 18
to 34 year-old Americans, renters and single adults.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, compiled by Langer
Research Associates in New York, conducts telephone surveys with
a random sample of 1,000 consumers ages 18 and older.  Each week, 250 respondents are asked for their views on the
 U.S. economy , personal finances and buying climate. The
percentage of negative responses is subtracted from the share of
positive views and divided by three. The most recent reading is
based on the average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
