Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the bank
that gets more than half of its revenue from credit-card
lending, plans to dismiss 26 employees later this year at a
facility in Long Island, New York.  The cuts are expected to occur in the fourth quarter at an
office in Brentwood, about 45 miles east of Manhattan, the
McLean, Virginia-based bank said today in a notice with the
state Labor Department. The dismissals are tied to a decision to
outsource the firm’s “cash vault” function in New York and New
Jersey,  Julie Rakes , a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
