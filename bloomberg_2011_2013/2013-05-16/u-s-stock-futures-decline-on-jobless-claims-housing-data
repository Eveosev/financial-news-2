U.S. stock futures dropped as more
Americans than projected filed applications for  unemployment
benefits  last week and starts of new homes fell in April.  S&P 500 futures expiring in June lost 0.1 percent
to 1,652.3 at 8:34 a.m. in  New York . The equity benchmark
rallied 0.5 percent to the highest level on record yesterday.  Jobless claims jumped by 32,000 to 360,000 in the week
ended May 11, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of
economists and the most since the end of March, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington.  Housing starts slumped 16.5 percent, the most since
February 2011, to an 853,000 annualized rate after a revised
1.02 million pace in March, the Commerce Department reported
today in Washington. The median estimate of 81 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 970,000 rate.  Another report showed the cost of living in the U.S. fell
in April for a second month, the first back-to-back declines in
inflation since late 2008, as fuel prices retreated.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
