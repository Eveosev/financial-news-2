Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA,
 Brazil ’s largest electric utility by revenue, rallied after
reporting a first-quarter loss that was less than some analysts
had estimated.  Common shares of Eletrobras, as the company is also known,
surged 8.9 percent to 5.13 reais at 1:04 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , the
biggest intraday advance since March 28. Trading volume was 1.4
times the three-month daily average. It was the best performer
on the Ibovespa equity benchmark, which rose 0.5 percent.  Brazilian utilities’ earnings have been crimped by
President Dilma Rousseff’s decision last year to force them to
lower rates. Eletrobras’s first-quarter net loss of 35.8 million
reais ($18 million) compares with Citigroup Inc.’s estimated
loss of 180 million reais, according to a research note the bank
published today.  “Even weak, the numbers came out a little better than
anticipated,”  Pedro Galdi , an analyst at brokerage SLW, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “But we’re still going to see more
negative effects of the government’s pressure in the coming
quarters.”  The state-run utility’s shares slumped 20 percent this year
while the Bovespa declined 9.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
