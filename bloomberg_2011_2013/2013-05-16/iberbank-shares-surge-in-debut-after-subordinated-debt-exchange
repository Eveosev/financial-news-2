Liberbank (LBK) , a Spanish lender that took
state aid, jumped on its trading debut in  Madrid  after
exchanging subordinated debt for stock.  The shares rose as much as 58 percent to 63 euro cents
compared with its reference price of 40 cents. The stock traded
at 56 cents at 12:53 p.m. in Madrid, valuing the bank at about
791 million euros ($1.02 billion).  Liberbank, formed from a merger of three former savings
banks including Cajastur and Caja Cantabria, took 124 million
euros in state aid after Spain sought 41 billion euros in
European bailout funds for its banking system last year. The
listing of 30 percent of the Madrid-based lender is the first
since Banca Civica SA and  Bankia SA (BKIA)  in 2011.  Under the terms of a recapitalization plan approved by
Europe, Liberbank exchanged 830 million euros of junior debt for
convertible bonds and shares issued at 1.11 euros apiece. The
bank is offering  investors  who hold onto their shares for two
years annual interest of 6 percent on their holdings based on
the book value of 1.11 euros a piece.  Liberbank has about 47 billion euros of assets and 1,158
branches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
