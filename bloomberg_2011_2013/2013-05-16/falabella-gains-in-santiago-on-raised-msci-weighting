SACI Falabella (FALAB) ,  Chile ’s largest
retailer by market value, rose the most in a month after its
weighting increased in an index that fund managers follow as a
benchmark and as Grupo BTG Pactual maintained a buy rating.  The shares advanced 2.7 percent to 5,475 pesos at 3:40 p.m.
in Santiago, the biggest gain on a closing basis since April 16.
Volume was four times the average of the past three months. The
Ipsa index fell 0.3 percent.  “We expect margin recovery, store maturation and a still
strong consumption environment in Chile and  Peru  to drive
double-digit earnings growth in 2013,” BTG Pactual analysts
Alonso Aramburu and Mauricio Restrepo said in a research note,
which reiterated their buy recommendation.  Santiago-based Falabella’s weighting increased to 0.95
percent in the MSCI Latin America index. The boost should lead
to “buying pressure” from funds that track the index, Banco
Santander SA analysts Stefano Rizzi and Jesus Gomez said in an
e-mailed research note to clients today. Falabella previously
had a weighting of 0.67 percent, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
