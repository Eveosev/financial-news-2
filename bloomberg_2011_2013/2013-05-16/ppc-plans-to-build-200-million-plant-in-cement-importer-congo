PPC Ltd. (PPC) , South  Africa ’s biggest
cement maker, plans a new $200 million plant in Democratic
Republic of Congo, a net importer of the material, as the
company expands in sub-Saharan Africa.  The plant, with a production capacity of 1 million metric
tons, will be close to Kinshasa, the capital, PPC’s Chief
Executive Officer Ketso Gordhan said in a phone interview from
Johannesburg today. “The country has requirements of about 3
millions tons a year and imports at least 1 million tons.”  PPC is expanding in new countries to boost income amid
tougher competition in South Africa. The Johannesburg-based
company will have three new plants operating in Congo, Rwanda
and Ethiopia by the end of 2015, expanding capacity to as much
as 11 million tons from 8 million tons. The company plans to tap
the capital market for a further 650 million rand ($69.5
million) after an initial auction of about the same amount in
March, according to Gordhan.  Construction of the new Congo plant will start by the end
of 2013 in partnership with  China ’s  Sinoma International
Engineering Co. (600970) , Gordhan said.  PPC’s earnings for the fiscal year ending September 2013
will be “very similar” to the prior period, he said. The
company said today that profit dropped 20 percent in the first
half through March 31 on costs associated with  Zimbabwe ’s
ownership laws.  PPC  shares  declined 4.1 percent to 33.33 rand by 12:38 p.m.
in Johannesburg, the biggest intraday fall since April 15. The
stock has weakened 3.6 percent this year, compared with a 5.4
percent rise in the 166-member FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
