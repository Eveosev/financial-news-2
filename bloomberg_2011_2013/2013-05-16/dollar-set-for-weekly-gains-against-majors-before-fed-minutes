The  Dollar Index (DXY)  climbed to the
highest level in almost three years amid speculation the Federal
Reserve is moving closer to ending its program of asset
purchases on signs U.S. economic growth is improving.  The greenback rose versus all of its 16 most-traded peers
as U.S. leading indicators improved and  consumer confidence  rose
to the highest in almost six years. The American currency
climbed past 103 yen for the first time since October 2008. The
Australian and New Zealand dollars slid on concern slowing
global inflation will damp demand for commodities.  “Investors are gradually getting more structurally
positive on the U.S. economy, and that has been supporting the
dollar,” Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“The confidence data today was extremely strong, as was the
leading indicators, which supports the view that the U.S.
economy is not in such a bad shape.”  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, climbed as much as 0.9 percent to 84.371, the highest
level since July 2010, before trading at 84.207 at 5 p.m. New
York time, up 0.7 percent.  The greenback appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.2839 per euro,
extending the week’s gain to 1.2 percent. The dollar rose 0.9
percent to 103.21 yen and touched 103.31, advancing 1.6 percent
on the week. The yen fell 0.6 percent to 132.51 per euro.  A gauge of currency-market  volatility  rose to the highest
level in 11 weeks. The JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index, based on
three-month futures options on Group of Seven nations’
currencies, reached 9.96 percent, the highest since Feb. 27. It
has averaged 9.1 percent in 2013.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $42 billion, compared with $47 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the euro-dollar exchange rate amounted to $9.2 billion, the
largest share of trades at 22 percent. Dollar-yen options were
the second most-actively traded, at $7.9 billion, or 19 percent.
Australian-U.S. dollar options were No. 3 at $3.7 billion, or 9
percent.  Euro-dollar options trading was 193 percent above the
average for the past five Fridays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Dollar-yen options trading was
44 percent below average.  Aussie Reversal  Futures traders reversed their bets the Australian dollar
will gain against the U.S. dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the Australian dollar
compared with those on a gain -- so-called  net shorts  -- was
13,450 on May 14, the most since June 2012, versus net longs of
6,630 a week earlier.  The Australian dollar dropped as much as 1 percent to 97.11
U.S. cents, the weakest since June 5, before trading at 97.30
cents, down 0.8 percent. New Zealand’s dollar, known as the
kiwi, slid 1.2 percent to 80.61 U.S. cents, a level unseen since
Nov. 16, before trading at 80.65, down 1.1 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24  raw materials  slid
7.8 percent from Feb. 14, when it reached a high for 2013,
through yesterday. It was up 0.7 percent today.  Loonie Weakens  The Canadian dollar dropped against most major peers after
inflation fell to its slowest in more than three years,
bolstering the case for lower interest rates. Canada’s  consumer
price index  rose 0.4 percent in April from a year ago, compared
with a 1 percent gain the prior month, the government said. It
was the slowest since October 2009. The Bank of Canada has kept
its benchmark rate at 1 percent since 2010.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.8 percent to
C$1.0281 per U.S. dollar and touched C$1.0313, the weakest since
March 8.  South Africa’s rand fell to a four-year low on concern
labor unrest and lower commodities will damp growth. The
currency sank 0.9 percent to 9.4038 per dollar and reached
9.4413, the weakest level since April 2009.  The dollar jumped versus the euro and yen as the Conference
Board’s index of U.S. leading indicators, a gauge of the outlook
for the next three to six months, climbed 0.6 percent in April,
the New York-based group said today. A Bloomberg survey called
for a 0.2 percent increase.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of U.S.  consumer sentiment  rose to 83.7 in May, the
highest since July 2007, from 76.4 the prior month. A Bloomberg
survey predicted a gain to 77.9.  ‘Dollar Story’  “It’s really a dollar story,” said Neil Jones, the head
of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London .
“The world is really watching the U.S. data at the moment.”  Fed Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said
yesterday economic growth and job-market gains may prompt the
central bank to taper its $85 billion of monthly bond buying
under the quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.  Williams, who doesn’t vote on policy this year, was one of
the first Fed officials to advocate the central bank buy bonds
without setting a limit on the duration or total for such
purchases. The Federal Open Market Committee said May 1 it’s
prepared to increase or decrease the size of its purchases as
officials gauge the health of the economy.  The FOMC will release minutes of its April 30-May 1 meeting
on May 22.  “Market anticipation that the Fed minutes next week will
reflect that kind of thinking is probably underpinning demand
for the dollar,” said  Henrik Gullberg , a London-based currency
strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.  The greenback has appreciated 5.5 percent in 2013 against
nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, the best performance. The yen slumped 13
percent, the biggest loss, while the euro gained 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
