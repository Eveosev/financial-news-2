German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that the euro risks falling apart unless European Union nations
cede some sovereignty and work toward closer economic and
budgetary cooperation.  “We have to talk about how we coordinate our national
economic policies -- how much do we invest, what are our labor
costs and many other things that also have to be coordinated”
among EU countries, Merkel said during a WDR television panel
discussion on  Europe  in Berlin today. “Otherwise, a joint
currency can’t exist.”  Merkel cited the example of one country spending the
equivalent of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product on research
and another 0.1 percent, saying that if “this goes on over a
period over 20 years, there will be such tension within the
currency that we won’t be able to keep it together.”  The answer is “more coordination, not just on fiscal
policy but on economic policy as well,” she said.  The comments are the strongest yet by Merkel, the key
political policy maker during more than three years of the euro-area debt crisis, spurring  Germany ’s European partners to
bolster their competitiveness through reforms and emulating the
most successful economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
