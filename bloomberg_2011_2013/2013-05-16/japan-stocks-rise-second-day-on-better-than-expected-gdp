Japanese stocks fell, with the  Topix
Index (TPX)  retreating from a 4 1/2-year high, as technical indicators
signaled the market may be overheating and Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. led banks lower on earnings.  Banks dropped the most among the 33 Topix industry groups
after Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.
forecast lower earnings as monetary easing weighs on loan
profitability. Nippon Paper Industries Co. dropped 6.2 percent
after MSCI Inc. said it’s removing the stock from its Japan
index. Olympus Corp. surged 18 percent after the maker of
endoscopes projected profit that topped analyst estimates. Tokyo
Electric Power Co. jumped 19 percent to lead advancing shares on
the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  The Topix lost 0.6 percent to close at 1,245.23 in Tokyo
after yesterday closing at the highest level since Aug. 29,
2008. More than three stocks fell for each that gained. The
Nikkei 225 dropped 0.4 percent to 15,037.24. Stocks rose earlier
after data showed  Japan ’s economy expanded more than expected.  “You may not be able to expect much of a pickup in bank
lending,” said Takahiro Nakano, a Tokyo-based strategist at
Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest
lender. “The market sees the GDP report in a wholly positive
light, but on the other hand, we are seeing overheating signs.”  The Topix has risen 46 percent this year through yesterday,
outperforming all major equity indexes amid unprecedented bond-buying from the Bank of Japan. The guage traded at 1.4 times
book value, compared with about 2.5 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Overheating Signs  The Topix’s 14-day relative strength index, a measure of
trading momentum, held yesterday above the 70 threshold that
some traders say signals the index will decline. The 25-day
Toraku index, which compares the number of rising and falling
stocks on the Topix, was above the 120 reading yesterday that
indicates a drop is probable.  Of the 796 companies on  the Topix  that have reported full-year earnings since April 1, and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 479 beat analysts’ projections.  Lenders fell after projecting smaller profits amid Bank of
Japan policies that keep interest margins the lowest in Asia.
Mitsubishi UFJ lost 3.6 percent to 706 yen after saying annual
profit will slip 11 percent. Sumitomo Mitsui fell 3 percent to
4,770 yen after forecasting a 27 percent profit drop.  Nippon Paper dropped 6.2 percent to 1,502 yen after MSCI
said it would remove the stock from its Japan index on May 31,
along with Denki Kagaku Kogyou KK, GS Yuasa Corp., and Ushio
Inc. Chemical-maker Denki Kagaku fell 4.5 percent to 380 yen. GS
Yuasa, the battery producer, lost 2 percent to 452 yen. Ushio,
which makes projectors for movie theaters, added 1.4 percent to
1,326 yen.  Growth Accelerates  Shares fell even as Japan’s economic growth accelerated.
Gains in consumer spending and exports helped gross domestic
product expand an annualized 3.5 percent, the most in a year, a
Cabinet Office report showed today in  Tokyo . The median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 2.7 percent gain.  Among stocks that rose, Olympus jumped 18 percent to 3,215
yen, the highest since Sept. 29, 2008. The maker optical
equipment forecast a 30 billion yen profit this fiscal year,
beating the average analyst estimate of 28 billion yen.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised the stock’s rating to overweight.  Tokyo Electric surged 19 percent to 613 yen. The stock is
heading for 37 percent advance this week after Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe was quoted by the Yomiuri newspaper as saying Japan’s
biggest power utility shouldn’t take full blame for the
Fukushima meltdowns.  Dai-ichi Advances  Eurus Energy Holdings Corp., a joint venture between Tepco
and Toyota Tsusho Corp., yesterday announce plans to build a
115-megawatt solar power station in northern Japan.  Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. added 3.9 percent to 161,600
yen after projecting net income will rise 14 percent to 37
billion yen in the current fiscal year. It plans to boost its
dividend by 400 yen to 2,000 yen.  Futures on the S&P 500 declined 0.1 percent today. The
index rose 0.5 percent to a fresh record in New York yesterday
even after U.S. industrial production declined in April by the
most in eight months.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index rose 0.2 percent
to 26.65, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.6 percent
on the benchmark guage during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
