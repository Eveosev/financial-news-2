Washington  regulators proposed rules
for growing, processing and selling marijuana for recreational
use, as the state joins Colorado in legalizing the drug for non-medical purposes.  The regulations would require licenses with background
checks on applicants, laboratory testing of marijuana products
and taxes on retail sales of as much as 25 percent, according to
a draft by the state Liquor Control Board, which is responsible
for implementing the law approved by voters in November.  “The initial rules balance our goal of developing a
tightly regulated system with reasonable access for small and
large business models to participate within the system,” Sharon
Foster, the board’s chair, said in a statement.  Washington and Colorado voters approved ballot measures
legalizing recreational use of marijuana last year. Washington
is to begin issuing licenses to producers, processors and
retailers by Dec. 1. Colorado passed legislation regulating the
new industry this month and will begin sales on Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
