Navistar International Corp. (NAV)  said it
sold its recreational vehicle business to Allied Specialty
Vehicles Inc. No terms were disclosed.  Navistar, the Lisle, Illinois-based truckmaker, is
concentrating on its main business “and the sale of Navistar RV
represents another important step,” Chief Operating Officer
 Jack Allen  said in a statement.  Navistar, since August, has installed a new management team
as it tries to end losses. The company promoted Troy Clarke to
chief executive officer in March, replacing interim boss Lewis Campbell. The company ousted Dan Ustian as CEO last year.  Allied Specialty Vehicles, based in Orlando, Florida, also
entered into a leasing agreement for a Navistar recreational
vehicle facility in Elkhart,  Indiana , according to today’s
statement. The sale doesn’t include Bison Coach, Navistar’s
horse trailer manufacturing business.  Navistar fell 0.3 percent to $36.22 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 66 percent this year, compared with
a 16 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
