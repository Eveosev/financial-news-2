An Uzbek national living in Boise,
 Idaho , faces U.S. charges that he conspired to support a
terrorist organization, the Islamic  Movement of Uzbekistan , and
taught others how to make bombs.  Fazliddin Kurbanov, 30, was arrested yesterday on federal
charges filed in Boise and in Salt Lake City, according to a
Justice Department statement. In Idaho he’s charged with
conspiring to provide material support to the Uzbek movement and
in  Utah  he’s charged with providing instructions on how to build
improvised explosive devices.  “One of our highest priorities is disrupting potential
acts of terrorism,” David Barlow, the U.S. attorney in Salt
Lake City, said in the statement. “The coordinated
investigation, arrest, and indictments in this case demonstrate
the commitment of all involved to do just that.”  Kurbanov is scheduled to make his initial court appearance
today and prosecutors expect that a lawyer for him will be
appointed at that time, Deborah Bertram, a spokeswoman for the
 Federal Bureau of Investigation  in  Salt Lake City , said in an e-mail.  Kurbanov faces a possible sentence of 45 years in prison on
the Idaho charges if convicted and 20 years in the Utah case.  The Idaho case is U.S. v. Kurbanov, 13-0120, U.S. District
Court, District of Idaho (Boise).  To contact the reporter on this story:
