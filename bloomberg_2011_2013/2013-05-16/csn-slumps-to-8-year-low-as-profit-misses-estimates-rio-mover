Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (SID) , the
third-largest Brazilian steelmaker, dropped to the lowest in
almost eight years after posting a first-quarter profit that
missed analysts’ estimates.  CSN, as the company is known,  fell  0.5 percent to 6.68
reais at 2:18 p.m. in  Sao Paulo  after falling as much as 3.1
percent. A close at this level would be the lowest since July
11, 2005. The stock traded at 1.1 percent of its three-month
daily average volume.  CSN  said  yesterday that net income for controlling
shareholders dropped 75 percent to 27.3 million reais ($13.5
million) from $110.7 million a year earlier, missing a 168.5
million reais average estimate that excludes some items of eight
analysts in a Bloomberg  survey . Profit at the Sao Paulo-based
company was affected by a worse-than-expected operational
performance in its mining unit, Citigroup Inc. analysts
Alexander Hacking and Thiago Ojea said.  “The main weakness was iron-ore sales,” the analysts said
in a research note today. “Concerns include high debt,
investment priorities and limited visibility on corporate
strategy.”  (CSN is scheduled to hold a  conference call  with investors
today at 2 p.m.  New York  time.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
