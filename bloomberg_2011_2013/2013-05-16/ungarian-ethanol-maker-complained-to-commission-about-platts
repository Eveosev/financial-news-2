Pannonia Ethanol, a Hungarian
producer of ethanol fuel, lodged a complaint with the European
Commission last year after price reporting agency Platts  denied
it the opportunity to contribute to setting prices.  For more than a year the company sought access to Platt’s
daily half-hour window during which it sets price benchmarks for
different fuels on the basis of bids and offers by its
participants, even though it complied with all the requests for
additional information, said spokesman Mark Brennock.  “Pannonia Ethanol has unsuccessfully sought access to the
Platts ethanol window for over twelve months to trade its
ethanol products,” Brennock said in an e-mailed statement.
“After being repeatedly turned down by Platts, the company
lodged a complaint late last year with the European Commission
solely and specifically about access to Platts for trading
ethanol products.”  The European Commission is investigating  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) ,  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and Platts, a unit of  McGraw Hill
Financial Inc. (MHFI) , about potential manipulation of prices. The
probe extends to undisclosed crude-derived products and
biofuels.  “To produce benchmarks of the highest quality, Platts
engages in a thorough vetting process by which interested
participants must demonstrate that they can meet the
requirements of our published methodology,” spokeswoman
Kathleen Tanzy said. “Platts followed this established process
with Pannonia Ethanol.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
