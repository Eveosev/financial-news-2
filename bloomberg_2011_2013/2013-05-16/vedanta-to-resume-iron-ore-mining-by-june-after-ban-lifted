Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , controlled by
billionaire Anil Agarwal, is planning to resume iron ore mining
in  India ’s Karnataka region by June after the country’s top
court lifted a 21-month ban imposed for environmental
violations.  India’s Supreme Court last month allowed Vedanta’s iron ore
unit  Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA)  and eight other companies to restart
operations in Karnataka. The Supreme Court suspended extraction
in the western state of Goa pending a probe into violations of
mining regulations. The ban followed a similar action in
neighboring Karnataka in August 2011. Karnataka in July 2010
barred iron-ore exports to increase local supplies of the
steelmaking ingredient.  Vedanta has “no clarity” about when the ban on exporting
iron ore will be removed, Chief Executive Officer Mahendra Singh Mehta said in a conference call. “That’s not our priority right
now. As we start production and ramp up the volume we’ll engage
on that also.”  Vedanta’s full-year net income more than doubled to $157.4
million in the fiscal year ended March 31 from $59.8 million a
year earlier, the company said in a statement today.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 21 percent to $4.89 billion, while sales grew
7 percent to $14.9 billion. The company proposed a final
dividend of 37 cents a share, increasing the total dividend to
58 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
