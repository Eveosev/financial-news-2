Gold has the worst 12-month outlook
among commodities and will trade below $1,400 an ounce in a
year, according to an investor poll by  Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   Sixty percent of respondents named bullion as having the
worst outlook, 18 percent picked copper and 16 percent selected
corn, the bank said in an e-mailed report today. Fifty-one
percent predicted gold will fall under $1,400 in 12 months, it
said. The bank polled 185 investors including  hedge funds ,
pension funds and family offices on May 15 in London.  “Bearishness for gold was a very clear consensus,” said
Kamal Naqvi, the head of commodities sales for Europe,  Middle
East  and Africa at Credit Suisse. “It’s not about just not
buying gold, it’s about shorting it,” or wagering on a drop.  Gold slumped into a  bear market  last month as investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value. Bullion is down 17
percent this year, compared with the 2.9 percent drop for the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of raw materials.  Fifty-three percent of investors expect commodity prices to
stay near current levels, Credit Suisse said. Most were
underweight raw materials or had zero exposure, while they
expected to be overweight or neutral in 12 months, the bank
said. Investors named relative value trades, fundamentally based
directional trades and volatility as the best ways to extract
value from commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
