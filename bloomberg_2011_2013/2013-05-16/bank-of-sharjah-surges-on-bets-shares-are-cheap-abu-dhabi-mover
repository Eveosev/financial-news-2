Bank of Sharjah  gained the most in
almost four months on investor bets the emirate’s largest bank
is cheap compared with peers.  The  stock  soared 9.4 percent, the most since Jan. 27, to
close at 1.75 dirhams as 2.2 million shares traded, or 4.6 times
the three-month daily average.  Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark index rose
less than 0.1 percent, rising for an 11th day. The bank, which
has a 12-month dividend yield of 5.7 compared with 4.7 for Abu
Dhabi’s banking index, last month reported a 23 percent jump in
first-quarter profit.  United Arab Emirates lenders are advancing as they benefit
from an economic recovery, with Abu Dhabi’s government
restarting stalled projects and Dubai restructuring its debt.
Shares of  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the country’s second-biggest bank,
have more than doubled this year, while those of Dubai Islamic
Bank climbed 58 percent in the period.  “It’s still cheap,” said  Jaap Meijer , a director of
equity research at Dubai-based Arqaam Capital Ltd. Bank of
Sharjah “Investors are looking for deep value after rallies of
Emirates NBD and Dubai Islamic Bank.”  Bank of Sharjah (BOS)  shares, which are up 37 percent this year,
trade at a price-to-book value of 0.7 times, compared with 1.4
times for Abu Dhabi’s ADX Banks Index. Emirates NBD’s and Dubai
Islamic Bank’s are at 0.9 percent.  Sharjah is one of the seven emirates that make up the
U.A.E.  To contact the reporter on this story:
