Strict quality checks of scrap copper
 shipments  to  China  and a slowdown in U.S. recycling are boosting
demand for ore at refiners in the biggest user of base metals.  Chinese ports began tighter enforcement of existing
regulations in February to weed out low-grade scrap, Ma Xiaoxin,
deputy head of the copper department at state-owned China
Minmetals Nonferrous Metals Co., said in a phone interview from
Beijing yesterday.  Miners including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Codelco may benefit
with ore  imports  jumping 26 percent in the first quarter while
inbound scrap copper  shipments  fell 4.6 percent in the four
months through April, according to customs data. About 32
percent of the country’s  refined copper  was derived from scrap
last year, according to the China Nonferrous Metals Industry
Association.  “The growth of China’s refined production using ore has
been fairly quick,” said Duan Shaofu, deputy head of the heavy
metals department at the metals association. China’s refined
output this year may rise 8 percent to 6.3 million metric tons,
Duan said.  Global demand will outpace supply by 269,000 tons in the
six months through September, cutting this year’s glut to 92,000
tons, Barclays Plc estimates. That’s down from a 142,000-ton
surplus in 2012.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange tumbled to $6,762.25 a ton on April 23, the lowest
since October 2011, and traded at $7,222.75 at 2 p.m.  Shanghai 
time. It has fallen 9 percent this year. Shares of BHP, the
world’s biggest miner, fell 1.1 percent to A$33.67 in Sydney
trading. Chile’s state-owned Codelco isn’t listed.  “Full Impact”  “Cargoes that don’t meet the standards will be sent back,
so it damps buyer willingness to place orders,” Zhang Lin, head
of the information office at the recycling metal branch at the
metals association, said May 10. “As transport and logistics
take time, the full impact may have not emerged yet.”  A call to the press office of the customs agency today to
seek comment was not answered.  The slump in copper prices this year kept scrap dealers on
the sidelines, creating an artificial shortage, said Ma of
Minmetals. They may return if prices rise to $7,500, she said.  Copper will trade at $7,750 in the fourth quarter, the
median of 30 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  “The scrap price isn’t very competitive,” Zhang said.
“Companies tend to use more ore if they can.”  The  implied  average price of scrap copper imports in China
in March was $3,326 a ton, 13 percent higher than December.  Home Appliances  Almost two-thirds of scrap copper used by China, the
largest producer of refined metal, was imported last year,
according to Ma. The U.S. accounted for about 21 percent of
imports during the first quarter and through 2012, according to
calculations by Bloomberg based on government data.  China bought 217,685 tons from the U.S. in the first
quarter, 6.7 percent lower from a year ago, customs data show.
Scrap supplies in the U.S. may drop 20 percent this year as
recycling of home appliances and machinery slows, she said.  “Tight scrap supply led to a drop in utilization rates of
refined producers,” said Zhu Wenjun, an analyst at data
provider SMM Information & Technology Co. in Shanghai.
“Operation rates declined 2.53 percentage points to 89.45
percent in April and may slide further to about 88 percent in
May.”  China’s copper  output  rose 11 percent in the first three
months to 1.55 million tons, data from the metal association
showed. The country produced 5.82 million tons last year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
