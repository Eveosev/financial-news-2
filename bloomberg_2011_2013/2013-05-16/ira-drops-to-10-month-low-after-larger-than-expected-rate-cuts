The Turkish lira weakened to its
lowest intraday level since July 2012 and bond yields fell to a
record after the central bank reduced  interest rates  more than
forecast.  The lira fell to as low as 1.8309 a dollar and depreciated
0.3% to 1.8274 at 2:28 p.m. in Istanbul, extending this year’s
decline to 2.4 percent. Yields on two-year bonds tumbled 19
basis points to a record 4.85 percent.  The central bank cut its benchmark repo rate to 4.5 percent
from 5 percent.  The bank  also lowered its overnight lending and
overnight borrowing rates by 50 basis points each, to 6.5
percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. The bank was expected to
cut all three rates by a quarter point, according to Bloomberg
surveys of economists.  “Despite recent weakness in the lira, the size of the cut
highlights the central bank’s concern with the acceleration in
capital inflows, driven by quantitative-easing led demand,”

of  Scotland  in London, wrote in e-mailed comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
