U.S.  mortgage rates  rose, pushing
borrowing costs for a 30-year loan to the highest in six weeks.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to
3.51 percent in the week ended today, up from 3.42 percent and
the highest since early April, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie
Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-year rate increased to
2.69 percent from 2.61 percent.  Home-loan costs have increased after hovering close to
record lows early this month. Low rates are fueling a frenzy of
demand in some markets as buyers compete for a tight  supply  of
properties. While values remain well below their peak, 133 of
the 150 metropolitan areas tracked by the National Association
of Realtors had price increases in the first quarter from a year
earlier. Areas such as  San Francisco , Atlanta, Phoenix and Reno,
Nevada, saw jumps of more than 30 percent.  “In many ways, it’s the same mentality as what saw in the
boom,”  Jonathan Miller , president of New York-based appraiser
Miller Samuel Inc., said in a telephone interview. “The only
difference is that we have tight credit that is keeping the
process close to honest for the time being.”  The record rate for a 30-year mortgage is 3.31 percent,
reached in November, according to  Freddie Mac . The 15-year
average fell to a record-low 2.56 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
