William Lyon Homes, a builder that
emerged from bankruptcy last year, fell in  New York  trading
after a public share sale and reverse stock split.  The homebuilder, which had traded over the counter, and an
existing investor sold 8.7 million shares yesterday for $25
apiece. That exceeded the $22 to $24 a share the Newport Beach,
California-based company initially expected to receive.  William Lyon traded at $26.13 at 1:34 p.m., down 12 percent
from yesterday’s close of $29.70, after adjusting for a 1 for
8.25 reverse split, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The
stock rose 4.5 percent from the price of the public offering.  The company joins at least two U.S. homebuilders that
conducted public offerings this year as investors seek to
capitalize on the housing-market recovery. New-home demand has
risen as buyers, seeking to take advantage of low  mortgage 
rates, find a tight  supply  of existing properties for sale.  “William Lyon is located in several markets that are
growing swiftly,” Megan McGrath, an analyst with MKM Partners
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , wrote in a note yesterday before
the pricing. “However, its locations combined with its long
land supply in those areas -- we estimate 16 years of supply in
 Arizona  -- creates longer-term risk, in our view, if sales pace
in its chosen markets begins to ease.”  The company’s backers include Paulson & Co., the firm run
by John Paulson, who earned $15 billion in 2007 betting against
subprime mortgages; Luxor Capital Group LP, a New York-based
investment manager; and Thomas Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital LLC,
which lent $206 million to William Lyon before its bankruptcy.
Luxor offered about 2.2 million shares in the sale, aiming to
trim its stake to 30 percent from 47 percent. Paulson’s stake
was set to decrease to 11 percent from 14 percent, and Colony’s
stake  to 3.9 percent from 5 percent.  Net Loss  William Lyon had a net loss of $11.6 million on revenue of
$372.8 million from Feb. 25, 2012, when it emerged from
bankruptcy, to Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing. The
company sold 883 homes for an average price of $277,000 at
communities in  California , Arizona,  Nevada  and  Colorado .  The stock sale was led by Credit Suisse Group AG and
Citigroup Inc. The shares are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol WLH.  Tri Pointe Homes Inc., an  Irvine , California-based builder
backed by Barry Sternlicht and co-founded by former William Lyon
executives Doug Bauer, Thomas Mitchell and Michael Grubbs,
raised $267.6 million in a January IPO, including the
overallotment option.  Taylor Morrison Home Corp., based in Scottsdale, Arizona
and backed by Howard Marks’ Oaktree Capital Group LLC and David Bonderman’s TPG Capital, raised $722.9 million in an April IPO,
including the overallotment option.  To contact the reporter on this story:
