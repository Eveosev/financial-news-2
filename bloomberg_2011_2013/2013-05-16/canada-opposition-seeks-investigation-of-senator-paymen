Canada ’s main opposition New
Democratic Party is calling for an investigation into a C$90,000
($88,600) payment by Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s chief of
staff to Conservative Senator Mike Duffy.  Charlie Angus, an NDP lawmaker, wrote to Senate Ethics
Officer Lyse Ricard to ask for a probe into the payment and is
calling on Harper to set up a separate investigation into the
matter, according to a  statement .  Andrew MacDougall, director of communications for Harper,
acknowledged in a statement yesterday that Nigel Wright,
Harper’s chief of staff, wrote a check on his personal account
to Duffy to cover most of the amount the lawmaker owed the
Senate for ineligible expenses he had claimed.  “I hope the Senate Ethics Officer acts quickly to launch
an investigation into Mr. Duffy’s actions,” Angus said in the
statement. “With the prime minister’s own Chief of Staff in the
middle, I also urge Conservatives to agree to immediately put in
place an independent advisor to investigate these serious
allegations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
