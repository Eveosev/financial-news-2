Total investment in the media centers
used during last year’s London Olympics rose to 1 billion pounds
($1.5 billion),  Innovation City , a unit of data center provider
Infinity SDC Ltd., said.  Innovation City, known as iCITY, signed a deal with the
London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) to create a
“leading and creative digital hub,” in east London, it said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The hub will create 4,500 jobs on site, with an additional
2,000 posts in the local area, and will add 450 million pounds
to the British economy, iCITY said.  “It’s absolutely fantastic news that the final piece of
the Olympic venues jigsaw puzzle has now been firmly put in
place,” London Mayor  Boris Johnson  said in the statement.
“With the future of eight out of eight permanent venues secure,
London has well and truly delivered on what is a hugely
important part of the Olympic legacy story.”  London won the right to host the 2012 Olympics, which cost
9.3 billion pounds, in 2005 by promising it would regenerate
parts of east London, which has some of the more deprived areas
in the U.K.  “We said from the very beginning there would be no white
elephants on the Olympic Park -- and we’ve kept our promise,”
Dennis Hone, Chief Executive Officer of the LLDC, said. “Now,
by securing high quality tenants in the tech and education
sectors, we will be providing thousands of jobs -- and we remain
firmly on track to deliver a meaningful physical and social
legacy for Londoners.”  The media centers, located in the northwest corner of the
Olympic Park in Stratford in east  London , housed 20,000
journalists during the games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
