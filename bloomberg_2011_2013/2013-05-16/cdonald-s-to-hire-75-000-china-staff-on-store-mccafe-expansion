McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s largest
restaurant chain, said it plans to hire 75,000 new employees in
China this year as the company accelerates store expansion in
the world’s most populous country.  The new hiring represents an increase of as much as 83
percent of the  Oak Brook , Illinois-based company’s workforce in
the Asian nation. McDonald’s has more than 90,000 employees in
China currently, the company said in e-mailed statement today.  Restaurant chains such as McDonald’s and  Burger King
Worldwide Inc. (BKW)  are accelerating store openings in China as
rising incomes and busy lifestyles boost demand for quick meals
in the world’s second-largest economy. China’s chained fast-food
industry will probably expand 14 percent to 115.1 billion  yuan 
($18.7 billion) this year from 2012, according to researcher
Euromonitor International.  McDonald’s plans to increase the number of outlets on the
mainland by 300 to 2,000 this year. The Big Mac seller opened
256 stores in the Asian nation in 2012.  The new positions announced today will consist mostly of
store staff and 2,000 jobs will be for coffee baristas at its
McCafe outlets, the company said. The number of McCafes will
increase by 45 percent this year to 750, it said.  McDonald’s had a 15.6 percent share of China’s 86.9 billion
yuan fast-food industry as of 2011, according to the most recent
figures by London-based Euromonitor. It trails the 39 percent
share for  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , the operator of KFC and Pizza Hut
restaurants, according to Euromonitor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
