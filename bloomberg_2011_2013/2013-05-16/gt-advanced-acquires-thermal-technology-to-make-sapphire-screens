GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (GTAT) , a U.S.
supplier of manufacturing equipment for solar and energy-efficient lighting products, acquired Thermal Technology LLC in
a deal that values the supplier of high-temperature furnaces at
more than $14.7 million.  GT Advanced provided 3.4 million shares of common stock and
agreed to pay an unspecified amount in the future, the Nashua,
New Hampshire-based company said in a statement today. Jeff Nestel-Patt, a company spokesman, declined to provide additional
information until a conference call tomorrow at 8 a.m. New York
time.  GT Advanced rose 3.1 percent to $4.31 at the close in New
York, the highest since Nov. 2. The acquisition will add about
$9 million to $14 million in sales this year.  Closely held Thermal Technology, based in Santa Rosa,
 California , makes high-temperature thermal and vacuum systems
that GT Advanced will use to make products including sapphire
cover screens for touch-sensitive electronic devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
