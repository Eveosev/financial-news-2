Copper is poised to drop 16 percent
by end of September to the lowest level in three years as it
completes an Elliott Wave correction, according to  technical
analysis  by Shanghai Cifco Futures Co.  The base metal is in a rebound stage after completing its
third bearish cycle from February to April, said trading manager
Hu Kaixi. The surge may last until the end of June and then
decline to $6,037.50 a metric ton, he said. Elliott Wave theory,
created in 1930s by American accountant and author  Ralph Nelson
Elliott , seeks to predict moves in markets by dividing past
trends into five sections, or waves.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was at $7,175 at 8:51 a.m. in Beijing, down 9.5 percent
this year. The metal, used in tubes and wires, may rise to
$7,600 in the short-term in the current rebound phase, he said.  “From a long-term perspective copper is now in a downtrend,
after its spectacular five-wave bull run in the decade between
2001 to 2011,” he said. “In the next wave down, during July to
September, it will drop to perhaps as low as $6,037.50.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
