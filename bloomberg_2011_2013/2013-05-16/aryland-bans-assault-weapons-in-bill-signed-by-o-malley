Maryland Governor  Martin O’Malley 
signed a gun-control measure into law that bans new sales of
assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, and sets new
permit requirements for handgun owners.  The restrictions signed today, which were sought by the
Democratic governor and passed the legislature last month, would
bar those with a history of mental illness from possessing
firearms, and require handgun owners to obtain a license and
submit fingerprints to the state police.  Maryland follows New York, Colorado and  Connecticut  in
limiting firearms ownership after the killing of 20 students and
six educators Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in
Newtown, Connecticut. The action in those states contrasts with
Washington, where President  Barack Obama ’s push for new gun
regulations, including a ban on military-style assault weapons,
has stalled in Congress amid opposition from gun-rights
lobbyists.  The measures in  Maryland  will toughen what are already some
of the most restrictive gun laws in the country, according to
the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a San Francisco-based
group that backs tighter limits on firearms.  The ban on assault weapons won’t affect existing gun
owners, and businesses will be allowed to sell them until the
law takes effect in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
