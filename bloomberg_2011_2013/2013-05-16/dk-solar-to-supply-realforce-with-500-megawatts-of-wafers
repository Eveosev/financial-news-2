LDK Solar Co., the Chinese solar-panel maker that has reported seven straight quarters of losses,
said it agreed to provide 500 megawatts of wafers to Realforce
Power Co.  The company will start shipments this month through
December 2014 to Realforce, a solar-cell and panel maker in
 China ’s eastern province of Shandong, it said today in a
statement on its website. Financial details weren’t disclosed.  LDK reported last month that it had a net loss of $517
million in the last three months of 2012 and that its cash
holdings were at a three-year low of $98.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
