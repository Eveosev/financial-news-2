Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  won a
court order barring ex-employees who went to competing chipmaker
Nvidia Corp. from disclosing trade secrets or soliciting former
colleagues to join them.  U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman said in his order that
AMD may win its lawsuit claiming misappropriation of
confidential information, according to a filing yesterday in
 Boston .  AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, accused ex-employees
of taking sensitive company documents when they went to work for
 Nvidia. (NVDA)  The former employees transferred more than 100,000
electronic files pertaining to AMD’s graphics-processor business
in the days before their departure, AMD said in its complaint
filed in January. The employees also allegedly recruited other
AMD workers to leave the company.  “The circumstantial evidence presented by AMD is
compelling,” Hillman said in his order. “They all made copies
of confidential AMD information before leaving AMD, retained
that information, and immediately began working at a significant
competitor. AMD therefore has a reasonable likelihood of success
on the merits with regard to its claims for misappropriation of
trade secrets.”  The preliminary injunction replaces a temporary restraining
order granted after the suit was filed.  Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, isn’t a defendant
in the suit.  The case is Advanced Micro Devices v. Feldstein, 13-cv-40007, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
