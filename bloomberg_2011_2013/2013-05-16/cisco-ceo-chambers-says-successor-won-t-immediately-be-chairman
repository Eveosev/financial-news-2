Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Chambers said his successor probably
won’t immediately hold both roles.  It’s appropriate to split the positions when there is a new
CEO, he said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“In the Loop with  Betty Liu .”  “We will probably do that when my succession occurs for a
couple years, and then if the CEO is successful, then combining
the two roles is the most likely outcome,” Chambers said.  Chambers’ comments come as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Jamie Dimon faces a shareholder vote on May 21 over whether he should
be allowed to serve in both roles. Chambers, 63, said Dimon is
needed even more during “tough times” at the company.  “I’d be surprised if they don’t keep him chairman and CEO
together,” he said.  Calls for Dimon, 57, to relinquish the chairmanship have
mounted since last May, when JPMorgan disclosed lapses in risk
controls at its chief investment office that led to at least
$6.2 billion in losses on derivatives.  Chambers has been CEO at Cisco, the biggest maker of
networking equipment, since 1995, making his tenure one of the
longest in the technology industry. He indicated last year that
he may retire in two to four years, and has said that as many as
10 of the San Jose, California-based company’s executives are
being evaluated for the job.  To contact the reporter on this story:
