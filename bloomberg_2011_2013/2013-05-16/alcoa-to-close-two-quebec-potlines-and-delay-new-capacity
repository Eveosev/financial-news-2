Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, is shutting two production lines in  Canada  and
postponing construction of a new line at the plant until 2019 as
the metal’s price falls.  The potlines to be shut at the company’s  Baie-Comeau 
smelter represent about 105,000 metric tons of capacity and are
among Alcoa’s highest-cost to operate, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. Charges related to the
closing, to be completed by August, are expected to be 11 cents
to 13 cents a share, of which about 30 percent will be recorded
in the current quarter, Alcoa said.  The company has responded to falling prices and a supply
glut by paring costs at its least-efficient plants. Alcoa said
May 1 it’s evaluating about 11 percent, or 460,000 tons, of
annual smelting capacity for measures including curtailment or
closure by the end of next year. The restructuring announced
today is part of that review, it said.  Alcoa reduced smelting capacity by 13 percent in 2012 with
cutbacks in  Tennessee ,  Texas , Italy and Spain.  The Baie-Comeau smelter started up in 1957, Alcoa said on
its  website . The company had planned a $1.2 billion upgrade for
the plant, which has annual production capacity of 385,000
metric tons of aluminum.  Alcoa said today it will spend $100 million to modernize
the smelter, including $30 million to upgrade the plant’s
casthouse to form the metal for automotive customers.  Alcoa is expanding its engineered- and rolled-products
divisions, which sell aluminum and aluminum alloys to the
automotive, aerospace and energy industries. Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  is betting that record
backlogs at aircraft manufacturers replacing aging jets and
carmakers using more aluminum will shift Alcoa’s product mix to
higher-profit products.  Aluminum for delivery in three months fell 9.2 percent in
the 12 months through yesterday to $1,839.50 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
