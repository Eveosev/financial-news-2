The Republican-led U.S. House voted
to repeal President  Barack Obama ’s 2010 health-care law in a
symbolic gesture that has no chance of advancing in the Senate.  The near party-line 229-195 vote marks the 37th time the
House has voted to repeal or defund at least part of the law,
and the third time lawmakers voted to repeal the entire
Affordable Care Act.  To contact the reporter on this story:
