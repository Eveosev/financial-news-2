Japanese  stock futures  fell after
data showed U.S. jobless claims rose and housing starts slumped,
signaling a slowdown in the world’s biggest economy and damping
the earnings prospects for exporters. Australian stock futures
advanced.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Toyota Motor Corp (7203) , the
world’s largest carmaker, dropped 0.9 percent from the closing
share price in  Tokyo . Those of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., Japan’s biggest lender, declined 1.3 percent after the
stock yesterday slid the most in a month.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,
Australia’s biggest gold producer, may be active after gold
futures capped the longest slump since 2011.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 14,955 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 15,070
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 14,980 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index rose 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
slid 0.3 percent in Wellington.  “It’s not that the  U.S. economy  is improving fast, but
it’s rather getting traction slowly with a mixed bag of economic
data,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-based senior strategist
at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of $70 billion. “The market is due for profit
taking.”  U.S. Slowdown  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1

after jobless claims jumped by 32,000 to 360,000 last week, the

reported.  In Japan, machinery orders probably rose 3.5 percent in
March after gaining 7.5 percent in February, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of the
release of data at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 16 percent increase by the
 S&P 500  and a 10 percent rally by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Hong Kong markets are closed for a public holiday today.
