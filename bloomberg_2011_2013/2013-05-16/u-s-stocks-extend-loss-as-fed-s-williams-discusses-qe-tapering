U.S. stocks extended losses as
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams 
said the central bank may begin slowing the pace of its bond
purchases as early as this summer.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent to
1,651.64 at 3:26 p.m. in New York after drifting between gains
and losses for most of the day. The Dollar Index erased most of
its earlier decline while Treasuries remained higher.  Williams said the Fed  may slow the pace of its $85 billion
in monthly bond-buying amid signs the economy is gradually
gaining strength.  “It’s clear that the labor market has improved since
September” when the Fed began its third round of asset
purchases, Williams said today in the text of a speech in
 Portland , Oregon. “We could reduce somewhat the pace of our
securities purchases, perhaps as early as this summer” and end
the program late this year.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said May 1 that it’s
prepared to increase or decrease the size of its monthly bond-buying as officials gauge the health of the economy. The
 unemployment rate  fell to 7.5 percent in April, Labor Department
figures showed May 3.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
