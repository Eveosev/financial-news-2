Yes Bank Ltd. (YES) ,  India ’s best
performing bank share in the past year, jumped to a record after
saying that it plans to raise as much as $500 million selling
shares and global depository receipts.  The Mumbai-based lender plans to offer shares to large
investors and may sell receipts in  Europe , Rana Kapoor, chief
executive officer and managing director of the bank, said in a
telephone interview today. Yes Bank  jumped  2.8 percent to 542.55
rupees at the close in Mumbai.  Selling global depository receipts will give overseas
investors, who have been barred from buying the company’s shares
after their stake crossed the 49 percent limit, an opportunity
to invest in the company, Dolly Parmar, an analyst at IFCI
Financial Services Ltd., said by phone.  “Larger part of these funds will be raised by sale of
global depository receipts as it will give more headroom to
foreign investors,” Kapoor said. Yes Bank will seek
shareholders permission for its plans in June, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
