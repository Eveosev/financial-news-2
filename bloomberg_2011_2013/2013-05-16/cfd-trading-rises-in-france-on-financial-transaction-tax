The number of investors using
contracts for difference in  France , the first European country
to introduce a levy on financial transactions, has increased by
nearly a quarter in the last year, according to a report.  In the 12 months to February, 19,500 investors traded CFDs,
22 percent more than a year earlier, a release on May 14 from
 Investment Trends  showed. The report is based on a survey of
15,409 French investors conducted between January and March.  “This was predictable,” said Fabrice Seiman, co-chief
executive officer of Lutetia Capital in Paris, who trades CFDs
and helps manage and advise about $200 million. “It’s like what
happened in the U.K. after the introduction of stamp duty. It’s
logical. Stocks have been getting such bad press in the public
eye anyway so the transaction tax hasn’t helped.”  French President  Francois Hollande , who called finance his
“main adversary” during his election campaign, introduced a
0.2 percent transaction tax on share purchases in August. Many
investors have avoided the tax using CFDs, which allow them to
bet on a stock’s gain or loss without owning the shares.  The U.K., home to  Europe ’s biggest financial center,
charges stamp duty on equity transactions. The number of
investors using financial-spread betting and CFDs in the U.K. in
the 12 months through July 2012 climbed 4.5 percent to 92,000,
according to Investment Trends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
