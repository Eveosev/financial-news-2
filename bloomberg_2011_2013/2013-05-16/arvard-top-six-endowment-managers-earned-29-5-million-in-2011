Harvard University ’s six best-paid
endowment managers earned $29.5 million in 2011, a 45 percent
increase from the year before.  Harvard Management Co., which invests the university’s
endowment, paid Andrew Wiltshire, head of alternative assets,
$6.61 million for the calendar year, the most at the fund,
according to a statement from the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
college. Its six top-earning investment managers made $20.4
million in 2010.  In disclosing the managers’ compensation, which in the past
has spurred protest from some alumni as excessive, Harvard cited
the endowment’s returns.  “This compensation system is designed to closely align the
interests of the university with its investment professionals,”
James Rothenberg, university treasurer and Harvard Management’s
chairman, said today in the statement. Harvard’s “market-beating performance in the reporting period once again added
value to the resources upon which Harvard depends to fulfill its
teaching and research mission.”  Harvard’s endowment, the biggest in higher education, is
valued at $30.7 billion by the university. The total fell by
about $1 billion in the most recent fiscal year ended June 30
after gains of 11 percent and 21 percent in the two preceding
periods.  Long-Term Goals  Stephen Blyth, head of public markets for the management
company, was second-highest paid at $6.16 million, while Jane Mendillo, president and chief executive officer of Harvard
Management, was third at $5.32 million. Mendillo, who took over
after the financial crisis that began in 2008, has encouraged
setting longer-term investing goals.  Alvaro Aguirre-Simunovic, portfolio manager for natural
resources, earned $5.29 million; portfolio manager Apoorva
Koticha earned $3.11 million; and portfolio manager Marco Barrozo earned $2.99 million.  Harvard President Drew Faust was paid $899,734 for the
fiscal year that ended June 30, including about $129,000 for the
use of a home she’s required to live in by the terms of
employment, according to tax documents filed by the university.
Faust’s base compensation was $720,441 for the year, according
to the documents.  Harvard Management is based in  Boston .  To contact the reporter on this story:
