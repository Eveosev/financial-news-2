The Boston Marathon said it will
invite back the more than 5,000 runners who were unable to
complete the 2013 race because of the bombing at the finish line
that killed three people.  The Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the race,
made the announcement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
