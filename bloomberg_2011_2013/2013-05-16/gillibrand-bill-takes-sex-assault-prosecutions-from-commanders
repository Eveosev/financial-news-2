Senator Kirsten Gillibrand introduced
legislation with bipartisan backing that would remove from
military commanders the power to prosecute sexual assault and
other major crimes.  “Clearly our system is broken,” Gillibrand, a  New York 
Democrat, said today at a press conference where she was flanked
by senators and House members of both political parties. The
bill would let independent military prosecutors who are outside
the chain of command decide whether to take cases to a court-martial.  “This is the only way we can provide the unbiased justice
that our victims need,” Gillibrand said.  While Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel resisted the notion of
removing prosecution power from the chain of command at a news
conference last week, spokesman  George Little  said this week
that all options are under consideration to curb attacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
