U.K. lawmakers rejected suggestions
that the age of a child should be taken into account in sexual
abuse cases, as Britain debates historical abuse including those
of television star Jimmy Savile.  “The inclusion of age ranges could fail to take into
account a history of abuse of a child across the age boundaries,
could mean that distinctions are drawn unfairly and arbitrarily
between children who are, for example, 15 years and six months
and 16 years of age, or may fail to take account of the child’s
maturity,” Parliament’s Justice Committee said in a report
released in  London  today. “Where there is no statutory
distinction, we consider the creation of distinctions to be
unhelpful and confusing.”  The idea of age distinctions had been proposed in a meeting
last month between the Justice Committee and groups including
the Association of Chief Police Office, the  Crown Prosecution
Service , Rape Crisis and the Barnardo’s, a children’s charity.  Under  English law , the age of sexual consent is 16.
Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said March 6 that
 law enforcement  must change the way it investigates and
prosecutes sex crimes after Savile’s decades of abuse against
hundreds of victims went undetected until after his death.  A police investigation into historic abuses, codenamed
Operation Yewtree into Savile and others, has so far arrested 10
men.  To contact the reporter on this story:
