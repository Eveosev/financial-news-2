Joseph Grant, an Internal Revenue
Service manager who oversees tax-exempt organizations and
government entities, will retire June 3, according to an IRS
memo.  Grant had just been appointed to his position on May 8.  At the time, then-acting commissioner Steven Miller issued
a statement saying that Grant would “provide strong leadership
and continuity.”  Groups with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names
received tougher questioning and had longer delays than others
in a practice that the IRS acknowledged May 10.  Grant was previously the deputy commissioner over tax-exempt groups and government entities. Grant is a former member
of the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee,
according to the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
