Northeast Utilities (NU)  will get
Connecticut’s decision April 2 on its planned $4.63 billion
takeover of Nstar to create New England’s largest utility owner,
the state regulator said.  The deadline, announced in an e-mailed statement by the
Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, would come
two weeks before the current termination date of April 16 for
the takeover announced 15 months ago.  Northeast applied for Connecticut approval yesterday after
the authority, reversing two earlier decisions, declared it
would review the merger to protect customers in the state.
Northeast owns Connecticut Light & Power, the state’s largest
electric utility. NStar is based in  Boston . Northeast also needs
the approval of Massachusetts regulators to complete the
transaction.  The schedule outlined by the Connecticut regulator today
provides for hearings Feb. 14 through Feb. 17 and Feb. 27 and
Feb. 28. The authority said it plans to issue a draft decision
March 26, then take written and oral comments before issuing a
final decision April 2.  Northeast rose 2.5 percent to $34.36 at the close in  New
York .  Nstar (NST)  rose 2.5 percent to $44.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
