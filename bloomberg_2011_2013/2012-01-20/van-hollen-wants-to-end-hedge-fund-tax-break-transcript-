Representative  Chris Van Hollen 
of  Maryland , ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee,
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political
Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that Congress
should eliminate a tax break for private-equity and hedge-
fund executives to pay for extending a payroll tax cut for
workers.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

the House Budget Committee, Democratic Congressman Chris Van
Hollen of Maryland. Thank you for joining us, congressman.  REPRESENTATIVE CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Great to be with you,
Al.  HUNT: The president gives a State of the Union next
Tuesday. The White House has said, other than the  payroll
tax , they really don’t expect much to happen this year, so
this session really is all about politics.  VAN HOLLEN: Well, I wish I could say that we’d have a
more productive session this year, but given the history of
the House Republican leadership on so many of these issues,
it’s hard to say that would happen.  For example, the president has had his jobs package in
front of the House now since last September. And with the
exception of the payroll tax cut, or the two-month piece
that we already put in place, they haven’t taken any action
on that.  HUNT: Do you think the Republicans will wage a big
fight over that in February? Or they were burned in
December, will they just go through the motions?  VAN HOLLEN: I don’t know. It depends on what lessons
they learned or, more importantly, I guess, what the Tea
Party wing of the House  Republican Party  -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: What’s your sense now, though? You talk to them a
little bit.  VAN HOLLEN: Well, I know a lot of them have been on
record in the past not wanting to do a payroll tax cut,
which is always curious, since they’ve always been in favor
of tax cuts for the folks at the very top. But in any event,
the question is going to be whether they try and add all
these extraneous provisions, unrelated provisions, as they
did before.  HUNT: And you don’t have -  VAN HOLLEN: I don’t know yet. We have not had a
conference meeting. Our first conference will be held on
next Wednesday - Tuesday or Wednesday.  HUNT: There’s also the question of how to pay for it.
You’ve talked about higher levies on  bank transactions  and
oil and gas. How about carried interest that private equity
and hedge funds get? Pete Peterson,  Warren Buffett  all say
it’s indefensible, could raise some money. Would you be
willing to consider putting that in there, to change carried
interest on your income?  VAN HOLLEN: Not only would I consider it, I think that
we should, because if you look at a lot of the hedge fund
activities, these are people who are not putting their own
capital at risk. They’re not putting their own dollars in
the mix. They’re getting a special deal that’s not available
to other people in the economy. Obviously, it’s become an
issue in the presidential race.  HUNT: Could it become part of the payroll tax pay-for?  VAN HOLLEN: I think it should.  HUNT: It should?  VAN HOLLEN: Now, you know, I don’t know if our
Republican colleagues will go along. I believe it should be
part of it. I think it’s an inequity in the  tax code  and it
needs to be fixed.  HUNT: OK.  VAN HOLLEN: And just for clarification, it’s not a - I
wasn’t proposing a tax on bank transactions. This is the - a
fee on the big banks to recoup the TARP money that they
received. No, but there’s - it’s an important distinction,
that’s all.  HUNT: You’re absolutely right. You’re right. I
misstated it. A number of your colleagues in the House -
Democrats - say that this White House has been politically
tone-deaf when it comes to dealing with Democratic members
of Congress. There are increasing complaints. Is that a fair
criticism? And are they learning? Are they getting their act
together?  VAN HOLLEN: I don’t think it’s a fair criticism,
personally. I mean, I’ve heard it. I, in fact, think that
the White House has done a good job, especially in the last
four or five months, of communicating very clearly what
their position is, what they’re doing in following through.  HUNT: Congressman, what are the political implications
if the  Supreme Court  should throw out the Obama health care
measure?  VAN HOLLEN: Well, first, let me say what I think the
implications for the country would be. I mean, you’d have
about 30 million people who now would not get affordable
health insurance. You would also - if they threw out the
whole thing - throw out all the patient protections that
were part of the bill, making sure that people could stay on
their parent’s insurance until they’re age 26, making sure
that kids couldn’t be discriminated against based on pre-
existing conditions.  And I think that, if that were to happen, the Supreme
Court were to do that and you were to take it into the
election, there are a lot of people who have already begun
to benefit from some of the patient protection provisions in
the health care bill that all of a sudden would realize that
it - it meant more to them than they realized.  HUNT: So it would boomerang?  VAN HOLLEN: I think it would be terrible for the
country. I think politically - I don’t - I don’t think - I
know Republicans may think they would benefit somehow from
that politically. I don’t believe that’s the case. In fact,
I think -  HUNT: And Democrats even can benefit politically, even
though you don’t want it to happen?  VAN HOLLEN: Well, I think Democrats would - would point
out the good things that were in the bill, the patient
protection provisions, the fact that it actually helps close
the donut hole for Medicare prescription drugs. I mean, if
they really threw the whole thing out wholesale, a lot of
Americans are going to stand to lose a lot in terms of their
health care protection and coverage, especially the people
who will get more affordable care when it fully kicks in.  HUNT: Let’s take a look at national politics. From the
vantage point of a Democrat, who do you hope the Republicans
nominate? Who would be the easier to beat or who would be
the toughest to beat? Ask it the other way.  Mitt Romney  or
 Newt Gingrich ?  VAN HOLLEN: Well, Al, one thing I’ve learned, not
surprising, is don’t wade into Republican politics, because
the guy that you think you may be advantaging or harming by
your comments, the other guys can use -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: OK, assess them, then. Let me ask you to assess
them as potential nominees.  VAN HOLLEN: Well, look, I mean, obviously, Romney is
the current frontrunner in the Republican race, but he has
huge vulnerabilities. And his major vulnerabilities is the
sense that he’s just out of touch. And we’ve heard about the
whole issue with  Bain Capital , and he made a big mistake
trying to argue he was a job-creator. What he was, was a guy
who tried to maximize return for his investors, mostly very
wealthy investors. That’s fine; that’s what he’s supposed to
do.  But by trying to argue that he was, in fact, this big
jobs creator, you then have all these stories about how they
went into some of these ventures, essentially, you know,
cleaned out some of the pension funds, they took a big
return in many cases, and then you have the further point
where his  tax policy , when it comes to  capital gains , is
something that would give him, Mitt Romney, an additional
huge tax break.  HUNT: So that’s his problem. How about Newt Gingrich?  VAN HOLLEN: Well, Newt, obviously, has all sorts of
issues that his own colleagues have raised. You know,  Rick
Santorum  pointed out that Newt has sort of taken every
different position on the map. Obviously, he has a
particular issue with respect to social conservatives, but
it doesn’t appear to have made a difference so far in  South
Carolina .  But, look, Newt has obviously been an unsteady hand. I
think Rick Santorum raised the right question, which is, you
know, you don’t know what he’s going to say two hours from
now.  HUNT: Democrats complained bitterly when the
Republicans tried to impeach  Bill Clinton  over allegations
of sexual misconduct. Is it unfair that Newt Gingrich then
is facing some of the same criticism now?  VAN HOLLEN: Well, the issue with Newt Gingrich has
been, in many ways, the difference between what he says and
what he does. I mean, it’s a hypocrisy issue. I mean, what
you have in Newt Gingrich is somebody who was impeaching
Bill Clinton, but at the same time, obviously, had all these
issues going on in his personal life. Look, I’m going to
leave that -  HUNT: Having an affair while he was speaker of the
House. That’s a - that’s a -  VAN HOLLEN: While he - while he was speaker of the
House and while he was engaged in impeachment proceedings
against the president based on the president’s associations.
In any event, these are obviously all issues for the voters
to judge, but I think the big issue in this election is
going to be who’s best for jobs and the economy and who’s
most in touch with, you know, the American people.  HUNT: OK, for  Barack Obama  to win, what does the
 unemployment rate  have to be in November?  VAN HOLLEN: Well, I think people have to have a sense
that things are improving. I don’t think the specific number
is as important with the -  HUNT: But it has to be coming down?  VAN HOLLEN: - with the direction the country feels it’s
going in, in terms of the economy.  HUNT: Chris Van Hollen, thank you so much for being
with us today.  VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.  HUNT: And when we come back, all eyes on South
Carolina. Bloomberg reporters join us from Charleston.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
