Japan  said  North Korea  released two
Japanese citizens arrested last year, in what may signal a thaw
in relations under new leader Kim Jong Un.  The two men, who were detained last March, returned to
Japan this week, Jin Matsubara, head of the National Public
Safety Commission, told reporters today in Tokyo. North Korea
said in May that Hidehiko Abe and Takumi Hirooka were taken into
custody on charges of violating the totalitarian state’s drug
and counterfeiting laws.  “This may mark a change under the new regime,” Matsubara
said. Kim Jong Un became North Korea’s leader in December after
the death of his father, Kim Jong Il.  Japan is part of stalled six-nation negotiations aimed at
persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
The Japanese government is also seeking information on Japanese
nationals abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.  Foreign Minister  Koichiro Gemba , who said two days ago that
the new North Korean regime poses risks and opportunities, said
earlier today that Japan had asked the government in Pyongyang
to release the two men on humanitarian grounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
