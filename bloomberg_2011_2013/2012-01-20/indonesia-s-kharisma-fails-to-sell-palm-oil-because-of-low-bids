PT Kharisma Pemasaran Bersama
Nusantara , which sells  palm oil  from  Indonesia ’s state-owned
plantations, withdrew 10,250 metric tons of the edible commodity
due to low bids in an auction.  The company received the highest bid from PT Hidreen Palm
International at 8,470 rupiah a kilogram ($947 a ton) for
shipments from Dumai port in Riau province, less than the target
price of 8,509 rupiah, Kharisma said in a faxed statement today.  Jakarta-based Kharisma sold 2,500 tons of palm oil in an
auction yesterday at highest price of 8,573 rupiah a kilogram
for Belawan and Dumai ports. Indonesia is the world’s largest
producer of palm oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
