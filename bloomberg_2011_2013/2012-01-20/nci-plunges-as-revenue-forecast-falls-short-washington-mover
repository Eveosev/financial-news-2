NCI Inc. (NCIT) , a technology contractor to
the federal government, fell as much as 33 percent in  New York 
for the biggest intraday drop since August after forecasting
revenue that trailed analysts’ estimates.  The scope of some orders has been reduced and a “high
number” of contract awards are under protest, the Reston,
Virginia-based company said in a statement yesterday. Sales will
total $340 million to $360 million in 2012, missing the $510.8
million average estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “An unfavorable competitive environment, pricing pressures
and delayed or canceled procurements” contributed to the
shortfall, President Brian J. Clark said in the statement.  NCI also expects restructuring costs of 11 cents to 14
cents a share from 2011 for job cuts and ending or renegotiating
leases on buildings. About 60 indirect NCI employees or
consultants are being cut, the company said.  The stock dropped 29 percent to $8.10 at 10:14 a.m. on the
Nasdaq Stock Market and earlier plunged as low as $7.70. The
shares lost almost half their value last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
