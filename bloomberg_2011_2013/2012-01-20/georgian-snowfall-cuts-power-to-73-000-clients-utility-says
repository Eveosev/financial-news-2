Heavy snowfall in three Georgian
regions has blocked access and cut off power to about 8 percent
of power generator  AO Energo-Pro Georgia ’s clients.  “Right now, 73,000 customers are without power and we
can’t get to damaged  power lines  due to persistent snowfall,”
Avto Dvalishvili, a spokesman for the company, said by phone
today from the capital, Tbilisi. Emergency repairs will be
carried out shortly, he added.  Lines are down in villages in the mountainous Adjara region
near the  Black Sea , as well as Samegrelo and Guria, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
