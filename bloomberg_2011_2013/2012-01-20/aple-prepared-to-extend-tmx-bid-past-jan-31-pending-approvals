Maple Group Acquisition Corp.,
comprised of 13 Canadian financial-services firms, will extend
its C$3.73 billion ($3.69 billion) offer for  TMX Group Inc. (X)  past
a Jan. 31 deadline if it hasn’t received regulatory approvals to
buy  Canada ’s main equities and derivatives markets.  The Oct. 30 agreement between Maple and TMX says that if
conditions aren’t satisfied by the offer expiry date, “Maple
shall be required to extend the expiry time.” The tender offer
to buy at least 70 percent of TMX shares can be extended up to
April 30, according to the agreement.  “It’s clear that if all of the approvals haven’t been
approved by Jan. 31, the offer will be extended,” Maple
spokesman  Peter Block  said today in a telephone interview.
“We’re in discussions with all the regulators to get the
necessary approvals on the transaction.”  Maple, whose members include  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Ontario
Teachers’ Pension Plan  and  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , has
extended its offer three times since proposing to buy the
Toronto Stock Exchange owner in May. Maple intends to buy 100
percent of TMX and integrate it with Canada’s securities
clearinghouse and Alpha Group, a bank-owned alternative trading
venue that competes with TMX.  The plan requires approval from provincial regulators and
Canada’s Competition Bureau, which said Nov. 29 that it has
“serious concerns” about the plan.  Maple will update investors on the transaction by the end
of the month, Block said. TMX spokeswoman Carolyn Quick declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
