JPMorgan Chase & Co.  left Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon ’s pay package for 2011 almost
unchanged at about $23 million after trimming stock and options
awards, according to a person with knowledge of the decision.  JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, paid
Dimon $17.3 million in restricted stock and options for 2011,
down from $17.4 million for 2010, including 337,032 restricted
shares valued at about $12.3 million, according to  regulatory
filings  today by the New York-based company. The package awarded
562,430 options valued by the firm at about $5 million,
according to the person, who asked for anonymity because
compensation matters are confidential.  Dimon, 55, led JPMorgan through the financial crisis
without recording a single losing quarter and surpassed  Bank of
America Corp.  last year as the largest U.S. lender. Net income
advanced 9 percent to a record $19 billion in 2011, while the
stock dropped 20 percent including dividends.  Total compensation for the year is expected to be about the
same as 2010, the person said. Dimon may also receive a cash
bonus for 2011 that hasn’t yet been disclosed.  The exact total of his stock payout may differ and will be
disclosed when the company files its proxy statement later this
year. Dimon’s restricted stock may be worth as little as $12
million based on the average price of $35.61 on Jan. 18,
according to the person.  A $500,000 Raise  The  board  raised his annual base pay for 2011 in March to
$1.5 million from $1 million. Dimon also received options
proceeds on Jan. 19 of $195,869 and sold $4 million in shares on
Jan. 13 as part of a regularly scheduled sale to cover taxes on
restricted stock.  Dimon took the $1 million salary and gave up bonuses for
2008 -- the year when the financial crisis nearly toppled the
banking system -- after receiving $49.9 million in total
compensation for 2007, which included cash and restricted stock
bonuses of $14.5 million each.  Dimon was paid $15.2 million for his work in 2009,
according to the bank’s calculations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
