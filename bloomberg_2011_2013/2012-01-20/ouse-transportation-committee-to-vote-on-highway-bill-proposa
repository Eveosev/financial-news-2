The U.S. House Transportation
Committee may vote on its version of legislation to reauthorize
surface-transportation programs on Feb. 2, according to three
people familiar with the matter.  The committee also won a commitment from House leaders for
the full House to debate the bill in February. Transportation
industry officials will be briefed on Jan. 26, the people said.  U.S. surface transportation programs have operated under
periodic extensions of the legislation that was set to expire in
2009, with the current authorization ending on March 31. A
Senate version of the measure was approved by the Environment
and Public Works Committee in November.  Both bills would need to find additional funding to prevent
cuts in highway, bridge and transit projects, the committees
have said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
