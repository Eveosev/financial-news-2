Textiles, the biggest cotton company in  Burkina Faso , got a loan
of 77 billion  CFA francs  ($151 million) to finance crop
purchases in the 2011-2012 harvest, said Chief Executive Officer
Jean Paul Sawadogo.  The credit from 10 local lenders will allow for “the rapid
payment of producers,” he said today after signing the deal in
Ouagadougou, the capital. It’s an increase of 7 percent over the
previous season’s loan, according to Roger Dah-Achinanon,
managing director of  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) ’s Burkinabe
unit, one of the banks that took part in the facility.  Burkina Faso, which vies with neigboring Mali as  Africa ’s
biggest cotton producer, said in April it would pay farmers 245
francs for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of the fiber.  Sofitex, as the company is known, starting buying cotton
last month. The company’s cotton-seed production will rise 5
percent to 300,000 metric tons in the 2011-2012 harvest,
Sawadogo said.  Sofitex has repaid about 75 percent of last season’s loan,
said Dah-Achinanon.  United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) ’s Banque
Internationale du Burkina, Societe Generale SA’s unit,  Bank of
Africa Burkina Faso , Groupe Banque Atlantique, Coris Bank
International and Banque Sahelo Saharienne pour l’Investissement
et le Commerce are among the lenders taking part, he said.  The company will sign a loan deal with international banks
on Jan. 27 in Paris, said Helene Traore, spokeswoman for
