Copper traders are the least bearish
in a month as the metal has its best start to a year since 2009
and stockpiles tracked by the world’s biggest metals exchange
were poised to slump to the lowest in 2 1/2 years.  Fourteen of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the
metal to decline next week, the lowest proportion since Dec. 23.
Three were neutral. Prices reached a four-month high of
$8,428.50 a metric ton today, taking this year’s advance to 11
percent.  Inventories (LSCA)  tracked by the  London  Metal Exchange are
already the smallest since December 2010 and existing orders to
withdraw metal may reduce that to the lowest since July 2009.  China, which consumes 40 percent of the world’s copper,
expanded 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter, the slowest pace in
10 quarters. That increased speculation the government will
stimulate lending to shore up the economy. While global growth
is slowing, demand is still exceeding supply from mines. The
shortages will reach 363,000 tons this year, enough to meet more
than a month of European demand,  Barclays Capital  estimates.  “Physical metal has been tightening,” said Angus Staines,
an analyst at UBS AG in London. “Demand consumption will still
grow and that’s largely driven by  China .”  Copper is rebounding from a 21 percent plunge in 2011, the
first decline since 2008. Its rally this year beat the 1.3
percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Index (MXWD)  of 24
commodities and the 4.6 percent advance in the MSCI All-Country
World  Index (MXWD)  of equities. Treasuries are down 0.3 percent, a Bank
of America Corp. index shows. Copper fell 1.6 percent today to
$8,230.25 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, bringing this
year’s gain to 8.3 percent, the best start to a year since 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese Growth  China’s fourth-quarter growth, announced by the national
statistics bureau Jan. 17, exceeded the 8.7 percent anticipated
by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. U.S. factory output climbed
0.9 percent last month, the most in a year, Federal Reserve data
showed the following day. The U.S. is the biggest buyer of
copper after China.  Stockpiles monitored by the LME slid 27 percent since
October to 348,750 tons, with Asian inventories plunging 82
percent in the period. Combined stockpiles tracked by bourses in
London, New York and  Shanghai  tumbled 16 percent over the same
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It looks as if the copper market is in deficit,” said
 John Meyer , an analyst at Fairfax IS in London. “U.S. economic
figures are looking better and there’s talk of China doing a
soft landing.”  Money Managers  Speculators are paring bets on lower prices.  Hedge funds 
and other money managers had a net-short position of 2,465 U.S.
futures and options in the week ended Jan. 10, compared with
9,489 contracts three months ago. They’ve held a  net-short 
position since mid-September, the longest stretch since July
2009, a month after the last U.S. recession ended.  The World Bank cut its global growth forecast by the most
in three years on Jan. 18, saying that a recession in the euro
region threatens emerging markets. The institution’s forecast
for 2012 growth of 2.5 percent was down from June’s estimate of
3.6 percent and compares with a 2.7 percent expansion in 2011.  “You only have to look at the  World Bank  downward
revisions to world growth to see that all is not well in the
global economy,” said  William Adams , a London-based analyst at
Basemetals.com, a data and information provider. Copper prices
may be “running ahead of themselves,” he said.  The metal’s 14-day relative-strength index yesterday rose
above 70, a level that indicates to some analysts who study
technical charts that a drop in prices may be imminent.  China’s Exports  Copper usage in Europe slipped 1 percent in 2011 and will
decline 2 percent this year, according to Barclays. Weaker
consumption in Europe may hurt demand for imported goods.
Chinese exports rose 13.4 percent in December from a year
earlier, the slowest pace since February, customs data show.  Nine of 20 traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expect gold to gain next week and four were neutral. Futures on
the Comex in  New York  rose 6.2 percent to $1,664.20 an ounce
this month after last year’s 10 percent increase.  Holdings in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  at
2,355.48 tons are within 2 percent of the record set last month.
Metal in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest ETP backed by bullion,
rose 0.1 percent on Jan. 17, the first gain since Nov. 30.  Nine of 14 people surveyed expect raw-sugar prices to climb
next week. The commodity slid 27 percent last year and is up 6.3
percent this month at 24.76 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Traders are betting that the biggest sugar glut since
2007 will shrink in the next harvest, with the March 2013
contract now trading at a premium to the July 2012 contract. Six
months ago it was at a discount.  Corn Survey  Fourteen of 27 people surveyed anticipate higher corn
prices next week, while 15 of 28 said soybeans will advance.
Corn dropped 6.4 percent this month to $6.05 a bushel after
increasing 2.8 percent in 2011. Soybeans are down 1.8 percent in
January at $11.8575 a bushel after sliding 14 percent last year.  “It looks like the U.S. is getting better rather than
worse, and  Europe  is troughing out,” said Ric Deverell, head of
global commodities research at Credit Suisse Group AG in London.
“Eight percent to 9 percent growth in China is still making a
very large contribution to global commodity consumption.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
