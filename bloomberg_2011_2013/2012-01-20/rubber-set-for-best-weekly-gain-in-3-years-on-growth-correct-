(Corrects Thai baht conversion in fifth paragraph.)  Rubber climbed, heading for the best
weekly gain in three years, amid optimism about economic growth
after U.S. jobless claims dropped to the lowest level in almost
four years and Spanish and French borrowing costs fell.  June-delivery rubber climbed as much as 2.6 percent to 313
yen a kilogram ($4,060 a metric ton), the highest level since
Oct. 31, before trading at 312.7 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange at 12:20 p.m. The most-active contract has gained 13
percent this week, the most since the week ended Dec. 19, 2008.  Asian stocks extended a global rally after a report showed
U.S. initial jobless claims dropped by 50,000 to 352,000. Spain
and  France  sold bonds at lower yields, boosting optimism the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis is being contained.  “Concerns about the European crisis are easing, spurring
investor purchases of riskier assets,” Takaki Shigemoto, an
analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said today by
phone. “Rubber also drew support from expectations for  China ’s
monetary easing and  Thailand ’s price-support plan.”  Thailand’s government plans to spend 17 billion baht ($539
million) to buy rubber at above-market rates to boost the
domestic price to 120 baht a kilogram, Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said Jan. 17. Chinese bank
lending in the first quarter may rise from a year earlier, the
Shanghai Securities News reported today.  Thai rubber prices slumped 29 percent last year as the
European crisis deepened concerns the global recovery may stall,
weakening demand for the commodity used in tires. “The
appropriate and sustainable level” for rubber is at 120 baht a
kilogram, Agriculture Minister Theera Wongsamut said this week.  May-delivery rubber gained 2.6 percent to 27,650 yuan
($4,378) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. The Thai cash
price jumped 2.9 percent to 118.05 baht a kilogram yesterday,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
