At least 110 people were injured in
 Iran  when an earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale
struck the northeastern city of Neyshabur yesterday, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported, without citing anyone.  The quake hit at 4:05 pm local time,  IRNA  reported. There
were no reports of any deaths, and about 18 people who suffered
broken bones were taken to the hospital, it said.  About 75 aftershocks were recorded,  IRNA  said today. Iran
sits on several  fault lines  and is frequently hit by
earthquakes.  Iranâ€™s deadliest quake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale,
struck the southeast in 2003, leaving 31,000 dead, according to
the  U.S. Geological Survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
