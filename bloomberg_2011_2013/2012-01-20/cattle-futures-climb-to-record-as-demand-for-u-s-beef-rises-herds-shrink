Hog prices dropped to a one-week low
on signs of increasing supplies of pork and slowing demand.
Cattle futures fell from a record.  Warehouses in the U.S. held 481.7 million pounds of pork,
up 1.2 percent from  475.8 million  on Dec. 31, 2010, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said in a  report  released after the
close of regular trading. Pork output in 2011 rose 1.4 percent
to 22.8 billion pounds, the USDA said today in a separate
 report . On Jan. 18, wholesale  pork  prices rose to 85.33 cents, a
two-week high, USDA data show.  “No one wants to own more inventory than they can move
quickly,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson
Group, said in a telephone interview from  Yates City ,  Illinois .
“At these kind of price levels, you don’t want to be on the
wrong side of your inventory. Retailers are coming in and buying
what they think they can comfortably move and then saying ‘I’m
done.’”  Hog futures for April settlement declined 0.5 percent to
settle at 87.05 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange after reaching 87 cents, the lowest for a 
most-active contract since Jan. 13.  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.1 percent to close
at $1.27725 a pound, after reaching $1.29325, the highest for a
most-active contract since the commodity began trading on the
CME in 1964. Prices are up 5.2 percent in January, heading for
the biggest monthly gain since September.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement dropped 0.1
percent to close at $1.5385 a pound on the CME. Earlier, the
price reached a record $1.55275.  Feedlots buy year-old animals that weigh 500 pounds (227
kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle are
fattened on corn for about four to five months until they weigh
about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
