Romal Shetty, executive director of
 KPMG ’s Indian unit, comments after  India ’s Supreme Court today
ruled that Vodafone Group Plc isn’t liable to pay tax on its
2007 acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.’s wireless operations
in the South Asian country. He spoke in an interview with
Bloomberg UTV today.  “This allows Vodafone to focus more on the Indian
operations, focus more on getting more subscribers, being more
profitable rather than fighting on the tax side of it.  ‘‘It’s a shot in the arm. It’s a boost for Vodafone
definitely, but even from an industry perspective it’s a
boost.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
