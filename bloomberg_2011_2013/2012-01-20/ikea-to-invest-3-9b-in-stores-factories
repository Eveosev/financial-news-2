Ikea Group, the world’s largest
furniture retailer, plans to spend 3 billion euros
($3.9 billion) on expansion in the coming year as it seeks
to build on a decade of unbroken growth in revenue.  The Swedish company will add stores, factories and retail
centers, and expand its wind farms and solar power sources, it
said today in a  statement . Last year, Ikea invested 1.4 billion
euros in stores and 300 million euros in the industrial group,
and spent 40 million euros on solar panels and renewable energy.  Sales at Ikea have risen every year since 2001, and climbed
6.9 percent to 25.2 billion euros in the financial year ended
Aug. 31. The strongest growth last year was in  Russia ,  China  and
 Poland . Chief Executive Officer Mikael Ohlsson said in September
that Ikea will triple the pace of openings in China, reducing
its reliance on  Europe , where it gets 79 percent of sales in a
region that is suffering from a slump in  consumer confidence .  “We’re fortunate to have the resources to safely navigate
uncertain economic climates,” Vice President Soren Hansen said
in the statement. “We’ve been able to continue investing in
existing stores, new stores and in our supply chain.”  The retailer said the value of its cash and securities
declined “slightly” in the last financial year to 16.8 billion
euros. Net income rose 10 percent to 2.97 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
