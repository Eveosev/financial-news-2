Philippine 10-year bonds gained,
with yields falling by the most in a week, after the central
bank said it may consider more rate cuts should economic growth
slow. The peso strengthened.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas lowered its overnight borrowing
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent
yesterday, its first reduction since 2009. Policy makers will
consider the fourth-quarter growth figure at the next policy
meeting in March, Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said yesterday.
Inflation eased to an 11-month low of 4.2 percent in December,
official data show.  Bonds “will remain well-supported given the central bank’s
comments,” said Angeline Sia, a fixed-income trader who helps
manage the equivalent of $15 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc.
in  Manila . “The government’s focus is on propping up the
economy given inflation remains well controlled.”  The yield on the 6.375 percent bond due January 2022 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.18 percent, as
of 11:25 a.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial
Services. The rate rose four basis points this week.  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 43.285 per dollar,
