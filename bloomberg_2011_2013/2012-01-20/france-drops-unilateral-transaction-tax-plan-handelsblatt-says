France  has dropped plans to impose a
financial transaction tax on its own and instead favors only
applying a stock transfer tax,  Handelsblatt  reports today,
citing an unidentified official at a large French bank.  The French  finance ministry  held talks in recent days with
banks, which threatened to move much of their business to  London 
if a tax was imposed, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
