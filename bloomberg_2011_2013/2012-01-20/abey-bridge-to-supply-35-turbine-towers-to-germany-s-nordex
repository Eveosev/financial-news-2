Mabey Bridge Ltd ., a Welsh maker of
towers for  wind turbines , won its biggest order from  Germany ’s
 Nordex SE (NDX1)  for 35 of the steel structures.  Mabey Bridge, based in Monmouthshire, will begin producing
the towers under a “multimillion-pound” contract with the
Hamburg-based turbine-maker in February, the company said today
in an e-mailed statement. Other terms weren’t disclosed.  “In a week where our installed wind capacity has passed
the 6-gigawatt mark, this is yet more evidence that the U.K. is
a leading place to do business in renewable energy,” Energy
Minister  Charles Hendry  said in a statement. The U.K. needs
about 31 gigawatts of wind capacity to meet its target of
getting 15 percent of energy from low-carbon sources by 2020,
according to the government’s  Renewables Roadmap .  Mabey Bridge said 14 of the towers, each weighing 120
metric tons, will be installed at the Pant-Y-Wal wind farm near
Rhondda in South Wales developed by Pennant Walters Ltd.  The rest of the structures, measuring as long as 70 meters
(230 feet), are for the Baillie wind park on the north coast of
 Scotland  owned by Statkraft AS, the Norwegian renewable-energy
company, and local wind energy developers, according to the
statement. Installations at both sites will begin in June.  The U.K. has enough installed wind turbines to power more
than 3.3 million homes, according to RenewableUK, a London-based
industry group.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
