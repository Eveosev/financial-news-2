Greece ’s Energy Ministry may suspend
the licenses of Energa and Hellas Power, the country’s two
leading private electricity retailers, because of unpaid debts,
 Kathimerini  reported.  The two companies owe more than 200 million euros
($259 million) to the Hellenic Transmission System Operator SA
and to  Public Power Corp. SA (PPC) , the state-run electricity
provider, the  Athens  based newspaper reported, citing a meeting
of the three parties.  -- Editor: Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
