Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to near a one-month low, after
lower-than-forecast retail sales prompted investors to pare bets
on interest-rate increases.  The yield on the nation’s 9.25 percent bonds due in May
2014 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.11
percent, according to the stock exchange. The yield fell to 6.09
percent on Jan. 18, its lowest level on a closing basis since
Dec. 16. The bond’s price rose 0.033 centavo to 106.533 centavos
per peso.  A government report released after the markets closed
yesterday showed Colombia’s retail sales rose 1.3 percent in
November from the year-earlier period, lower than the 5.9
percent median estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Some may be taking the data as an additional argument for
the central bank to remain on hold for longer,” said Daniel Velandia, head of research at Bogota-based brokerage Correval
SA.  Banco de la Republica increased the overnight lending rate
25 basis points in November to 4.75 percent, citing “very
dynamic” internal demand, loan growth and record housing costs.
Policy makers left the rate unchanged at their Dec. 16 meeting
and are slated to next meet on Jan. 30.  The lower-than-forecast retail sales figure was mostly
attributable to a contraction in auto sales following a jump
last year that was prompted by discounts and other promotions,
Velandia said. The central bank will probably raise the key rate
a quarter percentage point to 5 percent in February and to 5.5
percent by year-end, he estimates.  Peso Advances  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 1,823.90 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,825.86 yesterday. It advanced 0.9 percent this week and has
strengthened 6.3 percent in 2012, the best performance among all
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  BNP Paribas SA recommended today that investors bet
Colombia’s currency will weaken against the  Mexican peso  because
Colombia’s central bank may seek to limit gains.  The Colombian peso’s “outperformance in  Latin America  so
far in 2012 is not expected to last as there is the
possibility” that the central bank intervenes in the currency
market, BNP Paribas analysts wrote in the report. “The Mexican
peso was the currency to suffer the most in late 2011, and it is
likely to be the one to improve the most in the case of
normalization.”  In September, Colombia’s central bank ended a one-year
program of purchasing a minimum of $20 million daily in the
 currency market  aimed at stemming gains in the peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
