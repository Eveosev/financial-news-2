It’s impossible to know how many
tens of thousands of European women were killed as witches, but
it was clearly a growth industry. During the 17th century,
Puritan Matthew Hopkins set himself up as “Witchfinder
General,” moving from town to town throughout Britain, zeroing
in on possible suspects.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Elizabeth Clarke was his first victim, accused by a local
fortune-teller of using evil powers to make the tailor’s wife
ill.  After three days of sleep deprivation and forced walking,
Clarke confessed to “carnall copulation” with the Devil, and
implicated other women. Hopkins gave evidence himself,
testifying that one of Satan’s imps -- disguised as an animal --
had attacked his greyhound. Clarke and the others were sentenced
to death by hanging.  Hopkins was paid 20 shillings per conviction, equivalent to
a month’s wages for a laborer or foot soldier. On one
exceptionally profitable day, he had 19 witches hanged. By the
time he died in 1647, during a period of deprivation for most
people, Hopkins had put together a tidy little fortune.  I spoke with Charlie Campbell, author of “Scapegoat: A
History of Blaming Other People,” on the following topics:  1. Disaster Explained  2. Meting Out Punishment  3. Witch Hunts  4. Whipping Boys  5. Holocaust  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
