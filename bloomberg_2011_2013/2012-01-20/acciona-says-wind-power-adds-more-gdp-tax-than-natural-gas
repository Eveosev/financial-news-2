Acciona (ANA)  Energia Chairwoman Carmen
Becerril said wind power is a bigger boost to the economy and
generates more tax revenue than electricity from natural gas-
fired generators.  Wind power costs about 80 euros ($103) per megawatt-hour
and adds about 56 euros to gross domestic product while power
from combined-cycle plants costs about 60 euros and adds about
17 euros, Becerril said at a conference in Madrid today, citing
a study commissioned by the company. Wind power generates about
33 euro cents of tax revenue for each euro spent in  Spain 
compared with 13 euro cents for gas plants.  “It’s pretty clear that wind power is better in terms of
wealth creation,  job creation  and also  tax revenue  generated,”
Becerril told reporters. “Any fossil fuel plant has to start
off by buying its fuel from another economy.”  Wind farm developers in Spain are lobbying the government
to set out regulations and extend aid for new farms from 2013
as the existing rules expire this year. Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria says his priority is to tackle the imbalance
between revenue and costs, including generation, transmission
and renewable energy subsidies, that have created debts of more
than 20 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
