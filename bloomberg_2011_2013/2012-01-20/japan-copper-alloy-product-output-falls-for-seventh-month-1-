Japan â€™s output of copper and copper-
alloy fabricated products, including sheets and tubes, slumped
12.1 percent in December from a year ago, falling for a seventh
month as demand for exports slowed, an industry group said.  Production was 60,530 metric tons last month, compared with
68,859 tons a year ago, the Japan Copper & Brass  Association 
said today, citing preliminary data. Output totaled 65,996 tons
in November, down 10.3 percent from 73,612 tons a year ago.  Output fell 4.9 percent to 824,500 tons in calendar 2011
from a year earlier, the association said in a statement. In
December, production for domestic consumption declined 8.2
percent to 52,038 tons, while output for exports plunged 30.3
percent to 8,492 tons, it said.  Copper for three-month delivery gained as much as 0.8
percent to $8,428.50 per ton, the highest level since Sept. 20,
