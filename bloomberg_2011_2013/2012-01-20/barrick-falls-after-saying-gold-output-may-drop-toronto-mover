Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the biggest
producer of the metal, erased gains after the company said gold
production may fall this year.  Barrick fell 1 percent to close at C$46.52 in Toronto. The
Toronto-based company earlier traded as high as C$47.65.  Gold output will probably be “slightly” lower and
production costs will be about 15 percent higher year-on-year,
Chief Financial Officer Jamie Sokalsky said in a presentation at
a conference in Whistler, British Columbia. His remarks were
broadcast over the Internet.  Barrick still expects to increase gold production to 9
million ounces annually in five years, Sokalsky said. The
company said on Oct. 27 that 2012 cash costs would probably be
about 10 percent higher. Gold production was expected to be
“comparable” to 2011, it said at the time.  “I’m not so fussed if production is going to be basically
flat this year,” Kerry Smith, a Toronto-based analyst at
Haywood Securities Inc., said in a telephone interview. New
mines it’s building in the  Dominican Republic ,  Chile  and
 Argentina  will boost production when they start up, he said.  Copper production will be higher because of the
contribution from assets acquired in Barrick’s C$7.5 billion
($7.39 billion) takeover of Equinox Minerals Ltd.  Barrick will provide more details when it releases year-end
results on Feb. 16, Sokalsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
