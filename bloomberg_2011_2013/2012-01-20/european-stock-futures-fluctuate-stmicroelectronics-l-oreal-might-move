     Jan. 20 (Bloomberg) --  European stocks  retreated from a
five-month high as U.S. home sales rose less than forecast,
adding to concern that gains in equities have outpaced the
outlook for economic growth.  Cie. de Saint-Gobain, Europe’s largest building-materials
supplier, led construction shares lower, falling 2 percent. BP
Plc paced losses in oil and gas shares.  National Bank of Greece
SA (ETE)  rose for an eighth day as talks between Greek officials and
private creditors entered a third day.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  slipped 0.3 percent to
255.85 at the close of trading, having earlier fallen as much as
0.6 percent. The gauge has still advanced 4.6 percent in 2012,
the best start to a year since 1997, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Most indexes have already risen as much as they were
expected to for the whole year, so naturally investors are
getting a bit cautious,” said Witold Bahrke, a senior
strategist at PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen, which manages $45
billion. “Politicians are digging in to do the dirty work,
which will create some turbulence in the week to come.”  The Stoxx 600 rose 2.7 percent  this week , a fifth straight
advance, amid signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering,  Europe  will
contain its debt crisis and speculation that  China  will ease
lending curbs to spur economic growth.  National benchmark indexes fell in 12 of the 18 western
European markets today.  France ’s  CAC 40 , the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and
 Germany ’s DAX Index all slid 0.2 percent.  Greece ’s ASE rallied
2.7 percent to a two-month high.  Greek Talks  Greek officials and private creditors met for a third day
to seek agreement on a debt swap. European officials and
bondholders agreed in October to implement a 50 percent cut in
the face value of Greek debt by voluntarily exchanging
outstanding bonds for new securities, with a goal of reducing
borrowings to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020.  The government and creditors reached an initial agreement
for a voluntary swap of Greek debt, Proto Thema reported on its
website, without saying how it got the information. The parties
agreed that new bonds to replace existing Greek debt would be of
a 30-year maturity and carry a coupon beginning at 3.1 percent,
reach 3.9 percent and go as high as 4.75 percent, the Athens-
based newspaper said.  “It’s possible we’ll have something to say later
tonight,”  Charles Dallara , managing director of the
International Institute of Finance, said in Athens today after
meeting with Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos . He declined to
comment further.  ‘Overbought’ Shares  The Stoxx 600 became “overbought” for the first time in
14 months yesterday, as the 14-day  Relative Strength Index (SXXP) ,
which tracks momentum by comparing closing prices with daily
trading ranges, rose to 70.47. When the RSI climbs above 70,
some technical analysts say the underlying security is likely to
fall.  Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose increased 5
percent to a 4.61 million annual rate in December, the National
Association of Realtors said today. The pace was less than the
4.65 million median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  Saint-Gobain slid 2 percent to 33.89 euros as a gauge of
construction companies in the Stoxx 600 dropped the most in two
weeks.  Assa Abloy AB (ASSAB) , the world’s largest lockmaker, retreated
3.8 percent to 180.60 kronor in  Stockholm .  BP Drops  BP, the U.K.’s second-largest oil company, dropped 3.1
percent to 467.45 pence as crude declined for a third day in New
York trading.  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)  fell 4.3 percent to 1,440 pence,
dropping for a sixth day, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. downgraded the
shares.  Meyer Burger Technology AG, the biggest maker of solar-
panel manufacturing equipment, sank 6.6 percent to 17.8 Swiss
francs as Germany said it will increase the frequency of cuts to
solar subsidies.  Solarworld AG (SWV)  slid 6.5 percent to 4.04 euros in
Frankfurt trading.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  fell 4 percent to 52.05 Swiss francs as the
European Medicines Agency started a review of the Swiss
drugmaker’s Gilenya pill for multiple sclerosis after 11 deaths
among patients.  National Bank of Greece , the country’s largest lender,
added 5 percent to 1.89 euros. Alpha Bank SA and  EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA (EUROB)  rose 7.1 percent to 67 euro cents and 6.4 percent to
45 cents, respectively.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-largest
bank added 6.3 percent to 1.72 euros.  EBA Deadline  Banks had until the end of today to tell national
regulators how they plan to meet capital targets drawn up by the
European Banking Authority. The proposals will be discussed at
meetings in  London  on Feb. 8-9.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  gained 1.5 percent to 177.05 pence after
 India ’s  Supreme Court  said the mobile-phone company isn’t liable
for more than $2 billion in taxes on the 2007 acquisition of
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.’s wireless operations in the South Asian
country.  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  rallied 8.8 percent to 12.60 euros, a fourth
day of gains, after agreeing to sell its Polish insurance unit
to Talanx International AG.  Solvay SA (SOLB)  added 3.4 percent to 75.46 euros after the stock
was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at Nomura Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
