Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s fourth-biggest airline, declined for a seventh day, its
 longest losing streak  in more than eight years.  The stock dropped 2.2 percent to 13.50 rupees by 1:10 p.m.
in  Port Louis , the capital, heading for the weakest close since
September 2010. The shares have declined 10 percent in the last
seven days.  “The decline is on concerns arising from the reduction in
arrivals noted in December, the best month of the year for the
tourism industry,” said Kishen Nadassen, a senior research
analyst at CIM Stockbrokers Ltd. in a phone interview from the
city today. “Should the situation persist in January, we could
expect the airline’s performance to be much affected.”  Mauritian economic growth has slowed as the sovereign-debt
crisis in  Europe , it’s main market, curbed tourist arrivals.
Tourist arrivals in December declined 2.2 percent, Statistics
Mauritius said on Jan. 17. The peak tourism period normally runs
from October to March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
