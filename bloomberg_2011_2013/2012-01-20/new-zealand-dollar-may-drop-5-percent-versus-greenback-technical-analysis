New Zealand’s currency may drop
against the dollar after it failed to sustain an advance above
its 200-day moving average, according to Gaitame.com Research
Institute Ltd.  The  New Zealand dollar , nicknamed the kiwi, may fall by
almost 5 percent, said Takuya Kawabata, a Tokyo-based researcher
at the unit of  Japan ’s largest currency margin company, citing
trading patterns.  The currency is poised for its fifth-straight week of gains
against the greenback, having risen almost 9 percent since it
fell to 73.71 U.S. cents on Nov. 25, its weakest level since
March. The kiwi on Jan. 18 climbed above its 200-day average for
the first time since November. It rose to 80.82 U.S. cents, the
strongest level since Nov. 1, before dropping back below the
average.  “The fact that it hasn’t been able to rise above the
recent highs opens scope for a downward correction,” said
Kawabata. “The kiwi dollar is becoming a bit top heavy.”  The currency traded at 80.18 U.S. cents at 7 p.m. in
Wellington, 0.1 percent below yesterday’s close in  New York .  The kiwi’s 14-day relative strength index against the
greenback was at 68 on Jan. 18, near the 70-level that some
traders see as a sign that an asset may be about to reverse
direction.  Kawabata said it may retreat to its 20-day moving average
of 78.76 cents this month, and should the currency break below
that level, it will likely extend declines toward 76.40.  The median forecast of analysts polled by Bloomberg News is
for the kiwi to weaken to 75 U.S. cents by March 31.  The 200-day and 20-day moving averages are technical
indicators that display the average values of a security over
those periods of time. In  technical analysis , investors and
analysts study charts of trading patterns to forecast changes in
