Ethanol futures gained a second day
in  Chicago  as corn jumped to a one-week high on higher export
demand.  Prices rebounded from the worst weekly decline since Dec. 9
after an Agriculture Department report yesterday showed
exporters sold a combined 264,700 metric tons of corn, the
primary ingredient of the biofuel in the U.S., to Mexico and
 South Korea .  “The corn market likely lifted that market higher,” said
 Terry Reilly , an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets in Chicago.
“It’s just a feature of corn that’s driving it.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery advanced 0.1 cent
to $2.132 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
fallen 8.2 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf decreased
1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.195 a gallon, and in  New York , it
declined 0.5 cent to $2.21, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast slipped 0.5 cent to $2.215 and in
Chicago the biofuel slid 0.5 cent to $2.10.  Corn for March delivery increased 5.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $6.115 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
