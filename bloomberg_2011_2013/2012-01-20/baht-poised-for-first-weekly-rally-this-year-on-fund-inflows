Thailand ’s baht was headed for its
first weekly rally this year after international investors added
to holdings of the nation’s assets on optimism economic growth
will accelerate.  Government bonds  were set for a third weekly gain after
global funds bought $170 million more local notes than they sold
in the first four days of this week, according to the Thai Bond
Market  Association (TBTVFCNV) . The economy may expand 7 percent this year,
incoming Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said on Jan. 15,
and his ministry estimates growth last year was 1.1 percent. The
baht reached a two-week high after U.S. Labor Department data
showed claims for jobless benefits dropped last week.  “There’s optimism about the global economy, especially the
U.S.,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. in Bangkok. “That led to some fund inflows into  Asia ,
supporting currencies.”  The baht advanced 1 percent this week and 0.5 percent today
to 31.49 per dollar as of 8:25 a.m. in Bangkok, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 31.47 earlier, the
strongest level since Jan. 4. The currency may trade between
31.50 and 31.80 next week, Hasegawa said.  Thailand’s imports increased 5.3 percent in December from a
year earlier after falling 2.4 percent in November, according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before
official data today. Exports dropped 10 percent following a 12.4
percent slide, a separate poll showed.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 declined
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.08 percent this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate slipped
one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
