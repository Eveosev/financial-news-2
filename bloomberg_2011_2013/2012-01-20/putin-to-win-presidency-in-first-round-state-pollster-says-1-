Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  will
win the March 4 presidential election in the first round with 52
percent of the vote, according to an  opinion poll  by the All-
Russian Center for the Study of  Public Opinion .  Communist leader  Gennady Zyuganov  would get 11 percent and
 Vladimir Zhirinovsky  of the nationalist Liberal Democrat Party
would get nine percent, according to the survey of 1,600
Russians. The poll was conducted Jan. 14-15 and the margin of
error was 3.4 percentage points, the organization, known as
VTsIOM, said on its website.  Putin would get 45 percent of votes, requiring a second
round 21 days later, according to another  survey  by the Public
Opinion Foundation, known by its Russian acronym, FOM. Zyuganov
had 11 percent and Zhirinovsky 10 percent support, according to
survey of 3,000 Russians conducted from Jan. 14-15, FOM said on
its website, without giving any margin of error.  Putin, 59, is facing the biggest challenge to his rule
since he came to power 12 years ago. Major challengers in the
presidential race are backing demands for new parliamentary
elections after allegations of fraud in Dec. 4 legislative polls
sparked mass protests in Russian cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
