GCL-Poly Energy Holdings (3800) ,  Asia ’s
second-biggest maker of polysilicon used in solar panels, fell
the most in more than a month after  Germany  said it will
accelerate subsidy cuts to slow demand for the modules.  The Hong Kong-based supplier was the  third-biggest loser  on
the Hang Seng Composite Index, declining 5.6 percent to HK$2.54
as of 1:40 p.m. local time. Seoul-based  OCI Co. (010060) , Asia’s biggest
polysilicon maker, was down 2 percent after falling as much as
4.1 percent on the Korea Exchange.  The polysilicon makers joined Suntech Power Holdings Co.
and LDK Solar Co., the biggest solar panel-makers, which
declined in overnight U.S. trading. Germany, the world’s largest
market for sun-based power, announced it will start reducing the
preferential rates paid to solar utilities on a monthly basis
instead of twice annually to slow installations and spiraling
subsidy costs.  A solar supply glut could mean many polysilicon producers
will either operate at a loss until cash runs out or close their
plants, Brett Prior, an analyst at GTM Research, said in a
report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
