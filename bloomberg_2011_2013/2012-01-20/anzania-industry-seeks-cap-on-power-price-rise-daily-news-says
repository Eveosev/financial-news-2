The Confederation of Tanzania
Industries wants the recent electricity price increase to be
reduced to no more than 25 percent, Chairman Felix Mosha said,
according to the Daily News.  The countryâ€™s energy regulator announced a price increase
of 40 percent last week, less than the 155 percent rise
requested by the state power producer.  The increase will be especially damaging to small and
medium-sized enterprises, as power accounts for 40 percent of
their production costs, Mosha said, according to the Daily News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
