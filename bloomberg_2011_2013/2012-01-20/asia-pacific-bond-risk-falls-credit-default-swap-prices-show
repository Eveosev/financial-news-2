The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment fell,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 6 basis points to 191 as of 8:46
a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The measure is set for its lowest close since Dec. 7, according
to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index decreased 4 basis points to
174 as of 9:42 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
gauge is set for its lowest close since Nov. 4, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index declined 7 basis points
to 164 as of 11:46 a.m. in Sydney, RBS prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
