Emerging-market equity funds took in
$1.93 billion in the week to Jan. 18, while those dedicated to
bonds attracted $172 million,  Barclays Capital  said, citing data
from U.S.-based researcher EPFR Global.  Stock funds focused on  Asia  had the biggest inflows of $703
million, after China’s fourth-quarter economic growth suggested
a “soft landing,” Barclays’ analysts Alanna Gregory,  Koon Chow 
and Avanti Save wrote in a report today.  The MSCI Emerging-Markets Index of  shares  rose 4.2 percent
this week, taking gains for the year to 8.4 percent. An
improvement in data from the U.S. and a decline in European
borrowing costs boosted sentiment for assets in developing
countries. A gauge of local-currency bonds in Asia compiled by
HSBC Holdings Plc returned 2.2 percent this year, while JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Composite Index of emerging-market
debt  climbed  0.2 percent.  Dollar-denominated notes of developing nations lured $158
million in investment for the week, while local-currency
securities had withdrawals of $49 million, according to Barclays.  China ’s gross domestic product rose 8.9 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
in Beijing on Jan. 17, exceeding the 8.7 percent median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
