MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA , the
miner controlled by Brazil’s richest man  Eike Batista , said it’s
not interested in a deal with  Ferrous Resources Ltd (FER)  after the
closely held iron-ore producer proposed a takeover.  Ferrous, backed by billionaire  Philip Falcone ’s Harbinger
Capital Partners LLC hedge fund in New York, proposed on Dec. 19
a $2.3 billion takeover of MMX, according to a letter of the
plan obtained by Bloomberg News. The companies held “several
discussions” on a merger over the past 18 months, according to
the letter, to which a response was requested by Jan. 10.  The Brazilian company made an initial proposal on a
possible combination with Ferrous on Nov. 15, 2010, according to
the letter. Ferrous’ advisers at Deutsche Bank AG and  MMX (MMXM3) 
representatives also had talks in August last year, it says.  Harbinger held more than 26 percent of Ferrous as of March.
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, held
talks to potentially take over Ferrous last year, two people
with knowledge of the negotiations said in October. MMX, in
which billionaire Batista controls a 42 percent  stake , has a
market value of 4.59 billion reais ($2.60 billion.)  MMX yesterday jumped as much as 5.8 percent, and fell 0.7
percent to 7.40 reais at its closing in Sao Paulo trading.
Ferrous’s proposal values MMX at 6.63 reais a share based on the
30-day average price as of Dec. 16, according to the proposal.  Ferrous holders would own 53 percent of the combined
company, with MMX owners having the rest, according to the
proposal, signed by shareholders of Ferrous and addressed to Rio
de Janeiro-based MMX’s board.  MMX Valuation  MMX, in a statement sent after the close of trading
yesterday, said it’s not interested in a merger with Ferrous. An
official at the company wouldn’t confirm if MMX has replied to
Ferrous’ proposal.  Ferrous said MMX was worth $4.96 billion using a so-called
sum-of-the-parts valuation, the letter shows. The merger would
create a company, which would be listed on the Novo Mercado,
with an equity value of $4.87 billion, it said. Bovespa’s Novo
Mercado is a segment of  Brazil ’s stock exchange with stricter
requirements for disclosure.  Philip Walters, an external spokesman for Ferrous in
 London , declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.
Lew Phelps, a spokesman for Harbinger, declined to comment.  While its base case was for an acquisition of MMX through a
merger of shares, “Ferrous is open to considering other
mutually beneficial structures, including a potential
transaction structure in which MMX undertakes a merger of shares
with New-Co and MMX is the surviving entity,” it says.  CEO Steps Down  Separately, Ferrous said today that Chief Executive Officer
Mozart Litwinski is stepping down to pursue “personal business
interests,” according to a statement. He was appointed CEO in
April 2009.  Belo Horizonte-based Ferrous, which shelved plans for a
$400 million London initial public offering in 2010, began iron-
ore output in March of last year.  A combination of Ferrous and MMX “will create one of the
leading players in the sea borne  iron ore  sector,” the letter
shows. The new entity would have combined resources of 7.1
billion tons of iron ore and exploration potential for a further
3 billion tons. It could produce 59 million tons of the raw
material a year by 2016, according to the letter.  Board Approval  The proposed purchase of MMX was approved by Ferrous’s
board and shareholders on the board representing 72.2 percent of
the stock, the letter shows. The equity value for Ferrous under
the plan is $1.59 billion, based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation
of $3.45 billion, it said. Ferrous will also contribute $1
billion in cash, giving it an equity valuation under the offer
of $2.59 billion.  Ferrous has signed sales accords with  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  and  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  It was set up in 2007 and
raised $1.26 billion from private placements between June 2007
and August 2008, according to its website.  MMX plans to spend at least 7.9 billion reais to increase
its iron-ore production capacity fivefold to 53 million metric
tons by 2016 as it taps rising demand from  China  and other
emerging nations. The company is building its 2.4 billion-reais
Sudeste port in Rio’s Sepetiba bay, scheduled to start operating
in the first quarter of 2013, with an initial capacity to ship
50 million tons of iron ore.  Strategic Investors  Ferrous was in talks with potential strategic investors and
lenders to help fund a $4 billion expansion, two people with
knowledge of the matter said in March. The company had
discussions with mining companies and steelmakers in China,
 Japan ,  Korea  and Brazil, the people said at the time.  Ferrous had previously outlined plans to produce iron ore
at a rate of 25 million tons a year by the end of 2013, with an
expansion to raise that to 50 million tons by 2016. It
previously estimated the cost of the first stage of its Viga
project at $3 billion.  Brazil is the world’s largest exporter of iron ore behind
 Australia .  To contact the reporters on this story:
