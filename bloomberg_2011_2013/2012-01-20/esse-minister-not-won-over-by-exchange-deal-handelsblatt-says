The German state of Hesse has yet to
be convinced that a merger of  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  and  NYSE
Euronext (NYX)  would be advantageous for the Frankfurt exchange
operator, Handelsblatt reported, citing Hesseâ€™s Economy Minister
Dieter Posch.  Hesse will have to rule on the merger after the European
Commission decides whether the alliance violates antitrust
rules, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
