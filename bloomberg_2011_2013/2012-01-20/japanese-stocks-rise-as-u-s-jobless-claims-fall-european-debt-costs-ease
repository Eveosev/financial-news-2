Japanese  stocks  rose for a fourth
day, with the  Topix (TPX)  Index gaining the most since October, as
falling U.S. jobless claims fell and lower European borrowing
boosted the outlook for exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a carmaker that gets about 70 percent
of its sales overseas, gained 4.1 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306)  jumped 5.1 percent after Bank of America
Corp., the second-largest U.S. lender, swung to a profit. Real
estate companies led gains among the 33 Topix industry groups as
 Fuji Media Holdings Inc. (4676)  offered to buy Sankei Building Co. for
more than double yesterday’s closing price.  The Topix climbed 2 percent to 755.47 at the 3 p.m. close
in  Tokyo , its sharpest advance since Oct. 27. For the week,
Japan’s broadest benchmark gained 2.8 percent. The  Nikkei 225
Stock Average  rose 1.5 percent to 8,766.36.  “Investors are starting to reverse their risk-avoidance
stances globally,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at
Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “Money is flowing into the
U.S., where the fundamentals are good, and then is spreading out
to the rest of the world.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent
today. The gauge advanced 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday
after a report showed U.S. initial jobless claims dropped by
50,000 to 352,000 in the week ended Jan. 14, beating economists’
estimates as it fell to the lowest level since April 2008.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s biggest publicly
traded lender, jumped 5.1 percent to 350 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316)  advanced 4.3 percent to 2,373 yen.  Euro Yields Fall  European stocks gained for a fourth day, extending a five-
month high for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index, as  Spain  sold bonds
at lower yields. The debt auction helped the euro strengthen to
a two-week high of 100.06 yen today in Tokyo, boosting the value
of income at Japanese companies that sell products in the region.  Japanese exporters advanced. Toyota rose 4.1 percent to
2,729 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, climbed
2.4 percent to 3,430 yen.  Developers gained the most on the Topix after Fuji Media
said yesterday it plans buy the rest of Sankei Building for 740
yen a share. The broadcaster’s real estate unit soared by its
daily limit of 80 yen, or 27 percent, to 377 yen.  NTT Urban Development Corp., Nomura Real Estate Holdings
Inc. and Daibiru Corp. also rose on speculation the three units
of large Japanese companies could be bought out by their parents.
Nomura Holdings Inc. said the developers were cheap in a note to
clients yesterday.  NTT Urban, Daibiru  NTT Urban Development, controlled by  Japan ’s biggest fixed
line phone carrier, jumped 6.3 percent to 57,100 yen. Nomura
Real Estate climbed 6.8 percent to 1,193 yen. Daibiru Corp.,
which is half-owned by Mitsui O.S.K Lines Ltd., soared 7.1
percent to 499 yen.  The  Topix (TPX)  tumbled 19 percent last year amid concern U.S.
growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will damage the
banking system, damping demand in two of Japan’s biggest export
markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the index to
0.9 times book value. That compares with 2.1 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the U.S. and 1.4 times for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index in Europe.  Fujikura Ltd. and Furukawa Electric Co. gained  the most  in
the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  after Nomura Holdings Inc. said the fines in an
antitrust case against wire harness makers by Japan’s Fair Trade
Commission were in line with informal notification made in July.  Fujikura surged 9.7 percent to 238 yen, while Furukawa
Electric, which was not fined, soared 9 percent to 194 yen.
 Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. (5802)  rose 5.5 percent to 903 yen.  Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co. (7735)  declined the most on the
Nikkei. The maker of chip equipment fell 2.8 percent after
climbing 6.4 percent over the past three days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
