Canadian natural gas rose as extreme
cold in  Alberta  boosted local demand for the furnace fuel and
may crimp production.  Alberta gas rose 1.9 percent after temperatures in Calgary
touched minus 28 Celsius (minus 18 Fahrenheit) yesterday,
according to  Environment Canada . Extreme cold can cause gas
wells to freeze and processing equipment to work less
efficiently. Forecasts for snow and cold in the U.S. North may
not support gains in gas prices.  “It’s too little, too late,” said Carl Neill, an
consultant with Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “The question
now is how low can gas go.”  Alberta gas for February delivery rose 4 cents to C$2.15 a
gigajoule ($2.01 per million British thermal units) at 2:35 p.m.
New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for February delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  rose 2.1 cents to settle at $2.343 per
million. The futures slipped 12 percent this week.  Gas for prompt delivery fell amid predictions that U.S.
furnace use will be below normal next week. Demand for heat will
trail normal by 24 percent through Jan. 27, according to Belton,
Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
tumbled 16.12 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $2.4396 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western
Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 9.07 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $2.4186,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was down 7.33 cents, or 2.9 percent,
to $2.4841.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.5 billion cubic
feet, 270 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.72 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.22 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 850 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.59 billion cubic feet today, or 65 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.03
billion cubic feet at 12:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
