A blast followed by a fire at a
natural-gas station in the northern Iranian city of Rasht has
left one guard dead, the state-run  Mehr  news agency reported,
citing local parliamentary member Jabar Kouchakinejad.  “High gas pressure” in the pipeline was the main reason
for the accident, said Kouchakinejad, adding that further
details will be released by National Gas Co. The guard died of
“severe burns,” he said, according to the report.  The blast took place at the Lakan gas station in Rasht,
Mehr said without specifying when the accident took place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
