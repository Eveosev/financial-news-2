A U.S. aircraft carrier entered the
Asia-Pacific yesterday after leaving the command of the 5th
Fleet, which includes the  Persian Gulf , the U.S. Navy  said .  The carrier, USS John C. Stennis, entered the 7th Fleet’s
area of operations after almost three months in the  Middle East ,
where it was involved in actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the
navy said in a statement on its website yesterday.  The ship passed through the Strait of Hormuz on Dec. 27 on
routine transit, Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
5th Fleet, said in an e-mailed response to questions on Dec. 28.
A fifth of the world’s traded oil flows through the waterway.  The Stennis will stop in  Singapore  and the Philippines
before returning to the U.S., according to the navy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
