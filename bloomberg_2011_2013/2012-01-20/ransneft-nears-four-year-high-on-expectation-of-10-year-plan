OAO Transneft (TRNFP) ,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
operator, extended gains for a fourth day, heading for the
highest since February 2007 as the company prepares to unveil
its 10-year strategy at the end of the month.  Transneft preferred shares rose as much as 2.7 percent to
59,398 rubles and traded up 1.3 percent at 58,570 rubles at
12:18 p.m. in Moscow.  The strategy could help answer questions about Transneft’s
free cash flow generation and distribution, Constantine
Cherepanov, an analyst at UBS AG in Moscow, wrote in a note
yesterday. “We believe the adoption of the strategy will be a
positive catalyst for the stock,” he said.  Transneft’s board of directors will consider the strategy
on Jan. 31, the Moscow-based company’s spokesman Igor Dyomin
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
