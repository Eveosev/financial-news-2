U.S. stocks  rose  for a third week,
the longest winning streak since October, as better-than-
estimated economic data and company earnings boosted confidence
in American growth.  Technology and energy companies led rallies by nine out of
10  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  groups, climbing more than 2.7
percent. Sears Holdings Corp. added 46 percent amid speculation
it may go private and optimism CIT Group Inc. will approve
financing for the retailer’s vendors.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  led
Dow Jones Industrial Average gains after posting a profit.
International Business Machines Corp. increased 5.2 percent
after forecasting earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 advanced 2 percent to 1,315.38 this week. It
has gained 4.6 percent in 2012, the best start to a year since
1997. The Dow gained 298.42 points, or 2.4 percent, to 12,720.48
this week, reaching the highest level since July 21.  “The domestic economy is strong and that’s helped the
stock market,”  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage $23.4 billion at
Security Global Investors in Irvington, New York, said in a
telephone interview. “The market’s done pretty well in the face
of some good earnings news and it seems to be overcoming some of
the fears around  Europe .”  The  S&P 500  rose all four days U.S. exchanges were open
this week as data bolstered confidence in the American economy.
Claims for jobless benefits dropped to the lowest level since
2008 and confidence among homebuilders topped forecasts.  Earnings Season  Companies from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Union Pacific
Corp. and EBay Inc.  topped  analysts’ income projections. S&P 500
companies, which beat profit estimates in the previous 11
quarters, will report a 3.4 percent increase in per-share
earnings during the September-December period, analysts’
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show. Of the 51 companies in the
S&P 500 that reported results since Jan. 9, 33 posted per-share
earnings that beat projections, Bloomberg data show.  Equities have advanced this year amid improving economic
reports after the S&P 500 was virtually unchanged in 2011. The
 U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (CESIUSD) , a gauge of how much
reports are exceeding or missing economists’ estimates in
Bloomberg surveys, rose to a 10-month high on Jan. 6.  Technology companies in the S&P 500 climbed 3.3 percent as
a group, with an index of their performance closing at the
highest level since February. Microsoft Corp.,  Intel Corp . and
IBM added at least 4.9 percent as results topped projections.
Hewlett-Packard Co. climbed 6.2 percent to $28.13.  Google’s Expansion  Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the most popular Internet search
engine, slumped 6.2 percent to $585.99 as fourth-quarter revenue
and profit missed estimates.  Chief Executive Officer  Larry Page  is moving into new
markets to ignite growth outside Google’s traditional search-
based business. That effort contributed to an 8 percent drop in
the average price Google gets when users click an ad, because it
charges less for ads on mobile devices and in  emerging markets ,
said  Herman Leung , an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group.  Sears, the retailer controlled by hedge fund manager  Edward Lampert , gained 46 percent to $49 for the biggest rise in the
S&P 500. Lampert, who owns about 60 percent of  Sears (SHLD)  and serves
as chairman, may seek new capital and to reorganize operations,
said Paul Swinand, an analyst with Morningstar Inc.  Sears also advanced after Women’s Wear Daily reported that
CIT will approve financing for the retailer’s vendors, citing
unidentified people familiar with the plan. CIT is looking for
more detailed information on Sears’s financing and may require
letters of credit for all orders, Women’s Wear Daily said.  Quarterly Profit  Bank of America  rose 7 percent this week to $7.07, the
biggest gain in the Dow. The second-largest U.S. lender by
assets swung to a quarterly profit of $1.99 billion.  Goldman Sachs rose 9.9 percent to $108.74. Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein cut compensation 21 percent in 2011
as he reduced costs and focused on international growth to
offset a slowdown in trading, which contributes most of Goldman
Sachs’s revenue.  The company’s higher-than-estimated earnings contrasted
with reports from  Citigroup Inc. (C) , which fell short of analysts’
estimates, and JPMorgan Chase & Co., which matched projections.  Carnival Corp. (CCL)  tumbled 7.9 percent to $31.56. The company
owns the Costa Concordia cruise ship that ran aground off the
coast of  Italy  last week, killing at least 11 people. Carnival
halted advertising for its Carnival Cruise Lines and announced a
review of safety procedures in the aftermath of the accident.  Credit Suisse Group AG’s  Andrew Garthwaite  lifted his 2012
forecast for the S&P 500 to 1,400, citing the  European Central
Bank ’s refinancing plans for banks as a “potential game
changer.”  Garthwaite, the London-based global equity strategist at
the firm, had previously estimated the S&P 500 would reach 1,340
at the end of 2012. His new forecast pushes the average
projection of 12 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News to
1,349, implying a 7.3 percent gain for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
