Poet LLC, the largest U.S. ethanol
producer, said it’s shelved plans for a pipeline to deliver the
fuel because it doesn’t expect to get federal help.  The company, based in  Sioux Falls , South Dakota, intended
to explore the feasibility of a $3.5 billion pipeline in
partnership with  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) , Poet said today
in an e-mailed statement.  ‘We continue to believe that the pipeline is a viable
project with tremendous benefits for the country,” Chief
Executive Officer Jeff Broin said in the statement. “But with
little prospects for a federal loan guarantee in the near
future, we are currently focused on other efforts.”  Most  ethanol  is produced in the corn-rich Midwest and
shipped to other markets by rail, truck or barge. The additive
hasn’t normally been transported by pipeline because it tends to
collect water and corrode pipes.  Magellan pulled from the project early last year, Poet said
in the statement.  Poet said that financing a venture of the size planned
would require federal loan guarantees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
