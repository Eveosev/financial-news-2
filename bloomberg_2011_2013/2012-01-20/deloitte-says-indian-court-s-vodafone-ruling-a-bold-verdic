Neeru Ahuja, a New Delhi-based
partner at Deloitte Haskins & Sells, comments after  India ’s
 Supreme Court  today ruled that  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  isn’t liable
to pay tax on its 2007 acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.’s
wireless operations in the country.  Ahuja made the comments in an e-mailed statement.  “With this ruling, tax planning gets another life of
legitimacy in India. The Supreme Court has been bold in its
decision and restored faith of many foreign investors in India
amid an environment of uncertainty and gloom.  “Tax laws and tax practices will never be the same again
in India.”  The court ruled in favor of Vodafone’s appeal against a
claim of more than $2 billion from tax authorities, reversing a
lower court’s verdict. The government can’t seek capital gains
tax because the transaction occurred between foreign companies,
according to the ruling by a three-judge bench headed by Chief
Justice S.H. Kapadia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
