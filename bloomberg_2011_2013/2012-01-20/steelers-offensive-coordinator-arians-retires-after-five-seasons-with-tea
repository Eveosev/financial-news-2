Pittsburgh Steelers offensive
coordinator Bruce Arians retired after five years with the team
that produced a  Super Bowl  championship.  Arians, 59, led an offense that was ranked 12th in the 32-
team National Football League in terms of average yards per game
this season. The Steelers scored the 21st most points.  “I am grateful to Bruce for contributing to our success
and wish him nothing but the best in his retirement,” Steelers
coach  Mike Tomlin  said in a statement on the team’s website.  The Steelers were eliminated from the NFL playoffs in the
first round this season when they lost to the Denver Broncos
29-23 in overtime. They beat the Arizona Cardinals in the 2009
Super Bowl.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
