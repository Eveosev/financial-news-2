Canadian beef from cattle under 30
months of age can resume shipments to  South Korea  starting
today, ending a ban imposed in 2003 because of an outbreak of
mad cow disease, the Canadian Agriculture Ministry said.  The Canadian beef industry projects exports may generate
more than C$30 million ($29.6 million) for producers by 2015,
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said today in an e-mailed
statement. That amount refers to annual sales to  Korea ,
according to Gerry Ritz, Canada’s agriculture minister.  “This is an important step in strengthening our trading
relationship with South Korea,” Ritz said during a news
conference in  Alberta . “This, of course, is a great New Year’s
gift for our Canadian cattle industry and for the Canadian
economy overall.”  The government of South Korea published its approval of
import health requirements today and notified the Canadian
government that all “certification conditions are in place,”
which means exports can start immediately from beef
establishments approved for shipment, the agency said. South
Korea is the last to lift the ban after the 2003 bovine
spongiform encephalopathy outbreak, the agency said.  Demand for  Canada ’s beef to Korea is “very high as it is
across  Asia ,” and those markets will grow, Ed Fast,
international trade minister of Canada, said at the news
conference today. In 2010, the Canadian agriculture industry
generated some C$35 billion, including almost $2.5 billion by
beef farmers and processors, Ritz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
