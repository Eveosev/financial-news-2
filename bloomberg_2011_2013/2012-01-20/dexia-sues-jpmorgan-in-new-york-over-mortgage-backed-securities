JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, was sued over mortgage-backed securities
sold to  Dexia SA (DEXB)  because the loans underlying the securities
were allegedly riskier than promised.  Dexia accused JPMorgan and companies it acquired -- Bear
Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual -- of “egregious fraud,”
saying they created and sold mortgage bonds backed by loans that
they knew to be “exceptionally bad.”  Dexia, the Brussels-based French-Belgian lender, said the
complaint, filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court,
involves about $1.7 billion of mortgage securities. Dexia
suffered “substantial losses” because mortgages were of poorer
quality and the risks of default and losses were much higher
than represented, according to the complaint.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns & Co. Inc., 650180-
2012, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
