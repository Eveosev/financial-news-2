The  Indianapolis Colts  parted ways
with 10 coaches yesterday, two days after they fired head coach
Jim Caldwell following their worst season in 20 years.  The Colts fired eight assistants, while defensive backs
coach Alan Williams left to become defensive coordinator for the
Minnesota Vikings and linebackers coach Mike Murphy retired
after 14 seasons with Indianapolis and 27 years in the National
Football League, the team said.  The Colts couldnâ€™t overcome the loss of quarterback  Peyton Manning , a four-time NFL Most Valuable Player, who missed the
entire season while recovering from neck surgery. The team ended
the season 2-14.  The Colts have the first pick in the April draft and are in
position to take Stanford University quarterback  Andrew Luck ,
who is regarded by analysts as the No. 1 player available.
Manning is 35 years old and has played 14 years in the NFL.  -- With assistance from Erik Matuszewski in New York. Editors:
