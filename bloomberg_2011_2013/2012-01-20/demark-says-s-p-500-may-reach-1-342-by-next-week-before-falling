The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
approach 1,342 by Jan. 24 before retreating, said Tom DeMark.  The benchmark measure of U.S. equities  closed  at 1,315.38
today after rallying 4.6 percent in 2012 and 20 percent since
Oct. 3. He said in an interview today that the measure may get
to between 1,338 and 1,342, a level last seen in July.  “We still are confident we will hit that level or close to
that level,” DeMark, the founder of Market Studies LLC and
creator of indicators to show turning points in securities, said
today on “Street Smart” on Bloomberg Television. “We could
conceivably see the high Tuesday at the opening, if not at the
close of trading,” he said. “We’re very close.”  DeMark predicted on Dec. 5 that the S&P 500 would advance
to between 1,330 and 1,345 last month before the rally would
reverse. The  S&P 500  rose to 1,269.37 intraday on Dec. 27 before
ending the year with a 0.04 point loss to 1,257.60, the smallest
annual change since 1947. DeMark’s forecast in September that
the S&P 500’s decline would stop at 1,076 proved prescient when
the index bottomed at 1,074.77 intraday on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
