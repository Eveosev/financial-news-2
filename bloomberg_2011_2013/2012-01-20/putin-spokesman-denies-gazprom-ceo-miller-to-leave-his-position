(Corrects to say Vedomosti reported on speculation in
first paragraph, second paragraph.)  OAO Gazprom Chief Executive Officer
 Alexei Miller  is “rumored” to be leaving his position,
Vedomosti reported, citing several unidentified people close to
the state gas company. Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s
spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said it’s “speculation” that Miller
will be replaced, according to the Moscow-based newspaper.  One of the potential replacements for the Gazprom chief is
Leonid Mikhelson, chief executive officer of gas producer OAO
Novatek, Vedomosti said. The speculation wasn’t confirmed, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
