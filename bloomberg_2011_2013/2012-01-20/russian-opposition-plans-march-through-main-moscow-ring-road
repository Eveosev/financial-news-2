Russian opposition groups asked
permission to march through downtown Moscow’s main ring road on
Feb. 4, rejecting alternative routes proposed by  City Hall .  The groups today submitted a request for 50,000 people to
walk 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) along the Garden Ring Road and
down New Arbat Street to Revolution Square, opposite the Bolshoi
Theater, Olga Shorina, a spokeswoman for the Solidarity movement
that’s organizing the protest, said by phone.  Opponents of Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  brought tens of
thousands of people to the streets last month for two major
rallies in Moscow and other cities after allegations of fraud in
Dec. 4 parliamentary elections. Putin, 59, who’s running in
March 4 presidential elections, refused demands for new polls.  Moscow Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin ’s office suggested two
alternative routes for the march, because it’s concerned that
the proposed itinerary will create congestion on a Saturday, one
of the opposition leaders,  Vladimir Ryzhkov , said on his
website. Boris Bulai, a spokesman for City Hall, wasn’t
immediately able to comment. The Moscow authorities have three
days to respond to the request, Shorina said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
