Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTEL) , Hungaryâ€™s
former phone monopoly, won 2 megahertz of frequency in the 900
megahertz band at an auction,  Magyar Nemzet  reported, citing
results that will be published officially on Jan. 31.  The local units of  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  won the same amount
as Magyar Telekom and  Telenor ASA (TEL)  got 1.8 megahertz, the
newspaper said.  The result may be that none of the three companies will be
able to build a nationwide high-speed mobile internet network,
Magyar Nemzet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
