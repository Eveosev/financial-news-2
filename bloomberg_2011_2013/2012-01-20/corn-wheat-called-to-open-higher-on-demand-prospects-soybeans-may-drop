What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 1 cent a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on signs that demand is
increasing for U.S. exports after prices tumbled last week,  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des
Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that shipments from the U.S. will
increase after prices slid to a one-month low this week, Roose
said.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents lower on the CBOT
as rain was forecast this weekend in  South America , improving
prospects for crops hurt by dry weather, Roose said.  Soybean-oil 
futures are expected to open 0.25 cent to 0.3 cent a pound
lower, and soybean-meal futures may open 50 cents to $1 lower
per 2,000 pounds.
