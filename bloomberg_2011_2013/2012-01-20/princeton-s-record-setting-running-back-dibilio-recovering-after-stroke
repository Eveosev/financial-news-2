 Chuck Dibilio , the 2011 Ivy League Rookie of the Year after
setting the conference’s freshman rushing record, is recovering
in a hospital after suffering a stroke.  Dibilio, a 19-year-old from Nazareth,  Pennsylvania , is
resting after doctors at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in
Philadelphia removed a clot from the main artery of his brain,
his father, Chuck Dibilio Sr. said today on the university’s
athletics website.  “They are trying to find out what caused it, so they can
prevent it in the future,” the elder Dibilio said. “As far as
a long-term prognosis, we are a long way from knowing, but we
appreciate all of the support Chuck has received.”  Dibilio ran for 1,068 yards this year, an Ivy League record
for a freshman and the sixth-highest single-season total in
Princeton history. He was chosen conference Rookie of the Week
six times, and selected as the school’s first Rookie of the Year
since 1983.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
