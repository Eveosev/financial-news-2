Ukrainian winter grains increased
their sprouting rate to 84 percent of planted areas as of
yesterday, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  That compares with 75 percent in late November and 83
percent on Jan. 5, according to the ministry’s figures. Wheat
accounts for most of the country’s winter-grain plantings.
Winter grains in good condition covered 27 percent of areas
where sprouts appeared, or 1.89 million hectares (4.67 million
acres), the ministry said in a statement on its website today.  Ukrainian winter grains and rapeseed were affected by the
worst autumn drought in at least 50 years, which lasted for 3
1/2 months from September into December, according to the
national  Hydrometeorology Center . The government expects the
winter-wheat harvest to decline almost 46 percent this year to
between 12 million and 16 million metric tons.  Grains were in satisfactory condition on 2.82 million
hectares and classified as poor on 2.35 million hectares, the
ministry said.  Winter rapeseed was planted on 961,000 hectares and failed
to sprout on 201,700 hectares as of yesterday, according to the
ministry. The oilseed was in good condition on 33 percent of
sprouted areas, or 248,100 hectares, with a further 33 percent
rated as satisfactory and 34 percent judged to be poor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
