Raymond Mikulich resigned as head of
North American real estate at Apollo Global Management LLC,
according to a company spokesman.  “I can confirm Ray has departed the firm,” said  Charles Zehren , a spokesman for New York-based Apollo. He declined to
comment further.  Mikulich, former co-head of real estate investments for
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., joined  Apollo (APO)  in September 2010.
He left Lehman in 2007 as the commercial-property market peaked.
The following year, the investment bank filed the largest
bankruptcy in U.S. history.  Coburn Packard and Jess Lipsey, two other former Lehman
employees who joined Apollo with Mikulich, remain at the
company.  Mikulich didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment today.  He had joined Lehman in 1982 and was head of global
property investment banking from 1989 to 1999. In 2000, Mikulich
and Mark A. Walsh established Lehman’s real estate private-
equity business and raised its first high-return property fund.  Mikulich’s departure was reported earlier today by the Wall
Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
