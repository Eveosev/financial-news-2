JPMorgan Chase & Co .,  State Street
Corp. (STT)  and  Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP)  are among final bidders for
the asset management division of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Reuters 
reports today.  The German bank may decide to sell the unit in various
pieces, which would generate more cash than selling it as a
whole, Reuters said, citing people familiar with the
negotiations.  Klaus Winker, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, declined to
comment on the report in response to a request by phone from
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
