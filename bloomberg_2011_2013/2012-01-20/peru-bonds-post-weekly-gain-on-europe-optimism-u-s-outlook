Peruvian bonds rose this week,
pushing down yields, on speculation the euro area will contain
its debt crisis and as prospects for the  U.S. economy  improved.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.72 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. Yields fell one basis point in trading
today. The security’s price rose 0.16 centimo this week to
114.13 centimos per sol.  Demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets rose
this week after Spain and France sold bonds on Jan. 19 at lower
yields. U.S. existing home sales rose for a third month in
December, data showed today, while a government report issued
yesterday showed the number of Americans claiming jobless
benefits fell to the lowest level since April 2008 last week.  ‘Confidence has been restored in  Europe  and funds with a
lot of cash in their hands are putting that money to work in
regions where they see growth,’’ said  Diego Donadio , a Latin
America strategist at BNP Paribas in Sao Paulo.  The yield on the 2020 bond may fall as low as 5.25 percent
as Peru’s central bank keeps  interest rates  steady “for the
foreseeable future,” luring investors that borrow funds from
low-interest-rate countries to buy assets in higher-yielding
nations, Donadio said.  The Peruvian sol was little changed at 2.6915 per  U.S.
dollar , from 2.6920 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s
local unit. The currency earlier rose to 2.6910, its strongest
level since at least December 2008.  The central bank  bought  $150 million in the spot currency
market today to stem gains in the sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
