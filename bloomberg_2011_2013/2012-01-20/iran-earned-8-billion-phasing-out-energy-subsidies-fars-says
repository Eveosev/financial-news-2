Iran  has earned some $8 billion
since the start of the Iranian year as the government phased out
motor-fuel subsidies and prices increased, the state-run  Fars 
news service said, citing Jalil Salari, the managing director of
the National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Co.  Iranâ€™s calendar year began March 21. Under a five-year
plan, the Persian Gulf country started phasing out energy
subsidies in December 2010 and replacing them with cash payments
to the poor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
