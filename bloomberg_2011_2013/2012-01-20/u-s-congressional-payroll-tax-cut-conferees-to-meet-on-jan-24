The congressional conference
committee charged with resolving the impasse over a payroll tax
cut will meet for the first time on Jan. 24, House Ways and
Means Committee Chairman  Dave Camp  and Senate Finance Committee
Chairman  Max Baucus  said today.  The conference panel must decide whether and how to extend
a 2 percentage point payroll tax cut for workers though 2012.
Lawmakers agreed in December to extend the break through Feb.
29.  The biggest hurdle for the panel will be how to cover the
estimated $100 billion cost of a full-year extension. Democrats
want to pay for the bill by imposing a surtax on income over $1
million while Republicans want to freeze pay for government
workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
