Audemars Piguet  had record sales of
more than 550 million Swiss francs ($590 million) in 2011 as it
sold more than 30,000 watches, Le Temps said, citing Chief
Executive Officer Philippe Merk.  The Hong Kong market seems to have slowed a bit, Merk told
the newspaper, adding he is “cautiously optimistic” for the
global market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
