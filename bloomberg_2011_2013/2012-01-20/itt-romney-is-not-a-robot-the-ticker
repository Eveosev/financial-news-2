From the very start of the Republican presidential contest last year,  Mitt Romney  was the most disciplined, best prepared and most articulate of the candidates. He experienced no loopy Michele Bachmann moments. He advocated no empty Herman Cain slogans. He had no Rick Perry bouts of stupefying ignorance or cringe-inducing "oops." Romney's debate answers are sometimes astonishingly crisp. His stump speech rarely veers off message (and his message itself is usually on target). He has run such a highly professional campaign, and with such personal precision, that he is sometimes accused of being an automaton. I googled "Mitt Romney robot" this morning and got 2,170,000 responses. Yet when the subject turned recently to his personal income taxes, Romney turned to rhetorical mush. This doesn't mean that Romney has something nefarious to hide, but it probably does mean that he has something he wants to hide. The chances that Romney was unprepared in last night's debate for a question on his taxes are somewhat less than zero. For whatever reason, the question presents a psychological hurdle for Romney, causing him visible discomfort. His meandering response to what should have been a simple, scripted answer is below, courtesy of the  CNN transcript . (Francis Wilkinson is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.)
