EuroChem,  Russia ’s largest producer
of nitrogen fertilizers, bought 100 percent of Severneft-
Urengoy, a Siberian natural-gas producer, for $403 million on a
debt-free, cash-free basis to ensure cheaper supplies as
domestic prices for the fuel rise.  The asset is able to produce 1.1 billion cubic meters a
year of gas, or as much as 25 percent of Eurochem’s annual
consumption for the primary raw material for production of
nitrogen-based fertilizers, the company said today in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
