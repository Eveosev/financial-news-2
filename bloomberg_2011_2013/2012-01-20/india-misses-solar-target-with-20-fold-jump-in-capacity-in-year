Indian solar power capacity expanded
20-fold in the past year to at least 356 megawatts, a third of
the targeted level, after infrastructure, financing and weather-
related delays, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The country planned to install 1,233 megawatts of central
government, regional and pilot projects, the researcher said.  “Many projects in Gujarat state were delayed because of
transmission infrastructure problems, rains, and delays in
financial closure,” said Bharat Bhushan, Bloomberg New Energy
Finance’s New Delhi-based solar analyst. Some are just being
completed and more capacity is expected by March, he said.  The plans by the world’s third-largest energy consumer to
boost capacity have provided relief for panel makers struggling
with slowing growth in developed markets. Germany, the largest
market for the technology, said yesterday it will cut subsidies
for solar more rapidly to control costs, driving down shares of
companies including Suntech Power Holdings Co. and LDK Solar Co.  Gujarat, running  India ’s largest solar program, has only
commissioned 186 megawatts of the 933 megawatts of photovoltaic
plants due by Jan. 28, New Energy Finance’s data shows. Of 140
megawatts awarded by central government auction, 75 are built.  India had 17.8 megawatts of solar capacity in December
2010, according to the Ministry of New and  Renewable Energy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
