producer, plans to export four cargoes of Erha crude in March,
unchanged from February, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg

one Abo, according to separate schedules. The sizes of shipments
range from 525,000 to 950,000 barrels.  The shipping plan for Akpo is not available. Loading
programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by
field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply
and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
