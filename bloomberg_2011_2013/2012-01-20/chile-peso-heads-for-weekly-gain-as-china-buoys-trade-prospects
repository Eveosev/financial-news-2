Chile’s peso headed for its biggest
weekly advance since the start of December as the price of the
country’s principal export, copper, surged to a four-month high.  The currency has climbed 2.3 percent this week as copper
climbed 3.8 percent in  New York . The peso slid 0.3 percent to
491.95 per  U.S. dollar  as of 11:10 a.m. Santiago time today,
from 490.57 yesterday.  Copper makes up half of Chile’s exports and higher prices
for the metal boost the flow of dollars into the country and the
value of its currency. Copper, which retreated today, had gained
on speculation  China  will move to stimulate growth, sustaining
demand for the building material.  “Copper rose fast this week,” said Eugenio Cortes, head
of currency forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago. “There may have been some stop-losses when the peso
pushed through 500. There could be a bit of a correction in
markets and commodities and we’re seeing a bit of that today.”  The peso is the third-best performer of 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg this year after the Colombian
peso and the Brazilian real.  Chile ’s currency may struggle to strengthen beyond 490
pesos per dollar, Cortes said.  The central bank will open a five-day liquidity facility
today to remove money from the market after the overnight
 interbank rate  spent three days at 4.9 percent, 0.1 percentage
point below the central bank’s 5 percent target.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had
a $5.1 billion bet against the currency on Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
