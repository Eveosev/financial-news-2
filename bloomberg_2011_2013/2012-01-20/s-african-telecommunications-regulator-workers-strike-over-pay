Workers at the  Independent
Communications Authority of South Africa , the nation’s
telecommunications regulator, have began a strike to demand wage
increases, said the  Communications Workers Union .  “We are on an indefinite strike from today,” said Vulture
Ntuluki, spokesman for the labor union, by mobile phone from
Johannesburg today.  The union is demanding an 11 percent wage increase, a 1,500
rand per month housing allowance ($189) and a 1,250 rand a month
mobile-phone allowance for qualifying employees, said Ntuluki.
He said the majority of Icasa workers belong to the labor union.
 South Africa ’s annual inflation rate is currently 6.1 percent.  The regulator, which employs more than 400 people, has
offered a 5 percent increase, plus an additional 3 percentage
point increase for low-paid employees, Icasa said on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
