The  New York Yankees  signed  Brett Gardner  to a one-year contract and avoided arbitration with the
outfielder who tied for the American League stolen-base lead
last season.  The Yankees didnâ€™t release financial details of the
agreement in an e-mailed statement announcing the signing.  CBS
Sports  reported that the deal was worth $2.8 million.  Gardner, 28, hit .259 with 87 runs scored and 36 runs
batted in last season. He stole 49 bases, tied atop the AL
ranking with Oakland Athletics outfielder Coco Crisp.  In a four-year career spent entirely with the Yankees,
Gardner has hit .264, with 23 triples and 135 stolen bases in
163 attempts.  With 47 stolen bases in 2010 and 49 last season, Gardner
joined Fritz Maisel and Rickey Henderson as the only Yankees to
record consecutive years with at least 45 steals, according to
the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
