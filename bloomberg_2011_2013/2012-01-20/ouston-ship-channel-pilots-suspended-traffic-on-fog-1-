Ship pilots for the  Houston Ship
Channel  planned to resume guiding tankers and other deep-draft
vessels at at noon local time today, ending a 15-hour suspension
due to fog at the largest U.S. petroleum port, the U.S. Coast
Guard said.  About 28 ships were waiting to enter the ports of Houston,
Galveston and  Texas City  as of 11 a.m. local time today after
transits stopped overnight, Albert Hernandez, a watch supervisor
with the service, said in a telephone interview. Another 25 were
waiting to leave.  A dense fog advisory is in effect for the area until 9 a.m.
local time tomorrow, the  National Weather Service  said in a
 statement  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
