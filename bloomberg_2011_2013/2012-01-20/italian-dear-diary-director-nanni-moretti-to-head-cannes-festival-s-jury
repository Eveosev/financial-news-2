Nanni Moretti, whose “Dear Diary”
won the best-director award at the  Cannes Film Festival  in 1994,
will head the festival’s jury this year, organizers said today
in a press release.  “This is a real joy, an honor and a responsibility,”
Italian-born Moretti said in an e-mailed release. The festival
runs from May 16 to 27.  Moretti last year depicted a reluctant pope in “Habemus
Papam,” and mocked former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in
the 2006 “Il Caimano” (“The Caiman”).  To contact the writer of this story:
