OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN)  climbed for
the first day in three after the country’s biggest mining
company said it won’t make a new buyback offer to  United Co.
Rusal (RUALR)  and nickel prices climbed.  Norilsk’s shares rose as much as 0.6 percent, trading up
0.3 percent at 5,482 rubles as of 11:46 p.m. in Moscow and
extending their gain this week to 2.6 percent. The benchmark 30-
stock Micex Index was down 0.2 percent. Rusal’s Russian
depositary receipts climbed 0.4 percent to 224.01 rubles.  Norilsk has no funds for another buyback offer to Rusal,
which has “made its position clear” that it won’t sell its
holding, Norilsk Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Strzhalkovsky
said yesterday in an interview on Russian state television.  Nickel topped $20,000 a metric ton for the first time in
three months yesterday.  Prices for the metal  rose 0.9 percent on
the London Metal Exchange today to $20,379, climbing for a
second day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
