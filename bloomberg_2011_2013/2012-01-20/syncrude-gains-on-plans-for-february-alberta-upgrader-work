The discount for Syncrude oil
strengthened to the smallest gap in nearly two weeks because of
planned work next month at an  Alberta  upgrader.  Syncrude Canada Ltd. is planning work in February on the 8-
1 coker at its upgrader north of Fort McMurray, according to a
person with knowledge of the plans. The company will fix a
malfunction that has limited the unit’s production, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount to West Texas Intermediate narrowed 35
cents to $2.75 a barrel at 1:55 p.m. in  New York , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the fourth consecutive gain
after the grade sank to a three-year low Jan. 13.  Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from
the  tar sands  in Alberta.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI narrowed $1 to $20.  Bakken (USCSUHC1)  oil’s discount narrowed 50 cents to $4.50 below the
U.S. benchmark.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to
WTI added $2 to $10.75 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  increased
$2 to $13 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium added $1.90 to $11.45. Mars Blend
increased $1.25 to $8.50 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium added
$1.35 to $8 over.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  increased $1.50 to $7.50 over WTI.
