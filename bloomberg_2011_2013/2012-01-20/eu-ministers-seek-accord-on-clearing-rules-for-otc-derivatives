European Union finance ministers
will seek on Jan. 24 to thrash out a deal on regulators’ powers
over clearinghouses that handle over-the-counter derivatives, an
official for  Denmark ’s EU presidency said today.  Officials have failed to broker an agreement on when
regulators in the region can override national decisions on
clearing firms, said the person, who couldn’t be identified in
line with official policy. The U.K. government has sought to
limit the overriding powers, warning that they could be used to
pressure U.K.-based clearing firms to move part of their
business to the euro area.  The clash is blocking progress toward the region’s
implementation of an international accord to toughen rules for
trading and clearing of OTC derivatives. The Financial Stability
Board warned last year that nations may miss an end-2012
deadline for applying the measures.  The negotiations between EU nations have led the Danish
government to postpone a Jan. 23 meeting with lawmakers from the
European Parliament, the EU said in a  statement  on its website.  The draft law must be voted on by parliament and approved
by governments before it can enter into force.  To contact the reporters on this story:
