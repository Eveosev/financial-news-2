The European Union had its long- and
short-term issuer credit ratings of AAA/A-1+ affirmed by
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, a week after the company cut
the AAA ratings of France and  Austria .  The outlook is negative because of “ongoing risks” for
the Eurozone, S&P said. The long-term rating was removed from
CreditWatch negative, where it was placed on Dec. 7.   The European Union’s revenues contributed by AAA-rated
member states dropped to 33 percent of 2011 budgeted revenues
from 49 percent before the Jan. 13 downgrade. In last week’s
review, Germany and Slovakia were only two of the 16 countries
that were given a stable outlook.  “Nevertheless, in our opinion, the supranational entity
known as the EU benefits from multiple layers of debt-service
protection sufficient to offset the current deterioration we see
in member states’ creditworthiness,”  Frank Gill , an analyst
with S&P in  London , said in the statement.   The negative outlook corresponds to the negative outlooks
on 16 of the 27 member states, according to the statement.   “We could lower the ratings on the EU if the number of AAA
rated member states decreases, or if the EU’s headroom decreases
compared with its annual debt service, or if member states
default on payment obligations to the EU,” S&P said.  The EU and the European Atomic Energy Community borrow on
the  capital markets  under a joint 80 billion ($103.4 billion)
euro medium-term note program to give loans or credit lines to
member states, according to S&P.   To contact the reporter on this story:
