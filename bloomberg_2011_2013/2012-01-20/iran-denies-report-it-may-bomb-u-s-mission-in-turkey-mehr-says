Iran  rejected a report that its
Revolutionary Guard Corps may attack the U.S. embassy or
American consulates in neighboring Turkey, the state-run  Mehr 
news agency said, citing the Iranian embassy in Ankara.  “The Zionists and interventionist governments are not
happy about close relations between the two brotherly countries
of Iran and Turkey, and therefore have been sparing no efforts
to create tension in their relations,” according to a statement
released yesterday by the Iranian embassy. Iran is itself “one
of the victims of terrorism.”  Turkish intelligence sent a memorandum to authorities
around the nation saying Iran may order a bombing by the Guards’
Quds force aimed at provoking banned political groups into
action, the Istanbul-based Zaman newspaper reported on Jan. 18.  The attack would be in retaliation for  Turkey ’s agreement
to host a radar system as part of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization’s anti-missile defense network, Zaman said, citing
the memorandum though not saying how it obtained the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
