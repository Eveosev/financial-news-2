ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) ,  India ’s second-
largest lender by assets, rose to the highest in more than two
months on speculation that its asset quality has remained stable
and monetary policy may ease.  Shares of ICICI rose 5.5 percent to 840.7 rupees, the
highest since Nov. 11, as of 1:32 p.m. in Mumbai trading,
compared with a 2.6 percent increase in the  Bankex Index (BANKEX)  that
tracks 14 Indian lenders. The stock fell 40 percent last year.  “Lenders who reported results so far haven’t shown any
marked deterioration in asset quality,” said Nitin Kumar, a
banking analyst at Quant Broking Private Ltd. in Mumbai.
“Expectations of softening in reserve ratios and rates are also
driving the prices.”  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the nation’s second-largest lender by
market value, said yesterday that bad loans slipped to 1.03
percent of total credit as of Dec. 31 , from 1.11 percent a year
earlier.  The Reserve Bank of India had predicted last month that
non-performing loans could more than double to 5.8 percent by
2013, from 2.8 percent in September, in a “severe risk”
scenario.  Three of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict
the central bank will reduce the cash-reserve ratio by 0.5
percentage points at its Jan. 24 meeting, while two others
predict a 0.25-point reduction.  The central bank has increased borrowing costs by 375 basis
points since March 2010, seeking to tame inflation in the
fastest round of increases since the  Reserve Bank  was
established in 1935, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
squeezed economic growth to the slowest pace in more than two
years in the quarter ended in September.  ICICI is scheduled to report  earnings  for the three months
ended in December, its fiscal third quarter, on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
