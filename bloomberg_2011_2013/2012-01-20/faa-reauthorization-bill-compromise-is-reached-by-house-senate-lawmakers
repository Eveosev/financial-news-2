U.S. House and Senate leaders
reached a compromise on labor provisions that have prevented
passage of legislation allowing operation of the  Federal
Aviation Administration , a spokesman for the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said.  Congress has been unable to pass legislation setting the
FAA’s agenda and funding since it expired Sept. 30, 2007. The
compromise will allow passage of a bill “very soon,” Justin
Harclerode, the committee spokesman, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
