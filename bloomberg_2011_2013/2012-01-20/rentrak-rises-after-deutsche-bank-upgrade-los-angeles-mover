Rentrak Corp. (RENT) , a data provider for
the entertainment industry, rose the most in a month after
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  upgraded the company to “buy.”  Rentrak, based in Portland, Oregon, increased 6.7 percent
to $17.48 at the close in New York, for the steepest gain since
Dec. 20.  Rentrak added 51 new television stations for its ratings-
measurement service in the fourth quarter and another this week,
bringing its total to 129, Matt Chesler, an analyst with
Deutsche Bank in New York, said today in a note. The new
customers suggest the company has moved past a period of slow
growth in its TV business, he said. Chesler previously
 recommended  holding the shares.  “The disappointingly slow progress in linear TV
measurement has been one of the key reasons for our ‘hold’
rating, but momentum has turned for the better,” he wrote.  He raised his target price to $20 from $15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
