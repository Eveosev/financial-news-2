Sugar rose, capping the biggest
weekly gain in three months, on concern that supplies will be
limited before the next harvest starts in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producers. Coffee and cocoa declined.  Global sugar supplies may be tight for the next two months
as a drop in production in  Mexico  diverts sweetener from Central
America to the U.S., according to Bruno Zaneti, a consultant at
FCStone do Brasil in Campinas, Brazil. Harvesting of the next
cane crop in Brazil’s Center South, the main producing region,
may be delayed by rains, forecaster Somar Meteorologia said this
week.  “There are a lot of risks to supply, including Mexican and
Indian production and weather concerns in Brazil,” Dennis Cajigas, a senior market strategist at Zaner Group in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview. “The tightening of sugar
supplies are driving the investors to shift their market bias to
the bullish side.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 1.1 percent to close at
24.89 cents a pound at 1:45 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , after reaching 24.98 cents, the highest for a most-active
contract since Nov. 15. The price posted a weekly gain of 4.4
percent, the most since Oct. 14.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery rose
0.6 percent to $645.60 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe, up for an
11th straight session, the longest winning streak since Jan. 27,
2006. The commodity has gained 6.8 percent in New York and 7.2
percent in London this month.  Traders are betting that the biggest sugar glut since 2007
will shrink in the next harvest, reversing expectations from six
months ago and ending the largest decline in prices in a decade.
Raw sugar may rise as much as 8.7 percent to 27 cents by Dec.
31, according to the median of 21 analyst and trader estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Cocoa futures for March delivery fell 2.6 percent to close
at $2,259 a ton on ICE. The price was down 0.4 percent for the
week.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery slid 0.6 percent
to $2.254 a pound in New York, paring this week’s gain to 0.1
percent.  In  London  futures trading, cocoa dropped and robusta coffee
climbed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
