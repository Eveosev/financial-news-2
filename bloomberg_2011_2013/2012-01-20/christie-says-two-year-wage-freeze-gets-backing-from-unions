New Jersey (STONJ1)  Governor  Chris Christie 
said members of two unions that represent more than 5,000
workers have agreed to a two-year wage freeze.  The International Federation of Professional and Technical
Engineers AFL-CIO, Local 195, and the  Service Employees
International Union , Local 518, which are both covered by one
contract, ratified the agreement, Christie said today in an e-
mailed statement. The vote by a “large majority” will clear
the way for a contract retroactive to July 1, the governor said.  “I appreciate the union membership’s recognition of the
fiscal realities we continue to face as we work to bring New
Jersey state government back to a stable, sustainable and
affordable path,” Christie said. “Just as in the private
sector, public employees have had to face these economic
realities.”  The deal, first announced in December, freezes wages for
the first two years. Employees would receive raises of 1 percent
in the third year and 1.75 percent in the final one.  Christie said his administration continues negotiations
with other unions, including the largest, the 35,000-member
 Communications Workers of America . He said he expects similar
concessions.  The engineers’ union represents about 4,900 employees in
the executive branch and at universities who work in operations;
maintenance and services; crafts; and inspections and security.
SEIU represents about 190 workers at the Motor Vehicle
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
