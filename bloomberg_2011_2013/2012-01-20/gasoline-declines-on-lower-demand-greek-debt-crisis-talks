Gasoline fell after U.S. demand slid
to a 10-year low and as concern that an agreement between  Greece 
and its creditors will take longer to be reached sent the euro
lower.  Futures declined a second straight day as the Energy
Department estimated  consumption  tumbled last week to the lowest
level since September 2001. Greek creditors and government
officials were scheduled to meet a third day to hammer out
details of a debt-swap deal.  “The Greek situation is basically back and forth and
that’s kind of a negative for the market,” said  Phil Flynn ,
vice president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “And gasoline
demand is bad.”  Gasoline for February delivery fell 2.57 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.7901 a gallon at 9:49 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have risen 2 percent this week.  The euro slipped 0.4 percent against the dollar at 9:49
a.m. in  New York , snapping a three-day rally. A stronger dollar
reduces the investment appeal of commodities.  Gasoline  demand  sank 2.2 percent in the week ended Jan. 13
to 8 million barrels a day. Consumption over the past four weeks
was 6.1 percent below a year earlier, while total fuel supplied
in the U.S. was down 7.2 percent.  Stockpiles (DOESTMGS)  increased 3.72 million barrels to 227.5 million
in the week ended Jan. 13, the highest level in 10 months.
Supplies of heating oil and diesel rose 438,000 million  barrels 
to 148 million, the highest level in 13 weeks, department data
show.  February-delivery heating oil declined 2.27 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.0133 a gallon on the exchange. Futures have
fallen 0.5 percent this week.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.4
cent to $3.382 yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices were 8.6
percent higher than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
