New Hope (NHC)  Corp., an Australian coal
producer, said the process of selling the company remains on
track with genuine interest from third parties.  New Hope declined to comment on a media report that  Aditya
Birla Group  has decided to leave the process, the Ipswich,
Queensland-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Indian group has dropped out of the bidding process,
the Australian Financial Review reported in its Street Talk
column without citing sources.  New Hope fell 0.5 percent to A$5.63 in Sydney trading as of
11:18 a.m. local time, compared with the 0.7 percent gain in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
