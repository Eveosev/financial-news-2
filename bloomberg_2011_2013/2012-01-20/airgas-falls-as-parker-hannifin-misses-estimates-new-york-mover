Airgas Inc. (ARG) , the largest U.S.
distributor of industrial gases, fell the most in three weeks as
air-conditioning products maker  Parker Hannifin Corp. (PH)  cut its
earnings forecast.  Airgas, based in Radnor, Pennsylvania, declined 1.8 percent
to $79.40 at the close in New York, the biggest drop since Dec.
30.  Parker Hannifin said it cut its profit forecast for the
year ending in June because international demand is slowing. The
Cleveland-based company also posted fiscal second-quarter
earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Because Airgas and Parker Hannifin both rely on sales to
industrial markets, “that could be weighing” on Airgas shares,
Michael Sison, a Cleveland-based analyst at KeyBanc Capital
Markets who rates Airgas shares “buy,” said today in an e-mail
response to questions. Airgas differs from  Parker Hannifin  in
that it has almost no sales outside the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
