Orient Overseas (International) Ltd. 
agreed to lease a terminal at Port of  Long Beach ,  California ,
for $4.6 billion over 40 years, the biggest such agreement in
U.S. history, according to the port operator.  The shipping line,  Hong Kong ’s biggest by market value,
will also invest about $500 million in cargo-handling equipment
for the Middle Harbor project through its container unit, Port
of Long Beach said in a  statement  on its website yesterday.  “It demonstrates our long-term commitment to the Port of
Long Beach as the gateway of choice for North America,” Philip Chow, chief executive officer of the container unit, Orient
Overseas Container Line, said in the statement.  The port is investing $1.2 billion to consolidate two old
terminals into a modern one, which is scheduled to be completed
in June 2019 with annual capacity of 3.3 million 20-foot boxes,
according to  documents  posted on the port’s website. The new
terminal is projected to create more than 14,000 permanent jobs
by 2020, according to the statement.  Orient Overseas (316)  rose 1.7 percent to HK$43.90 at close of
trading in Hong Kong. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index 
gained 0.84 percent.  Separately, the shipping line said fourth-quarter sales
fell 11 percent to $1.35 billion as it carried fewer containers
and charged lower rates.  The company hauled 1.28 million 20-foot cargo boxes in the
period, a drop of 2 percent, it said in a  filing  to the Hong
Kong stock exchange. Average revenue per box dropped 9.4
percent, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
