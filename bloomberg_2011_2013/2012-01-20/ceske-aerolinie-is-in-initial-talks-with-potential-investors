Ceske Aerolinie AS, the Czech state-
run airline known as CSA, is in initial talks with potential
investors that would be interested in entering into the company,
Cesky Aeroholding spokeswoman Michaela Lagronova said.  “We are trying to find an investor and we are having some
talks that are in a very initial stage,” Lagronova said today
by phone in  Prague . She declined to identify the investors or
comment on any further timeline for either a sale or finding a
strategic partner.  Cesky Aeroholding is a joint company of state-controlled
assets CSA and Letiste Praha AS, the operator of Prague’s
international airport. The Czech government, which failed to
sell CSA in 2009, merged the unprofitable airline with the
airport to streamline the company and prepare it for a sale.  Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas said on Dec. 18 on Czech
state-run television that a sale of the airline is the only way
of saving the company and that he would recommend it to the
government this year.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
