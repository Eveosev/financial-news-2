Most U.S. stocks rose, erasing a
loss for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the final minutes of
trading, as banks gained and results from  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  to  Intel Corp. (INTC)  boosted technology shares.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  added at
least 1.1 percent. IBM, Intel and Microsoft Corp. rose more than
2.9 percent as results beat projections. General Electric Co.
closed unchanged, rebounding from a 2.5 percent slump, as profit
 topped  estimates while sales were curbed by  Europe .  Google Inc. (GOOG) 
tumbled 8.4 percent as earnings missed projections. American
Express Co. slid 1.8 percent on lower-than-forecast sales.  Seven stocks gained for every five falling on U.S.
exchanges at 4 p.m. New York time. The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent
to 1,315.38, extending its gain since Jan. 13 to 2 percent. The
index rose for a third week, capping the longest streak since
October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 96.50 points,
or 0.8 percent, to 12,720.48.  IBM (INDU) , which comprises 11 percent of
the share-price weighted Dow,  added  60.55 points to the index.  “It’s a mixed bag of earnings,” Bruce Bittles, chief
investment strategist at Milwaukee-based Robert W. Baird & Co.,
which oversees $85 billion, said in a telephone interview.
“Earnings growth is going to decline, but that’s already built
into the market to a certain extent. If earnings don’t collapse,
it won’t be a problem.”  S&P 500 companies, which  beat  profit estimates in the
previous 11 quarters, will report a 3.4 percent increase in per-
share earnings during the September-December period, analysts’
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show. Of the 51 companies in the
 S&P 500  that reported results since Jan. 9, 33 posted per-share
earnings that beat projections, Bloomberg data show.  Economic Data  Sales (ETSLTOTL)  of previously owned U.S. homes rose for a third month
in December to the highest level since January 2011, a sign the
housing market ended last year with momentum. Greek officials
and private creditors entered a third day of negotiations on a
debt swap deal that’s crucial to lowering the country’s
borrowings and freeing up a second round of international aid.  Financial shares had the biggest gain among 10  S&P 500 
groups, adding 0.7 percent. JPMorgan rose 1.2 percent to $37.36.
Bank of America advanced 1.6 percent to $7.07.  “The upturn is around the corner,” Chris Hyzy, the New
York-based chief investment officer at U.S. Trust Co., which
oversees about $325 billion, said in a telephone interview. The
rebound in banks “is a good sign. The financials have become a
more stable sector. That’s the first sign that within six to
nine months you could start to see the turnabout in the
financial sector.”  IBM gained 4.4 percent to $188.52 after  forecasting  2012
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates as fourth-quarter profit
rose 4.4 percent because of rising software demand.  Intel,  Microsoft (MSFT)   Intel increased 2.9 percent to $26.38. The chipmaker
predicted first-quarter  revenue  that may top analysts’
estimates, signaling that the shortage of disk drives that
throttled personal computer production may be ending.  Microsoft added 5.7 percent to $29.71. The company’s Xbox
business got a boost from Christmas shoppers, who snapped up its
video-game consoles and Kinect sensor controllers, and signed up
for the Xbox Live online service.   GE (GE)  closed unchanged at $19.15. Profit topped estimates
after the company’s industrial order backlog rose to a record
$200 billion even as weaker demand in Europe hindered sales in
health care.  Google tumbled 8.4 percent to $585.99. Chief Executive
Officer  Larry Page  is moving into new markets to ignite growth
outside Google’s traditional search-based business. That effort
contributed to an 8 percent drop in the average price Google
gets when users click an ad, because it charges less for ads on
mobile devices and in  emerging markets , said  Herman Leung , an
analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group.  American Express (AXP)   American Express lost 1.8 percent to $50.04. The company
reported fourth-quarter revenue of $7.74 billion,  missing  the
average analyst projection of $7.9 billion, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Profit excluding some items beat analysts’
estimates as card spending reached a record.  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  slumped 5.6 percent to $46.03.
The credit-card issuer seeking approval to purchase ING Groep
NV’s U.S. online bank said fourth-quarter profit fell 42 percent
as expenses rose.  Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB)  sank 2.9 percent to $13.17. Ohio’s
largest lender reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.46 billion,
missing the average analyst estimate of $1.52 billion, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. stocks are caught in “a vicious circle” of slower
trading and bigger swings in prices, according to  Pierre Lapointe , Brockhouse & Cooper Inc.’s global macro strategist.  Slowest Since 2008  Trading for the 50 days ended yesterday was the slowest
since at least 2008, when Bloomberg started compiling the data,
at 6.67 billion shares a day.  Similar averages for companies in the S&P 500 and the Dow
declined this week to the lowest levels since 1999 and 2000,
respectively, according to Bloomberg’s figures. They reflect
trading totals for each stock on the  New York Stock Exchange (MVOLNE)  or
Nasdaq Stock Market, depending on where it’s listed.  “Getting in or out of a stock causes more price
variation” because fewer shares are trading, Lapointe and Alex Bellefleur, a financial economist, wrote yesterday in a report
from their Montreal-based firm. “This increases volatility.”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or the
VIX, closed above 20 for almost six months before dropping below
the threshold yesterday. The time period was the longest for the
benchmark gauge of U.S. stock options since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
