Hungary’s flat personal income tax
will be part of financial-aid discussions with the  International
Monetary Fund , state news service  MTI  said today, citing Tamas Fellegi, the country’s chief bailout negotiator.  The negotiations will concern all aspects of the  budget ,
including revenue, spending and the tax system, MTI cited
Fellegi as saying after he met with European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn .  “The question is how this will feature during the talks
and what the consequences will be,” Fellegi said, according to
MTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
