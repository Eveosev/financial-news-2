Ghana Oil Company Ltd. (GOIL) , which runs
the second-biggest network of gasoline stations in the West
African nation, rose to the highest in three days as investors
speculate revenue increased because of a new marketing plan.  The stock gained 1 pesewa, or 3.1 percent, to 33 pesewas,
as of 2:39 p.m., in Accra, the capital, the highest since Jan.
17.  “We are looking for a turnover growth of about 30 percent
for Ghana Oil for the full financial year 2011,” Hilary
Lomotey, a stock trader at  Renaissance Capital , said by phone
from Accra. “The company has been marketing itself in a roll-
out strategy that has made its gasoline stations more convenient
for customers than before.”  The company’s results are expected by the first week in
February, Lomotey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
