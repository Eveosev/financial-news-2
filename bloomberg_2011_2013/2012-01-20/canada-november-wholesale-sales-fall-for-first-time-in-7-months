Canadian  wholesale sales  fell for
the first time in seven months in November on declines in
automobiles and farm supplies, government figures showed.  Sales fell 0.4 percent to C$49 billion ($48.3 billion),
Ottawa-based  Statistics Canada  said today. The drop exceeded all
15 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg  survey  that had a median
estimate of a 0.5 percent increase.  Canada will have “modest” growth this year led by
 consumer spending  and business investment, while exports are
held back by a strong currency, the  Bank of Canada  said two days
ago.  Agricultural supply sales dropped 8.2 percent to C$1.64
billion, bringing down the miscellaneous goods category by 4.4
percent to the lowest level since April.  Sales of motor vehicles fell 1.6 percent to C$6.08 billion
in November. Machinery, equipment and supplies, the largest
category in dollar terms, rose 1.3 percent to C$10.7 billion.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the impact of
price changes, fell 0.8 percent in November, Statistics Canada
said.  Wholesale inventories fell for the first time in 11 months,
by 0.1 percent to C$57.7 billion.  The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how many months
it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales pace,
increased to 1.18 from 1.17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
