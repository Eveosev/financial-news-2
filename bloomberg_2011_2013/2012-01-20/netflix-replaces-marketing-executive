(Corrects Friedlandâ€™s previous role in final paragraph.)  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the mail-order DVD and
movie-streaming service, is replacing its top marketing exective
after a customer revolt over changes to prices and terms.  Leslie Kilgore, chief marketing officer for the past 12
years, will leave that post and join the board, Los Gatos,
California-based Netflix said today in a statement. She will be
replaced by Jessie Becker on an interim basis while the company
searches for a permanent replacement.  Jonathan Friedland, who joined Netflix as vice president of
global corporate communications in February, was named chief
communications officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
