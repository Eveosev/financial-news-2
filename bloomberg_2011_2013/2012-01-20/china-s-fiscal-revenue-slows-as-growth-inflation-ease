China ’s fiscal revenue growth slowed
in the fourth quarter as the economic expansion moderated and
inflation eased, the Ministry of Finance said.  Revenue in the final three months of 2011 gained 10 percent
from a year earlier, resulting in a full-year total of 10.4
trillion yuan ($1.6 trillion) and growth of 25 percent, the
ministry said in a  statement  posted on its website today.
Revenue expanded 27 percent in the first 11 months of the year.
The ministry didn’t give single-month data for December.  The slower increase may pose challenges to government plans
to cut taxes further after the economy expanded the least since
mid-2009. China’s leaders may boost the role of fiscal measures
in 2012 as persistent  inflation  concerns discourage a sharp
loosening of monetary policy.  The scope remains “considerable” for the government to
support domestic demand by boosting income growth and cutting
taxes, Jing Ulrich, chairman of global markets for JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said in a Jan. 17 note. At the same time, “China
is unlikely to embark on aggressive fiscal stimulus spending, as
it did to counter the global slowdown in 2008-9,” she said.  The ministry signaled in August that fiscal collections
would slow further. In today’s statement, it attributed the ease
to “gradual moderation in economic growth, falling corporate
profit and decline in the rise of consumer prices from a high
level.” Inflation fell to a 15-month low in December at 4.1
percent, after peaking at 6.5 percent in July.  Tax Threshold  A 75 percent rise in the personal income-tax threshold in
September, falling vehicle sales and weaker property
transactions also cut the pace of fiscal revenue gain, the
ministry said.  The nation’s car sales slowed in 2011, trailing growth in
the U.S. for the first time in at least 14 years.  Home prices  in
December posted their worst performance last year, with just two
of the 70 cities tracked by the government showing gains.  Still, 2011’s fiscal revenue growth outpaced the 21.3
percent rise in 2010. Fiscal expenditures last year increased
21.2 percent to 10.9 trillion yuan, the ministry said. That
compared with a 17.4 percent gain in spending in 2010.  The 2011 fiscal revenue and spending data are subject to
adjustment after the ministry finalizes them in January, it
said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
