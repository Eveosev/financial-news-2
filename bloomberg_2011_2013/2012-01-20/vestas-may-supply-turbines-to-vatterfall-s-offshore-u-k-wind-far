Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the biggest
turbine maker, may supply turbines at a wind-farm extension
project planned by Vattenfall AB off southern  England .  Vestas, based in Aarhus,  Denmark , was appointed preferred
supplier for 10 to 17 turbines each with a 3-megawatt capacity
to extend the Kentish Flats park in the Outer Thames Estuary,
 Vattenfall (VATT)  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The extension could tag as much as 51 megawatts on to the
existing 90-megawatt project that’s operated since 2005 using
machines made by Vestas. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The contract may be worth 52.5 million euros ($68 million)
to 89.3 million euros, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance
data. The value would depend on the turbine model and the
presence and duration of an operations and maintenance contract,
according to the London-based industry analyst. Vattenfall
declined to comment by phone.  The Stockholm, Sweden-based energy company has applied for
permission to build the extension and expects a decision next
year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
