The pound strengthened versus most
of its major counterparts after a government report showed U.K.
retail sales rebounded in December, spurring demand for the
nation’s currency.  Sterling rose the most in week against the euro as Greek
officials and private creditors struggled to reach an agreement
on a proposed debt swap, damping optimism the sovereign debt
crisis is being contained. Longer-maturity gilts fell for a
third day before the Debt Management Office sells a 3.75 percent
bond maturing in 2052 through banks next week.  “The pound is resilient and we think it may have further
room to rise against the euro,” said  Adam Cole , head of
currency strategy at  RBC Capital Markets  in  London . “Policy
makers here seem to be working with one another rather than
against each other, and that’s positive for the economy.”  The U.K. currency rose 0.6 percent to 83.24 pence per euro
at 4:04 p.m. London time after gaining as much as 0.7 percent,
the most since Jan. 13. The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to
$1.5523, and gained 0.3 percent to 119.76 yen.  U.K. retail sales including fuel increased 0.6 percent from
November, when they fell a revised 0.5 percent, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today in London. From a year earlier,
sales climbed 2.6 percent.  The 10-year break-even rate, a gauge of inflation
 expectations  derived from the yield difference between regular
and index-linked bonds, rose three basis points to 2.74
percentage points, the highest level since Jan. 11.  Greece  Talks  The pound gained for the first time in four days versus the
euro as concern Greece will fail to reach agreement with its
creditors sapped demand for the 17-nation currency.  Greek officials will resume talks with private creditors
this evening in  Athens  on the details of a debt swap deal that’s
crucial to lowering the country’s borrowings and securing a
second round of international aid.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt climbed six basis
points to 2.12 percent after reaching 2.14 percent, the highest
since Dec. 15. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2021 fell
0.615, or 5.15 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 114.15.  The 30-year yield increased seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 3.11 percent.  Barclays Capital , Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc
and Morgan Stanley were hired to manage the sale of 40-year
bonds next week, a banker involved in the offering said Jan. 12.  Gilts underperformed bunds for a third day, with the  extra
yield  investors demand to hold 10-year U.K. debt instead of
similar-maturity German securities widening one basis point to
20 basis points.  Gilts handed investors a 0.1 percent loss this year,
according to indexes compiled by the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds dropped 0.2 and
Treasuries fell 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
