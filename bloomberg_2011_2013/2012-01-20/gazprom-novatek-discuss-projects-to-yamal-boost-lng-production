OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ,  Russia â€™s state export
monopoly for gas, and OAO  Novatek (NVTK)  may team up to boost liquefied
natural gas production capacity in the Arctic Yamal region.  Gazprom and the publicly traded Novatek will study raising
capacity near the port of Sabetta as part of proposals that may
include developing fields in the north of the Yamal and Gydan
peninsulas, the companies said in separate statements today.  Novatek, held by billionaires Leonid Mikhelson and Gennady Timchenko, already plans an LNG plant near Sabetta with  Total SA (FP) 
and other partners yet to be selected after gaining tax breaks
and state support for necessary infrastructure. Deliveries to
Asian, European and South American customers may start in 2016.  Meanwhile, the Gazprom-led Shtokman project in the Arctic
suffered delays because of a lack of incentives and its earlier
focus on the North American market, where shale gas production
has created oversupply and curbed the need for imports. Gazprom
and partners Statoil ASA and Total seek to decide on Shtokman,
including plans for shipments by pipeline, by the end of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
