Nigerian stocks  will probably
outperform bonds this year as company’s earnings grow, while
inflation expectations limit gains in the  debt market , according
to Lagos-based Vetiva Capital Management Ltd.  Equities offer total return of 19 percent in 2012,
including dividend yield of 7 percent, Vetiva said in a report
e-mailed today. Bonds will return 16 percent, with a 1 percent
price gain and 15 percent coupon, it said.  “With attractive market valuation on fundamentally sound
stocks, we favor equities as an asset class over fixed income,”
Vetiva said.  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) ,  Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) ,  First Bank of
Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN)  and  Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB)  have a “buy” recommendation
at Vetiva.  To contact the reporter on this story:
