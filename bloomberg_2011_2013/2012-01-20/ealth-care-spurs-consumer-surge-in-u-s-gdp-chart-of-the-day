Consumer spending  has surged as a
proportion of the  U.S. economy  since the mid 1960s, and it’s not
because Americans splurged on cars, clothes or vacations.
Instead they were looking after their wellbeing.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows household purchases as a share
of gross domestic product climbed from about 61 percent in the
mid 1960s to about 71 percent today. Excluding expenses for
health care, the portion would have been little changed, rising
from 57 percent to about 60 percent.  Medical payments now account for about 16 percent of total
consumer spending, more than food and clothing combined, which
make up about 11 percent, or housing, which accounts for about
15 percent. The rising cost of health care means it will consume
an even bigger share of the world’s largest economy as the
population ages, according to economists like  Jay Feldman .  “At the consumer level, it may squeeze out other
discretionary spending,” Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse
in  New York , said in an e-mail. “At the government level,
rising Medicare and Medicaid spending will inevitably put
pressure on other government spending priorities. At the
business level, it could curtail investment, or more likely,
suppress wages.”  The baby boom, the population bulge between 1946 and 1964,
added 9.4 million people in the 16-24 age group during the 1960s
and 7.3 million in the 1970s. Boomers started turning 65 last
year, and every day for the next 18 years, about 10,000 more
will hit the age that historically has been associated with
retirement, according to the Pew Research Center in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
