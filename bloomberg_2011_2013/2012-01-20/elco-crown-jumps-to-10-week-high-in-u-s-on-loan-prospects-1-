(Corrects story published on Jan. 19 to show venture is
between Lawrence Ho and  James Packer .)  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  rose
to a two-month high in U.S. trading on speculation the Macau
casino venture between Lawrence Ho and James Packer is seeking a
loan to fund the development of a new project.  American depositary receipts  of Melco gained 3.2 percent to
$11.18 by 10:41 a.m. in  New York , the highest intraday level
since Nov. 9. The ADRs, each representing three common shares in
the Hong Kong-based company, have increased 6.2 percent over the
past three days.  Melco Crown approached banks to finance its Studio City
project in the former Portuguese colony city that is the only
place in  China  where public gambling is allowed, according to
four people familiar with the matter who asked not to be
identified as the details are private. The loan may be about
$1.25 billion, two of the people said.  Studio City will be an integrated resort with a “theme and
demographic focus” aimed at differentiating it from the
company’s existing portfolio of assets, according to Melco
Crown’s website. The company is about three to four weeks away
from hiring banks, the people said.  Melco Crown’s shares gained 2.2 percent earlier today in
 Hong Kong  to HK$28.15, the equivalent of $3.63 per share. The
ADRs are trading at a 2.7 percent  premium  over the Hong Kong
stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
