Vinashin, the Vietnam state-owned
shipbuilder sued by Elliott Vin ( Netherlands ) NV for a portion
of a $600 million loan said the claim isn’t valid.  Only the loan’s arranger and facility agent Credit Suisse
AG Singapore Branch can enforce payment obligations on the
instruction of the majority of the lenders, Vinashin, as Vietnam
Shipbuilding Industry Group is known, said in its Jan. 9
response to Elliott’s lawsuit in  London ’s High Court.  Elliott, which bought part of the loan from Bank of America
N.A., also failed to properly notify Credit Suisse of
information as required by the loan agreement and has to prove
it’s a lender of record, Vinashin said. The shipyard received
the loan in 2007 and missed the first $60 million payment on the
principal in December 2010, putting the loan into default,
according to Moody’s.  Vinashin has since missed paying an additional two
installments of $60 million each, two people with direct
knowledge of the deal said on Jan. 18. Elliott is one of about
20 creditors with a stake in the $600 million loan with  Credit
Suisse (CSGN) , Depfa Bank Plc and Malayan Banking Bhd. also among
holders of the debt, the people said, declining to be identified
as details are private.  The case is Elliott Vin (Netherlands) NV v. Vinashin
Shipbuilding Industry Group and others, 2011-1296 in the High
Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division, Royal Courts of
Justice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
