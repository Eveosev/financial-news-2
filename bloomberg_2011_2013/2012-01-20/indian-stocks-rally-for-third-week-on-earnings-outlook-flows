Indian stocks advanced for the third
week as concerns over global economic growth eased and earnings
of some local companies beat estimates.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the nation’s third-biggest software services
provider, surged the most in two weeks after its net income
exceeded forecasts.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-largest lender,
advanced to its highest since November.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.5 percent
to  16,731.69, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai, extending this week’s rally to 3.6 percent. The
index has increased 8.3 percent this month, bound for its best
January since 2001, as foreign  funds  bought $1.04 billion of
stocks, erasing last year’s outflow of $512 million that led the
gauge to lose a quarter of its value.  “India’s negative macro overwhelmed the potential of the
country last year and that is changing on the margin leading to
some outperformance,” Jayesh Gandhi, an  executive director  at
Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told Bloomberg UTV today.
“We haven’t seen some of the fundamental factors changing, but
there’s hope. Equities are all about hope.”  Global equities have rallied this year amid signs the  U.S.
economy  is recovering,  Europe  will contain its debt crisis and
speculation that  China  will ease lending curbs to spur growth.
The EU is India’s biggest trading partner. Three out of eight
Sensex companies that have posted earnings for the three months
ended December missed analyst estimates. Forty percent lagged in
the September quarter and 47 percent in the June quarter.  A U.S. government report yesterday showed Americans
claiming jobless benefits fell by 50,000 to 352,000 last week,
the lowest level since April 2008. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
increased 1 percent.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. increased 0.6 percent to 5,048.60. The  BSE 200 Index 
rose 0.6 percent to 2,031.15.  Foreign  funds  bought a net  9.61 billion rupees  ($190
million) of Indian stocks on Jan. 18, taking their investment in
the equities this year to 53.1 billion rupees, data from the
 Securities & Exchange Board of India  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
