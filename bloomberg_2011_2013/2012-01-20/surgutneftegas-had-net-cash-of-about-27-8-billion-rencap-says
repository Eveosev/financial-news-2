OAO Surgutneftegas (SGGD) ,  Russia ’s fourth-
largest oil producer, had a net cash position of $27.8 billion
in the third quarter, Renaissance Capital estimated based on the
company’s financial reports.  The figure includes $15.8 billion in long-term financial
investments and $12 billion in cash and short-term investments,
analysts at the Moscow-based bank led by Ildar Davletshin said
in a note today. Renaissance Capital raised its recommendation
on the Surgut, Siberia-based oil producer’s common shares to
“buy” from “hold.”  Surgutneftegas, the Russian  oil company  with the biggest
cash pile, may start using International Financial Reporting
Standards in 2013, which investors tend to have more confidence
in than Russian accounting standards, as the government pushes
companies to be more transparent,  Renaissance Capital  said.  “We believe this will lead to a wider group of investors
appreciating the strong financial position of Surgutneftegas,
with a likely re-rating of the stock as a consequence,” the
analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
