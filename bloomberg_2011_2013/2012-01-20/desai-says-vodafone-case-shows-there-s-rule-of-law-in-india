Nishith Desai, managing partner at
Mumbai-based law firm Nishith Desai Associates, comments after
 India ’s Supreme Court today ruled that  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  isn’t
liable to pay tax on its 2007 acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd.’s wireless operations in the South Asian country.  Desai spoke in an interview with Bloomberg UTV today.  “We are all excited because this establishes that there’s
rule of law in this country.  “About 80 to 90 percent of the large foreign companies are
trapped into tax litigations.  “Now there’s a situation where the government has to
refund the tax collected with interest. That means you are also
inflating India’s budget. We must do a thorough scrutiny how
much tax is under controversy and how much tax we are collecting
in this fashion.  “At least now, there’s relief that people can legitimately
plan their affairs. I hope the tax department won’t bring any
amendment with retrospective effect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
