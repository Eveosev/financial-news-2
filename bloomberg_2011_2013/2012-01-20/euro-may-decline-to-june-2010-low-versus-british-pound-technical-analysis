The euro may drop to its June 2010
low against the pound if it fails to strengthen above a key
resistance level, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  A failure to sustain an increase above 83.71 U.K. pence,
the so-called three-month downtrend channel, may see the euro
fall to as low as 80.67 pence, a level last seen on June 29,
2010, according to  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity
and currency technical analysis at Commerzbank in  London .  The euro is “probing the top of the down channel at 83.71
and ideally we would like to see the correction higher to falter
here, leaving our bearish outlook untarnished,” she wrote today
in a note to clients. “We look for this to hold and provoke
failure,” she said, referring to the resistance level.  The euro traded at 83.46 pence at 12:45 p.m. in London
after briefly rising to 83.78 pence, the strongest since Dec.
30. The 17-nation currency has appreciated 0.8 percent this
week, poised for a second weekly gain.  If the euro falls to 83.05 pence, investors should place
bets it will drop to as low as 81 pence, Jones wrote in the
note. They should close their positions if the euro strengthens
to 83.80 pence, she wrote.  Resistance refers to an area where analysts anticipate
orders to sell a security. The stronger the resistance, the more
buying is needed to rise above that level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
