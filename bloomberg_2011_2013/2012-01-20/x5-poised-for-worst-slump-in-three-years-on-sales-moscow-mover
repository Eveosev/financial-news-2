X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE) , Russia’s biggest
food retailer by revenue, headed for its steepest drop in more
than three years in  London  trading as quarterly sales growth
slowed because of a “tougher” market.  The  stock  slumped 16 percent to $21.80 per global
depositary receipt by 3:32 p.m. in London. A close at that level
would mark the biggest drop since December 2008.  Net retail sales rose 16 percent to 123 billion rubles
($3.9 billion) from a year earlier, while like-for-like sales
declined 2 percent, X5 said today in a statement. Full-year
sales rose 32 percent to 452 billion rubles.  The sales “picture has reversed in the third and fourth
quarter of this year,” X5 Chief Executive Officer Andrei Gusev
said today in a statement from the Russian retailer. Results
were affected by “the tougher market environment” and a
“strong comparative base effect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
