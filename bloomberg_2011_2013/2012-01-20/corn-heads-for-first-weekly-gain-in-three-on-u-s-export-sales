Corn fell in Chicago, heading for
its worst January performance in two years, after the
International Grains Council said global production will climb
to a record.  Corn output will total 860.8 million metric tons in the
2011-12 crop year, 0.9 percent higher than forecast in November,
the IGC said in a report yesterday. The group also increased its
estimate for stockpiles. Wheat production will be an all-time
high 689.8 million tons, up 1 percent from the prior estimate,
the council said, raising its inventory forecast.  “Because the demand forecast was increased by only 2
million tons, the global market surplus has expanded” for
wheat, said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt . “The IGC likewise predicts record corn production in
the current crop year.”  Corn for March delivery dropped 0.4 percent to $6.0375 a
bushel by 10:35 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The grain is up 0.7 percent this week and has slid 6.6 percent
this month.  Wheat for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to $6.0625 a
bushel. The grain has increased 0.7 percent this week and is
down 7.1 percent for the year. Milling wheat for March delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris gained 0.1 percent to 198.75 euros
($256.80) a ton.  Soybeans for delivery in March fell 0.6 percent to $11.90 a
bushel in  Chicago . The oilseed has advanced 2.7 percent this
week, reducing the drop in 2012 to 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
