Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.
bank that makes most of its profit in Asia, is expanding its
private-equity business in Africa after taking a stake in a
Tanzania-based commodities distributor.  The London-based bank plans to open offices in Nairobi,
Kenya, adding to its premises in Lagos, Nigeria, and
Johannesburg, Ronald Tamale, director of Standard Chartered’s
Africa private equity unit, said in an interview from Gauteng,
 South Africa .  Standard Chartered took a $74 million minority stake in
Export Trading Group, which processes and distributes
agricultural commodities in Africa, India and China, Tamale
said. The bank intends to list ETG in the future, he said.  “Given that over 60 percent of the world’s arable land is
in  Africa , the African agri-sector holds considerable growth
potential,” Tamale said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
