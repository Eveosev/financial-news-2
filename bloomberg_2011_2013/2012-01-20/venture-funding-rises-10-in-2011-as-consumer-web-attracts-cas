U.S. venture investing rose 10
percent last year as firms made bets on consumer Web companies
such as Zynga Inc. and Twitter Inc. as well as startups that are
digitizing health records, according to Dow Jones & Co.  Venture capitalists poured $32.6 billion into 3,209 deals
in 2011, Dow Jones VentureSource said today in a statement. The
median investment rose 16 percent to $5 million.  Backers of Zynga, Twitter and LivingSocial.com spurred a 23
percent increase in consumer information services investments,
with that market attracting $5.19 billion. After raising  venture
capital , Zynga held its initial public offering in December, the
last of a wave of emerging Web companies to do so in 2011.
Twitter and LivingSocial remain closely held, with multibillion-
dollar valuations.  Companies focused on electronic health records and other
medical-related applications reeled in $633.4 million, a 22
percent increase from 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
