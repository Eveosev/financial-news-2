Yale University  will ban beer kegs
at athletic events and restrict tailgate parties after the death
of a woman at the annual Harvard-Yale football game last year.  The rule changes include a ban on large commercial vehicles
or box trucks at sporting events unless driven by authorized
vendors, a strict cut-off of tailgating once a game begins and
the creation of a vehicle-free zone, according to a statement
yesterday. University leaders sent out a campus-wide e-mail
detailing the  rule changes .  The Nov. 19 death of Nancy Barry, 30, occurred when a U-
Haul truck loaded with kegs lost control and hit a crowd of
tailgaters in the parking lot outside the Yale Bowl. Police in
 New Haven , where Yale is based, continue to investigate the
crash, according to the  Yale Daily News .  The new rules are effective immediately. The university is
also examining traffic and crowd control at sporting events,
security and other issues, according to the statement.  The changes mirror a policy already in place at  Harvard
University . The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based school has placed
limits on oversized vehicles and banned kegs at sporting events
since 2006, Kurt Svoboda, a spokesman for the athletics
department, said in a telephone interview. Harvardâ€™s student
tailgates end at kickoff in accordance with an ordinance of the
city of  Boston , where Harvard Stadium is located, Svoboda said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
