Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s suspended
$4.8 billion Peruvian gold project faces mounting protests as
opponents won’t accept an environmental review, regional
government official Gregorio Santos said.  Projects planned in the region by Newmont,  Anglo American
Plc (AAL) ,  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  and  China Minmetals Corp. (CMIN)  are not
environmentally viable, said Santos, who led protests that
forced the company to suspend the Minas Conga project in the
northern Cajamarca highlands in November. Demonstrations against
the project will resume Feb. 1, he said.  Protests by farmers last year also halted projects by
 Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO)  and  Bear Creek Mining Corp. (BCM)  and may
threaten $50 billion in mining investment commitments, according
to the Andean country’s Mining Ministry. The government said it
will hire international consultants this month to review the
Conga project’s environmental impact study.  “The problems caused by environmental impact are going to
get worse if the government continues to act as judge and
jury,” Santos, president of the regional government of
Cajamarca, told reporters in  Lima  today. “All these mining
projects are located in fragile watersheds so they’re too
complicated to be viable.”  Newmont fell 0.9 percent to $59.06 at 3:16 p.m. in  New
York . The stock has gained 6 percent over the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
