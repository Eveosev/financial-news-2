The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of the close in  Buenos
Aires .  The  Merval (MERVAL)  Index fell 0.5 percent to 2,867.59.  Petrolera del Conosur SA  (PSUR AF) rose 16 percent to 1
peso and has increased 33 percent in the last two days.
Conosur’s controller, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, will enter the
refining business in Argentina, Argentina’s Planning minister
Julio de Vido said Jan. 18 in a visit to Caracas. There is also
speculation that the company could be a takeover target,
Guillermo Maresco, a trader at Nacion Bursatil, said in a
telephone interview from Buenos Aires.  YPF SA (YPFD)  , Argentina’s largest oil company,
increased 1.9 percent to 181.9 pesos, its fourth day of gains.
Investors are betting that recent announcements of a government
probe into fuel-price distortions won’t affect the company’s
results, Mariano Tavelli, president of Buenos Aires-based
brokerage firm Tavelli & Cia, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
