Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO) ,  Ford Motor
Co. (F) ’s unit in Turkey, gained after Goldman Sachs removed the
share from its “focus sell” list, citing dividend expectations
and stronger-than-expected market share.  Ford Otosan gained 2 percent to 17.80 liras at 10:26 a.m.
in Istanbul, bringing the gain this week to 11 percent.
Goldman’s price estimate for Ford Otosan, as the company is
known, is 12.40 liras, according to an e-mailed report today.  Goldman kept its “sell” rating on the stock, saying
it would lag the main ISE National 100 over 12 months after
outperforming by 41 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
