     Jan. 20 (Bloomberg) --The U.S. plans to give  Mozambique 
equipment to improve customs inspections and will help the
southern African nation restart its clothing and textile
industry, the U.S. embassy said.  It will also add fruit juices to the list of products
Mozambique can ship to the U.S. under the Africa Growth and
Opportunities Act, which offers certain countries duty-free
status, the embassy in Maputo, Mozambique’s capital, said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The U.S. will give $500,000 for new customs-scanning
equipment and help the country set up a plan to produce drought-
resistant corn, cotton and fruit, it said.  Mozambique’s exports to the U.S. include titanium, cashew
nuts and semi-precious stones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
