Google Inc. (GOOG)  options traders who made
bullish bets before the company’s quarterly report yesterday
suffered the U.S. derivatives market’s biggest losses today
after the search-engine operator missed analysts’ projections.  Google calls posted 10 of the 12 biggest declines among all
contracts traded on U.S. exchanges as of 4 p.m. New York time,
with each tumbling more than 99 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of the  Mountain View , California-
based company tumbled 8.4 percent, the most since December 2008.
January $595 calls, which expire today, retreated 99.98 percent
for the biggest drop.  “Google is a one-day play because it’s expiration the next
day, which is why it’s so hard to play on earnings,” said
Andrew Keene, an independent trader at the  Chicago Board Options
Exchange . “There’s no time for a trade to work out,” he said.
“It’s either worth something or it’s not.”  Options traders had boosted Google bullish bets at the
fastest pace in almost 10 months on speculation that the company
would report record earnings yesterday. That optimism backfired
when Google missed analysts’ sales and profit estimates, dragged
down by the European crisis and a push into mobile technology,
which yields lower ad revenue.  Google reported fourth-quarter sales, excluding revenue
passed on to partner sites, of $8.13 billion, falling short of
the $8.41 billion average  estimate  of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Profit before certain costs was $9.50 a share,
missing the $10.50 analyst forecast. Google had  beaten  earnings-
per-share predictions in 11 of its prior 13 quarters.  Put Buying  Investors who bought Google puts yesterday to protect
against a decline in the shares made money today. January $610
puts rallied 407 percent to $24.40 from $4.81 yesterday for the
largest gain among all Google options. January $605 puts had the
second-biggest gain, rising 365 percent to $19.47.  Google call-option volume was 150,556 contracts, less than
trading in bearish bets, or puts, which was 169,301. Trading
 volume  in Google call contracts rose to a two-month high
yesterday as almost 130,000 contracts changed hands. Call
options give the right to buy a security for a certain amount,
called the strike price, by a given date. Puts convey the right
to sell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
