The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  may vote in private to require  mutual funds  to abide
by new marketing and registration rules when they use
derivatives tied to commodities, according to three people
briefed on the matter.  The agency has circulated the regulation, opposed by
 Fidelity Investments  and Vanguard Group Inc., for a final vote
by the agency’s five commissioners, according to the people, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter isn’t public.
Commissioners can vote on paper without holding a public meeting
in a process known as seriatim.  The vote could be completed in a matter of days by
circulating the document for signatures, according to the
people. Commissioners could also decide to hold a public vote.  The rule would rescind exemptions from CFTC registration
for mutual funds that use derivatives tied to commodities. The
 National Futures Association , the Chicago-based self-regulatory
organization, sought the change last year to improve protection
of retail investors.  The  Investment Company Institute , the Washington-based
trade association for mutual funds, opposed the change in a
letter last year and said the firms are already subject to
regulation by the  Securities and Exchange Commission  and don’t
need a second regulator.  “The CFTC has provided little rationale for its sweeping
proposal, including why it is necessary to impose a second,
costly layer of regulation on registered investment companies,”
Karrie McMillan, general counsel of the institute, said in a
letter to the CFTC last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
