Hungary  must take “concrete steps”
to ensure the independence of its central bank, European
Commission economics spokesman Amadeu Altafaj told reporters in
Brussels today.  European Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn
and Tamas Fellegi, Hungary’s chief negotiatior for a financial
bailout, met today in Brussels amid a dispute over the
independence of Hungary’s central bank that has halted aid talks
for the country.  Rehn “welcomed that the Hungarian government is now ready
to engage in a dialogue and modify relevant legislation” and
“is now looking forward to seeing these assurances translated
into concrete acts and results,” Altafaj said. “Concrete
actions mean for instance that draft laws are also consulted”
with the  European Central Bank , the commission and the
 International Monetary Fund , he said.  “Pre-conditions” must be met for talks on financial
assistance to Hungary, he said. No specific date has been
discussed for the talks, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
