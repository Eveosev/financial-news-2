Petrolera del Conosur SA , an
Argentine fuel distributor, posted its biggest two-day gain in
almost three years after its controlling shareholder said it
plans to refine oil in the country and as speculation mounted
that the company could be sold.  Conosur, which operates service stations with the brands
Sol and PDVsur in Argentina, rose 16 percent to 1 peso at the
close in  Buenos Aires . It gained 33 percent in the past two
days, the biggest two-day increase since March 2009.  “Besides the refining news moving the stock, there are
ongoing rumors that the company could be sold,” Guillermo Maresco, a trader at Nacion Bursatil, said by telephone.  Petroleos de Venezuela SA, known as PDVSA, will enter the
refining business in  Argentina , Planning Minister Julio de Vido
said Jan. 18 during a visit to Caracas.  Gonzalo Rodriguez, a spokesman for Petrolera del Conosur,
didn’t return telephone calls seeking comment. Communication
officials at PDVSA didn’t answer calls or e-mails requesting
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
