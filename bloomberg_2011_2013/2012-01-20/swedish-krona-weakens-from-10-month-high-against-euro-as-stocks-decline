The Swedish krona fell from a 10-
month high against the euro and weakened versus the dollar as
stock declines damped demand for higher-yielding assets.  The currency depreciated against all 16 of its major
counterparts on speculation this week’s gains were overdone
after it climbed yesterday to a four-week high against the
greenback and the strongest since March versus the euro. The
Norwegian krone also declined.  “There seems to be a bit of  risk aversion , which is the
reason why the krona is softer,” said  Niels Christensen , chief
currency strategist at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “The krona
has done quite well against the euro and dollar this week, and
so it is making a little bit of a correction to the downside.”  Sweden’s currency fell 0.3 percent to 8.7764 per euro at
4:01 p.m.  London  time after rising to 8.7429 yesterday, the
highest since March 3. The currency dropped 0.6 percent to
6.7906 per dollar, paring its weekly gain to 3 percent. The
currency reached 6.7375 today, the strongest since Dec. 12.  The Norwegian krone slipped 0.5 percent to 5.9341 against
the dollar, and was little changed at 7.6680 per euro.  The Swedish currency is approaching 8.70 per euro, “levels
that are associated with significant krona strength,”  Steven Saywell , head of foreign-exchange strategy for  Europe  at BNP
Paribas SA in London, wrote yesterday in a note to clients. “We
do not believe that fundamentals justify the krona heading into
a new paradigm of such significant strength and, therefore,
suggest it may not be sustained.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares dropped 0.3 percent,
and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent.  Benchmark interest rates are 1.75 percent in both Sweden
and Norway, compared with 1 percent in Europe and as low as zero
in the U.S. and Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
