Equatorial Guinea  will keep exports
of its Zafiro crude for March unchanged from February at three
cargoes, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  The west African nation will also export three cargoes of
its Ceiba blend, one more than February, a separate schedule
shows. The shipments are of 1 million barrels each.  Exxon Mobil Corp. operates the Zafiro field and Hess Corp.
runs Ceiba. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
