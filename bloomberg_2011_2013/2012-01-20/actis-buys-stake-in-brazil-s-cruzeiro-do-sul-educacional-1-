Actis LLP agreed to buy a minority
stake in Cruzeiro do Sul Educacional, a Brazilian operator of
universities, for 180 million reais ($102 million), according to
a press relations company representing Actis in  Sao Paulo .  As part of the accord with Actis, Cruzeiro do Sul agreed to
buy rival Unicid, said a Printec Comunicacao official in a
telephone interview. She didn’t specify the transaction value or
the stake acquired because the acquisition details will be
announced later today.  Actis is a London-based private-equity firm with $4.6
billion under management.  Sao Paulo-based Exame magazine reported earlier today that
Cruzeiro do Sul agreed to pay 180 million reais for Unicid,  and
that Actis bought a 37 percent stake in Cruzeiro do Sul.  Actis is considering new acquisitions in  Brazil ’s education
sector, the company said in an e-mailed statement sent today by
Printec.  To contact the reporter on this story:
