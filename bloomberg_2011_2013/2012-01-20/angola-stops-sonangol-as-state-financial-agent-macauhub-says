Sonangol EP, the national oil
company of  Angola , is no longer allowed to act as a financial
agent of the state, Macauhub  reported , citing Finance Minister
Carlos Lopes.  The government of  Africa ’s second-largest crude producer
made the decision Dec. 22, while granting “temporary”
exceptions for the company to help pay government debt and fuel-
price subsidies, the Macau-based news website cited Lopes as
saying. Sonangol’s role in state finances expanded during the
country’s 27-year civil war, which ended in 2002, Macauhub said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
