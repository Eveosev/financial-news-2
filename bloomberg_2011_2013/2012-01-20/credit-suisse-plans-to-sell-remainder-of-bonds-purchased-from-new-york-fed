Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  plans to
distribute the remainder of the $7 billion of mortgage bonds
that it didn’t immediately sell after buying them yesterday from
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Credit Suisse’s investment bank has already placed a
“significant” portion of the securities with clients, Steven Vames, a New York-based spokesman for the firm, said today in a
telephone interview.  The central bank sold the bonds, which it assumed in the
2008 rescue of  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , through a
“competitive process” after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  made an
unsolicited offer to buy assets held in a vehicle called Maiden
Lane II LLC, according to a statement posted yesterday on the
 New York  Fed’s website. The price wasn’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
