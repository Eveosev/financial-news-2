Steve Spagnuolo will become
defensive coordinator for the  New Orleans Saints  less than three
weeks after being fired as coach of the St. Louis Rams, the
Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the
decision.  Spagnuolo, 52, was fired Jan. 2 after the Rams went 2-14 to
tie the Indianapolis Colts for the worst record in the National
Football League. He had a 10-38 record since joining St. Louis
in January 2009.  Spagnuolo replaces Gregg Williams, who was New Orleansâ€™
defensive coordinator the past three seasons. He went to the
Rams, who hired  Jeff Fisher  as head coach.  Before taking over in St. Louis, Spagnuolo had top 10
defenses with the  New York Giants  in the 2007 and 2008 seasons,
AP reported. His 2007 defense led the NFL with 53 sacks and the
2008 unit was sixth in the league with 42.  To contact the reporter on this story:
