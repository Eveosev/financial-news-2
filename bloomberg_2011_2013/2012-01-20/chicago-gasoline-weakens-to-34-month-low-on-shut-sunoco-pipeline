Gasoline in  Chicago  weakened to the
lowest level in 34 months after federal regulators ordered that
a  Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL)  pipeline in  Ohio  remain shut
following a Jan. 12 spill.  The 8-inch pipeline, which carries products from Fostoria
to Hudson in Ohio, must remain shut until Sunoco Logistics
complies with a corrective action order following a 116,760-
gallon gasoline spill, according to the U.S. Department of
Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration.  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  is operating the  Toledo (SUTOCRUD)  refinery in Ohio at
reduced rates of 130,000 to 140,000 barrels a day because of low
gasoline demand, a person with knowledge of the situation said
today.  “If they try to place those extra barrels, it’s going to
be 10 cents cheaper,” Steve Mosby, vice president of ADMO
Energy LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said
in an telephone interview. “That’s the nature of Chicago.
There’s a lot of barrels there because it’s all refineries.”  Conventional, 87-octane  gasoline  in Chicago sank to a
discount of 30 cents a gallon versus futures traded on the New
York Mercantile exchange at 2:41 p.m., the lowest level since
March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Prompt-
delivery (CHOR87PC)  of the fuel fell 4.06 cents to $2.4852 a gallon.  “The shutdown of the pipeline has had an impact on a few
of the terminals we utilize off that line,” said Mike Gayda, a
Parsippany, New Jersey-based spokesman and president at PBF
Energy. “We have redirected some of our customers to terminals
nearby where we have supply.”  Midwest Inventories  Gasoline inventories  in the Midwest, known as the Padd 2
region, rose 2.3 percent last week to 54.7 million barrels, the
Energy Department reported yesterday. Supplies have climbed six
of the past seven weeks to the highest level since Feb. 25.  Conventional 87-octane gasoline in the  Midwest (GRP3G387)  fell 0.5
cent to a discount of 22 cents.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  fell for the third straight
day, by 0.75 cent to a discount of 3 cents to futures. That’s
the lowest level for the fuel in seven days.  Gasoline in the New York Harbor slipped 0.17 cent to a
premium of 2.38 cents a gallon against futures. Hovensa LLC, a
partnership of  Hess Corp. (HES)  and  Petroleos de Venezuela SA ,
announced Jan. 18 that the  St. Croix (HOSCCRUD)  refinery in the  U.S. Virgin
Islands  will shut because of weak demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
