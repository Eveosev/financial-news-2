Hungary needs at least 100 billion
forint ($427 million) in adjustments to meet its 2012  budget 
target because of recent government measures boosting
expenditures,  Vilaggazdasag  reported today.  State spending on financial aid to foreign-currency
mortgage borrowers may raise budget outlays by 67 billion forint
above the initial plan, the Budapest-based newspaper said.  The repayment of foreign-currency state debt will cost tens
of billions of forint more than initially estimated as a result
of the weaker forint, the newspaper said, adding that the change
in tobacco regulations may also sap excise tax revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
