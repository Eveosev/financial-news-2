Prices on defaulted debt sold by
 Metrogas SA (METR)  are falling after a U.S. court ruled against the
parent company and the government called for the company to
negotiate a new contract.  Prices on Metrogas’s defaulted dollar bonds maturing in
2014 fell 2.2 cents to 36.7 cents at 11:05 a.m. local time.  A U.S. federal appeals court on Jan. 17 threw out a $185
million award to London-based  BG Group Plc (BG/) , which claimed that
 Argentina ’s freeze on natural gas prices caused Metrogas’s
bankruptcy. BG Group, the U.K.’s third-largest oil and gas
producer, initiated arbitration in the U.S. in 2003 over the
gas-price freeze, which Argentina imposed following a sovereign
debt default in December 2001.  Argentine Planning Minister Julio De Vido applauded the
court’s decision and said Jan. 18 that the government called
upon shareholders to “definitively” renegotiate the terms of
it’s gas distribution license.  The court’s decision “confirms the absolute sovereignty of
the Argentine state in the regulation of its public services,”
De Vido said.  The U.S. court said that under the Bilateral Investment
Treaty between the U.K. and Argentina, which went into effect in
1993, disputes between contracting parties should be settled in
the country where the investment was made. Unsettled disputes
may be submitted to international arbitration after 18 months
from the time the issue was presented to the competent tribunal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
