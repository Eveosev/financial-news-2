The  Bank of Japan  will postpone
sales of shares it had previously purchased from financial
institutions because of developments in financial markets, it
said in a statement in  Tokyo  today.  The BOJ will push back the sales to March 2014 from an
earlier deadline of March 2012 and the transactions will be
completed by September 2019, also two years later than planned.  The central bank had purchased the shares to help Japanese
banks reduce stock holdings and to sustain stability in the
financial system in 2002. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  has lost
16 percent of its value in the past year after the nation’s
record earthquake and a yen near a postwar high against the
dollar eroded the profits of exporters.  “Uncertainties in financial markets still remain high,”
said  Hideo Kumano , chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research
Institute in Tokyo and a former BOJ official. “The BOJ’s sales
would have had an adverse effect on the market and that would be
contrary to what the BOJ has been trying to achieve.”  The central bank set a 3 trillion-yen limit on the share
purchases, which were initially announced in 2002, the BOJ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
