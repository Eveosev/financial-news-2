U.S. feedlots reduced purchases of
young cattle by 5.9 percent in December from a year earlier, the
biggest decline since May, after a drought in the southern U.S.
shrank the number of animals available for sale.  Feedlots (CATTLEPL)  bought 1.683 million head of cattle last
month, down from 1.789 million in December 2010, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. Thirteen
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 6 percent
drop, on average. The feedlot herd totaled 11.861 million
as of Jan. 1, up 3 percent from a year earlier and in line
with analyst expectations.  Parts of Texas,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas  received more
than twice the normal precipitation in December, according
to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .
Drought conditions in Texas, the biggest cattle-producing
state, are easing. Ranchers sold more cattle in November,
September, June and July than in the same months in 2010 as
the dryness in the Southern Plains damaged grazing areas.  “Moisture on the Southern Plains slowed the movement
of cattle, and overall cattle numbers tightening”
contributed to the drop in feedlot purchases last month,
Troy Vetterkind, the owner Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in
Chicago, said in an e-mail before the report.  About 32 percent of  Texas  was in  “exceptional” 
drought in the week ended Jan. 3, compared with 65 percent
at that level seven weeks earlier, according to the U.S.
Drought Monitor.  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The
cattle are fattened on corn for about four to five months
until they weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to
meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.796 million animals to
meatpackers last month, down 1.9 percent from a year
earlier, the USDA said. Analysts expected 2.8 percent
decline, on average.  Fattened cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.1
percent, to $1.27625 a pound at 12:56 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.29325,
the highest since the commodity began trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1964. That was the fifth
record this month. Before today, the commodity climbed 13
percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement fell 0.1
percent, to $1.538 a pound, after earlier touching
$1.55275, the highest ever. Prices rose 21 percent in the
12 months through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
