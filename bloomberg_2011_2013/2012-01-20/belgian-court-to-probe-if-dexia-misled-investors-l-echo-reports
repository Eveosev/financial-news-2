A Belgian court has opened a formal
investigation into whether  Dexia SA (DEXB)  misled investors on its
financial health prior to the decision in October to dismantle
the bank,  L’Echo  and De Tijd reported.  The investigation was opened by a court in Brussels in
response to a complaint registered on Nov. 9 by an association
representing some of the bank’s smaller shareholders, the
newspapers said, citing a court spokesman.  Dexia, once the world’s largest municipal lender, won
temporary approval last month from European Union regulators for
as much as 45 billion euros ($58 billion) in guarantees from
Belgium, France and Luxembourg through May 31 as the bank is
broken up along national lines and subsidiaries are sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
