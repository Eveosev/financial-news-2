The U.S. and its European allies are
blocking further negotiations on the Iranian nuclear dispute in
order to provoke an armed conflict,  Iran ’s ambassador to Russia
told reporters.  “They are using various excuses, including a failure of
the six-party talks with Iran, to start a new war,” Mahmoud-
Reza Sajjadi said at a press conference in Moscow today,
referring to negotiations with the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council -- the U.S.,  China , France,
Russia and the U.K. -- as well as  Germany .  The U.S. Navy’s deployment in the  Persian Gulf  is a
provocation, he added. “If Iran sees aggression from other
countries, it will resist, defend itself with all its might,”
he said.  Iran is willing to hold talks about its nuclear program in
Istanbul or elsewhere and has submitted suggestions on a
timetable to the international community, Iranian Foreign
Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  said yesterday after meeting Turkish
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul
in Ankara the day before.  European Union foreign ministers meet Jan. 23 to discuss an
oil embargo on Iran that may be delayed by six months to give
some members time to find alternate supplies.  Iranian officials have threatened to close the Strait of
Hormuz, the transit route for almost 20 percent of the world’s
oil, in the event of a blockade of oil shipments or military
strikes. Iran denies its nuclear program is aimed at
developing atomic weapons, saying it is for civilian purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
