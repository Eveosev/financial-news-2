Carnival Corp. (CCL) ’s Costa Crociere SpA
Chairman Pier Luigi Foschi said the captain of the Costa
Concordia ship that ran aground a week ago evacuated too late,
daily Il Corriere della Sera reported, citing an interview.  The delay was “unjustifiable” and no lives would have
been lost abandoning the ship earlier, Foschi said, according to
the newspaper. The company didn’t “reason in economic terms”
to delay an evacuation, the chairman added, according to
Corriere della Sera.  Ship captains have too much control and on-shore alarms
should be triggered when a ship goes off route, Foschi said,
according to the Italian newspaper. The company won’t pay for
the lawyer of Francesco Schettino, the captain, Foschi said in
the interview. He may have fallen into the lifeboat, but he
should have got back onto the ship, Foschi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
