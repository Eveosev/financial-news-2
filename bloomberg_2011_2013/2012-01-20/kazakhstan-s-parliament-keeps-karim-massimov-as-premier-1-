Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov
was reaffirmed at a parliamentary confidence vote today in the
capital, Astana.  Serik Akhmetov was promoted to first deputy prime minister
from deputy premier, according to President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s official website. He replaces Umirzak Shukeyev, who
was appointed head of the Samruk-Kazyna sovereign-wealth fund in
December.  Kairat Kelimbetov, who previously headed the ministry of
trade and economic development, was named deputy prime minister.
Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the former head of the Pavlodar region,
will take over as minister of trade and economic development.  Nazarbayev’s ruling Nur Otan party maintained its dominant
role in parliament, garnering 80.74 percent of the vote in a
Jan. 15 election. Kazakhstan suffered its worst violence in 20
years as oil workers in a region bordering the  Caspian Sea 
rioted last month, killing 16 people and leaving more than 100
injured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
