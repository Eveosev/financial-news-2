Contract talks with two unions
representing 242,000 letter carriers and mail handlers are at an
impasse and a mediator may be called in to resolve differences,
the U.S.  Postal Service  said.  Agreements with the National Association of Letter
Carriers, with 196,000 members, and the National Postal Handlers
Union and its 46,000 members expired in November. Talks were
extended twice, to Dec. 16 and then midnight tonight, according
to a Postal Service statement today.  Frederic Rolando, president of the letter-carriers union,
said negotiators had been making “steady progress.” He said he
is disappointed the Postal Service declined to extend talks and
declared an impasse, which triggers 60 days of mediation
followed by arbitration.  “We will pursue a negotiated agreement through mediation
and prepare to vigorously defend our members” in arbitration,
Rolando said in an e-mailed statement.  As a first step, the parties may seek mediation and, if the
effort fails, would ask an arbitrator to determine a final
resolution, the Postal Service said.  The existing contracts will be in effect until a new
agreement is reached. The workers are barred from walking out
because Congress has designated the Postal Service as essential
to the nation, according to the agency’s statement.  The letter carriers and mail-processing employees had wages
and benefits of $19.2 billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
