Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) , the
railroad under pressure from investor  William Ackman  to hire a
new chief executive officer, said some customers and
shareholders support its current CEO, Fred Green.  “Our shareholders recognize the operational and financial
changes we are making to enhance value,” Green said in a  letter 
to employees posted on the company’s website today. “We have
heard support for our plan from shareholders.”  Ackman,  Canadian Pacific ’s largest investor, disclosed his
stake in the Calgary-based company in October and has put naming
 Hunter Harrison  as CEO at the center of his turnaround plan for
the railroad. Canadian Pacific Chairman John Cleghorn rebuffed
Ackman’s push to replace Green with Harrison in a letter
released Jan. 9.  In today’s letter, Green also cited support for his
leadership from some of Canadian Pacific’s largest customers,
including  Teck Resources Ltd. (TECK/B)  and Mosaic Co.  “Fred Green understands that to grow the economy,
especially in Western Canada, we need to work together to get
the most out of the rail network,” Teck CEO Don Lindsay said in
the letter. “We are pleased with his leadership and support of
the team in making our joint growth targets achievable.”  Ackman, the founder of New York-based Pershing Square
Capital Management LP, invests in companies he deems undervalued
and seeks changes to improve shareholder returns.  Pershing didn’t respond to a phone call seeking comment.  Canadian Pacific  fell  1.4 percent to C$71.56 at the close
in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
