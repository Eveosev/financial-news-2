China â€™s inventory of hogs fell in
December for the first time in 10 months, according to the
Ministry of Agriculture.  The country had 473.34 million hogs at the end of December
as tracked by the ministry, a 0.61 percent decline from November,
according to the Jan. 17  statement . That is the first decline
since February of last year. On an annual basis, the inventory
of hogs in December increased 5.1 percent from a year earlier,
according to the statement.  A shortage of hogs in 2010 and early last year fueled
increases in pork prices and stoked inflation.  Food price  gains
accelerated in December from November for the first time in five
months, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
