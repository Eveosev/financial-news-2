The  International Monetary Fund 
postponed the first review of its loan program with Serbia
because of the Balkan nation’s 2012 budget plans.  “In particular, issuance of public debt and guarantees and
projected implementation of investment projects are in excess of
what would be consistent with program public deficit and debt
targets,” the Washington-based lender said in a statement
published on its website late yesterday.  Keeping the  budget deficit  within 4.25 percent of economic
output was agreed on with the IMF, which in September approved a
1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) precautionary loan for Serbia in
case  Europe ’s debt crisis triggers capital flight from the
Balkan economy, putting pressure on its currency and the balance
of payments. The government estimates a 4.5 percent deficit for
2011.  Serbia is emerging from its worst recession in a decade and
the government is trying to keep spending under control and
boost tax collection without cutting social benefits. The
government will increase subsidies this year for tourism,
agriculture, roads and railways and is keen on allowing a 5.5
percent annual increase in public wages and pensions affecting
as many as 2 million voters ahead of elections.  “Staff will continue discussions with the authorities with
a view to resuming the program once there is sufficient evidence
that the 2012 fiscal program is on track,” the IMF said.  The dinar fell to 105.187 against the euro at 11:09 a.m. in
Belgrade from 105.04 earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
