Pakistan ’s benchmark stock index
climbed to a two-month high on speculation the government may
review a tax on profits from share trading, a levy that has
shrunk volumes.  Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh will visit Karachi
Stock Exchange tomorrow, the bourse said in a statement today.
“We’re hopeful the issue will be resolved,” said Arif Habib, a
broker and former chairman of the exchange.  The benchmark  Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index  gained 2.2
percent to 11,772.98 at 1:36 p.m. local time, headed for its
highest close since Nov. 21. The gauge has risen 4.4 percent
this year, compared with a 5.6 percent drop in 2011.  Pakistan introduced a tax on  capital gains  made on share
purchases from July 1, 2010, that requires investors to pay a 10
percent levy if stocks are held for less than six months and 7.5
percent if held for six to 12 months. Average daily volume
slumped to 60 million shares last year from 108 million in 2010
and 169.14 million in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Karachi Stock Exchange has suggested that the two tax
slabs be cut to one flat rate, and that the levy be paid after
it is calculated and certified by the National Clearing Company
of Pakistan Ltd., according to Managing Director Nadeem Naqvi.
The suggestion is aimed at preventing investors from being
harassed by tax officials, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
