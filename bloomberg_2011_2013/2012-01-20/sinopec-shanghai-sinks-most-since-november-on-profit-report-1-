Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co. (338) ,
a unit of  China ’s largest oil refiner, fell the most in two
months in U.S. trading after saying that 2011 earnings probably
slid as much as 70 percent.  American depositary receipts  of Sinopec  Shanghai  declined
5.3 percent, the most since Nov. 9, to a 1 1/2-week low of
$36.84 in  New York . Each ADR represents 100 common shares in the
company.  The Shanghai-based subsidiary of  China Petroleum and
Chemical Corp ., known as Sinopec, said net income for 2011
probably fell 50 percent to 70 percent from 2010, according to a
statement yesterday to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The
forecast was based on preliminary estimates, the company said.  Sinopec Shanghai’s operational costs increased in 2011 due
to higher international crude prices while “domestic prices for
refined oil products weren’t adjusted in an adequate and timely
manner,” the company said in the statement. Demand for
petrochemical products also weakened in the fourth quarter,
Sinopec Shanghai said.  The  ADRs (SHI)  of its parent Sinopec also retreated, dropping 1.1
percent, the most in a week, to $117.84 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
