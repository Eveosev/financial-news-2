Crude-oil shipments aboard
supertankers bound for  Japan  rose 12 percent this week,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vessels with a total carrying capacity of 10.9 million
deadweight tons are heading for the Asian nation, up from 9.7
million tons last week. About 8.2 percent of the fleet of the
largest  oil tankers  signaling future destinations is bound for
Japan. The ships would haul about 79.7 million barrels of oil,
assuming a conversion factor of 7.33 barrels a ton.  The following table shows the destinations and combined
carrying capacity in deadweight tons of 434 very large crude
carriers, out of a global fleet of 563, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Average drafts are expressed as a
percentage of maximum sailing depth and are an indication of
cargo size. Each countryâ€™s percentage share of total oil
shipments is shown for the current and prior weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
