Lake Turkana Wind Power Ltd. , a
company set up to build what it says will be sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest wind farm, plans to start construction in
April, said Chairman Carlo van Wageningen.  The 300-megawatt project in northwest  Kenya  will cost 583
million euros ($756 million), Van Wageningen told reporters
today in Nairobi, the capital. About 70 percent of the funds
will be from debt and 30 percent from shareholders, he said.  “We believe that if all goes well, the first 50 megawatts
can be online by the fourth quarter of 2013,” and the rest by
the end of 2014, Van Wageningen said.  Kenya Power Ltd. (KPLL) , the east African nation’s monopoly power
distributor, has agreed to buy 300 megawatts of electricity over
two decades from the project in the country’s northwest.  The project will comprise 365  wind turbines , each with a
capacity of 850 kilowatts, installed on 40,000 acres, Van
Wageningen said. The company leased 150,000 acres of land in an
area with a capacity to produce 2,000 megawatts of wind power,
he said.  “Our intention will be to invest in the future as the
system grows and demand grows,” Van Wageningen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
