The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt fell, heading for the biggest weekly
declines since Dec. 2, according to traders of credit-default
swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased one
basis point to 645, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 12 p.m.
in London. The gauge is heading for a fifth weekly drop,
signaling improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 0.25 basis point to 151.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 2.5 basis points to 220.5 and
the subordinated index tumbled 14 to 406. The measures are
heading for a second weekly decline.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell four basis points to 340, the lowest since Dec.
7.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
