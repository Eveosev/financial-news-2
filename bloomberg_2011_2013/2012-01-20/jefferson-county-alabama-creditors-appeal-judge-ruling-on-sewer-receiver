Creditors of Jefferson County,
 Alabama (STOAL1) , appealed a ruling that revoked the power of a receiver
who had run an insolvent sewer system on behalf of bondholders
before the county filed the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy.  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , acting as trustee for sewer
bondholders, filed a notice of appeal today in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Birmingham, Alabama. The trustee now has 14 days to
explain why it thinks the ruling was incorrect, Bank of New
York’s attorney, Larry B. Childs, said in an interview.  “I would expect other parties in the case will also be
filing today,” he said.  The bankruptcy was filed after the county, state officials,
the receiver and bondholders failed to implement an agreement to
cut the sewer debt by about $1 billion, increase rates and
obtain help for the county from the  Alabama  Legislature.  County officials and the trustee for bondholders are in
talks on how much of the sewer system’s revenue must be turned
over to bondholders. The system doesn’t generate enough money to
cover the sewer warrants, according to court records.  The ruling effectively ended the control of John S. Young Jr. over the sewer system, which is owned by the county. Young
was appointed to run it by a state court judge a year before the
county filed bankruptcy.  Young also appealed the ruling, along with creditors Bank
of America NA and Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp.  The case is In re Jefferson County, 11-05736-9, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Alabama (Birmingham).  To contact the reporter on this story:
