Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN) ,  Europe ’s
largest maker of solar-panel equipment, fell the most in almost
six weeks in Zurich trading as Germany said it will cut solar
subsidies more frequently in an effort to slow installations
that reached a record last year.  Meyer Burger declined as much as 6.8 percent and traded at
at 17.85 Swiss francs at 12:01 p.m. in Zurich. That’s the
 biggest  intraday slump since Dec. 12 and gives the Baar,
Switzerland-based company a market value of about 847 million
francs ($905 million).  “Subsidy cuts put pressure on solar stocks as they can
have a negative impact, they tend to limit market growth, even
if they are economically justifiable,” said  Michael Foeth , an
analyst at Vontobel Holding AG in Zurich. “However, solar
stocks have risen very strongly in the past weeks so there’s
certainly a market correlation as well.”  Feed-in tariffs, or premium rates for electricity from
solar energy, will be reduced every month instead of twice a
year currently, German Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen
said yesterday.  The company’s shares have rallied 18 percent since Jan. 10
as  China  said it plans to develop 3 gigawatts of solar capacity
this year and amid rising polysilicon prices for material used
in the panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
