Banco do Brasil SA ,  Banco Bradesco
SA (BBDC4) ,  Caixa Economica Federal (CEFN3)  and  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  are in final
negotiations to create a company to link together and operate
their ATM machines,  Valor Economico  reported, citing
unidentified people involved in the talks.  The banks also plan to generate income by loaning the ATMs
to other financial institutions, according to the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper.  The new company, which is expected to begin operations in
the first half, will compete with Tecban SA, in which Banco do
Brasil, Bradesco and Santander hold a stake, Valor said.  Tecban declined to comment, according to Valor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
