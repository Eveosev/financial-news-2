Boeing Co. (BA) â€™s Seattle-area
manufacturing hub was recovering from power failures amid three
days of snow and ice that had shut one parts plant and two
office buildings next to the 737 factory.  The Frederickson plant, where 1,500 workers over three
shifts build parts including composite tail sections for the 787
Dreamliner, was set to re-open for the second shift this
afternoon, said  Marc Birtel , a company spokesman in Seattle. It
had been shut since yesterday morning.  Power was restored to offices housing engineers, supplier
management, security, site services and other groups around the
737 plant at about 11 a.m., said Cindy Wall, a spokeswoman for
the Chicago-based company.  Renton Municipal Airport, the airfield near the plant from
which all 737s make their maiden flights, re-opened today after
it was closed yesterday during an ice storm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
