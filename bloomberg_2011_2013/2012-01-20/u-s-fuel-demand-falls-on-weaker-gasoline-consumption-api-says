U.S. fuel demand dropped to a 15-
year low for the month of December as gasoline use fell, the
 American Petroleum Institute  said.  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, declined 5.9 percent to 18.6 million barrels a day last
month from a year earlier, the industry-funded group said today
in a report. Consumption for all of 2011 averaged 18.9 million
barrels a day, down 1.2 percent from 2010.  Gasoline use in December dropped 4.3 percent from a year
earlier to 8.53 million barrels a day. It was the lowest level
of December use for the motor fuel in 13 years.  “Gasoline demand tends to be tied closely to employment
and overall retail sales,” said  John Felmy , chief economist
with the Washington-based API. “Although employment has
improved a little bit, growth is still weak.”  Consumption of distillate fuels, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, fell 4.9 percent to 3.97 million barrels
a day in December.  Demand for ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, climbed 2 percent to 3.46 million barrels a day, the
report showed.  Jet-fuel use rose 7.1 percent to 1.48 million barrels a day
last month from a year earlier.  U.S. crude-oil production gained 0.5 percent to 5.53
million barrels a day in December, the department said. Output
in the lower 48 states advanced 0.3 percent to 4.91 million
barrels a day. Alaskan production increased 1.6 percent to
622,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
