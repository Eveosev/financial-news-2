European governments need to make a
decision on whether to enact a common financial transaction tax
to bring clarity to markets, Bundesbank Board member Andreas Dombret said.  “If not introduced globally -- or at least at the most
important financial centers -- such a tax would set incentives
to relocate either parts of the business or firms altogether,”
Dombret said according to the text of speech delivered at a
conference in Berlin today.  “In turn, actual revenues generated by the tax will
probably be lower than projected and competition between
financial centers be distorted,” he said. “I urge the
governments to make final decisions regarding a financial
transaction tax as the market place would benefit from clarity
on this issue.”  The European Commission in September suggested a tax of 0.1
percent on equity and bond transactions and 0.01 percent on
derivatives, which it said could raise 55 billion euros ($71
billion) a year. European Union finance ministers are due to
discuss the levy in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
