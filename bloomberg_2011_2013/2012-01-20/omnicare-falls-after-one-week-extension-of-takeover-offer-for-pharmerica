Omnicare Inc. (OCR)  fell as much as 5.9
percent after the company’s $440.8 million takeover offer for
drug-supply company PharMerica was extended a week.  Omnicare dropped 2.3 percent to $33.35 at 11:25 a.m. in New
York. The shares of the Covington, Kentucky-based company
earlier declined to $32.12. PharMerica fell 2.6 percent.  The $15-a-share unsolicited bid will expire at the end of
the trading day on Jan. 27 instead of today, Omnicare said in a
statement yesterday. Omnicare, in a filing earlier this month,
said it agreed not to complete the offer before Jan. 26 unless
the Federal Trade Commission notified the company that its
regulatory review is finished.  “It looks like they’re still struggling with the FTC
review,” said  Jeff Jonas , an analyst with Gabelli & Co. in
Rye, New York, with a “hold” rating on Omnicare. “It’s
probably a bad sign.”  If anything else happens, Omnicare will make it public,
said Jamie Moser, an outside spokeswoman. Omnicare declined to
make further comment, she said.  PharMerica doesn’t take part in the discussions between the
FTC and Omnicare and doesn’t have any details, said Meghan Stafford, a company spokeswoman.  PharMerica, based in Louisville,  Kentucky , fell 35 cents to
$12.93.  The deal may enable Omnicare to control as much as 60
percent of the market to distribute drugs to nursing homes,
hospitals and hospices, Jonas has said. The offer has a value of
$716 million including net debt, Omnicare said when announcing
the takeover bid in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
