Investors based in  North America 
were the biggest overseas net buyers of Japanese stocks last
year, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Investors based in North America bought 1 trillion yen ($13
billion) more shares than they sold on Japan’s exchanges in 2011,
the country’s biggest bourse said today. The amount accounted
for half the total net purchases of Japanese stocks by overseas
investors last year.  Net purchases by investors based in the U.S declined 38
percent in 2011 from a year earlier, while those in  Europe  fell
56 percent to 460.9 billion yen. Net purchase by Asian investors
rose 35 percent to 532.1 billion yen.  Foreigners in each of the regions bought more Japanese
shares than they sold for a third year running, the data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
