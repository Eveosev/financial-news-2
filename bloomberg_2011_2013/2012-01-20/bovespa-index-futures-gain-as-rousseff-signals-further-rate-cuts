Bovespa futures advanced, a sign the
equity gauge may extend a third weekly gain, after a report that
President  Dilma Rousseff  wants the central bank to keep lowering
borrowing boosted the outlook for companies that sell in the
local market.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  may move after it said in a
regulatory filing yesterday 2011 average oil and gas production
reached a record-high 2.38 million barrels per day. Pulp maker
 Suzano Papel & Celulose SA  may be active after saying it
estimates it will invest 4 billion reais ($2.27 billion) this
year and 2.2 billion reais in 2013, according to a presentation
sent to  Brazil ’s securities regulator.  Bovespa futures climbed 0.1 percent to 62,235 at 10:44 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. The real rose 0.1 percent to 1.7635 per  U.S.
dollar .  Rousseff wants the central bank to cut the benchmark Selic
rate by at least a further 1 percentage point in 2012 so it ends
the year at 9.5 percent, O Globo reported, citing unidentified
people. Rousseff is prepared to make fiscal adjustments to help
the central bank achieve this goal, according to the Rio de
Janeiro-based newspaper.  “It’s becoming clearer and clearer that the main goal of
this administration is to boost growth, no matter what,”
Rogerio Freitas, a partner at hedge fund Teorica Investimentos,
said by phone from  Rio de Janeiro .  The Bovespa has advanced 27 percent from a two-year low on
Aug. 8, buoyed by Brazil’s interest-rate cuts and signs of
progress in solving  Europe ’s debt crisis. The gauge trades at
9.3 times analysts’ earnings estimates, which compares with the
ratio of 9.6 for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21 developing nations’

benchmark equity gauge sank 18 percent in 2011.  Traders moved 7.02 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
