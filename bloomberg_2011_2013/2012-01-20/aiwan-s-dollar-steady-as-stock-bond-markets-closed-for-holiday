Taiwan ’s dollar’s dollar dropped,
snapping a three-day gain, as government reports showed factory
output and export orders fell more than economists estimated.  Industrial  production  shrank 8.15 percent last month from a
year earlier, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said in Taipei.
That was the biggest contraction since August 2009 and compares
with the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey for a
6.6 percent drop. Export  orders  fell 0.72 percent in the same
period, exceeding a 0.5 percent decline forecast by economists.  “In terms of growth around the region, Taiwan looks to be
one of the more affected economies by what’s happening in other
parts of the world and this data certainly isn’t helping,” said
 Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at Westpac Banking
Corp. in  Singapore .  The  Taiwan dollar  slipped 0.2 percent to NT$29.990 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.86 yesterday, the strongest level since Oct. 31. The
island’s stock and bond markets are closed through Jan. 27 for
the Chinese New Year holidays.  “It’s very quiet today,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency
trader at Union Bank of Taiwan in Taipei. “Looking forward, the
Taiwan dollar should remain at the current level and hover
around NT$30.”  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.41 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
