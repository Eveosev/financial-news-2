Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  will stick with a
smaller board for now following the death of Steve Jobs, its
largest stockholder, and two departures.  Disney, based in Burbank,  California , proposed 10 current
directors for re-election at the company’s annual meeting set
for Tuesday, March 13, in Kansas City, Missouri, according to a
regulatory  filing  today.  The world’s biggest theme park operator is preparing for
the departure of Chairman John E. Pepper, 73, who plans to hand
over that role to Chief Executive Officer  Robert Iger  at the
meeting. Iger will hold both titles as part of the company’s
plan to appoint a new CEO in 2015. Iger, 60, received 2011
compensation of $33.4 million, up from $29.6 million a year
earlier, according to the filing.  Disney, also owner of the ABC broadcast network and the
ESPN cable channel, fell 0.3 percent to $39.31 in New York
trading. The shares were little changed last year.  John Bryson 
left the board in October to become U.S. Commerce Secretary.  The Steven P. Jobs trust owns 137.3 million Disney  shares ,
or almost 8 percent of the total, according the filing. The
shares are worth $5.4 billion. Previous filings listed him as
holding 138 million.  Iger’s 2011 pay included almost $2 million in salary, stock
awards of $8.1 million, option awards of $4.8 million and a
bonus of $15.5 million. A change in the value of his pension
contributed $2.07 million and other pay added almost $1 million
to the total.  In November, Disney raised its annual dividend by 50
percent to 60 cents a share, the biggest increase in at least 20
years, after the company reported record fiscal 2011 revenue and
profit.  In addition to Iger, those up for election are: Susan Arnold, John Chen, Judith Estrin, Fred Langhammer, Aylwin Lewis,
Monica Lozano, Robert Matschullat,  Sheryl Sandberg  and Orin Smith.  To contact the reporter on this story:
