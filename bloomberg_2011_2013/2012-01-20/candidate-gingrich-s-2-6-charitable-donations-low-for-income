Republican presidential candidate
 Newt Gingrich  and his wife reported giving 2.6 percent of their
$3.1 million adjusted gross income to charity in 2010, below the
average donation level of taxpayers at their income level,
according to Internal Revenue Service data.  The Gingriches reported $81,133 in charitable donations,
according to tax documents they released Jan. 19. The sole named
benefactor, the Basilica of the National Shrine in Washington,
received $9,540, and it paid wife Callista Gingrich $5,918. She
is a member of the choir. Another $68,493 in charitable
deductions were listed as gifts from Gingrich’s companies to
unidentified charities. The rest, $3,100, was labeled
miscellaneous donations.  Gingrich, a former U.S. House speaker who in recent years
has worked as a health care and housing industry consultant, is
the first of the four remaining 2012 Republican presidential
contenders to release tax returns. Gingrich provided his 2010
forms. He hasn’t said whether he’ll release those from other
years.  Previous presidential candidates -- including Democrats
 Barack Obama  and  Al Gore  -- have faced criticism that they
didn’t contribute enough to charity.  Russell James, director of a graduate program in charitable
financial planning at  Texas  Tech University in Lubbock, Texas,
said while Gingrich’s level of giving “isn’t shockingly low,”
research shows older, conservative Americans typically are among
the most generous with donations. Gingrich, 68, has described
himself as the true conservative in the Republican primary
field.  Tax Benefits  “Someone with his political philosophy, you would expect
to be on the very high end of giving,” James said.
Conservatives “tend to be more churchgoing and believe that
others outside of the government should take care of people.”  Charitable giving doesn’t just warm the heart, it provides
a tax break.  U.S. taxpayers with income of between $2 million and $5
million a year on average donated 3.5 percent of their adjusted
gross income, according to 2009 IRS data, the most recent
figures available. The average for all taxpayers is 3 percent,
the data show.  “The obvious advantage to charity is it’s deductible,”
 Roberton Williams , a senior fellow at the  Tax Policy Center  in
Washington, said in an interview yesterday. “It reduces your
taxable income, meaning the cost of giving away a dollar is
substantially less than a dollar.” R.C. Hammond, Gingrich’s
spokesman, didn’t return a phone call or e-mail yesterday.  ‘Values’  Gingrich said at the CNN debate on Jan. 19 that he released
his 2010 tax forms “so that people can see what we do and how
we did it and what our values are.”  His joint filing with Callista Gingrich gives no indication
which charities other than the National Shrine benefited from
donations.  A separate tax document released Jan. 19 for The Gingrich
Foundation provides a list of donation recipients.  The foundation, based in  Washington , received $152,609 in
contributions in 2010 -- it doesn’t list donors -- and provided
$120,000 to 14 organizations. Luther College in  Iowa , Callista
Gingrich’s alma mater, received the most, $30,000. The National
Shrine received $20,000. Smaller amounts went to the Mount
Vernon Association, the Washington National Opera and the
Atlanta Ballet, according to the tax returns.  Most presidential candidates since the 1970s have released
tax returns, and some have been criticized for below-average
giving.  Previous Giving  In 1997, then-Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat who ran
for president in 2000, donated $353 of his $197,729 earnings. He
bumped up his giving to $15,197 the next year.  The Obamas donated less than 1 percent of their income from
2000 through 2004 and 5 percent of the money they made in 2005
and 2006, according to the tax returns they released. Vice
President  Joe Biden  and his wife reported in 2008 giving an
average of $369 to charity each year for a decade -- less than 1
percent of their income.  Republican  Richard Nixon , well-known for penny-pinching,
reported donating $295 in 1972 while he was president, according
to presidential tax returns archived on the Tax Analysts’ Tax
History Project website.  While Gingrich’s giving might be on the low side, James
said, fellow presidential contender Mitt Romney’s donations to
the Mormon Church may dominate the charity storyline of this
year’s presidential election. Romney, the former Massachusetts
governor who has made millions of dollars as a co-founder of
Boston private-equity firm Bain Capital LLC, reported in a
financial disclosure form filed in August with the  Federal
Election Commission  that his assets are worth as much as $250
million. The Mormon Church asks its members to donate at least
10 percent of their income.  Romney said Jan. 19 that he will release his most recent
tax returns in April. Fellow Republicans including New Jersey
Governor  Chris Christie  have asked him to do so sooner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
