U.S.  sugar imports  from  Mexico , the
world’s sixth-largest producer, may fall to as low as 800,000
tons this season as the worst drought on record hurt crops.  Mexican sugar mills “signed contracts to export 800,000
tons of sugar this year to the U.S.,” Juan Cortina Gallardo,
the president of the nation’s Sugar and Alcohol Chamber of
Commerce, said in a phone interview today.  Mexico exported 1.42 million tons the previous crop season,
according to the  Agriculture Ministry . The U.S. buys about 99
percent of Mexico’s sugar exports, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture .  Accumulated sugar production this crop year fell 14 percent
to 1.1 million tons last week compared with the same period the
previous year, according to a Jan. 14 chamber report. Drought
caused by the La Nina weather pattern in northern Mexico is
harming crops and driving up prices for some of those products.  “Traders may buy 200,000 tons of additional Mexican sugar
to export to the U.S., but for us the most important issue is to
cover domestic demand,” said Cortina.  Mexican sugar production for this crop year may range
between 5.05 and 5.1 million tons, said Cortina. A new estimate
by the industry will be set next week, he said.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 1.1 percent to close at
24.89 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The price
posted a weekly gain of 4.4 percent, the most since Oct. 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
