Societe Generale SA (GLE) ’s director of
exchange-traded products John Craven has left the French bank,
Citywire  reported  without saying where it got the information.  Craven, who joined in August 2010 to help develop SocGen’s
structured products business, left to pursue opportunities
outside banking, according to the news service.  Craven joined the Paris-based lender from Merrill Lynch &
Co., where he was head of retail structured products and capital
markets for Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa, Citywire said.  SocGen spokeswoman Ila Kotecha in London declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
