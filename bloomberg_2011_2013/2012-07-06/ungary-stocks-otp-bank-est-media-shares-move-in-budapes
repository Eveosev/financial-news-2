The benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index fell 1.3
percent to 17,096.31 by the close in Budapest, capping a 1.4
percent decline this week.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  ,  Hungary ’s largest lender, fell 0.6
percent to 3,540 forint, bringing its weekly decline to 0.8
percent. Slower-than-forecast growth in U.S. payrolls fueled
concern the economic recovery is slowing.  Est Media Vagyonkezelo Nyrt. (ESTMEDIA HB), a Hungarian
entertainment company, fell 14 percent to 24 forint, a record
low. The company has slid 37 percent this week after saying it
offered to sell a stake in Hungary’s biggest outdoor music
festival following a failed bond sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
