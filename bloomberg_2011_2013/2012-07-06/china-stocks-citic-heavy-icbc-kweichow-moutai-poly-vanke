Shares of the following companies had
 unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
and prices are as of the close in  Shanghai .  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, advanced 1 percent to 2,223.58, the
biggest gain in a week. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  surged 1.7 percent to
2,472.61.  Banking stocks:  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. 
(601398 CH), the nation’s biggest listed lender, fell 1 percent
to 3.91  yuan .  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  (601939 CH), the
second largest, lost 0.7 percent to 4.16 yuan.  The People’s Bank of China announced yesterday it will
lower the one-year lending rate by 0.31 percentage point
effective today, more than the 0.25 percentage point cut in the
one-year deposit rate announced on the same day.  The rate cut will cut banks’ profits by 6 percent, Tracy Yu

dated yesterday. Banks’ average profits may drop 10 percent next
year at best and 54 percent at worst, May Yan, an analyst at
Barclays Plc, wrote in a note.  Consumer stocks:  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519)  (600519 CH), China’s
biggest producer of baijiu liquor by market value, rose 3.3
percent to 259.99 yuan, a record close. Wuliangye Yibin Co.
(000858 CH), the second largest, advanced 7.6 percent to 35.01
yuan, the biggest jump since November 2009.  Investors should get defensive and move out of stocks that
are most tied to economic growth if the interest-rate cut
triggers a technical rebound, Hao Hong, Hong Kong-based head of
Chinese research at Bank of Communications Co., wrote in a note

largest, gained 5 percent to 12.82 yuan. China Merchants
Property Development Co. (000024 CH), the third biggest, climbed
5 percent to 26.29 yuan.  The rate cut will benefit property stocks in the near term
as investors and speculators re-enter the market,  Du Jinsong , an
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in e-mailed comments.  Citic Heavy Industries Co. (601608)  (601608 CH), the heavy machinery
unit of China’s largest conglomerate, gained 2.6 percent from
its offer price to 4.79 yuan on the first day of trading in
