Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. (JI) , the
second-largest drip irrigation company in the world, won
regulatory approval from  India  for a non-banking lending venture
with the World Bank’s International Finance Corp.  The shares climbed as much as 5.4 percent, the most in
seven weeks, after India’s biggest irrigation company announced
the RBI’s approval of the venture to loan to farmers seeking
private-sector financing of agricultural and water needs.  Loans will be targeted to small farm and rural ventures to
increase water-use efficiency including micro-irrigation systems
and plastic pipes and agricultural production as well as for
solar pumps. The joint venture will be based in Mumbai and start
operations after the monsoon season, Jalgaon, India-based Jain
said today in a statement.  Netafim Ltd. of  Israel  is the largest micro-irrigation
equipment maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
