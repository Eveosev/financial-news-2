Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said the government will give regulators more power to
monitor complaints by consumers against banks.  The government will enact regulations requiring banks to
belong to federally approved external complaints bodies, and
giving the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada the authority to
monitor and enforce compliance, the Department of Finance said
in a statement on its website.  The rules will set requirements for the complaints bodies
in terms of independence, timeliness and transparency, according
to the statement. The regulations will be published July 13 for
a 30-day comment period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
