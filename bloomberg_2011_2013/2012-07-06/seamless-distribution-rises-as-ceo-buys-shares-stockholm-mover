Seamless Distribution AB (SEAM) , a Swedish
developer of software for mobile payment solutions, rose the
most in six weeks after Peter Fredell, the company’s Chief
Executive Officer purchased additional shares.  Fredell bought 1.14 million shares by exercising options,
raising his stake in the Stockholm-based company to about 16
percent, Seamless said in a statement today. Retailers have
received SEQR, the company’s mobile payment solution with
“enthusiasm,” Fredell said. “I see significant potential in
the company,” he added.  The stock was up 11 percent, or 1.4 kronor, to 14.1 kronor
as of 9:05 a.m. in the Swedish capital, valuing the company at
333 million kronor ($48 million.) The shares have tripled in
value since November, when the company introduced the SEQR
mobile transaction solution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
