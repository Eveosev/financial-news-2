Indonesia’s rupiah headed for a
second week of gains after global funds bought the nation’s
assets on expectation central banks in the world’s largest
economies would ease monetary policy.  Government bonds  rallied
for a seventh straight week.  Overseas investors added 2.48 trillion rupiah ($264 million)
to their government  bond holdings  in the first two days of this
week, the most since the five days ended April 6, and purchased
$165 million more local stocks than they sold this week through
yesterday,  finance ministry  and exchange data show. The  European
Central Bank  cut its  reference rate  to a record low yesterday
and the People’s Bank of  China  reduced borrowing costs.  “We see greater confidence in the Indonesia markets,”
said Rully Nova, a currency analyst at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara
1906 in Jakarta. “Global stimulus measures would be positive
for Indonesia and for the rupiah as it would increase liquidity
in the market.”  The rupiah gained 0.3 percent this week to 9,405 per dollar
as of 4:11 p.m. in Jakarta, poised for its biggest weekly gain
since the five days ended June 15, according to prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 9,334 on
July 4, the strongest level since June 7, and weakened 0.2
percent today.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, declined 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 8.25 percent, the lowest level since May 15.  Bank  Indonesia ’s focus is now on keeping the rupiah stable,
from countering slowing global growth since last year, Perry Warjiyo, director for economic and monetary-policy research,
said today.  The government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022 advanced,
pushing the yield down 11 basis points this week, or 0.11
percentage point, to 6.05 percent, according to prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association. The yield reached 6.03 percent
yesterday, the lowest level since May 3, and climbed one basis
point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
