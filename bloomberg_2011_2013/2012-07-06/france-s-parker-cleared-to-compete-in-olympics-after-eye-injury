Tony Parker  was cleared to play on
the French national basketball team in the London Olympics after
suffering an eye injury as a bystander to a nightclub brawl in
New York, the team said in a statement on its website.  Parker, a guard who plays for the National Basketball
Association’s San Antonio Spurs, underwent surgery after a shard
of glass penetrated his left eye when the entourages of hip-hop
artists Drake and  Chris Brown  clashed last month in Manhattan.  A four-time All-Star and three-time NBA champion, Parker
has averaged 16.8 points and 5.9 assists per game in his 11-year  career, spent entirely with the Spurs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
