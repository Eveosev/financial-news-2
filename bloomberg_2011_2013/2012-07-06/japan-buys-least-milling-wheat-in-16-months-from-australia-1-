Japan  bought 60,175 metric tons of
milling wheat from  Australia  in a regular tender today, the
smallest volume in almost 16 months, according to the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  Shipment for the Australian grain, or Standard White wheat,
that is used to make noodles in Japan is set from Sept. 1 to
Sept. 30, Toshiki Tojo at the ministryâ€™s grain-trade division
said by phone. It was the smallest purchase since March 17 last
year, when the government bought 32,381 tons.  The agriculture ministry controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply. It has bought 1.35
million tons through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared
with 4.65 million tons in the year ended March 31.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
