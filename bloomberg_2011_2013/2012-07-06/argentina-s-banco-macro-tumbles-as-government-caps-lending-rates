Banco Macro SA (BMA) , Argentina’s largest
lender by market share, dropped the most over two days in almost
three months as the government capped  interest rates  on loans.  Banco Macro retreated 1.7 percent to 8.10 pesos at the
close in  Buenos Aires , extending its two-day decrease to 8.9
percent, the biggest since April 17.  “It’s a bad sign as it’s the first time the central bank
uses its new charter that allows it to fix rates,” Juan Jose Vazquez, an analyst at Bull Market Brokers SA, said in a phone
interview from Buenos Aires. “There’s a bit of an overreaction
because banks are showing strong growth in deposits and the
loans won’t represent a big part of their capital base.”  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said in a July 4
speech that she will force the nation’s leading banks including
the local units of Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc to lend
to companies at a maximum rate of 400 basis points over the
badlar, a 30-day deposit rate that provides a benchmark for
loans. Badlar averaged 12.1 percent in June, about half the 24
percent annual inflation rate estimated by economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
