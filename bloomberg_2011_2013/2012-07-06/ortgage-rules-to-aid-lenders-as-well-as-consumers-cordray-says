U.S. mortgage-application rules to be
released by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will yield
benefits for both borrowers and lenders, CFPB Director  Richard
Cordray  said in a CNBC television interview.  Paperwork-reduction measures planned by the bureau, which
was created under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, will be designed to
“cut red tape” and ensure homeowners are better able to
“navigate and understand their choices,” Cordray said today.  “The rules we’re writing here will be good for industry
and for consumers because they should allow people to be able to
feel that it’s a reliable market,” said Cordray, who sued
mortgage lenders over allegations of fraudulent foreclosure
practices while serving as  Ohio ’s attorney general. “That
should all be good for participation in the long term here.”  The consumer bureau will complete proposals for simplifying
the mortgage-application process “this summer” with an eye
toward completing new rules by January, he said.  Lenders must work with the CFPB to improve access to credit
for borrowers as banks return to profitability in the wake of
the subprime mortgage crisis, Cordray said.  “It doesn’t help to protect consumers if they can’t get a
loan,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
