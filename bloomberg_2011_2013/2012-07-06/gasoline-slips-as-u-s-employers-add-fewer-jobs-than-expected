Gasoline futures slid as U.S.
employers added fewer jobs than projected in June, increasing
concerns that the country’s economic recovery is stalling and
fuel demand won’t improve.  Prices fell for the first time in three days as Labor
Department figures showed June payrolls climbed 80,000 after a
77,000 increase in May. Economists projected a 100,000 gain,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Private employers, which excludes government agencies, added
84,000 workers in June, the fewest in 10 months.  “This is a terrible number,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “There’s
nothing good about it. It’s the type of number that would
suggest the  U.S. economy  is slipping back into recession.”  August-delivery gasoline declined 4.88 cents, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $2.716 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures slipped 0.4 percent this week, and are up 1.1
percent this year. The contract is for reformulated gasoline, or
RBOB, delivered into  New York  Harbor.  Prices fell as low as $2.7115 after the dollar touched a
two-year high against the euro, reducing the investment appeal
of commodities.  “The market is nervous about the euro making new lows and
that may be spooking some investors,” said  Andrew Lebow , a
senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.  Unemployment Rate  The  unemployment rate  held at 8.2 percent. Joblessness has
exceeded 8 percent since February 2009, the longest such stretch
since monthly records began in 1948. The so-called
underemployment rate -- which includes part-time workers who’d
prefer a full-time position and people who want work but have
given up looking -- increased to 14.9 percent from 14.8 percent.  “The employment figures show growth in the U.S. is going
to continue to be at a very slow pace, and that would dampen
enthusiasm for oil demand,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline this week swung between a low of $2.57 on July 2
and a high of $2.795 yesterday. The high occurred after  Brent
crude  gained when Norway’s largest oil producer said a strike
forced a production halt and the Energy Department reported that
gasoline  demand  climbed 1.8 percent last week.  The low followed reports from the U.S.,  China  and  Europe 
that signaled a slowing global economy. The  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  factory index  for the U.S. slid to 49.7 in June
from 53.5 in May, the first contraction since July 2009. Chinese
manufacturing indexes dropped to seven-month lows and euro-area
 unemployment  reached a record in May.  IMF Forecast  The  International Monetary Fund  will reduce its estimate
for global growth this year on weakness in investment, jobs and
manufacturing in Europe, the U.S., Brazil, India and China,
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said.  “The market is just in a big trading range,” Lebow said.
“There are a lot of crosscurrents and every other report has
led to a confirmation of the lower-growth scenario.”  August gasoline strengthened versus the September contract
and versus crude oil in New York as Energy Department data
released yesterday showed that East Coast stockpiles of gasoline
fell to a seven-month low in the week ended June 29. Supplies
are the lowest for this time of year since at least 1990, based
on weekly data.  The premium of August over September futures jumped to
11.34 cents a gallon from 10.96 cents yesterday. The fuel’s
premium to WTI crude, or the crack spread, based on August
contracts,  widened  72 cents to $29.62 a barrel on the Nymex.  “This is reflective of very tight inventories of RBOB in
the Northeast,” Lipow said.  Heating oil for August delivery fell 5.85 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.7099 a gallon. Prices advanced 0.5 percent this
week and are down 7.7 percent in 2012.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 2 cents to $3.358 a gallon yesterday, according to
AAA. That’s the fourth consecutive increase. Prices are down 15
percent from a year-to-date high of $3.936 on April 4 and are
5.9 percent below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
