Gansu province  in northwest  China 
plans to send 100,000 chickens into pastureland this summer to
fight a plague of locusts, Xinhua News Agency said, citing the
provincial agricultural and stock breeding department.  Insect pests infest at least 1.33 million hectares of
pastureland in Gansu every year, and pilot chicken programs
since 2010 have been successful, Xinhua said. The province has
about 18 million hectares of pastures, covering about 40 percent
of its area, the official news service said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
