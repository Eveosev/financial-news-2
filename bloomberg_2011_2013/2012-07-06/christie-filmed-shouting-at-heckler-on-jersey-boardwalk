New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
was filmed shouting at a detractor yesterday on the Seaside
Heights boardwalk and the footage was posted to gossip website
 TMZ.com .  The Republican, who has made it clear he’s no fan of the
“ Jersey Shore ” reality-show cast for what he says is loud and
obnoxious behavior, was seen in the 29-second video in a heated
exchange with a person who criticized his education policies,
the website reported.  Christie, who clutches an ice cream cone during the video,
was with his family on the boardwalk, TMZ reported. The
governor, 49, at one point marches toward the critic as an
entourage follows him.  “You’re a real big shot -- keep shooting your mouth off,”
Christie, who travels with a cadre of state troopers, tells the
man. “You’re a real big shot. Keep walking away. Big shot.”  Michael Drewniak , a spokesman for Christie, didn’t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.  Christie, who took office in January 2010, has said he once
asked  New York  Governor  Andrew Cuomo  to take back the cast of
the “Jersey Shore,” which he said is made up of New York
residents who reinforce the worst stereotypes of the Jersey
Shore as a playground.  To contact the reporter on this story:
