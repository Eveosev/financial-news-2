Belgium ’s federal government will
need to save an additional 78 million euros ($96 million) to
reach its deficit target this year, Belga newswire reported,
citing Budget Minister Olivier Chastel.  The figure doesn’t take into account any additional
spending that might be approved during a budget meeting at the
end of next week, Belga quoted Chastel as saying. Prime Minister
Elio Di Rupo’s government will also have to decide whether to
unblock 650 million euros of planned expenditure that was frozen
at the start of the year to win a reprieve from European Union
sanctions, according to the newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
