China’s stocks fell for a third day
on concern the nation’s economic slowdown is deepening,
overshadowing the central bank’s second interest-rate cut in a
month.  The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 5.9 points, or 0.3
percent, to 2,195.40 at 10:33 a.m. local time, erasing a gain of
as much as 0.4 percent. The CSI 300 Index lost 0.1 percent to
2,429.21, led by energy and material companies. China Vanke Co.
surged 2.7 percent and property developers rallied on the
prospect lower borrowing costs will stimulate housing demand.
China Construction Bank Corp. fell 1 percent on concern bank net
interest margins will narrow, hurting earnings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
