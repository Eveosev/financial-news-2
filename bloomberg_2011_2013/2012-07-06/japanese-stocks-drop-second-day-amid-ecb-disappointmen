Japanese stocks dropped a second day,
with the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  trimming a weekly gain, as
rate cuts in Europe and China failed to boost investor
confidence before a U.S. jobs report today.  JX Holdings Inc. (5020)  paced declines among energy companies
after crude prices fell amid concern economic growth is slowing.
 GS Yuasa Corp. (6674)  sank 5.8 percent after  Barclays Capital  said
fewer orders from Mitsubishi Motors Corp. may hurt the battery
business.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) , Japan’s third-largest line
by sales, paced gains after a gauge of cargo rates climbed to a
seven-week high.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent to close at 9,020.75 in
Tokyo, paring a fifth week of gains to 0.2 percent. The broader
Topix Index slid 0.6 percent to 771.83. The  European Central
Bank  and People’s Bank of China yesterday cut their benchmark
borrowing costs, while the  Bank of England  increased its bond-
buying program.  “The rate cuts have an announcement effect and they send a
message that the authorities care about the economy, but the
moves aren’t necessarily going to improve the macro-economic
statistics,” said Ichiro Takamatsu, a  fund manager  at Tokyo-
based Bayview Asset Management Co., which overseas about $1.9
billion.  The Topix has rebounded about 11 percent since June 4, when
the index fell to its lowest level since 1983. Stocks rose after
Greek voters elected pro-bailout parties and European leaders
struck deals to contain the debt crisis.  U.S. Jobs  Shares on the Japanese benchmark trade at an average of 1.1
times book value, compared with 2.2 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than value of their assets.  Futures on  S&P 500 Index  fell 0.1 percent today. The gauge
slid 0.5 percent yesterday in New York, halting a three-day
advance, as investors awaited Labor Department data expected to
show the pace of hiring remained at less than half the average
for the first quarter of the year.  “The global economy is slowing down,” said Kenichi Kubo,
a senior fund manager at Tokio Marine Asset Management Co.,
which oversees 5.6 trillion yen ($70 billion). “Investors are
reluctant to buy shares until there’s bottoming-out signals
showing up in the data.”  Energy Shares  Energy companies declined after crude oil for August
delivery fell 0.5 percent to $87.22 a barrel yesterday in New
York and extended its drop today. JX, Japan’s biggest oil
refiner, lost 2.5 percent to 391 yen. Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K.
slipped 0.9 percent to 464 yen.  GS Yuasa tumbled 5.8 percent to 343 yen after Barclays cut
the battery maker’s rating to underweight from equal-weight and
reduced the share’s target price to 330 yen from 420 yen.
Slumping sales at Mitsubishi Motors may hurt business, Barclays
said.  Declines in Japanese stocks were limited as shipping lines
advanced after the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of cargo rates
for commodities, jumped 3.2 percent yesterday to its highest
close since May 21. Kawasaki Kisen rose 0.8 percent to 131 yen.
Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s largest shipping line by sales, added
0.5 percent to 209 yen.  -- With Assistance from Adam Haigh in Tokyo. Editors: Jason
