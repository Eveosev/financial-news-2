India ’s 10-year  bonds  advanced the
most in two weeks on optimism demand for the notes will
increase, spurred by more cash in the financial system.  Lenders  borrowed  115.3 billion rupees ($2.1 billion) from
the central bank’s repurchase auction window today, the least
since October, according to  Reserve Bank  of India data. The
 finance ministry  is scheduled to redeem 140 billion rupees of
securities on July 18, according to budget documents. Local
banks may buy 350 billion rupees of government debt this month
to meet bond-reserve requirements, according to a research note
from Barclays Plc.  “While we had been looking for the RBI to allow liquidity
easing for some time, the sharp drop in repo borrowing comes as
a surprise to us and the markets,” Barclays analysts including
Singapore-based Kumar Rachapudi wrote in the note released
today. “We continue to advocate being long on 10-year
 government bonds .”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.16 percent  in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That was
the biggest drop in more than two weeks. The rate fell two basis
points this week.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell four basis
points to 7.74 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
rate fell seven basis points this week.  The central bank sold 150 billion rupees of bonds due in
2020, 2026, 2032 and 2041 today, as planned. The sale was part
of the government’s record 5.69 trillion rupees borrowing
program for the fiscal year that began April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
