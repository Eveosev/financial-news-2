Crude-oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures dropped as much as 3.4 percent after a report
that U.S. employers added fewer workers than projected in June.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 32.4 percent at 1:25 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 34.5 percent yesterday.  “Initial reaction was higher in volatility, but we’re off
the lows now and the market could be a little bit range-bound,”
said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in
 New York .  Crude oil for August delivery fell $2.32, or 2.7 percent,
to $84.90 a barrel on the Nymex at 1:29 p.m., after touching
$84.26.  Futures declined as Labor Department figures showed June
payrolls climbed 80,000. Economists projected a 100,000 gain,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
Institute for Supply management reported earlier this week that
June  service industries activity  slowed to 52.1 from 53.7 while
the ISM’s factory index fell to 49.7 percent from 53.5 percent
in May, the first contraction since July 2009.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $105 calls, which fell 18 cents to 24 cents a barrel
at 1:34 p.m. with 1,378 lots trading. August $75 puts were the
second-most active options, with 1,360 lots changing hands as
they rose 1 cent to 7 cents.  Bullish Bets  Calls accounted for 51 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish and bearish bets were almost evenly divided as
157,554 contracts traded in the previous session.  November $110 calls were the most actively traded, with
13,000 lots changing hands. They rose 1 cent to $1. The next-
most active options, August $80 puts, declined 3 cents to 28
cents on volume of 8,536.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 44,346
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 39,915 lots and
December $70 puts with 35,712.  To contact the reporter on this story:
