South Korea  will review its policy of
providing free child care for children under two years old
because of the fiscal burden on local governments.  “The  Finance Ministry  will talk to local governments and
experts, and I promise we will come up with a solution to ease
the burden on municipalities while still benefiting everyone,”
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan told reporters today in  Seoul .
“The free child care system needs to be financially
sustainable.”  The system, introduced this year, expanded a previous
program offered to low-income mothers, and has helped drive down
consumer prices. Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said June
8 subsidies for child care and school lunches had helped bring
down inflation, which moderated to 2.2 percent last month from a
year earlier.  Separately, Bahk said the sluggish housing market and
 household debt  are short-term risks to economic growth.  North
Korea  and the country’s aging population are long-term threats,
he said.  “It is clear the kind of strong recovery we expected
earlier is being delayed,” Bahk said. “But I understand that
many think tanks hold the view that the second half will see
stronger growth than the first.”  South Korea’s gross domestic product may expand 3.3 percent
this year, less than a December estimate of 3.7 percent, the
Finance Ministry said last week. The cut to the growth forecast
followed the central bank paring its estimate to 3.5 percent
from 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
