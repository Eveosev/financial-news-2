Repsol SA (REP) , battling to avoid a cut in
its  credit rating , said about 64 percent of investors accepted
dividends in stock as Spain’s largest oil company hoards cash.  Repsol issued 35.3 million shares to offer equity payments,
raising its capital 2.9 percent, it said in a statement today.
The take-up of stock and a 5.6 percent cut in the final dividend
to 54.5 euro cents (67 U.S. cents) a share reduced the payments
in cash by about 460 million euros, Bloomberg calculations show.  “This is positive,” said  Peter Hutton , an analyst at RBC
Capital Markets in London. “It gives them much more room on the
dividend and frees up cash.” The acceptance of Repsol’s offer
by non-strategic shareholders was probably high, Hutton said.  Moody’s Investors Service, which like Standard & Poor’s and
Fitch Ratings rates Repsol at its lowest investment grade, cut
the outlook to negative from stable on June 29 on concerns the
European sovereign debt crisis will spread to corporate debt.  Repsol, down 49 percent this year in Madrid trading, fell
by 5 percent to 12.27 euros today.  “We’re happy that shareholders see the value in Repsol
shares,” Kristian Rix, a Madrid-based spokesman, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
