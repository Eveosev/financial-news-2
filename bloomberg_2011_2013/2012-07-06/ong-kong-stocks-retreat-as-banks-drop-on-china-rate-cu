Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  retreating from a two-month high, as banks plunged on
a declining earnings outlook after  China  cut  interest rates .
Losses were limited as developers gained on prospects for lower
rates to drive housing demand.  China Construction Bank Corporation (939)  led lenders down after
Barclays Plc. said lower interest rates could cut into profits
next year. China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. paced gains
among developers after the central bank widened discounts
available for mortgages.  PetroChina (857)  Co. Ltd. fell 0.5 percent on
a report the nation may cut fuel prices.  The  Hang Seng  Index fell less than 0.1 percent to 19,800.64
at the close, rising 1.9 percent on the week. Trading volume on
the gauge was 13 percent higher than the 30-day average. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies dropped
0.2 percent to 9,679.62.  “China is not insulated from the crisis,” said  Andrew Sullivan , principal trader at Piper Jaffray Asia Securities Ltd.
in Hong Kong. “The rate cut helps the economy but people can’t
find anything to do with the money they borrowed. It doesn’t
generate enough economic growth so there is no rush to chase
after the market.”  The benchmark Hang Seng fell 9 percent from this year’s
peak in February amid concern economic growth is slowing in
China and the U.S. as Europe’s debt crisis spreads. Companies on
the gauge trade at 10.3 times estimated earnings on average
through yesterday, compared with 13.1 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 10.7 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Financial stocks slid after the People’s Bank of China cut
the one-year lending rate the second time in a month. Net income
in the sector is expected to drop by 10 percent next year at
best, as interest margins narrow due to the rate cuts, according
to Barclays analyst May Yan.  Lenders Drop  China Construction Bank sank 2.7 percent to HK$5.15.
 Agricultural Bank of China  Ltd. retreated 2.5 percent to HK$3.11.
The European Central Bank yesterday joined its Chinese
counterpart in easing, cutting the currency union’s key rate to
a record low.  “Joint actions by global central banks once again have
failed to impress,” Hao Hong, head of Chinese research at Bank
of Communications Co. in Hong Kong, said in a report. “Monetary
loosening is likely to fail again -- until the measures are
strong enough to change the trajectory of decelerating economic
growth.”  Mainland developers rose after China’s central bank also
widened the discount banks can offer on mortgages to 30 percent
from 20 percent. Shanghai branches of Agricultural Bank of China,
China Construction Bank Corp. and Industrial & Commercial Bank
of China today began to offer the lower rates to first-time home
buyers, news portal Netease reported today.  Developers Climb  China Overseas Land (688)  rose 4.8 percent to HK$19.12. Sino-
Ocean Land Holdings Ltd. gained 5 percent to HK$4.38.  Hang Seng futures declined 0.3 percent to 19,821. The HSI
Volatility Index slid 1 percent to 18.41, indicating traders
expect a swing of about 5.3 percent in the benchmark index
during the next 30 days.  Oil producers fell on a report China gasoline and diesel
prices may drop by about 400  yuan  per ton on July 11, according
to China Securities Journal today, citing Xinhua oil price
system data.  PetroChina slid 0.5 percent to HK$9.88. Cnooc Ltd., China’s
biggest offshore energy explorer, retreated 1.3 percent to
HK$15.50.  Among advancing shares,  Foxconn International Holdings Ltd (2038) 
rose 3.7 percent to HK$2.78. The manufacturer is developing
smartphones with Amazon.com Inc. that run Google Inc.’s Android
mobile operating system to challenge Apple Inc.’s iPhone,
according to two people who asked not to be identified because
the plans have not been made public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
