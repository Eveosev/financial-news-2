Hong Kong  authorities seized a record
649 kilograms of cocaine worth HK$760 million ($98 million) from
a container that originated in  Ecuador , the government said
today. Three people were arrested.  The cocaine haul, the biggest seizure from a single bust in
Hong Kong, was found after the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration told local authorities suspicious shipments were
headed for the city, Hong Kong customs drug investigator  John
Lee  said at a briefing.  The drugs were believed to be en route to China and
southeast Asia, Lee said. Hong Kong customs agents have been
working with the DEA and South American authorities since the
start of the year to combat drug trafficking.  “We have to be a step ahead of the traffickers,” Lee
said. “It is uncommon that containers are used to ship drugs,
but the volume in each shipment is very large.”  “Hong Kong is not a drug transport hub,” Lee said.  Hong Kong police seized HK$600 million worth of cocaine in
an operation last September. On July 3, a 63-year-old man
arriving from Sao Paulo,  Brazil , was arrested after agents found
almost two kilograms of cocaine worth HK$2.2 million hidden in
his underwear and shoes, according to the customs  agency
website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
