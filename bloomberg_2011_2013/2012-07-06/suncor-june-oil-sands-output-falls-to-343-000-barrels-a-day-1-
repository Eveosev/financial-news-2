Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ’s June oil sands
production was 343,000 barrels a day in June, down 0.9 percent
from the previous month, according to a  statement  on the
company’s website.  Output averaged 346,000 barrels a day in May and has
averaged 307,000 barrels a day this year, Suncor said.
Production in March and April was cut because of scheduled and
unscheduled work, according to the statement.  Suncor will complete maintenance on a vacuum tower and shut
a coker at the No. 2 upgrader near Fort McMurray,  Alberta , in
the third quarter, according to a March 1  filing .  Sneh Seetal, a Calgary-based spokeswoman for the company,
declined in an e-mail July 3 to say if work at the upgrader had
started.  The Calgary-based company expects oil sands production
between 325,000 and 355,000 barrels a day this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
