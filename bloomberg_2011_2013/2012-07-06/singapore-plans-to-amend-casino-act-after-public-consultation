Singapore plans to amend the Casino
Control Act one month after it added 15,000 more citizens and
residents to a list of those banned from the city-state’s two
gaming resorts, according to a government  statement .  Some proposed amendments seek to restrict the number of
visits by residents who gamble frequently and land in financial
distress, Channel NewsAsia said in a report today. Families and
individuals can apply for a “visit limit” to the casinos under
the proposed amendment, it said. The government statement didn’t
elaborate on the proposed changes in the law.  The government, which awaits feedback from the public for
changes in the gambling regulation, plans to amend its six-year
old casino law to control criminal activities, strengthen social
safeguards and improve tax administration, according to the
statement on the Ministry of Home Affair’s website.  “With the benefit of practical experience in regulating
and managing the casinos over the past two years, a review of
the casino regulatory regime and the Casino Control Act is
therefore timely,” according to the statement.  The nation dropped its ban on casinos to boost tourism,
with  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  and  Genting Singapore Plc (GENS)  spending
more than $10 billion on two gaming resorts that opened two
years ago. They include  Southeast Asia ’s only Universal Studios
theme park and a downtown convention center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
