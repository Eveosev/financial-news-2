French soft wheat rated “good” or
“excellent” fell in the week ended July 2, crop office
FranceAgriMer said.  Seventy-one percent of the soft- wheat  crop received the top
ratings, compared with 72 percent a week earlier, the Montreuil-
sous-Bois, France-based office wrote on its website today. That
compares with 29 percent rated “good” or “excellent” in the
year-earlier period, when a spring drought stunted growth.  France  is the European Union’s largest wheat producer. The
ratings released today are the average for eight regions
representing 54 percent of the national soft-wheat area,
FranceAgriMer wrote.  Durum  wheat rated “good” or “excellent” rose to 59
percent from 54 percent a week earlier, based on three regions
that make up 58 percent of French production, the data show.
Durum is a hard variety of the grain used to make pasta.  Corn 
with top ratings improved to 74 percent from 73 percent.  Winter  barley  with “good” or “excellent” ratings rose
to 69 percent from 66 percent a week earlier.  Spring  barley
rated in the top two categories declined to 83 percent from 84
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
