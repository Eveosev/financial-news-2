MModal Inc. (MODL) , a maker of medical-
transcription software, was sued by a shareholder contending he
will be shortchanged in a planned $1.1 billion takeover by a
unit of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   Directors of the Franklin, Tennessee-based company “agreed
to the buyout at an inadequate price,”  Alan Kahn , the owner of
24,820 MModal shares, said in a complaint filed today in
Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington.  “The company has performed well for its investors in the
past and is expected to do so in the future,” Kahn said in the
complaint. He asked a judge to stop the deal and award damages.  MModal said July 3 that it had agreed to be acquired by
JPMorgan’s One Equity Partners for $14 a share, an 8.3 percent
premium at the time, and a tender offer would begin by July 17.  Dave Levy, an MModal spokesman at Shift Communications in
 Boston , said the company had no comment on the lawsuit.  MModal rose 5 cents to $14.05 today. The shares have
climbed 46 percent this year.  The case is Kahn v. Davenport, CA7675, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
