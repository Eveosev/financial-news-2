Portigon AG, formerly known as WestLB
AG, has transferred Louise Moat to  Hong Kong  as general manager
and co-head of the Asia-Pacific region, according to two people
familiar with the plan.  Moat will oversee the closing of WestLB’s operations in the
region and the establishment of a new service and portfolio
management unit for Portigon in Hong Kong, the people said,
asking not to be identified because the details are private.  Portigon’s Hong Kong unit will manage assets on behalf of
third parties, and manage the assets of the former WestLB
entities in Asia-Pacific, the people said.  WestLB, the 180-year-old German state-owned lender that
gained notoriety by trying and failing to make it as a global
investment bank, ceased operations on June 29. The bank closed
as part of European Union conditions tied to a 17 billion-euro
($21 billion) bailout following the 2008 financial crisis.  Dusseldorf-based WestLB changed its name and is becoming an
internationally operating service and portfolio management
provider to the bad bank, and to third parties. Its corporate
loan portfolio will be transferred to Landesbank Hessen-
Thueringen Girozentrale and all other units will be wound down.  Moat, who will be co-head with Terence Mark, was previously
a London-based member of the executive committee of structured
finance for WestLB, responsible for corporate acquisition
finance and the bank’s branches in  Russia , the  Middle East ,
Turkey and Asia-Pacific, one of the people said.  Her transfer was effective July 1, both of the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
