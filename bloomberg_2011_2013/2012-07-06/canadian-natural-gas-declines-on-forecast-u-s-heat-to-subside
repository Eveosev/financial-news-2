Canadian natural gas fell from a
five-month high to the lowest price in a week on forecasts for
moderating temperatures after a U.S. mid-Atlantic heat wave,
signaling less demand for fuel to run air conditioners.  August gas in  Alberta  declined 5.5 percent from the highest
level since Jan. 25 to the lowest since June 29 as MDA EarthSat
Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, predicted seasonal
temperatures across much of the central U.S. and Northeast for
July 11-15.  “It’s just a combination of slower weekend demand plus
people seeing the weather doesn’t look as it’s going to be as
hot for the next week,”  Martin King , an analyst with
FirstEnergy Capital Corp., in Calgary, said by telephone.  Alberta gas for August delivery decreased 12.5 cents to
C$2.155 per gigajoule ($2 per million British thermal units) as
of 3:25 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet market.
Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Alberta gas has fallen 16 percent this year, from C$2.58 on
Dec. 31, and risen 33 percent from C$1.625 at the end of March.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  declined 16.9 cents to settle at $2.776 per million
Btu.  Cooler Weather  The high in Chicago on July 11 may be 81 degrees Fahrenheit
(27 Celsius), 4 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College , Pennsylvania.  New York  may reach 82, 2 lower than
normal.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
4.35 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.965 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas rose 1.54 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.5547 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices advanced 1.6 cents to $2.7657.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet at 3:30 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.03 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was also 2.09 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 721 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.9 billion cubic feet today, or 72 percent of
normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.98
billion cubic feet at 2:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
