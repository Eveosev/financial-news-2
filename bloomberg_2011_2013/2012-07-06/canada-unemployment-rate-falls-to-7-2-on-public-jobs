Canada ’s  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly fell in June as employers  added jobs  for a fourth
consecutive month and increased wages at the fastest pace in
almost three years.  Employment rose by 7,300 in June, Statistics Canada said
today from Ottawa, and the  jobless rate  dropped to 7.2 percent
from 7.3 percent in May. Economists projected no change in the
unemployment rate and a 5,000 gain in employment, according to
the median in a Bloomberg News survey.  The data add to evidence the world’s 10th largest economy
may have picked up momentum in the second quarter, following a
slowdown that began at the end of last year, with Canada adding
155,500 jobs since February. Those gains may be short-lived if
the U.S. labor market doesn’t make more progress, said  Camilla Sutton  at  Bank of Nova Scotia. (BNS)  The U.S. Labor Department also
released payroll numbers today that showed employers hired fewer
workers than forecast in June.  “It’s going to be very difficult for Canada to hold up
these job gains with what is happening in the U.S.,” Sutton,
head of currency strategy at the Toronto-based lender, said in a
telephone interview. “The focus is on the U.S.”  U.S. payrolls rose 80,000 last month, Labor Department
figures released today show, less than the 100,000 gain
projected by economists.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said that while the report is
a positive sign for the Canadian economy, too many people remain
unemployed.  Fragile Economy  “From the  United States  to  Europe , the global economy
remains fragile and too many Canadians are still looking for
work,” Flaherty said in a statement sent by e-mail from his
office.  The Canadian dollar fell 0.5 percent to C$1.0197 per  U.S.
dollar  at 11:56 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys 98.07
U.S. cents. Bonds rose, with the yield on the benchmark 2-year
government note falling to 0.99 percent from 1.03 percent
yesterday.  Canada’s economy expanded at an annualized pace of 1.9
percent over the past two quarters, after averaging 3 percent
growth since the country emerged from its recession in 2009.  Swaps trading suggest investors are pricing in a 31 percent
chance that Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  will lower
borrowing costs by at least 25 basis points this year.  Government Jobs  Government-related employers led gains for a second month.
Education added 19,300 workers in June, while health care
payrolls climbed 19,900. Public sector employment has increased
45,800 over the past two months, while private employers have
cut 48,500 jobs.  Full-time jobs increased by 29,300 in June, Statistics
Canada said. Part-time employment fell by 22,000 positions.  Goods-producing industries fired 21,200 workers during the
month, with manufacturing recording its first decline since
November 2011. Factories have generated about half the country’s
job gains since February.  Construction, natural resources and agriculture also posted
declines in June.  Total payroll employment rose by 12,800 positions in June
while self-employment fell by 5,500,  Statistics Canada  said.  Average hourly wages of permanent employees rose 3.3
percent in June from a year earlier, faster than May’s 2.9
percent pace and the highest since August 2009.  Statistics Canada also reported that Canadian building
permits rose 7.4 percent to C$7.03 billion ($6.92 billion).
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a drop of 1
percent, according to the median of nine estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
