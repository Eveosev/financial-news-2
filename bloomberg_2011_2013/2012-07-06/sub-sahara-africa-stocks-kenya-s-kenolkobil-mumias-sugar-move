Jan. 6.  Nestle Foods Nigeria Plc (NESTLE)  , the West African
nation’s largest food company by market value, rallied the daily
limit of 5 percent to 498.04 naira, its highest price on record,
on speculation its expansion program will boost profit.  “The stock is gaining attraction from institutional
investors owing to its business expansion and expectations of
higher profit after it declared an impressive result in the
first quarter,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of
Lambeth Trust and Investment Co. said in a telephone interview
from Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
