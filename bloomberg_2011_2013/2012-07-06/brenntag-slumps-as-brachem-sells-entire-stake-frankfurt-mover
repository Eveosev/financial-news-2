Brenntag AG (BNR)  fell the most in more
than a month in  Frankfurt  after Brachem Acquisition S.C.A., the
German chemical distributor’s largest shareholder, sold its
entire stake.  Brenntag declined as much 3.2 percent to 88.86 euros, the
largest intraday drop since June 1, and  traded down  2.9 percent
at 89.14 euros as of 10:27 a.m. Brachem sold 6.9 million shares
of the chemicals company at 89 euros apiece.  “People aren´t necessarily interested in investing in
Brenntag anymore,” said Peter Spengler, a Frankfurt-based
analyst at DZ Bank AG, in a phone interview. Brachem’s “plan
from the beginning was to sell the shares in a series of
consecutive steps, the last of which they executed yesterday. It
seems that Brenntag is now starting from scratch again. How the
company performs without its biggest shareholder remains to be
seen.”  Brenntag raised 747.5 million euros ($926 million) in an
initial public offering in March 2010. It was the second-biggest
IPO in  Germany  since 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
