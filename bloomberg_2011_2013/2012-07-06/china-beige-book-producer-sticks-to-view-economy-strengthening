The U.S. company behind a survey that
showed  China’s economy  is improving stuck to its findings after
the nation’s second  interest-rate  cut in a month signaled
government concern over the slowdown.  “This and more easing steps should absolutely be expected
going forward,” Leland R. Miller, president of New York-based
CBB International LLC, producer of the  China  Beige Book, said
today in an e-mail. “Our conclusion was that the economy
continues to strengthen from a period of significant weakness;
by no means, however, is the economy in an overall strong
position.”  The China Beige Book, named and modeled after the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s anecdotal report, compiled data from about
2,000 interviews of executives and bankers in the world’s
second-largest economy from May 14 to June 8. The company said
earlier this week that official statistics may lag its data by
one to three months.  The report found  retail sales  and manufacturing
strengthened in the second quarter while property sales
increased and shortages of unskilled labor failed to abate,
according to a summary CBB provided to Bloomberg News before the
People’s Bank of China yesterday lowered benchmark lending and
deposit rates.  CBB said this week that its survey focuses on “tracking
evolving on-the-ground sentiment as it changes from quarter to
quarter.”  --Scott Lanman. With assistance from Kevin Hamlin in Beijing.
