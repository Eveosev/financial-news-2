OAO RusHydro,  Russia ’s largest
hydropower company, fell a second day on a Kommersant report it
may receive a smaller-than-expected payment for selling a stake
to state holding company OAO Rosneftegaz.  RusHydro declined 2.5 percent to 80.81 kopeks by the close
in Moscow. The shares have slumped 17 percent this year.  Russia’s presidential energy and fuel commission may
recommend RusHydro pay state-controlled power generator and
exporter OAO Inter RAO UES 31 billion rubles ($949 million) and
turn over Inter RAO’s shares after Rosneftegaz buys an 85
million ruble-stake in RusHydro,  Kommersant  reported today,
citing people familiar with the discussions. An earlier plan had
Rosneftegaz paying RusHydro the 85 million rubles, after which
the company would have issued additional shares to pay Inter
RAO, Kommersant reported on June 19.  “This deal does not appear favorable for RusHydro because
the company would receive only 54 billion rubles in cash instead
of the initially planned 85 billion rubles, which will not cover
the company’s capital expenditure needs,” Alfa Bank analysts
led by Alexander Kornilov said in an e-mailed research note.  Inter RAO dropped 0.4 percent to 2.77 kopeks.  -- Editors: Linda Shen, David Risser  To contact the reporter on this story:
