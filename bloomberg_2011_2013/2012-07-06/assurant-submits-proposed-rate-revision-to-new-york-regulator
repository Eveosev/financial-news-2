Assurant Inc. (AIZ)  said it proposed rate
revisions to New York Department of Financial Services
Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky after he said insurers may be
overcharging mortgage borrowers who lapse on premium payments.  “We continue to cooperate with the department’s review of
the industry, as we have from the outset, and we look forward to
further productive discussions,” said  Robert Byrd , a spokesman
for the New York-based company, in a statement today that didn’t
specify the new rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
