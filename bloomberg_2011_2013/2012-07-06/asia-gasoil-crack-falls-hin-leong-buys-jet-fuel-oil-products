Asia ’s gasoil crack spread fell,
signaling reduced profit for refiners. Hin Leong Trading Pte
bought two  jet-fuel  cargoes in  Singapore , the region’s largest
oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell $29.18 to $70.50 a metric ton at 6:06 p.m.
Singapore time, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The spread, a
measure of refining profitability for the fuel, is poised for a
weekly gain.  Gracewood International Ltd. sold a 50,000-barrel cargo of
95-RON gasoline to Royal Dutch Shell Plc. at $110 a barrel,
according to Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored
transactions on the Platts window. Shell sold a similar cargo to
BP Plc at $109.70 a barrel. PetroChina Co. sold Vitol Group a
same-grade cargo for $109.95 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s  premium  to Asian benchmark Dubai crude fell $2.79
to $16.75 a barrel at 2 p.m. Singapore time, PVM data showed.
The gap, also known as the crack spread, is poised to decline
for a second week.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising to
$1 a barrel. The  regrade  is poised to rise first time in three
weeks, meaning it’s more profitable to make  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  BP bought a 150,000-barrel gasoil cargo from SK Innovation
Co. at a premium of 20 cents a barrel over the benchmark prices,
according to the survey. The cargo is for July 27 to July 31
loading.  Hin Leong bought a 100,000-barrel cargo of jet fuel from BP
at a premium of 10 cents over the benchmark prices. The cargo is
for July 24 to July 28 loading. Hin Leong also purchased another
same quantity cargo from JP Morgan Ventures at same premium for
Aug 1 to Aug 5 loading.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 75 cents to
$1.91 a barrel, according to PVM. The difference widened for the
first time in three days and is headed for a second weekly fall,
indicating widening losses from processing crude into residual
products.  The premium of  180-centistoke fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
grade rose 25 cents to $10.75 a ton, PVM data showed. This
 viscosity spread  is rising for a second week, showing bunker, or
marine fuel, gained less than supplies used in power stations.  Tenders:  Bharat Petroleum Corp. offered to sell 30,000 tons of  fuel
oil  for loading from July 8, according to a tender document
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Qatar International Petroleum Marketing Co., known as
Tasweeq, offered to sell 40,000 tons of jet fuel loading Aug. 28
to Aug. 29, according to a notice sent to potential buyers.  PetroChina sold 60,000 tons of gasoil to Indian Oil Corp.,
said two traders who asked not to be identified because the
information is confidential. The Indian refiner paid a premium
of about $7.30 to $7.50 a barrel to Middle East prices for the
cargo, they said.  Refineries:  Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. will process 6.94 million
kiloliters of crude for domestic markets in the three months
ending September, a reduction of 7 percent from  year earlier,
according to a statement on its website. The company plans to
process a total of 17 percent less crude at its four refineries
in  Japan , including crude for global markets, the statement said.
Showa Shell plans to conduct scheduled maintenance at its
Yamaguchi refinery during the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
