Two Nigerians were accused by the
countryâ€™s attorney general of receiving $1 million from al-Qaeda
in Yemen, Punch reported, citing Justice Gladys Olotu, the
presiding judge in a case before the Federal High Court in
Abuja, the capital.  The two men, Olaniyi Babafemi Lawal and Luqman Babatund,
received the money to recruit Nigerians to the organization and
send them to Yemen, the Lagos-based newspaper said. They pleaded
not guilty, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
