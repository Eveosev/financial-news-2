barrels a day, according to the plan.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the field. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
