Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds held
at a record low after inflation slowed in June more than
forecast, supporting fixed-rate securities.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in 2024 remained at 6.93 percent, according to the central
bank, matching the lowest close since the securities were first
sold in 2009, a level reached yesterday.  Consumer prices rose 3.20 percent in June from a year
earlier after an increase of 3.44 percent in the previous month,
the national statistics agency said in a report late yesterday.
The median forecast of analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for a
3.32 percent annual inflation rate.  “Inflation confirms the economy is decelerating,” Julian Cardenas, head analyst at ING Pensiones y Cesantias, said in a
phone interview from Bogota. “The inflation number is positive
for bonds and also gives the central bank leeway if it needs to
cut  interest rates  to stimulate growth.”  Colombia’s policy makers on June 29 held the overnight
lending rate for a fourth straight month at 5.25 percent as
growth cooled and prices of the country’s commodities exports
dropped. Government reports in June showed industrial output and
retail sales unexpectedly fell in April and the economy expanded
4.7 percent in the first quarter, its slowest pace since 2010.  The peso declined for a second day, dropping 0.5 percent to
1,784.55 per dollar, paring its rally this year to 8.6 percent,
still the best performance among all currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The peso was little changed this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
