Foreign direct investment into South
Africa rose more than fourfold to $5.8 billion last year from
$1.2 billion in 2010, Business Report said, citing a report by
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s $2.4 billion purchase of a
controlling stake in  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  and a $1.3 billion
inflow from Jinchuan Group Ltd.’s takeover of copper producer
Metorex Ltd. were the biggest contributors to the growth in
investment, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  South Africa was the biggest recipient of foreign direct
investment in Africa after Nigeria, which attracted inflows of
$8.9 billion, the report said.  To contact the reporterresponsible for this story:
