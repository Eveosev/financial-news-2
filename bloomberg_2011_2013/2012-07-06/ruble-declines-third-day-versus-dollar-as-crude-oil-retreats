The ruble weakened for a third day as
oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, retreated and concern
deepened that Europe’s economy is struggling.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.9 percent to 32.83 per
dollar by the close in Moscow, extending this week’s losses to
1.2 percent. The ruble weakened against the euro for the first
time in six days, easing 0.3 percent to 40.42. The Russian
currency dropped 0.6 percent to 36.2455 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Crude oil fell 3.1 percent to $84.53 a barrel in  New York ,
while Spanish 10-year bond yields climbed above 7 percent.
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday
“heightened uncertainty” was weighing on confidence, pushing
the ECB to cut  interest rates  to a record low. U.S. payrolls
increased by 80,000 last month, trailing the median estimate for
a gain of 100,000 jobs. The jobless rate held at 8.2 percent,
the Labor Department report showed.  “Optimism is gradually waning” that Europe can shore up
its economy, Vladimir Tikhomirov, an analyst at Otkritie Capital
in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed research note today. The
currency may trade between 36.20 rubles and 36.60 rubles against
the basket next week, he said.  The  International Monetary Fund  will reduce its estimate
for global growth this year on weakness in investment, jobs and
manufacturing in Europe, the U.S., Brazil, India and China,
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said in Tokyo today.  Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.3645 per dollar
in three months, compared with investor expectations of 33.0452
per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
