Dynegy Inc. (DYNIQ) , a Houston-based power
producer, filed for  Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  in
Poughkeepsie,  New York , as part of a plan to reorganize.  Dynegy will merge with its Dynegy Holdings unit, which is
already in bankruptcy, under the plan, the Houston-based company
said in a statement today. The board met yesterday at a special
meeting to vote on the filing after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Cecelia Morris said at a July 2 hearing that she would approve
the unit’s so-called disclosure statement.  The unit’s plan will pay bondholders between 59 cents and
89 cents on the dollar, the power producer has said. Dynegy put
the unit into bankruptcy last year.  Under the proposal approved by Morris, the holdings unit
will merge with the parent company and creditors will own 99
percent of the combined entity. The plan is the result of a
settlement with creditors following a court-ordered
investigation into asset transfers.  Dynegy listed assets of more than $11 billion and
liabilities of over $5 billion in today’s bankruptcy filing.
Under the reorganization plan, the company’s assets will be held
under the parent company.  The company’s subsidiaries that own and operate its coal-
fired and gas-fired businesses weren’t included in the filing
today because they were financed last year, Dynegy said. The
company’s lawyers are the New York-based law firm White & Case
LLP. Its financial advisers are Lazard Freres & Co.  The case is In re Dynegy Inc., 12-36728,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Poughkeepsie).  To contact the reporter on this story:
