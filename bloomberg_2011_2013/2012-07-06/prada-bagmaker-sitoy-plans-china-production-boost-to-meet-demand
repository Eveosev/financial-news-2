Sitoy Group Holdings Ltd. (1023) , which
makes  Coach Inc. (COH)  and  Prada SpA (1913)  handbags, plans to boost
production capacity by 50 percent over two years as luxury
brands move more manufacturing to China to cut costs.  The company is building a new plant in Yingde,  Guangdong
province  and aims to boost capacity to 24 million handbags in
2014 from 16 million last year, Teras Yeung, chief executive
officer of the Hong Kong-based contract manufacturer said in an
interview.  Demand for high-end purses is climbing in China, defying
slower global economic growth and prompting bagmakers to
localize more production, cutting transportation costs and
delivery times, Yeung said June 25 in Hong Kong. The global
market for outsourced manufacturing of luxury bags and small
 leather goods  is likely to grow to $6.8 billion in 2015 from
$3.8 billion in 2010, Sitoy estimated in its initial public
offering  prospectus  last year, citing a Frost & Sullivan report.  “As Asia is the growth market for many European luxury
brands, it makes a lot of sense for them to outsource in China
where they can save costs on logistics and labor,” Yeung said.
Sitoy expects to add two or three customers a year, he said.  The manufacturer, whose prospectus also lists  Michael Kors
Holdings Ltd. (KORS) ,  Fossil Inc. (FOSL)  and  Tumi Holdings Inc. (TUMI)  as clients,
expects rising demand will hold up amid a dip in economic
growth. China yesterday cut benchmark  interest rates  for the
second time in a month to combat a slowdown in the world’s
second-biggest economy.  “Consumers may delay the purchase of a posh car, but they
won’t put off buying a nicely designed luxury handbag,” Yeung
said.  Shares Rally  Sitoy raised about HK$736.3 million ($95 million) in an
initial public offering last year, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Italian fashion house Prada owns 4.9 percent of the
company.  Sitoy gained 0.9 percent to HK$3.54 as of 11:04 a.m. in
Hong Kong trading. The shares have risen 20 percent from their
IPO price of HK$2.95. Prada, which also started trading in  Hong
Kong  last year, is up 30 percent from its offering price of
HK$39.50.  The global luxury handbag and small leather goods retail
market is expected to grow to $82.9 billion in 2015,
representing a compounded annual growth rate of 9.4 percent from
2010, Sitoy said in the  prospectus  citing Frost & Sullivan.  Coach, a client for 15 years, accounts for more than 50
percent of Sitoy’s revenue, making it the manufacturer’s biggest
customer, the company’s filings show. Coach said in an e-mailed
statement it doesn’t comment on strategy with individual service
providers. The company regularly reviews its sourcing strategy,
Coach said.  Sitoy posted a 15 percent  jump in net income  to HK$178
million and a 35 percent rise in sales to HK$1.62 billion for
the six months ended in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
