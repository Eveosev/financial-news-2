Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  temporarily
closed a European money-market fund to new investments after the
European Central Bank lowered deposit rates to zero yesterday.  The move affects the GS Euro Government Liquid Reserves
Fund and doesnâ€™t prevent redemptions, New York-based Goldman
Sachs wrote in an investor memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Its
contents were confirmed by Andrea Raphael, a company
spokeswoman, who declined to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
