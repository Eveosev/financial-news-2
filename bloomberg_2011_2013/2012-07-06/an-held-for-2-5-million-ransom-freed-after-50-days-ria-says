Moscow police freed a businessman
held for 50 by kidnappers in a country home outside the Russian
capital, RIA Novosti reported.  Assailants pushed the man into a car in central Moscow on
May 16 and held him hostage in the countryside while seeking a
$2.5 million ransom, said Victoria Tsyplenkova, a spokeswoman
for investigators, the state-run news service reported today.  One of the assailants was arrested in the operation, RIA
said, without providing any further details immediately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
