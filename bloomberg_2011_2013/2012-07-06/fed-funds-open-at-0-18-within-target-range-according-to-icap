Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.18 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.17 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.16 percent to 0.2 percent and averaging 0.18 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will sell $7 billion to $8 billion of
Treasuries maturing from January 2013 to June 2013. The sales
are part of the Fed’s program, which lasts through the end of
the year, to replace $267 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce
borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
