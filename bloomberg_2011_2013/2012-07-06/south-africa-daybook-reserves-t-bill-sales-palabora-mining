South Africa â€™s gross gold and
foreign-currency  reserves  probably increased to $49.1 billion
last month from $48.9 in the previous month, according to the
median estimate of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Pretoria-based central bank is due to publish the data
at 8 a.m. on its website.  (All events in Central African Time.)
