Californiaâ€™s Democrat-led Senate
voted to fund the first leg of a $68 billion high-speed
passenger rail line down the spine of the most populous U.S.
state, even as polls show waning public support.  The bill, passed by the Assembly yesterday, goes to
Governor  Jerry Brown , a Democrat and advocate of the bullet-
train to link San Francisco and  Los Angeles . The plan authorizes
the state to begin selling $2.6 billion of bonds already
approved by voters and anticipates $3.3 billion in U.S. matching
funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
