Stocks (SXXP)  and commodities sank, while
Treasuries rose for a second day, as slower-than-forecast growth
in U.S. payrolls fueled concern the economic recovery is
slowing. The dollar strengthened against 14 of 16 major peers,
with the euro setting a two-year low of $1.2266.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.9 percent to
1,354.67 at 4 p.m. in  New York , sending it lower for the week.
Treasury 10-year yields fell five basis points to 1.55 percent.
 Spain ’s 10-year yield climbed as much as 26 basis points to 7.04
percent, while the yield on German  two-year notes  fell below
zero. Three-month Euribor, or the rate European banks say they
see each other lending in euros, fell to an all-time low. Oil,
natural gas and wheat lost more than 3 percent to help lead
commodities lower.  Global equities extended losses this morning after U.S.
Labor Department data showed payrolls increased 80,000 last
month, less than a 100,000 gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
The European Central Bank yesterday reduced its benchmark rate
to a record low of 0.75 percent and the People’s Bank of  China 
cut borrowing costs for a second time in a month as policy
makers tried to revive the global economy.  “There is weakness around the world,”  Stephen Roach , a
professor at  Yale University  and former non-executive chairman
for Morgan Stanley in  Asia , said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. “When you are at extremely low levels of policy
interest rates, you can’t expect that that’s going to jump-start
the economy.”  Alcoa Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Caterpillar Inc., Bank of
America Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. lost at
least 2 percent to lead declines in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average. (INDU)   Technology Shares  Informatica Corp. (INFA)  slumped 28 percent, the most in 11 years,
after the software provider reported second-quarter earnings and
revenue that missed analysts’ estimates. Technology companies
fell 1.8 percent as a group, the most among 10 industries in the
 S&P 500 . Teradata Corp. and Citrix Systems Inc. sank more than
7.5 percent for the biggest declines in the S&P 500.  Today’s losses left the S&P 500 down 0.6 percent for  the
week . The labor report showed the  unemployment rate  held at 8.2
percent. Private employment, which excludes government jobs,
increased 84,000 in June, the weakest in 10 months. Today’s data
is the last monthly report before the  Federal Reserve ’s next
policy meeting. The  Federal Open Market Committee  is scheduled
to releases its statement on monetary policy and the economic
outlook on Aug. 1.  ‘Sustained Improvement’  “The Fed is looking for sustained improvement in the labor
market,” John Canally, an economist and investment strategist
at LPL Financial Corp. in  Boston , said in a telephone interview.
The firm oversees about $330 billion. “This report does push
the Fed closer to quantitative easing. If the current trend
continues, they are almost going to have to do something later
this year.”  The government’s previous employment report on June 1
showed 69,000 jobs were created in May, the weakest growth in a
year, and sent the S&P 500 down 2.5 percent for its biggest drop
of 2012. Ten-year Treasury yields reached a record low of 1.4387
percent that day. Since then, the S&P 500 had rallied 7 percent
through yesterday and 10-year rates have increased.  The rebound in equities came after a 9.9 percent tumble
from a four-year high in April dragged the S&P 500 to 12.9 times
reported earnings, the  cheapest level  since November. Alcoa Inc.
is scheduled to unofficially start the second-quarter earnings
season when it releases results on July 9.  Earnings Season  Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg project a 1.8
percent decline in profits for S&P 500 companies in the April-
June period, which would mark the first year-over-year decrease
since 2009, even as revenue increased 2.5 percent.  Earnings at  energy companies  fell 16 percent to lead the
decline among the 10 main groups in the S&P 500, the estimates
show, followed by a 12 percent decrease in profits at raw-
material producers. Crude oil tumbled 18 percent in the second
quarter to drag the S&P GSCI Index of commodities down 13
percent, the worst  declines  for both since the final three
months of 2008.  Five shares fell for each that advanced in the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, which slid 1 percent and trimmed its weekly gain to
1.3 percent. Spain’s largest banks, Santander SA and  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , fell at least 3.9 percent. Fifteen
of 19 groups in the Stoxx 600 retreated. Industrial production
decreased for the ninth month in May, the National Statistics
Institute in  Madrid  said.  A gauge of car companies tumbled 3.3 percent to lead
declines after PSA Peugeot Citroen reported that first-half
deliveries dropped 13 percent from a year earlier and its share
of the European market declined. The  region’s second-biggest
carmaker  tumbled 7.7 percent.  Euro Slumps  The euro extended its weekly loss against the dollar to
more than 3 percent, the worst drop since September. The shared
currency weakened against 14 of 16 major peer today and 15 of 16
over the last week.  The rate on German two-year notes was at minus 0.01
percent. The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for three-
month loans was 0.549 percent, compared with 0.641 percent
yesterday, European Banking Federation data showed.  The cost of insuring against default on European sovereign
debt rose for a third day, with the Markit iTraxx SovX Western
Europe Index of contracts on 15 governments climbing 8.1 basis
points to a midprice of 285.5.  Commodities Drop  Oil in New York dropped 3.2 percent to settle at $84.45 a
barrel. Corn ended a 12 percent rally over three days that was
due to dry weather crop damage in the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter of the grain. All but five of the 24 commodities
tracked by the S&P GSCI Index declined, with natural gas, cocoa,
oil, nickel and wheat losing more than 2.5 percent to lead
declines.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  lost 1 percent, trimming
its weekly advance to 0.9 percent. The Micex Index fell 1.5
percent in Moscow. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s largest
maker of televisions and mobile phones, dragged  South Korea ’s
Kospi Index down 0.9 percent after sales missed estimates. The
Shanghai Composite Index gained 1 percent as shares of
developers and industrial companies advanced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
