Top-seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia
won the second set to tie his Wimbledon semifinal with six-time
champion  Roger Federer .  The 25-year-old took the set 6-3 under the closed roof of
Centre Court. The 30-year-old from Switzerland took the first
set 6-3, and would take over the world No. 1 ranking with a
victory in the final. Heâ€™s never lost a semifinal at the All
England Club. Djokovic is trying to be the first man since
Federer in 2007 to defend the title at Wimbledon.  The winner will take on the winner of the match between
 Andy Murray  of Britain and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
