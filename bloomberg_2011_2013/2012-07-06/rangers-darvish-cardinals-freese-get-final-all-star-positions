Texas Rangers pitcher Yu Darvish and
St. Louis Cardinals third baseman David Freese got the final
positions on the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star rosters
after they won the most votes from fans.  Darvish, 25, who is pitching his first season in the U.S.
after coming from the Japan’s Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, got
more votes than Chicago’s Jake Peavy, Baltimore’s Jason Hammel,
 Kansas City ’s Jonathan Broxton and the Angels’ Ernesto Frieri in
the fan voting.  “I feel very good,” Darvish told reporters yesterday
through an interpreter. “I know the way that I got selected was
a vote by the fans, so I appreciate all the fans who voted for
me. I’m looking forward to it.”  Freese, 29, last year’s World Series Most Valuable Player,
bested Atlanta outfielder  Michael Bourn , Nationals rookie
outfielder Bryce Harper and  Arizona  second baseman Aaron Hill
for the final spot on the National League team.  “I’m thrilled,” Freese told reporters last night.
“Unbelievable support from friends, family and Cardinals
fans.”  The All-Star Game will be held July 10 at Kauffman Stadium
in Kansas City,  Missouri .  To contact the reporter on this story:
