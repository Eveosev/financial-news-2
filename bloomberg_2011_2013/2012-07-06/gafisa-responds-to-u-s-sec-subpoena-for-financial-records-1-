Gafisa SA (GFSA3) , the Brazilian homebuilder
that said it breached bond covenants in April, sent the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission documents after receiving a
subpoena from the regulator. The shares fell the most in more
than a week.  Gafisa filed its 2010 and 2011 annual reports with the
U.S., and posted the documents on its website, the company said
today in a Brazilian regulatory filing.  Regulators from the
SEC’s division of enforcement asked the Sao Paulo-based
homebuilder on June 14 to deliver all documents it used to
prepare its financial statements as far back as Jan. 1, 2010,
according to a U.S. regulatory filing earlier today.  “It is not clear what action, if any, the SEC intends to
take with respect to the information it gathers,” Gafisa said
in the filing. “The SEC subpoena does not specify any
charges.”  The  shares  fell 5.4 percent to 2.44 reais in  Sao Paulo 
trading, the biggest drop since June 27. The benchmark  Bovespa (IBOV) 
index declined 1.8 percent.  The homebuilder failed to satisfy some of the clauses of
its 2018 real-denominated floating-rate bond as its net worth
fell to 2.75 billion reais ($1.35 billion) in the fourth quarter
from 3.63 billion reais the previous year, according to an April
10 filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
