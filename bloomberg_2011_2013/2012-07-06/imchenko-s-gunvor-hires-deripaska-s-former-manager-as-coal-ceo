Gunvor Group Ltd., a trading company
partly owned by billionaire  Gennady Timchenko , hired Andrey
Churin as head of its coal business in Russia.  Churin, former coal managing director at Oleg Deripaska’s
En+Group, was made chief executive officer of the Kolmar coal
business from July 3, Gunvor said in an e-mailed statement
today. Gunvor and Timchenko’s Volga Resources are now closing a
deal to jointly buy 60 percent in Kolmar, Anton Kurevin, a
Moscow-based spokesman for Timchenko, said by e-mail.  The two companies last year funded the purchase of 51
percent of Kolmar from billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov  by
businessman Anatoly Mitroshin. Kolmar has licenses for
steelmaking coalfields in East Siberia’s Yakutia region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
