Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, plans to increase dealerships and showrooms in
 China  for the luxury Infiniti brand to as many as 150 by 2016
from 60 now, a company executive said.  “We won’t give up long-term investment plans in this
market merely because of short-term market fluctuations,”Allen Lu, managing director of Infiniti’s China unit, said at a
briefing in Beijing today. “The winter for luxury car market is
looming and consumers are going to benefit.”  Nissan Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  is counting on
China to help growth and meet a target of more than tripling
Infiniti sales in five years, taking its share of the global
luxury car market to 10 percent. The automaker set up Infiniti’s
headquarters in  Hong Kong  in May to boost China sales.  Nissan, which introduced the Infiniti nameplate to China in
2007, plans to increase brand sales in the country by 50 percent
this year, Ghosn said on May 22.  Last year, Infiniti’s deliveries in China climbed almost 40
percent to 19,000 units, making it the brand’s second-largest
market after the U.S. Nissan will begin manufacturing two
Infiniti models in China in 2014.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
