Ferrostaal GmbH purchased  Solar
Millennium AG (S2M) ’s 74.9 percent stake in Flagsol GmbH, giving it
full ownership of the solar-thermal venture.  Terms of the sale weren’t provided in a statement today
from the administrator that’s handling Solar Millennium’s
affairs after the solar-thermal project developer filed for
insolvency in December.  Flagsol, which was formed in 2007 to design and build
solar-thermal plants, developed four power projects in Spain and
one in Egypt. The technology, also known as concentrating solar,
uses mirrors to focus sunlight and heat liquids, generating
steam to power turbines.  Ferrostaal will retain all 80 employees of the Cologne-
based company, according to the statement.  Ferrostaal and Solar millennium have another joint venture
in the U.S., Solar Trust of America LLC, which filed for
bankruptcy in April.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  received approval from a  bankruptcy
court  June 27 to buy Solar Trust’s 1,000-megawatt Blythe solar
farm for as much as $50 million.  BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) 
submitted the winning bid in a June 21 bankruptcy auction to buy
its 500-megawatt Palen project. Neither of the California
developments has been built.  To contact the reporter on this story:
