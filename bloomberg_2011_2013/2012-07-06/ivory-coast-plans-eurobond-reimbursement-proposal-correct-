(Corrects spelling of  Finance Ministry  official in third
paragraph.)  Ivory Coast  is planning to make a
“reimbursement proposal” in September to holders of its
Eurobonds regarding further coupon payments, Minister of Finance
Charles Koffi Diby said.  An assessment of the country’s payment capacity “will be
performed by an IMF mission scheduled in September 2012 to
review Cote d’Ivoire’s economic and financial program,” Diby
said in a letter to holders of the bonds dated July 5, an e-
mailed copy of which was obtained from Standard Bank Plc.  Charles Boa, head of communications at the Finance
Ministry, declined to comment.  The world’s biggest cocoa producer said on June 15 it
resumed coupon payments on the $2.3 billion defaulted Eurobonds
due 2032 after missing three payments in 2010 and 2011 because
of political upheaval. It transferred $45 million on June 14 to
meet scheduled coupon payments due on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
