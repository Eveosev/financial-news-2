The Canadian dollar weakened against
its U.S. counterpart before reports that are forecast to show
the countries’ unemployment rates were little changed.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, depreciated
against the  U.S. dollar  before a government report that may show
that June’s payroll count probably capped the weakest quarter
for the country since 2010, economists predict.  Canada  is
projected to have gained 5,000 jobs in June, compared with an
increase of 7,700 in May, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  “Little bit of a risk-off tone this morning, but very
modest at this point given the potential turnaround from the
employment numbers,” Matthew Perrier, Toronto-based director of
foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal, said in a telephone
interview.  Canada’s currency dropped 0.1 percent to C$1.0152 per U.S.
dollar at 7:53 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys 98.50
U.S cents. The loonie was little changed against the euro at
C$1.2562 per euro, after reaching a two-year high against the
17-nation currency yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
