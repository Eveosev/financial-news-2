A commercial court heard yesterday
that Ghana in 2008 accepted  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s offer to buy 70
percent of Ghana Telecommunications Co. without negotiating the
deal, the Ghanaian Times reported.  Witness Issah Yahaya, a former director of the
Communications Ministry, told the court that senior government
officials approved the offer by the U.K.-based company within a
day, the Accra-based newspaper said.  A government-commissioned probe said in 2009 that some of
Ghana Telecommunications Co.’s assets had been “grossly
undervalued”. The court case was initiated by six plaintiffs
who argue that the government’s decision to transfer assets,
shares and equipment to Vodafone was against the public interest
and constituted an abuse of power, according to the newspaper.  Samuel Ablakwa, the country’s deputy information minister,
didn’t answer calls made to his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
