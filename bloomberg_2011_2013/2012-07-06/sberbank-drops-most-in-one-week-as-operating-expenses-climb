OAO Sberbank (SBER) ,  Russia ’s largest
lender, dropped the most in more than a week after operating
expenses climbed 22 percent in the first half.  Sberbank fell 1.8 percent, the biggest intraday decline
since June 28, to 89.26 rubles by 3:07 p.m. in Moscow.  Operating costs increased to 165.6 billion rubles ($5.1
billion) in the first six months of the year, from 136 billion
rubles a year earlier, as administrative expenses and salary
payments increased, the company said on its website today. Net
income under Russian accounting standards advanced 6.8 percent
to 183 billion rubles.  Accelerating operating expenses are “putting pressure on
the bottom line,” VTB Capital analysts led by Mikhail Shlemov
said in an e-mailed research note.  “While Sberbank remains undisputedly the best exposure in
the Russian banking universe, the stock is vulnerable to the
ruble weakening and the economy slowing in the second quarter,”
the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
