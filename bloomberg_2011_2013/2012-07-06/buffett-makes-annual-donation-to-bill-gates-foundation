Warren Buffett , the billionaire who
pledged to donate most of his wealth to charity, contributed
stock valued at $1.52 billion in his annual gift to the
foundation created by  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder  Bill Gates .  Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , donated about 18.4 million of his company’s Class
B shares to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to
a filing issued yesterday. The shares closed at $82.54 in New
York.  Buffett, a trustee of the foundation, is the third-richest
man in the world, with a net worth of about $46 billion,
according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index , a daily ranking
of the wealthiest people. He has campaigned to promote
charitable giving.  “I urge people to unbutton their wallet, pull out a check,
reach into their purse, whatever it takes,” Buffett, 81, said
last year in a YouTube video. “You will find that when you give
a dollar and something of yourself, a lot more than a dollar
comes out the other end.”  Buffett announced plans in 2006 to donate 10 million Class
B shares to the Gates Foundation and made an initial  gift of
500,000 shares. He said he’d release 5 percent of the remaining
balance of the stock each year. That means each donation
includes fewer shares than the year before.  The Berkshire executive said in a  2006 letter  that he
expected the value of the shares to rise “in an irregular
manner, by an amount that more than compensates for the decline
in the number of shares that will be distributed.” The B shares
were split 50-1 in 2010.  Gates Foundation  The Gates Foundation supports organizations throughout the
world aimed at improving education initiatives, enhancing health
care and reducing poverty. Gates, 56, is the world’s second-
richest man behind  Carlos Slim , the Bloomberg index shows. A
Berkshire director, Gates has joined Buffett in promoting the
Giving Pledge, a push to encourage wealthy people to donate most
of their fortunes to charity.  Following is a summary of Buffett’s stock donations to the
