A mansion owned by Diamondback
Capital Management LLC co-founder Richard Schimel was severely
damaged in a fire caused by a lightning strike during a July 4
storm, according to a fire department spokeswoman.  Lightning struck the roof of the hedge-fund manager’s home
at 12 Hallock Place in Armonk,  New York , just after 10:30 p.m.,
fire chief Luci Labriola-Cuffe said in a telephone interview
today. A housekeeper, who was the only person in the house when
the fire broke out, wasn’t injured, she said. Armonk is about 35
miles (56 kilometers) north of midtown  Manhattan .  “There’s significant damage to the house after the fire
burned down from the roof to the second floor,” Labriola-Cuffe
said.  About 75 firefighters spent more than four hours  battling 
the fire, she said. Three cars parked in the garage, including a
Ferrari, were spared, and a cat was rescued from a second-floor
bedroom. Schimel purchased the house in 2001 for $2.95 million,
according to Town of North Castle assessor’s office.  Steve Bruce , a spokesman for  Stamford , Connecticut-based
Diamondback, declined to comment on the fire, which was first
reported by The Journal News.  Schimel started Diamondback, which manages $2.3 billion,
with Lawrence Sapanski and Chad Loweth in 2005. The hedge fund
in January agreed to pay more than $9 million to end an insider-
trading investigation involving stocks including  Dell Inc. (DELL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
