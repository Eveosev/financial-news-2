Taiwan’s dollar was little changed
this week as accelerating inflation added to the case for policy
makers to favor a stronger currency, countering concerns over
slowing economic growth.  Government bonds  advanced.  The  consumer-price index  climbed 1.77 percent from a year
earlier last month, compared with 1.74 percent in May, official
data showed yesterday. Most  Asian stocks  retreated today after
interest-rate cuts in Europe and  China  failed to assure
investors the moves will be enough to boost economic growth.  “External factors are hurting the island’s exports, but at
the same time there’s the risk of accelerating inflation,” said
Ma Tieying, an economist at DBS Bank Ltd. in  Singapore . “These
two factors combined should have a neutral effect on the
currency.”  The  Taiwan dollar  traded at NT$29.922 against its U.S.
counterpart as of the close compared with NT$29.900 last week,
and slipped 0.1 percent today, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.740 yesterday, the strongest level since June 21.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady at 3.8 percent today.  Official data will show on July 9 exports rose 2.3 percent
in June from a year earlier after a 6.3 percent slump the
previous month, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.22 percent today
and during the five-day period, according to Gretai Securities
Market.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.507 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
 Taiwan  Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
