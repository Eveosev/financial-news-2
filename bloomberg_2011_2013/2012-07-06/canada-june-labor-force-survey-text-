Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  In June, employment was little changed for the second
consecutive month and the unemployment rate edged down 0.1
percentage points to 7.2%, as fewer people searched for work.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased 1.0%
or 181,000. At the same time, full-time work was up 222,000
(+1.6%), while part-time work was little changed. The total
number of hours worked rose 2.2%.  In June, there were employment gains in business, building
and other support services; health care and social assistance;
educational services; and utilities. These gains were offset by
declines in information, culture and recreation as well as
agriculture.  The number of public sector employees increased by 39,000
in June. Employment growth over the previous 12 months was
mostly among private sector employees, up 149,000 (+1.3%).  Employment rose in Ontario and was little changed in the
other provinces.  Women aged 25 and over posted employment increases in June,
while the number of workers in the other demographic groups was
unchanged.  Employment gains in service industries  The number of people working in business, building and
other support services rose by 24,000 in June. Compared with 12
months earlier, employment in this industry was little changed.  Health care and social assistance added 20,000 workers in
June. This industry’s employment level was virtually unchanged
from 12 months earlier.  Employment in educational services increased by 19,000 in
June, bringing total gains during the previous 12 months to
83,000 (+6.9%).  The number of people working in information, culture and
recreation declined for the second consecutive month, down
31,000 in June. This decline brings employment in the industry
back to levels similar to those recorded in the fall of 2011.  Employment also declined in agriculture in June, down
20,000, offsetting increases in April and May.  Although unchanged in June, employment in natural resources
posted the fastest growth rate among all industries over the
previous 12 months, up 10.9%.  June’s employment gains in Ontario  The number of people working in Ontario increased by 20,000
in June, and the unemployment rate stood at 7.7%. Compared with
12 months earlier, employment in this province was little
changed.  While there was little change in employment in Newfoundland
and Labrador in June, the unemployment rate increased to 13.0%
as more people entered the labour market in search of work. The
participation rate, that is, the percentage of people who are
employed or searching for work, has been trending upward for the
past two years, reaching 62.0% in June--the highest rate in this
province since comparable data became available.  Of all provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador had the fastest
year-over-year employment growth rate, at 4.0%, followed by
Alberta (+2.7%), British Columbia (+2.3%) and Saskatchewan
(+2.1%).  Despite little change in the number employed, the
unemployment rate in British Columbia declined 0.8 percentage
points to 6.6% in June, as fewer people searched for work.  Following three months of gains, employment was unchanged
in  Quebec  in June. The unemployment rate was 7.7%.  Employment up among women aged 25 and over  Employment rose among women aged 25 and over, up 18,000 in
June, bringing growth during the previous 12 months to 1.6%
(+114,000).  Among men aged 25 and over, employment was unchanged in
June. Over the previous 12 months, employment increased 1.4%
(+110,000) for this group.  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 was little changed in
June, and the unemployment rate rose 0.5 percentage points to
14.8%. Youth employment has remained at the same level since
July 2009, when the labour market downturn hit a low.  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects  labour
market  information about young people aged 15 to 24 who were
attending school full time in March and intend to return to
school full time in the fall. The May and June survey results
provide the first indicators of the summer job market, while the
July and August data will provide further insight. The published
data are not seasonally adjusted; therefore, comparisons can
only be made on a year-over-year basis.  The rate of employment among students aged 20 to 24, that
is, the number of employed as a percentage of their population,
was 63.2% in June 2012, down from 67.4% in June 2011. The June
2012 rate matches the rate observed in June 2009, when student
employment was hard hit by the labour market downturn, and is
also the lowest June employment rate since comparable data
became available in 1977.  The unemployment rate for these students was 13.0% in June,
up from 11.0% a year earlier, but lower than the 14.0% observed
in June 2009.  The employment rate for 17- to 19-year-old students was
51.4% in June, below the rate observed in both June 2011 and
June 2009. Compared with June 2011, the unemployment rate for
these students increased 3.5 percentage points to 17.3%.  Quarterly update for the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
information about the territories. This information is produced
monthly in the form of three-month moving averages. The
following data are not seasonally adjusted; therefore,
comparisons should only be made on a year-over-year basis.  In the second quarter of 2012, employment levels and
unemployment rates were little changed in all three territories
compared with the second quarter of 2011. The unemployment rate
in the second quarter of 2012 was 7.8% in Yukon, 8.5% in the
 Northwest Territories  and 15.7% in Nunavut.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will have
more variability. For an explanation of sampling variability of
estimates and how to use standard errors to assess this
variability, consult the “Data quality” section of the
publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by removing the
effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal
adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying economic
trends ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part -
partie3-eng.htm) .  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G,
free).  To contact the reporter on this story:
