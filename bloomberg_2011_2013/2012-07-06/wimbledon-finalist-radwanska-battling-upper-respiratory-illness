Agnieszka Radwanska said she was
suffering from a respiratory illness, one day ahead of her first
Wimbledon tennis final.  Radwanska, the third seed from  Poland , is scheduled to play
four-time champion  Serena Williams  for the women’s title today.
The illness forced Radwanksa to cancel a press conference
yesterday, after her media session from the semifinal match was
cut short because of a coughing fit.  “Unfortunately, I have picked up an upper respiratory
illness, which is affecting my nose and throat,” the 23-year-
old said in an e-mailed statement. “I have been playing a lot
of matches here in the rain and wind and haven’t been well for a
few days.”  Radwanska beat  Germany ’s Angelique Kerber 6-3, 6-4 two days
ago to become the first Polish woman to reach a Grand Slam final
in 73 years. She withdrew from the doubles competition because
of the illness.  “The priority is my singles match tomorrow, so I will do
whatever it takes to make sure I’m ready to play the best I
can,” Radwanska said yesterday. “Of course, it is always a
good sign to be playing singles and doubles in the second week
of a Grand Slam, but I wasn’t able to continue in both events.”  Radwanska has lost both times she’s played Williams, a 30-
year-old American whose 13 major singles titles are the most of
any active woman player.  “I think it’s going to be another challenge, especially
here on grass,” Radwanska said. “She’s playing amazing tennis
at the moment. I don’t really have much to lose, so I’m going to
try my best and we’ll see.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
