Overseas  investors  bought a net  4.56
billion rupees  ($82.9 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
raising their investment in the equities this year to 472.1
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 26.7 billion rupees of shares and sold
22.1 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. Foreign funds sold a net 1.87 billion
rupees of bonds, paring their inflow into debt this year to
217.4 billion rupees, the data  show .  Overseas investors have been net buyers of Indian stocks
since June 29, the day after the government said proposed laws
aimed at curbing  tax avoidance  won’t apply retrospectively or to
cases below a certain monetary threshold. The draft guidelines
released by the  finance ministry  on that day also proposed
exempting foreign institutional investors if they refrain from
routing money to India via tax shelters such as Mauritius.  Foreigners have invested 4.916 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.425 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Flows surged to a record
in 2010, making the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  the best performer
among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in
2008 led to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
