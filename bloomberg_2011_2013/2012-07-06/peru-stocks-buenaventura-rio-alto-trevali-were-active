The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Peru  trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
and share prices are as of the market close.  The  Lima General Index (IGBVL)  retreated 0.3 percent to 20,602.68.
The MSCI All Peru Capped Index fell 1 percent to 2,741.41.  Rio Alto Mining Ltd. (RIO)  , the Canadian gold producer
said, climbed 2.7 percent to $4.26, a three-week high. Rio Alto
said in a statement that gold grades at its La Arena mine have
been “significantly higher than planned.”  Other mining companies declined as gold and copper prices
dropped in  New York  after a smaller-than-forecast increase in
U.S. payrolls fueled concern that growth in the world’s largest
economy is slowing.  Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA  (BVN PE), the country’s
biggest precious-metals miner, fell the most in two months,
sliding 3.5 percent to $37.45.  Trevali Mining Corp. (TV)  , a
Canadian silver and zinc producer with operations in Peru,
tumbled the most in five weeks, dropping 4.2 percent to 92
cents. Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO PE), the nation’s biggest
copper producer, slid 1.2 percent to $31.70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
