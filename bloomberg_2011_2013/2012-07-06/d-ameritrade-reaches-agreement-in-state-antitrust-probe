TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD)  will
cooperate in a multistate investigation into potential
violations of antitrust law in the retail brokerage industry.  The company also agreed to implement an antitrust
compliance policy and training for employees, Connecticut
Attorney General George Jepsen said in a statement today.  The investigation focuses on possibly collusive conduct by
several retail securities brokers and firms that help them
execute orders, Jepsen said. Scottrade Inc. reached a similar
agreement in March.  Kim Hillyer, a spokeswoman for Omaha-based TD Ameritrade,
confirmed the agreement and said the investigation resulted in
no findings of wrongdoing by the company. TD Ameritrade reached
the accord with Connecticut, Missouri and Iowa, according to a
letter posted on the attorney generalâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
