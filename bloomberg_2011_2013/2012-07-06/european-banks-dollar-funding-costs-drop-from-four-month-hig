The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars declined from the highest in four months, according
to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 63 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:20 a.m. in
 London , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure
reached minus 69 basis points yesterday, the most expensive
since March 5.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 55 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
Euribor is the rate  banks  say they see each other lending in
euros and is derived from a survey by the European Banking
Federation.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- was 31 basis points from 30 yesterday. An increase
signals banks are less willing to lend. The Euribor/OIS spread
was 51 basis points from 50.5 yesterday. It’s the highest since
March 15.  The Eonia OIS swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs in euros over the next three months, was at 13
basis points from 14 yesterday. The measure dropped to a record
low 12.6 after the  European Central Bank  cut the deposit rate to
zero and the benchmark refi rate to 0.75 percent.  Overnight deposits  were little changed at the Frankfurt-
based ECB yesterday as lenders placed 791 billion euros ($979
billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
