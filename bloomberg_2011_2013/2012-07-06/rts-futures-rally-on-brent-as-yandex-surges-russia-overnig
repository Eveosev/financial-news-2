Russian  equity futures  rose as  Brent
crude , the basis for pricing the nation’s export blend, climbed
to a five-week high while  Yandex NV (YNDX)  gained after Bank of America
Corp. recommended buying the Internet search engine’s stock.  Futures expiring in September on the dollar-denominated RTS
index added 0.5 percent to 138,620 yesterday. The  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian companies in

Urals export blend, rose to the highest since May 31 after China
reduced  interest rates  for the second time in a month and as a

would halt production. Oil, together with natural gas, accounted
for about 50 percent of Russia’s budget revenue in 2011,
according to government data.  “Sentiment on Russian market has improved due to oil price
strength and a much more accommodative stance from global
monetary authorities,” Yan Gloukhovski, a trader at Alfa
 Capital Markets  in London, said by phone yesterday. “As
positive sentiment returns, we are starting to see the ‘Buy the
dip’ mentality coming back.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded

percent over the past four weeks, according to Liveinternet.ru.
Searches using Google, the world’s largest Web-search provider,
were at 26.4 percent, the data show.  “With Yandex’s leading position unlikely to be challenged
by Google in the near-term, the story remains solid with
expected strong growth in Russian search ad market,” Mariya Kahn, an analyst at Bank of America in  Singapore , wrote in the
report.  Rising Profit Margin  Yandex is expected to report a profit margin of 45 percent
for the second quarter, compared with 40.5 percent in the first
quarter and 42.1 percent in the last quarter of 2011, Kahn said.  Russia’s  consumer  confidence index rose 1 point to minus 4,
the highest since the third quarter of 2008, the Federal
Statistics Service in Moscow said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  Russia’s economy will probably expand as much as 4 percent
in 2012, more than the previous forecast of 3.4 percent, as
investment and retail sales outpace forecasts, Economy Minister
Andrei Belousov said on June 21.  “There are so many factors that support the Russian
Internet growth story, including an increase in  Internet users 
throughout the country, strong and further strengthening
 consumer spending ,” Alexei Gogolev, an analyst at JPMorgan

yesterday, trading at 5.3 times analysts’ earnings estimates for
member companies, a 48 percent discount compared with 10.2 for
Brazil’s Bovespa index. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at
9.7 times estimated earnings and the BSE India Sensitive Index
has a ratio of 13.7.  “Russian equities are cheap and valuations are supportive
of the market,” Gloukhovski said by phone from London
yesterday.  ‘Downside Risks’  Crude for August delivery fell 0.5 percent to $87.22 a
