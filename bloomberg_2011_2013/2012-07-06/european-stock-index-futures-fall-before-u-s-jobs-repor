European stocks extended declines for
a third day as payrolls in the world’s biggest economy increased
less than forecast in June.  PSA Peugeot Citroen retreated 7.7 percent after it said
sales dropped in the first half.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria
SA (BBVA)  slid 5.1 percent after HSBC Holdings Plc downgraded its
shares. Air France-KLM gained 4.4 percent after reporting higher
passenger traffic and an agreement with unions on cutting staff.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  lost 1 percent to 254.41 at the
close in  London . The equity benchmark still advanced 1.3 percent
this week, its fifth straight week of gains and its longest
winning streak since January. The gauge has climbed 8.8 percent
from this year’s low on June 4 amid speculation that central
banks would ease monetary policy.  “It seems that the markets are expecting another round of
quantitative easing in order to continue their upward
momentum,” said Theodore Krintas,  managing director of Attica
Wealth Management in  Athens . “The jobs figures will add to the
uncertainty over the coming week.”  Employers in the U.S. hired fewer workers than forecast in
June, showing the labor market is making scant progress toward
reducing joblessness.  Payrolls rose 80,000 last month after a 77,000 increase in
May, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
Economists projected a 100,000 gain, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The  unemployment rate  held at 8.2 percent. Private
employment, which excludes government agencies, increased 84,000
in June, the weakest in 10 months.  German Output  German industrial output  rebounded more than economists
forecast in May as construction buttressed  Europe ’s largest
economy against the sovereign debt crisis.  Production rose 1.6 percent from April, when it dropped 2.1
percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists
forecast an increase of 0.2 percent, the median of 36 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey shows. Production was unchanged from
a year earlier when adjusted for working days.  Spanish  industrial production  fell for the ninth month in
May as the recession in the euro area’s fourth-largest economy
worsened amid rising borrowing costs.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days fell 6.1 percent from a year earlier,
after an 8.3 percent decline in April, the National Statistics
Institute in  Madrid  said today. That was less than the median
forecast for an 8.1 percent contraction in a Bloomberg survey.  National benchmark indexes fell in 16 of the 18 western-
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX and  France ’s CAC 40 each
declined 1.9 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 0.5 percent.  Peugeot Sales  Peugeot (UG) , Europe’s second-largest carmaker, slid 7.7
percent, the most since November, to 7.08 euros. The company
said first-half sales declined to 1.62 million trucks from 1.86
million a year earlier as demand slumped in European markets.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the biggest maker of luxury
cars, fell 4.6 percent to 56.42 euros after Morgan Stanley
downgraded the stock to equalweight, the equivalent of hold,
from overweight. Daimler AG fell 3.3 percent to 35.34 euros
while  Fiat SpA (F)  dropped 5.3 percent to 4.05 euros. A gauge of
automakers posted the biggest drop of the 19 industry groups on
the Stoxx 600.  Delta Lloyd  Delta Lloyd NV (DL)  fell 4.4 percent to 11.09 euros after  Aviva
Plc (AV/)  sold 37 million shares in Dutch insurer, cutting its stake
below 20 percent. Aviva increased the number of shares sold from
an initial target of 25 million.  The share sale was part of a plan by Aviva, the U.K.’s
second-biggest insurer by market value, to exit almost a third
of its units to bolster capital reserves and limit the impact of
further turmoil in the euro region. Aviva said the shares sold
were priced at 10.75 euros apiece, giving gross cash proceeds of
318 million pounds ($494 million), and were several times
oversubscribed. Aviva rose 1.2 percent to 288 pence.  Brenntag AG (BNR)  slid 4.4 percent to 87.75 euros, after five
days of gains. Shareholder Brachem Acquisition S.C.A. sold its
entire stake of 6.9 million shares in the German chemicals
company.  BBVA tumbled 5.1 percent to 5.18 euros after HSBC
downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight, meaning
investors shouldn’t buy more of the shares.  Banco Popular
Espanol SA (POP)  slid 4.1 percent to 1.63 euros, dropping for a fifth
day. HSBC cut the stock to underweight from neutral, meaning
investors should reduce their holdings.  Italian lender  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  slipped 5.4 percent to 2.66
euros and Portugal’s Banco Espirito Santo SA lost 4.4 percent to
54 euro cents as European bank shares declined.  Software Decline  Software AG (SOW)  and  SAP AG (SAP)  slid 5.7 percent to 23.51 euros and
4.4 percent to 45.55 euros, respectively. Software companies
will probably lower full-year forecasts amid negative macro-
economic data, Berenberg Bank analysts Daud Khan and Jean Beaubois wrote in a note.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN) , a maker of banking
software, dropped 4.3 percent to 14.65 Swiss francs.  Carillion Plc (CLLN) , builder of the 255 million-pound ($400
million) London Olympics media center, fell 6.2 percent, the
most since April 2009, to 251.4 pence as UBS AG and Liberum
Capital Ltd. cut their recommendations on the stock to sell,
citing concerns about margins.  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  declined 3.3 percent to 9.28
francs. Chief Financial Officer Dirk Kirsten will resign by Jan.
31 to pursue opportunities outside the company.  Air France-KLM (AF)  gained 4.4 percent to 4.06 euros after it
reported a 4.6 percent increase in June passenger traffic and
unions said an agreement had been reached on cutting ground-
staff positions.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  advanced 0.8 percent to
9.27 euros.  Arkema SA (AKE) , a French maker of industrial chemicals, surged
11 percent to 59.28 euros. The company may have received
“multiple takeover approaches” valuing the business at 5.5
billion euros ($6.8 billion) or more, FT Alphaville reported.  Arkema has drawn interest from DuPont Co. and BASF SE, FT
Alphaville said, citing “usually knowledgeable sources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
