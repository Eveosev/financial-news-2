Mongolia’s newly elected members of
parliament began their first session today even as four of the
76 seats in the State Great Khural remain undecided.  The General Election Commission submitted the names of 72
winning candidates from last week’s nationwide vote for the
president’s approval, according to a statement on President
Tsakhia Elbegdorj’s website. A new vote is needed in two seats
after candidates failed to gather the 28 percentage threshold
stipulated by the election law, the commission said last week.  The results of two more seats contested in Uvurkhangai
province are being investigated after the commission received
documents alleging breeches of the election law by the winning
candidates, News.mn  reported  yesterday. The candidates, from the
Mongolian People’s Party, distributed alcohol and sweets to
voters, the  news agency  said, citing the commission.  From the 72 names approved by the election commission, the
Democratic Party leads with 31 and the MPP has 25. The Justice
coalition, which includes the party of ex-president Nambaryn Enkhbayar, has 11 seats, and the Civil Will party has two seats.
Three other seats went to independents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
