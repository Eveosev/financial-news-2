Russian stocks fell for a second day
as oil dropped and as interest-rate cuts in Europe and  China 
failed to assure investors the moves will be enough to boost
economic growth.  The 30-stock Micex Index declined 0.2 percent to 1,433.09
at the start of trading in Moscow. Aluminum maker United Co.
Rusal slipped 1.1 percent to 183.55 rubles and coal producer OAO
Raspadskaya dropped 0.8 percent to 82.01 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
