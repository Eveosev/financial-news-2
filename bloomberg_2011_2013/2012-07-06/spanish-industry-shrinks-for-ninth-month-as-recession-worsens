Spanish  industrial production  fell
for the ninth month in May as the recession in the euro area’s
fourth-largest economy worsened amid rising borrowing costs.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days fell 6.1 percent from a year earlier,
after an 8.3 percent decline in April, the National Statistics
Institute in Madrid said today in an e-mailed statement. That is
less than the median forecast for an 8.1 percent contraction in
a Bloomberg survey of seven economists.  Spain ’s recession probably intensified in the second
quarter as the European sovereign debt crisis worsened, the Bank
of Spain said on June 27. Acerinox SA, Spain’s largest
steelmaker, is laying off workers for as many as 15 days per
month at the Ponferrada plant of its Roldan SA unit.  Amper SA, which makes telecommunications equipment, said on
June 29 it would lay off 220 employees.  As the government’s access to financial markets narrows,
Spain is negotiating the terms of a 100 billion-euro ($125
billion) European bailout for its banks. The yield on Spain’s
10-year benchmark bond was little higher at 6.86 percent at 8:52
a.m. in Madrid, compared with a euro-era intraday high of 7.285
percent on June 18.  The government predicts domestic demand, including spending
by public administrations, will shrink 3.1 percent in 2012, more
than four times last year’s rate, as close to a quarter of the
workforce is jobless. Exports, which the government forecast
would drive the recovery, dropped in April for the first time
since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
