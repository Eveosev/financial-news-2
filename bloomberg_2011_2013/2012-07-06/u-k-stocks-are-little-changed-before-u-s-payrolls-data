U.K. stocks  dropped from a two-month
high as a report showed that the  U.S. economy  added fewer jobs
last month than economists had estimated.  Rio Tinto  Group declined 2.8 percent as commodity producers
retreated.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  rose 1.2 percent after selling more shares
in  Delta Lloyd  NV than previously planned.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  lost 30 points, or 0.5 percent, to
5,662.63 at the close in London. The gauge has still added 1.7
percent this week, its biggest weekly gain since the beginning
of June as the  Bank of England  increased its bond-buying program
and surveys of manufacturing in economies from China to the euro
area beat economists’ estimates. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index also dropped 0.5 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
slipped 1.6 percent.  “The U.S. numbers are disappointing, not just at the
headline level, but also at the private employment level,” said
Gerard Lane, a strategist at Shore Capital Group Ltd. in
Liverpool, England. “The news is not bad enough to lead to
quantitative easing, and it’s not good news.”  A U.S. Labor Department report today showed that employers
in the world’s largest economy hired fewer workers in June than
economists had forecast. Payrolls rose 80,000 last month after
increasing a revised 77,000 in May, the release showed.
Economists had projected a 100,000 gain, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The  unemployment rate 
remained at 8.2 percent.  German industrial output  increased 1.6 percent in May,
according to a report from the country’s Economy Ministry in
Berlin. Economists had forecast production would climb 0.2
percent. The measure dropped 2.1 percent in April.  Spanish Production  In Spain, a report from the National Statistics Institute
in  Madrid  showed that  industrial production  dropped for a ninth
month in May, slumping 6.1 percent from a year earlier. The
 average estimate of seven economists  surveyed by Bloomberg had
called for an 8.1 percent contraction.  A  gauge  of mining shares listed on the FTSE 350 Index
dropped 2.2 percent today. Rio Tinto, the world’s third-biggest
commodity producer, lost 2.8 percent to 3,069 pence and
 Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  slipped 3.9 percent to 458.8 pence.  Marks & Spencer Plc declined 3.4 percent to 318 pence after
the Financial Times said the clothing retailer will report its
worst quarterly trading in three years.  Aviva rose 1.2 percent to 288 pence after the  U.K.’s
second-biggest insurer by market value  sold 37 million shares in
Delta Lloyd. The company originally planned to sell 25 million.
It increased the size of the sale because of greater-than-
expected demanded from investors.  Centrica Plc (CNA)  gained 1.2 percent to 319.1 pence after
winning approval for a 580-megawatt wind farm off the coast of
Lincolnshire and north Norfolk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
