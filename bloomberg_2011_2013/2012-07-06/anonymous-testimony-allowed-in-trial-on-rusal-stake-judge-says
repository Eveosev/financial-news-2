Some witnesses in a trial beginning
July 9 between United Co. Rusal Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska  and Israeli businessman  Michael Cherney  could give
evidence anonymously, a London judge said today.  Judge Andrew Smith refused the anonymity petitions for nine
of the 12 witnesses, granting one witness’s request and giving
two others a limited shield, without saying why. Some hearings
had been held in private to protect their identities.  Cherney sued Deripaska in 2006 for a stake in Rusal, saying
they were partners in the 1990s and he is owed about 13 percent
of the company from a 2001 agreement he made with Deripaska in
London. The stake would be worth about $1 billion now. Deripaska
denies Cherney ever had a stake.  Deripaska wants to appeal today’s decision to the Court of
Appeal and the identities of all 12 must be kept secret until
that application is heard, Smith said.  The case is Cherney v. Deripaska,  High Court  of Justice,
Queen’s Bench Division, Commercial Court 06-1218.  To contact the reporter on this story:
