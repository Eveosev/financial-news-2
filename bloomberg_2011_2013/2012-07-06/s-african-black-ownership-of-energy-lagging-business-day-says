Black ownership of  South Africa ’s
energy industry reached 18.9 percent in 2010, falling short of
the 25 percent level targeted under codes finalized in 2000,
Business Day reported, citing an audit by independent company
Moloto Solutions.  Energy Minister Dipuo Peters will meet heads of companies
operating in the industry to set deadlines to meet the
requirements of a sector charter, part of the country’s
Petroleum Products Act, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited
Peters as saying.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
