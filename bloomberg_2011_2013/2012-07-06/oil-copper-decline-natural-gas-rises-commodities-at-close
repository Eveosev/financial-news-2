The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 1 percent to 613.86 at 5:12 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials slipped
0.7 percent to 1515.312.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell a second day in  New York , trimming a weekly gain,
after interest-rate cuts in Europe and  China  failed to assure
investors the moves will be enough to boost economic growth and
support demand.  Oil for August delivery fell as much as $1.35 to $85.87 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $86.14 at 8:54 a.m. London time. Prices have risen
1.4 percent this week and are heading for a second weekly gain,
the first back-to-back increase since April. Crude is down 13
percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures climbed above $3 per million British
thermal units in New York for the first time in almost six
months on speculation data today will show a smaller-than normal
increase in stockpiles.  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha swaps for August rose $17.50, or 2.2 percent, to
$817.50 a ton, according to PVM. That’s the highest since May 31.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
advanced $22.70 to $64.02 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of processing profit,
was the widest since May 23.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday declined $1.02 to
$16.21 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. A narrower
reforming margin means it is less profitable to make motor fuel.  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude gained 7
cents to $17.30 a barrel, according to PVM.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold is set decline for a third day in  London  as a
strengthening dollar curbs demand for the metal as an
alternative investment.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$1,599.68 an ounce by 9:34 a.m. in London. Prices are up 0.1
percent this week. August-delivery futures were 0.6 percent
lower at $1,599.70 on the Comex in New York.  Silver for immediate delivery declined 0.3 percent to
$27.5775 an ounce. Palladium was down 0.5 percent at $583.34 an
ounce. Platinum was down 0.4 percent at $1,467.75 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper was seen slumping for a third day in London before a
report that may round out the weakest quarter for employment in
more than two years in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest
consumer of the metal.  Copper for three-month delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
$7,676 a metric ton by 9:27 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices are little changed this week. September-delivery copper
fell 0.2 percent to $3.485 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
