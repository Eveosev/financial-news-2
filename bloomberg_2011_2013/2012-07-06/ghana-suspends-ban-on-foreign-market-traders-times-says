Ghana temporarily suspended a
decision to close foreign-owned shops in markets after protests
from the regional body Ecowas, the Ghanaian times reported,
citing Trade Minister Hanna Tetteh.  Non-Ghanaian retailers, including citizens of the Economic
Community of West African States, will still be expected to
invest a minimum of $300,000 in their business, the Accra-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
