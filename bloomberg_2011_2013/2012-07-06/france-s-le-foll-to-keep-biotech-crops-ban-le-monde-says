French Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll wants to keep the country’s moratorium on existing
genetically-modified crops, Le Monde  said , citing an interview.  Existing genetically-modified crops are “not
satisfactory,” and bio-resistance to modified corn in the U.S.
is “a real subject of concern,” Le Foll said, according to the
daily.  Le Foll said it’s necessary to remain open-minded about
research into modified crops, Le Monde wrote. The minister said
genetic improvements to improve crop quality or reduce water
stress for plants and using biotechnology in traditional plant
breeding could be “interesting,” Le Monde wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
