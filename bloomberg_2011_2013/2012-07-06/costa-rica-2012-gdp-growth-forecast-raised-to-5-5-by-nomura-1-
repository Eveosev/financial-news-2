Costa Rica ’s economy will expand
faster than forecast this year, outpacing inflation for the
first time in “recent memory,” Nomura Securities International
said in a report.  Gross domestic product in Central America’s second-biggest
economy will climb 5.5 percent this year, up from an earlier
forecast of 4 percent,  Boris Segura , a Latin America analyst for
Nomura, wrote today. Inflation should remain within the central
bank’s target of 5 percent, plus or minus one percentage point,
the first time consumer prices are likely to trail below
economic growth since 1992, the report said.  “For the first time in recent memory, Costa Rica is poised
to show real GDP growth that exceeds its inflation rate,”
Segura wrote. “This speaks volumes about Costa Rica’s
macroeconomic stability.”  While economic growth should improve tax revenues, Costa
Rica still needs to pass “full-fledged fiscal reform” to lower
its deficit, according to Nomura.  Consumer prices rose 4.6 percent in June from a year
earlier, the national statistics institute reported July 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
