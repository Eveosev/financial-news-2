U.S. stocks fell for the week, after
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index reached a two-month high, as
jobs data heightened concern about a slowing economy and
Europe’s efforts to tame its debt crisis disappointed investors.  Industrial and financial stocks lost the most in the  S&P
500  in the holiday-shortened week, sinking more than 1.2
percent, as eight out of 10  industries  in the benchmark index
retreated.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and
 General Electric Co. (GE)  led declines in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  surged 20 percent after an analyst said
the company’s online audience exceeds cable and TV networks.  The S&P 500 lost 0.6 percent to 1,354.68 for the week,
trimming its gain for the year to 7.7 percent. The Dow dropped
107.62 points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,772.47. Global stocks
surged the previous week, with the S&P 500 rallying 2 percent,
amid optimism that an agreement by European leaders would help
contain the region’s debt crisis.  “The jobs report is the single most important economic
statistic and unfortunately it’s not showing signs of health,
which is weighing down on stocks,” said  Lawrence Creatura , who
helps oversee $363.6 billion as a Rochester, New York-based fund
manager at Federated Investors Inc. “Europe has become a multi-
year yo-yo of increasing expectations and subsequent
disappointment.”  The S&P 500 erased a 0.4 percent advance for the week in
the  final session  after American employers hired fewer workers
than forecast in June, showing the labor market is making scant
progress toward reducing joblessness. The unemployment rate held
at 8.2 percent.  Cutting Rates  Investors entered the July 4 holiday with the S&P 500 at a
two-month high as speculation grew that policy makers would act
to spur economic growth. That advance came to a halt on July 5
after the European Central Bank reduced its benchmark rate to a
record low, while President  Mario Draghi  said the cut may have
only a limited effect on the euro-area economy. China also
lowered rates in a bid to expand investments and consumption.  “Although the stimulus junkies liked the news from the ECB
and China, the public comments of Mario Draghi clearly carried
the most weight,”  Mike Shea , a managing partner at New York-
based brokerage firm Direct Access Partners LLC, said in an
interview. “We start out the U.S. earnings season on a
decidedly lousy note with the jobs report missing already low
expectations, and anybody who was thinking we have set the bar
low enough on earnings may run back and reassess their
numbers.”  Earnings Season  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  is the first Dow company scheduled to report
quarterly results on July 9, and analysts forecast the largest
U.S. aluminum maker will post an 82 percent drop in per-share
profit. Analysts project a 1.8 percent decline in profits for
 S&P 500 (SPX)  companies in the April-June period, which would mark the
first year-over-year decrease since 2009.  Concern about a global economic slowdown put the S&P 500
last month on the brink of a so-called correction, or a 10
percent decline from a recent peak. The index slumped 3.3
percent in the second quarter, the biggest retreat since the
period ending in September.  The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)  of companies most-tied to
economic growth slumped 0.5 percent for the week. DuPont Co.,
the most valuable U.S. chemical company, sank 3.3 percent to
$48.90, while GE retreated 4 percent to $20. Industrial
companies in the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent for the biggest drop
among 10 industries.  Banks Tumble  Financial stocks  fell the second-most, losing 1.2 percent
as a group. JPMorgan slumped 5.1 percent, the second-biggest
decline in the Dow, to $33.90. The lender was ordered by a
federal judge to explain why it shouldn’t be compelled to turn
over e-mails sought by U.S. regulators in a probe of potential
energy-market manipulation. Bank of America slid 6.4 percent to
$7.66 for the biggest retreat in the 116-year-old stock gauge.  A group of six  health insurers  in the S&P 500 fell 4.2
percent as a group, with  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  sinking 6.1 percent to
$59.91. The second-largest U.S. health-plan provider has erased
about 14 percent in the six days since the Supreme Court’s
decision to uphold President  Barack Obama ’s health-care reform.
Minnetonka, Minnesota-based  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the biggest
health insurer, declined 4.6 percent to $55.82 for the week.  Consumer staples companies had the biggest gain as a group,
climbing 0.5 percent. Limited Brands Inc. and  Ross Stores Inc. (ROST) 
led a rally in retailers after reporting June sales that topped
estimates. Limited Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s
Secret, jumped 7.7 percent to $45.82 and discounter Ross added
7.4 percent to $67.12.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s largest
retailer, rose 2.4 percent to $71.36 for the biggest gain in the
Dow.  Netflix, GM  Netflix advanced the most in the S&P 500, rising 20 percent
to $81.89. The largest video-subscription service’s estimated 24
million domestic subscribers probably watched an average of 40
hours of programming online last month, analyst  Rich Greenfield 
of BTIG Research wrote in a July 3 report. He based his estimate
on a posting by Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings.  General Motors Co. (GM)  jumped 3 percent to $20.31. The
automaker said sales climbed 16 percent in June, beating the 7.6
percent increase that was the average estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
