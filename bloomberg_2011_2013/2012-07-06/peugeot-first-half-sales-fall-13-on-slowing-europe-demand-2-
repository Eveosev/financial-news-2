PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , Europe’s second-
biggest carmaker, said first-half deliveries fell 13 percent as
demand slumped in European markets.  Sales declined to 1.62 million vehicles from 1.86 million a
year earlier, the Paris-based company said today in a statement.
Peugeot said it suffered from Europe’s “very weak” economic
environment, where demand for cars and light commercial vehicles
declined 7.2 percent.  “The first half was very, very bad, and I see no reason
why the second half would be any better,” said Erich Hauser, a
London-based  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  analyst who has an underperform
recommendation on the shares. “The situation in Europe will
only get worse as we go forward.”  Peugeot and the French government today denied comments
from Philippe Bonnin, the mayor of Chartre de Bretagne, where
Peugeot employs 5,800 people, that the automaker is seeking a
loan from the French state. Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin plans to shed as many as 10,000 French jobs, more than the
previously announced 6,000 positions, Christian Lafaye, the head
of Peugeot’s second-biggest union FO, said this week.  Peugeot  plummeted  as much as 7.7 percent to 7.08 euros, the
biggest intraday fall since March 1, and was down 6.8 percent at
7.15 euros as of 3:17 p.m. in Paris trading. The stock has
plunged 74 percent in a year, valuing the carmaker at 2.53
billion euros.  Cutting Costs  Varin told unions last week the carmaker will need to raise
its 2012 savings target of 1 billion euros ($1.24 billion),
according to Franck Don, a CFTC union representative.  The carmaker’s European market share narrowed to 13 percent
from 14 percent a year earlier, the manufacturer said today.
Peugeot’s deliveries to other regions rose to 39 percent of the
company’s total in the first half from 38 percent a year
earlier.  Chinese sales grew 7.2 percent to 209,000 vehicles, helped
by “strong” demand for the Peugeot 308 and Citroen C4 family
cars. In  Latin America , Peugeot posted a 21 percent drop as a
higher Brazilian  sales tax  and slowing economy hurt sales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
