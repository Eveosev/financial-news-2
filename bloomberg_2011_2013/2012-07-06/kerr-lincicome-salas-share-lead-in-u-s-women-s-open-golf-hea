Suzann Pettersen holds a one-stroke
lead over Michelle Wie and Cristie Kerr going into today’s third
round of the U.S. Women’s Open golf championship.  Pettersen was 5 under par after a 4-under round of 68
yesterday at the Blackwolf Run Championship Course in Kohler,
 Wisconsin . Wie had 7 birdies and a bogey for a 66, while Kerr,
the 2007 champion, shot 1 under after an opening-round 69.  “I like the U.S. Opens. It’s usually the biggest test of
golf throughout the year” Pettersen told reporters. “I like
the way the USGA set up the courses. They make it tough. They
make it fair. And it’s by far one of my favorite championships,
just because of that.”  Players, who coped with temperatures as high as 92 degrees
Fahrenheit (33 Celsius) with 70 percent humidity during the
tournament’s first two days, were anticipating highs in the 70s
today and tomorrow.  Wie, 22, has missed the cut in six of eight events on the
LPGA Tour this season. She graduated from  Stanford University  in
last month.  “I’m pretty stoked to be back in contention and honestly
not have to worry about the cut line,” Wie told reporters. “It
feels pretty good. I’m looking forward to a good weekend.”  Cheyenne Woods, the niece of  Tiger Woods , missed the cut
after ending the second round at 9-over 153. She bogeyed four of
her opening six holes yesterday after an opening-round 75 that
included five bogeys.  Defending champion So Yeon Ryu, who beat South Korean
countrywoman Hee Kyung Seo in a playoff last year, is 1 over,
one shot ahead of No. 1-ranked Yani Tseng of  Taiwan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
