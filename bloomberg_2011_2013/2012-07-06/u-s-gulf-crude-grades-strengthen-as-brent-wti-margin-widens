U.S. Gulf Coast crudes strengthened
versus West Texas Intermediate as the benchmark’s discount to
 Brent crude  widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent increased 29 cents to $13.77
a barrel at 2:01 p.m. in  New York . When Brent rises versus WTI,
it typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 25 cents to
$13.25 a barrel at 2:11 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained 15 cents to
$13 a barrel over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium increased 20 cents to $8.25 a barrel,
while Southern Green Canyon rose 10 cents to $7.60 over. Mars
Blend added 20 cents to $9.30 a barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, decreased 5 cents to
an $11.25-a-barrel premium.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed 75 cents
to $25.75 a barrel. Syncrude’s discount widened 25 cents to $3.
Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in
 Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Bakken oil was unchanged at $10 below the U.S. benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
