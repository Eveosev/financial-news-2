Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the
world’s largest custody bank, agreed to pay $280 million to
settle a lawsuit blaming the company for losses in connection
with Sigma Finance Inc.  BNY Mellon said today that it took an after-tax charge of
$210 million in the second quarter to include part of the
anticipated cost of the settlement. The accord is subject to
court approval, the New York-based bank said in a statement.  “The Sigma settlement agreement reflects the meaningful
progress we are making in navigating the litigation environment
that affects our company and the industry overall,” Gerald L. Hassell, BNY Mellon’s chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  BNY Mellon was sued in federal court in  Oklahoma  by
CompSource Oklahoma, a state’s workers’ compensation insurance
company, over losses related to Sigma, the operator of a
structured investment vehicle that collapsed in September 2008.  The settlement agreement couldn’t immediately be
independently verified in court records.  The case is CompSource Oklahoma v. BNY Mellon, 08-cv-00469,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Oklahoma (Muskogee).  To contact the reporters on this story:
