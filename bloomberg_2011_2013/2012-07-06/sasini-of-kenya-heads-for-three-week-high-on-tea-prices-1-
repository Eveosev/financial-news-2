Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , Kenya’s largest coffee
and tea producer by market value, gained on speculation tea
prices will continue to climb.  The shares added as much as 2 percent to 12.50 shillings,
and closed 1.2 percent higher at 12.40 shillings in Nairobi, the
capital.  “Tea prices have rallied in the last couple of months and
they are structurally quite high and on an upward trend,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Nairobi-based investment
company Rich Management Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Rising consumption and a drop in global production will
boost prices to a record this year, according to McLeod Russel
India Ltd., the world’s biggest tea grower. African tea prices
rose to the highest in at least a year at the weekly sale in
 Kenya  on June 26 when the average price of the leaves increased
3.8 percent to $3.02 a kilogram. The leaves traded at an average
of $3 a kilogram on July 3.  Kenya is the world’s biggest producer of black tea, the
main foreign-exchange earner in east  Africa ’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
