Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  fell  the most in
two weeks in Johannesburg trading after the  Anglo American Plc (AAL) 
unit said first-half earnings will probably fall by more than
analysts estimated.  The stock declined 3.5 percent to 559.50 rand at the 5 p.m.
close, the biggest drop since June 22.  Earnings excluding one-time items are likely to be 7.1
billion rand ($864 million), or 22.10 rand a share, to 7.5
billion rand, or 23.40 rand, Kumba said in a statement today.
Earnings on that basis were 28.23 rand a share a year earlier.
The  median estimate  of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is
for 23.84 rand.  “The decrease in earnings is largely attributable to a
decrease in export  iron ore  prices in the period,” the
Johannesburg-based company said. Iron ore is used to make steel.
Detailed earnings will be released on July 20, it said.  The price of iron-ore fines imported through Tianjin port
into  China , the largest steel-making nation, fell 21 percent to
an average of $140.41 a metric ton this year from $176.63 a year
earlier, according to The Steel Index Ltd. data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
