OAO Acron, a Russian fertilizer
maker, said it bought back bonds with a nominal value of 3.41
billion rubles ($105 million) tendered by bondholders in a
company reorganization, a statement today shows.  Acron shareholders in February approved a takeover of its
Granit unit, which led to the cancellation of about 15 percent
of Acron’s treasury shares. That triggered a  put option , giving
holders of about 10 billion rubles of Acron’s bonds the right to
sell them back to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
