The rand declined for a third day
after the U.S. hired fewer workers than forecast last month and
interest-rate cuts in Europe and  China  failed to assure
investors the moves will be enough to boost economic growth.  South Africa’s currency retreated as much as 1.8 percent
and traded 1.6 percent weaker at 8.2762 per dollar by 4:19 p.m.
in Johannesburg, the worst performer of 16 major currencies
monitored by Bloomberg. The rand has declined 1.3 percent this
week. Yields on the nation’s 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 rose
four basis points to 7.14 percent.  U.S. payrolls rose 80,000 last month after a 77,000
increase in May, less than a 100,000 gain forecast in a
Bloomberg survey, Labor Department data showed. The European
Central Bank yesterday reduced its benchmark rate to a record
low of 0.75 percent and the People’s Bank of China cut borrowing
costs for a second time in a month.  “The markets have responded negatively in what appears to
be a realization that the economic downturn might be more severe
and protracted than first thought,” Quinten Bertenshaw, a
Johannesburg-based analyst at Tradition Analytics, said by e-
mail today. “For now, the potential for risk-off gathering
momentum is high.”  Three-month copper declined the most in two weeks, and
Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index  of commodities fell 1.9 percent.
Metals and other raw materials account for almost half of  South
Africa ’s exports, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
