The dollar strengthened to a two-year
high against the euro as investors sought safety after U.S.
employers added fewer jobs in June than forecast.  The greenback rose versus all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts except the yen and  Mexico ’s peso as the last U.S.
employment report before the  Federal Reserve ’s next meeting
showed the  jobless rate  stayed unchanged at 8.2 percent. The
euro also fell as a slide in Spanish industrial production added
to concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  “This report confirmed a slowdown that we’ve seen in the
last month from the U.S. and global business sectors,” Dan Dorrow, head of research in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at Faros
Trading LLC, said of the jobs data. The firm executes currency
transactions on the behalf of  hedge funds  and institutional
clients. “The overarching issue that’s led to dollar strength
today is pervasive fear that there aren’t enough policy bullets
to address the global slowdown.”  The dollar appreciated 0.8 percent to $1.2291 per euro at 5
p.m.  New York  time, extending its weekly gain to 3.1 percent,
the most since September. It touched $1.2260, the strongest
level since July 2010. The yen gained 0.3 percent to 79.66 per
dollar and climbed 1.2 percent to 97.89 per euro.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S. trade
partners, advanced as much as 0.8 percent to 83.431. It was the
highest since June 1, exceeding the 82.950 the gauge touched
yesterday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
said the euro bloc still faces risks after policy makers cut
their benchmark  interest rate  to a record 0.75 percent. The
index rallied 2 percent this week, the most since December.  Rand Tumbles  Commodity-linked currencies dropped, led by the South
African rand, which slid versus all of its 16 most-traded peers.
Stocks and commodities fell, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  losing 0.9 percent and the S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw
materials tumbling 2.4 percent.  Payrolls increased by 80,000 jobs after a revised gain of
77,000 in May, Labor Department data showed today in  Washington .
Economists projected an increase of 100,000, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Private employment,
which excludes government agencies, grew 84,000 in June, the
weakest in 10 months.  “There are two forces going on with this number,”  John Shin , senior Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of
America Corp. in New York, said in a telephone interview. “One
is the natural risk-off, dollar-positive sentiment.
Counteracting that is that a weak number further implies more
quantitative easing in the fall, which is dollar-negative.”  Debt Crisis  The greenback has gained 5.5 percent against the euro this
year as investors sought havens amid speculation Europe’s
financial turmoil was worsening and U.S. growth was slowing. The
dollar fell 2.4 percent in June against the common currency on
speculation European leaders were tackling their debt crisis.  The euro weakened earlier as Spanish industrial production
adjusted for the number of working days fell 6.1 percent in May
from a year earlier, after an 8.3 percent decline in April, the
National Statistics Institute said in  Madrid .  Spain ’s recession
probably intensified in the second quarter as Europe’s debt
crisis worsened, the central bank said on June 27.  The Spanish  10-year yield  rose as much as 26 basis points,
or 0.26 percentage point, to 7.04 percent after jumping 37 basis
points yesterday.  ‘Downside Risks’  “Downside risks to the euro-area economic outlook have
materialized,” ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday after
cutting the main refinancing rate and reducing interest on
overnight deposits to zero.  The euro slumped 7.8 percent over the past year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar gained 8.8 percent, and
the yen climbed 8.9 percent.  U.S. Treasuries rose today, pushing 10-year note  yields 
down to as low as 1.55 percent, the least in a month, as
investors sought havens.  Higher-yielding currencies fell.  South Africa ’s rand slid
1.4 percent to 8.2591 per dollar, and Norway’s krone dropped 1.1
percent to 6.1165. The Australian dollar lost 0.7 percent to
$1.0213, and New Zealand’s dollar weakened 0.7 percent to 79.77
U.S. cents.  The pound rose for a third day against the euro as traders
bet the  Bank of England ’s bond-purchase program will weigh less
on the currency than the policies of other central banks. It
gained 0.6 percent to 79.34 pence.  The  Mexican peso  gained 0.2 percent to 13.3909 per dollar
after weakening earlier as much as 0.7 percent. The U.S. is
Mexico’s biggest trade partner.  Fed Meeting  The Fed will issue its next policy statement on Aug. 1
after a two-day meeting. The central bank pumped $2.3 trillion
into the financial system from 2008 to 2011 to support the
economy in two rounds of debt purchases under quantitative
easing. It’s shifting $667 billion of short-term debt in its
holdings to longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs, a program
it expanded last month, and has kept its benchmark  interest rate 
at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 20 after the last policy
meeting that the Fed is prepared to consider additional steps to
spur growth and employment, including further asset purchases.  Policy makers last month lowered their forecasts for growth
and raised their predictions for unemployment in each of the
next three years. They now see 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent growth
in 2012, down from their April forecast of 2.4 percent to 2.9
percent. The jobless rate will end the year at 8 percent to 8.2
percent, up from 7.8 percent to 8 percent in April.  China  cut its key interest rate yesterday for the second
time in a month, and the Bank of England expanded its asset-
purchase stimulus program by 50 billion pounds ($78 billion) to
375 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
