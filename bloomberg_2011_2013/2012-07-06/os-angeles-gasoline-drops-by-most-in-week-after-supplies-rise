Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles  tumbled
against futures by the most in six days after the state Energy
Commission said inventories of the motor fuel rose for the first
time in four weeks.  Gasoline inventories  in  California  gained 8.4 percent to
6.1 million barrels in the week ended June 29 after refineries
boosted  non-California-blend gasoline stocks , for use outside
the state, the commission said yesterday. U.S. West Coast
 gasoline supplies  rose 2.7 percent to 27.9 million barrels, the
Energy Department said.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in Los Angeles
weakened for the fifth day, dropping 7.75 cents to a discount of
9.5 cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:01 p.m. East Coast time, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows. Thatâ€™s the biggest drop for the
fuel since June 27 and the largest discount since June 20.  Carbob in  San Francisco  fell 7.75 cents to 11.5 cents a
gallon below futures, also its lowest level since June 20.  Refineries in California cut  Carbob supplies  3.8 percent
last week to 4.62 million barrels and increased non-Carbob
inventories to 1.48 million barrels from 828,000 a week earlier,
the Energy Commission said in an e-mailed report.  California-blend diesel, or CARB diesel, in Los Angeles
slipped for a third day, losing 0.38 cent to a premium of 4.25
cents a gallon against Nymex heating oil futures. The same fuel
in San Francisco gained 1.5 cents to a premium of 1.5 cents a
gallon over futures.  Diesel Inventories  CARB diesel supplies  climbed 1.6 percent last week to 2.17
million barrels, the Energy Commission said.  Non-CARB diesel
inventories , for use outside the state, dropped 12 percent to 1
million barrels, the state said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
tumbled 10.5 cents to a discount of 9.5 cents a gallon against
gasoline futures, the lowest since June 21. Low-sulfur diesel
 there  fell 0.5 cent to a 7.5-cent-a-gallon premium to heating
oil futures.  Low-sulfur diesel fuel inventories  in the West Coast
slipped 2.5 percent to 10.5 million barrels last week, the
Energy Department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
