Spanish bonds slumped, pushing 10-
year yields above 7 percent for only the fifth day since the
euro was created, amid concern politicians and central banks
aren’t doing enough to prevent the region’s woes from deepening.  German two-year notes rose, sending yields to less than
zero, as investors sought the highest-rated securities after the
 European Central Bank  refrained from announcing extra measures
to stem the crisis yesterday. Austrian, Dutch, Belgian and
French note yields fell to records on demand for greater returns
than those from German securities. A negative rate means
investors who hold the debt to maturity will receive less than
they paid to buy them.  “There are still a lot of questions that remain unanswered
about the debt crisis, and we are cautious about peripheral
bonds,” said  John Stopford , head of fixed income at Investec
Asset Management in London, which oversees $98 billion. “The
market was disappointed that the ECB didn’t do more. Investors
are also nervous about the macro picture. The risk is that they
will continue to reduce exposure to peripheral bonds.”  Spain ’s 10-year yield rose 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 6.95 percent at 4:40 p.m. London time,
after climbing to 7.04 percent, the highest since June 20. The
5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 fell 1.105, or 11.05 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,230) face amount, to 92.485. The yield jumped
62 basis points this week, the most since the five days through
June 15.  ECB Cuts  The ECB cut the refinancing rate yesterday to an all-time
low of 0.75 percent and reduced the deposit rate to zero, while
stopping short of steps to cap Spanish and Italian yields. A
yield of 7 percent on 10-year debt prompted  Greece , Ireland and
 Portugal  to seek sovereign bailouts.  Spain’s bonds also declined today after a government report
showed industrial production fell for the ninth month in May.
Output at factories, refineries and mines dropped 6.1 percent
from a year earlier, after an 8.3 percent decline in April, the
National Statistics Institute said in  Madrid .  The euro depreciated 0.7 percent to $1.2301 after sliding
1.1 percent yesterday, and the rate at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for three months dropped to
a record low.  Germany ’s two-year  yield  fell three basis points to minus
0.013 percent, and reached minus 0.018 percent, the lowest since
at least 1990, when Bloomberg began compiling the data. The
yield slid below zero for the first time since June 1. The bonds
are rated AAA at  Standard & Poor’s , compared with BBB+ for
Spain.  ‘Safe Assets’  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said it temporarily closed five of its
European money-market funds to new investments after the ECB’s
deposit rate cut. The biggest U.S. bank said in a  notice  to
shareholders that it won’t accept new investors or money in five
euro-denominated money-market and liquidity funds.  German bonds extended gains after a U.S. report showed
employers hired fewer workers in June than economists forecast,
supporting demand for haven assets. Payrolls rose 80,000 after a
77,000 increase in May. Economists projected a 100,000 gain.  The  10-year bund yield  dropped five basis points to 1.33
percent, extending this week’s decline to 25 basis points. It
reached a record-low 1.127 percent on June 1.  Austria’s two-year note yield fell as much as 12 basis
points to 0.118 percent, French yields reached 0.166 percent,
the Dutch rate touched 0.064 percent, and similar-maturity
Belgian securities yielded as little as 0.428 percent.  “Investors are looking for relatively safe assets with
some yield pickup, and that’s what French and Belgian bonds
offer,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-rate
strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “Official rates could fall further given the economic
outlook and yields on German bonds are heading toward their
record lows.”  Bond Volatility  Italian bonds declined even as Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
cabinet approved 26 billion euros of spending cuts to shore up
public finances. The yield on the 10-year security rose four
basis points to 6.02 percent.  Volatility on Austrian government debt was the highest in
developed markets today, followed by Spain, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  German government debt returned 3.1 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian debt rose
8.1 percent, while Spanish securities lost 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
