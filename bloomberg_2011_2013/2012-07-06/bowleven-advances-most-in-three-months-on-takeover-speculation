BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , the U.K.-based oil
explorer focusing on  Cameroon , jumped the most in three months
in London trading on speculation it may get a takeover offer.  BowLeven soared as much as 19 percent, the biggest gain
since March 26, and traded up 16 percent at 68 pence as of 9:30
a.m. local time.  “There are rumors it could be a bid coming in,” Andrew
Matharu, an analyst at Westhouse Securities Ltd., said after the
Financial Times reported yesterday that BowLeven was subject to
renewed takeover speculation. Its assets include the Etinde
permit in Cameroon, where it raised resource estimates in March.  BowLeven has tumbled almost 50 percent since Feb. 28, when
 Dragon Oil Plc (DGO)  said it was no longer studying an offer for the
Edinburgh-based company. The FTSE AIM All-Share Index, of which
BowLeven is a member, has dropped 16 percent in the period.  “Equity prices have been depressed while the oil price is
relatively high,” Matharu said today by telephone.  No one at BowLeven was immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
