Argentina ’s local law dollar bonds
dropped the most in almost a month after the central bank barred
individuals from buying U.S. currency for savings, deepening
foreign-exchange restrictions.  Government bonds  due in 2015, known as Bodens, dropped 2.13
cents to 78.33 cents on the dollar at 6:26 p.m. Buenos Aires
time, the most since June 11. The extra yield investors demand
to own Argentine government bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose 18
basis points to 1,071 basis points, the biggest increase in
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBIG index.  The new measure “generates fear that the government is
increasing intervention in the economy,” said Daniel Chodos, an
emerging-market strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in  New
York . The selloff reflects “the consequences of this kind of
news out of Argentina.”  Argentina’s central bank issued yesterday a list of
acceptable reasons to justify foreign currency purchases, which
doesn’t include savings. The bank said in an e-mailed statement
all dollar purchases for any reason not on the list are
“suspended.”  Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for Argentina’s economic
growth today, estimating it will slow to 2.4 percent this year,
down from a previous forecast of 3.1 percent. Tighter capital
and import controls have weakened economic activity as inflation
eroded the country’s competitiveness,  Daniel Volberg , an
economist at the firm in New York, wrote in a report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
