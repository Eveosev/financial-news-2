Nigeria ’s naira advanced for a second
day, set for its biggest weekly gain this year as oil producers
sold dollars to meet month-end expenses and the central bank
supplied the U.S. currency at auctions.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer strengthened
0.8 percent to 160.80 per dollar as of 11:55 a.m. in Lagos the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
naira is up 1.2 percent this week, the biggest gain on a closing
basis since the five days to Dec. 30.  “ Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Total SA (FP) , Addax Petroleum and some
other  oil companies  sold reasonable amounts of dollars that
complemented the central bank’s supply,” Wale Abe, chief
executive of Lagos-based Financial Markets Dealers Association,
said in a telephone interview today. Spokesmen for the oil
companies could not be reached immediately for comments.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $251 million at a foreign-
currency auction on July 4, bringing its total sales this week
to $601 million naira compared with $700 million the previous
week. Oil producers are the second major supplier after the
central bank.  Foreign-currency reserves, which rose 9.9 percent this
year, retreated to $36.529 billion, according to the latest
figures from the central bank dated July 4.  The “decline in the reserves is attributable to central
bank’s use of it to support the naira,”  Bismarck Rewane , chief
executive of Lagos-based Financial Derivatives Co., wrote in an
e-mailed note today.  Inflation  The central bank has held the  benchmark interest rate  at 12
percent this year to curb the naira’s decline and combat
inflation, after raising it 5.75 percentage points in 2011.  While  inflation  slowed to 12.7 percent in May from 12.9
percent in April, the rate is set to peak at 14.5 percent in the
third quarter, the highest since April 2010, according to the
central bank.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic 15.1 percent bonds due 2017
was unchanged at 16.06 percent, according to July 5 data on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association  website . Yields on the
nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 was unchanged at
5.499 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for the second day by 0.4 percent
to 1.9550 per dollar in Accra, the weakest level since at least
1993, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
