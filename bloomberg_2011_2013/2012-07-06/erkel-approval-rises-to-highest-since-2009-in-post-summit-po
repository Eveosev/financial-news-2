Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s approval
rating rose to the highest since 2009 as a majority of Germans
backed her handling of the euro area’s debt crisis, according to
a poll taken after last week’s  European Union  summit.  Merkel’s stance was backed by 58 percent of respondents in
the poll for ARD public television, suggesting that her rebuff
of calls by Italy and  Spain  for  Germany  to help underwrite the
entire currency union’s debt is paying off at home.  “This is another indication, if one were needed, that
Germany stood its ground at last week’s EU summit despite
perceptions that it caved in,” Nicholas Spiro, managing
director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in  London , said in an e-
mail.  The chancellor remains Germany’s most popular politician,
with 66 percent saying said she is doing a good job, eight
percentage points more than in June and the most since December
2009, according to the monthly Infratest Dimap poll released
late yesterday. A record 85 percent said the worst of the
turmoil lies ahead, ARD said in an e-mailed statement.  Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere, who was Merkel’s chief
of staff during her first term between 2005 and 2009, had the
second-highest approval rating. Frank-Walter Steinmeier,
Merkel’s Social Democratic challenger in the 2009 election, tied
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  for third place with 61
percent.  Merkel’s Christian Democratic bloc would win the largest
share of the vote, 35 percent, compared with 30 percent for the
Social Democrats, if elections were held now, according to the
poll. With 4 percent support for Merkel’s Free Democratic Party
ally and 14 percent for the Greens, which were part of a Social
Democrat-led government from 1998 to 2005, the poll indicates
that neither combination would have a majority in parliament.  The July 2-4 poll of 1,004 people had a margin of error of
3.1 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
