  Wienerberger AG (WIE)  shares fell the most
in two months after HSBC Group advised investors in a research
note to reduce the weight of the world’s biggest brickmaker in
their stock portfolios.  Wienerberger  fell  5.5 percent to 7.38 euros at the 5:30
p.m. close of trading in Vienna. The company’s full-year gain
narrowed to 6 percent, giving Wienerberger a 867.3 million-euro
($1.07 billion) market value.  HSBC, which had previously been “neutral” on Vienna-based
Wienerberger, cut the brickmaker’s stock target by 21 percent,
to 6.80 euros a share. The bank’s analysts are “forecasting
slow organic volume growth” at Wienerberger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
