Talks between  Consolidated Edison
Inc. (ED) , the supplier of electricity to most of  New York City , and
its biggest union are “pretty grim” and there’s no sign of a
resolution any time soon, a union official said.  “They sent a couple of crash-test dummies to the
negotiating table who just sit there and nod their heads,” John
Melia, a spokesman for Utility Workers Union of America Local
1-2, said in a phone interview today. Con Ed Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Kevin Burke “is playing a dangerous game that
doesn’t make economic sense.”  More than 8,000 workers have been locked out by the company
since July 1, after talks to extend their contract failed.
Negotiations, which resumed yesterday with federal mediators,
were “slow, but ongoing,” Sarah Banda, a spokeswoman for New
York-based Con Ed, said in a phone interview. The company is
using managers to fill in for the union workers.  The negotiations are taking place as  New York  City faces
some of the hottest temperatures of the year. The city is
 forecast  to reach 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) tomorrow,
according to the  National Weather Service .  “We’re always ready for anything coming our way, including
hot weather,” Banda said.  Con Ed  rose  5 cents to $62.14 at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
