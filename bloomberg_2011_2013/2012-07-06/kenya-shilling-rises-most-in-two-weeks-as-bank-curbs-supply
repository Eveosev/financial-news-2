Kenya ’s shilling rallied the most in
more than two weeks as the central bank removed money from the
market using  repurchase agreements  and term-auction deposits.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy gained as
much as 0.9 percent to 83.55 per dollar and was trading 0.3
percent stronger at 84.05 by 2:20 p.m., the biggest one-day gain
since June 20.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 3.8 billion shillings ($45
million) of repurchase agreements maturing in seven days at a
weighted average rate of 15.48 percent, an official, who asked
not to be identified in line with policy, said.  The bank also accepted 230 million shillings of bids for 14-
day term auction deposits at 15.875 percent, 1.3 billion
shillings of 21-day deposits at 15.375 percent and 1.53 billion
shillings in 28-day deposits at 15.45 percent, the official said
by telephone from Nairobi, the capital.  The longer-tenure term auction deposits introduced as
“additional instruments in liquidity management have enhanced
the open market operations and stabilised the  interbank rate 
around the central  bank rate ,” the bank’s monetary policy
committee said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  The bank cut its  benchmark lending rate  for the first time
in 18 months this week, reducing the key rate by 1.5 percentage
points to 16.5 percent to spur the economy as inflation nears
the government’s target.  The central bank raised borrowing costs by a record 12.25
percentage points in 2011 to help bolster the shilling and curb
price pressures following drought. Inflation declined for the
seventh straight month to 10.1 percent from 12.2 percent in May,
the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-mailed
statement June 29.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened the most in almost nine
months, depreciating 0.6 percent, the biggest one-day decline
since Nov 1., to 1,587 per dollar.  Uganda ’s shilling weakened
the most in almost eight weeks, declining 0.5 percent, the most
since May 15 on a closing basis, to 2,480 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
