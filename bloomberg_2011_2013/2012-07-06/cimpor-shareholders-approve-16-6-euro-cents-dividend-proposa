Cimpor-Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA 
shareholders today approved a proposal for the company to pay a
dividend of 16.6 euro cents a share, said an official at Cimpor
who asked not to be named in line with company policy.  Shareholders hadn’t voted on the dividend proposal at a
meeting on April 20 after Camargo Correa SA requested the
meeting’s suspension during its bid for the Portuguese cement
maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
