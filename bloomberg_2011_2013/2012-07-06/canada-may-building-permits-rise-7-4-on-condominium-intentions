Canadian building permits
unexpectedly rose in May, led by condominium developers, a
government report showed.  The value of permits issued by municipalities rose 7.4
percent to C$7.03 billion ($6.92 billion),  Statistics Canada 
said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
forecast a drop of 1 percent, according to the median of nine
estimates.  Residential permits advanced 8.5 percent to C$4.14 billion
on an 18 percent gain in multiple-unit construction.  Non-
residential construction  permits increased 6 percent to C$2.89
billion, Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
