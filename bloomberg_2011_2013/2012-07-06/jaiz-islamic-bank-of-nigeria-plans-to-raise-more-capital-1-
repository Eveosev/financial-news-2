Jaiz Bank Plc  of  Nigeria , which
provides Shariah-compliant banking services, said it plans to
raise 8 billion naira ($49.7 million) to expand its operations.  “We are targeting between the end of July and early August
to raise the capital,” Idris Isa, a spokesman for the Abuja-
based bank, said today in a phone interview. The funds will be
sought through private placement, he said.  Jaiz will increase its branches to 16 from three across
Africa’s top oil-producing country to offer non-interest banking
services, according to Isa. The existing branches are located in
Abuja, the capital, and the northern cities of Kano and Kaduna.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  in November issued Islamic
banking licenses to Jaiz and  Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , a unit of
South Africa’s Standard Bank Group Ltd.  The West African nation, which is the continent’s most
populous with more than 160 million people, is divided almost
evenly between a predominantly Muslim north and a mainly
Christian south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
