Uganda  plans to introduce penalties
of 10 billion shillings ($4 million) for companies guilty of
smuggling oil without a license, New Vision reported, citing the
country’s Petroleum Bill.  Individuals guilty of smuggling the resource from the
fields will be subjected to a 4 billion-shilling fine as way of
guarding against the illegal sale of the resource, the Kampala-
based newspaper reported.  Uganda is on a cusp on an oil boom after London-based
Tullow Oil Plc and its partners discovered 2.5 billion barrels
of crude. The company is jointly developing Uganda oil fields
with China National Offshore Oil Corp. and France’s Total SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
