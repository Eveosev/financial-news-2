Airbus SAS will start offering an
improved version of its twin-engine A330 wide-body that extends
its range or payload, two people familiar with the plan said.  Airbus management has signed off on the proposal, which may
be unveiled at the Farnborough Air show starting next week, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan
hasn’t been announced yet. The new version would have a maximum
takeoff weight of 240 metric tons, extending the range by about
400 nautical miles, the people said.  The company completed a detailed resource study this month
and determined it could go ahead with the A330 enhancement,
overcoming concerns that it may stretch its engineering
capabilities too far. Airbus has already said it’s talking with
 Rolls-Royce Plc (RR/) ,  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Pratt & Whitney  about
incremental improvements to the engines on the A330.  “Airframe makers always believe you can never have enough
range, and they’ve largely been proved right,” said Paul
Sheridan, the head of consultancy Asia at Ascend Worldwide Ltd.,
an aviation advisory company in London.  Airbus is working to boost production of its A330 to 11 a
month from 9.5, as airlines buy more of the aircraft partly
because  Boeing Co. (BA)  was late with its competing 787 Dreamliner.
Airbus and Boeing have both announced improved versions of their
best-selling single-aisle aircraft to make them more fuel
efficient, and Airbus is also extending the range of its A321
jets with so-called sharklets that sit on the end of the wings.  Airbus, based in Toulouse in southern France, declined to
comment.  More Weight  Boosting the maximum takeoff weight to 240 tons from 238
would allow airlines to accommodate more fuel or passengers and
let them book additional revenue from more seats or new
destinations. AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of Malaysian budget
carrier  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , is one airline interested in such a plane,
as it would allow direct flights from  Kuala Lumpur  to Paris,
Chief Executive Officer  Tony Fernandes  said in May.  Airbus wants to maintain the momentum of the A330 after the
Boeing Dreamliner entered service. The U.S. company is studying
plans to extend the 787 family with another version, the 787-10.
Airbus has won 1,199 orders for the A330, and delivered 871. The
A350-900, seating 300 passengers instead of about 250 on an
A330, is scheduled to enter service by mid 2014.  A330 customers include AirAsia X,  Korean Air (003490) , KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, a unit of  Air France (AF)  KLM Group,  Deutsche
Lufthansa (LHA)  and Iberia, a unit of  IAG International. (IAG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
