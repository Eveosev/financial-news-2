Oil fell a second day in  New York 
after the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast last month while a
planned meeting between labor unions and  oil companies  in  Norway 
signaled output disruptions may be averted.  West Texas Intermediate futures lost as much as 2.8
percent, erasing a weekly gain. Payrolls rose 80,000 last month
after a 77,000 increase in May, Labor Department figures showed
today in  Washington . Economists projected a 100,000 gain,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Norway’s Ministry of Labor said it’s called labor unions
representing striking workers and the country’s Oil Industry
Association in for a meeting in Oslo at 6 p.m. local time today.  “The growth outlook has been bleak,” said Thina Saltvedt,
an analyst at Nordea AB in Oslo, who correctly predicted the
U.S. jobs data would be lower than forecast. “We expect to see
some more soft data from the world’s largest oil consumer before
we see a turnaround for the better later this summer.”  Oil for August delivery fell as much as $2.42 to $84.80 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $84.87 at 1:43 p.m. London time, down 0.1 percent for
the week.  Brent oil for August settlement declined $2.57, or 2.6
percent, to $98.13 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark’s  premium  to West Texas
Intermediate was at $13.63, compared with $13.48 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
