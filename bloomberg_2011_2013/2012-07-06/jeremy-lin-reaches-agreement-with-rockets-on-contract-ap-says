Jeremy Lin reached an agreement with
the  Houston Rockets  on a contract, the Associated Press
reported.  Lin was offered a deal worth $10.2 million over the first
two years and $9.3 million in the third year, AP said, citing an
unidentified person with knowledge of the deal. A team option on
a fourth year is also worth $9.3 million, the report said.  Houston waived Lin in December after the Golden State
Warriors let go the undrafted guard from Harvard University. The
23-year-old was then picked up by the  New York  Knicks and rose
to prominence after taking over the running of the Knicks
offense in February.  Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  and General Manager Glen Grunwald
have said they plan to keep Lin, who averaged 14.6 points and
6.2 assists in 35 games, including 25 starts, before his season
ended because of surgery to repair torn knee cartilage.  National Basketball Association free agents can’t sign a
contract until July 11. The Knicks then have three days to match
the Rockets offer.  Knicks spokesman  Jonathan Supranowitz  declined to comment
in an e-mail. Rockets spokesman Nelson Luis didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
