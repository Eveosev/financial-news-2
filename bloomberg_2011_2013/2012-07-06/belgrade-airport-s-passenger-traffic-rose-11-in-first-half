Aerodrom Nikola Tesla AD (AERO) , the main
airport serving the Serbian capital Belgrade, said its first-
half passenger traffic rose 11 percent from a year earlier as
the number of air carriers increased.  The number of passengers advanced 1.48 million from 1.34
million a year earlier as  Qatar Airways ,  Croatia Airlines (CRALRA) , Air
One SpA,  Turk Hava Yollari AO (THYAO) , or  Turkish Airlines , and
Norwegian Air Shuttle AS started new flights or increased
frequency, the state-controlled airport said on its website. The
number of flights rose 1.8 percent to 21,361, while cargo
traffic dropped 2.3 percent to 3,393 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
