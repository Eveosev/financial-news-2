(Corrects dollar amount in headline, second paragraph.)  The All England Lawn Tennis Club is
issuing five-year debentures, or bonds, that entitle holders to
a Centre Court ticket for the current Wimbledon tennis
championships, according to  SmartMoney .  The club’s debentures are trading in London for 66,000
pounds ($103,000) each, according to Michael Dyson of  Investec
Plc (INVP) , who handles debenture transactions. The debentures
originally cost $43,000 when first issued two years ago,
SmartMoney said.  There are 2,500 Centre Court debentures and 1,000 Number
One Court coupons on the market, with four years of life left in
them, according to SmartMoney.  The tennis club has partially funded itself since 1920 by
issuing debentures, allowing it to refurbish courts and improve
the club’s facilities. Wimbledon tickets acquired at the box
office or through agencies are highly oversubscribed and cannot
be sold or transferred to another person, so buying debentures
is the only way for outsiders to gain access to the courts,
SmartMoney reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
