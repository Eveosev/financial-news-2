Centrica Plc (CNA)  urged the U.K. 
government to relax planning rules after its application to 
build a 540-megawatt offshore wind farm was turned down
following a three-year wait.  The Department of Energy and Climate Change cited the
“potential impact” on seabirds for rejecting the proposed
Docking Shoal project, for which Centrica said it incurred
“considerable costs.”  The government needs to eliminate “undue constraints” 
from the planning process if Britain’s target to get 15 percent
of its energy from clean power sources by 2020 is to be met, 
the Windsor, England-based company said today in a statement. 
It was the first time an application for an offshore park has 
been turned down in the U.K.  Centrica’s 580-megawatt Race Bank project off the
Lincolnshire and north Norfolk coasts was approved. It expects
to make a final  investment decision  on Race Bank early next
year.  The project’s economics depend on the outcome of the
government’s review of subsidies for renewable-energy projects,
expected before parliament breaks on July 17, according to
Centrica.  Separately, Warwick Energy, a U.K. energy developer, said 
it won permission to build its 1.5 billion-pound ($2.3 billion) 
Dudgeon offshore wind farm. The 560-megawatt venture could 
power 400,000 households, equivalent to all the homes in 
Norfolk, according to the company.  Warwick Energy plans to get private-sector funding for the
venture in the next 12 months.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
