Ethanol futures fell in  Chicago  after
a government report that showed fewer jobs than expected were
added in June sparked concern that  economic growth  may slow,
curbing fuel demand.  Prices snapped a four-day streak of gains after Labor
Department data showed June payrolls climbed 80,000 after a
77,000 increase in May. That compares to a 100,000 gain
projected by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Energy futures declined as weak U.S. job numbers
strengthened anxiety that a frail global economy will put more
pressure on demand,” SCB & Associates LLC wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients today.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 3.6 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $2.404 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest decline since June 21. Prices have increased 9.1
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast added 3
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.545 a gallon and in  New York  the
fuel advanced 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.48, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf declined 2 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $2.44 a gallon and in Chicago the additive slipped 0.5 cent
to $2.385.  Oil for August delivery fell $2.77, or 3.2 percent, to
settle at $84.45 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Crude, which fell 0.6 percent this week, is down 15 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
