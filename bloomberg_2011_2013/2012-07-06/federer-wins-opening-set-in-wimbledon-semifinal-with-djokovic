Six-time champion  Roger Federer  won
the third set to take a 2-1 lead over defending champion Novak Djokovic in their semifinal at Wimbledon.  The 30-year-old from Switzerland, who won the first set
6-3, took the third 6-4 by breaking Djokovic, a 25-year-old from
Serbia. Djokovic won the second set 6-3.  Theyâ€™re playing under a closed roof on Centre Court because
of rain in London. Federer will take over the world No. 1
ranking with a victory in the final, and has never lost a
semifinal at the All England Club. Djokovic is trying to be the
first man since Federer in 2007 to defend the title at
Wimbledon.  The winner will take on the winner of the match between
 Andy Murray  of Britain and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of  France .  To contact the reporter on this story:
