South  Korea ’s won is poised for a
sixth weekly advance, the longest winning streak since October
2010, on optimism policy makers in the world’s biggest economies
will address a global slump.  Government bonds  rose.  The People’s Bank of  China  announced its second interest-
rate cut in month late yesterday, supporting demand in South
Korea’s biggest export market. The  European Central Bank  also
lowered borrowing costs and the  Bank of England  expanded a bond
purchase program. Overseas investors bought $182 million more
Korean stocks than they sold in the last four days after
government data showed Korean exports rose in June for the first
time in four months.  The won climbed 0.6 percent this week to 1,138.40 per
dollar at 9:01 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It fell 0.3 percent today. The won’s one-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, declined 28 basis points this week to 7.40
percent.  “Foreign money keeps flowing into Korean stocks and this,
coupled with demand from exporters, pushed the won higher this
week,” said Lee Jung Hyun, a currency dealer at state-run
 Industrial Bank of Korea (024110)  in Seoul. “The market’s reaction to
China’s rate cut is muted with traders largely keeping a nervous
eye on what’s going on in Europe.”  Samsung Electronics Co., South Korea’s biggest exporter,
posted a record quarterly profit today that beat analyst
estimates as surging sales of Galaxy smartphones helped it
challenge Apple Inc.’s iPhone. Operating profit totaled 6.7
trillion won ($5.9 billion) in the second quarter, a 79 percent
jump from a year ago, the company said.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this week
to 3.36 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. It declined
one basis point today. Three-year debt futures rose 0.17 to
104.85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
