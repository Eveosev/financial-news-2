Chinese police broke up child-
trafficking rings in 15 provinces and arrested more than 800
people after babies were auctioned off to the highest bidder for
up to 50,000  yuan  ($7,800).  Footage aired on Chinese television today showed a police
officer involved in the raids wresting a child away from a woman
who had allegedly bought it. Suspects and other rescued children
were also shown being taken away by police.  The July 2 raids involved 10,000 police and resulted in 181
children being freed and 802 arrests, the Ministry of Public
Security said in  a statement  on its website yesterday.  China ’s
one-child policy and a tradition of favoring boys have been
cited as contributing to the nation’s trafficking problems.  A doctor at a clinic in  Hebei province  organized a trade in
which pregnant women sold their children for up to 50,000 yuan
depending on the baby’s gender and health, and its parents’
appearance, the Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday.  A suspect who had allegedly helped in the trafficking of
more than 100 children was also arrested, the ministry said in
the statement. It said police first became aware of one child-
trafficking ring in  Henan province  when four suspects were found
on a bus traveling with babies they intended to sell.  China started a campaign in 2009 to combat trafficking,
freeing 18,000 children and 34,000 women in that time. The U.S.
State Department’s 2011  Trafficking in Persons Report  said that
while China has increased attention to trafficking of women and
children, “the government did not demonstrate evidence of
significant efforts to address all forms of trafficking or
effectively protect victims.”  Some families from rural farming communities sell their
female babies for cash because boys are considered more valuable
at home.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
