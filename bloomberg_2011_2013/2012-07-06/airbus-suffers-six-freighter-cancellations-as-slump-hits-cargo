Airbus SAS (EAD)  lost six A330-200F
freighters from its order tally last month as a shrinking air-
cargo market prompts a spate of cancellations.  Airbus’s order and delivery figures for June, posted on its
website today, omit the contract from U.S. investment firm
MatlinPatterson Global Advisers LLC placed in 2008 and listed in
May numbers from the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer.  The move brings A330-200F cancellations for the year to
eight aircraft after U.S. lessor Intrepid Aviation switched two
contracts to passenger variants earlier this year.  The order book for Airbus’s only new-build freighter has
declined from a high of 72 planes in 2008 to 52 last month, of
which 13 have been delivered. Cargo traffic fell 1.9 percent in
May, the most recent month for which data is available,
according to the  International Air Transport Association .  Airbus booked 104 orders in June: 100 A320neo narrow-bodies
from Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, a purchase originally revealed
in January, and four A380s from  Russia ’s OAO  TransAero Airlines (TAER) ,
first announced last October. The order intake for 2012 reached
253 aircraft, or 230 net of cancellations, lagging behind U.S.
rival  Boeing Co. (BA) , which has racked up 476 gross orders and 440
net as the new 737 MAX narrow-body spurs sales.  Airbus deliveries in the first six months reached 279
aircraft, including 10 double-decker A380s. That’s ahead of last
year’s mid-year figure, though behind Boeing’s 287.  Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, the  Middle East ’s third-
largest carrier, also converted six A320 orders to larger A321s.  Airbus and Boeing are both likely to get an order boost
next week at the U.K.’s Farnborough Air Show, the year’s biggest
aerospace expo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
