U.K. Treasury Minister  Mark Hoban 
said he wants to loosen funding rules for mutual lenders as he
seeks to provide an alternative to traditional banks.  The Treasury proposed amending the Building Societies Act
to “widen opportunities” for those lenders. They will be asked
to erect firewalls around their retail operations and bring
loss-absorbency rules in line with those of traditional banks
while their lending and funding requirements will be relaxed.  “The government has committed to increasing choice and
diversity in financial services,” Hoban said in a  statement 
released by his office in  London  today. “Building societies can
play a vital role in this. The proposals we are setting out
today provide a real opportunity for societies to expand their
services and attract a new generation of consumers.”  The plans are part of a wider program outlined by former
Bank of England Chief Economist  John Vickers  that aims to make
Britain’s banking sector less reliant on public money during
times of financial stress. Hoban said he wants a “more level
playing field” with mutuals so that they can provide a greater
challenge to banks.  The Treasury said in a consultation document that it’s open
to reconsidering rules that specify that at least 50 percent of
a mutual’s funding has to be in the form of retail deposits, a
definition that doesn’t include deposits from small and medium-
sized businesses, and that at least 75 percent of lending has to
be secured on homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
