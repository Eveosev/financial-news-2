The European Commission said a
bilateral contract between  Romania ’s hydro-power generator
Hidroelectrica SA and a local unit of  Arcelor Mittal (MT)  may have
included undue state aid for the steel-producer.  A preliminary conclusion of the European Union’s
competition regulators said that an alleged loss of revenue
incurred by Hidroelectrica after signing contracts to sell
electricity to Arcelor Mittal in 2009 and 2010 is attributable
to the Romanian state, according to the  statement  published in
the EU’s official journal. The state, as a majority shareholder,
was directly involved in the approval of the 2010 contract.  “It seems that ArcelorMittal Galați, and possibly also the
other four members of the ArcelorMittal group in Romania, may
have derived an undue advantage in the form of being supplied
electricity at prices below market levels on the basis of the
contracts with Hidroelectrica,” the Commission said in the
statement. “All unlawful aid can be subject to recovery from
the recipient.”  The  International Monetary Fund  and the EU have asked
Romania to renegotiate Hidroelectrica’s contracts after the EU
competition regulator started its investigation into possible
state aid. The investigation also includes bilateral contracts
with  Alro SA (ALR) , a Romanian smelter. Hidroelectrica entered an
insolvency procedure last month after the government said it
plans to restructure the company and increase its efficiency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
