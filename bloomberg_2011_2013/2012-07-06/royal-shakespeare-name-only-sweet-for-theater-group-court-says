Juliet asked Romeo, “What’s in a
name?” in one of  William Shakespeare ’s most famous plays. A
European Union court ruled quite a lot is in a name, upholding
the  Royal Shakespeare Company ’s EU-wide rights to its moniker.  The EU General Court sided today with the theater company
against Graz, Austria-based Jackson International Trading Co.
Kurt D. Bruehl GmbH & Co. KG, which won the EU trademark rights
in 2003 to use the Royal Shakespeare name for catering, food,
alcohol and water.  The Austrian company “would benefit from the power of
attraction, the reputation and the prestige” of the Royal
Shakespeare name, the EU’s second-highest court  ruled . The
connotative link to the theater company “would give the
applicant a commercial advantage over its competitors’ goods.”  Jackson International appealed after losing the rights in a
2009 decision by the EU’s trademark agency. The appeals board of
the Office for Harmonization for the Internal Market had
 overturned  the Austrian company’s claim because of the “strong
likelihood” that it could “free ride” on the theater
company’s “immense success and reputation in the U.K.”  Jackson International didn’t immediately respond to calls
for comment on the decision.  Today’s ruling can be appealed to the  EU Court of Justice 
in Luxembourg.  The case is:  T-60/10 , Jackson International v. OHIM - Royal
Shakespeare Company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
