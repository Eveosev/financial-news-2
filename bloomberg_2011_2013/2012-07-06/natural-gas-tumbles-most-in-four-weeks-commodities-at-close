The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24  raw materials  fell 2.4 percent to settle at 605.15 at 4:17
p.m. in New York, led by natural gas.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26  prices  declined 1.9
percent to 1,497.39.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas declined the most in four weeks on forecasts
for milder weather. Earlier, the price reached $3 per million
British thermal units for the first time in six months.  MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted
mostly normal temperatures in the southern and eastern U.S.
following warmer-than-normal weather through July 10.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , gas futures for August
delivery slumped 5.7 percent to $2.776 per million Btu, the
biggest drop since June 7.  U.K. gas was little changed as  Norway ’s Ministry of Labor
summoned unions and the industry’s employer group in an attempt
to settle a dispute that threatens a production slowdown.  July 9 gas traded at 58.4 pence a therm at 4:23 p.m. London
time, versus 58.45 pence a therm yesterday. August gas weakened
0.8 percent to 56.95 pence. That’s equivalent to $8.82 per
million Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell for the second straight day after a report
showed U.S. employers hired fewer workers than forecast in June,
increasing concern that slower economic growth will reduce
energy demand.  On the Nymex, oil futures for August delivery slid 3.2
percent to $84.45 a barrel.  Brent oil for August declined 2.5 percent to $98.19 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  Morgan Stanley bought one cargo of North Sea Forties after
the blend rose to a three-month high amid a drop in August
shipments. Exports of the crude for next month will be at the
lowest in at least five years, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed.  BP Plc failed to sell Russian Urals crude in northwest
Europe at a higher price.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline slid as U.S. employers added fewer jobs than
projected in June, increasing concerns that the economic
recovery is stalling and fuel demand won’t improve.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for August delivery dropped
1.8 percent to $2.716 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for August delivery fell 2.1 percent to
$2.7099 a gallon.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn futures fell from a nine-month high and wheat dropped
on speculation that grain demand will ebb. Soybeans slid.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for December
delivery fell 2.2 percent to $6.93 a bushel, the first drop in a
week and the biggest since June 21. Prices yesterday reached
$7.13, the highest for a most-active contract since Sept. 15.  Wheat futures for September delivery tumbled 3.8 percent to
$8.0625 a bushel.  Soybean futures for November delivery declined 1.4 percent
to $15.0575 a bushel.  BASE METALS  Copper slumped the most in two weeks as a report showing
slower-than-forecast job gains in the U.S. fueled concern that
the economic recovery will falter, eroding demand for raw
materials.  On the Comex in  New York , copper futures for September
delivery fell 2.4 percent to $3.4095 a pound, the biggest drop
since June 21.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months tumbled 2.1 percent to $7,531 a metric ton ($3.42 a
pound).  Aluminum, nickel, lead, zinc and tin also slid on the LME.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined the most in two weeks as the dollar’s rally
eroded demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  On the Comex, gold futures for August delivery fell 1.9
percent to $1,578.90 an ounce, the biggest drop for a most-
active contract since June 21.  Silver futures for September delivery slipped 2.7 percent
to $26.92 an ounce.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for October delivery dropped
1.9 percent to $1,449.50 an ounce. Palladium futures for
September delivery fell 0.9 percent to $580.35 an ounce.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Sugar rose, capping the second straight weekly gain, on
speculation that supplies will remain limited after rain hurt
crops in  Brazil , the world’s biggest producer.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, raw sugar for October
delivery advanced 1.5 percent to 22.25 cents a pound. The price
jumped 5.9 percent since June 29 after climbing 6.4 percent the
previous week.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery retreated 2.2
percent to $1.7645 a pound.  Cocoa futures for September delivery fell 3.3 percent to
$2,252 a ton.  Cotton futures for December delivery increased 0.1 percent
to 70.62 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery jumped 1.8
percent to $1.271 a pound.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures rose on speculation that pork supplies will
decline as excessive heat across the U.S. causes animals to lose
weight.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for August
settlement climbed 0.5 percent to 93.3 cents a pound. The price
has risen 11 percent in 2012.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $1.192 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement advanced 0.4
percent to $1.46525 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
