Rain in the harvest season in  Brazil ,
the biggest coffee producer in the world, boosted prices on July
3 to the biggest level since May 18, to $1.8045 a pound for the
September contract, according to the National Coffee Council, a
producing association.  Concerns over the sustainability of world coffee
consumption may reduce strength of the price rally, said the
association, known as CNC. in a weekly report sent by e-mail
today.  Rain in the producing areas also affected the quality of
coffee beans and have delayed harvesting, CNC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
