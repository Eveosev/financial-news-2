Greece â€™s public revenue in the first
six months of the year was about 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion)
less than its budget target for the period after it dropped 1.5
percent compared with the year earlier,  Kathimerini  reported,
without saying how it got the information.  Net revenue increased 1 percent in June compared with the
same month in 2011, while total revenue for the month, which is
before tax refunds, declined 0.5 percent from June 2011, the
Athens-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
