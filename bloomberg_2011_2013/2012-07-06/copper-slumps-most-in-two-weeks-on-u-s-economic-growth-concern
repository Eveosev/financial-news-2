Copper slumped the most in two weeks
as a report showing slower-than-forecast job gains in the U.S.
fueled concern that the economic recovery will falter, eroding
demand for raw materials.  Payrolls expanded by 80,000 in June, the U.S. Labor
Department reported today, less than the 100,000-job increase
forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The European Central Bank
yesterday reduced its benchmark  interest rate  to a record of
0.75 percent to spur growth, and the People’s Bank of China cut
borrowing costs for a second time in a month. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities tumbled the most in two
weeks, while the dollar rose to the highest against a basket of
six currencies since June 1.  “Many people are asking their clients to move to cash for
the second half of the year as the outlook is getting worse,”
 Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures and Options in  Port
St. Lucie , Florida, said in a telephone interview.  Copper futures for September delivery fell 2.4 percent to
settle at $3.4095 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
the biggest drop since June 21 and a weekly decline of 2.5
percent. Prices may slip to $3.30, Smith said, without giving a
time frame.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months tumbled 2.1 percent to $7,531 a metric ton ($3.42 a
pound.).  Tin slumped 2.1 percent, the biggest fall since May 30,
while nickel slipped 3.3 percent, the most in more than two
weeks. Aluminum, lead, and zinc also declined in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
