Spain ´s Budget Ministry will withhold
funds to 2,100 town halls that have unpaid bills with suppliers
and that haven´t signed up to a repayment plan put in place by
the government earlier this year,  Cinco Dias  reported.  The funds will be withheld for at least five years and that
period could be extended until town halls settle their debts and
pay all interest due,  Cinco Dias  said, citing Spain´s official
government bulletin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
