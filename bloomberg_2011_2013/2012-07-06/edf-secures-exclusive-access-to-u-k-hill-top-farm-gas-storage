Electricite de France SA said after
talks with Britain’s energy regulator it secured exclusive
rights to use the Hill Top Farm natural-gas storage site in the
U.K. when it starts this year.  Operations at the 234 gigawatt-hour facility in Cheshire,
northwest  England , are currently suspended for further
commissioning after use last winter, EDF said in an e-mailed
statement. Two caverns will be in use by the end of the year.  The site will have 10 underground gas-storage caverns when
completed in 2017 with a storage capacity of 1,070 gigawatt-
hours. That’s about 100 million cubic meters of gas, or a
quarter of peak winter daily demand in Britain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
