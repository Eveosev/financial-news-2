Grupo Pochteca SAB (POCHTECB) , the chemical
distributor controlled by the family of billionaire Antonio  del
Valle , posted its biggest two-day rally in three years on
optimism the company’s expansion plan will bolster profits.  Pochteca  jumped  18 percent to 3.17 pesos in Mexico City
trading, pushing the two-day advance to 33 percent, the biggest
two-day rally since May 2009 and the highest closing price since
September 2008. Daily volume climbed to 15 million shares, 25
times the average for the past three months and the highest
since 2008. The stock exchange temporarily suspended trading
today until Pochteca said in a regulatory filing that it had
nothing further to disclose.  Del Valle said in an interview with Bloomberg News
published yesterday that he would seek to have Pochteca emulate
the acquisition-driven growth strategy that triggered a decade-
long rally at his chemical maker, Mexichem SAB.  “I’m probably going to ask my analysts to start following
the company because there could be value there,” said Jorge Lagunas, who oversees about $200 million in equities as a  money
manager  at Mexico City-based Grupo Financiero Interacciones SA.  Pochteca has gained 80 percent since Oct. 21, when the
company named Ricardo Gutierrez, an ex-Mexichem chief executive
officer, as chairman of the board. The company also hired former
Mexichem finance chief Armando Vallejo as chief financial
officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
