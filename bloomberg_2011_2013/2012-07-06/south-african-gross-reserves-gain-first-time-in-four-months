South Africa ’s gold and foreign
currency reserves climbed for the first time in four months as
the price of bullion rose and the dollar weakened, boosting the
value of reserves in euro and other currencies.  Gross reserves  gained 0.6 percent to $49.2 billion in June,
the Pretoria-based Reserve Bank said on its website today. Net
reserves advanced to $47.9 billion from $47.7 billion.  “The increase in gross reserves was primarily due to
valuation adjustments emanating from the higher  U.S. dollar  gold
price and depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major
currencies,” the bank said in the statement.  The dollar dropped against 14 of the 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg in June, while the price of gold rose 2.4
percent last month, the first increase in five months. The
central bank holds most of its reserves in euros, dollars and
pounds.  The  Reserve Bank  said on July 4 it posted the third
consecutive annual loss in the year through March because of the
cost of building reserves. The bank earns a lower return on its
foreign-currency holdings than it pays on domestic bonds it
buys, resulting in a loss.  Gold reserves rose 1.7 percent to $6.4 billion in June,
accounting for 13 percent of gross reserves.  The rand was at 8.1833 against the dollar as of 9:02 a.m.
in Johannesburg from 8.1572 before the data was released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
