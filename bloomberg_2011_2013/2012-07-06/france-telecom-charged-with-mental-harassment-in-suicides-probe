France Telecom SA (FTE)  was charged with
mental harassment by a judge who is leading an investigation
into employee suicides and depression at the country’s largest
phone company.  France Telecom  was charged today by Judge Pascal Gand in an
investigation sparked by a labor union complaint that
reorganization efforts to make the former monopoly more
competitive had contributed to workers’ psychological issues,
the company said.  France Telecom “denies having put in place a policy
deliberately aimed at causing suffering in the workplace in
order to encourage people to leave,” according to an e-mailed
statement by the company.  France Telecom suspended its restructuring plans in 2009
and Chief Executive Officer  Didier Lombard  stepped down in 2010
after more than 30 people killed themselves as the company
struggled to cope with intensifying competition. Most of the
workers when Lombard left had protected status that made it
difficult to fire them and the company instead gave employees
meaningless jobs to force them out, driving some to take their
own lives, the unions said.  Lombard was charged earlier this week as well with mental
harassment. He denied the allegations in an open letter posted
on the Le Monde website on July 4.  “At no point were these plans conceived and put in place
by France Telecom directed against employees,” Lombard wrote in
a statement to the newspaper. “They were meant to save the
company and its employees, and to open up new career paths in
the new digital world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
