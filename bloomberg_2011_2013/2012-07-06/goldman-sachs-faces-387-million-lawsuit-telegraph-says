Goldman Sachs (GS)  Group Inc.’s asset
management arm is facing a 313 million euro ($387 million)
lawsuit over its handling of a Dutch pension fund at the height
of the financial crisis, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Pensioenfonds Vervoer, which has assets of 7 billion euros,
is suing the bank over the way the unit managed the pension
funds. The writ could be filed as early as today in London’s
High Court, according to the Telegraph. An unidentified
spokesman for Goldman’s asset management arm said the lawsuit
would be contested because any claim would be without merit, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
