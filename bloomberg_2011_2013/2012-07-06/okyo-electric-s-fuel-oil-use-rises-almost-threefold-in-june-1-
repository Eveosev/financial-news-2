Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s  fuel-oil 
consumption increased nearly three-fold in June because of a
higher dependence on thermal power generation after the
Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The utility known as Tepco used 539,000 kiloliters of fuel
oil last month, up from 192,000 kiloliters in the same period
last year, according to data released today on its website.  Tepco’s crude oil consumption more than doubled to 231,000
kiloliters, while coal use increased about 13 percent to 211,000
metric tons. Liquefied-natural-gas consumption fell about 6
percent to 1.7 million tons.  Japan ended a two-month period without an operating reactor
on July 1 when a unit at  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503) ’s Ohi plant
in western Japan was restarted. Tepco has had no operating
reactors since it halted the No. 6 reactor at its Kashiwazaki
Kariwa atomic station in northwest  Japan ’s Niigata prefecture on
March 26 for scheduled maintenance.  The following table shows Tepco’s consumption and purchases
of fuel oil, crude, LNG and coal for June. For fuel oil and
crude, the volume is in kiloliters while LNG and coal are in
tons.
