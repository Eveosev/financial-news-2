Solar Impulse, Switzerland’s
experimental sun-powered aircraft that uses no fuel, flew back
to Europe today from the Moroccan city of Rabat, taking off at
dawn with a landing expected about midnight in Madrid, Spain.  The single-pilot craft with a wingspan of an Airbus 340 has
been flown on alternative legs by Bertrand Piccard and Andre
Borschberg, powered by 12,000 solar cells integrated into the
wing that supply four 10-horsepower motors with the energy that
charges  lithium batteries  during the day and allows the plane to
fly all night.  The carbon-fiber HB-SIA has traveled more than 4,000
kilometers (2,500 miles) without fuel since May 24 from a
military field at Payerne outside the Swiss capital of Bern via
Madrid, passing Gibraltar, to the southern Morocco desert town
of Ouarzazate over the Atlas Mountains.  The craft flew north along Morocco’s Atlantic coast into
southern Spain today and followed a course near the Portugal-
Spain border at altitudes up to 7,800 meters (25,700 feet) with
an average speed of about 48 kilometers per hour, Solar
Impulse’s website showed.  “With this flight to Morocco, we have validated the
capacity of the airplane to fly through difficult regions,”
said Borschberg, co-founder of Solar Impulse.  The 100 million-franc ($102 million) Solar Impulse project
has been supported by  Solvay SA (SOLB) , Swatch Group’s Omega,  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  and Schindler Holding AG along with  Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s Material
Science unit,  Altran Technologies SA (ALT) ,  Swisscom AG (SCMN) , the EPFL
institute in Lausanne and  Dassault Aviation SA. (AM)   Piccard and co-pilot  Brian Jones  in 1999 became the first
to fly around Earth in a hot-air balloon, starting from
Switzerland and landing almost 20 days later in Egypt. Solar
Impulse organizers hope to pilot a new model of the sun-powered
craft around the world in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
