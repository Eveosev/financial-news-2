Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM)  and Kiran
Energy Solar Power Pvt. will get a $57 million loan from the
U.S. Export-Import Bank for a solar power plant in  India ’s
Rajasthan state.  The board of the Washington-based lender has approved the
loan for the 50-megawatt solar project under development by
Kiran and Mahindra Solar One, said Ardeshir Contractor, managing
director and chief executive officer of Kiran. Mahindra Solar
One is a venture between Kiran and India’s biggest maker of
sports-utility vehicles.  The 14-year loan will have a fixed rate based on the
prevailing U.S. Treasury bond rate, Contractor said in an e-mail
late yesterday.  Kiran, whose investors include Bessemer Venture Partners,
an early funder of Skype Technologies SA, has completed a 20-
megawatt solar photovoltaic plant in Gujarat state. Mahindra
Solar One and Kiran also built a five-megawatt project in
Rajasthan state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
