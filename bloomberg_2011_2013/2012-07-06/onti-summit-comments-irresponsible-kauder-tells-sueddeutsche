Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti’s
interpretation of the outcome of last week’s European Union
summit in Brussels was “irresponsible,”  Volker Kauder , the
floor leader of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic
Union, told the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  “Mario Monti’s behavior that morning wasn’t appropriate,
in my opinion,” Kauder told the newspaper. Monti’s comments led
to the wrong perception “that many believe that he won and that
the chancellor lost.”  The EU needs to change the way it works, Kauder said,
criticizing leaders for meeting for summits in the late
afternoon and negotiating all night, allowing anybody to make
unverifiable statements in the early hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
