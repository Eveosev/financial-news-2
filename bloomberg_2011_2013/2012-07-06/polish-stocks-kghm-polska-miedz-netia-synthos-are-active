Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  gained 0.1
percent to 2,288.65 as of 12:37 p.m. in Warsaw, extending this
week’s advance to 0.6 percent.  The following are among the most active equities on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s only copper miner,
declined 1.3 percent to 151 zloty, snapping a five-day winning
streak. Copper slumped for a third day in London before a report
that may round out the weakest quarter for employment in more
than two years in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest consumer
of the metal.  Netia SA (NET)   fell as much as 1.7 percent before
trading 0.2 percent lower to 5.89 zloty after ING Groep NV
recommended selling share of Poland’s second-largest fixed-line
phone company. ING cut its recommendation from buy, citing
increased competition and a market slowdown.  Synthos SA (SNS)   advanced 2.1 percent to 6.26 zloty. The
management of state-controlled  Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy SA (ZAP)  , Poland’s biggest fertilizer producer, is recommending
shareholders reject a takeover bid from Synthos because the
offer price of 102.50 zloty a share is “significantly below”
fair value, the company said in a regulatory statement after the
market close yesterday. Pulawy gained 0.1 percent to 103 zloty.  To contact the reporters on this story:
