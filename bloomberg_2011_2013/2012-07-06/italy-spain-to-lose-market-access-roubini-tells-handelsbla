Italy and Spain will lose access to
 capital markets  in three to six months as European leaders
struggle to stamp out the debt crisis,  New York  University
professor Nouriel Roubini was quoted as saying by Handelsblatt.  Roubini was asked how much time the euro has left,
according to an interview published in the German newspaper
today. While last weekâ€™s European Union summit bought time for
the 17-country euro area, the relief will be short-lived, he was
quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
