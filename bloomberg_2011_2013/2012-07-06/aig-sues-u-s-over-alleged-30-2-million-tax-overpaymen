American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
which was taken over by the federal government in 2008, sued the
U.S. seeking $30.2 million for an alleged overpayment of taxes
for 1991.  The lawsuit, filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims in Washington, notes that the insurance company is
attempting to resolve underpayments and overpayments of taxes
through 1999. The refund request has been pending before the
 Internal Revenue Service  since 2007, according to the complaint.  “AIG is bringing this action to protect itself against the
running of the six-year statute of limitations on suing for
additional overpayment interest before final resolution of its
tax liabilities for 1997, 1998 and 1999,” Charles Ruchelman, a
lawyer for AIG, wrote in the complaint.  The U.S. has a 61 percent stake in AIG, down from more than
90 percent, after a 2008 rescue that swelled to $182.3 billion.  The case is American International Group Inc. v. U.S., 12-
00437, U.S. Court of Federal Claims ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
