America Movil SAB’s Telmex unit lost
a lawsuit seeking to force the government to grant it a license
to offer pay-TV service, El Universal newspaper columnist
Maricarmen Cortes  said .  An appeals court ruled yesterday that the Communications
and Transporation Ministry had the authority to reject Telmex’s
petition for a license, Cortes said, citing Gerardo Sanchez
Henkel, the ministry’s legal director. The decision can’t be
appealed, she said.  It’s unclear whether, after yesterday’s ruling, Mexico’s
 Supreme Court  will find it necessary to take up a separate case
over whether the ministry erred in denying the license, the
columnist said, citing unidentified lawyers.  Telmex can renew its request for a license with the
ministry, as long as it’s willing to accept rules on network
connections with competitors, Cortes said.  A press official at the ministry, who asked not to be named
because of internal policy, confirmed the ruling and said he
didn’t immediately have more information. A Telmex official, who
asked not to be identified because of company policy, declined
to comment.  Telmex’s formal name is Telefonos de Mexico SAB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
