How's this for prescient? Check out the first couple of paragraphs of a Bloomberg News article from May 29, 2008, under  the headline , "Libor Banks Misstated Rates, Bond at Barclays Says." (Yes, the article ran more than four years before Barclays's $453 million settlement last month with U.S. and U.K. authorities for manipulating Libor.) The story begins: Later, the article says: Bond's TV appearance came the same day as a front-page Wall Street Journal  article  that showed several large banks, including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., had been "reporting significantly lower borrowing costs" for Libor "than what another market measure suggests they should be." (The market measure the Journal cited was the cost for credit-default insurance.) Both articles came up during discussion at a July 4 hearing where former Barclays Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  testified to a U.K. parliamentary panel. "So in May 2008 you have a strategist in your own organization who is stating that these borrowing costs have been misstated," said Jesse Norman, a member of the Treasury Select Committee, after reading aloud from the Bloomberg article. "How could it be possible that you couldn't have been aware of it at that time and indeed actively under some internal obligation to launch an investigation?" Diamond dodged the question. "This isn't just Barclays, and you keep coming back to Barclays," he said. To which  Norman  replied: "Well, that's the institution for which you were responsible." Later Diamond said to Norman: "I'm not excusing that behavior. But I think it's also appropriate for the committee to step back and say that it was a financial crisis and that there are broader industry implications. And all I'm saying is look at the behavior of Barclays in the context of what we did about it once we found out." It doesn't look good. As Bloomberg View noted in an  editorial today , Diamond claimed at the hearing that he learned only last month about e-mails showing that his bank had made false submissions on  interest rates  used to set Libor.
