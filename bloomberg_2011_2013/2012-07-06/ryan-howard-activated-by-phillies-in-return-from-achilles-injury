First baseman  Ryan Howard  had two
hits after being activated by the Philadelphia Phillies for the
first time this year following offseason surgery on his Achilles
tendon.  Howard recorded his hits in four plate appearances last
night for the Phillies, who lost 5-0 to the  Atlanta Braves .  To make room for Howard, a three-time All-Star, the
Phillies optioned infielder Hector Luna to triple-A Lehigh
Valley, the team said in a news release.  Howard, 32, ruptured his left Achilles on the Philliesâ€™
final play last year, collapsing while trying to run to first
base on a groundout that ended the National League Division
Series against the  St. Louis Cardinals .  A career .275 hitter, Howard has 286 home runs and 864 runs
batted in over eight seasons in Philadelphia.  He played in seven minor-league rehabilitation games, going
10-for-20 with one home run, two doubles and 10 RBI.  The Phillies, who activated All-Star second baseman  Chase Utley  for the first time this season on June 27, are 37-48, 13
games behind the division-leading Washington Nationals in the NL
East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
