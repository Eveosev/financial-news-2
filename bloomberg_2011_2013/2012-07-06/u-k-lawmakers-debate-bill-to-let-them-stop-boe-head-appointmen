British lawmakers are today debating
whether Parliament should have the power to block the
appointment of the governor of the  Bank of England .  The private member’s bill, a type of draft legislation
sponsored by a lawmaker who’s not a government minister that
seldom becomes law, is having its second reading in the House of
Commons today. It’s been put forward by opposition  Labour Party 
lawmaker John McDonnell.  The proposal would give the House of Commons Treasury
Select Committee powers to reject a candidate for governor.
Lawmakers supporting the bill say the expansion of the central
bank’s powers to oversee the finance industry requires greater
accountability from its officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
