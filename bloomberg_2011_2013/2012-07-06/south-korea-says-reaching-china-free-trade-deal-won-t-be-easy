South Korea  said reaching a free
trade agreement with China “will not be easy” after three days
of talks in  Seoul .  “There were significant differences in opinion,” Deputy
Trade Minister Choi Seok Young told reporters today in Seoul, a
day after he concluded discussions with Chinese counterpart Yu Jianhua. The two sides exchanged “very basic views” on service
and manufacturing criteria and each other’s domestic legal
procedures.  He also confirmed an report today by the Chosun Ilbo
newspaper that South Korea held initial discussions with  Taiwan 
on June 21-22 in Taipei over a bilateral investment treaty.
Full-scale talks probably will be held after October, he said.  “Preparations for an FTA with  China  and consultations with
Taiwan over a possible investment treaty are completely
separate,” Choi said, adding that China did not have any
comment on the treaty with Taiwan.  China is South Korea’s biggest trade partner, amounting to
a total of $221 billion in 2011, a 17 percent increase from the
previous year, according to South Korean trade ministry data.
Taiwan is South Korea’s seventh-largest trade partner and the
South is Taiwan’s fifth largest. Bilateral trade with Taiwan in
2011 was $32.9 billion, according to South Korean trade ministry
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
