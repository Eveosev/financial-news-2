Mauritius’s inflation rate was little
changed at 3.9 percent in June, remaining below the central
bank’s target for a fourth month, the statistics agency said.  Prices increased 0.2 percent in the month because of higher
bread costs, the Port Louis-based Statistics Mauritius said in a
 statement  on its website today. Inflation was 3.8 percent in May
and the average rate for the past 12 months was 5.1 percent, it
said.  “We are still on the safe side,” Renganaden Padayachy, an
economist at the Mauritius Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
said by phone today. “The rate is below the set 4 percent to 6
percent range.”  Slowing inflation has created room for the central bank to
cut its benchmark lending rate to boost the economy as a debt
crisis in  Europe , the Indian Ocean island nation’s main source
of tourists and biggest export destination, curbs demand for
products. Inflation slowed to 3.8 percent in March, the slowest
pace since November 2010.  The statistics agency reduced its forecast for economic
growth this year to 3.5 percent, which would be the smallest
expansion in three years. The Bank of Mauritius cut its key
policy rate in December and March, reducing it to 4.9 percent.  A low inflation rate “gives scope for additional measures
to stimulate growth, curb unemployment, rather than focusing on
price control,” Padayachy said.  The rupee weakened 0.9 percent to 31.05 against the dollar
by 12:15 a.m. in Port Louis, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
