The most-traded bonds of European
companies from  BP Plc (BP/)  to  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  rose to records in the
biggest-ever weekly rally as central banks acted to stimulate
the global economy.  BP’s 1.25 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of 2.994 percent
notes due February 2019 jumped 0.87 cent on the euro, or 0.8
percent, to an all-time high of 105.9 cents, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices at 4:30 p.m. in  London . They rose
2.4 percent on the week, the most since they were issued in
February this year.  The  European Central Bank  cut its main refinancing rate by
a quarter-percentage point to a record-low 0.75 percent
yesterday, followed by a similar measure from  China ’s policy
makers. Though ECB President  Mario Draghi  ruled out other
measures, the cut boosted confidence that was already seen in
bond markets following the decisions of political leaders at
Brussels the week before about how to ease the sovereign crisis.  “There’s a lot of money out there, so there’s good demand
for decent-quality paper,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at
Investec Bank Plc in London. “As long as investors are willing
to take risk at all, people feel happier about putting their
cash into a decent corporate rather than a dodgy sovereign.”  Non-Financials  VW’s 1.25 billion euros of 2.75 percent senior, unsecured
bonds due July 2015 climbed 0.29 cent to a record 104.23 cents
on the euro. That contributed to a 0.6 percent jump in the past
two days after the company completed the purchase of luxury
sports carmaker Porsche SE. The transaction is “credit-
positive for VW,” Moody’s Investors Service said today.  Investors are flocking to corporate bonds as relatively
safe securities that aren’t exposed to the worst of  Europe ’s
sovereign debt woes and still offer a yield at a time when
 German two-year notes  are paying less than zero.  The Markit iBoxx Euro Corporates Non-Financials  index  rose
1.5 percent this week to 97.31, the highest in a month and the
biggest weekly increase since February 2009. The gauge tracks
753 securities issued by investment-grade companies from France
Telecom SA to BP and Siemens AG.  The yield premium on bonds in Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s EMU Corporates, Non-Financial Index shrank 12 basis
points this week to 162 basis points relative to benchmark
German government debt. That’s the biggest weekly spread
tightening since the period ending Jan. 27 when the gap
tightened 15 basis points.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s 1.25 billion euros of senior,
unsecured 3.25 percent notes due January 2016 rose for a fifth
day, climbing 31 cents on the euro to an all-time high of 106.9,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The extra yield
investors demand to hold the bonds fell to 39 basis points more
than the swap rate, approaching the 31 basis-point spread on May
14, the lowest since the notes were sold in January 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
