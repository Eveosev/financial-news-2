WMF Wuerttembergische
Metallwarenfabrik AG (WMF)  received a takeover bid from KKR & Co. that
values the German maker of hotel coffee machines and kitchen
utensils at about 586.2 million euros ($725 million).  KKR plans  to offer  47 euros for each ordinary share and at
least 31.70 euros a preferred share, the New York-based private
equity firm said in a statement today.  WMF, which is being sold by Swiss private-equity firm
CapVis Equity Partners AG, is expanding its coffee-machine
business and pushing into  China . Private-equity firms CVC
Capital Partners Ltd. and Bain Capital LLC were also interested
in the Geislingen, Germany-based company, people familiar with
the negotiations said in April.  “A lot of Germans associate WMF with cutlery but the real
value driver is coffee,” said  Klaus Kraenzle , an analyst at
Silvia Quandt & Cie. “KKR’s strategy will be to expand this
business because it offers high margins.”  WMF shares surged as much as 24 percent to 46.70 euros in
Frankfurt trading, the highest price since 1989. The stock
closed up 23 percent at 46.45 euros.  KKR bought Crystal Capital GmbH’s 52 percent stake in WMF
and Crystal Capital, an investment vehicle of CapVis, committed
to tender 256,489 WMF preferred shares, KKR said.  Fiba, an investment company of Andreas Weissenbacher, said
it won’t sell its WMF shares, Reuters reported. Fiba is WMF’s
second-largest shareholder with a 37 percent stake, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  WMF said on May 15 that first-quarter operating profit
gained 23 percent to 25.3 million euros, boosted by higher
demand for coffee machines. Sales increased 5 percent to 243.6
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
