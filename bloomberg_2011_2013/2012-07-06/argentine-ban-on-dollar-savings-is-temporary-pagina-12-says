Argentina ’s ban on individuals buying
dollars for savings is temporary, central bank President
Mercedes Marco del Pont said in an interview with newspaper
Pagina/12.  The bank “temporarily” prohibited dollar purchases for
savings to prevent an abrupt change in the  exchange rate  and
capital outflows, Marco del Pont told the Buenos Aires-based
daily. The global economic crisis generated uncertainty that led
savers to try to convert peso savings into foreign currencies,
Marco del Pont said, according to the report.  The central bank yesterday issued a list of acceptable
reasons for foreign currency purchases, including travel and
mortgages, that will be granted before Oct. 31. Real estate
transactions will have to be made in pesos starting in November,
Pagina/12 cited Marco del Pont as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
