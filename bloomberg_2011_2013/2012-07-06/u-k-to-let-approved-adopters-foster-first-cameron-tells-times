The U.K. government is planning a law
to make it standard practice for approved adoptive parents to
foster children before adoption to provide a more-stable start
for adoptees, the London-based Times reported, citing an
interview with Prime Minister  David Cameron .  Under the new plan, babies will first be fostered by
approved adopters to “help provide a stable home at a much
earlier stage in a child’s life,” Cameron said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
