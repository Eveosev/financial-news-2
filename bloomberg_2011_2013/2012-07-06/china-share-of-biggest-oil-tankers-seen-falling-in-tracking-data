China ’s share of crude-oil deliveries
by supertankers is poised to fall by 1.5 percentage points,
according to a snapshot of signals from the vessels today and a
week ago.  About 11 percent of the world’s very large crude carriers
are bound for the nation’s ports, compared with 12.6 percent as
of June 29, according to the signals. They were compiled at
about 8 a.m. in London today.  The ships’ combined carrying capacity fell to 14.3 million
deadweight tons from 16.5 million tons. They would be able to
haul about 105.2 million barrels of oil, assuming a conversion
factor of 7.33 million barrels a ton. Each VLCC can transport
about 2 million barrels.  The following table shows the destinations and combined
carrying capacity in deadweight tons of 425 VLCCs, out of a
global fleet of 570, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Average drafts are expressed as a percentage of maximum sailing
depth and are an indication of cargo size. Each country’s
percentage share of total oil shipments is shown for the current
and previous weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
