Workers at the port of Santos will
meet on Jan. 24 to vote on a 24-hour strike, their union said in
a press release today.  The possible strike is set for Feb. 8, said the release
issued by the union, known as Sindaport. It invited all workers
for state-owned Cia. Docas do Estado de  Sao Paulo , or Codesp,
which operates the port, to attend the meeting.  The port workers are considering a strike over issues
involving their retirement plan, among other questions, the
press release said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
