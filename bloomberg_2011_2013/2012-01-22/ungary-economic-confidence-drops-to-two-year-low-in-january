Hungary ’s  economic sentiment  index
dropped to a two-year low in January as the outlook for
businesses and consumers deteriorated.  The index fell to minus 26.8, the lowest level since
November 2009, from minus 24.6 the previous month, the Budapest-
based GKI research institute said today in an e-mailed
statement. The  business confidence  index dropped to minus 16.3
from minus 14.5 in December, while the  consumer confidence  fell
to minus 56.6 from minus 53.3.  Hungary is trying to revive bailout talks with the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund  that broke down last
month over a Hungarian law that they deem to be a threat to
central bank independence. Hungary is willing to change the rule
to quell concern, Premier  Viktor Orban  said Jan. 20.  The forint has rallied 6.3 percent since touching a record
low of 324.24 per euro on Jan. 5. Hungary’s euro-denominated
bonds due July 2014 advanced for a fourth day on Jan. 20,
cutting the yield 51 basis points to 9.741 percent, compared
with 10.987 percent a week ago and 13.034 percent on Jan. 9, the
all-time high for that security.  OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary’s largest lender, has risen 21
percent to 3,816 forint during the past seven trading sessions,
its longest winning streak since the seven days ended April 11,
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
