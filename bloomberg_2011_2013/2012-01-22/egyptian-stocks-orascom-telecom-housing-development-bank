Egyptian Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Housing & Development Bank  (HDBK EY) declined 1.8 percent
to 10.61 Egyptian pounds, the lowest level since December 2006.
The Cairo-based bank is targeting a profit of 296.7 million

lending policy, leading to 7.7 percent growth in its loans
portfolio.  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)   surged 51 percent to
2.62 pounds. The stock soared on speculation the Cairo-based
mobile phone company was undervalued after it split into two and
it resumed trading after a two-month suspension.  Shareholders approved dividing Orascom Telecom to
facilitate a $6.5 billion merger between parent Wind Telecom SpA
and  Russia ’s  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)   Orascom Telecom Media and Technology
