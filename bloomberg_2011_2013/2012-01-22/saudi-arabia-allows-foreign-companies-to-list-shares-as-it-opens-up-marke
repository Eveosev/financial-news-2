Saudi Arabia  will allow overseas
companies to list securities as the Arab world’s  biggest equity
market  seeks to attract investors.  “A foreign issuer whose securities are listed in another
regulated exchange may apply for its securities to be registered
and admitted to listing,” according to amended rules  posted  on
the Capital Market Authority’s website. The regulator may 
approve listings provided “rules applicable in the foreign 
issuer’s jurisdiction of listing are at least equivalent to 
these rules.”  Saudi Arabia’s market regulator is in discussions with
international banks to open the country’s stock exchange to
foreign investors in early 2013, three bankers familiar with the
matter said in October. The kingdom hasn’t set a timeline for
opening its market to foreigners, stock exchange Chief Executive
Officer Abdullah Al-Suweilmy said in December.  Investors outside the  Persian Gulf  can’t directly invest in
Saudi shares. Non-resident foreigners are permitted to trade
through share-swap transactions and exchange-traded funds, with
the market regulator approving the first ETF in March 2010.
The government allowed citizens of neighboring Gulf countries to
buy and sell local shares in 2007.  The benchmark  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  slipped 0.2 percent
to 6,450.58 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The measure
dropped 3.1 percent last year compared with a 20 percent decline
in the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)   To contact the reporter on this story:
