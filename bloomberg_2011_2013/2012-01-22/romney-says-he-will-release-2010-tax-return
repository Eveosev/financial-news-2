Republican presidential candidate
 Mitt Romney  said he will release his 2010  tax return  and
estimate for 2011 taxes on Jan. 24, saying the issue became a
distraction before the South Carolina presidential primary vote.  “We just made a mistake in holding off as long as we did”
in releasing the returns, Romney said today in an interview on
