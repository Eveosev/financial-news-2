State-owned Air Zimbabwe has been
placed under judicial management and may face liquidation after
the airline’s debt rose to $140 million, the state-controlled
 Sunday Mail  said, citing  High Court  documents.  The application to place Air Zimbabwe under judicial
control was made by the airline’s employees, the Harare-based
newspaper said. The High Court appointed Innocent Mavhunga, a
chartered accountant, as the airline’s judicial manager and
barred the Air Zimbabwe board from any involvement with the
company, said the Sunday Mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
