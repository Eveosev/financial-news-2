Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil
company, is interested in making new investments after it sells
its  stake  in  Snam Rete Gas SpA (SRG) , Chief Executive Office Paolo Scaroni told la Repubblica in an interview.  Eni’s debt would fall to about 7 billion euros ($9.1
billion) after the sale, leaving room for investments that may
include exploration, extraction and the commercialization of gas
and oil, the Italian newspaper cited Scaroni as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
