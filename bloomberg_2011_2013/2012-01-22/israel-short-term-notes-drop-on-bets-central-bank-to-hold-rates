Israel ’s short-term government bonds
declined, pushing yields to the highest level in more than five
weeks, on speculation the Bank of Israel will refrain from
lowering interest rates at a policy meeting tomorrow.  The yield on the 3.5 percent notes due August 2014 climbed
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.95 percent at
the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the highest since Dec. 14.
Shorter-term notes are typically more sensitive to rate
fluctuations. The central bank will maintain the benchmark rate
at 2.75 percent, according to 11 of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg
 survey.  The remainder forecast a 25-basis-point reduction.  “Yields on shorter-term bonds are rising as the market is
pricing in that interest rates may hold this month as global
financial markets are calming down,” said Amir Haik, chief
economist at Union  Bank of Israel  Ltd., in Tel Aviv.  Global stocks rose last week after better-than-forecast
U.S. economic data showed the world’s largest economy is
recovering and declining borrowing costs in  Europe  signaled the
debt crisis may be easing.  Greece  and its private creditors said
they made progress during talks in  Athens  on a debt-swap accord
needed to lower the country’s borrowings and clear the way for a
second round of international aid.  The Finance Ministry plans to auction a total of 1.5
billion shekels ($397 million) of debt tomorrow, including 300
million shekels of the benchmark bonds and 250 million shekels
of the notes due August 2014.  Interest Swaps  The central bank may reduce the key rate 27 basis points
over the next 12 months, according to one-year  interest-rate
swaps  on Jan. 20. That compares with 43 basis points of cuts
priced in on Dec. 19.  A poll of 550 investment advisers conducted today showed 78
percent expect the Bank of Israel will hold the  interest rate 
tomorrow, Psagot Investment House Ltd. said. The remainder
predicted a quarter-point reduction, Psagot said.  “Looking ahead to the end of the first quarter, the
central bank is expected to lower rates by between 25 to 50
basis points as the crisis in Europe won’t be resolved so
quickly,” Union Bank’s Haik said.  Economic Growth  The economy may have expanded 3 percent in the fourth
quarter after growing 3.6 percent the previous three months,
Leader Capital Markets Ltd. wrote in a report today.  Growth (ISGSANYY)  was
probably 4.8 percent in 2011, the  Central Bureau of Statistics 
said Dec. 29.  The yield on inflation-linked bonds due June 2013 was
little changed at 0.485 percent. The two-year break-even rate,
the yield difference between the inflation-linked bond and
fixed-rate government bonds of similar maturity, increased two
basis points to 203, implying an average annual inflation rate
of 2.03 percent, the highest since Dec. 15.  Israeli funds raised a net 311 million shekels from
investors in the week ended Jan. 19, Meitav Investment House
Ltd. said today. Corporate-bond funds drew investments of 25
million shekels and government bond funds raised 176 million
shekels, while 11 million shekels were redeemed from stock
funds, according to Meitav.  The  Tel-Bond 40  index of corporate bonds dropped 0.4
percent to 262.42, the lowest since Jan. 9.  The shekel lost 0.1 percent to 3.7811 a dollar on Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
