U.S. House Republicans may tie
approval of  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL pipeline to an
extension of the payroll tax cut backed by President  Barack Obama , Speaker  John Boehner  said.  “All options are on the table,” Boehner said today on the
“Fox News Sunday” program. “The Keystone pipeline is a
bipartisan issue in the Congress.”  The Obama administration last week denied a permit for the
$7 billion pipeline, saying more time is needed to make a
decision on a the project under review since 2008. Boehner
criticized the decision, saying it will keep jobs from being
added in the U.S.  Boehner, who as House speaker will sit behind Obama on Jan.
24 during the president’s State of the Union address to
Congress, said the priorities Obama plans to discuss in that
speech are “pathetic.”  “It sounds to me like the same old policies we’ve seen,
more spending, higher taxes, more regulation,” Boehner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
