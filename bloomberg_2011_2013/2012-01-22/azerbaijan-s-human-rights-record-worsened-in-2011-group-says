Azerbaijan’s human rights record
worsened last year after the former Soviet republic cracked down
on a series of anti-government protests,  Human Rights Watch 
said.  “The government severely restricted freedom of assembly,
did not authorize a single opposition rally in the capital,
Baku, and, swiftly and often violently, dispersed unauthorized
gatherings,” the New York-based group said today in a  statement 
on its website.  More than 50 activists were detained after protests in
March and hundreds more were detained in April, including public
figures and journalists, according to Human Rights Watch. The
protests against the government of President Ilham Aliyev were
staged in an effort to replicate the uprisings that ousted
authoritarian rulers in Egypt and Tunisia.  Government harassment of opposition figures included
sentencing activists to prison terms based on “dubious
charges” and was strongly criticized by the European Union, the
 United States  and other international institutions, Human Rights
Watch said.  The oil-rich nation, which joined the  United Nations
Security Council  on Jan. 1 and will host the Eurovision Song
Contest this year, will have its “poor human rights record
under a glaring spotlight, so the authorities should improve the
country’s record now,” Hugh Williamson,  Europe  and Central Asia
director at Human Rights Watch, said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
