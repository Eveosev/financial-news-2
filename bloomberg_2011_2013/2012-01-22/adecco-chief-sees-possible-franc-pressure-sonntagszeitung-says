Pressure on the Swiss franc to
appreciate may become “immense” if problems in  Europe ’s
economy aren’t resolved in the next two months,  SonntagsZeitung 
reported, citing  Adecco SA (ADEN)  Chief Executive Officer Patrick de Maeseneire.  A lower limit of the Swiss franc to the euro must be
“realistic,” the newspaper quoted Maeseneire as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
