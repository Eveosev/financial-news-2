South Africa ’s Branden Grace beat
countrymen Ernie Els and Retief Goosen in a playoff to win the
Volvo Golf Champions, his second straight victory on the
European Tour.  Grace, 23, who had his maiden tournament success on the
Tour at last week’s Joburg Open, birdied the first extra hole at
The Links at Fancourt in South Africa to take the title.  Grace came through the Qualifying School only last month
and secured his spot in this tournament with last week’s
victory. He claims his biggest prize of 350,000 euros ($452,600)
and will now enter the top 100 of the  Official World Golf
Ranking .  Grace, Els and Goosen finished tied on 12-under-par
following the final round, with Els coming into contention after
a six-under 67 today.  Belgium ’s Nicolas Colsaerts was one shot
back after a bogey on the 18th, with Charl Schwartzel of South
Africa on 10-under.  To contact the reporter on this story:
