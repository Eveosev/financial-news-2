(Corrects to show Global has hold recommendation in last
paragraph of story first published yesterday.)  Mohammad Al-Mojil Group Co. (MMG) , a Saudi
Arabian construction services provider, had its biggest two-day
drop since 2008 on investor speculation the company’s fourth-
quarter loss may widen.  Al-Mojil said Jan. 18 it expects “substantial losses”
that exceed 10 percent of its total assets. The shares fell 6.5
percent to 20.1 riyals at the 3:30 p.m. close in  Riyadh ,
bringing its drop since Jan. 21 to 16 percent, the biggest two-
day decline since November 2008. Al-Mojil had the biggest
percentage drop on  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) , which
slipped 0.2 percent.  If the company projection materializes, “we expect the
full-year loss to be higher than that of 2010 at 261 million
riyals,” said Hettish Karmani, a Kuwait-based analyst at  Global
Investment House KSCC. (GLOBAL)   Al-Mojil posted a 179 million-riyal ($48 million) loss in
2010 after a profit of 40 million riyals the year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 2011 loss is “due to additional costs of materials,
equipment and manpower of some of the ongoing projects in excess
of the approved budgets,” the Dammam, Saudi Arabia-based
company said after the close of trading on Jan. 18.  Al-Mojil said it hired a consultant to review unprofitable
projects. The company will also delay publishing its quarterly
results, which were scheduled for this week, according to
 Bloomberg data .  Al-Mojil, Saudi Arabia’s second-biggest company on the
 Tadawul All Share Building & Construction Index  by market value,
has dropped 17 percent so far this year after a 29 percent surge
in 2011. One analyst recommends investors buy Al-Mojil, while
three, including Karmani, have a “hold” rating, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
