Newt Gingrich , the winner of the
South Carolina Republican presidential primary, thanked
supporters “who decided to be with us in changing  Washington .”  The former speaker’s victory came after a late surge toward
his candidacy after two strong debate performances and Texas
Governor Rick Perry’s decision to quit the race and endorse
Gingrich.  “The biggest thing I take from the campaign in South
Carolina is it is very humbling and very sobering to have so
many people who so deeply want their country to get back on
track,” he said.  As the race moves to Florida and its Jan. 31 contest,
Gingrich’s victory means that three of the four remaining
candidates have each won a primary.  Former Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum  won the Jan. 3
Iowa caucuses. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the
Jan. 10 New Hampshire primary.  After complimenting his competitors, Gingrich turned his
attention to their shared target: President  Barack Obama .  “If Barack Obama can get re-elected after this disaster,
just think how radical he would be in a second term,” said Gingrich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
