Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  and  Irish
Life & Permanent Plc  are in advanced talks with the government
and its bailout partners to transfer loss-making home loans that
are priced to track the main European Central Bank rate, the
 Sunday Business Post  said, citing unnamed industry sources.  The two state-owned lenders may put the loans into off-
balance sheet vehicles or transfer them to nationalized lender
Irish Bank Resolution Corp., formerly Anglo Irish Bank Corp.,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
