Iraq  called on Turkey and Iran not
to interfere in its sovereignty, following statements from
neighboring countries that Iraq said reflected attempts to
meddle in its internal affairs.  “Iraq was not and will not be a subordinate to anyone,”
the country’s foreign ministry said in a statement posted on its
website. “We call upon neighboring brethren Turkey, Iran and
some other Arab countries to respect Iraq’s sovereignty and
independence.”  Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  warned last
month of a civil war if the Shiite-led Iraqi government
continued to marginalize other factions and sects, in a
reference to the Sunnis. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki
later criticized the comments, saying his government didn’t
expect  Turkey  to interfere this way.  “We reject all the harmful statements against Iraq’s
unity, safety and sovereignty, and its democratic federal
system,” the foreign ministry said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
