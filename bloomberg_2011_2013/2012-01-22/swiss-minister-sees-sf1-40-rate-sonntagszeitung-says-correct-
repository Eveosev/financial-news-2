(Corrects currency in headline.)  Swiss Economy Minister Johann
Schneider-Ammann expects the Swiss franc’s exchange rate against
the euro to weaken to 1.40 over the medium term with the return
of “purchasing parity,”  SonntagsZeitung  reported.  Schneider-Ammann’s “minimum expectation” is that the
 Swiss National Bank  maintains the lower limit of 1.20, the
newspaper quoted the minister as saying.  The current strength of the franc is linked to downgrades
by ratings companies and “has nothing to do” with the
resignation of SNB chief Philipp Hildebrand, he said in the
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
