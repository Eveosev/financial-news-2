Hines Real Estate Holdings LP and
 Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  are vying to buy Irish real-estate company
Treasury Holdings’ 900 million euros of outstanding loans from
Ireland’s  National Asset Management Agency , the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  “A standstill agreement” on NAMA’s demands for Treasury
Holdings to repay loans “is due to expire this week,” Ray
Gordon, a NAMA spokesman, told Bloomberg News today. “NAMA is
evaluating proposals from two parties.” He declined to comment
further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
