Ireland’s government may scrap a
plan to sell a stake in country’s largest state-owned utility
Electricity Supply Board, the  Sunday Business Post  reported
without saying where it obtained the information.  The government will discuss proposals this week to test
market appetite for sales of Bord Gais, the state-owned gas
company, and forestry company Coillte Teoranta, which could
raise a total of more than 2 billion euros, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
