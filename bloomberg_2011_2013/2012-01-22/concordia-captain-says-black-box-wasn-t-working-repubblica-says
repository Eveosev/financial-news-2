The black box system of the Costa
Concordia, the cruise liner that ran aground off the coast of
 Italy  on Jan. 13, wasn’t working, the newspaper la Repubblica
reported, citing the testimony of Captain Francesco Schettino.  Schettino told prosecutors the back-up system of the voice
data recorder, or black box, had been broken for 15 days and
while they had asked, it hadn’t been fixed, according to the
Italian newspaper.  That may have compromised the integrity of the registration
of events, the newspaper cited him saying.  Carnival Corp (CCL) ’s Costa Crociere SpA unit asked for the
“salute” on Jan. 13 that led the cruise liner to sail close to
the small island of Giglio where it struck rocks, la Repubblica
cited Schettino as saying.  Schettino’s lawyer didn’t respond to a phone call by
Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
