U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe spoke by
telephone yesterday evening about  France ’s threatened early
withdrawal from Afghanistan, the French foreign ministry said in
an e-mailed statement.  President  Nicolas Sarkozy  suspended operations with the
Afghan army and said France may withdraw its troops from the
country after an Afghan soldier killed four of its military
personnel, the second time in a month an Afghan soldier has
killed French troops.  Defense Minister Gerard Longuet and Admiral Edouard
Guillard, chief of staff, are in Afghanistan to assess the
situation, and Sarkozy said in a speech Jan. 20 that he’ll
decide on the future of France’s 3,900 troops in the country
based on their report. Sarkozy meets Afghan President Hamid Karzai Jan. 27 in Paris.  “The President of the Republic will draw all the
consequences of the attack against our forces,” the foreign
ministry said in the statement. Clinton offered her condolences
for the deaths, which bring to 82 the number of French military
personnel killed in  Afghanistan .  Longuet told reporters in Afghanistan that the Afghan
soldier who killed the French troops was a Taliban infiltrator.  Karzai today told Longuet that the the shooting “was an
isolated case by an individual who is in custody and being
investigated,” according to a statement from Karzai’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
