Sudan ’s human rights record
deteriorated in 2011 with the eruption of new armed conflicts
and crackdowns on students, rights advocates and the media,
Human Rights Watch said.  “Throughout the year, the government restricted basic
freedoms of expression and assembly by breaking up public
protests, arresting perceived opponents of the government, and
censoring newspapers,” the New York-based group said today in a
statement posted on its website.  Fighting in the border states of Blue Nile and Southern
Kordofan has intensified since South Sudan seceded on July 9,
assuming control of three-quarters of the former state’s oil
production of 490,000 barrels a day. In Darfur, government
forces attacked displaced populations and villages, particularly
those inhabited by ethnic Zaghawa,  Human Rights Watch  said.  “Darfur’s long-running war and the proliferation of
conflicts in Sudan this year shows what happens when there is no
accountability,”  Daniel Bekele , the group’s Africa director,
was cited as saying in the report. “Sudan’s conflicts will
continue unless the government brings abusers to justice and
shows respect for human rights.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
