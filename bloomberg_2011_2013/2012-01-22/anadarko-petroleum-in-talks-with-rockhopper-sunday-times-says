Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  is
“considering a move” on  Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH) , the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  Anadarko executives last week met managers of the U.K.
company that discovered oil near the Falkland Islands off
Argentina, according to the report.  Rockhopper has hired Bank of America Corp. to find a
partner to share the development costs of the Sea Lion
reservoir, the Sunday Times said. The search may lead to a
takeover, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified bankers.  An external spokesman in London for Rockhopper declined to
comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
