The  Boston Red Sox  acquired right-
handed pitcher Clayton Mortensen from the Colorado Rockies in
exchange for shortstop Marco Scutaro, and signed Daniel Bard to
a one-year contract, General Manager  Ben Cherington  said.  With Bard’s signing, Alfredo Aceves,  Andrew Bailey  and
David Ortiz are Boston’s only remaining unsigned arbitration-
eligible players.  Mortensen, 26, had a 3.86 earned run average and was 2-4
over 16 appearances during two stints with the Rockies last year.
During his career, he is 4-8 with a 5.12 ERA and 50 strikeouts
in 24 games with the St. Louis Cardinals, Oakland Athletics and
Rockies.  Scutaro, 36, hit .299 with seven home runs, 54 runs batted
in and 38 walks for the  Red Sox  last season. The right-handed
batter has a career .270 average with 68 home runs and 404 RBIs
in 1,103 Major League Baseball games with the  New York Mets ,
Athletics, Toronto Blue Jays and Red Sox.  Right-handed pitcher Bard, 26, agreed to a one-year, non-
guaranteed contract for the next season and avoided salary
arbitration.  The team didn’t disclose terms of the contract.  Bard set a Red Sox record and tied for the American League
lead with 34 holds last season, while posting a 3.33 ERA and a
2-9 record. He tied for fifth in the American League with 55
scoreless outings and set an all-time club record with a 25-game
consecutive scoreless streak from May 27-July 31.  Bard is 5-13 with a 2.88 ERA and 213 strikeouts in 192
career Major League outings with the Red Sox, all in relief,
from 2009-11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
