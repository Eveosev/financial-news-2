Manchester United  wants to sign
Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric at the end of the season, with
the Premier League soccer champion set to bid 50 million pounds
($78 million) for the Croatian, the Mail on Sunday  reported .  Modric is United’s top target as it seeks a long-term
replacement for  Paul Scholes , the newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information.  United tried to sign Inter Milan’s Wesley Sneijder in the
summer, but his 250,000 pounds a week wages would have broken
the club’s salary structure, the Mail said. Modric would likely
double his 60,000 pounds a week wages, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
