Swatch Group AG (UHR)  Chief Executive
Officer Nick Hayek said the watchmaker may grow faster than the
expected Swiss watch export growth of 5 percent to 10 percent in
2012,  NZZ am Sonntag  reported.  Exports of Swiss watches in 2011 may have reached between
19 billion Swiss francs ($20.3 billion) and 20 billion Swiss
francs, the newspaper quoted Hayek as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
