Australia ’s economy will accelerate
this year as resource investment drives growth, lifting  core
inflation  to the middle of the central bank’s 2 percent to 3
percent target range, Deloitte Access Economics said.  Gross domestic product will expand 3.6 percent in 2012 from
an estimated 2 percent growth last year, the Canberra-based
research company said in a report released today. Underlying
inflation, which excludes the most volatile components, is
estimated at 2.5 percent this year compared with 1.8 percent
last year, Access said.  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens cut
 interest rates  in November and December -- the first consecutive
reductions since 2009 -- as Europe’s debt crisis weakens
prospects for global growth. Investors are pricing in a 79
percent chance he will lower borrowing costs by a quarter
percentage point to 4 percent at the next meeting on Feb. 7, a
Credit Suisse Group AG Index showed Jan. 20.  “Although wage growth is expected to remain restrained
outside of resources, that may not provide the degree of
protection the  Reserve Bank  would like to see for Australian
inflation,” according to the report. “Until Europe does or
doesn’t ‘blow,’ the Reserve may be best to sit on its hands. It
can always move fast if it needs to.”  Australia’s currency has dropped about 6 percent since it
reached $1.1081 on July 27, the highest level since it was
freely floated in 1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
