Japanese  stock   futures  were little

weakening the euro, which will likely push down stock prices,”

Inc. “Improving U.S. economic data is easing investors’ risk
aversion  which will likely limit the pressure to sell stocks.”  U.S. Futures  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index added 0.1 percent in New York on Jan.
20, erasing a loss in the final minutes of trading, as banks
