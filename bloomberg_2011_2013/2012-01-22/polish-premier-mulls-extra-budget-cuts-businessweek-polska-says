Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is
considering more radical budget cuts than officially planned to
shore up the country’s credibility on international markets, the
Polish edition of Bloomberg Businessweek said.  Tusk is the first Polish prime minister since the collapse
of communism to win a second consecutive term. He has already
fulfilled a pledge made to raise employers’ disability
contributions, and plans to cut tax incentives and introduce a
tax on metals extraction to narrow the budget gap to within the
European Union’s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product
this year.  When the government has enacted the majority of the laws
outlined by Tusk following the October general election, he will
list a new series of initiatives to ensure that budget cuts are
sufficient to get the deficit down, Businessweek said, without
saying where it got the information.  The measures may include cutting the 19 percent corporate
tax, introducing a flat rate personal income tax and value-added
tax, introducing toll fees for road usage, and eliminating some
local authorities by redrawing constituency lines, Businessweek
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
