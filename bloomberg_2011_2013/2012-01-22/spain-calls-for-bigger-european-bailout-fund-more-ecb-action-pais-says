The European Stability Mechanism
should probably have greater capacity than its 500 billion
euros, and the  European Central Bank  “can do much more” to
support bond markets,  Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel
Garcia-Margallo was quoted as saying in El Pais today.  The euro region needs to move towards a “federal Europe”
and “the mutualization of debt,” he was quoted as saying by
the newspaper. Stronger European nations should stimulate
internal demand while the  European Investment Bank  could
increase spending to bolster the economy, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
