An Iranian passenger boat ran out of
fuel and sank in the  Persian Gulf  off the country’s southern
coast leaving at least 16 people dead, state-media reported.  The boat was transporting 20 passengers and two crew
members from Iran’s Hormuz Island to the mainland port city of
 Bandar Abbas  when it sank, the state-run  Press TV  news channel
said on its website.  Five people have been rescued and efforts are continuing to
find a missing passenger, the official  Islamic Republic News
Agency  reported.  The pier on Hormuz Island was closed due to poor weather
and the boat’s trip was illegal, Press TV said. Hormuz Island is
located some 18 kilometers (11 miles) south of Bandar Abbas, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
