A Sunni cleric was assassinated in
 Iran ’s southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, state-run
 Press TV  reported, without citing anyone.  Molavi Mostafa Jangi Zehi, who was the Friday prayers
leader of the southeastern town of Rask, was killed late on Jan.
20 while on the road, the news channel said in a report
published on its website yesterday. The report gave no details
of the attack and said no group has claimed responsibility for
the assassination.  Jangi Zehi advocated unity between Sunni and Shia Muslims,
Press TV said. The Sistan-Baluchistan province borders
Afghanistan and  Pakistan  to the east and is one of the country’s
poorest. The Sunni-dominated province in the mostly Shiite
Muslim nation has experienced political unrest and several
attacks on military officials in recent years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
