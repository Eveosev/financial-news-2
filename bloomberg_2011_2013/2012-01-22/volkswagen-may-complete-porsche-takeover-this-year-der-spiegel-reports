Volkswagen AG (VOW)  may this year complete
the purchase of the 50.1 percent of Porsche SE’s automotive
business that it does not already own for 3.9 billion euros,
 Der Spiegel  said, citing unidentified VW managers.  VW will get around having to pay more than 1 billion euros
in taxes if completing the purchase before 2014 by setting up a
holding company to temporarily take control of the stake,
Spiegel reported. Volkswagen will also take steps to ensure
Porsche’s independence within the VW group to get over
resistance from Porsche labor leaders, the magazine said.  VW already owns 49.9 percent of Porsche’s automotive unit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
