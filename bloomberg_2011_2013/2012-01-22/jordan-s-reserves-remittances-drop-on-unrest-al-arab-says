Jordan’s foreign currency reserves
and remittances from expatriates declined last year due to
regional unrest, Al Arab Al Yawm reported.  Foreign currency reserves declined 12.3 percent to $10.7
billion in 2011 from $12.2 billion the previous year, the
newspaper reported, citing official figures.  Remittances dropped 5.2 percent to 2.402 billion dinars
($3.4 billion) in 2011 from 2.585 billion dinars. The
remittances, mostly from workers residing in Gulf states,
support the kingdom’s economy, particularly the real estate
industry, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
