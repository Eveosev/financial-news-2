Mitt Romney finished second in the
 South Carolina  primary after a late surge by  Newt Gingrich , the
former U.S. House speaker who won, the  Associated Press 
projected.  “This race is getting to be even more interesting,”
Romney told supporters.  “We’ve still got a long way to go and
a lot of work to do.”  With Gingrich’s victory, three of the four remaining
candidates in the contest have each won a primary.  Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum yesterday was
officially declared the winner of the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses.
Romney won the Jan. 10 New Hampshire primary. U.S.
Representative Ron Paul of Texas has yet to win a contest.  After congratulating Gingrich, Romney took a swipe at the
speaker’s criticism of the former Massachusetts governor’s work
in private equity. “If Republican leaders want to join this
president and demonize” success, then they won’t “be fit” to
win the party’s nomination, Romney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
