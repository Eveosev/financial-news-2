Matalan Ltd. (MTN) , a U.K. clothing
retailer, asked for a relaxation of covenants on its debt,  the
Sunday Times  reported, citing a conference call with the
company’s bondholders.  Matalan’s annual profit is likely to be between 90 million
pounds ($140 million) and 95 million pounds, less than the
company forecast, the newspaper said, citing the call. No one
from Matalan was available to comment when called by Bloomberg
News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
