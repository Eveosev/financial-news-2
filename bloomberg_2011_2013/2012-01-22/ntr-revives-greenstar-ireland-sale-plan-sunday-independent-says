NTR Plc , the closely held Irish
renewable energy and waste management company, revived plans to
sell its Greenstar Ireland waste unit for as much as 150 million
euros ($194 million), the  Sunday Independent  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Dublin-based NTR scrapped plans to sell the business last
year, the newspaper said. NTR said itâ€™s aware of speculation
relating to Greenstar Ireland and that the unit is subject to an
ongoing review process, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
