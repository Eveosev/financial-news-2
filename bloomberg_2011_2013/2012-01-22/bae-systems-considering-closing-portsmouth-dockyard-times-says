BAE Systems Plc (BA/@LN)  is considering
closing the Portsmouth dockyard after a review of its
shipbuilding operations, the Sunday Times said, citing
unidentified industry officials.  A closure of the dockyard may lead to as many as 3,000 job
losses, the newspaper reported.  “As part of our business planning activity, we are
reviewing how best to retain the capability to deliver and
support complex warships in the U.K. in the future,” BAE said
in a statement cited by the newspaper. “This work is ongoing
and we will keep our employees and trade union representatives
fully informed, as it progresses.”  A telephone message left with the company seeking a comment
was not immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
