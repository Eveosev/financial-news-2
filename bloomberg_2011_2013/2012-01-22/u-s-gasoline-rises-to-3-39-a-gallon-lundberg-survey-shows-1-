The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 3.48 cents to $3.3944 a
gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The price increase covers the two-week period ended Jan. 20
and is based on the Camarillo, California-based company’s survey
of about 2,500 stations. The average is 28 cents higher than a
year earlier, when it was $3.1111 a gallon.  “The reduced margins on gasoline for retailers has
suggested upward pressure on the price as they try to make a bit
more per gallon,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg
Survey, said yesterday in a telephone interview. “It would take
crude oil staying as low as it is to prevent any retail price
increase.”  Gasoline for February delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 3.28 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.7844 a gallon in
the two weeks ended Jan. 20.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  jumped 3.72 million barrels to
227.5 million in the week ended Jan. 13, according to the Energy
Department. Inventories are the highest in 10 months after
rising 11 percent since Nov. 4.  Deliveries Sink  Deliveries  to wholesalers are at a 10-year low, sinking 2.2
percent from the prior week to 8 million barrels a day. Over the
past four weeks, consumption was 6.1 percent below a year
earlier, while total fuel supplied in the U.S. was down 7.2
percent.  Demand at the pump in the week ended Jan. 13 fell below
year-earlier levels for the 20th consecutive time, declining 3.5
percent from 2011, according to  MasterCard (MA)  Inc.’s SpendingPulse
report on Jan. 18. During the previous four weeks, consumption
was 3 percent below a year earlier, the 43rd straight fall in
that measure.  The front-month crude oil contract fell $3.10, or 3.1
percent, in the two weeks ended Jan. 20 to settle at $98.46.  Crude prices may rise this week on speculation that an
economic recovery in the U.S., the world’s top oil consumer,
will boost demand, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Eighteen of 40 analysts, or 45 percent, forecast oil will
advance through Jan. 27. Fifteen respondents, or 38 percent,
predicted a decline and seven estimated there will be little
change. Last week, 50 percent of analysts projected a drop.  Crude Supplies Fell  Crude oil  supplies  fell 3.44 million barrels to 331.2
million in the seven days through Jan. 13, according to
department data.  Inventories (DOESCROK)  at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil, fell 2.9
percent to 28.3 million, the lowest level since November 2009.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline averaged $3.66 a gallon in
the latest survey, Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail
stations averaged $3.71 a gallon, which was the highest price in
the lower 48 U.S. states among the cities priced as part of the
Lundberg Survey.  The lowest price among the cities surveyed was in  Salt Lake
City , where a gallon averaged $2.94, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
