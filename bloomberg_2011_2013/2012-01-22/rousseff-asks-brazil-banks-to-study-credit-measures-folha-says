Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
asked state-run banks to study measures to expand credit so as
to maintain economic growth,  Folha de S.Paulo ’s newswire
reported without saying where it obtained the information.  Rousseff asked Banco do Brasil SA and Caixa Economica
Federal to examine ways to increase credit for production,
 consumer spending , and to support exporters, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper’s online service said.  The president’s economic team targets growth of 4 percent
to 5 percent this year, and the base for that will be internal
demand financed by credit, the service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
