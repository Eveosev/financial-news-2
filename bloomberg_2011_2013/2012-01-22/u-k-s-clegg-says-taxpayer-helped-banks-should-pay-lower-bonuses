U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  said banks that received taxpayer aid after the financial
crisis, such as the  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , should pay
lower bonuses and use the money to improve their balance sheets.  “If it was left up to me, we wouldn’t have any bonuses,
particularly in the state-owned banks while they’re still being
repaired” after the financial crisis, Clegg said in a
television interview on the  BBC ’s “The Andrew Marr Show”
today. “What we want to see: lower bonuses, more money being
put into repairing the balance sheet and a lower bonus pool.”  With the bank bonus season approaching and the prospect of
large sums being paid to financiers at a time when many voters
are enduring pay freezes, the three main U.K. political parties
are trying to offer ways that capitalism can be made to function
better. RBS may pay investment bankers a total of about 2.5
billion pounds ($3.9 billion) including pay, perks and an
estimated 500 million pounds in bonuses, the Sunday Times
reported today without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
