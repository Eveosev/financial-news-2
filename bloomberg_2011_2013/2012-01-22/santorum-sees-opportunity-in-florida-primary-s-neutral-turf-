Republican presidential candidate
 Rick Santorum  of Pennsylvania said he may fare better against
rival  Newt Gingrich  on  Florida ’s “neutral turf” than in
“Newt’s backyard” of  South Carolina .  “Leading into Florida yesterday we were sitting in second
place in Florida,” Santorum said today in an interview with
CNN’s “State of the Union.”  While “Florida is a tough state for everybody,” it
represents an opportunity for Santorum because he’s a “solid
conservative,” the former Pennsylvania senator said.  Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the U.S. House of
Representatives, won 40 percent of the vote in South Carolina’s
Republican presidential primary yesterday. Mitt Romney, a former
Massachusetts governor, ran second with 28 percent, with 99
percent of the vote counted. Santorum had 17 percent, followed
by U.S. Representative Ron Paul of  Texas  with 13 percent. The
next primary will be held in Florida on Jan. 31.  “I would disagree with Newt that he is the conservative
standard bearer,” said Santorum. “He is a very high risk
candidate.”  In a separate interview on ABC’s ‘This Week,’ Santorum said
that he would allay the concerns of candidates who aren’t
satisfied with Romney or Gingrich.  “A lot of conservatives are very concerned about the
choice between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, because in their
opinion and in mine, that’s not a choice between a conservative
and a moderate,” Santorum said. “It’s a choice between a
moderate and an erratic conservative, someone who on a lot of
the major issues has been just wrong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
