Carnival Corp. (CCL) ’s Costa Crociere SpA
said its Concordia ship’s “touristic navigation” was planned
on its Jan. 13 cruise, and according to international rules, it
was up to the captain to ensure the safety of the route.  Costa’s rules allow navigation five miles from the coast,
the Genoa, Italy-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Costa said it “always” respects rules.  The company was responding to a report in newspapers
including la Repubblica today that Captain Francesco Schettino
told prosecutors the company asked for the “salute” on Jan. 13
that led the cruise liner to sail close to the small island of
Giglio where it struck rocks.  Schettino’s lawyer didn’t respond to a phone call by
Bloomberg News seeking comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
