Gerry Adams , president of Irish
opposition party  Sinn Fein , has received legal advice that the
government is constitutionally obliged to hold a vote on a
proposed European fiscal pact.  Based on the text of an initial draft, Sinn Fein was
advised “that there’s a constitutional imperative for the
government to go to a referendum,” Adams said in an interview
aired by Dublin-based  RTE Radio  today. “What we have to see is
the final draft. We will take legal advice but we’ll oppose this
treaty.”  Adams, 63, elected a member of parliament in the  Republic
of Ireland  for the first time last year, said he hadn’t
considered a retirement date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
