Gulf Capital, an Abu Dhabi-based
private-equity company, bought an 82.7 percent stake in power
generation services company Sakr Energy Solutions FZCO and said
it expects to complete three more buyouts this year.  Gulf Capital acquired the stake without using debt and at
40 percent below the average valuation of global peers, Chief
Executive Officer Karim El Solh said in a telephone interview
today. The stake was acquired from Sakr Holding, which along
with Dubai-based Sakr Energy’s current management, set up the
company in July 2007 after the separation of the Middle Eastern
assets of GE Energy Rentals, Gulf Capital said in a statement.  “This is a young and growing company in a fast-growing
sector” and the deal adheres to Gulf Capital’s strategy of
investing in defensive and non-cyclical businesses, El Solh
said. He declined to provide a value for the acquisition.  Gulf Capital, set up in 2006, is using funds from its $533
million GC Equity Fund II for investments. More than half of the
funds have been used so far and the company expects to have
spent three quarters by year-end as it plans another two to
three buyout deals, El Solh said. It also expects to sell one to
two investments this year, he said.  Sakr Energy, which operates in the  United Arab Emirates ,
 Saudi Arabia , Qatar, Yemen, Oman and Tanzania, plans to raise
$30 million to $50 million from loans to expand, El Solh said.
The company provides deployment of turnkey power generation
solutions along with rental equipment, and plans to expand in
other countries in  Africa  and  Southeast Asia , he said.  The global deficit in power generation increased to 150,000
megawatts in 2010 from 50,000 megawatts in 2004 and is expected
to rise to 600,000 megawatts by 2015, according to the Gulf
Capital statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
