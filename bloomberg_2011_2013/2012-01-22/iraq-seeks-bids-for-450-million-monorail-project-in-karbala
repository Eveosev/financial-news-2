Iraq ’s southern Karbala province
invited bids for a $450 million monorail project, the head of
the region’s investment agency said.  The 18 kilometer (11 mile) rail line would link Karbala, a
city of pilgrimage for Shiite Muslims, with the provinces of
Baghdad and Babel, Taief Ali said in a telephone interview from
Karbala today. The network will have 18 stations, the last one
at about 200 meters from the Imam Hussein and Imam Abbas shrines
in Karbala, he said.  Lebanese, Iranian and Gulf companies have expressed
interest in the project, he said. He did not disclose their
names.  The Karbala Investment Commission also plans to seek bids
later this year for a new airport capable of carrying 5 million
passengers a year and a $167 million real-estate project to
construct 2,772 residential apartments in the province, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
