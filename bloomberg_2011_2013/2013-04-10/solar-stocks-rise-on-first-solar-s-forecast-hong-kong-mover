Asian solar companies rose, led by
 Solargiga Energy Holdings Ltd. (757)  and  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings
Ltd. (3800) , after First Solar Inc.’s earnings forecast beats
expectations.  Solargiga rose 6 percent to HK$0.375 at 11:54 a.m. in Hong
Kong after earlier climbing as much as 13 percent, the most
intraday since Jan. 9. GCL-Poly, the biggest maker of
polysilicon used in solar panels, rose as much as 10 percent.
 Motech Industries Inc. (6244) , Taiwan’s biggest solar-cell producer,
and Japan’s  Tokuyama Corp. (4043)  gained 3 percent.  First Solar, the world’s largest thin-film solar
manufacturer by output, surged 46 percent yesterday, the most on
record, after forecasting sales of $3.8 billion to $4 billion
this year. Earnings will be $4 to $4.50 a share, exceeding the
$3.57 average of 23 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors seem to have underestimated some solar companies’
earnings, Lian Rui, a Beijing-based analyst at research company
NPD Solarbuzz, said by phone today. “Solar-component prices may
rise this year.”  A portion of  First Solar (FSLR) ’s sales this year will come from
the 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight solar farm the company is
building in Southern California, according to a statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
