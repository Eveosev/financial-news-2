KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) ,  Poland ’s sole
copper and silver producer, soared the most in almost five
months as  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  recommended buying the stock on
expectations the company will pay half its profit as a  dividend .  The  shares  advanced 3.5 percent, the biggest gain since
Nov. 19, to close at 162.7 zloty in Warsaw. The stock has
declined 14 percent  this year , compared with a 8.2 percent fall
in Warsaw’s WIG20 Index. UniCredit upgraded KGHM from hold and
cut its price estimate 10 percent to 185 zloty.  “We assume KGHM will pay a dividend of 12.2 zloty per
share,” Marcin Gatarz, an analyst at UniCredit in Warsaw, said
in a research note today. This “translates into a dividend
yield of 7.8 percent and should be supportive of the share
price.”  KGHM, in which Poland holds a 32 percent  stake , should pay
out at least 30 percent of its 4.87 billion-zloty ($1.55
billion) profit, Parkiet reported on Feb. 18, citing Treasury
Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski. The budget gap reached about 25
billion zloty in the first quarter, or 70 percent of the
government’s full-year plan after the economic slowdown cut  tax
revenue , Deputy Finance Minister Hanna Majszczyk said April 4.  UniCredit estimates the government budget “appears to be
short of at least 10 billion zloty in revenue” this year, which
“should result in a strong appetite for dividends” from state-
controlled companies.  Deutsche Bank AG, which maintained its buy recommendation
in a note yesterday, expects KGHM to return 60 percent of last
year’s profit to shareholders, or 14.8 zloty a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
