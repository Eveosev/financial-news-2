Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher  said that both the ultimate benefits
and costs of the central bank’s asset purchases are unclear.  “Companies are starting to use the copious cheap money
they have access to for investing in capital projects and
employing increasing amounts of  workers ,” Fisher said in the
text of prepared remarks given today in El Paso, Texas. “But it
is not yet clear that we will achieve a justifiable bang for the
trillions of bucks the Fed has flooded the economy with.”  Several Fed officials said the central bank should begin
slowing the pace of its  asset purchasing program  later this year
and halt it entirely by year’s end, according to  minutes  of the
March 19-20 Federal Open Market Committee meeting released
today. The Fed at that gathering affirmed its plan to keep
buying $85 billion per month in mortgage bonds and Treasuries.  “The  Federal Reserve  has provided plenty of, if not too
much, high-octane fuel in the form of cheap and abundant money
to propel the economy forward,” Fisher said at the  University
of Texas  at El Paso.  Since U.S. central bankers met last month, a Labor
Department report has shown that job growth sputtered to 88,000
in March from 268,000 in February. The Fed has said it will keep
the quantitative easing program in place until the labor market
substantially improves.  Fisher, who doesn’t vote on the FOMC this year, has been
among the most vocal critics of additional monetary easing
within the Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
