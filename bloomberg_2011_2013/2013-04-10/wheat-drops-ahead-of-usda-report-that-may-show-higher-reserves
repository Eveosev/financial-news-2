Wheat futures fell the most in more
than a week after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said global
inventories will be bigger than forecast last month. Soybeans
also declined.  World  stockpiles  of wheat before this year’s Northern
Hemisphere harvest will total 182.26 million metric tons, more
than the 178.23 million forecast in March, the USDA said.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected 178.82 million. Prices
have plunged into a  bear market , down 26 percent from last
year’s closing peak, on signs that global demand is slowing and
that farmers will boost output in the next year.  “The wheat global balance sheet was outright bearish with
the upward revision to old-crop stocks,”  Terry Reilly , a senior
commodity analyst for Futures International LLC in  Chicago , said
in an e-mailed report.  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 1.5 percent to settle
at $7.03 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since April 1. The
price is down 9.6 percent this year.  China’s wheat stockpiles may total 58.75 million tons, up
5.4 percent from last month’s estimate, the USDA said.
Inventories held by North African countries including  Egypt , the
biggest importer, will be 9 percent higher than forecast at
10.78 million tons, the agency said. The estimate for European
Union stockpiles was raised 5.5 percent to 10.04 million tons.  Reserves in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter, will
total 731 million bushels, up from 716 million seen in March and
730 million forecast by analysts.  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$13.9275 a bushel, the first decline in three days. The most-
active contract is down 1.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
