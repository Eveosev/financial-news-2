India , the largest palm oil
importer, is set to consider raising the minimum prices of
soybeans and peanuts by as much as 14 percent to boost output
and pare reliance on imports, two government officials said.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, which
advises the government on crop prices, recommended 2,500 rupees
($45.85) per 100 kilograms (220 pounds) for black soybeans and
2,560 rupees for yellow soybeans for the year beginning July 1,
said the officials, who asked not to be identified citing
policy. Farmers get 2,200 rupees and 2,240 rupees respectively
now. The minimum price of peanuts should be increased 8 percent
to 4,000 rupees per 100 kilograms, it said.  The  Agriculture Ministry  may seek cabinet approval next
month to increase prices after consulting state governments and
other ministries, the officials said. The panel recommended that
prices of common paddy be raised to 1,310 rupees per 100
kilograms from 1,250 rupees, corn to 1,310 rupees from 1,175
rupees and long-staple cotton to 4,000 rupees from 3,900 rupees,
the officials said.  Manoj Pandey, a spokesman for the agriculture ministry in
 New Delhi , declined to comment when contacted today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
