Canadian  stocks  rose for a third
day, the longest winning streak in a month, as energy producers
and banks advanced amid higher-than-forecast Chinese imports.  Royal Bank of Canada , the nation’s largest lender, and Bank
of Nova Scotia added more than 1.8 percent.  Arc Resources (ARX)  Ltd.
and Husky Energy Inc. gained at least 2.7 percent as natural gas
surged and oil erased an earlier loss. Barrick Gold Corp., the
world’s largest producer of the metal, plunged to a four-year
low after a report that a Chilean court ordered work halted at
the company’s Pascua Lama mine.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  climbed 50.86
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,534.91 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The

its loss for the year. Trading volume was in line with the 30-

for the commodity side,” said Irwin Michael, portfolio manager
with ABC Funds in Toronto. His firm oversees about C$800 million
($788 million). “With the banks, people are coming to terms
with the fact the Canadian housing market is not going to
crash.”  Imports to  China ,  Canada ’s second-largest trading partner
behind the U.S., rose by an above-forecast 14 percent in March,
the nation’s customs administration said today in Beijing.  Data yesterday showed Canadian housing starts unexpectedly
increased for a second month in March and building permits rose
in February, evidence that low borrowing costs are supporting
construction.  Oil, Gas  Oil prices rose 0.5 percent to $94.64, the highest
settlement since April 2, erasing losses of as much as 0.9
percent earlier in the day. The Chinese import data, Japanese
stimulus plans and speculation that corporate earnings will beat
estimates sent U.S. equities to record highs, bolstering
speculation that fuel consumption will climb.  Natural gas futures rose 1.7 percent to settle at $4.085
per million British thermal units, the first gain in three days,
following forecasts for below-normal temperatures through mid-
April in the western U.S. Arc Resources added 3.4 percent to
C$27.48, the highest in more than two years. Husky Energy
advanced 2.7 percent to C$29.92.  Bank shares rallied, with the  S&P/TSX Financials index 
advancing 1.3 percent, the most in eight months.  Royal Bank (RY) 
gained 2 percent to C$61.38. Scotiabank rose 1.8 percent, the
biggest jump in almost 10 months, to C$58.39.  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , based in  Montreal , climbed 0.5 percent to
C$4.09 after announcing it signed a deal to sell as many as 30
of its new CSeries jets to Porter Airlines. The full order would
be worth as much as $2.08 billion based on list prices,
Bombardier said.  Gold Slump  Raw materials producers were the only group among 10 in the
index to decline, falling 2.9 percent today to extend the
S&P/TSX Materials Index’s loss this year to 16 percent.  Gold producers  slumped 4.9 percent as a group, the lowest
close since December 2008. The metal’s price slid the most in
five months, dropping 1.8 percent to settle at $1,558.80 an
ounce.  Barrick tumbled 8.6 percent to C$24.81, the lowest level
since October 2008. Chile’s Radio Cooperativa reported an
appeals court accepted an injunction filed by indigenous
communities against the Pascua-Lama gold project. The company
said in an e-mail it has not been notified by the court and had
no comment.  Rio Alto Mining Ltd. (RIO) , which is developing the La Arena gold
and copper project in  Peru , dropped 2.6 percent to C$4.51 after
suspending operations at the mine late yesterday when a worker
died in an accident while digging a trench. The company has not
