Hungary’s 10-year bond yields fell
for a seventh day to the lowest since September 2005 as the
central bank prepared to release minutes of a meeting where
policy makers cut the benchmark rate to a record low.  Magyar Nemzeti Bank lowered rates to 5 percent in March at
the first meeting chaired by new President Gyorgy Matolcsy,
dropping a tradition of press conferences to explain the
decision. Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  will nominate a new deputy
president to the bank today, the MTI news service reported.
Julia Kiraly resigned two days ago saying Matolcsy’s overhaul of
staffing and operations is threatening the bank’s credibility.  “Today’s central bank’s minutes will be watched more
closely than usual as last month’s rate decision wasn’t followed
by a press conference,” analysts at Erste Group Bank AG
including Zoltan Arokszallasi in Budapest said in an e-mailed
note to investors.  The longest streak of advances in the 10-year bonds since
October sent yields down six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 5.78 percent. The forint appreciated 0.2 percent to
296.67 per euro by 10:40 a.m. in Budapest.  Forward-rate agreements used to wager on  interest rates  in
three months fell two basis points to 4.12 percent, within one
basis point of a record low. The FRA contracts traded 75 basis
points below the Budapest Interbank Offered rate, within two
basis points of the biggest spread since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
