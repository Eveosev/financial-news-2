European Union antitrust
regulators have accepted an offer from  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech
Republic’s largest power producer, to sell power assets to
resolve a competition probe into whether it hindered rivals.  “The divestiture of significant generation capacity will
allow a new player to enter the Czech electricity market and to
compete with the incumbent CEZ,” EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia said in an e-mailed statement. “This will
benefit all electricity customers,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
