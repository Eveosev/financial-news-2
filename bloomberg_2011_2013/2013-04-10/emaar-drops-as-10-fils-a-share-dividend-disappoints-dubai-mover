Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  dropped for
the first time in three days after shareholders approved the
board’s  dividend recommendation , disappointing some investors
who had anticipated a higher payout.  The shares fell 1.8 percent to 5.35 dirhams at the close in
Dubai, trimming this year’s gain to 43 percent. About 16 million
shares were traded, or 83 percent of the three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Emaar has the
highest weighting on  Dubai’s benchmark index, which  retreated
0.4 percent.  Shareholders approved the board’s recommendation of 10 fils
a share yesterday after the market closed. Emaar may report a 4
percent increase in net income this year after an 18 percent
surge in 2012, according to the median estimate of 12 analysts
on Bloomberg.  “This pull-back is expected as investors expected bigger
dividend distribution,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, managing
director of NBAD Securities in  Abu Dhabi . “Also some investors
are concerned about the lack of clarity on where profits this
year will come from.”  Ten analysts have a buy rating on the stock, five say hold
and one recommends selling, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
