Shareholders of  Julius Baer Group
Ltd. (BAER) , Switzerland’s third-largest wealth manager, rejected the
bank’s 2012 remuneration report in a non-binding vote.  In a so-called advisory  vote  at the annual general meeting
in Zurich today, 64 percent of investors rebuffed executive pay
including total compensation of 6.7 million Swiss francs ($7.2
million) for Chief Executive Officer  Boris Collardi .  “The board of directors will take the appropriate measures
to work toward a positive vote at the next AGM,” Julius Baer
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Collardi’s 2012 pay includes a so-called integration award
of 800,000 francs after the firm acquired non-U.S. Merrill Lynch
wealth-management units from Bank of America Corp. The company
has already paid out remuneration to  executives  for last year
and plans to issue additional integration awards.  Collardi, 38, also had 6.3 million francs in loans as of
Dec. 31, compared with 4.1 million francs a year earlier, the
report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
