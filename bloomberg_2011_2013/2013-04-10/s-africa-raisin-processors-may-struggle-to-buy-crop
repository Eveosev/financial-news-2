South African raisin processors may
struggle to pay farmers on time for the full crop this year
because of the biggest harvest since at least 1998, a growers
group said.  “ South Africa  produced 37,900 tons of raisins last year
and the crop is expected to exceed 50,000 tons this year,”
Dappie Smit, general manager of the Dried Fruit Technical
Services, a branch of the Paarl, South Africa-based  Deciduous
Fruit Producers’ Trust , said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows the crop would be
the biggest in at least 16 years, with 1998 being the first year
for which data is available. South  Africa  is Africa’s biggest
producer of the fruit and accounts for about 3 to 4 percent of
world production, according to the trust.  The bigger crop is due to good drying weather conditions
and higher prices for raisins rather than wine, Smit said.
Producers and processors will now have to agree on an extended
period to buy the entire crop.  “This caused growers to dry grapes which would normally
have been manufactured into wine,” according to Smit.  The global raisin export industry is dominated by the U.S.,
 Turkey  and  Iran , according to the data.  South African grapes grown for raisins are harvested
between the middle of January and the middle of April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
