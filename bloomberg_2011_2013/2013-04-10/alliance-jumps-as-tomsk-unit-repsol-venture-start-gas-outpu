Alliance Oil Co. Ltd. (AOIL) , a Russian
oil and gas producer traded in  Stockholm , rose the most in more
than six weeks, after the start of natural gas projects boosted
total output.  Alliance climbed as much as 4.6 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Feb. 21, and traded up 4 percent at 53.60
kronor at 12:43 p.m. in Stockholm.  March total output rose to an average 62,304 barrels of oil
equivalent a day. That is a 20 percent increase from 51,982
barrels a day in January, the company said in a statement today.  Oil output expanded 2.4 percent to 53,214 barrels a day,
while natural gas added 9,090 barrels a day from zero in
January, according to a statement.  Repsol SA (REP)  and Alliance formed the A&R Oil and Gas BV
venture this year. In March, the venture announced the start of
gas output in Siberia. Separately, Alliance started gas
production in Tomsk in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
