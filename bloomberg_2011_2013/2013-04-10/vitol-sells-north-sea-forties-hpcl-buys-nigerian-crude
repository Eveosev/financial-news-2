Vitol Group sold a cargo of  North
Sea  Forties crude, its eighth since March 28, as the price
dropped to the lowest in more than a week.  Hindustan Petroleum Corp.,  India ’s third-largest state
refiner, bought 2 million barrels of  Nigeria ’s Qua Iboe from
Vitol via tender for loading from June 1 to June 30, according
to three people with knowledge of the matter.  North Sea  Vitol sold the Forties cargo to Total SA for loading April
25 to April 27 at 35 cents less than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That’s 5 cents lower than an April 8 trade at
minus 30 and is the lowest since April 2, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Total also bid unsuccessfully for Forties for loading April
24 to April 29 at 35 cents a barrel, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 4 cents to a discount of 26 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent futures for May settlement traded at $105.64 a barrel
on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $104.78 yesterday. The June contract was
$105.68 at that time today, a premium of 4 cents to May.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals crude, the
Platts survey showed.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 4 cents to 66 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That was the least since Feb. 1. In northwest
Europe, the  discount  was at $2.06 a barrel versus $2.10 at
yesterday’s close.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped 4 cents to $3.45
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The loading programs for Nigerian and Angolan crude for
June are due to be published next week.  Nigerian authorities recovered 10 bodies of policemen
killed in an April 6 attack by gunmen in the oil-rich Niger
River delta, while two remain missing, Bayelsa state Police
