Prevention of tuberculosis, the
world’s second-deadliest infectious disease, may unintentionally
boost drug resistance of more dangerous strains of the bacteria,
especially among HIV-infected patients, according to a study.  Treating an entire community with the generic drug
isoniazid can increase the likelihood of drug resistance in a
population, calling into question large-scale public health
interventions, said researchers led by  Harriet Mills  of the
 University of Bristol  in the U.K. Their study was published
today in  Science Translational Medicine .  The  World Health Organization  recommends giving isoniazid
to HIV-infected individuals as they are more likely to develop
severe tuberculosis compared with healthier people. Tuberculosis
killed 1.4 million people in 2011, lagging only AIDS in deaths.
While TB can be cured with antibiotics, strains of the bacterium
that resist most drugs afflict about 630,000 people globally.  The study was funded by the Bristol Centre for Complexity
Sciences, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
Council, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.  In a study published in August, almost half of TB patients
who had received prior treatment were resistant to a second-line
drug, suggesting the disease may become “virtually
untreatable.”  For Related News and Information:
