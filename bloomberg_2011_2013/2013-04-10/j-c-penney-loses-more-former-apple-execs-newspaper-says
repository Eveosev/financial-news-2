J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  denied a New York
Post report that three top executives quit yesterday, two days
after the board ousted Chief Executive Officer Ron Johnson.  Chief Operating Officer Michael Kramer, Chief Creative
Officer Michael Fisher and Chief Talent Officer Daniel Walker
are still employed by the company, Daphne Avila, a J.C. Penney
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today. The Post said yesterday
that they had left, citing people it didn’t name. The three
worked with Johnson when he ran  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s retail unit and
joined the department-store chain after he became its CEO in
November 2011.  J.C. Penney, the third-largest U.S. department-store chain,
removed Johnson after his pricing and merchandising strategies
caused a 25 percent sales drop and a $985 million net loss last
year. Johnson was replaced by Myron E. Ullman III, the CEO he
succeeded about 17 months ago, after being tapped by activist
investor  William Ackman , the retailer’s largest investor.  J.C. Penney  rose  4.2 percent to $14.68 at 1:30 p.m. in New
York. At that price, the Plano, Texas-based company’s shares
have declined 7.5 percent since the CEO change was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
