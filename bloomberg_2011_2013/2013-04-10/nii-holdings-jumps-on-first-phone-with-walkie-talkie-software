NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , which offers
Nextel mobile-phone service in Mexico, rose to the highest in
more than two months after announcing the first phone with its
new software for walkie-talkie communications.  NII, based in Reston, Virginia, jumped 14 percent at $7.39
at the close in New York, its highest closing price since Jan.
28. The shares are up 3.6 percent this year, compared with an 11
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The software on the phone, Motorola Mobility’s Atrix HD,
can also be used in other devices that operate on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android platform, said  Chris King , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus
& Co. That means NII will be able to offer walkie-talkie service
on popular Android phones such as Samsung Electronics Co.’s
Galaxy devices, he said today in a note. He advises buying the
shares.  NII has traditionally used a network technology called IDEN
to offer walkie-talkie service, in which users can communicate
with quick bursts of conversation. By switching to software that
works over mobile Internet connections, it can offer a wider
variety of devices to better compete with America Movil SAB and
 Telefonica SA. (TEF)   To contact the reporter on this story:
