ARC Resources Ltd. (ARX) , the third-
largest oil and gas operator in Canada’s Montney formation, rose
after analysts at BMO Capital Markets recommended investors
purchase shares of natural gas producers over oil-related
stocks.  Arc Resources increased 3.2 percent to C$27.44 at 10:56
a.m. in Toronto after surging 3.6 percent earlier, the most
intraday in two months.  A decline in drilling activity for gas along with higher
demand for the fuel have helped to reduce storage levels, wrote
 Randy Ollenberger , a Calgary-based analyst with BMO Capital
Markets, in a note to clients today. Price for gas trading at
 Henry Hub  may reach $4 per million cubic feet this year, he
said.  “We continue to grow more bullish on gas prices,”
Ollenberger in the note. “The steady drop in the gas rig count
coupled with the erosion of the storage glut has provided an
opportunity for gas prices to trade higher in 2013.”  Arc Resources,based in Calgary, was among five gas-weighted
companies recommended by BMO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
