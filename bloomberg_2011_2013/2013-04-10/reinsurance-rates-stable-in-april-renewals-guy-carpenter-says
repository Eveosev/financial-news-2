Reinsurance prices remained little
changed in the April renewal round, a significant date for
setting costs in the Asia Pacific region, after supply of
available capital increased,  Guy Carpenter  & Co. LLC said.  “Pricing stabilized in most regions as insurers benefited
from an environment of dynamic capital growth,” David Flandro,
 Global Head  of Business Intelligence at the New York-based agent
and broker, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Reinsurers, which help primary insurers shoulder risks in
return for a share of premiums, accumulated a record $500
billion of capital by the end of last year, pushing up supply by
more than 10 percent, Aon Benfield, the world’s largest
reinsurance broker, said in a report this month. After lower
insurance losses and higher investment income last year, prices
are expected to remain unchanged in 2013 while lower  interest
rates  may weigh on earnings, it said.  In  Japan , reinsurance rates fell slightly as there were no
major natural catastrophes, Guy Carpenter said. Korea had a
turbulent year with three typhoons pushing up prices, it said.  Renewals for U.S. clients were few but “sizable” with
“traditional pricing down generally in the single digit
range,” the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
