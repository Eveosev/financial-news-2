Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO) , the
second-biggest U.S. dollar-store retailer, forecast that  profit 
this year will be less than it previously expected as shoppers
curb discretionary spending.  Profit in the current fiscal year will be as much as $3.93
a share, the Matthews, North Carolina-based company said today
in a statement. That’s down from a January forecast of as much
as $4.20 and less than the $3.96 average  estimate  of 27 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Demand for apparel, home decor and other non-essential
items remains less than anticipated, the company said. Sales by
stores open more than 13 months rose 2.9 percent in the second
quarter, trailing estimates by Citigroup Inc. and Guggenheim
Securities.  “We chalk this weakness up to soft discretionary sales,”
 John Heinbockel , an analyst at Guggenheim in New York, wrote
today in a note. He recommends buying Family Dollar shares.  Heinbockel and Citigroup’s  Deborah Weinswig  had projected
comparable-store sales would advance 4.5 percent.  The shares rose 1.1 percent to $60.44 at the close in New
York. They have dropped 4.7 percent this year, compared with an
11 percent  gain  for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  By revenue, Family Dollar trails  Dollar General Corp. (DG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
