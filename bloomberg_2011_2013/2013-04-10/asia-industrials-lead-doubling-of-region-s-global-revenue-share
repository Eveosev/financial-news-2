Asian industrial companies,
including South Korea’s  SK Holdings Co. (003600)  and  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  of
Hong Kong, have lead the region’s doubling of global revenue
share since 2005, a Citigroup Inc. study shows.  The share of companies in Asia, excluding  Japan , jumped to
27 percent of total revenue at the sector’s top 20 global firms
last year, according to the Citigroup study. In 2005 they
garnered 11 percent.  Revenue increases by  technology  and energy companies
rounded out the region’s top three gainers in the period,
according to the study. Telecommunication, auto and
semiconductor revenue also rose.  “The coverage of Asia’s leading corporates is a strategic
priority for Citi in Asia across its 18 markets in Asia
Pacific,” said James Griffiths, a Citigroup spokesman based in
Hong Kong. “Citi also offers these companies access to its
global network in over 100 countries, helping Asia’s corporates
expand globally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
