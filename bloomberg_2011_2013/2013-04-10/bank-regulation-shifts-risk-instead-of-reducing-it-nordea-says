Efforts to regulate financial
markets will transfer risk to investors from banks instead of
reducing it,  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  said.  “The credit risk on counterparties becomes  liquidity risk 
through central counterparties and collateral demands,”
Nordea’s Helsinki-based Head of Research Aki Kangasharju and
Analyst Suvi Kosonen said in a report today. “Central
counterparties may become too big to fail.”  Europe ’s bank regulation is being tightened in the
aftermath of the global credit crunch to shatter the link
between banks and sovereigns that worsened the euro-area debt
crisis. Banks will have to amass more capital and match lending
with the funds raised on the market to ensure they can sustain
losses.  The liquidity on investment grade bonds will decline,
because they’ll be used as collateral for derivatives trading at
central counterparties and acquired for use as banks’ risk
buffers, according to Nordea. The lower liquidity will augment
market volatility and risk, the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
