Bond investors are betting  Vestas
Wind Systems A/S (VWS) ’s strategy to generate more cash is working.  Since the 4.625 percent 600 million-euro ($786 million)
bond due 2015 reached a low on May 21, it has returned investors
50.4 percent, including reinvested interest, according to data
available on Bloomberg. Denmark’s two-year government note has
returned 1.5 percent in the same period, while Vestas  shares 
have gained 23 percent.  “Vestas is progressing with its restructuring and
improving on credit metrics,” Kasper From Larsen, an analyst at
Danske Bank A/S, who has a buy rating on the bond, said in a
phone interview. “They are adjusting their capacity to reflect
the demand in the market.”  The bond soared today to its highest since Feb. 8, 2012,
after the yield dropped 1.8 percentage points. The performance
underscores a turnaround at Vestas as targeted contracts get
signed and payments replenish cash flow. The company now looks
poised to deliver a similar recovery to German competitor  Nordex
SE (NDX1) , Larsen said. The Nordex 6.375 percent bond due 2016 yielded
5.1 percent today compared with 16.2 percent on May 14 last
year, according to Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader.  Nordex Model  The traded yield on Vestas’s euro bond eased to 10.74
percent as of 1:08 p.m. in Copenhagen, from 18.15 percent on
Jan. 2. The yield peaked at 26.1 percent on May 21 last year,
according to Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader.  “Nordex has come the farthest in restructuring and seen a
nice uptick in customer orders,” Larsen said. “They are about
six to nine months ahead of Vestas.”  Vestas, which is vying with  General Electric Co. (GE)  for the
lead in the global wind turbine market, has lost money for two
years as overcapacity in the industry pushed down prices. Even
after this year’s 47 percent gain, Vestas’s  shares  are down 94
percent since an August 2008 peak.  Vestas lost 963 million euros last year and 166 million
euros in 2011 after making a total of 1.65 billion euros in net
income in the five years before that, according to stock
exchange filings. It is halfway through a two-year push to cut
its workforce by about 30 percent to 16,000 and aims to sell
factories to reduce costs and align production capacity with
market demand.  Bank Accord  The Aarhus, Denmark-based company persuaded a group of nine
banks in November to provide loans until January 2015 through a
new 900 million-euro credit line. That’s 400 million euros
smaller, and due one year earlier, than a previous facility. The
maturity can be extended by as much as two years.  Vestas forecast “positive” free cash flow for 2013,
without giving a specific number. Though it had a similar target
for last year, Vestas ended up posting a negative free cash flow
of 359 million euros. It generated 416 million euros of free
cash in the fourth quarter last year, allowing it to cut net
debt by 387 million euros.  “Worries that they might run out of cash have been dialed
down,” Janne Vincent Kjaer, an analyst at Jyske Bank A/S who
has a buy rating on the Vestas bond, said in a phone interview.
“Everyone will be looking at the free cash flow for the first
quarter.” The Vestas bond has reached her 12-month yield target
of 11 percent.  Order Intake  Vestas more than doubled its year-to-date order intake on
Monday with a 299-megawatt turbine contract signed with a
Canadian joint venture of EDF Renewable Energy and Enbridge Inc.  “The order is of a nice size, but more important is the
customer,” Larsen said. “EDF is a large utility customer that
signed a large order and a 20-year maintenance contract. That’s
a large customer that says they see you around for a long
time.”  Vestas will generate free cash flow of about 123 million
euros this year, according to a  Bloomberg survey  of 10 analysts.
The estimates range from as low as minus 79 million euros to as
high as a positive cash flow of 290 million euros.  “The first two quarters of the last financial year were
quite nasty, so year-on-year we expect an improvement in cash
flow generation,” Larsen said. “I expect a meaningful recovery
in orders, but they won’t go back to the strength of 2010 and
2011 this year. In the past they have probably taken too many
orders of low profitability.”  In February, Vestas reduced this year’s shipments forecast
to an interval of 4 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts of turbines from
previous guidance of about 5 gigawatts.  The company’s Bloomberg  default risk rating , a measure
based on Vestas’s reported earnings, operating performance and
market information, fell to 0.124 percent today from 1.9 percent
on Dec. 11. That compares with a 0.006 percent default risk
rating for  Siemens AG (SIE)  and 0.14 percent for Nordex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
