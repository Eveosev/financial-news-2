Poland ’s currency slumped for the
first time in five days ahead of the Monetary Policy Council’s
interest rates decision today.  Economists unanimously expect rates will stay unchanged at
an all-time low of 3.25 percent after a total 150 basis points
of cuts since November, according to a  survey  by Bloomberg.
Governor  Marek Belka  said after last month’s reduction that the
rate panel had adopted a “wait-and-see” approach. Nine-month
forward rate agreements are trading 50 basis points below the
Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate, signaling two more rate cuts by
the end of the year.  “From the point of view of market expectations, today’s
decision of the council and the statement may turn out to be
slightly disappointing,”  BRE Bank SA (BRE)  economists, led by Ernest Pytlarczyk, write in note.  The zloty depreciated 0.1 percent to 4.1190 per euro at
11:19 a.m. in Warsaw. The currency climbed 2 percent in the last
four days as increased foreign inflows to Poland’s debt market
cut yields on government debt to records.  Polish 10-year  bond yields  fell the most last week since
August 2010 and dipped to a record intra-day low of 3.48 percent
on April 8. The yields fell three basis point to 3.57 percent
today after rising nine basis points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
