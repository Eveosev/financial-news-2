Cooking oil imports  by  India , the
world’s largest  palm oil  buyer, probably advanced for a fourth
straight month in March on rising domestic demand and a decline
in global prices.  Purchases of vegetable oils, including those for industrial
use, climbed 17 percent to 850,000 metric tons last month from
727,706 tons a year earlier, according to the median of
estimates from five processors and brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. Palm oil imports surged 50 percent to 700,000 tons
from 465,484 tons, the survey showed.  The Solvent Extractors’
Association of India  will release the data tomorrow.  The surge in Indian imports may help trim palm oil
stockpiles in Indonesia and  Malaysia , the biggest producers, and
stem a 34 percent decline in prices in  Kuala Lumpur  in the past
year. Futures have fallen for four straight quarters in the
worst run since 1999 on concern that demand will slow in  Europe 
because of the debt crisis, boosting inventories.  “Consumption is increasing, while the local production is
not enough to meet this demand,” Govindlal G. Patel, managing
partner at GG Patel & Nikhil Research Co., said by phone. An
increase in domestic rapeseed oil supplies may curb imports this
month, he said.  India’s monthly domestic demand is about 1.45 million tons
and is growing 5 percent annually, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief
executive officer at Mumbai-based broker Sunvin Group. Imports
of all cooking oils may surge to a record 11.5 million tons in
the year that started Nov. 1, Vijay Data, president of the
extractors’ association, said on Feb. 4.  Indonesia, Malaysia  The South Asian nation, the world’s biggest cooking oil
consumer after  China , meets more than half its demand through
imports. It buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and
 soybean oil  from the U.S., Brazil and  Argentina .  “Domestically refined  oil prices  are higher than imported
oil as soybean prices have gone up in the last few months and
farmers are holding back their crops,” Ashok Sethia, executive
director of Sethia Oils, said by phone from Kolkata.  Palm oil for delivery in June fell 1 percent to 2,371
ringgit ($783) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange
yesterday. Reserves in Malaysia fell 11 percent to 2.17 million
tons in March from a month earlier, the steepest drop since
January 2011, according to the nation’s palm oil board.  Cooking oil imports jumped 22 percent to 3.74 million tons
in the four months through February, according to the
extractors’ association. Stockpiles, including those at ports
and in the pipeline, probably shrank to 1.6 million tons at the
beginning of this month from a record 1.96 million tons in
March, Bajoria said.  “Imports will slow now as stockpiles are high and
importers will not be in a hurry to replace supplies,” Pradip
Desai, managing director of Mumbai-based broker Palmtrade
Services Pvt., said.  Crude soybean oil imports  fell 40 percent to 60,000 tons in
March from 100,615 tons a year earlier, while sunflower oil
purchases may have fallen to 80,000 tons from 104,150 tons, the
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
