The captains of the two vessels
that collided off Lamma island last October are expected to be
charged with manslaughter today, the  South China Morning Post 
said, without saying where it got the information.  The five crew members from the two boats arenâ€™t expected to
be charged, the report said.  Hong Kong  in December began an inquiry into the deadly
ferry crash that killed 39 people, the worst maritime disaster
in four decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
