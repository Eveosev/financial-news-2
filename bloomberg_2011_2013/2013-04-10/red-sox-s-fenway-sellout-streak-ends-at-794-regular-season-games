(Corrects to show Trail Blazers having second-longest
streak in ninth paragraph.)  The  Boston  Red Sox’s record sellout
streak at Fenway Park came to an end after 820 games over nearly
10 years before last night’s 8-5 loss to the Baltimore Orioles.  The run of full houses began on May 15, 2003, a year before
the Red Sox ended an 86-year championship drought with the first
of two World Series titles in four seasons. The club averaged
36,605 tickets sold per game during the streak, which totaled
794 regular-season games and another 26 in the postseason, the
Red Sox said in an e-mailed news release.  Attendance for Boston’s second home game this season was
30,862, which was 6,638 below the 37,500-seat capacity.  “The streak is a reflection of a phenomenal period of
baseball in Boston,” Red Sox owner John W. Henry said in the
release. “It’s a testament to the baseball passion of New
England fans.”  Red Sox President Larry Lucchino said in February that the
streak probably would end early this season, based on ticket
sales projections after the club went 69-93 in 2012 -- its worst
record since 1965 -- and two years after blowing a nine-game
September lead for a wild-card playoff berth.  ‘Historic Achievement’  “We are proud of this historic achievement,” Lucchino
said in yesterday’s statement. “Over the past 10 years, more
than 30 million -- many among the most sophisticated baseball
fans in America -- have purchased tickets to see games at Fenway
Park.”  Sam Kennedy, the team’s chief operating officer, said as
the season began that the streak would “rest in peace.” The
Red Sox are offering discounted beer and two-for-one hot dogs
for adults and free food for children under 15 throughout April
as a way to say thank you to fans, Kennedy said.  Fenway Park is Major League Baseball’s oldest stadium,
opening on April 20, 1912. During the run of sellouts, the Red
Sox spent about $285 million on renovations, the team said in
its statement.  The Cleveland Indians hold MLB’s second-longest sellout
streak at 455 games from 1995 to 2001. The National Basketball
Association’s Portland Trail Blazers rank second for the longest
streak among U.S. major professional sports clubs, selling out
814 home games in a row, including postseason, from 1977 to
1995.  The San Francisco Giants, who won the World Series in 2010
and 2012, now have the longest active regular-season home
sellout streak. The Giants, who beat the Colorado Rockies 10-0
last night at AT&T Park, have sold out 171 straight since Oct.
1, 2010.  First Place  The Fenway Park streak ends with the Red Sox (5-3) leading
the American League East by one game over the Orioles.  Boston led 5-3 last night going into the ninth before Chris Davis led off the final inning with a solo home run. Boston
reliever Joel Hanrahan then walked two batters to load the bases
before throwing a wild pitch that brought pinch runner Alexi Casilla home to tie it at 5-5.  Manny Machado hit the next pitch over the Green Monster to
score Chris Dickerson and Nate McLouth before Jim Johnson earned
his third save for Baltimore (4-4). The two teams play again
tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
