Spanish mortgage loans are starting
to show the “first cracks” in their quality, said  Alberto Gallo , head of European macro credit research at  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc .  The risk that mortgage loan default rates could double in
the next three years is “a good guess, having looked at the
experience of other periphery countries,” Gallo said on a
conference call with reporters today. Asset risk will continue
to erode bank capital across the so-called European periphery
including Spain and Italy, he said in a report published.  While this will mean lower profitability for stronger
banks, “weaker lenders may not be able to earn their way out of
bad loans and could have to use subordinated debt to
recapitalize themselves,” London-based Gallo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
