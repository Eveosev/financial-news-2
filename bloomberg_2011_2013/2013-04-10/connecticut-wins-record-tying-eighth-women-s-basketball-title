The University of  Connecticut 
secured its record-tying eighth women’s college basketball
championship with a 93-60 rout of the University of Louisville,
the largest margin of victory in a title game.  Freshman Breanna Stewart scored 23 points and had nine
rebounds last night to lead the Huskies, who matched the
University of Tennessee for the most titles in women’s college
basketball history. Connecticut is 8-0 in the title game of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, with all
eight championships coming under coach Geno Auriemma. Former
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt also won eight titles.  “The fact that I tied Pat Summitt’s record, that puts you
in the category of the greatest women’s basketball coach that’s
ever lived,” Auriemma said in a televised interview. “I’m
thrilled for this group of girls and these seniors.”  UConn’s 33-point rout surpassed  Tennessee ’s 23-point win
over Louisiana Tech in 1987 as the largest winning margin in the
32-year history of the women’s NCAA championship game. The
Huskies’ biggest previous margin of victory in a title game was
22 points in 2009, a 76-54 win over Louisville.  Connecticut last night raced to a 48-29 halftime lead
against a Louisville team that had eliminated defending champion
Baylor in the round of 16 as a No. 5 regional seed before
beating Tennessee and  California  to reach the title game.
Louisville’s men two days ago won their third national title and
first since 1986 by beating Michigan in Atlanta.  While the 6-foot-4 Stewart became the fourth freshman to be
named the Most Outstanding Player, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis had 18
points and nine rebounds, and senior Kelly Faris added 16 points,
nine rebounds and six assists.  Victory Margin  UConn won its six tournament games by an average of 23.7
points, including an 83-65 rout of Notre Dame in the national
semifinals two days ago. The Huskies had been beaten by Notre
Dame at the Final Four each of the previous two years and lost
to the Fighting Irish three times during the regular season,
including in the Big East Conference tournament last month.  “Our players just collectively decided to give up a little
of themselves,” Auriemma said. “Before that, we were a team of
good players, but right after that we became a great team. It
was an amazing transformation.”  Connecticut now has eight titles in 19 years, having also
won the NCAA tournament in 1995, 2000, 2002-04 and 2009-10.  The Huskies have the highest NCAA tournament winning
percentage in women’s college basketball history, with an
overall 91-17 record. All of those victories have come under
Auriemma, who’s been at the school in Storrs, Connecticut, since
1985. Only Summitt has more women’s tournament wins, with 112.  UConn is now 13-1 against Louisville, with its only loss
coming in the first round of the 1993 NCAA tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
