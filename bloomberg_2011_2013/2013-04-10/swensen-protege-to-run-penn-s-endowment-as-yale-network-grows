The University of Pennsylvania has
hired Peter Ammon to oversee investments in its endowment and
pension plan, which have a combined $7.8 billion of assets.  Ammon, a director in Yale University’s investments office,
will begin on July 1, Penn said yesterday in a  statement .  Ammon currently works for Yale Chief Investment Officer
 David Swensen , who helped reinvent how colleges manage their
assets by advocating buying harder-to-sell securities. Ammon
joins a group of Swensen proteges who left Yale to run other
sizable endowments, including Andrew Golden at  Princeton
University  and Seth Alexander at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.  “Peter is a remarkably talented investment manager with
impressively wide and successful experience across asset
classes,”  Amy Gutmann , Penn’s president, said in the statement.
She called him “the right person” to maximize the school’s
long-term returns.  Ammon replaces Kristen Gilbertson, who stepped down last
year after eight years running Penn’s investment office.  Philadelphia-based Penn, one of the eight Ivy League
schools in the northeastern U.S., posted an investment gain of
1.6 percent in the year ended June 30, down from a 19 percent
increase the year prior.  It has the  11th-largest  university endowment with $6.8
billion of assets, according to the National Association of
College and University Business Officers and Commonfund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
