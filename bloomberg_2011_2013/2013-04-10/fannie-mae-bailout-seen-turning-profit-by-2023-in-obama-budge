Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac (FMCC) , the
U.S.-owned mortgage-finance companies, could return billions of
dollars in profits to taxpayers who bailed them out in 2008,
White House budget analysts said today.  Payments to the Treasury Department by Washington-based
 Fannie Mae  and McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac through fiscal
year 2023 are projected to exceed by $51 billion the U.S. aid
they have received under federal conservatorship, according to
President Barack Obama’s spending plan released today. Last
year’s budget saw a $28 billion loss through 2022.  The companies’ return to profitability while they’re still
not technically on the government’s balance sheet raises
pressure to resolve their future, said Tim Rood, a partner in
the Collingwood Group LLC, a Washington-based financial services
consulting firm.  “It begs the question of whether some sort of public-
private partnership wouldn’t be a reasonable solution,” Rood
said in a telephone interview.  Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac , which were created by the
federal government before becoming publicly traded companies,
buy mortgages from lenders and package them into securities on
which they guarantee payments of principal and interest.  Since they were seized by regulators amid soaring losses in
2008, the two companies have drawn $187.5 billion from Treasury
and have sent back $65.2 billion in dividends, which count as a
return on the government’s investment and not as a repayment.  Steady Profits  The companies have begun reporting steady profits as home
prices have been rising. Fannie Mae reported net income of $17.2
billion for 2012, outpacing profits at S&P 500 companies such as
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ,  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company reported a $16.9 billion loss in 2011.  Freddie Mac reported in February that it earned $11 billion
in 2012, compared with a loss of $5.3 billion in 2011.  Under the terms of an agreement with Treasury that went
into effect this year, the enterprises will be allowed to retain
only $3 billion in net worth. Any profits beyond that amount
will go to taxpayers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
