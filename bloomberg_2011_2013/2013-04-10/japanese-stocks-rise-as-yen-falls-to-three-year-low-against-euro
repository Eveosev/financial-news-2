Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
 Topix (TPX)  Index capping its longest win streak this year, on
optimism the yen’s weakness will improve the earnings outlook
for exporters.  Exporters to  Europe  Nintendo Co. and  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) 
jumped more than 10 percent after the yen reached a three-year
low against the euro. Cosmo Oil Co. surged 11 percent on a
report the refiner’s pretax profit for the year ending March
2014 may increase 50 percent.  Hitachi Construction Machinery
Co. (6305) , a machinery maker that gets 17 percent of its revenue in
 China , gained 2.3 percent after imports to the world’s second-
biggest economy surged 14 percent.  The Topix advanced 1.7 percent to close at 1,121.04 in
 Tokyo  with about two stocks rising for each that fell. It capped
a six-day rally, the longest streak since December. The  Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 0.7 percent to 13,288.13. Volume was 54
percent above the 30-day average. Shares maintained gains after
China reported a trade deficit in March and amid concern  North
Korea  may conduct a missile test.  “The yen’s drop will lift earnings naturally,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based equity strategist at Nissay Asset Management
Corp., which oversees about 5 trillion yen ($50 billion.)
“Japan has done fairly aggressive monetary easing without
drawing criticism from other nations, which makes me think the
yen will stay in a downtrend for a while.”  The Topix surged 55 percent from mid-November as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation. The gauge traded at 1.3
 times book value  compared with 2.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Unprecedented Stimulus  The BOJ on April 4 said it will double the monetary base by
the end of 2014 by buying  government bonds , its boldest round of
quantitative easing. The central bank is scheduled to make the
next policy announcement on April 26.  The yen has weakened against all of its 16 major
counterparts this year on speculation the BOJ’s stimulus will
debase the currency. The yen reached 130.09 per euro yesterday,
the lowest level since January 2010. A weaker yen boosts the
value of overseas earnings at Japanese exporters when
repatriated home.  Nintendo, a maker of video-game players that depends on
Europe for a third of its sales, soared 11 percent to 11,850
yen, the biggest gain since 2008. Nippon Sheet Glass Co., a
glass maker that gets 41 percent of its sales in Europe, surged
13 percent to 117 yen, the most since Feb. 5.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a
camera maker that gets 79 percent of its revenue abroad, rose 2
percent to 3,545 yen.  Fed Minutes  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  advanced 0.1 percent before
the  Federal Open Market Committee  releases minutes of its March
19-20 meeting today. The gauge rose 0.4 percent yesterday on
optimism over earnings and as commodities gained after a report
showed China’s inflation rate slowed, easing pressure on policy
makers to tighten credit.  China’s exports increased 10 percent in March from a year
earlier, the customs administration said today in Beijing. That
compares with 21.8 percent growth in February and the 11.7
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 36
economists. Imports rose by an above-forecast 14.1 percent,
leaving an unexpected trade deficit of $880 million.  Japanese exporters to China advanced with Hitachi
Construction adding 2.3 percent to 2,230 yen.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a maker
of electronics components that depends on China for 27 percent
of its sales, rose 4.2 percent to 3,390 yen.  Cosmo Oil jumped 11 percent to 220 yen after the Nikkei
newspaper reported its pretax profit for the year ending March
2014 may rise 50 percent to 60 billion yen on a weaker yen and
the valuation of oil inventory, without attribution.  Earnings Results  Aeon Co., Japan’s biggest retailer, gained 5.7 percent to
1,352 yen before reporting its results tomorrow after the market
closes. It’s among 17 companies on the 1,698-member Topix set to
report earnings tomorrow, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Universal Entertainment Corp., a gaming company, plunged 16
percent to 1,666 yen as Chairman Kazuo Okada faces a U.S.
criminal investigation related to his Philippine casino project.  The U.S. asked to intervene in a lawsuit brought by Wynn
Resorts Ltd., which accused Okada of making improper payments to
Philippine gaming regulators. The  Justice Department  said in an
April 8 filing in state court in  Las Vegas  that it doesn’t want
the civil case to disrupt its criminal investigation into the
same underlying allegations.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  dropped 4.1
percent to 28.43, indicating traders expect a swing of about 8
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
