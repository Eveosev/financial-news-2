Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) , the largest publicly traded copper producer, said its
foray into oil and natural gas is based on a “magnificent
opportunity” rather than a reflection of copper’s prospects.  The company agreed to buy  Plains Exploration & Production
Co. (PXP)  and  McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)  for $9 billion to “not lose an
opportunity,” Javier Targhetta, senior vice president of
marketing and sales, told reporters in Santiago, Chile today.  Freeport’s shares fell the most in four years on Dec. 5
when it announced an acquisition that marks the Phoenix-based
company’s return to energy after 18 years. McMoRan was spun off
from Freeport-McMoRan Inc. in 1994.  The board considered the deal “a magnificent opportunity
to enter into the world of oil and gas,” Targhetta said today.
The assets also offer a “natural hedge” for mining, he said.  Shares fell 0.3 percent to $33.66 at 12:02 p.m. in New
York. The stock is down 12 percent since the deal was announced
compared with a 1.6 percent decline by  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s biggest mining company.  Freeport, which mines in the U.S., Indonesia, Africa and
Chile, expects annual demand for copper to increase 3.2 percent
through 2025, led by China and other  emerging markets , Targhetta
said in a presentation today.  The company doesn’t see “a light at the end of the
tunnel” yet for a European recovery, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
