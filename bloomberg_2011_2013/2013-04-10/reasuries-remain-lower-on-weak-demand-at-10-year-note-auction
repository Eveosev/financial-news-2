Treasuries fell for a third day
after minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting showing
several members in favor of pulling back on its bond-buying
program weighed on demand at the government’s 10-year auction.  The $21 billion in notes drew a yield of 1.795 percent,
compared with a forecast of 1.789 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of 10 of the Fed’s primary dealers. The minutes showed
that some Federal Open Market Committee members said the central
bank should stop by year-end its monthly $85 billion of Treasury
and mortgage-debt purchasing. Stocks rose to all-time highs.  “It’s partially because of the Fed and the risk-on
environment seeping in,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global
strategist at the broker-dealer BTIG LLC in New York. “There’s
a bit of optimism that hasn’t been present over the last couple
of days. People are getting excited believing it’s the next leg
up in equities and down in Treasuries.”  The  yield  on the current 10-year note rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.8 percent at 5 p.m. in
New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2
percent note due February 2023 fell 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 3/4. The yield dropped to 1.68 percent on
April 5, the lowest level since Dec. 12.  Thirty-year  bond yields  rose seven basis points to 3
percent, touching that level for the first time since April 4.  The Standard & Poor’s  500 Index (SPX)  rose to an intraday record
of 1,589.07.  ‘Slow Purchases’  U.S. government securities were the least costly since
April 2 with the 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, at
negative 0.76 percent. It touched negative 0.82 percent on April
5, the most expensive level since December. A negative reading
indicates investors are willing to accept yields below what’s
considered fair value.  “Fed Minutes express increasing caution on length of QE,”
 Bill Gross , co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment
Management Co., manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, wrote
in a Twitter post. It “puts focus on an extended policy rate.”
Gross recommended investors purchase five- to 10-year
securities.  The FOMC members “thought that if the outlook for labor
market conditions improved as anticipated, it would probably be
appropriate to slow purchases later in the year and to stop them
by year-end,” according to the record of the March 19-20
meeting released today in  Washington  ahead of the regularly
scheduled 2 p.m. time.  Jobs Report  Fed officials, who met before a Labor Department report
last week showed payroll growth of 88,000 in March was the
slowest in nine months, debated how and when to curtail asset
purchases that have swollen its balance sheet to a record $3.22
trillion.  The committee, led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , decided to
press on with $85 billion in monthly bond buying until the
labor-market outlook has “improved substantially.”  “The meeting minutes, from our perspective, didn’t really
mean a whole lot because of that 88,000 print,” said Mitchell Stapley, the  Grand Rapids , Michigan-based chief fixed-income
officer for Fifth Third Asset Management, which oversees $15
billion in assets. “All that number did on Friday was to
confirm the $85 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage-backed
purchases is going to go on.”  Notes Auction  The 10-year auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 2.79, compared with an average of 2.95 for the
previous 10 sales.  “The bid-to-cover was a little on the light side -- it’s
disappointing,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading
in New York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for
institutional investors. “There’s a lot of interest at 2
percent, there’s just not as much interest from 1.75-to-1.80
percent.”  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 37.3 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 36.9 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 29.1 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 23.2 percent at the last
10 auctions.  Ten-year  U.S. debt  has returned 0.7 percent this year, more
than the 0.4 percent gain in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
benchmark notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, compared with a
2.2 percent gain by Treasuries overall.  This is the second of three auctions this week as the
government  sells  $66 billion of notes and bonds. It auctioned
$32 billion of three-year securities yesterday and is due to
sell $13 billion of 30-year debt tomorrow. The sales will raise
$6.7 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by the
public total $59.3 billion, according to the Treasury.  To contact the reporters on this story:
