President  Dennis Lockhart  said he sees a risk regulators would
need to provide a taxpayer bailout when winding down a failing
financial institution.  “I conclude you can’t yet dismiss too-big-to-fail
intervention as a contingency,” Lockhart said today at the
conclusion of an Atlanta Fed conference on financial regulation
at Stone Mountain, Georgia. “This is more in the vein, to use a
medical metaphor, of treatment of a condition that is still with
us and likely to be with us for some time as opposed to a cure
of an illness that can be declared eradicated.”  The ability to liquidate large banking firms if needed is
“a work in progress,” Lockhart, 66, said. “But it is clear
that there are many practical matters that have to be tackled,
especially the cross-border questions that are really quite
complex.”  A former Georgetown University professor, Lockhart has led
the Atlanta Fed since 2007. The Atlanta Fed district includes
 Alabama , Florida, Georgia, and portions of Louisiana,
 Mississippi , and Tennessee.  To contact the reporters on this story:
