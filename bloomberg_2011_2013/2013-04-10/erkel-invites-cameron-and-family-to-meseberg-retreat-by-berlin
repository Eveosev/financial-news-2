German Chancellor Angela Merkel
invited British Prime Minister David Cameron and his family to
the German government’s guest house at Schloss Meseberg, outside
Berlin, this weekend.  Cameron will be accompanied by his wife Samantha and their
children on the visit to Meseberg, where they will stay
overnight from Friday to Saturday, Cameron’s spokesman, Jean- Christophe Gray, told reporters in  London  today.  “The invitation reflects the strong relationship that the
prime minister and the German chancellor have,” Gray said.  Merkel visited Cameron at the British prime minister’s
official country residence, Chequers, in October 2010, German
government spokesman Georg Streiter told reporters in Berlin on
April 5, announcing the return visit. The two leaders will
discuss bilateral European and international policy issues
including  Iran ’s nuclear program, the situation in  Syria  and the
Group of Eight summit in Northern Ireland, Streiter said. He
didn’t mention Cameron’s family.  Meseberg  is an 18th century Prussian manor house about 50
miles northwest of Berlin in former communist East Germany. It
was restored after German reunification in 1990 and opened as
the government’s guest house for visiting dignatories in 2007.
Merkel has a private weekend home nearby.  To contact the reporter on this story:
