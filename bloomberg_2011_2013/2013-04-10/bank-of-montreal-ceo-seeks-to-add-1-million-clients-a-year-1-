Bank of Montreal ,  Canada ’s fourth-
biggest lender, intends to add 1 million customers annually,
Chief Executive Officer William Downe said.  “One sure way to earn more income is to have more
customers,” Downe, 61, said today at the bank’s investor
meeting in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. “Every strategic building
block we’ve set in place over the past few years is lined up
against that opportunity -- to attract more customers, and more
business from our current customers.”  Bank of Montreal’s annual profit rose 35 percent to C$4.19
billion ($413 billion) for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31. The
Toronto-based firm’s earnings were boosted by its C$4.1 billion
takeover of Wisconsin lender Marshall & Ilsley Corp. in July
2011, which doubled the bank’s U.S. deposits and branches.  “We have fundamentally changed our position in the
marketplace,” Downe said in his speech. “The surest way to
convert this advantage into lasting value will be to accelerate
the growth of our customer base by turning non-customers into
new customers, and existing customers into lifelong
relationships.”  Bank of Montreal (BMO)   rose  1.2 percent to C$63.39 in Toronto and
has climbed 4.2 percent this year, the best performance among
Canada’s eight-largest banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
