Palm oil  stockpiles in  Malaysia ,
the world’s second-largest producer, fell the most in more than
two years to a seven-month low in March as exports gained for
the first time in five months, according to official data.  Inventories shrank 11 percent to 2.17 million metric tons
last month from 2.44 million tons in February, the steepest
monthly drop since January 2011, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board
said today. The decline exceeded the median estimate for a 7
percent drop to 2.27 million tons in a Bloomberg survey. Output
climbed 2.2 percent to 1.33 million tons, while  exports 
increased 10 percent to 1.54 million tons, the board said.  The decline in stockpiles of the commodity used in
everything from biofuels to candy to noodles may help stem a 34
percent slump in prices in Kuala Lumpur in the past year.
Futures may climb through May, trading between 2,400 ringgit
($791) and 2,700 ringgit a ton as Malaysia’s currency weakens
before elections and inventories drop in Indonesia and Malaysia,
the top producers,  Dorab Mistry , a director at Godrej
International Ltd., said March 22.  “I would perceive this as bullish data because the end-
stock is actually lower than market expectations,” said Ryan Long, vice president of futures and options at OSK Investment
Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Production is still quite slow,
especially in East Malaysia, so I wouldn’t expect stocks to
build up yet at the end of this month.”  Reserves may remain near 2 million tons in the next two
months, Long said. Shipments probably jumped in March as buyers
such as India and  China  replenished stockpiles, he said.  Exports from Malaysia gained 3.5 percent to 456,440 tons in
the first 10 days of this month from 441,025 tons in the same
period in March, surveyor Intertek said today.  Palm oil for June delivery ended the morning session little
changed at 2,397 ringgit a ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives
exchange. Prices could rally as high as 2,520 ringgit in the
next two weeks, Long said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
