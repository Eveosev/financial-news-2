Gold futures fell the most in five
months as Cyprus plans to sell the metal to raise money, while
minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting spurred speculation that
U.S. stimulus will be curbed.  Cypriot authorities committed to sell “the excess amount
of gold” owned by the state, yielding an estimated 400 million
euros ($522 million), according to a draft of a European
Commission report obtained by  Bloomberg News . Several members of
the  Federal Open Market Committee  said the U.S. central bank
should begin scaling back debt purchases, minutes from a March
meeting showed today. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of
equities rose to a record.  “Cyprus selling gold was a big blow,” Tom Power, a senior
commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said
in a telephone interview. “Prices were already under pressure
because of the Fed’s comments and the stock market rally.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell 1.8 percent to settle
at $1,558.80 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New York , the
biggest drop for a most-active contract since Nov. 2.  Cyprus had 13.9 metric tons (446,895 ounces) of gold as of
March 31, according to data from the World Gold Council. The
holdings were valued $696.6 million, based on today’s Comex
settlement.  Data from the London-based council data show the U.S. as
the top gold holder with 8,133.5 tons, followed by  Germany  with
3,391.3 tons. Cyprus was ranked 61st.  Bank Reserves  Central banks added 534.6 tons to reserves last year, the
most since 1964, partly to diversify their currency holdings,
according to the council. Barclays forecasts 300 tons of
purchases in both 2013 and 2014.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its three-month price target
to $1,530 from $1,615 and lowered its 12-month forecast to
$1,390 from $1,550, and said the turn in the price cycle is
accelerating as the  U.S. economy  strengthens.  “The end of quantitative easing is destructive for gold
as it’s taking inflation off the table,” Sterling Smith, a
Chicago-based commodity futures specialist at Citigroup Global
Markets Inc., said in a telephone interview. “The sentiment is
very bearish.”  The Fed is buying $85 billion of debt a month and has said
further improvement in the labor market is needed for the
central bank to consider reducing its record monetary easing.  Gold has dropped 7 percent this year after 12 straight
annual gains.  Holdings  in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded product backed by the metal, fell to 1,200.4
tons yesterday, the lowest since June 2011.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 0.8 percent to $27.653
an ounce on the Comex. The price has dropped 8.5 percent this
year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery slumped 1.7 percent to $720.85 an ounce. Earlier,
the price touched $704, the lowest since Jan. 15.  Platinum futures for July delivery dropped 1.5 percent to
$1,529.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
