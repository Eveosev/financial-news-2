Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said its Surface
Pro tablet and all other products meet or exceed warranty laws
in  China , denying a report in state media that its coverage of
the device falls short of local requirements.  Consistent with Chinese law, Surface Pro and its main
components are covered under a two-year warranty, Microsoft said
in an e-mailed response to questions, sent through Graham Norris
at Ogilvy Public Relations.  China National Radio on April 8 reported the company had a
one-year pledge for the Surface Pro. That followed a March 15
report by  China Central Television  that criticized Apple Inc.’s
customer service, which was followed by more than a dozen
similarly themed articles in the People’s Daily newspaper in the
past few weeks.  “We stand behind our products with a manufacturer’s
warranty, which is additional to our commitment to honor any
statutory obligation as either a manufacturer or retailer, to
repair or replace a faulty product,” Microsoft said in the
statement.  Microsoft, based in Redmond,  Washington , began selling
Surface tablets in China in October. The company’s first global
sale of the device was done in Beijing as it wooed local
consumers frustrated by long waits for Apple devices.  Shares in Microsoft advanced 2.2 percent to $30.27 at 10:59
a.m. in  New York , the highest intraday price in six months. The
stock had gained 11 percent so far this year through yesterday,
compared with a 10 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  -- Editors: Frank Longid, Subramaniam Sharma  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
