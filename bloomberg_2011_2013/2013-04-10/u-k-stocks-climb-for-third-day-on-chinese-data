U.K. stocks  advanced, posting the
biggest three-day rally since early January, as a report showed
Chinese imports increased more than forecast and as U.S.
equities surged to a record.  EasyJet (EZJ)  Plc jumped the most in a year as Citigroup Inc.
advised investors to buy shares in the discount carrier.
 International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  added 5.8 percent
after the board of Vueling Airlines SA supported its takeover
bid.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  climbed 5.7 percent after reporting
an increase in oil and gas production.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 74.16 points, or 1.2 percent, to
6,387.37 at the close of trading in  London , bringing the three-
day advance to 2.2 percent. The gauge has rallied 8.3 percent
this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget and
data fueled optimism the world’s biggest economy is recovering.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index also added 1.2 percent today,
and Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 1.8 percent.  “Chinese import numbers have got investors thinking that
 China  has become successful at boosting domestic demand,” said
 Michael Hewson , a market analyst at CMC Markets Plc in London.
“The volume is not what I would suggest is dynamic. I certainly
don’t think it’s a move that reflects an awful lot of
conviction. Having said that, you can’t buck the market. The
momentum is basically with the bulls and you’d be foolish to go
against that.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 was 9.3 percent less than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Chinese Trade  China’s imports rose by a better-than-forecast 14.1 percent
in March while export growth slowed to 10 percent from a year
earlier, the customs administration said in Beijing.  In the U.S., the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  climbed to its
highest intraday level ever today. Stocks rose even as minutes
from last month’s  Federal Reserve  meeting showed several
officials said the central bank should begin tapering its
quantitative easing program later this year.  The Federal Open Market Committee members “thought that if
the outlook for labor market conditions improved as anticipated,
it would probably be appropriate to slow purchases later in the
year and to stop them by year-end,” according to the record of
the March 19-20 FOMC meeting.  EasyJet gained 6.7 percent to 1,090 pence, rising for the
first time in six days. The stock was raised to buy from neutral
at Citigroup, which said it expects earnings per share at the
discount carrier to increase around 30 percent in 2013 and the
company’s cash flow will lead to dividend growth.  IAG Takeover  IAG added 5.8 percent to 250.9 pence, the biggest increase
since February. The British Airways parent won backing for its
bid for Vueling from the Spanish discount carrier’s board after

month high. The producer of energy and metals in India said
