The yen for a second day reached
the weakest level in four years, when it last traded at 100 per
dollar, as traders speculated  Bank of Japan (8301)  stimulus measures
will keep driving investors into higher-yielding currencies.  The Japanese currency traded within 0.2 percent of the 100-
yen level yesterday and within 0.1 percent today. The dollar
slid against most major peers as investors bet that central
banks around the world will maintain stimulus measures. The  New
Zealand dollar  climbed to the highest level since August 2011,
and the euro reached a six-week high against the greenback.  “The trend for weaker yen should continue, and in that
sense I don’t think it’s surprising that people are still
willing to sell the yen on strength,” Brian Daingerfield, a
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS
Securities unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a phone
interview. “We’ve been seeing some flow” that may be driving
the yen weaker.  The yen rose 0.1 percent to 99.68 per dollar at 5 p.m. in
New York after gaining 0.7 percent earlier following data that
showed Japanese investors sold foreign bonds last week. The
currency declined as much as 0.2 percent to 99.95, the weakest
since April 14, 2009. The dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.3099 per
euro and reached $1.3138, the weakest since Feb. 28. The 17-
nation common currency rose 0.1 percent to 130.58 yen.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners, touched 82.068, the lowest level since March 15,
before trading at 82.257, down 0.3 percent.  Kiwi Climbs  The New Zealand dollar gained for an eighth day against the
greenback, touching 86 U.S. cents for the first time in 1 1/2
years after reports showed the nation’s manufacturing expanded
last month and a gauge of  home prices  advanced. The currency,
nicknamed the kiwi, climbed as much as 1.2 percent to 86.76
cents, the highest since August 2011, before trading at 86.34,
up 0.7 percent.  The currency of  Canada , another exporter of commodities,
reached a seven-week high. The Canadian dollar gained 0.4
percent to C$1.0105 to the greenback and touched C$1.0084, the
strongest since Feb. 18.  “You can see your winners today are ones that normally
benefit” from central bank easing,  Fabian Eliasson , vice
president of corporate foreign-exchange sales at  Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. (8411)  in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“Are they going more into higher yield? Yes. Is it because of
an overall change in macro perspective? I’m not so sure.”  Sweden’s Krona  Sweden’s currency strengthened versus the euro and dollar
after a report showed consumer prices were unchanged on an
annualized basis in March, above the median of 12 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. The krona gained 0.4 percent to 8.3223 per
euro and climbed 0.7 percent to 6.3539 per dollar.  Colombia ’s peso fell to a one-week low on speculation the
government will announce measures next week that will lead to
further declines in the currency. President  Juan Manuel Santos 
will present a stimulus plan April 15 that includes additional
measures to stem gains in the peso, Finance Minister  Mauricio
Cardenas  said last week. The currency ended the day down 0.2
percent to 1,823.70 to the dollar after touching 1,827.30.  The yen has lost 13 percent this year versus nine
developed-nation counterparts monitored by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro has gained 0.9 percent,
and the dollar has advanced 1.6 percent.  Japanese investors were net sellers of foreign debt in the
week ended April 5, according to data released by the Ministry
of Finance today. They offloaded 1.14 trillion yen ($11.5
billion) in overseas bonds and notes, purchased 6.3 billion yen
in overseas stocks and bought 75.5 billion yen in overseas
short-term securities.  Inflation Goal  Haruhiko Kuroda said yesterday the unprecedented stimulus
announced on April 4 after his first meeting as BOJ governor is
enough to achieve a 2 percent inflation goal. The bank is
boosting monthly bond buying to 7.5 trillion yen ($80 billion),
suspending a cap on some bond holdings and dropping a limit on
debt maturities.  The central bank has taken all “necessary” and
“possible” measures, Kuroda told reporters in  Tokyo . While
officials will change policy as needed, he doesn’t expect
adjustments each month, he said. The BOJ chief reiterated a
pledge to do what’s needed to meet a 2 percent inflation target
in two years.  Europe ’s shared currency strengthened as Italy sold 4
billion euros of new 2.25 percent 2016 notes at 2.29 percent,
down from the 2.48 percent on similar-maturity debt allotted on
March 13, as investors shrugged off risks tied to the nation’s
political crisis.  ‘Cheap’ Euro  “The euro has been cheap versus the dollar,” said Michael Sneyd, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London . “Our
analysis shows it has been undervalued, relative to what has
been going on in Italian and Spanish bond markets.”  BNP Paribas forecasts the euro will rise to $1.35 within
three months, Sneyd said.  The  International Monetary Fund  said in a report today that
global central banks buying assets and keeping  interest rates 
low to boost growth have had “positive short-term effects for
banks” even as risks from the policies are increasing.  Central banks in the U.S., Europe,  Japan  and the U.K.
attacked the longest and deepest financial slump since the 1930s
with unorthodox accommodation.  The Fed spent $2.3 trillion from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds
of bond purchases to spur economic growth. It’s now buying $85
billion of debt a month. The Fed has kept its benchmark  interest
rate  at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to support the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
