Turkish benchmark yields fell to
the lowest in almost a month as the lira’s appreciation prompted
the central bank to increase the funds it provides to lenders.  Yields on two-year  benchmark bonds  declined 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage points, to 5.82 percent at the 5:00
p.m. close in Istanbul, the lowest level since March 12. The
lira sank 0.2 percent to 1.7872 a dollar in its first
depreciation in five days. The currency has advanced 1.1 percent
in the past month.  The central bank provided 2 billion liras ($1.1 billion),
twice as much as last week, in its one-week repurchase auction
today at the 5.50 percent benchmark interest rate. The funds
available to lenders increased to 16.3 billion liras today from
13.5 billion liras yesterday, according to central bank data.  “It seems that there is a change of stance by the central
bank because of the currency’s appreciation,” Erkin Isik, a
fixed-income strategist at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK) , wrote in e-
mailed comments. “The central bank has made the liquidity more
abundant.”  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee will convene
on April 16 to determine  interest rates .  Turkey  sold its longest-dated dollar bonds in two years
yesterday, raising $1.5 billion from 30-year notes at a yield of
4.95 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Turkey
received investor orders for about three times the amount sold
from 28 countries and is paying its lowest coupon ever for 30-
year dollar debt, the Treasury said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
