U.S. wheat stockpiles at the end of
the marketing year will be 2.1 percent higher than forecast last
month as livestock producers feed less to animals, the
Department of Agriculture said today in a report.  Inventories on May 31 will total 731 million bushels, the
USDA said, up from 716 million forecast last month. Analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  were expecting 730 million, on
average. About 360 million bushels will be fed to animals in the
U.S. during the current season, down from 375 million forecast
last month, the agency said. World stockpiles were also
projected to rise.  “The whole uptick in carryout is from the reduction in
feeding,” Ken Smithmier, a grains analyst at The Hightower
Report in  Chicago , which forecast stockpiles at 742 million
bushels, said in a telephone interview.  Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade have dropped 9
percent this year, partly on speculation that the U.S. crop will
be larger than the 2.269 billion bushels the government is
predicting, partly due to rain in the eastern Midwest. The May
contract was down 0.8 percent at $7.0825 a bushel at 7:19 a.m.
in Chicago.  Some livestock feeders have already switched back to corn
or are planning to after wheat’s price premium jumped to 79
cents on April 8 from a discount of 11 cents less than a month
earlier, Smithmier said. Many feedlots in parts of  Texas  and  New
Mexico  may resume buying corn if they can find supplies as
wheat’s premium increases, he said.  Global wheat stockpiles will total 182.26 million metric
tons by May 31, up from last month’s forecast of 178.23 million,
USDA data show. Analysts were expecting 178.82 million tons, on
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
