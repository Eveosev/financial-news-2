Corn  stockpiles  in the U.S., the
world’s top grower and exporter, will be 20 percent larger
before the next harvest than projected last month, the government
said. Analysts were expecting a bigger increase.  Inventories on Aug. 31 will be 757 million bushels (19.24
million metric tons), compared with 632 million forecast in
March and 989 million a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a  report . Analysts were expecting 836
million. Global inventories were also projected to rise. Futures
plunged 24 percent through yesterday since reaching a record in
August as the world supply outlook improved and high prices
slowed demand.  Smaller-than-expected gains in inventories may increase
costs for hog processor  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  and ethanol
producers such as Poet LLC and  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  About
41 percent of last year’s crop was processed into fuel, topping
the share used in animal feed for a second straight year.  “It’s a smaller increase than people expected and should
improve the interest from commercial buyers to increase
purchases,” Jim Gerlach, the president of A/C Trading Co. in
Fowler,  Indiana , said before the report. “All the attention now
shifts to weather forecasts and the pace of U.S. corn
planting.”  Corn Futures  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.1 percent to $6.4475 a
bushel at 7:39 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
reached a record $8.49 on Aug. 10 as the worst drought in more
than 70 years threatened production, eventually cutting the
harvest 13 percent to the lowest since 2006.  Exports will total 800 million bushels in the year ending
Aug. 31, down from 825 million forecast last month and the
lowest since 1972, the USDA said. Last year, 1.543 billion
bushels were shipped overseas.  Sales  in the current marketing
year through March 28 were 54 percent behind a year earlier,
USDA data shows.  An estimated 4.55 billion bushels will be used to produce
ethanol and an animal-feed byproduct, up from the March forecast
of 4.5 billion and down from 5.011 billion in the previous year,
the USDA said. Feed demand will total 4.4 billion bushels, down
from 4.55 billion projected a month ago and less than 4.545
billion a year earlier, the agency said.  Cash prices farmers receive in the current marketing year
will average $6.90 a bushel, compared with $7.10 estimated a
month ago and a record $6.22 last year.  World Output  Aggregate world  output  for the marketing years that began
Sept. 1 in the U.S. and March 1 in  Brazil  will be 855.92 million
tons, up from 854.07 million forecast a month ago and down from
882.5 million last year, the USDA said.  Brazil’s estimated crop was raised to 74 million from 72.5
million forecast in March and a record 73 million last year.
 Argentina ’s harvest was forecast at 26.5 million, unchanged from
a month ago while up from 21 million tons last season.  Global  consumption  is expected to fall to 862.51 million
tons from 878.81 million last year and 867.75 million forecast
in March.  Worldwide  inventories  will be 125.29 million tons, up from
117.48 million predicted a month ago, while down from 131.88
million a year earlier, the USDA said. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expected 120.41 million, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
