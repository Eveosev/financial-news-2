India ’s one-year  interest-rate
swaps  fell to a two-year low on speculation weak economic growth
will prompt the central bank to lower borrowing costs for a
third time in 2013. The rupee strengthened.  The cost to lock in rates for one year fell seven basis
points this month after a purchasing managers’ index released
April 1 showed manufacturing growth slowed to a 16-month low in
March.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao last cut
the  repurchase  rate by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent on March
19 and said the room for further easing was limited. The next
policy review is scheduled for May 3.  The one-year swap, a derivative contract used to guard
against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis point to
7.41 percent as of 9:25 a.m. in Mumbai, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The rate was the lowest since April 4, 2011.  “Growth continues to be a concern,” said Mahendra Jajoo,
who oversees $374 million of assets as chief investment officer
at Pramerica Asset Manager Pvt. in Mumbai. “Inflation is
expected to ease as global commodity prices have come down.” He
predicts the central bank will further cut the repurchase rate
by a maximum of 50 basis points this year.  Consumer price  gains slowed to 10.75 percent from a year
earlier in March from almost 11 percent in February, while
 wholesale  prices rose 6.3 percent, the least in 40 months,
according to separate Bloomberg surveys before data due this
week and next. Brent crude oil has retreated 12 percent from
this year’s high of 118.90 touched in February. Oil comprises
about 35 percent of India’s total imports.  ‘Expectation Management’  Industrial output shrank 1 percent in February, according
to a separate survey before a report due April 12.  Asia ’s third-
largest economy probably expanded 5 percent in the year ended
March 31, which would be the least since 2003, the  Central
Statistical Office  predicted in February.  “The RBI guidance has a lot to do with expectation
management,” said  Siddhartha Sanyal , the Mumbai-based chief
India economist at Barclays Plc. “But the actual situation
regarding growth is pretty weak and this will ultimately lead to
further softening.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds due June
2022 was little changed at 7.89 percent, according to the
central bank’s trading system.  The local currency strengthened on optimism unprecedented
monetary easing by  Japan  will boost inflows into emerging market
assets.  The rupee rose 0.2 percent to 54.4750 per dollar in Mumbai,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility in
the rupee, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used
to price options, fell seven basis points to 7.77 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.51 per
dollar, compared with 55.68 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
