Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s Hong Kong-
based head of equity derivatives and convertibles sales for  Asia 
Pacific, Min Park, is leaving the bank, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  The decision was announced this week, one of the people
said, asking not to be identified because the matter isn’t for
public disclosure. The people didn’t elaborate on the reasons
for Park’s departure. Queries sent to Park’s corporate e-mail
address weren’t immediately returned and a call to his office
was answered by his secretary who said he is no longer with the
company. Josephine Lee, a Hong Kong-based Credit Suisse
spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank said in February it is
seeking an additional 400 million Swiss francs ($429 million) in
cost savings by the end of 2015, on top of 4 billion francs in
planned cuts announced since 2011. The company said last month
it would eliminate 94 jobs at its main  New York  office beginning
April 1.  Credit Suisse is this year’s 16th-largest issuer of
structured notes globally excluding the U.S., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bank’s stock has risen 15.5 percent
this year.  Park joined Credit Suisse’s  Hong Kong  office in 2009 with
Ken Pang from UBS AG to oversee derivatives and convertible
sales, trading, risk management and infrastructure development
in Asia, the bank said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
