Combined U.S. soybean exports and
crushings will be 0.8 percent more than forecast a month ago,
the government said. Estimated inventories before this year’s
harvest were left unchanged because of bigger current supplies
than earlier forecast.  Stockpiles on Aug. 31 will total 125 million bushels
(3.39 million metric tons), down from 169 million a year
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
report. Inventories would be the smallest since 2004. The
average estimate of 35 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
was 138 million. Through yesterday, futures in  Chicago  fell
22 percent since reaching a record in September as South
America farmers planted more.  “It’s still a tight supply story until we get further
into the U.S. growing season,” Randy Mittelstaedt, the
director of research for R.J. O’Brien & Associates in
Chicago, said before the report. “Now the market will
watch the pace of domestic soybean-meal use and overseas
exports of the  animal feed  for signs of a slowdown in
demand and shift to South American supplies.”  In a quarterly report last month, the USDA estimated
inventories of the oilseed on March 1 totaled 999 million
bushels, 51 million bushels more than analysts were
expecting.  Bill Nelson , a senior economist for Doane
Advisory Services Co. in  St. Louis , said this was a sign
that last year’s harvest was bigger than the USDA’s
estimate of 3.015 billion bushels. Reserves were still the
lowest since 2004 and down 27 percent from a year earlier.  Soybean Futures  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$13.9475 bushel at 7:48 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Soybean meal for May delivery was little changed at $394.90
for 2,000 pounds. The high-protein animal feed dropped 5.9
percent this year through yesterday, after jumping 34
percent in 2012.  The  forecast  for U.S. exports in the marketing year
that began Sept. 1 was raised to 1.35 billion bushels, from
1.345 billion estimated in March.  About 1.635 billion bushels will be processed into
soybean meal and  soybean oil , up from 1.615 billion
estimated last month and down from 1.703 billion a year
earlier. Residual consumption of soybeans was forecast at 5
million bushels, compared with 30 million projected in
March and 1 million bushels a year earlier.  The average cash price farmers will receive in the
year that began Sept. 1 will be a record $14.30, unchanged
from a month ago and up from $12.50 last year, the USDA
said. The average price of soybean meal in Decatur,
 Illinois , was forecast at $425 for 2,000 pounds, down from
$435.00 forecast in March and $393.53 a year ago.  World Production  Aggregate world soybean production will total 269.63
million tons, more than the 268 million forecast in March,
the USDA said. In the previous year, output was 239.77
million tons.  Brazil , which began harvesting in February, is
projected to pass the U.S. as the top producer for the
first time. The country’s output was forecast at a record
83.5 million tons, unchanged from a month earlier and up
from 66.5 million a year ago. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expected 82.86 million, on average.  Argentina , the biggest shipper of soy-based animal
feed and vegetable oil, may harvest 51.5 million tons,
unchanged from last month and up from 40.1 million last
year, the USDA said. Analysts expected 50.58 million tons,
on average, after dry weather damaged crops earlier this
year.  Global  inventories  at the end of this marketing year
will be 62.63 million tons, up from 60.21 million forecast
in March, the USDA said. Analysts expected 60.1 million
tons, on average. A year earlier, supplies totaled 55.13
million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
