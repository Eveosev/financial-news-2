Norway’s underlying inflation slowed
less than estimated in May as transport and housing costs rose.  The  inflation  rate, adjusted for taxes and energy prices,
fell to 1.4 percent from 1.5 percent in April, Oslo-based
 Statistics Norway  said today. Prices were estimated to rise 1.1
percent, according to the median forecast of eight economists in
a Bloomberg survey. Underlying consumer prices rose 0.3 percent
in the month.  Policy makers at Norges Bank left the benchmark interest
rate unchanged at 1.5 percent last month and kept an outlook for
rates to rise in about a year from now. Policy makers said they
refrained from cutting rates again, in part as the krone had
weakened since a record in February.  “I think we can say for sure that an interest rate cut is
off the table,” Kari Due-Andresen, an economist at  Svenska
Handelsbanken AB (SHBA)  in Oslo, said by telephone. While we expect
Norges Bank “to lower the  interest rate  path, we don’t think it
will be a very large downward revision.”  The krone, which emerged as a haven for investors seeking
to evade  Europe ’s debt crisis, rose to a record on an import-weighted basis in February and has helped keep inflation below
the bank’s 2.5 percent target since 2009. The krone has slid 3.1
percent since the February record.  The headline inflation rate was 2 percent in the year and
consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
