Chile ’s peso dropped the most in
two months after Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said
intervention is a possibility after the currency rallied this
week to its strongest level since September 2011.  The peso depreciated 0.3% to 468.65 at the close in
Santiago, the steepest drop since Feb. 4. The currency finished
at 467.05 on April 8, its strongest in 19 months and approaching
the level where the central bank last intervened in January
2011.  Intervention is an option, and the Chilean government will
act in coordination with the central bank, Larrain told
reporters today in Santiago. Larrain is a non-voting member of
the central bank’s board, which is due to announce its monetary
policy rate decision tomorrow.  Larrain’s comments “are definitely hitting the exchange
rate,” Ronald Volpi, the head of spot currency trading at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA, said in a telephone
interview. “We’ve also noticed strong demand from a large bank
for dollars at these prices.”  Copper, which is Chile’s largest export, fell 0.6 percent
to $3.4195 a pound in New York after two days of gains. The
metal closed on April 3 at its lowest price in eight months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
