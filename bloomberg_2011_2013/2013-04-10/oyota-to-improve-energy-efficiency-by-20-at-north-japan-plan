Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest carmaker, aims to improve the energy efficiency at its
factory in  Japan ’s northern Tohoku region by about 20 percent.  The cut in energy use will be achieved with the F-grid, a
system to manage the energy use at the factory base in Ohira
city, Miyagi, President  Akio Toyoda  told reporters at the plant
today. It also targets reducing carbon dioxide emissions by
about 30 percent, he said.  Toyota, which makes a bigger percentage of its cars in
Japan compared with  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , is
improving its third domestic production base to become more
self-sufficient and cut risks of energy supply shortages.  “For investments in Japan, we want to look at things in
the long term,” Toyoda said.  Toyota built 45 percent of its vehicles in Japan last year,
compared with its two closest domestic rivals, which both built
about 30 percent of their vehicles in the country.  Shares of Toyota  rose  1.1 percent to 5,330 yen at the close
in Tokyo trading. They have gained 33 percent this year, helped
by the weaker yen.  -- Editors: Subramaniam Sharma, Chua Kong Ho  To contact the reporter on this story:
