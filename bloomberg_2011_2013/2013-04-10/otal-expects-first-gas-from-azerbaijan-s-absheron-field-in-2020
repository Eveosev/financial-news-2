Total SA (FP)  said it will produce the
first natural gas from the Absheron field in the Caspian in
2020, according to Christian Giudicelli, general manager of the
French company’s unit in Azerbaijan.  The deposit is expected to produce 3 billion to 5 billion
cubic meters of gas a year during the initial phase, Giudicelli
told reporters today in Baku, the Azeri capital.  Absheron, discovered in 2011, may contain 300 billion cubic
meters of gas and 45 million tons of condensate, or light oil,
according to an estimate by State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or
Socar.  Total and Socar each hold 40 percent of the project, while
 GDF Suez (GSZ)  has the remaining 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
