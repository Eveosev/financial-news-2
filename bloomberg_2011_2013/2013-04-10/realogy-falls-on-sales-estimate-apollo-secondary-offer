Realogy Holdings Corp. (RLGY) , the real
estate brokerage company backed by  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) ,
priced its secondary stock offering at $44 a share.  Realogy will offer 35 million shares held by Apollo, and
the underwriters may purchase an additional 5.25 million shares
within 30 days, Realogy, which owns the Century 21 and Coldwell
Banker brands, said in a statement today. The offering is due to
close on April 16.  Realogy closed at $44.27 in  New York  trading yesterday, the
lowest since Feb. 27, after announcing the secondary stock
offering and projecting sales below analysts’ estimates.  Apollo, the New York-based private-equity firm run by Leon Black, will own about 30.4 million shares after the sale if
underwriters don’t exercise their purchase option.  To contact the reporter on this story:
