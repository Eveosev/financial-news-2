Franco Biondi Santi, the patriarch
of Tuscan wine estate Il Greppo who played a leading role in
creating the reputation of Brunello di Montalcino wines, has
died at the age of 91, Wine Spectator said.  He was an advocate of traditional Brunellos, made from
100% Sangiovese grapes and aged for five years before release,
Wine Spectator said. He took over the property after his father
Tancredi died in 1970, and the family now owns about 62 acres
of vineyards, Wine Spectator reported.          Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
