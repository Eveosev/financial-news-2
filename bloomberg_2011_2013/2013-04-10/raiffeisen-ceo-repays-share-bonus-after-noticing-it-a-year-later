Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) ’s
chief executive officer repaid 2 million euros ($2.6 million) to
his company after saying he noticed that the lender’s annual
report would show his compensation swelled last year while he
cut jobs and profit fell.  Herbert Stepic told journalists in Vienna today that he
decided to redeem part of his share-based bonus out of
“solidarity” and respect for his employees amid job
reductions. He said he didn’t notice the share allocation until
he saw it disclosed in a draft copy of Raiffeisen’s annual
report he was proofreading ahead of publication today.  “The moment I saw the first draft of the annual report, I
realized that there is a significant number on display for me
personally,” Stepic said. After discussions with Chairman
Walter Rothensteiner, “we agreed that I make a repayment of 2
million euros,” he added.  Raiffeisen’s annual report details individual board
members’ salaries for the first time this year. The company
previously disclosed only a sum for the entire management board.
Stepic received 1.61 million euros in fixed salary in 2012,
along with 611,000 in bonuses for 2011 and 448,000 in “other”
remuneration.  Stepic also took possession of 86,217 Raiffeisen shares in
April 2012, part of a long-running share incentive program. The
value of the shares was 2.26 million euros at the time of the
award, according to the annual report. Stepic kept the shares
and repaid the 2 million euros in cash, company spokesman
Michael Palzer said.  Raiffeisen has cut more than 1,000 jobs in both Hungary and
 Romania  since 2008, and is moving jobs to lower-cost locations
in several countries. The bank received 1.75 billion euros in
state capital in 2009 and hasn’t announced a date to pay back
the funding. Profit dropped by 25 percent last year as loan
losses soared and the value of an acquisition in Ukraine was
written down.  ING Groep NV CEO Jan Hommen waived a 1.25 million-euro
bonus and a 2 percent pay rise in 2011 after a remuneration plan
sparked outrage among consumers and politicians and accelerated
new legislation for financial-services companies receiving aid
from the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
