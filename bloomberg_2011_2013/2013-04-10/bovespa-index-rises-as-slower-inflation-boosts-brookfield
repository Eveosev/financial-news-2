The Bovespa index rose to a two-
week high as homebuilder  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA (MRVE3)  led
gains by companies that sell locally amid speculation that
policy makers will keep borrowing costs at record lows.  Companies controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , including
port developer  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3)  and iron-ore producer  MMX
Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3)  were among the best performers on the
benchmark. Real estate brokerages  LPS Brasil Consultoria de
Imoveis SA  and  Brasil Brokers Participacoes (BBRK3)  gained after
Citigroup Inc. rated both stocks a buy in new coverage. Nine of
10 industry groups on the  MSCI Brazil index  advanced.  The Bovespa climbed 0.5 percent to 56,186.56 at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo, the highest since March 28. Forty-seven
 stocks  gained on the gauge while 22 dropped. The real rose 0.4
percent to 1.9728 per dollar. Brazilian swap rates on contracts
due in January 2017 fell 0.03 percentage point to 9.11 percent
after data released by the national statistics agency showed
inflation slowed more than forecast last month.  “Inflation figures came in lower than expected, which is
good for equities, as it may give some room for the central bank
to postpone interest-rate increases,”  Pedro Galdi , the chief
strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora, said in a
telephone interview.  Consumer prices in Brazil as measured by the  IPCA index 
rose 0.47 percent in March after climbing 0.60 percent in the
prior month, the national statistics agency reported today. The
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
0.50 percent increase. Annual inflation accelerated to 6.59
percent, exceeding the 6.50 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s target range for the first time since November 2011.  Rate Outlook  Minutes of the central bank’s March 5-6 meeting indicated
that an increase in the benchmark lending rate from a record low
7.25 percent wasn’t imminent as policy makers said “a cautious
management of monetary policy” was needed. Board members are
next scheduled to set rates on April 16-17.  Brasil Brokers gained 1.9 percent to 6.83 reais, and LPS
advanced 2.6 percent to 17.54 reais.  “These companies offer exposure to the Brazilian emerging
middle class at a lower valuation than most,” Citigroup
analysts Paola Mello and Dan McGoey wrote in a research note
dated yesterday. “They serve the entire homebuilding industry,
including the non-listed builders, which are in better shape
than many of the well-known listed ones.”  Brasil Brokers trades at 13.4 times its forecast 2013
earnings, while LPS trades at a ratio of 14.8, below the average
in the last three years of approximately 17.5 times, according
to Citigroup’s analysts.  Bovespa Valuation  LLX gained 9.7 percent to 2.26 reais. MMX advanced 2.5
percent to 2.06 reais. MRV jumped 7.6 percent to 9.78 reais.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  has retreated 11 percent from this year’s high
on Jan. 3 amid concern accelerating inflation may curb Brazil’s
economic recovery and the government’s interventionist policies
will hurt profits in industries including utilities and energy.
The  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC)  of shares in Brazil,  Russia ,  India  and China
has lost 6.7 percent over the same period.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 11.4 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.5 for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 9.27 billion
reais today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.43 billion reais this year
through April 8, according to data compiled by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
