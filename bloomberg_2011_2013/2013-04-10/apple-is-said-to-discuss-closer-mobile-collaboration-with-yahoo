Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Yahoo! Inc (YHOO)  (YHOO). executives have discussed ways to collaborate more closely on mobile software, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer has met with Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet services, to explore ways Yahoo can be more deeply integrated into the software that runs on the iPhone and iPad, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The Wall Street Journal previously reported the discussions.  Mayer has made weaving Yahoo services into mobile devices a central part of her turnaround strategy for the biggest U.S. Web portal. Mayer said in January she’s seeking to work alongside companies such as Apple, Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. to broaden Yahoo’s reach.  Yahoo provides data for Apple’s weather and stocks applications. The companies forged closer ties last year when Yahoo’s sports information was integrated with Apple’s Siri voice-recognition software.  Yahoo (YHOO)  rose 1.3 percent to $24.13 at 11:08 a.m. in New York.  Apple (AAPL)  gained 1.3 percent to $432.48.  The talks may not lead to a deal. Apple often talks with other companies about ways to incorporate data or services into its products, the person said.
