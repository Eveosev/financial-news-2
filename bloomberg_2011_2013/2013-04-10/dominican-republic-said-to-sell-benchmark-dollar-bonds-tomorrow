The  Dominican Republic  plans to
sell dollar bonds due in 10 years as soon as tomorrow, according
to a person familiar with the offering.  Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG are arranging the
benchmark transaction, said the person who asked not to be
identified because final terms aren’t set. Benchmark sales are
typically at least $500 million.  The Caribbean nation is joining countries from  Mexico  to
 Indonesia  to sell debt abroad this week and take advantage of a
drop in borrowing costs. The extra yield investors demand to own
Dominican bonds fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 394 points at 11 a.m. in New York, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co’s EMBIG indexes.  The Dominican Republic hasn’t tapped the international debt
markets since 2011, when it raised $750 million. The yield on
the country’s securities due in 2021 have dropped 1.54
percentage points in the last year to 5.47 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds from the bond sale will be used to finance
infrastructure projects and for other purposes, according to the
person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
