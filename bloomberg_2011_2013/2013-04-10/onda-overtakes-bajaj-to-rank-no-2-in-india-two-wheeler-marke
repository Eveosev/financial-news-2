Honda Motor Co. (7267) , the world’s
biggest motorcycle maker, overtook  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT)  as  India ’s
second biggest two-wheeler seller after rising demand for its
scooters and motorbikes helped Honda outpace the industry.  Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Pvt. sold 2.61 million
units in the 12 months ended March 31, an increase of 31 percent
from a year earlier, as the company added new models and
dealerships. In contrast, Bajaj’s sales fell 4 percent to 2.46
million units in the same period, according to data from the
 Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers .  Honda seeks to quadruple motorbike and scooter sales in
India by 2020 and overtake former partner  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) ,
banking on a lack of public transportation in rural areas of the
country of 1.24 billion people. The Tokyo-based company has
risen from fourth place in 2011, even as competition intensifies
with Hero, Bajaj and  Yamaha Motor Co. (7272)  rolling out new models to
attract buyers.  The motorcycle maker plans to introduce a two-wheeler model
every three months and expand its dealerships to reach about 10
million in sales, or a third of the 30 million-unit market by
2020, Tatsuhiro Oyama, senior managing officer in charge of
motorcycle operations, said in February.  Honda, which ended a 26-year-old joint venture with Hero in
2010, had about 19 percent of the Indian two-wheeler market last
year, and overtook Chennai-based  TVS Motor Co. (TVSL)  in the previous
fiscal year. Hero is India’s biggest motorcycle maker with a 43
percent share of the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
