West Texas Intermediate crude
declined after an American Petroleum Institute report showed
U.S. stockpiles surged to the highest level since July 1981.  Prices fell as much as 0.8 percent after the industry-
funded API said supplies rose 5.06 million barrels last week.
Government data today may show inventories advanced 1.5 million
barrels, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Refineries
ran at 87.7 percent of capacity, the most since January, API
said. Gasoline futures tumbled as much as 1.4 percent.  Oil
prices  pared losses as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index reached
an intraday record.  “The fundamentals are becoming more and more bearish,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price Futures
Group in  Chicago . “The combination of plentiful crude supplies
and strong refinery activity is especially bearish for
gasoline.”  WTI crude for May delivery slipped 28 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $93.92 a barrel at 9:45 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The volume of all futures traded was 19
percent less than the 100-day average for the time of day.  Gasoline for May delivery dropped 3.24 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.91 a gallon on the Nymex. Volume was 35 percent
above the 100-day average.  The  S&P 500  advanced as much as 0.5 percent to 1,576.10,
topping the intraday record set in October 2007.  Brent oil for May settlement declined 42 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $105.81 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The volume of all Brent futures was 13 percent
lower than the 100-day average.  The European benchmark was at a premium of $11.89 to WTI,
down from $12.03 at yesterday’s close. The premium settled at
$11.30 on April 8, the narrowest level since June 22.  Gasoline Supply  U.S. gasoline supplies increased by 1.96 million barrels
last week, the API said in the report released yesterday in
 Washington . They are forecast to fall  1.5 million barrels  in the
Energy Information Administration report scheduled for 10:30
a.m. in Washington, according to the median estimate of 11
analysts in the Bloomberg survey.  Inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, slid 1.26 million barrels in the API
report, compared with a projected 1.5 million-barrel decline in
the EIA report.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical unit, for its weekly survey.  FOMC Statement  Futures dropped to the intraday low after minutes of the
 Federal Open Market Committee ’s March meeting indicated some
members called for the Fed to begin tapering its bond-buying
program this year.  Several members of the FOMC “thought that if the outlook
for labor market conditions improved as anticipated, it would
probably be appropriate to slow purchases later in the year and
to stop them by year-end,” according to the record of the Fed
meeting released today at 9 a.m. in Washington.  The central bank published the minutes five hours before
the scheduled time after they were mistakenly sent to some
people yesterday afternoon.  China, the world’s second-biggest oil-consuming country,
reported that net daily imports fell to the lowest level in six
months in March.  China  bought 22.78 million metric tons of crude
more than it exported, according to figures on the Beijing-based
General Administration of Customs’s website today. That’s
equivalent to net imports of 5.39 million barrels a day, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
