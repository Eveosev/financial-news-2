Treasuries declined a third day
after minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting showed several
members said the central bank should begin tapering its bond-
buying program later this year and stop it by year-end.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes rose as the U.S.
government prepared to auction $21 billion of the debt today
followed by $13 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow. Yields
remained higher as Bank of  Japan  Governor  Haruhiko Kuroda 
reiterated that the central bank will take all steps necessary
to meet a 2 percent inflation target even as he indicated policy
adjustments are unlikely every month.  It’s “as much talk being focused on tapering and ending
quantitative easing earlier than expected,” said Dan Mulholland, head of U.S. Treasury trading in the capital-markets
unit of BNY Mellon Corp. in New York. “The Treasury market is a
little bit lower.”  The 10-year yield rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.79 percent at 12:17 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note
due February 2023 fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount,
to 101 29/32. The yield dropped to 1.68 percent on April 5, the
lowest level since Dec. 12.  The Fed released the minutes of its March 19-20 meeting
ahead of the previously scheduled time after they were
inadvertently sent to some individuals yesterday afternoon. The
individuals on the distribution list were primarily
congressional employees and employees of trade organizations,
the central bank said in a statement.  Previous Auction  The 10-year securities being auctioned today yielded 1.79
percent in pre-auction trading. The notes were sold at a yield
of 2.029 percent at the previous auction on March 13, versus
2.046 percent on Feb. 13.  Investors bid for 3.19 times the amount of available debt
last month, the highest  bid-to-cover  ratio since October.
Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks, bought
47.7 percent of the securities, the most since December 2011.  “The risk at the auction is Japanese investors may use the
liquidity event to add 10-year Treasuries exposure,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It’s not clear to me it’s a foregone
conclusion, but that’s been highlighted as a key risk ahead of
this afternoon’s auction.”  FOMC Outlook  The central bank currently buys $85 billion of Treasury and
mortgage debt a month in its so-called quantitative easing
program to spur the economy by putting downward pressure on
borrowing costs.  Members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  “thought that
if the outlook for labor market conditions improved as
anticipated, it would probably be appropriate to slow purchases
later in the year and to stop them by year-end,” according to
the record of the FOMC’s March 19-20 meeting released today in
 Washington .  Payrolls grew by 88,000 workers last month, the least in
nine months, even as the  unemployment rate  declined, the Labor
Department said April 5. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey
had forecast a rise of 190,000.  “The meeting minutes, from our perspective, didn’t really
mean a whole lot because of that 88,000 print,” said
Mitchell Stapley, the  Grand Rapids , Michigan-based chief fixed-
income officer for Fifth Third Asset Management, which oversees
$15 billion in assets. “All that number did on Friday was to
confirm the $85 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage-backed
purchases is going to go on.”  The economy added an average of 179,000 people a month to
nonfarm payrolls in 2011 and 2012, Labor Department data show.
The  jobless rate  had stayed above 8 percent since February 2009
until it broke the trend in September.  Yield Rise  The benchmark 10-year yield will rise to 2.3 percent by
year-end, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists with the
most recent projections given the heaviest weightings.  U.S. securities fell along with German bunds and U.K. gilts
as speculation waned that Japanese investors will buy them after
the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said it would boost monthly bond purchases to
an unprecedented 7.5 trillion yen ($75.4 billion) a month.  German 10-year bund yields rose four basis points to 1.30
percent and the yield on similar-maturity gilts also added four
basis points, to 1.78 percent.  “The notion is the head of the Bank of Japan has said the
bank has done what’s possible for now, suggesting its current
policy stance is going to be in place,” Lyngen of CRT said.  “The biggest commitment is that we will take all necessary
measures,” Kuroda said at a press gathering in  Tokyo  today, six
days after announcing unprecedented stimulus to double the
monetary base over two years. Markets are still adjusting to the
policies, he added, after swings in bond yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
