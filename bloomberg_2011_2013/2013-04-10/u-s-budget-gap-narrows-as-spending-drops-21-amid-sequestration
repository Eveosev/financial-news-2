(Corrects prior month comparison in second paragraph.)  The U.S.  budget deficit  narrowed in
March from a year earlier as spending shrank almost 21 percent
during the first month of mandatory federal cutbacks known as
sequestration.  The shortfall totaled $106.5 billion after a $198.2 billion
gap in March 2012, the Treasury Department said today in
 Washington . Economists projected a $107 billion deficit,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  President  Barack Obama  laid out his $3.8 trillion budget
proposal for fiscal 2014 today as lawmakers and the
administration battled to agree on deficit cuts and ways to
replace across-the-board, automatic spending cuts that took
effect March 1. Republicans proposed cutting spending to
eliminate the deficit by 2023 while the Obama administration
said spending cuts must be accompanied by further revenue
increases such as the elimination of tax loopholes.  “The mountains of red ink coming out of Washington are
less so as we look forward and you can thank those hard-nosed
mandatory spending cuts for that,”  Chris Rupkey , chief
financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  New
York , said before the report was released.  Today’s report showed revenue rose 8.6 percent in March
from the same month a year earlier, to $186 billion. Spending
decreased 20.8 percent to $292.5 billion, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
