California  should lower the vote
threshold for approving new roads, highways and transportation
projects to a majority from two-thirds, Los Angeles Mayor
 Antonio Villaraigosa  said in his final state-of-the-city speech.  Villaraigosa, who has led the second most-populous U.S.
metropolis since 2005, said such a change would need an
amendment to the state Constitution, which requires a
supermajority to pass special taxes and a simple majority for
general local taxes.  “For too long, a small minority has been able to cast a
veto on our collective future,” said Villaraigosa, 60, a
Democrat who leaves office June 30 because of term limits.
Cities risk losing federal matching funds when voters reject
transportation taxes, he said in the speech yesterday.  From 2001 to November, 58 local special taxes for
transportation have fallen short of the two-thirds threshold for
passage, while 37 passed, according to  data  compiled by  Michael
Coleman , a fiscal adviser to California municipalities.  In 2000, California voters agreed to  lower  the minimum for
certain school-bond measures to 55 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
