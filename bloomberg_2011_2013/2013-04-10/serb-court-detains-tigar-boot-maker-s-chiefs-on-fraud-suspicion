Three senior managers at Serbian
boot maker Tigar AD were arrested by police and detained on
suspicion of abuse of office, a Higher Court judge said.  “There is a grounded suspicion that Dragan Nikolic,
Milivoje Nikolic and Jelena Petkovic committed” a crime over an
“extended period of time between the start of 2008 and the end
of 2012,” Judge Zoran Kolev told Bloomberg by phone from the
town of Pirot, in southeast Serbia where the rubber plant is
located. “I have ordered a detention period of up to 30 days.”  The three are suspected of having “inflicted gross damage
to Tigar worth 395 million dinars ($4.61 million),” Kolev said.  Nikolic is Tigar’s general manager, Nikolic the executive
manager for human resources and Petkovic the company’s executive
director for corporate management. Their lawyer, Dejan
Dobrosavljevic, said by phone there was no reason for their
detention before a trial where “I am confident they will be
found innocent.”  The company’s shares last traded April 8 at 200 dinars on
the Belgrade Stock Exchange, almost 20 percent above a three-
year low of 167 dinars and about a quarter of its value three
years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
