Bank of England policy maker David Miles said more stimulus to bolster the economy is the right policy even with inflation above the central bank’s target.  “We’re in a difficult situation where growth has been extremely low, and the outlook is not for a rapid pickup,” Miles said in an interview on Sky News television in  London  yesterday. “It’s right that monetary policy should be very expansionary” because prospects for the U.K. are “troubling.”  Miles, along with Paul Fisher and Governor Mervyn King, voted to increase bond purchases by 25 billion pounds ($38 billion) in March, though were defeated by the remaining six members of the Monetary Policy Committee, who voted for no change. The MPC majority said there was a risk of adding to stimulus at a time when the  inflation rate  remains above the BOE’s 2 percent goal.  The MPC also kept its bond-purchase target unchanged this month, at 375 billion pounds. The minutes of that meeting will be published on April l7, a day after March inflation data. Consumer-price growth accelerated to 2.8 percent in February.  Miles said while inflation is “uncomfortably above” the BOE’s goal, it’s “heading in the right direction.” He expects inflation to slow toward the target and said that more stimulus is the “right strategy” for Britain’s economy.  QE Impact  In the interview, the policy maker also said while the mechanism by which  quantitative easing  works is the same as when the program started in 2009, it’s “a bit difficult to judge” whether it is having the same impact on the economy.  Asked about the Bank of England’s report last month that U.K. banks need to raise more capital to protect themselves against potential shocks, he said it was wrong to think tougher capital rules curb lending.  “There’s a view you hear quite often -- many senior bankers espouse the view -- that having banks use more equity capital is somehow detrimental to lending,” he said. “That makes very little economic sense. When a bank is asked to use more equity funding, other things equal, it’s got more money to lend and not less. It’s almost exactly the opposite of the impression that many people seem to give.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Fergal O’Brien in London at  fobrien@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at  cstirling1@bloomberg.net
