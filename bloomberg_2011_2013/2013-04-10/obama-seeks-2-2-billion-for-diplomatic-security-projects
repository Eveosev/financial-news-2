The Obama administration proposed
$2.2 billion in the year starting Oct. 1 for building projects
to improve security at diplomatic facilities following last
year’s attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.  The funding is part of a $4.4 billion budget request for
security staff, construction and infrastructure upgrades in
fiscal 2014, a $996 million increase from fiscal 2012.  The security request follows the Sept. 11 assault in
Benghazi that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans.  The $3.8 trillion budget proposal sent by President  Barack Obama  to Congress today would also cut economic support to
 Afghanistan  and  Pakistan  to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2014, a $1.7
billion reduction from 2012 levels.  It would eliminate funding for the Pakistan
Counterinsurgency Capability Fund, which provided training,
helicopters and other equipment for Pakistani special operations
forces fighting militants in tribal regions. The cut reflects
growing demands elsewhere in the world rather than frustration
with Pakistan, according to a State Department  official who
briefed reporters on condition of not being identified.  The budget allocates $580 million for economic development
in Middle East countries making the transition to democracy.  “These funds are a strategic investment in our core
mission of advancing America’s national security and economic
interests,” Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.  Altogether, the White House proposed a $47.8 billion budget
in fiscal 2014 for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for
International Development, a 6 percent reduction from fiscal
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
