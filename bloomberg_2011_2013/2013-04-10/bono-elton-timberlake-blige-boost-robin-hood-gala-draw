Elton John, Bono and Grammy-winning
singer Mary J. Blige will be featured performers at the  Robin
Hood Foundation ’s 25th anniversary gala next month.  The May 13 event, which raises money for  New York ’s
poverty-fighting organizations, will have actress Jessica Biel
and her husband,  Justin Timberlake , serving as co-chairmen,
according to an invitation mailed to donors and companies this
week.  The couple will share the spotlight at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center with fellow co-chairmen KKR & Co. Co-Chairman
Henry Kravis and his wife, Marie Josee; CBS Corp. Chief
Executive Officer Les Moonves and his wife, Julie Chen; and
Sonia and Paul Tudor Jones II, Robin Hood’s co-founder.  “The evening is going to highlight the groundwork our
grantees have done over the past quarter century that will help
us improve the lives of New York City children over the next 25
years,” Robin Hood spokeswoman Patty Smith said in an e-mail.  Since its start in 1988, Robin Hood’s annual gala has
become the largest single-night annual fundraising event for a
nonprofit in New York. The party raised $59.2 million last year,
$47.4 million in 2011 and $87.8 million in 2010 with the help of
a big donation from Open Society Institute Founder  George Soros .  The organization has raised and distributed more than $1.25
billion in its history. Robin Hood announced this week that it
has given out all the $70.5 million it raised for  Hurricane
Sandy  relief.  (A limited number of tickets are available for the May 13
gala at $3,000 for individuals, and $30,000 to $250,000 for
