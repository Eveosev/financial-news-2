West Texas Intermediate crude rose
for a third day as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced to
an intraday record, bolstering speculation that fuel consumption
will climb. Brent oil’s premium to  New York  futures shrank to
the smallest level since June.  Futures increased 0.5 percent as the  S&P 500  gained after
Chinese imports grew,  Japan  reiterated its stimulus plans and on
speculation earnings will beat estimates. Oil fell earlier when
the Energy Information Administration said  supplies  grew 250,000
barrels to 388.9 million last week, the most since July 1990.
The jump was less than the 1.5 million barrels forecast by
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “A gain in the S&P is seen as an indication of a rising
GDP and in turn increasing fuel demand,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. ‘  WTI crude for May delivery rose 44 cents to $94.64 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since April 2. The volume of all futures traded was 8.8 percent
less than the 100-day average for the time of day at 3:45 p.m.  Brent oil for May settlement declined 44 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $105.79 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The volume of all Brent
futures was 0.3 percent above than the 100-day average.  The European benchmark was at a premium of $11.15 to WTI
down from $12.03 at yesterrday’s close and the narrowest level
since June 21 based on settlement prices.  Equity Rally  The S&P 500 gained as much as 1.3 percent, topping the
previous high set in October 2007. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  climbed as much as 1 percent.  Chinese imports rose 14.1 percent in March from the year
earlier, leaving the nation with an unexpected trade deficit.
 Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said today that the
unprecedented stimulus announced by the BOJ at his first meeting
as governor last week is enough to achieve a 2 percent inflation
goal and stimulate the economy.  “Any strength we’re seeing in oil today is coming from the
equity market,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital
LLC, a New York energy hedge fund. “The inventory report was
neutral to bearish. Inventories are extraordinarily high, even
if the gain was smaller than we expected.”  U.S. Output  Crude production  rose 30,000 barrels to 7.18 million, the
highest level since July 1992, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical unit. Output has surged as the
combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale formations in
the central U.S.  Stockpiles of crude at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub
increased 889,000 barrels to 50.1 million last week, according
to the EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.  “Inventories are at historically high levels, which are
hard to ignore,” said Adam Wise, who helps manage a $6 billion
oil and gas bond portfolio as a managing director at Manulife
Asset Management in  Boston . “The fundamentals are putting
downward pressure on prices, but the market remains resilient.”  Refineries operated  at 86.8 percent of capacity, up 0.5
percentage point from the seven days ended March 29. Units are
often restarted in the spring after being idled for maintenance
in late winter as attention shifts away from heating oil and
before the summer when gasoline consumption peaks.  Gasoline Inventories  Stockpiles of  gasoline  increased 1.7 million barrels to
222.4 million, according to the EIA. It was the first gain in
two months.  Gasoline for May delivery tumbled 7.73 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at $2.8651 a gallon on the Nymex. Volume was
92 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  “Gasoline inventories are back at comfortable levels after
this report,” Kilduff said. “Gasoline is the seasonal leader
and should keep a lid on things.”  OPEC trimmed its estimate for global oil demand growth this
year in a report today. Consumption will rise by 800,000 barrels
a day, or 0.9 percent, this year, revised down from 840,000 last
month, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said in
its Monthly Oil Market Report. Demand will increase to 89.66
million barrels a day in 2013 versus 88.87 million last year,
the 12-member group projected.  $100 Barrel  Crude will trade in Europe at about $100 a barrel this year
as demand on the continent continues to decline, said Ibrahim al-Muhanna, an adviser to  Saudi Arabia ’s oil minister. Markets
will be balanced in 2013 as  China  leads nations where demand is
increasing, Muhanna said at a meeting of the  Organization of
Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries  in  Kuwait  today.  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said March 18 that
oil at $100 a barrel is a “reasonable” price that won’t choke
global economic growth.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in June was 19 percent, down from 19.2 percent
yesterday. The figure has slipped from 24.7 percent on Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 413,931
contracts as of 3:45 p.m. It totaled 577,232 contracts
yesterday, 0.4 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was a record 1.77 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
