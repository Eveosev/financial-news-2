Sydney needs a six-star hotel and
must attract more high-roller gamblers as it considers two
competing casino proposals, New South  Wales  state Premier Barry
O’Farrell said.  Echo Entertainment Group Ltd. (EGP) , which runs Sydney’s only
casino, yesterday sought to extend its exclusive license,
potentially blocking a rival resort that billionaire  James Packer ’s  Crown Ltd. (CWN)  wants to build on the city’s harbor.  “The high-roller gaming market in the Asia-Pacific region
is worth a lot of money and if Echo want to get into it more, if
Crown want to get into it more, that is fantastic for New South
Wales,” O’Farrell said at the Bloomberg Australia Economic
Summit in Sydney today.  New South Wales will approve only one of the two proposals,
according to a statement from O’Farrell’s office yesterday. They
would be comprehensively reviewed with assessment reports
expected by the end of May, O’Farrell said.  Crown, which owns 10 percent of Echo, wants to build a A$1
billion ($1 billion) hotel and casino targeting high-rolling
Asian gamblers at the Barangaroo development site just west of
Sydney’s main business district.  “Don’t be surprised if it is a choice between backing
economic growth -- whether it is the tourism sector or other
things -- I will always stand behind it,” O’Farrell said during
the summit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
