Servico Municipal de Saneamento
Ambiental de Santo Andre, a Brazilian water utility, will start
building a 80.7 million-real ($41 million) water-treatment plant
in the Sao Paulo suburb of Santo Andre.  Semasa, as the company is known, has been approved for a
loan for most of the project costs by Fundo de Investimento do
Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Servico, the state-run severance
and disability fund, according to a Semasa spokeswoman who
didnâ€™t want to be named because of company policy.  The plant will take two years to build, with construction
due to begin in October. The facility will boost the amount of
water produced locally to 25 percent from 5 percent, reducing
imports from  Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
