Taiwan’s government bonds fell,
with the  five-year  yield rising the most in more than a week, on
speculation political tensions on the Korean peninsula will ease
once a possible missile test is completed.  Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense is using various
devices, including radar, to monitor developments on the
peninsula, spokesman David Lo said yesterday. South Korea’s
 Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares advanced for a second day as 11 of 20
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast the central bank will
reduce borrowing costs tomorrow to 2.5 percent from 2.75 percent.  “The international community is very nervous about North
Korea’s missile threat, but South Korea seems pretty calm,”
said Tobby Lin, a fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co.
in Taipei. “Traders are also clearing their positions before
South Korea’s rate meeting tomorrow.”  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.975 percent in
Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.998
against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The
central bank has sold the local currency in the run-up to the
close on most days in the past year, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.3 percent to
NT$29.945, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts
touched NT$30.10 yesterday, the weakest level since July 27.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped 17 basis points to 4.27 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was little changed at
0.385 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
