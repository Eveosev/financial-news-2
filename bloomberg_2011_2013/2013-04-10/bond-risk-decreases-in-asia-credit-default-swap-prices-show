 The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Asia against non-payment fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  declined 1 basis point to 116 basis
points as of 8:10 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is poised for its lowest close
since March 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 0.5 of a basis
point to 91.5 as of 9:13 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The benchmark is headed for its lowest close since
Nov. 22, 2010, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at
114.5 as of 10:09 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The measure has ranged from 102.3 basis points and
127.5 basis points this year, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
