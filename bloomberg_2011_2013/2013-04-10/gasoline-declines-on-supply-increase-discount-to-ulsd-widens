Gasoline fell, crack spreads
narrowed and the motor fuel’s discount to ultra-low-sulfur
diesel widened after a report that gasoline supplies increased
last week.  Futures weakened after the industry-funded  American
Petroleum Institute  reported yesterday that  gasoline stockpiles 
rose 1.96 million barrels. The median of 11 analyst estimates
projected that the Energy Information Administration will report
today that inventories fell 1.5 million barrels.  “The market was surprised by the build in gasoline stocks
reported by the API and will await confirmation this morning
from the EIA,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 3.27 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $2.9097 a gallon at 9:42 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Trading volume was 34 percent above the 100-day
average.  The API reported inventories in the U.S. East Coast, or
PADD 1 region, which includes New York Harbor, the delivery
point for Nymex futures, increased 2.16 million barrels.  The motor fuel was the worst performer today on the
Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index  of 24 commodities.  Gasoline’s discount to ULSD widened 3.05 cents to 4.94
cents a gallon, after narrowing the prior four days.  Crack Spreads  The May  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
on Nymex fell $1.10 to $28.28 a barrel. The  spread  against Brent
oil on ICE Futures Europe Exchange slipped 97 cents to $16.38.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 1.1 cents
to $3.572 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
fallen 21.4 cents from the year-to-date high of $3.786 on Feb.
26 and are 35 cents below a year earlier.  The EIA is scheduled to report last week’s inventories at
10:30 a.m. in  Washington . The report will probably say that
distillate supplies fell 1.5 million barrels, according to the
survey. The API reported a decline of 1.26 million barrels.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery fell 0.22 cent to
$2.9591 a gallon on volume that was 27 percent below the 100-day
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
