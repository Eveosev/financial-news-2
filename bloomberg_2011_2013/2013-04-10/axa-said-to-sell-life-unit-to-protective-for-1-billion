Axa SA (CS) , Europe’s second-largest
insurer, agreed to sell a U.S. unit and transfer certain
obligations to  Protective Life Corp. (PL)  for $1.06 billion,
according to two people with knowledge of the deal.  Axa is selling Mony  Life Insurance  Co. to Birmingham,
Alabama-based Protective, which will reinsure some life
policies, said the people, who requested anonymity because the
deal hasn’t been announced. Axa will still offer life insurance
and retirement products in the U.S. and the agreement doesn’t
include the Mony distribution network, the people said.  Axa, led by Chief Executive Officer Henri De Castries, had
been seeking a deal to sell some U.S. life obligations to free
capital. The Paris-based company has sought to expand in Asia
and other emerging markets as a slow European economy and low
bond yields weigh on profits.  Cigna Corp. reached a $2.2 billion deal with  Warren
Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in February to cut liabilities
tied to death benefits. Sun Life Financial Inc. agreed to sell
its U.S. annuity business in a $1.35 billion deal in December as
CEO Dean Connor worked to reduce risk.  Christina Anderson, a spokeswoman for Protective, didn’t
immediately respond to requests for comment. Discretion Winter,
an Axa spokeswoman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
