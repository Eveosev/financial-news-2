Liverpool midfielder  Lucas Leiva 
signed a new “long-term” contract, the Premier League soccer
club said on its website.  Lucas, 26, has scored six goals in 208 appearances since
joining Liverpool from Gremio in his native  Brazil  in 2007.  “It’s where I think I belong and where I wanted to stay,”
he said. “It was not a difficult decision to make and I am
really looking forward to what will hopefully be a few more
years with a lot of success.”  Lucas has played just 20 Premier League games this season
after being sidelined from August to December by a thigh injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
