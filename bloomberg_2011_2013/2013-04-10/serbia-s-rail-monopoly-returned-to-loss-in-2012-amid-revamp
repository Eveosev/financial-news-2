Zeleznice Srbije,  Serbia ’s state-
owned rail monopoly, said it returned to a loss last year amid
preparations for restructuring and deregulation.  The company posted a net loss of 16.5 billion dinars ($193
million) as operating revenue fell 2.4 percent to 26.4 billion
dinars while costs increased 26 percent to 39.1 billion dinars,
Chief Financial Officer Rajko Kovic told reporters in Belgrade
today. An operating loss of 12.7 billion dinars was compounded
by 3.8 billion dinars in deferred taxes, he said.  The Belgrade-based company recorded a 12.7 billion-dinar
profit in 2011 when it had an “extraordinary writedown” of
liabilities by the state, Kovic said. A year earlier, its loss
was 17.4 billion dinars.  Zeleznice stands to receive 14.6 billion dinars in
subsidies this year compared with state support of 14.9 billion
dinars in 2012, he said.  Serbia’s parliament will start debating a draft law on rail
services next week which is aimed at improving services to
European Union standards, Chief Executive Office Dragoljub
Simonovic said. The company may be split into four units that
will separately handle passenger traffic, cargo, infrastructure
and asset-management, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
