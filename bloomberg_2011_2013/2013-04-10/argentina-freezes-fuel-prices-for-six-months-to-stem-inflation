Argentina froze the price of
gasoline and diesel sold at service stations for six months in a
bid to stem annual inflation as high as 25 percent.  Price caps were set for six areas covering the whole
country in a resolution by Internal Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno published in the official gazette today.  The fuel price restrictions follow agreements with
supermarkets to freeze prices at least until June 1 as President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  struggles with surging consumer
prices before congressional elections in October. An independent
inflation gauge published by opposition lawmakers estimated
prices rose 25 percent in the year through Feb. 28, compared
with a 10.8 percent rate reported by the government’s statistics
agency for the same span.  “It’s absolutely necessary to dictate policies to
determine the price of liquid fuels in order to avoid
inconsistencies in the price paid by consumers,” Moreno said in
the resolution.  YPF SA (YPFD) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Bridas Corp.’s Axion Energy
and Petroleo Brasileiro SA are the largest refiners in
Argentina.  Petrobras and Shell declined to comment. YPF said in an e-
mailed statement that the measures won’t affect its business
plan. Axion didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
