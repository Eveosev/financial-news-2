Amiad Water Systems Ltd. (AFS) , an
Israel-based water treatment and filtration producer that trades
in London, said revenue rose 12 percent from a year earlier,
buoyed by specialized membrane contracts in  Australia .  The AIM-listed company founded more than a half-century ago
at a kibbutz reported today in a statement that full-year sales
increased to $131.1 million on growth of its municipal and
irrigation operations as well as ballast water revenue.  Helping drive the growth were contracts in Australia for
seawater reverse-osmosis membrane protection and pre-filtration
membrane protection in oil and gas, it said. Amiad shares have
risen 19 percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
