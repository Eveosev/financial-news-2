German stocks  advanced the most in
a month after a report showed that China’s imports in March
increased more than estimated and as U.S. stocks jumped to a
record signaling demand for riskier assets.  EON SE and  RWE AG (RWE) , the country’s biggest utilities, rallied
at least 3.5 percent each as Morgan Stanley upgraded its view of
the companies’ outlook.  Gerresheimer AG (GXI)  advanced 2.5 percent
after confirming its full-year revenue forecast.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  rose 2.3 percent to 7,810.63 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt. The benchmark gauge erased its losses this
month. The broader HDAX Index gained 2.2 percent today. In the
U.S., the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1 percent to 1,584.83
at 12:05 p.m. in New York.  “Markets are blazing a trail of bullish sentiment
supported by a belief in aggressive policy plans, Chinese data,
and a chase for returns in a low-rate world where investors do
not want to miss out on the momentum,” Daniel Weston, a
portfolio manager at Aimed Capital Management LLC in Munich,
wrote in an e-mail.  China ’s  imports  rose by a better-than-forecast 14.1 percent
in March, while  export  growth slowed to 10 percent from a year
earlier, the customs administration said in Beijing.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the DAX
was 7.1 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Utilities Rally  EON advanced 3.8 percent to 14.61 euros and RWE gained 4.5
percent to 30.36 euros. Morgan Stanley removed EON from its list
of “bottom picks” and added RWE to its “top picks.”  Gerresheimer, which develops and produces specialty
products made of glass and plastic, climbed 2.5 percent to 44.74
euros. The company reported a 10 percent increase in first-
quarter revenue to 296.7 million euros ($389 million), exceeding
estimates of 286.7 million euros. Gerresheimer also confirmed
its 2013 sales target.  Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s largest insurer, rose 3 percent to
108.30 euros as a gauge of insurance companies rose the second
most among the 19 industry groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest engineering company, added 1.9
percent to 82.09 euros as Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher 
reiterated a full-year forecast for sales.  Siemens will comment on this year’s profit target of 4.5
billion euros to 5 billion euros when it publishes its quarterly
earnings in May, Loescher said in an interview with Germany’s
Handelsblatt newspaper. Munich-based spokesman Oliver Santen
confirmed the comments.  SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) , Germany’s biggest solar-energy
company by market value, rose 8.8 percent to 19.88 euros, the
biggest increase in almost two months. A better-than-forecast
earnings projection by First Solar Inc. in the U.S. fueled
optimism the industry may be emerging from a slump.  Wacker
Chemie AG (WCH) , a maker of the main raw material in solar panels,
increased 5.8 percent to 59.16 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
