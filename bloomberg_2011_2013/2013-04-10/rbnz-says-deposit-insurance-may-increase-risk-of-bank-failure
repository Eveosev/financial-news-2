New Zealand ’s central bank says
deposit insurance may make banks more susceptible to failure
because it reduces the incentives to properly manage risk.  “We believe it is better to keep the risk of failure very
low including through a strong regulatory framework, than to
build structures that can distort incentives and behavior,”
Toby Fiennes, head of prudential supervision at the  Reserve Bank 
of New Zealand, said in a  speech  in Wellington.  Deposit insurance is not always effective in preventing
bank runs by depositors, and is hard to price fairly with a
chance that least risky banks subsidize more risky ones, Fiennes
said. When bank losses are large it may overwhelm the resources
of the deposit insurance fund, he said.  A recent World Bank report concluded that deposit insurance
led to more risky behavior by banks in the 2004 - 2009 period,
he said.  New Zealand doesn’t have deposit insurance, and the central
bank is proposing a system of open bank resolution as a better
tool to manage a bank in the event that it fails. That system
uses a form of statutory management to freeze a bank’s accounts,
then release a proportion of those accounts the next day with a
government guarantee to prevent further runs on the bank.  The two systems could work alongside each other, and it may
make it easier to manage a crisis by having insurance to deal
with the “political noise” from depositors, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
