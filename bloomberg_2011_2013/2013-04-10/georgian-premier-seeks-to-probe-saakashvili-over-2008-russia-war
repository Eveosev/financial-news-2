Georgian Prime MinisterBidzina Ivanishvili wants to question President Mikheil Saakashvili over
the country’s five-day war with  Russia  in 2008, a probe that may
lead to legal proceedings against Saakashvili.  The president and the government “acted inadequately” and
the Georgian army acted before Russian forces crossed the border
during the conflict over the breakaway regions of  South Ossetia 
and Abkhazia, Ivanishvili, who defeated Saakashvili’s party in
October parliamentary elections, said at a news conference in
the capital, Tbilisi, today.  Ivanishvili, Georgia’s richest man, pledged to improve the
rule of law and raise living standards. He also aims to develop
relations with Russia, which routed its southern neighbor in the
2008 war, recognized the independence of South Ossetia and
Abkhazia and vowed to defend their borders.  “Personally, I have questions,” Ivanishvili said.
“Everything was in the dark” during the war. “I think we need
objective facts. I’ve always said that it would be better to
start international monitoring.”  There is “documented evidence” that Russia initiated the
military action in the 2008 conflict, in which Georgian soldiers
and civilians were “dying before it all started,” Giorgi
Kandelaki, a lawmaker for Saakashvili’s United National Movement
party, said by phone today.  If Saakashvili is tried, that needs to be done in a
“cultured and civilized” manner to avoid damaging  Georgia ’s
image, Ivanishvili said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
