A $115 million settlement between
American International Group Inc. shareholders and former
executives including Maurice “Hank” Greenberg was approved by
a judge in  New York .  U.S. District Judge  Deborah Batts  granted final approval to
the agreement at a hearing today in  Manhattan  federal court. The
ruling resolves claims by AIG shareholders against Greenberg,
former Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith, former Vice
President of Reinsurance Christian Milton, former Comptroller
Michael Catelli and Greenberg companies C.V. Starr and Starr
International Co.  The plaintiffs, led by a group of Ohio public pensions,
sued in 2004 and 2005, claiming the Starr defendants misstated
their involvement in alleged market-division and bid-rigging
schemes and also misled investors about an alleged accounting
fraud at AIG that resulted in the company’s restating $3.9
billion of earnings. A later restatement reduced the amount to
$3.4 billion.  Proceeds of the settlement, minus about $16 million in
legal fees and expenses, will go to a class of investors who
bought AIG shares from Oct. 28, 1999, to April 1, 2005. On April
4, Batts rejected the single objection to the agreement that was
received by the court, ruling that the Orloff Family Trust
wasn’t eligible to object to the settlement.  The case is In Re  American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
Securities Litigation, 04-cv-8141, U.S. District Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
