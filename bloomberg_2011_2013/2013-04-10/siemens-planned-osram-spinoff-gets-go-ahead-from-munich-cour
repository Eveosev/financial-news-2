Siemens AG (SIE)  received the go-ahead to
list its Osram lighting unit from a German court, thwarting a
group of shareholders seeking to block the spinoff.  Appeals court Judge Martin Kainz in Munich threw out
complaints from the group of investors who said that  Europe ’s
largest engineering company hadn’t properly communicated aspects
of the listing at its annual general meeting.  The group of investors “did not participate adequately in
the AGM,” Kainz said. They had said that acoustic problems at
the Jan. 23 meeting meant they didn’t fully understand aspects
of the listing.  While 98 percent of shareholders approved the spinoff of
Osram in January, the group of investors sued to block the legal
registration of the spinoff. Siemens had canceled a plan for an
initial public offering of the business last year and decided
investors will instead receive one Osram share for every 10
shares they own.  Siemens, whose shares last year returned only one third of
the German DAX benchmark index’s advance, has also earmarked
units such as airport luggage systems, mail automation and water
technology for disposal as it’s combing through its portfolio to
weed out laggards.  The Munich-based company in January said that units making
trains and low-voltage gear also fell short of their potential
in the most recent quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
