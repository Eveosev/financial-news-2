Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the largest U.S.
utility owner by market value, bought two  Solarworld AG (SWV)  projects
in Southern California with total capacity of 21 megawatts.  The twin solar farms, Highlander 1 and Highlander 2, near
Twentynine Palms, California, will be run as one operation and
will provide power for more than 4,000 homes, Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Duke said in a statement today. Edison
International’s Southern California Edison will buy all the
electricity under a 20-year agreement.  Highlander is expected to begin producing power this
quarter and will be Duke’s largest solar farm, according to the
statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  With the deal, Duke owns more than 100 megawatts of
capacity at 15 U.S. solar farms and has spent more than $2.5
billion on solar and wind since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
