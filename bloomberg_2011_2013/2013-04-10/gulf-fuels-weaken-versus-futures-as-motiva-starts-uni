Spot gasoline and diesel fuel on
the U.S. Gulf Coast weakened as Motiva Enterprises LLC was said
to start a crude unit and exports of diesel were poised to drop.  Motiva is starting a crude unit at its 600,000-barrel-a-day
 Port Arthur ,  Texas , refinery, and has resumed operations at a
delayed coker, according to two people familiar with operations.
The crude unit, the smallest of three at the refinery, and coker
were shut in mid-February, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  Diesel shipments to  Europe  from the U.S. Gulf Coast were
forecast to fall to six medium-range tankers in the two weeks to
April 17, according to the median estimate in a survey of six
shipbrokers who specialize in the trade. That’s a six-week low
and decline of three from the earlier time period. Supplies of
distillate on the Gulf were  35.5 million  barrels in the week
ended April 3, Energy Information Administration data show.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, on the Gulf weakened 0.62 cent to 24.25 cents
a gallon below futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
2:33 p.m., the first decline in a week, Bloomberg data show.
 Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region fell 0.2 cent to a premium
of 0.3 cent a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , dropped $2.31 to $21.81 a barrel. The same spread
based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil fell $3.06 to $7.06 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
