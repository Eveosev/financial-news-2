Portugal ’s  consumer price index 
rose in March from a year earlier at a faster pace than recorded
in February.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
climbed 0.7 percent from a year earlier, more than the 0.2
percent increase in February, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Prices
rose 1.7 percent from February.  Using the statistics institute’s own methods, consumer
prices in Portugal rose 0.5 percent in March from a year earlier
and also climbed 1.7 percent from February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
