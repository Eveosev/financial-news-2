The dollar may resume its advance
against the yen as potential short-term gains in the Japanese
currency provide opportunities to sell it, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
said, citing trading patterns.  The focus for the greenback is the key resistance from
99.70 yen to 101.45, an area that contains the 50 percent
retracement of the currency’s drop from the 2007 “cycle high”
and the 2009 peak,Niall O’Connor, a technical analyst at
JPMorgan, wrote in a research note to clients yesterday. Deeper
targets start from the 102.35 area, the 76.4 percent retracement
from the 2008 high, he wrote.  “The overall upside bias is intact” for the dollar versus
the yen, O’Connor wrote. While the pullback in dollar-yen
earlier this week “highlights the importance of the next line
of key targets, there remains little evidence of a sustained
reversal at this point,” he wrote.  The yen was little changed at 99.01 per dollar as of 11:05
a.m. in  Tokyo  from yesterday, when it touched 99.66, the weakest
level since May 2009.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. Key
percentage levels include 23.6, 38.2, 50, 61.8 and 76.4.
Resistance refers to an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate orders to sell may be clustered.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
