Volatility in Colombia’s peso
increased to a 10-week high as the government prepared to
release a stimulus plan that Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas 
has said includes measures to stem the currency’s gains.  One-month historical volatility, a gauge of the magnitude
of the peso’s fluctuations over the period, is at the highest
level since Jan. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency, which strengthened 9.7 percent in 2012, has
dropped 3 percent this year. It fell 0.3 percent to 1,821 per
U.S. dollar at 10:09 a.m. in Bogata.  Colombia needs a more competitive  exchange rate , Cardenas
reiterated yesterday. President  Juan Manuel Santos  will present
a plan April 15 to help agricultural and industrial exporters
that have been hurt by a stronger peso, Cardenas said April 3.
He told lawmakers April 2 that he expects the peso to weaken to
1,900 and wants to “get there quickly.”  “The market has become pretty sensitive to the
government’s comments” on the peso, said Daniel Velandia, the
head economist at Credicorp Capital’s  Colombia  unit, previously
known as Correval. “That’s injecting a lot of volatility to the
market.”  Yields on Colombia’s peso bonds maturing in 2024 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.98 percent,
according to the central bank. The price rose 0.1 centavo to
142.511 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
