Copper declined after gaining the
most in three months yesterday, amid concern that rising
supplies will outpace demand from  China , the biggest consumer.  Metal for delivery in three months dropped as much as 0.6
percent to $7,586.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and was at $7,603 at 10:08 a.m. in Shanghai. Copper gained as
much as 2.6 percent yesterday, the most since Jan. 2. Copper for
delivery in May on the Comex fell 0.2 percent to $3.435 a pound.  Rio Tinto Group is “cautiously optimistic” that the first
commercial production at its Oyu Tolgoi copper project in
Mongolia will come in summer as talks advance with the
government, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, head of the London-based
company’s copper unit, said in an interview.  “Yesterday’s advance looks a bit overdone as the market
theme this year is that a deficit is turning into surplus,”
said Fang Junfeng, an analyst at  Shanghai  Cifco Futures Co.
“China’s macroeconomic conditions will be the focus -- if
Chinese demand is relatively good, then the surplus may be
limited, otherwise it will be a totally different story.”  China’s exports rose 10 percent in March from a year
earlier, missing a median estimate of 11.7 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey, while imports climbed by an above-
forecast 14.1 percent. Inbound shipments of unwrought copper and
products were 319,603 tons last month, the customs department
said today. That compared with 298,102 tons in February.  The contract for delivery in August on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.4 percent to 55,300 ($8,916) a ton. On the LME,
tin also declined, while nickel climbed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
