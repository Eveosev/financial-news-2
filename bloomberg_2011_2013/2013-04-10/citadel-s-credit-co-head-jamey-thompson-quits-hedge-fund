Jamey Thompson, co-head of Citadel
LLC’s global credit group, is leaving the $15 billion hedge-fund
firm after five years.  Thompson, who is departing this week, quit to be with
family in  Virginia ,  Katie Spring , a spokeswoman for Chicago-
based Citadel, said by e-mail today. Ryan Garino and David Grossman will continue to run the group.  Thompson became one of the three co-heads of Citadel’s
credit group in September, when the hedge fund merged its
quantitative credit and convertible-bond teams. He started at
Citadel in 2008 as a credit portfolio manager and had previously
worked at New York-based hedge fund King Street Capital
Management LP.  Citadel told clients about Thompson leaving late last week,
Spring said. His departure follows a management change in
Citadel’s equities group earlier this year when Steve Weller,
who was co-head of global equities, left after the firm picked
Brandon Haley to run the unit alone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
