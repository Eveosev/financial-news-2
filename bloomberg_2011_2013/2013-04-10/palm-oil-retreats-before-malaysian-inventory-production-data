Palm oil fell before the release of
data from  Malaysia  which may show that inventories dropped last
month, while output climbed for the first time in six months.  The contract for June delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent
to 2,382 ringgit ($787) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives exchange and was at 2,387 ringgit at 11:34 a.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures have gained 1.2 percent this week.  Reserves probably shrank 7 percent to 2.27 million tons in
March from a month earlier, the steepest drop since January
2011, according to a Bloomberg survey published April 8. Output
gained 2.3 percent to 1.33 million tons, the first monthly
increase since September, while shipments rose 2.1 percent to
1.43 million, the survey showed. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board is
scheduled to release the data at 12:30 p.m. today.  “Prices went up quite a bit in anticipation of the draw
down in stocks,” said James Ratnam, an analyst at TA Securities
Holdings Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. Traders are waiting for the data
for further cues, he said.  Inventories may drop to about 2 million tons in April or
May as demand remains strong, Ratnam said. Stockpiles have
fallen 7.2 percent to 2.44 million tons in February from a
record 2.63 million tons in December, board data show. Shipments
climbed 3.5 percent to 456,440 tons in the first 10 days of
April from 441,025 tons in the same period in March, Intertek
said today.  Soybean oil for May delivery was little changed at 49.94
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in May lost 0.4 percent to $13.905 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery was little changed
at 6,324  yuan  ($1,021) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month gained 0.2 percent to
7,946 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
