Fortinet Inc. (FTNT) , a provider of
computer-network security, tumbled the most in almost six months
after reporting preliminary first-quarter sales and profit that
missed some analyst estimates.  Profit excluding some costs was probably 10 cents a share
in the latest quarter, the Sunnyvale, California-based company
said in a statement yesterday, compared with the average
estimate of 12 cents a share, according to analysts’ projections
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were $134 million to $136 million,
versus an estimate for $140.4 million.  The shares fell in extended trading after beginning their
decline 15 minutes before yesterday’s close in New York. A weak
economic environment in Latin America,  Europe , Middle East and
 Africa , as well as inventory shortages contributed to the
results, while demand was strong in Asia and among U.S.
companies, Fortinet Chief Executive Officer Ken Xie said in the
statement.  “Our financial results were negatively impacted by a few
deals in the U.S. service provider segment which did not close
as expected,” Xie said, referring to Internet-access providers.  Fortinet declined 13 percent to $18.99 at the close, the
steepest drop since Oct. 17. The shares began  retreating  at 3:45
p.m. in New York yesterday, wiping out an earlier intraday gain
of as much as 2.4 percent.  Rick Popko, a spokesman for Fortinet, declined to comment
on the share decline. The company will release full first-
quarter figures on April 30, it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
