JX Nippon Oil and Energy Corp .,
Japan’s largest refiner, began talks with  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  for a
possible partnership to distribute the American solar panel
makers’ products in Japan.  JX Energy is seeking exclusive sales rights for First
Solar’s photovoltaic panels using technology developed by
TetraSun, the company said in a statement.  First Solar said yesterday it is acquiring TetraSun, a
startup based in  San Jose ,  California , from JX Energy and other
investors including TetraSun’s management. The move comes as
Japan is expected to become the largest solar market after China
this year, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy
Finance. Japan may add 6.1 gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts, BNEF said
in a research note on March 29.  JX Energy decided to sell its stake in TetraSun because of
First Solar’s capability to mass-produce, said Hiroya Nishijima,
a senior vice president of JX Energy.  “What we need is to start high-volume production as soon
as possible and First Solar is the most capable and appropriate
company to do that,” he said at a briefing in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
