Japanese and investors following
them may have purchased about $13.5 billion of non-Japanese
bonds since the  Bank of Japan (8301)  announced its unprecedented
stimulus last week, 10 times more than the previous  period ,
according to a Societe Generale SA estimate.  Speculation has intensified that money will flow out of
Japan in search of higher yields elsewhere after BOJ Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda said April 4 that the central bank will double
its monthly bond purchases to 7.5 trillion yen ($76 billion). He
reiterated today his pledge to achieve the bank’s 2 percent
inflation goal. Japan’s Ministry of Finance is scheduled to
report its net investment by major investors data today. Those
holders sold a net 117 billion yen in the week ended March 29,
Bloomberg data show.  Societe Generale’s estimate is based on a “deep
extrapolation” of South Africa’s daily bond flows and by
applying that data to a 6.6 percent Pacific Investment
Management Co. allocation, according Sebastien Galy, a foreign-
exchange strategist in New York at the bank. The rand has
rallied 3.5 percent to the dollar this month.  “If you’re an investor and you have to make a re-
allocation, you make a re-allocation along your entire
benchmark,” Galy said today in a telephone interview. “There
are few places that actually give you flow information.”  The yen fell 0.6 percent to 99.60 per dollar at 9:57 a.m.
New York time after reaching 99.72, the weakest level since May
2009.  Japan ’s currency dropped 0.7 percent to 130.42 per euro
after declining to 130.51, the least since January 2010.  “The demand from Japan is a mix of life insurers, asset
managers and banks,” Societe Generale wrote today in a research
report. “Retail investors are only a small part of total
flows.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
