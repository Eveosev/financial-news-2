Joe Mihalich has been hired as
Hofstra University’s basketball coach after winning 265 games
over 15 seasons at Niagara University.  Mihalich agreed to a  six-year contract  and replaces Mo
Cassara, who was fired last month after a season in which
Hofstra had a 7-25 record and had four players arrested in
December on burglary charges. Cassara was 38-59 over three
seasons at the Hempstead, New York-based school.  Mihalich won at least 17 games 11 times during his 15
seasons at Niagara, which is about 25 miles north of Buffalo,
New York, and led the Purple Eagles to five postseason
appearances, including two trips to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament. Niagara went 19-14 this year
and won the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference regular-season
title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
