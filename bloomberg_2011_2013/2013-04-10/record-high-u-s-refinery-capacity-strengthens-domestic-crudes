Oils produced in the U.S. gained as
refiners increased capacity to the highest level on record and
Gulf Coast consumption of crude and other feedstocks reached its
highest level this year.  Operable refinery capacity  increased by 116,000 barrels a
day to 17.8 million in the week ended April 5, the Energy
Information Administration, the statistics arm of the Energy
Department, said today.  “The refinery operating capacity reached its  all-time
record  this week,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “As the refiners have been returning
from their maintenance, we’re going to turn the high crude oil
inventories into more product inventories. As a result, I would
expect the demand for crude oil just goes up.”  Refinery  gross inputs  in PADD 3, the Gulf Coast, rose
92,000 barrels a day to 8.14 million barrels a day in the week
ended April 5, the EIA said.  Motiva Enterprises LLC’s 600,000-barrel-a-day Port Arthur
refinery, the largest in the U.S., is starting a crude unit, two
people familiar with operations said today.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s increased 75 cents a barrel against
domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate to $14.75 at 2:03
p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium declined 50 cents to $14.30.  Poseidon’s  premium  widened 45 cents to $8.50. Mars Blend’s
premium widened 70 cents to $8.70 and Eugene Island’s gained 50
cents to $13.50. Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed 30
cents to $7.70. Thunder Horse’s premium was unchanged at $11.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
