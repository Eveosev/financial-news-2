A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk held before the  Federal Reserve  releases minutes of its
last meeting and President  Barack Obama  submits his $3.77
trillion spending plan to Congress.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, tightened
0.4 basis point to a mid-price of 84.2 basis points at 8:09 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure reached the lowest intraday level since traders began
moving positions into a new series of the index on March 20.  The Fed will release minutes of its March meeting, when
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke left the pace of government and
mortgage debt purchases at $85 billion a month and said further
improvement in the U.S. labor market is needed to consider
reducing its monetary easing. Obama submits his proposed 2014
budget to Congress today, more than two months past its
deadline, after Democrats and Republicans deadlocked over taxes
and spending. Investors may look to the events to help gauge
economic growth and the ability of companies to repay debt.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
