Vietnam stocks advanced, heading
for a fourth day of gains, after the Ministry of Finance ordered
fuel retailers to cut prices.  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s  VN Index (VNINDEX)  climbed 0.8
percent to 514.68, on course for the highest close since Feb.
15, 2011.  Vietnam Dairy Products Joint-Stock Co. (VNM) , known as
Vinamilk, climbed 2.3 percent. PetroVietnam Gas Joint-Stock Co.,
the biggest-listed company by market value, rose 5.3 percent,
poised for a record.  Vietnam National Petroleum Corp., known as Petrolimex,
Vietnam’s largest petroleum-products importer, cut prices of
gasoline by 500 dong (2 cents) per liter last night after the
Ministry of Finance ordered the reduction to bring local prices
in line with the recent declines in global markets, according to
a statement on the company’s website. Petrolimex also reduced
prices of diesel and kerosene.  “Thanks to the gasoline price cuts last night,  market
sentiment  has turned bullish this morning,” Michel Tosto, head
of institutional sales and brokerage at Viet Capital Securities
Joint-Stock Co., wrote in a note to investors today.  The benchmark index has rallied 25 percent this year, the
second-best performer in  Asia  after Japan, as the country’s
central bank cut borrowing costs to spur growth amid slowing
inflation.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
