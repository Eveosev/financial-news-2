Steel reinforcement-bar futures
traded near the highest level in nearly two weeks as investors
waited for more signs that a seasonal demand recovery will help
absorb inventory of the building material in  China .  The contract for October delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchanged gained as much as 0.4 percent to 3,862  yuan  ($623) a
metric ton, the highest intra-day level since March 28, and was
at 3,850 yuan at 10:39 a.m. Futures have declined 3.5 percent
this year.  Demand for rebar in the spot market has gathered pace
recently with construction companies gradually starting
infrastructure and real estate projects in spring, Wang
Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing Cifco Co., said by phone from
Tianjin today. The average spot price of rebar increased 0.2
percent to 3,644 yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  “This is only the beginning and usually more construction
projects will start in the second half of April and in May,”
Wang said. “We expect to see a steady increase in demand.”  Infrastructure investment will accelerate with the
renovation of an “urban villages” project announced in the
government’s 12th Five-Year Plan, analyst Minggao Shen at
Citigroup Inc., wrote in a report dated April 8.  The spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port gained 1.1 percent to
$139.10 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
