Copper prices may fall to about
$6,500 a metric ton this year as a global surplus expands,
Thomson Reuters GFMS said.  Prices may trade at $7,500 to $8,500 a ton, with “risk
weighted to the downside to around $6,500,” GFMS said in a
report released in Santiago yesterday. Production may exceed
demand this year by “slightly” more than last year’s surplus of
214,000 tons, it said.  Copper for delivery in three months fell 0.6 percent to
$7,587 a ton by 1:45 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange. Global
mine production climbed 4 percent last year, the biggest jump
since 2004, while demand increased less than 1 percent,
according to the report.  The average cost of production was $3,527 a ton last year
and the marginal cost was about $5,512, GFMS said.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
