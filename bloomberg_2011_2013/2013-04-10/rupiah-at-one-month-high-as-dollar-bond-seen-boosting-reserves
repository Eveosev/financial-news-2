Indonesia ’s rupiah rose to the
highest level in almost a month on optimism this week’s global
bond sale will boost the nation’s foreign-exchange reserves.
Local-currency bonds were steady.  The country raised  $3 billion  from the offering and sold
10-year notes at 3.50 percent, a record low for non-Islamic U.S.
currency securities, according to a statement on the finance
ministry’s website. The cost to insure Indonesian bonds against
default fell to a two-week low. Foreign  reserves  fell $7.98
billion last quarter to $104.8 billion, the biggest drop since
Bloomberg began compiling the figures in 1998.  “The large volume and low yields achieved at the sale
improved investor confidence in Indonesia’s assets,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta.
“It will also help increase foreign reserves and give  Bank
Indonesia  more room to move in guarding the currency.”  The rupiah advanced 0.3 percent to 9,696 per dollar as of
9:33 a.m. in Jakarta and reached 9,695 earlier, the highest
level since March 14, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. It traded at a 0.07 percent premium to the one-
month non-deliverable forwards, which gained 0.3 percent to
9,703, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,743 yesterday by the Association of Banks in  Singapore , from
9,756 on April 8. Today’s rate will be released at 11:30 a.m. in
the city-state. One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
5.98 percent.  Five-year credit-default swaps tied to the nation’s debt
dropped four basis points in  New York  yesterday to 150 basis
points, the lowest since March 25, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The yield on the 5.625 percent rupiah bonds due May 2023
was little changed at 5.65 percent, according to prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
