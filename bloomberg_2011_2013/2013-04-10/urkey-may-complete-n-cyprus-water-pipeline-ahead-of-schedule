A subsea Mediterranean pipeline
transporting fresh water from  Turkey  to northern Cyprus may be
finished ahead of schedule.  “The construction on land will be finished by August-
September and the subsea section is planned to be finished by
the end of the year, so it will be possible to finish the
project some three months ahead of the March 2014 target,” said
Ali Cetin Amcaoglu, Agriculture and Natural Resources Minister
of the self-declared Turkish Cypriot state, in an interview with
Turkish state TV channel, TRT.  The 107-kilometer (67-mile) pipeline will cost about 1.5
billion Turkish liras ($841 million) and run from Alakopru dam
near Anamur on the Turkish coast to a dam to be built in
Gecitkoy in northern Cyprus. The subsea section of the pipeline
is 81 kilometers long, Amcaoglu said.  Cyprus has been divided between the Republic of Cyprus and
Turkish-held north since 1974.  To contact the reporter on this story:
