European Union finance ministers
will seek to resolve German concerns that a draft law to hand
the European Central Bank oversight powers doesn’t make a firm
enough commitment to explore changes to the bloc’s treaties.  Diplomats from the EU’s 27 nations agreed today that
ministers should seek solutions after  Germany  last week called
for several technical changes to a deal on the supervision plans
that was reached with EU lawmakers, according to an EU official.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  will raise the
issue at a meeting of EU finance ministers and central bank
chiefs beginning April 12 in Dublin, the official said on
condition of anonymity in line with EU rules.  EU leaders called for the new supervisor in 2012 as they
sought to tame a fiscal crisis that has forced  Greece ,  Portugal ,
Ireland,  Spain  and Cyprus to seek international aid. The move is
part of a broader plan to build a so-called banking union that
may also include a central authority for resolving failing
lenders, due to be proposed later this year.  Governments can accept some of Germany’s requests,
including that the EU should extend rules for firing the
chairman of the ECB’s bank oversight board to cover the vice
chairman, the official said. Still, the country’s position that
the law should make a clear reference to possible treaty changes
is more problematic, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
