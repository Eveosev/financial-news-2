West Texas Intermediate halted a
three-day advance as the International Energy Agency lowered its
forecast for oil demand and U.S. crude inventories climbed to a
22-year high.  Futures were little changed in New York, paring an earlier
loss of as much as 0.5 percent. The IEA downgraded its estimate
for global consumption for a third month and predicted the
weakest demand in  Europe  since the 1980s. Citigroup Inc. said
today that downward pressures on crude prices have grown. U.S.
stockpiles increased last week to the highest level since July
1990, a government report showed yesterday.  “Demand remains subdued and supplies are adequate,” said
 Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London, who
predicted that WTI will struggle to climb above $98 a barrel
this month.  WTI for May delivery dropped as much as 51 cents to $94.13
a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and was at $94.45 at 1:22 p.m. London time. The volume
of all futures traded was 40 percent lower than the 100-day
average. The contract rose 44 cents to $94.64 yesterday, its
highest close since April 2.  Brent for May settlement was little changed at $105.78 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, giving
the European benchmark grade a premium of $11.33 to WTI futures.
The spread was $11.15 yesterday, its narrowest closing level
since June 21.  Declining Demand  Global demand for oil will increase by 795,000 barrels a
day, or 0.9 percent, to average 90.58 million a day this year,
according to the  IEA’s April report . That’s 45,000 barrels a day
fewer than it forecast last month. European consumption will
slump by 340,000 barrels a day, the Paris-based energy adviser
to developed nations said.  Still, an imminent recovery in refinery operations after
maintenance and political threats to supply mean “it may be too
early to call a bear market,” the IEA said.  Citigroup Inc. is “moderately bearish” on oil prices this
year because the IEA and other organizations have lowered their
forecasts, Seth Kleinman, the bank’s head of energy strategy,
said at the Bloomberg Oil Forum in  London  today.  A U.S. Energy Department report yesterday showed that crude
stockpiles rose by  250,000 barrels  last week to 389 million, the
most since July 1990. The increase was still less than the 1.5
million barrels that  analysts in a Bloomberg survey had
predicted . Domestic production rose by 30,000 barrels to 7.18
million barrels a day, the fastest rate since July 1992,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical unit.  Oil in New York has technical support along its middle
Bollinger Band, about $93.42 a barrel today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures halted an intraday drop near this
level yesterday, before settling above it for a third day. Buy
orders tend to be clustered close to chart-support levels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
