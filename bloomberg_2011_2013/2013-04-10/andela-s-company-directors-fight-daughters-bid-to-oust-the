South African Minister of Human
Settlements Tokyo Sexwale and lawyers George Bizos and Bally
Chuene opposed an application to remove them as directors from
two companies started by  Nelson Mandela .  Makaziwe Mandela and Zenani Dlamini, the daughters of South
Africa’s first black president, filed papers with the  High Court 
in Johannesburg on April 9 to have the three men removed, their
law firm  Norton Rose  said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We are instructed to record our clients’ complete
rejection of the scurrilous allegations made by the applicants
in their papers,” Norton Rose said. Sexwale, Chuene and Bizos,
an anti-apartheid lawyer who represented Mandela at his 1964
trial for sabotage and conspiracy, were “were identified by Mr
Mandela and were in due course lawfully appointed,” it said.  Mandela’s daughters want the men removed as directors from
Harmonieux Investment Holdings and Magnifique Investment
Holdings, which have generated about 15 million rand ($1.7
million) in revenue from the rights to Mandela’s handprints, the
Johannesburg-based Star newspaper reported today.  Mandela, 94, is recovering from a lung infection at his
Johannesburg home after spending 10 days in a hospital in the
capital,  Pretoria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
