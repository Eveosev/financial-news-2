The Canadian dollar strengthened
against its U.S. counterpart for the third day as investors seek
higher-yielding currencies of commodity-exporting nations.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, gained on
speculation heightened demand from  Japan  for cross-border assets
will result from a stimulus package announced last week by Bank
of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda. The Australian and New
Zealand dollars also advanced.  “Because global central banks are pressing so hard on the
monetary gas pedal, especially now with the Bank of Japan, we
are seeing inflows from investors from  Europe  and Japan just to
take advantage of Canada’s relatively higher interest rates,”
 Sal Guatieri , senior economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a
phone interview.  The loonie gained 0.2 percent at C$1.0142 per U.S. dollar
at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It rose 1 percent to 98.38 per yen. One
loonie buys 98.60 U.S. cents. The Australian dollar increased
0.5 percent while New Zealand’s currency rose 0.6 percent.  Bonds fell. The yield on the benchmark 1.5 percent security
maturing in June 2023 rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.80 percent as the price fell 29 cents to
C$97.20.  Debt Sale  The Bank of Canada sold C$2.7 billion ($2.7 billion) of
three-year securities at an average yield of 1.155 percent. The
1 percent notes mature in August 2016.  Crude oil, the nation’s largest export, was 0.5 percent
higher at $94.64 a barrel in New York, after falling as much as
0.9 percent.  Canada ’s  discount  for its heavy oil to U.S. West
Texas Intermediate was $12.25 after holding at $12 the past
three days, the narrowest level on a closing basis since
October. The discount reached a record $42.50 a barrel on Dec.
14.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks rose 1.2 percent
while the S&P/TSX Composite Index, the benchmark Canadian equity
gauge, added 0.4 percent.  Kuroda, who took over as Bank of Japan governor in March,
said April 4 the central bank will double monthly bond buying to
7.5 trillion yen ($76 billion), while suspending a cap on
holdings. He said today that while policy makers will
continually monitor whether additional stimulus is needed, steps
taken last week are sufficient to achieve the bank’s 2 percent
inflation goal.  Japan Watch  “The market is wondering where does this Bank of Japan
liquidity end up,” said Adam Cole, head of Group of 10 currency
strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “Canada has been
left behind a bit because of the lower yield and the Bank of
Canada’s reluctance to raise interest rates.”  The Canadian dollar fell last week after Canada reported
54,500 fewer jobs in March, the biggest monthly employment
decline since the country was in recession in 2009.  In their last rate report March 6, Bank of Canada policy
makers led by Governor Mark Carney softened their bias to raise
interest rates, saying the current lending rate will be
appropriate “for a period of time.” The central bank’s next
rate announcement on April 17 may also contain references to a
longer pause, Guatieri said.  The Bank of Canada policy rate will remain 1 percent until
the third quarter of 2014, according to a survey of economists
by Bloomberg.  The Canadian dollar has lost 0.5 percent this year against
nine other developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Index. The U.S. dollar gained 2 percent and
the euro rose 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
