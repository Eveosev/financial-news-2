Hong Kong  stocks  rose to a one-week
high as speculation of Chinese government support measures
offset concerns about slowing growth in the nation’s economy.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s largest supplier
of the light metal, jumped 3.1 percent after the Shanghai
Securities News reported  China  may issue policies to boost usage
of the material.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688)  climbed
the most in five weeks after Deutsche Bank AG said the company
is likely to exceed its sales targets.  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings
Ltd. (3800)  surged 9.5 percent after a profit forecast from U.S. peer
First Solar Inc. beat expectations.  The Hang Seng Index rose 0.8 percent to 22,034.56, its
highest close since April 3. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index, which tracks mainland companies, increased 0.8 percent to
10,694.23 even after data on the nation’s exports missed
expected. The two gauges rose yesterday by the most in three
weeks as slower-than-estimated inflation data in China eased
pressure on policy makers to tighten credit.  “Although last month’s export figure wasn’t good, in the
future the government still has the tools to push up the
economy,” said Lewis Wan, Hong Kong-based chief investment
officer at Pride Investments Group Ltd., which oversees about
$250 million. “When inflation is controlled, the government has
more power to adopt loosening policies.”  Trading volumes in the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  were 15 percent
below the 30-day intraday average. The gauge’s futures added 0.6
percent to 21,966. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  dropped 3.6 percent
to 16.14, indicating traders expect a swing of 4.6 percent for
the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  Trade Data  China’s exports climbed 10 percent last month from a year
earlier, the customs administration said today. That compares
with 21.8 percent growth in February and the 11.7 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 36 economists. Imports
rose by an above-forecast 14.1 percent in March, leaving an
unexpected trade deficit of $880 million.  “We still have to see whether export growth will continue
to slow or accelerate,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating officer
at brokerage KGI Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “If you look at import
growth in March, which was higher than export growth, it may be
suggesting a recovery of economic activities. It’s very
difficult to highlight a clear trend.”  The Hang Seng Index briefly erased its gain today after  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s chief financial officer said he expects China’s
economic growth to slow. Prospects in China, BHP’s biggest
customer, present the main risk for the world’s largest mining
company, CFO Graham Kerr said today at the  Bloomberg Australia
Economic Summit  in Sydney.  Solar Shares  The Hang Seng Index fell 8.2 percent through yesterday from
a Jan. 30 high amid an outbreak of a new strain of bird flu in
China and as Cyprus’s banking woes reignited concern about the
 Europe ’s debt crisis. The measure traded at 10.5 times  estimated
earnings  yesterday, compared with its five-year average of 12.9
and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s multiple of 14.2, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  A measure of industry goods companies, which includes GCL-
Poly, climbed 2.1 percent, the  biggest gain  among the 11 groups
in the Hang Seng Composite Index.  GCL-Poly, the world’s biggest producer of polysilicon,
surged 9.5 percent to HK$1.61, and  Solargiga Energy Holdings
Ltd. (757) , a Chinese maker of solar wafers, jumped 8.4 percent to
38.5 Hong Kong cents. First Solar, the world’s largest thin-film
solar manufacturer by output, forecast earnings will be $4 to
$4.50 a share, exceeding the $3.57 average of 23 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Government Support  Aluminum Corp. of China rose 3.1 percent to HK$2.99 and
 United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer, gained
4.9 percent to HK$4.30. China may issue policies to boost
aluminum use, the Shanghai Securities News reported, citing Chen
Quanxun, chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry
Association.  Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s largest supplier of the metal,
climbed 1.1 percent to HK$16.82 after the London Metal Exchange
Index of industrial metals advanced 1.9 percent yesterday, the
most since Jan. 2.  China Overseas Land rose 3.1 percent, the most since March
6, to HK$21.55. The developer’s contracted sales in March
accelerated from a month earlier, indicating strong sales,
Deutsche Bank said in a report dated today. The company is
likely to exceed its contracted sales target for 2013, and there
is upside potential to consensus estimates, it said.  China Resources Land Ltd., the second-biggest mainland
property company traded in Hong Kong, advanced 3.4 percent to
HK$21.50, while  Country Garden Holding Co. (2777) , based in China’s
southern province of Guangdong, rose 2.8 percent to HK$4.07.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Asia’s biggest international
carrier, slid 2.2 percent to HK$12.72 after a two-day, 5.9
percent surge.  China Southern Airlines Co. (1055) , the country’s
biggest domestic carrier, slumped 3.1 percent to HK$4.01 after
the shares jumped 7 percent in the past two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
