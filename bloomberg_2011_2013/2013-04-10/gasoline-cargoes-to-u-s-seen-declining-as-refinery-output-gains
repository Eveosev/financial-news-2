The number of gasoline cargoes
shipped to the U.S. from ports in northwest  Europe  is set to
drop during the next two weeks as American refineries increase
production of the auto fuel, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Traders will charter a total of 22 Medium Range tankers for
loading over the 14 days to April 23, according to the median in
the survey yesterday of seven shipbrokers and traders
specializing in gasoline cargoes. That’s down from 34 vessels,
each able to haul about 37,000 metric tons, in last week’s
corresponding survey.  Refineries in the world’s largest economy  operated  at 86.3
percent of capacity in the week of March 29, the highest level
in 11 weeks, according to U.S. Energy Department figures.
Gasoline for delivery in May slid 6.3 percent this month on the
New York Mercantile Exchange to $2.9112 a gallon at 11:04 a.m.
in  London .  “U.S. refinery runs are increasing and utilization is
increasing,” Ehsan Ul-Haq, a senior market consultant at
Walton-on-Thames, England-based KBC Energy Economics, said by
phone today. “This is leading to more supplies for the U.S. of
summer-grade gasoline.”  Eleven of the 22 charters have been arranged and the rest
are anticipated, according to the survey. About 38 vessels will
be seeking cargoes, two fewer than last week. Ship bookings are
sometimes reported when still provisional and can be canceled.  Tankers on the trans-Atlantic voyage are  earning  $12,979
daily, according to figures from the London-based Baltic
Exchange. Returns reached this year’s high of $23,325 on Feb. 1.  The survey is based on the industry’s benchmark Rotterdam-
to- New York  trade route. The voyage takes about 11 days at 12.5
knots, according to the sea-distances.com website.  *T                              April 9      April 2     Change
