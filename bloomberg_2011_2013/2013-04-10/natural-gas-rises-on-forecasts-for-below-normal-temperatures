Natural gas rose in  New York  for
the first time in three days following forecasts for below-
normal temperatures through mid-April in the western U.S. that
may boost heating demand.  The futures gained as much as 2.5 percent as temperatures
from Denver to Texas will be below normal for the next five
days, Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in
a note to clients today. The Energy Information Administration
may report tomorrow that  inventories  declined for a 17th
consecutive week.  “We’ve got the cold in the central part of the country
providing support, and also the expectations that we’re going to
see another draw on storage,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker with Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The
longs are still in charge.”  Natural gas for May delivery rose 9.2 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $4.109 per million British thermal units at 9:55
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading was 53 percent
above the 100-day average for the time of day.  Denver  will fall as low as 23 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 5
Celsius) on April 17, 11 below normal, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  St. Louis  will drop to 38
degrees, 7 lower than average.  The heating and power-plant fuel has increased 23 percent
this year as cold weather erased an  inventory  glut. The EIA, a
division of the Energy Department, may report tomorrow that
stockpiles declined by 21 billion cubic feet last week,
according to the median of 11 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The five-year average change for the week is an
increase of 15 billion.  Price Forecasts  The elimination of an inventory surplus prompted analyst to
boost price forecasts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its 2013
outlook by 17 percent to an average of $4.40 per million Btu on
April 4. Morgan Stanley increased its prediction to $3.93 on
April 8 from a March estimate of $3.66.  The EIA lifted its price projection yesterday to $3.52 per
million Btu from $3.41 and cut its assessment of 2013 U.S.
production by 0.4 percent. Output will average a record 69.33
billion cubic feet a day this year, down from 69.6 billion
estimated in March, the EIA said.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators have increased
bullish bets to a record as prices advanced. Money managers
raised net-long positions, or  wagers  on rising prices, for a
seventh consecutive week to 393,885 futures equivalents in the
seven days ended April 2, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s April 5 Commitments of Traders report. It
was the highest level in records dating back to January 2010.  “Everyone is looking for the market to turn because of the
speculative length we’ve seen pile into this market,” McGillian
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
