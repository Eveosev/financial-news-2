Jay-Z is seeking to sell his small
stake in the Brooklyn Nets to expand his fledgling sports
representation business into basketball,  Yahoo Sports reported .  The singer, whose real name is  Shawn Carter , owns less than
1 percent of the National Basketball Association team, the
report said.  Selling his stake is necessary for Jay-Z to get
certification as an agent from the National Basketball Players
Association, Yahoo said.  New York Yankees All-Star second baseman  Robinson Cano  this
month fired agent Scott Boras to become the first athlete
represented by Jay-Zâ€™s Roc Nation Sports and Creative Artists
Agency. Cano will be a free agent after this Major League
Baseball season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
