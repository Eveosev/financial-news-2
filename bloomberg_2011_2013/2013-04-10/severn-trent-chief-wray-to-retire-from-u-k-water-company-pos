Tony Wray, chief executive officer
of  Severn Trent Plc (SVT) , the U.K.’s second-largest publicly traded
water company, is retiring next spring, the utility announced.  Wray informed the board of his plans to ensure time to
search for successor, oversee submission of a final business
plan for price review to the U.K. regulator Ofwat and “manage an
orderly handover,” the company said today in a statement.  Severn Trent said Wray will have served as CEO for seven
years by the time he retires. The shares have risen 21 percent
over the past year compared with a 27 percent gain by United
Utilities Plc, Britain’s biggest water company by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
