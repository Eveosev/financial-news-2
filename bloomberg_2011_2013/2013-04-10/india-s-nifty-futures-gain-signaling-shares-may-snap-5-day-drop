Indian (SENSEX)  equities climbed, with the
benchmark index rebounding from a seven-month low, after some
investors judged recent declines excessive.  The S&P BSE Sensex surged 1 percent to 18,414.45 at the
close in Mumbai, after changing directions at least nine times.
Software maker  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  jumped 2.2 percent after tumbling the
most in more than four years yesterday. Infosys Ltd. gained 1.8
percent before its earnings on April 12.  Housing Development
Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the nation’s largest mortgage lender, ended a
seven-day losing streak.  The Sensex dropped for a fifth day yesterday as concerns
company earnings will weaken amid the slowest pace of economic
growth in a decade prompted foreign funds to trim this year’s
stock purchases. The decline dragged the gauge’s valuation to
12.4 times  projected 12-month profits , near the lowest level
since June, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Value is emerging around these levels,” A.K. Prabhakar,
senior vice president of equity research at Mumbai-based Anand
Rathi Financial Services Ltd., said by phone. “The market is
near a major support. We expect a rally in the next few days.”  Infosys, the nation’s second-largest software maker, will
report earnings on April 12, kicking off the reporting season
for the March quarter. Net income at about 43 percent of the 30
Sensex firms trailed forecasts in the three months ended Dec.
31, compared with 40 percent in the previous two quarters.  Wipro jumped 2.2 percent to 402.25 rupees.  Infosys (INFO)  added
1.8 percent to 2,815.65 rupees. Larger rival  Tata Consultancy
Services Ltd. (TCS)  increased 2.2 percent to 1,530.45 rupees. Housing
Development Finance surged 4 percent to 783.15 rupees, ending a
seven-day 9 percent losing streak.  Fund Outflows  India ’s  economy  grew 4.5 percent from a year earlier in the
last quarter of 2012, the weakest pace since 2009, and the
government forecasts an annual growth rate of about 5 percent,
the least in a decade. The nation’s current-account deficit is
at a record and its inflation rate is the fastest among major
emerging nations.  Foreigners sold a net $114 million worth of local shares on
April 9 in a sixth day of outflows, the longest stretch of
withdrawals since May, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They
have invested a net $10.1 billion in domestic equities this
year, the data show. Inflows last year totaled $24.5 billion,
the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  “Selling by foreign funds in the past few sessions has put
investors on their guard,”  Arun Kejriwal , director at Mumbai-
based Kejriwal Research & Investment Services, said by
telephone. “We saw a dead cat bounce today but the underlying
mood remains cautious.”  Volumes on the Sensex were 27 percent below the 30-day
average and the gauge’s 50-day volatility climbed to 12.47, the
highest reading since Nov. 27, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The 50-stock CNX Nifty Index rose 1.2 percent to 5,558.70.
Its April futures settled at 5,553.70. India VIX, which gauges
the cost of protection against losses in the Nifty, slid 2
percent to 16.49.  To contact the reporters on this story:
