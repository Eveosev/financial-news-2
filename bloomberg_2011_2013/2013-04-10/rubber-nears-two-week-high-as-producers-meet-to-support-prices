Rubber climbed to near a two-week
high as the world’s three-largest producers begin a three-day
meeting to discuss measures to support prices.  The contract for delivery in September gained as much as
0.9 percent to 278.4 yen a kilogram ($2,812 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, nearing the highest level since March
28 reached yesterday. Futures traded at 277.2 yen at 11:13 a.m.,
paring this year’s losses to 8.4 percent.  Thailand , Indonesia and  Malaysia , the top producers
representing 70 percent of global output, meet today through
April 12 in Phuket to discuss price support measures, including
extending export reductions, according to Thai Deputy Farm
Minister Yuttapong Charasathien. Thailand, which decided to
extend curbs on shipments by 60 days to the end of May, is
expected to ask the other nations to join the move, said Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo.  “The market is supported by expectations for coordinated
actions by the three producers,” he said today by phone.  The three Asian nations agreed to cut exports by 300,000
tons in the six months through March after futures in Tokyo
slumped to a three-year low of 205.6 yen in August 2012.  The contract for delivery in September added 1.4 percent to
21,985  yuan  ($3,549) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board gained 0.6 percent to 82.25 baht
($2.84) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand. Price touched 81.75 baht on April 5, the
lowest level since November 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
