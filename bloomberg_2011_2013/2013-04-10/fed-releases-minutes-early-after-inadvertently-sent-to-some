Banks including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., along with congressional staff members and trade groups, received potentially market-moving Federal Reserve information 19 hours before the public in a release the central bank called accidental.  Brian Gross, a member of the Fed’s congressional liaison staff, distributed the March 19-20 minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday  Washington  time, according to an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News. Gross referred questions to Fed spokeswoman  Michelle Smith .  Distribution List The release was “entirely accidental,” Smith said. “This was a list of professional contacts that one individual had,” she said. “This group of individuals does not in any normal course receive any information early.” The mistake was discovered this morning, according to the central bank.  FOMC minutes, which include comments on the committee’s discussions about the direction of monetary policy and its outlook for the economy, are among the Fed’s most closely scrutinized documents as the panel debates when to stop its third round of bond purchases.  ‘Credibility Issue’  “It’s a credibility issue that the Fed should have addressed much quicker,” said Edward Lashinski, the Chicago- based director of global strategy for futures trading at RBC Capital Markets LLC, a primary dealer that trades  government securities  directly with the Fed. “The Fed is remiss in not taking action sooner to ameliorate potentially market-moving information being released to a select few.”  The Fed initially said recipients were primarily congressional staffers and trade organizations. A list of 154 recipients released later by the Fed show that banks also were among them. The list included Barclays Plc, BB&T Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Capital One Financial Corp.,  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Fifth Third Bancorp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Nomura Holdings Inc., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Regions Financial Corp., U.S. Bancorp, UBS AG and Wells Fargo & Co.  Other financial firms included IntercontinentalExchange Inc., the Atlanta-based owner of the world’s largest credit- default swap clearinghouse that has agreed to buy NYSE Euronext for $8.2 billion; buyout firm  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , and financial- market data provider  Standard & Poor’s .  After learning of the mistake, the Fed released the minutes to news media at about 8:35 a.m. under embargo for publication at 9 a.m. in Washington instead of the planned time of 2 p.m.  Stocks Advance  Stocks rose, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 1.2 percent higher to a record 1,587.73 at the close of trading in  New York . The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent late yesterday.  The Fed and the Labor Department have been at the forefront of efforts to tighten distribution of information to the media, which often operate under pledges not to release data, speeches and other news before an agreed-upon time.  Bloomberg News  and other news organizations last year opposed a Labor Department proposal to use government equipment for reporting economic statistics, a plan the agency said was aimed at preventing early release.  Daniel Moss, a Bloomberg News executive editor, testified at a hearing in June before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that the shift to federal computers “gives the government unfettered access to reporters’ notes and drafts.”  Labor’s Mishap  In August, the Labor Department posted jobless claims data to the agency’s website 15 hours before the scheduled release. At least one firm, Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton,  New Jersey , accessed the figures before the embargoed release time. Investors and economists monitor unemployment benefits data for clues on the labor market’s health.  Today the premature release involved the Fed itself rather than the media.  “The next time they point a finger at the media for being the bad guys this is going to be example ‘A’ that mistakes get made all the time,” said Lucy Dalglish, dean of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the  University of Maryland . “This is not just a media issue.”  The Fed contacted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the early release. The Fed Board also asked its inspector general to review its procedures.  “Certainly, for a public company, if disclosure was made selectively of material non-public information, the appropriate response for the company would be to, as soon as possible, put the information out to the public at large,” said  David Martin , a partner at Covington & Burling LLP in Washington.  Release Crackdown  The Fed’s public affairs office has explored for several months ways to increase the security around the release of Fed documents with the press, and this year narrowed the time between the FOMC statement publication and Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s press conferences.  Also among the recipients were staff members of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee.  The Fed’s congressional liaison routinely keeps congressional leaders and bank lobbyists informed about Fed policy with copies of testimony and other documents after they are made available to the public. Gross is a former staffer of former Senator  Phil Gramm , a Texas Republican who was chairman of the Banking Committee from 1999 to 2001.  A Fed spokesman declined to comment on why the minutes weren’t distributed more widely until 9 a.m. today.  ‘Not Fair’  “They should have released it as soon as they discovered the error,” said  Julia Coronado , chief economist for  North America  at BNP Paribas in New York. “It is not fair to give anybody an information advantage on policy deliberations.”  The minutes of the March FOMC meeting showed that several Fed officials said the central bank should begin tapering its quantitative easing program later this year and stop it by year end.  The members “thought that if the outlook for labor market conditions improved as anticipated, it would probably be appropriate to slow purchases later in the year and to stop them by year-end,” the minutes showed.  Lockup Procedures  Reporters in lockups at the Labor Department and elsewhere are given market-sensitive data 30 to 60 minutes before their broader release. The system gives journalists time to prepare stories and headlines that are published when a government employee opens communications lines to the news organizations’ computer systems.  The early release of sensitive financial information has become more common at U.S. corporations over the 15 years with the proliferation of new ways to disseminate data.  Chipmaker  Intel Corp (INTC) . inadvertently e-mailed its results in January to a group of reporters about five minutes before the end of regular trading. Google Inc., operator of the world’s biggest Internet search engine, prematurely released an earnings report in October, leading Chief Executive Officer  Larry Page  to apologize on the conference call for what he called the “scramble” of the early release.
