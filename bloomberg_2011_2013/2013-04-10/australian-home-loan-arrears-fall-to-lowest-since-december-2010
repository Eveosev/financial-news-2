Australian home loan payments more
than 90 days late fell to the lowest level since December 2010
in the fourth quarter of 2012 as lower interest rates reduced
the debt burden on borrowers, Fitch Ratings said.  The overdue payments on home loans underlying Australian
residential mortgage-backed securities fell to 0.55 percent in
the three months to December, compared with 0.63 percent in the
prior quarter, according to the London-based ratings firm’s
Australian residential mortgage performance index.  The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark
 interest rate  by 1.75 percentage points since Nov. 1, 2011, to 3
percent, matching a half-century low. Standard variable home
loan coasts were 6.45 percent as of March 31, the lowest level
since November 2009.  “The low level of unemployment, continued strong economy
and RBA cuts in the Australian benchmark cash rate during 2012
will provide a stable macro-economic environment over the next
12 months,” Fitch said in an e-mailed report. “Low interest
rates and over 20 years of economic growth have resulted in a
rise in real estate values and a significant build-up in
household debt.”  Payments between 30 and 59 days late climbed to 0.69
percent from 0.49 percent in the third quarter, partially due to
a slight increase in living costs, Fitch said.  Fitch expects the RBA cash rate to be at 2.75 percent by
the end of this year, it said. The company tracks delinquencies
of mortgages underlying prime and so-called low-doc Australian
residential mortgage-backed securities.  Australia  will stop buying residential mortgage bonds as
the cost of issuing the securities has recovered since the
credit freeze in 2008, Treasurer Wayne Swan said in a speech
today at the Bloomberg Australia Economic Summit in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
