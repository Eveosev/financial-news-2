The Holy See said it’s continuing
efforts to prevent money laundering and improve financial
transparency as the Council of  Europe  presses for compliance
with international standards.  In a report issued in July, Moneyval, the Council of
Europe’s monitoring body for money laundering and terrorism
financing, said the Vatican was making progress in complying
with international standards on financial transparency, though
it still needed to improve supervision of transactions. That
report stressed the importance of independent supervision of the
Vatican bank, which is formally called the Institute for the
Works of Religion, or IOR.  The Holy See’s next progress report will be presented in
December, according to today’s statement posted on the Vatican
Radio website. “With this initiative, the Holy See wishes to
provide a more complete overview of the measures taken over the
last year to further strengthen its institutional structure in
the area of preventing money laundering and the financing of
terrorism,” the Vatican said.  Moneyval’s recommendations are used by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development to decide whether a nation
should be included on the so-called white list of countries
complying with international standards on financial
transparency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
