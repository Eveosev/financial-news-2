Serbia ’s borrowing costs declined
at today’s bond auction, where investor bids fell short of the
government’s sale plan, as the Balkan country secured a $500
million loan agreement with  Russia .  The government sold 3.46 billion dinars ($40.5 million) of
seven-year bonds, compared with its 5 billion-dinar target, the
Debt Management Agency in Belgrade said in a statement. The
yield dropped to 12.25 percent from 12.65 percent at the
previous sale on March 5. Demand was 3.86 billion dinars,
compared with 3.8 billion dinars last month, the agency said.  Serbia and Russia signed a loan agreement, with a $300
million tranche available “soon” and a further $200 million to
follow after Serbia signs a new precautionary loan program with
the  International Monetary Fund , Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in Moscow today.  Yields have been pushed lower because “the sovereign has
borrowed heavily” from abroad “having just clinched a $500
million deal with Russia,” Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank DD analysts,
including Hrvoje Stojic, wrote in a note today. “Favorable
interbank liquidity conditions” also helped, they said.  Junk-rated sovereigns, including Serbia and  Hungary , have
tapped foreign debt markets this year to take advantage of low
borrowing costs as central banks from the U.S. to  Japan  buy
bonds to boost liquidity. Serbia sold $3.25 billion in foreign-
currency bonds since September, equivalent to 8
percent of the country’s gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
