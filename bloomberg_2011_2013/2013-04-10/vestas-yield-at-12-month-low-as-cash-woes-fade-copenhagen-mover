The yield on Vestas Wind System
A/S’s 2015 benchmark note fell to its lowest in almost a year as
Danske Bank A/S and Jyske Bank A/S recommend buying the turbine
maker’s debt on signs its cash troubles are fading.  The yield on Vestas’ 4.625 percent 600 million-euro bond
maturing in 2015 eased to 10.74 percent as of 12:14 p.m. in
Copenhagen, sending the bond to its highest since February last
year. The yield peaked at 26.1 percent on May 21, 2012.  Vestas is halfway through a two-year push to cut its
workforce by about 30 percent to 16,000 and aims to sell
factories to reduce costs and align production capacity with
market demand. The Aarhus, Denmark-based company persuaded a
group of nine banks in November to provide loans until January
2015 through a new 900 million-euro credit line.  “We have seen a positive reaction to the bond since the
agreement with the banks on a new loan,” said Janne Vincent Kjaer, an analyst at Jyske Bank, who’s advising clients to buy
the company’s debt.  According to Kasper From Larsen, an analyst at Danske Bank,
the company’s restructuring efforts are also aiding its credit
profile. He also recommends investors purchase Vestas’s debt.  Vestas  shares  rose as much as 4.7 percent today, their
highest since April 2. Trading volume today was 35 percent of
the average daily sales in the past three months with 789,121
shares exchanged.  Vestas, which is vying with  General Electric Co. (GE)  for the
lead in the global wind turbine market, has lost money for two
years as overcapacity in the industry pushed down prices. Even
after this year’s 46 percent gain, Vestas’s  shares  are down more
than 90 percent since an August 2008 peak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
