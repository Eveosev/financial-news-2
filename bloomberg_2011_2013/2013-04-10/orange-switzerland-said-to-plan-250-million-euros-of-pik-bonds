Orange Communication SA is
marketing 250 million-euro ($327 million) of 6-year bonds to pay
a dividend to Apax Partners LLP, according to a person with
knowledge of the deal.  The so-called PIK toggle bonds for the Swiss mobile-phone
company could be sold by tomorrow at a discount of up to 0.5
cents on the euro, said the person who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. The debt may
price to yield between 9 to 9.25 percent. PIK debt let companies
pay interest in the form extra debt at maturity.  PIK securities that almost disappeared during the credit
crisis are making a comeback as borrowers are seizing the
upperhand and showing little concern about the banking  crisis in
Cyprus . 22 billion-euro of high-yield bonds were sold in Europe
so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Orion Engineered Carbons Finance & Co SCA sold $425 million
of PIK notes at the end of January, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Orange Switzerland, based in Renens, Switzerland, hired
Credit Suisse Group AG as global coordinator with Deutsche Bank
AG, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan
Stanley acting as bookrunners.  The notes are issued at Orange Switzerlandâ€™s holding
company, Matterhorn Financing & CY SCA. They will trade on the
Luxembourg stock exchange and be governed by  New York  law.  Apax acquired Orange Switzerland in a 1.6 billion-euro
leveraged buyout last year.  A spokeswoman for Apax, who requested not to be named
citing company policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
