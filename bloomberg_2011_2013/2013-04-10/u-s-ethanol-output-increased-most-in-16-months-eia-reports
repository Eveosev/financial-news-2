Ethanol  production  in the U.S. rose
5.8 percent to 854,000 barrels a day last week, the biggest
weekly gain since December 2010, as costs eased.  Stockpiles swelled 1.8 percent to 17.8 million barrels, the
biggest weekly expansion since Jan. 25, a report from the Energy
Information Administration showed today. Inventories were 18
percent lower than a year earlier.  Ethanol is made mostly from corn in the U.S. Prices for the
grain plunged 13 percent in two days after the Agriculture
Department reported higher-than-expected supplies on March 28.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up a record 96 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, data from the Energy Department’s
analytical arm showed.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery tumbled 5.8 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $2.441 a gallon at 11:08 a.m.  New York  time on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest decline since April 1.
Prices have gained 11 percent this year.  The U.S. didn’t make any  foreign purchases  of the biofuel
from 49,000 barrels the previous week and unchanged from a year
earlier, EIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
