Malaysia’s ringgit rose to an 11-
week high after slowing inflation suggested  China  isn’t under
pressure to raise interest rates, supporting demand from the
Southeast Asian nation’s second-biggest export market.  Consumer prices in Asia’s largest economy rose less than
forecast in March, official data showed yesterday. U.S. stocks
climbed following the figures, giving the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index its first back-to-back gain in more than three weeks. U.S.
economic conditions are far from where policy makers want them
to be, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said April 8, an
indication the Fed will continue with its bond-buying program.  “There’s a cautious risk-on theme and the ringgit also
benefits from the fact that China is not going to rush into
tightening,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist
at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “Markets have scaled back
expectations of an exit strategy for the quantitative easing.”  The ringgit climbed 0.4 percent to 3.0243 per dollar as of
9:08 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.0225, the strongest level
since Jan. 21. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, rose six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.61 percent.  Government bonds  advanced for a sixth day. The yield on the
3.26 percent notes due March 2018 fell one basis point to 3.18
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
