University of  Kansas  freshman guard
Ben McLemore and  Indiana  University junior guard Victor Oladipo
will enter this year’s National Basketball Association draft and
forgo their remaining college eligibility.  McLemore and Oladipo are both projected as top five picks
in the June 27 draft, according to  ESPN .  The 6-foot-5 McLemore averaged a team-leading 15.9 points a
game for Kansas this season, breaking the school’s freshman
record set by Danny Manning in 1985.  “The NBA appears to like him quite a bit -- really, there
was no decision to be made,” Kansas coach Bill Self said
yesterday at a news conference. “Having an opportunity to
provide for himself and the people that have done such an
incredible job raising him, especially his mother, anybody with
a clear conscious would have to say ‘Hey, go for it when the
time is right,’ and the time is definitely right.”  Oladipo, also 6-foot-5, averaged 13.6 points, 6.3 rebounds
and 2.2 steals for Indiana this season while leading the Big Ten
Conference in field goal percentage at 59.9.  “There’s no question that he has the physical abilities,
the mental capacity, maturity and focus, the emotional well-
being and the spiritual background to be able to go and put
himself in a position now where he takes this next step,”
Indiana coach Tom Crean said at a  news conference .  To contact the reporter on this story:
