T-Mobile USA Inc. , which will begin
offering  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone for the first time on April 12,
will promote the move by letting owners of older models trade in
their phones for a lower price on a new one.  Customers who turn in their existing iPhone will get a new
iPhone 5 without the usual down payment of $99.99, plus a credit
toward future bills, Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile said. A
4S model, for instance, will bring a $120 credit.  As the fourth-largest U.S. carrier and the last to get the
iPhone, T-Mobile is trying to win over converts and publicize 
its novel approach to wireless service. The company has 
dispensed with the typical smartphone subsidies that carriers 
offer in exchange for two-year contracts. Instead, T-Mobile lets 
users make a down payment on an iPhone and then pay it off in 
$20 monthly increments -- with no further commitment.  T-Mobile, the U.S. wireless unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,
made the changes after losing 2.1 million monthly contract
customers last year. Along with the new installment approach to
buying phones, the company is offering service plans for as
little as $50. It’s part of a rebranding of T-Mobile as the
“uncarrier,” distinguishing it from larger rivals Verizon
Wireless,  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)   T-Mobile also is trying to shore up its customer base by
merging with  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , the fifth-largest
U.S. carrier. That deal will be voted on by shareholders on
April 12, the same day as the iPhone debut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
