A measure of investor protection on
North American high-yield debt averaged over three months
deteriorated to a record low even as covenant quality improved
in March, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  The average covenant score, in which 1 is the strongest
covenant quality and 5 the weakest, worsened for a third period
to 3.97 last month, according to Moody’s Covenant Quality Index.
While March’s single-month score of 3.76 improved from 4.17 in
February, it’s still the fifth-worst monthly score during the
past year.  Investors have been acquiescing to weaker terms from the
least creditworthy borrowers as the  Federal Reserve  holds its
benchmark borrowing rate close to zero into a fifth year,
encouraging bond buyers to seek riskier assets. The extra yield
investors demand to own  junk bonds  instead of government debt
narrowed to an average 471 basis points March 14, the lowest
level in almost two years, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data.  “Investors are still facing less covenant protection while
receiving relatively low yields,” Moody’s analysts led by
Alexander Dill wrote yesterday in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
