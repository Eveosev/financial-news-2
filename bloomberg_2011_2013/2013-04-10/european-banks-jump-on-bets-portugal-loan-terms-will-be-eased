European  banking stocks  surged,
paced by Spanish and Portuguese lenders, on expectation central
bankers will keep providing a stimulus and that the maturity of
bailout loans to Portugal and Ireland will be extended.  The 28-member  Euro STOXX Banks (SX7E)  index climbed as much as 5.3
percent, its biggest intraday gain since Sept. 6. Banco
Santander jumped 5.5 percent to 5.54 euros, the biggest jump in
more than seven months. Barclays Plc climbed 4.1 percent to
297.85 pence and Societe Generale SA rose 6.4 percent to 26.88
euros.  Creditors including the International Monetary Fund and
European Commission recommended loans to Portugal and Ireland be
extended by seven years in a joint report. Meanwhile European
Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said that
he expected the bank to keep rates low and continue injecting
liquidity into the banking system.  “There is news on stimulus measures and that is perceived
as positive for banks,” said Benjie Creelan-Sandford, an
analyst at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in  London . “There’s also the
recommendation that loans to Portugal and Ireland should be
extended and clearly that would explain why Portuguese banks are
up.”  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  surged 8.1 percent to 0.09
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
