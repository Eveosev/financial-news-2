Russia  proposed to increase
extraction taxes on oil, its biggest export earner, to raise as
much as 60 billion rubles ($1.9 billion) for road building.  The government is considering a jump of about 5 percent in
the levy as part of 2014-2016  tax policy , Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said today in Moscow. Ilya Trunin, a department head at
the ministry, said it’s a “reserve measure” to raise funds.  “While tax increases are always negative, we believe the
Russian government will take a balanced decision for the oil
sector and we view any radical changes as unlikely,” Alexander Burgansky, an oil and gas analyst at Otkritie Financial Corp.,
said by e-mail.  Russia, which gains half its income from oil and gas
revenues, is seeking to balance incentives to spur energy output
with measures to boost funds for infrastructure and social
programs. The  price  of Urals crude, Russia’s main export blend,
has doubled in four years.  The tax proposal is a “back-up plan” should the state
fail to agree on an increase in  fuel-oil  duties for next year,
Trunin told reporters in Moscow.  Russia has proposed raising export duties on fuel oil to as
much as 80 percent of standard crude duty from 66 percent,
according to Siluanov. The  Finance Ministry  has suggested
introducing the measure in 2014, a year earlier than planned, to
ease the transition to equal duties in 2015, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
