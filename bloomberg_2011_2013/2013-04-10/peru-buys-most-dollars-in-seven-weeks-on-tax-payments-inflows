Peru ’s  central bank  bought the most
dollars in seven weeks as companies sold the U.S. currency to
pay taxes in soles and banks scaled back their holdings.  The central bank sold local currency to purchase $170
million today, and said on its website it paid an average 2.5778
soles per  U.S. dollar .  The sol has appreciated 0.5 percent this month as companies
exchanged dollars before an April 19 deadline for monthly tax
payments. Dollar supply from companies and foreign investors
boosted local banks’ net holdings to $392 million on April 8,
they cut them back to $311 million yesterday, according to Banco
Central de Reserva del Peru data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Banks’ holdings were very high so they wanted to unload
some” greenbacks said Antonio Diaz, a trader at  Banco
Internacional del Peru SAA (INTERBC1)  in Lima. “Offshores have become a
little more active, selling dollars in the forwards market and
rolling over their expiring contracts,” Diaz said.  The sol was unchanged at 2.5780 per dollar at today’s
close, according to prices from Datatec.  The central bank issued 100 million soles in one-year
certificates of deposit to yield an average 3.74 percent,
according to its website. After buying dollars, the monetary
authority issues the securities to absorb the extra soles from
the market through a process known as sterilization.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 was little changed at 3.75 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.02 centimo to
125.86 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
