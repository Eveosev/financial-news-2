Genel Energy Plc (GENL) , an oil explorer
run by former  BP Plc (BP/)  Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward, rose
to the highest in five months after making a significant oil
discovery in Kurdistan.  The  shares gained  as much as 60.5 pence, or 7.6 percent, to
859.5 pence in London trading, the highest since November. The
stock traded at 858.8 pence at 9:16 a.m.  Genel, the largest producer in  Iraq ’s Kurdish region, said
the first of five Chia Surkh wells flowed 11,950 barrels of oil
a day and 15 million cubic feet of gas, the company said today
in a statement. It began drilling a second well this week.  “Whilst it’s early days, we’ve got a reservoir that will
bring significant volumes” of oil, Hayward said in a phone
interview. “We are only drilling big prospects.”  The field may hold more than 300 million barrels, Hayward
said. Genel operates Chia Surkh and holds 60 percent of the
license. The rest is held equally by Petoil Inc. and the Kurdish
government, according to today’s statement.  Separately, Genel is in talks with as many as four Turkish
utilities to sell gas from the company’s Miran field, Hayward
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
