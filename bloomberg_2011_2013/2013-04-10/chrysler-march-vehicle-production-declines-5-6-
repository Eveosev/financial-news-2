Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker
majority owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , said its March production slipped
5.6 percent from a year earlier to 208,043 cars and light
trucks.  First-quarter output also declined from the same period in
2012, falling 5.7 percent to 568,905, according to a chart
attached to a statement on Chrysler’s website.  Chrysler is preparing to introduce the Cherokee, a Jeep
sport-utility vehicle that replaces the Liberty, and is bringing
out redesigned versions of the Grand Cherokee and Compass SUVs.
The  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company has said those changes
caused lower Jeep sales early this year. Jeep brand sales slid
12 percent in the first quarter.  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of Chrysler and
Fiat, is relying on the U.S. company to sustain losses at Fiat’s
mass-market brands in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
