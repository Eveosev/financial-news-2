A $68.8 million settlement between
tenants at the Manhattan apartment complex Stuyvesant Town-Peter
Cooper Village and  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and  CWCapital Asset Management
LLC  over rent overcharge claims won court approval.  Justice Richard Lowe of New York State Supreme Court, who
granted preliminary approval in November, gave final consent in
an order dated today, finding the agreement “fair, reasonable
and adequate.”  The tenants sued MetLife and Tishman Speyer Properties LP
in 2007, claiming the companies improperly forced at least one-
fourth of the complex’s residents to pay market rents while the
owners received more than $25 million in tax breaks. CWCapital
gained control of the property after Tishman defaulted on its
senior mortgage in 2010.  The ruling “effectively ends the litigation” and clears
the way for about 27,500 tenants this year to receive settlement
checks ranging from $150 to more than $100,000, law firms for
the tenants, Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP and
Bernstein Liebhard LLP, said in a statement.  The case is Roberts v. Tishman Speyer, 100956/2007,  New
York  State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
