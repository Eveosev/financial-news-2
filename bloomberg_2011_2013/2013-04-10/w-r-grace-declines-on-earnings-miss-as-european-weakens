W.R. Grace & Co. (GRA) , the chemical
company that’s been under  bankruptcy protection  for 12 years,
fell the most in nine months after quarterly earnings missed
analysts’ estimates and full-year profit projections were
reduced amid weakening European demand.  Grace declined 3.2 percent to $73.50 at the close in  New
York , the biggest  drop since June 21. First-quarter earnings
before interest and taxes was $104 million to $105 million, or
80 cents to 81 cents per share, excluding some items, Columbia,
Maryland-based Grace said in a preliminary statement today. That
trails the 87-cent average of six analysts’  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  Grace also reduced its full-year profit forecasts, saying
weaker-than-expected economic conditions in Europe are affecting
sales growth. The unit that sells catalysts to oil refineries
and chemical makers was affected in the first quarter by the
loss of sales at four customers and delayed sales at another
five, Grace said.  “Order timing and customer operational issues negatively
impacted Grace refining catalysts franchise in the first
quarter, and  Europe  is coming in weaker than expected,” Michael Sison, a Cleveland-based analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets who
recommends buying the shares, said in a note today.  Full-year earnings before interest and taxes will rise 4
percent to 8 percent to $540 million to $560 million, excluding
some items, Grace said. That’s lower than a Feb. 6 forecast for
$560 million to $580 million.  Net Income  Full results will be released April 24. The company won’t
disclose the items excluded from adjusted earnings in the
quarter or the full-year outlook until then, Rich Badmington, a
Grace spokesman, said by phone today.  Net income in the first quarter was $52 million to $53
million a share, or 68 cents to 69 cents a share, Grace said.
Net income a year earlier was $60.9 million, or 80 cents a
share, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Grace filed for  Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  in April
2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
