Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest
publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, more than doubled
Chief Executive Officer Tom Wilson’s bonus last year as the
company’s stock rebounded.  Wilson got $6.16 million in non-equity incentive plan
compensation last year, compared with $2.25 million in 2012, the
Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer said today in a proxy filing.
His total pay, including salary, stock, options and the change
in pension value, climbed to $17.1 million from $11.2 million.  Allstate surged 47 percent last year, the stock’s best
performance in more than a decade, after Wilson charged
customers more for residential coverage. His decision to scale
back in coastal areas helped the company when Superstorm Sandy
struck the U.S. Northeast.  “Under Mr. Wilson’s leadership, in 2012 Allstate delivered
on its strategy to provide differentiated products to four
consumer segments while improving returns,” the company said in
the filing. “An increase in overall premiums and a doubling of
net and operating income in 2012 versus 2011 resulted in a
strong year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
