U.K. 10-year government bonds fell
for a third day, the longest losing streak in more than two
months, before the nation sells inflation-linked debt tomorrow
in its second auction this week.  The benchmark  10-year yield  has risen from a seven-month
low reached two days ago after a 3.5 billion-pound ($5.4
billion) sale of the bonds yesterday attracted the lowest demand
since June. The U.K., which is selling 151 billion pounds of
debt in the fiscal year that began this month, continues its
program tomorrow with a 1.6 billion-pound offering of inflation-
protected securities due in 2024. The pound was little changed.  “There’s about 5 billion pounds of supply in the 10-year
area this week, which might be leading to some concessions,”
said Mark Capleton, a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in London. “We had the first sale of the new
fiscal year yesterday, which came as yields were at very low
levels. I’m a little surprised the first auction didn’t go a
little better.”  The 10-year yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.78 percent at 9:11 a.m.  London  time. The
rate touched 1.625 percent on April 8, matching the April 5 low,
which was the least since Sept. 5. The 1.75 percent bond due
September 2022 fell 0.32, or 3.20 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 99.79. The three-day drop is the longest since the
period ending Jan. 28.  DMO Sales  The Debt Management Office yesterday sold 10-year
securities at a yield of 1.734 percent, down from 2.147 percent
at the previous offering on Feb. 21. That compares with a
record-low auction yield of 1.719 percent set on July 12. The
so-called bid-to-cover ratio dropped to 1.68 from 2.25 in
February.  The pound was at $1.5336 after rising to $1.5363 on April
5, the highest since Feb. 20. Sterling traded at 85.48 pence per
euro after depreciating to 85.60 yesterday, the weakest since
March 25.  The pound has declined 4.5 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar has gained 1.9 percent
and the euro strengthened 1.1 percent.  Gilts returned 1.5 percent this year through yesterday
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
0.8 percent and Treasuries rose 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
