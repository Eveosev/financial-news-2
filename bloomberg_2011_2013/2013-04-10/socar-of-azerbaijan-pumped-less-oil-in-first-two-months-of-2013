State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan , or
Socar, pumped less crude oil and natural gas in the first two
months of the year, reflecting a slump in total Azeri output.  Oil output at the national energy producer fell 1.2 percent
from a year earlier to 1.35 million metric tons, the company
said today on its website, without giving a reason for the drop.
Gas output retreated 2.8 percent to 1.12 billion cubic meters.  Total oil volumes from the Caspian Sea nation, the largest
crude producer in the former Soviet Union after Russia and
Kazakhstan, fell 3.6 percent in the period, while output of
marketable gas shrank 5 percent, the State Statistics Committee
said March 15. Production also declined in 2012 and 2011.  Socar First Vice President Xosbaxt Yusifzada said last year
that production had dropped because of aging wells. The Baku-
based company holds a stake in  BP Plc (BP/) â€™s Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli
oilfield, which cut production 7 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
