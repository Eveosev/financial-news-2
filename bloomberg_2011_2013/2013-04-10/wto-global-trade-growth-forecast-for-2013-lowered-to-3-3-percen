The  World Trade Organization  cut
its forecast for global trade growth again as the economic
slowdown in Europe suppresses demand.  Global trade probably will increase by 3.3 percent in 2013
instead of the 4.5 percent expected in September, the Geneva-
based body said today in a  statement  on its website. The WTO
previously forecast 5.6 percent growth.  International trade rose 2 percent in 2012, down from 5.2
percent in 2011, amid slow economic growth in developed
economies and recurring uncertainty over the future of the euro,
the WTO said.  “The events of 2012 should serve as a reminder that the
structural flaws in economies that were revealed by the economic
crisis have not been fully addressed, despite important progress
in some areas,” Director General  Pascal Lamy  said in the
statement. “Repairing these fissures needs to be the priority
for 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
