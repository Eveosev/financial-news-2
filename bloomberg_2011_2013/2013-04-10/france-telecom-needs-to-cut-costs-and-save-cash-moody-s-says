France Telecom SA (FTE)  risks a cut to
its debt rating if it doesn’t do more to trim costs and save
cash in the coming year, according to a Moody’s Investors
Service report today.  Pressure from competition, the sluggish economy and
regulators will intensify and weigh on the former French
monopoly’s ability to preserve its financial performance, wrote
Carlos Winzer, senior vice president and telecommunications
analyst. Moody’s  rates  Paris-based  France Telecom ’s debt A3, the
fourth-lowest investment grade.  “We do not expect competitive pressures to ease,” Winzer
wrote. “On the contrary, we think continued macroeconomic
weakness and the resultant contraction of  consumer spending  will
result in even more intense competition in 2013.”  Wireless-service prices in France are falling faster since
newcomer  Iliad SA (ILD)  began offering mobile subscriptions from 2
euros ($2.62) per month in January 2012. The  French Telecoms
Federation  has said it expects the decline to continue and have
an impact on carriers’ sales and profit. Prices dropped by 8
percent on average over the past 5 1/2 years, with the steepest
decline during 2012, the Federation said.  Half of France Telecom’s  revenue  last year came from its
home market. France made up 56 percent of the group’s earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Despite
efforts to diversify into faster-growing regions like Africa,
global sales fell 3.9 percent last year to 43.5 billion euros
and group Ebitda, excluding non-recurring events, fell 8.6
percent to 13.8 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
