SunEdison, the solar energy
development unit of  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , received a
$35 million loan from the North American Development Bank to
build a project at a U.S. Air Force base in Arizona.  The 16-megawatt solar farm at the Davis-Monthan base
southeast of Tucson will consist of 57,000 panels supplied by
MEMC and is expected to begin operating in the fourth quarter,
the bank said in a statement today. The bank was formed under
the auspices of the  North American Free Trade Agreement  to
address environmental issues along the U.S.-Mexico border.   The base agreed to purchase the electricity for 25 years,
and Tucson Electric Power Co. will buy associated renewable
energy credits for 20 years to comply with an Arizona law that
requires utilities to get 15 percent of their energy from
renewable resources by 2025.  To contact the reporter on this story:
