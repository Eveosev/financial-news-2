Ethanol plunged after an Energy
Information Administration report showed output last week jumped
the most in more than two years.  The biofuel dropped 3 percent after the Energy Department’s
statistical unit arm said  production  last week rose 5.8 percent
to 854,000 barrels a day, the most since June 29 and the biggest
gain since December 2010. Output has increased three of the past
four weeks as margins to make the fuel from corn have improved.  “It’s profitable today,” said Wallace Tyner, an
agricultural economist at Purdue University in West Lafayette,
 Indiana . “It’s what you expect to happen exactly happening.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery  decreased 7.6 cents to
$2.423 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
gained 11 percent this year.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline narrowed as gasoline futures
for May delivery tumbled 7.73 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.8651
a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations. The spread narrowed 0.13
cent to 44.21 cents a gallon.  Ethanol margins have been boosted by rising estimates of
corn stockpiles. The Agriculture Department forecast today that
inventories on Aug. 31 will be 757 million bushels, up from 632
million forecast in March.  Crush Spread  Prices for the grain surged to a record after drought last
year shrank yields, eroding profits to make ethanol and forcing
some companies to halt operations.  Corn for May delivery rose 4.75 cents to $6.49 a bushel in
 Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was 6
cents a gallon, down from 16 cents yesterday and up from minus
35 cents at the end of 2012. The amount doesn’t include revenue
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Stockpiles expanded 1.8 percent to 17.8 million barrels,
the biggest weekly gain since Jan. 25 and the highest level
since March 15. Ethanol-blended gasoline made up a record 96
percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool, data from the Energy
Department’s analytical arm showed.  The U.S. didn’t make any  foreign purchases  of the biofuel
from 49,000 barrels the previous week and unchanged from a year,
the report showed.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  last week cost $2.28 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Sugarcane is used to make the
fuel in  Brazil .  RINs Decline  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, for
corn-based ethanol slumped 13 percent to 80 cents, data compiled
by Bloomberg show, the steepest decline since March 12. Advanced
RINs slipped 11 percent to 85 cents, the biggest drop since
March 19.  RINs are certificates assigned to each gallon of biofuel
and used to track compliance with the federal mandates. Refiners
can also trade the RINs.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago slumped 11 cents
to $2.45 a gallon; in New York the biofuel lost 8 cents to
$2.61; in the U.S. Gulf the additive dropped 11 cents to $2.51
and on the West Coast ethanol slipped 0.5 cent to $2.775, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf jumped 10.5
cents to 26.5 cents, the most since July 23, while Chicago’s
discount to New York Harbor expanded 3 cents to 16 cents, the
most since April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
