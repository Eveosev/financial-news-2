Gleacher & Co. (GLCH) , the New York-based
brokerage that lost $159.8 million in the past two years, will
exit the fixed-income business and is in preliminary talks with
another company on a possible combination.  The decision will affect about 160 employees in units
including mortgage-backed securities and rates and credit
products, Gleacher said today in a statement.  Gleacher has been losing staff and clients have reduced or
suspended trading because of “questions regarding the strategic
direction of the company,” the firm said in its annual report
filed March 18. Gleacher also said at the time it has had
“significant turnover” among its workers.  Gleacher, whose shares were halted pending the
announcement, has  plunged  by more than half since the end of
2011. The stock closed yesterday at 68 cents.  “The plan does not include the company’s other business
operations, principally  investment banking ,” Gleacher said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
