Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) , controlled by
cable billionaire  John Malone ’s Liberty Media Corp., announced a
new chairman and directors following the takeover in January.  Greg Maffei, chief executive officer of Englewood,
Colorado-based Liberty Media, was named chairman, succeeding
Eddy Hartenstein, who remains on the board, according to a
filing yesterday. New York-based Sirius also added  Discovery
Communications Inc. (DISCA)  CEO David Zaslav and Evan D. Malone to its
board.  Liberty Media gained control of Sirius XM, the satellite-
radio broadcaster, in January after increasing its stake to more
than 50 percent over the past year. Three Sirius directors
resigned that month and were replaced by four people, including
interim CEO James Meyer. Mel Karmazin left as Sirius CEO in
2012.  Malone helped Sirius avoid bankruptcy in 2009, investing
$530 million to pay off loans in exchange for a 40 percent
equity stake. Liberty has made billions on the deal as Sirius
shares have advanced more than 19-fold from 16 cents on Feb. 17,
2009, when the loan was announced.  The stock rose 2.1 percent to $3.13 yesterday in  New York 
and has gained 8.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
