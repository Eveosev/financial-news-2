Spanish club Levante is interested in
signing striker Marouane Chamakh, who’s fallen out of favor at
Arsenal, the  Daily Mail  said.  Chamakh, 29, is free to leave the London club and Levante
is looking to offer around 1 million pounds ($1.5 million), the
Mail said. He joined Arsenal on a free transfer in 2010 and
earns about 65,000 pounds per week, the newspaper said.  Chamakh went to Arsenal after scoring 79 goals in eight
seasons with Bordeaux. He’s scored just 14 times for the Gunners
and spent part of last season on loan at West Ham.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
