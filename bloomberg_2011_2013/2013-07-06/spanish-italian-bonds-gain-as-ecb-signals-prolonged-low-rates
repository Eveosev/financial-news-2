Spanish and Italian bonds advanced
for a second week after the  European Central Bank  signaled it
will keep  interest rates  low for longer, boosting demand for
higher-yielding euro-area assets.  German two-year notes rose as ECB President  Mario Draghi 
said on July 4 that the central bank planned to keep its
interest rates low for an “extended period.” European bonds
pared weekly gains after a report showed employment in the U.S.
increased more than forecast, stoking speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will scale back stimulus. Portuguese debt slid for a
seventh week on concern the resignation of two ministers will
derail the attempts to plug budget deficits.  “What Draghi pledged this week will provide support for
most bonds in the region, at least in the near term,” said
 Richard McGuire , a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in  London . Any positive “impact may be offset by
any strong data out of the U.S. that strengthened the case for
the Federal Reserve to start tapering bond purchases.”  Spain’s  10-year (GDBR10)  yields dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, this week to to 4.66 percent at 4:50 p.m.
London time yesterday. The 4.4 percent bond maturing in October
2023 climbed 0.885, or 8.85 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,283) face
amount, to 97.96. The rate on similar-maturity Italian
securities decreased 12 basis points to 4.42 percent.  Euribor futures contracts climbed as investors added to
bets on lower inter-bank borrowing costs. The implied yield on
the contract expiring in June 2014 fell three basis points to
0.38 percent.  Forward Guidance  A report yesterday showed the  U.S. economy  added 195,000
jobs in June, compared with a median forecast of 165,000 in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “The risks for the euro area continue to be on the
downside,” Draghi said on July 4 after policy makers kept the
ECB’s key benchmark rate at a record-low 0.50 percent. “Our
monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as
necessary.”  In contrast, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
on June 19 U.S. policy makers may start to slow the pace of bond
buying this year and end it in mid-2014 if the economy meets
projections.  German Bunds  Germany’s two-year note yield slid eight basis points to
0.11 percent after reaching 0.08 percent on July 4, the lowest
since June 6. The rate on the 10-year bund was little changed at
1.72 percent.  Portugal’s 10-year bonds dropped with the 10-year yield
rising 68 basis points to 7.13 percent. It climbed to 8.11
percent on July 3, the highest since Nov. 21.  Italian bonds may be supported before a report next week
that economists forecast will show industrial production in the
euro region’s third-largest economy expanded in May after it
fell for three consecutive months. Industrial output rose 0.3
percent after contracting 0.3 percent in April, according to the
median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Spanish bonds returned 5.8 percent this year through July
4, according to the Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds
declined 1.2 percent and Portuguese securities lost 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
