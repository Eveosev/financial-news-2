Tottenham signed Brazilian midfielder
Paulinho from Corinthians, the Premier League soccer club said
on its Twitter page.  Paulinho joins Spurs six days after helping  Brazil  win the
Confederations Cup. The 24-year-old scored twice during the
tournament, including the goal with four minutes remaining that
gave Brazil a 2-1 win over Uruguay in the semifinals.  “I am very happy and excited to have joined Spurs,”
Paulinho said. “It’s a huge pleasure for my career to be at a
club as big as Tottenham.”  Paulinho becomes Tottenham’s first signing of the summer
transfer period. Spurs didn’t disclose terms of the contract nor
the fee paid.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
