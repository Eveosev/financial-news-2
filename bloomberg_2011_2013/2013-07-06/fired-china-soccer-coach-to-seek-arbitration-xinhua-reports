Fired Chinese national soccer team
coach Jose Antonio Camacho will seek arbitration after failing
to reach agreement with the  China  Football Association over
compensation for his dismissal, the Xinhua News Agency reported.  China terminated Camacho’s contract last month after the
men’s team lost 5-1 at home to  Thailand  on June 15, its third
home defeat that month. The 58-year-old Spaniard, who was hired
on a three-year contract in August 2011, failed to guide the
team to next year’s  World Cup  in Brazil.  A statement yesterday from Javier Ferrero, who represented
Camacho in talks with the football association, said it failed
to fulfill the contract and the two sides couldn’t reach
agreement, according to Xinhua. “We will seek assistance from
world football governing body FIFA and the Court of Arbitration
for Sport,” Xinhua cited the statement as saying.  The association informed Camacho on June 21 of its decision
to fire him as head coach while also promising to fulfill the
stipulations in his contract, Xinhua said, citing Ferrero’s
statement.  Two calls today to the China Football Association’s Beijing
office seeking comment went unanswered outside business hours.  Under Camacho, a former player and coach of  Spain ’s
national team, China slumped to its lowest FIFA World Ranking of
109 in March. It’s currently ranked 95th.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
