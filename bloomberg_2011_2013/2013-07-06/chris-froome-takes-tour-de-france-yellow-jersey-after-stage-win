Britain’s Chris Froome took the race
leader’s yellow jersey with a convincing win in today’s eighth
stage of the Tour de  France .  The Team Sky rider overtook South African Daryl Impey atop
the standings after winning the 107-mile (172-kilometer) trek
through the mountains from Castres to Ax-3-Domaines. Froome’s
Australian teammate Richie Porte finished 51 seconds behind to
move into second place in the standings.  “I couldn’t be happier,” Froome said in a televised
interview. “It has been a nervous week leading up to now but my
team has done a fantastic job and to repay my teammates with a
stage win and Richie coming second, I couldn’t have asked for
more.”  Spain ’s Alejandro Valverde is 68 seconds behind Froome,
with Bauke Mollema of the Netherlands a further two seconds
back.  Impey of the Orica-Greenedge team, the first South African
to lead the Tour, finished almost eight minutes back today and
dropped down to 31st place.  Two-time champion  Alberto Contador  is 1 minute, 45 seconds
off the lead in eighth place, after finishing nearly two minutes
behind Froome today.  Froome, a Kenya-born Briton who was second last year, is
the favorite to win the 100th edition of the race, according to
seven bookmakers’ odds on oddschecker.com. Contador of Spain is
the second favorite. The 2012 champion Bradley Wiggins is absent
because of injury.  Tomorrow’s ninth stage is a 121-mile ride from Saint-Girons
to Bagneres-de-Bigorre. The Tour, which covers 2,116 miles, ends
July 21 in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
