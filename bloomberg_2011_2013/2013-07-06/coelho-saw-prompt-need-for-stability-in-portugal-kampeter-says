Portuguese Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  grasped the need to restore political stability
after cabinet resignations caused sovereign bond yields to jump,
said German Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter.  Coelho has presented a plan to keep his government intact
after wrangling over budget policy prompted Finance Minister
Vitor Gaspar and Foreign Minister Paulo Portas to resign this
week, endangering the ruling coalition’s stability. Coelho said
yesterday that a “way will be found” to secure the viability
of the coalition between the Social Democrats and the CDS party.  “I’ve full confidence that the plan that the prime
minister has developed will restore calm to markets in a short
time,” said Kampeter, a  Christian Democrat , in an interview at
a meeting of his party in the North-Rhine Westphalian town of
Bad Salzuflen. “Portugal will quickly be back on track.”  The yield on Portugal’s 10-year sovereign bond fell
yesterday to 7.13 percent. It climbed to 8.11 percent on July 3,
the highest since Nov. 21. Portugal’s credit rating outlook was
revised to negative from stable by Standard & Poor’s yesterday.  Coelho, who leads the  Social Democrats , needs the CDS for a
majority in parliament to pass measures and meet terms of a
bailout from the European Union and  International Monetary Fund 
that ends in June 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
