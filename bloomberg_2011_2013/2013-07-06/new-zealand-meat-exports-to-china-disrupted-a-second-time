New Zealand  meat shipments to China
are being disrupted for the second time in two months after a
change in that nation’s rules for meat certification, Primary
Industries Minister Nathan Guy said.  New Zealand became aware of China’s new rules on July 4
when a shipment of meat was delayed at the port of Dalian, Guy
said in an e-mailed statement. Other consignments may be
affected as New Zealand implements changes in response, he said.  “We were made aware that China had issued new rules for
New Zealand meat certification,” Guy said. “In the last 48
hours we have sought clarity around the impacts of those
requirements and officials have negotiated their
implementation.”  China  is New Zealand’s second-largest customer for exports
and the biggest buyer of the South Pacific nation’s sheep meat.
In May, containers of frozen New Zealand meat were delayed for
more than two weeks because they didn’t have the correct
certification.  New Zealand will implement new rules to satisfy the latest
Chinese requirements from July 8, Guy said. Officials have also
agreed with their Chinese counterparts on arrangements for
shipments currently en-route to China.  China’s new rules affect 1,323 consignments or about 30,000
metric tons, shipped since June 1, Guy said. About a quarter of
these will be “practically affected and any delay may only be a
couple of days,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
