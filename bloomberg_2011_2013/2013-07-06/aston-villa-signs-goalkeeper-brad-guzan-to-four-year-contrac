Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan
signed a four-year contract through the end of the 2016-17
season, the Premier League soccer club said on its website.  Guzan, 28, replaced Shay Given as Villa’s starter last
season. He appeared in 36 games and was named player of the year
by both his teammates and fans.  “It’s always nice when you’re wanted by a club,” the U.S.
international said. “I’ve had some good years here at Aston
Villa and to be able to commit my future just puts a smile on my
face.”  Guzan has played 44 games since joining Villa in 2008 from
Major League Soccer’s Chivas USA. He spent the 2010-11 season on
loan at Hull City.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
