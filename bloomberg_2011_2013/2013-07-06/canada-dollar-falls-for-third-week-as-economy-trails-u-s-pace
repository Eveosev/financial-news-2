The Canadian dollar fell in the
longest streak since May as the country’s job market stagnated
while U.S. employment growth exceeded forecasts, adding to
evidence the two countries’ economies are diverging.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, reached the
lowest level in almost two years as U.S. June payroll data
prompted speculation the  Federal Reserve  will start winding down
monetary stimulus this year. Canada’s employment was little
changed, with 400 jobs lost in June after adding 95,000 the
month before, the most in more than a decade. Building permits
dropped in May, according to median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey before a July 8 report from  Statistics Canada .  “The Canadian dollar is going to continue to weaken,”
said  Adrian Miller , the head of fixed-income strategy at GMP
Securities LLC, by phone from  New York . “The private sector as
a whole is still losing jobs. The take away from that is that
business investment, which the Bank of Canada looks to as one of
the drivers, is going to struggle to materialize.”  The loonie fell 0.6 percent this week to C$1.0582 per U.S.
dollar in Toronto, the third straight drop, the most since four
straight weekly declines in the period ended May 31. The
currency touched C$1.0609 per U.S. dollar yesterday, its weakest
level since Oct. 4, 2011. One loonie buys 94.50 U.S. cents.  Winners, Losers  Canada’s dollar lost the most this week against its U.S.
counterpart among major currencies. It rose the most, 2.6
percent, versus  South Africa ’s rand. Markets in Toronto were
closed July 1 for the Canada Day holiday.  The currency’s 14-day relative strength index against the
dollar was at 68, almost the 70 level that some traders see as a
signal an asset has moved too far, too fast and may be due to
reverse course.  Yields on Canada’s benchmark 10-year  bonds  rose to their
highest point in almost two years. The 1.5 percent security
maturing in June 2023 lost 92 cents to C$90.89, with yields
rising 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 2.55
percent, reaching the highest since August 2011.  The  Bank of Canada  will auction C$3.4 billion ($3.2
billion) of five-year notes with a coupon of 1.25 percent on
July 10.  Jobs Data  Canada’s job gains have slowed this year, with the average
monthly increase of 14,000 less than the 27,000 recorded in the
second half of last year, Statistics Canada said July 5.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s largest export, rose 7.3
percent to $103.60 per barrel in New York. Western Canada
Select, the benchmark for oil-sands bitumen, traded at a
discount of $15.75 to U.S. West Texas Intermediate price, up
from $9.25 on June 12, the low for the year. The difference
reached $41.50 on Jan. 14.  “When you have the oil price at 100 bucks and the Canadian
dollar at C$1.06 that tells you it’s more a U.S. story than a
made-in- Canada  story,” said Clement Gignac, chief economist at
Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc., by
phone from  Quebec City . “There’s no doubt in my mind that
quantitative easing phasing out will start this fall and will
finish probably next spring.”  Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. said the Fed will begin tapering sooner than they had
expected after U.S jobs data on July 5, which showed employers
added 195,000 workers to payrolls for a second month in June.
The gain exceeded the median forecast for a 165,000 increase in
a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Fed View  The U.S. jobless rate stayed at 7.6 percent, while hourly
earnings in the year ended in June advanced by the most since
July 2011. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June 19
reductions in the U.S. central bank’s bond-buying program, which
tends to devalue the currency, will depend on improvements in
the job market. The Fed’s next policy meeting announcement is
July 31.  The Bank of Canada will hold the benchmark  interest rate  at
1 percent for the rest of the year, according to all but one of
24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Traders are pricing in 5.6
basis points of tightening by the Bank of Canada’s Dec. 4
meeting, calculations based on trading in overnight index swaps
show.  The central bank’s next rate decision is July 17.  The Bank of Canada has left interest rates unchanged since
2010 in the longest  pause  since the 1950s. The bank has included
a warning its next move on interest rates would be to raise them
in every policy statement for more than a year.  Growth Differences  Canada’s economic growth this year will be 1.7 percent,
trailing the U.S.’s 1.9 percent, according to the median
estimates of economist surveys by Bloomberg. U.S. out
performance is forecast to continue until 2015, Bloomberg
surveys show.  “We think Canadian economic growth should be somewhat slow
and the  U.S. economy  should be somewhat stronger,” said David Doyle, a strategist at Macquarie Capital Markets, by phone from
Toronto. “When those sorts of dynamics occur they tend to occur
alongside periods where the loonie weakens.”  The cost to insure against declines in the loonie versus
its U.S. peer increased from its lowest point in two weeks. The
three-month so-called 25-delta risk reversal rate rose to 1.6200
yesterday, after hitting 1.5825 the day before, its lowest since
June 20. Risk reversals measure the premium on options contracts
to sell Canadian dollars versus buying U.S. contracts that do
the opposite.  The Canadian dollar has dropped 0.4 percent in the past six
months against nine developed nations currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Index. The Australian dollar has
posted a 8.4 percent drop, while the  U.S. dollar  has jumped 7.6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
