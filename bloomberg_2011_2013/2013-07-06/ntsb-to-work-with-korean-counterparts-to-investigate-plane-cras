The U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board says it will work with its Korean counterparts in
investigating today’s crash of a Boeing 777 operated by  Asiana
Airlines Inc. (020560)  from Seoul at San Francisco International Airport.  Deborah Hersman , the NTSB chairman, said Washington-based
investigators would join three investigators from the Los
Angeles area at the airport later today to begin work. Hersman
said  Boeing Co. (BA) , which made the aircraft, would be a part of the
investigation.  “We have not determined what the focus of this
investigation is,” Hersman said. When asked if the cause might
be pilot error, she said, “Everything’s on the table.”  Witnesses said the tail of the aircraft hit the runaway
first and broke off as the plane was landing just before noon
San Francisco time. It then spun out of control and burst into
flames.  To contact the reporter on this story:
