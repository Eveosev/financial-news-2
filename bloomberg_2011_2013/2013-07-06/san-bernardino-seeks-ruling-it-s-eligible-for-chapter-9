San Bernardino asked a bankruptcy
judge to set aside the objections of two public employees’
pension funds and rule that the  California  city is eligible for
Chapter 9 protection.  Lawyers for the city filed a request for summary judgment
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Riverside, California.  “The city requests that the court deny all the objections
in their entirety and enter an order for relief so that the city
can continue discussions and negotiations with its creditors,
devote more of its limited resources to those negotiations, and
prepare and propose a plan of adjustment,” lawyers for San
Bernardino said in the filing.  The city sought bankruptcy on Aug. 1, claiming a cash
crisis prevented it from negotiating with creditors first, which
is a requirement under California law. The California Public
Employees’ Retirement System and the San Bernardino Public
Employees’ Association have challenged the legality of the
filing.  The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-28006, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Central District of California (Riverside).  To contact the reporter on this story:
