Treasury yields rose to the highest
in almost two years as the U.S. added more jobs than forecast
for a third month, boosting bets the  Federal Reserve  will begin
curbing the pace of its bond purchases as soon as September.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year  note  climbed the most
since August 2011 after a Labor Department report yesterday
showed the economy added 195,000 jobs in June, compared with the
median forecast of 165,000 in a Bloomberg News survey. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month policy makers may
“moderate” their asset-purchase program later this year and
may end it mid-2014 if economic growth meets forecasts. The
Treasury will sell $66 billion of securities next week.  “You got a number that basically gave the Fed the green
light,” said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. rates sales at ED&F
Man Capital Markets in New York. “It’s a massive selloff, and
I’m not sure it’s going to be over soon with supply coming next
week.”  The benchmark 10-year  note yield  rose 25 basis points, or
0.25 percentage point, to 2.74 percent this week in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, closing at the
highest level since August 2011. The price of the 1.75 percent
security due in May 2023 fell 2 2/32, or $20.63 per $1,000 face
amount, to 91 1/2.  The yield on the  30-year bond  rose 21 basis points to 3.71
percent.  ‘Genie’s Out’  “Now that the genie’s out of the bottle, what you don’t
want to do is sell into the teeth of selling pressure in the
market,” said  Kevin Flanagan , a Purchase, New York-based fixed-income strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.  Flanagan forecasts that the 10-year yield will end 2013 at
2.75 percent, and said that investors who want to sell
government debt may have opportunities to do so at somewhat
lower yields.  “It’s great to see payrolls at 195,000,” he said, “but
the broader economic setting is still not a very robust one.”  U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a revised 1.8
percent annualized rate from January through March, down from a
prior estimate of 2.4 percent, the Commerce Department said June
26. The economy will grow 1.9 percent for 2013, according to the
median forecast of 86 economists in a Bloomberg News survey in
June, down from last year’s 2.2 percent increase.  The  unemployment rate  for June remained at 7.6 percent
compared with the Bloomberg News survey of economists forecast
of 7.5 percent. The economy has added an average of 189,000 jobs
this year through May, the fastest pace since 2005 when it
created 207,000 positions per month, Labor Department data show.  ‘Taper Trail’  “It is a strong report that does keep the Fed on the taper
trail,”  Tony Crescenzi , executive vice president at  Newport
Beach , California-based Pacific Investment Management Co., said
of the employment data yesterday on Bloomberg radio.  Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. said the  Federal Open Market Committee  will begin tapering
its $85 billion-a-month buying program sooner than they had
expected after today’s Labor Department report.  An improving  economy  is also dimming the lure of bonds as a
haven. The Conference Board’s Consumer  Confidence (CONCCONF)  index rose in
June to 81.4, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey and
the highest since January 2008, the New York-based private
research group said June 25.  Home prices  have  increased  12
percent since April 2012, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller
Composite index.  Consumer Confidence  “The labor market has continued to improve,” Bernanke
said at his June 19 press conference. “Job gains, along with
the strengthening housing market, have in turn contributed to
increases in  consumer confidence  and supported household
spending.”  The 30-year swap spread moved above zero in a continuation
of the rise that has taken place over the past year as Dodd-Frank Act regulations increased costs for swap transactions and
made  Treasury securities  an attractive alternative.  The spread was 2.75 basis points, after being as much as
negative 12 basis points on June 19.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged
yesterday to keep  interest rates  at a record low for an
“extended period.”  A measure of demand at the U.S. Treasury Department’s debt
auctions has fallen this year to the lowest level since 2009 as
a drop in bond prices generates the biggest losses on  government
securities  in four years.  Investors bid $2.94 for each $1 of the $1.077 billion of
notes and bonds sold by the Treasury this year, compared with a
record high $3.15 of bids last year. It’s the first decline in
demand at the auctions since 2008, when the U.S. government
increased note and bond offerings 59 percent to $922 billion as
the recession and the financial crisis deepened.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion in three-year notes, $21
billion in 10-year debt and $13 billion in 30-year notes on
three consecutive days starting July 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
