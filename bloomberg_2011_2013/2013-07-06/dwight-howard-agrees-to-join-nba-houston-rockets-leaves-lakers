Center  Dwight Howard  has decided to
join the  Houston Rockets .  Howard made his announcement on his Twitter.com site
tonight shortly after Los Angeles Laker General Manager Mitch
Kupchak said the player had informed the team he was not
staying.  The 27-year-old Howard, a seven-time All-Star, was regarded
as the top free agent this offseason. The 6-foot-11 center has
averaged 18.3 points, 12.9 rebounds and 2.2 blocked shots a game
during his nine-year career.  The Lakers were able to offer Howard a contract worth $118
million over five years, the NBA’s maximum. The most money other
teams could give him was $88 million over four years.  NBA players can agree on contracts, though they can’t sign
until July 10, when the league’s moratorium on trades and
signings is lifted.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
