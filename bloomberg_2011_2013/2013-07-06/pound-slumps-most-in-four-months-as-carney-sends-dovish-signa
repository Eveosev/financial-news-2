The pound slumped the most this week
versus the dollar since February amid speculation the  Bank of
England  is ready to maintain stimulus measures that typically
debase the currency.  Sterling slid to a two-month low against the euro after the
central bank, led by new Governor  Mark Carney , signaled it will
keep  interest rates  at a record low for longer than investors
had expected. The U.K. recovery “remains weak” by historical
standards and rising market borrowing costs pose a threat to the
expansion, the BOE said in a statement after its July 3-4
meeting. Gilts fell for a third week as U.S. data yesterday
showed employers added more jobs than economists forecast.  “Carney has a track record of being a dove, and he made it
clear this week that U.K. rates will stay low,” said  Henrik Gullberg , a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in  London .
“That, and the further evidence that the U.S. economic recovery
is gaining traction, will continue to add pressure on
sterling.”  The pound fell 2 percent this week to $1.4909 at 5 p.m.
London time yesterday, the steepest decline since the period
ended Feb. 22. It reached $1.4858 yesterday, the lowest level
since March 12. Britain’s currency depreciated 0.6 percent to
86.07 pence per euro. It touched 86.33 pence on July 4, the
weakest since April 17.  The policy decision was the first by the central bank since
Carney became governor on July 1. The nine-member Monetary
Policy Committee kept its  bond-buying   target  at 375 billion
pounds and the U.K.’s main  interest rate  at 0.5 percent.  BOE Statement  “The implied rise in the expected future path of  Bank Rate 
was not warranted by the recent developments in the domestic
economy,” the London-based central bank said in a statement.
The increase in market interest rates would weigh on the
nation’s economic outlook, it said.  Short-sterling futures rose, indicating traders were
reducing bets on higher rates. The implied yield on the contract
expiring in September 2014 fell seven basis points from June 28
to 0.72 percent.  The pound has weakened 1.8 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro gained 4.8 percent and the dollar
strengthened 8.1 percent.  U.S. payrolls rose by 195,000 workers for a second month in
June, the Labor Department said in  Washington . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey projected a 165,000 gain.  Ten-year gilt  yields  rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, this week to 2.49 percent. The 1.75 percent
security due in September 2022 fell 0.32, or 3.20 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount to 94.01. The rate reached 2.59 percent
on June 24, the  highest  since October 2011.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 1.4
billion pounds of inflation-linked gilts due in 2029 on July 9.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.1 percent this year
through July 4, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.2 percent and Treasuries declined 2.9
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
