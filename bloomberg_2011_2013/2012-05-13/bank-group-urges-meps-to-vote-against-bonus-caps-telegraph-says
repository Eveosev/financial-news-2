 Members of the Association for
Financial Markets in  Europe , a banking lobby group, are urging
the European Parliament to vote against bonus caps, the Sunday
Telegraph reported.  In a letter to the members of the Economic and Monetary
Affairs committee of the parliament, the group plead not to
support a resolution that will enact a 1:1 ratio of salary to
bonus, the newspaper said, citing the document.  The committee will tomorrow vote on amendments to the
Capital Requirements Directive and will probably pass the
resolution, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
