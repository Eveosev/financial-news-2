Chelsea is set to open talks with
Atletico  Madrid  over a move for the Spanish club’s Colombian
striker Radamel Falcao, the People reported.  Falcao, who scored twice in Atletico’s 3-0 win against
Athletic Bilbao in soccer’s Europa League final this week, is
valued at 40 million pounds ($64.3 million), the newspaper said.  Chelsea has made Falcao its top target because Real
Madrid’s Gonzalo Higuain is now considering a move to Paris
Saint-Germain, the People said, without citing anyone.   Madrid and Juventus may compete with Chelsea to sign
Falcao, the newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
