Embraer SA (EMBR3)  is in the bidding for an
order from  Warren Buffett ’s NetJets Inc., Ernest Edwards,
president of Embraer’s Executive Jets unit said today. NetJets
sent out a request for proposals to manufacturers that asked for
“anything from 25 aircraft upwards,” he said.  “We submitted our proposals several months ago. We are
waiting to hear from them as a result of the submission of
proposals,” Edwards said in an interview today in Geneva. “I
know a couple of competitors have been advised that they are no
longer involved, but we have not been advised that we are not
involved, so we are assume we are still involved,” he said.  NetJets Europe Chief Executive Officer Eric Connor said in
an interview today that the fractional jet operator was in
negotiations for a “substantial” order of mid-size aircraft to
replace Hawker 800 and Falcon planes. The order may include both
firm orders and options, Connor said,  “We are not in the starting phase, we are a fair way
through the process,” Connor said. He didn’t comment on the
timing of the order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
