Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s fuel oil
consumption increased more than fourfold in April as the company
relies more on thermal power generation after the Fukushima
nuclear disaster.  The utility known as Tepco consumed 541,000 kiloliters (3.4
million barrels) of fuel oil last month, up from 120,000
kiloliters in the same period last year, according to data
released on its  website . Tepco’s crude oil consumption more than
doubled to 193,000 kiloliters while liquefied natural gas use
rose 15.1 percent to 1.9 million metric tons, it said.  Tepco and other regional utilities have been forced to turn
to coal, oil and gas-fired plants as all of  Japan ’s 50 nuclear
reactors remain shut with no date set to restart any of them.  The following table shows Tepco’s consumption and purchases
of  fuel oil , crude, LNG and coal for April. For fuel oil and
crude, the volume is in kiloliters while LNG and coal are in
metric tons.
