Israeli shares  traded in New York
posted the longest stretch of weekly declines in 2012 after
revenue missed analysts’ estimates at  Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  and Given Imaging Ltd.  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Israeli stocks in the U.S. fell for a  third week , retreating 1
percent to 87.16. Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, the world’s
largest maker of generic drugs, had the biggest weekly drop in
almost six months, while technology developer  EZchip (EZCH) 
Semiconductor Ltd. posted the biggest discount to Tel Aviv among
dually traded shares.  Teva reported sales that missed the median forecast of 18
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg on May 9 as earnings from  Europe 
declined. Given’s revenue fell $1.5 million short of the average
estimate. EZchip tumbled the most in two weeks on May 10 after
Cisco Systems Inc., its biggest customer, said a global economic
slowdown will curb spending on computer-networking equipment.  The companies that reported earnings “have been slashed
this week,” Gadi Beer, the manager of Amidex35  Israel  Mutual
Fund, said by phone from New York on May 11. “Most of it is
uncertainty. It finally caught up with Israel.”  Israel’s  TA-25 benchmark gauge  slipped 0.6 percent in  Tel
Aviv  today.  Average sales per share for the 25 companies in the Israel-
US index will probably drop by half in the second  quarter of
2012, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Tension Over Greece  European and U.S. stocks fell last week as political
tension in  Greece  heightened concern about the region’s debt
crisis and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $2 billion trading loss
weighed on shares of banks.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  retreated 0.4 percent and has
fallen 7.5 percent since this year’s high on March 16. Greece’s
political impasse has raised the possibility another election
will have to be held as early as next month.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  sank to a two-month low
after JPMorgan said “egregious mistakes” and ‘sloppiness’’
caused losses for the firm.  Israeli stocks are being driven lower by “uncertainty in
Europe, the global economy, Greece and the U.S.,” Jacob de Tusch-Lec, a  fund manager  at Artemis Investment Management LLP,
said by phone from  London  on May 11.  European Sales Down  American depositary receipts of Teva slumped 5.9 percent to
$41.81 in New York, the sharpest weekly decline since Nov. 25.
The company’s  Tel Aviv shares  fell 2 percent to 158.7 shekels,
or the equivalent of $41.58.  Teva posted revenue of $5.1 billion in the first three
months of the year, compared with the  median estimate  of $5.5
billion from 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales in Europe
fell 2 percent to $1.32 billion while revenue jumped 46 percent
to $2.8 billion in the U.S., the company’s largest market, Teva
reported May 9.  Given Imaging Ltd. (GIVN) , the Yokneam, Israel-based biotechnology
company that makes pill-sized cameras, said sales grew 4.7
percent to $42 million in the first quarter, falling short of
the median  estimate  of $43.5 million from three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Shares fell 6.4 percent in the week, the
most since August, to $17.76. The company’s Tel Aviv shares
gained 1.2 percent today to 68.90 shekels, or the equivalent of
$18.05.  Slower to Sign  EZchip, a maker of network processors that facilitate
faster transmission of voice and data, fell the most in two
weeks on May 10 and closed at $40.46 last week. Israel Shares of
the Yokneam, Israel-based company dropped 4.1 percent today to
156.3 shekels, or the equivalent of $40.96.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the world’s largest maker of computer-
networking equipment, made up 49 percent, or $7 million, of
EZchip’s revenue in the first quarter. San Jose, California-
based Cisco said May 9 that it’s taking longer to sign deals
with corporate customers because of a hesitant spending
environment.  Nice Systems Ltd. (NICE)  in Tel Aviv slid 1.4 percent to 143.8
shekels, or the equivalent of $37.68.  The company’s revenue rose to $210 million in the first
quarter, it said on May 9, compared with the median  estimate  of
$214.5 million from 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Prolor Biotech Inc. (PBTH)  dropped 3.9 percent today to 20.68
shekels, or the equivalent of $5.42 following a 7.9 percent
decline to $5.24 on May 11 in  New York . The developer of
therapeutic proteins said it priced an offering of 6.5 million
shares at $5 each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
