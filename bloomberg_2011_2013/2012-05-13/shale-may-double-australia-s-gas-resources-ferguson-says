Australia is likely to possess vast
areas of shale that may double the country’s gas resources,
according to a report released today by Resources and Energy
Minister Martin Ferguson.  “This report reconfirms Australia’s capacity to continue
to be a major gas exporter supplying the world’s growing
demand” for the fuel well into the future, Ferguson said in a
statement. The nation has enough identified resources, excluding
shale, to maintain current production rates for 184 years, the
report said.  ConocoPhillips (COP) ,  BG Group Plc (BG/) ,  Hess Corp. (HES)  and  Mitsubishi
Corp. (8058)  have already agreed to fund shale exploration campaigns
through ventures in Australia. With an estimated 400 trillion
cubic feet of recoverable shale-gas resources, the country is
poised to commercialize its holdings on a “large scale,”
according to a report last year by the U.S. Energy Information
Administration.  Australia may double its gas resources through the
exploitation of shale, although exploration has only recently
commenced and the commodity is poorly understood, Ferguson said.
The nation may have “significant” areas of shale,
predominately located in central Australia, the report showed.  The report is titled Australian Gas Resources Assessment
2012 and was prepared by Geoscience  Australia  in conjunction
with the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
