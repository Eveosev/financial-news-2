Peter Cohen, chief executive officer
of PHS Group Plc, left the U.K. washroom services company after
14 years, PHS said.  John Skidmore, group finance director, is acting as interim
CEO, with a selection process for the new chief “at an advanced
stage,” the company said today in an e-mailed response to
questions from Bloomberg.  Cohen, who owns 10 percent of the company, left in March, a
month after PHS owner Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP scrapped
plans to sell it for about 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion),
the Sunday Telegraph reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
