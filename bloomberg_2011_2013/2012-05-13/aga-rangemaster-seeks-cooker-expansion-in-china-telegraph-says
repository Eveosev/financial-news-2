AGA Rangemaster Group Plc (AGA) , a U.K.
range-cooker and kitchen company, plans to expand in China as it
starts a service allowing users to control stoves remotely from
a mobile phone or a laptop, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  The company is seeking to get more than half of its sales
from outside the U.K., compared to 37 percent now, the newspaper
said, citing William McGrath, chief executive officer of AGA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
