The Australian government offered 27
areas for oil and gas exploration off the coasts of the  Northern
Territory , Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and
Tasmania, Energy Minister  Martin Ferguson  said.  “There is a high probability of major new petroleum
discoveries in Australian waters, with a large number of
sedimentary basins still to be explored,” Ferguson said in
speech notes for a conference delivered today in Adelaide.  Ferguson also said the petroleum industry plans to set up a
system for capping wells to stop potential oil leaks after the
2009 Montara oil spill in the Timor Sea. The government
separately is considering strengthening laws to make companies
pay for the costs of the pollution they cause, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
