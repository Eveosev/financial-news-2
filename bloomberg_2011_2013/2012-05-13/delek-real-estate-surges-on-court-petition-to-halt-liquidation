  Delek Real Estate Ltd. (DLKR)  shares and
bonds surged after an Israeli court delayed by 48 hours a
liquidation process so that bondholders could reconvene for
talks on a debt settlement.  The  shares  of the Ramat-Gan, Israel-based company surged 21
percent, the biggest gain since Nov. 20, to 0.19 shekel at the
4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. That gives the company a market
value of 73.6 million shekels ($19 million) compared with about
200 million shekels a year ago. Delek’s 4.8 percent bonds due
February 2019 rose 24 percent to 26.23 agorot on the shekel, the
highest since May 1.  Delek Real Estate, controlled by Isaac Tshuva, asked the
Tel Aviv District Court to halt the company’s liquidation
process and to reconvene bondholders for talks on a debt
settlement, according to a filing to the  Tel Aviv  Stock Exchange
today. The court gave the sides until 11 a.m. on May 15. to
complete their negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
