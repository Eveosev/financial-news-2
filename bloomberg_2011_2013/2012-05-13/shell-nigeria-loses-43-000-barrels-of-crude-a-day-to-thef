The Shell Petroleum Development Co.
of Nigeria Ltd. said it’s losing at least 43,000 barrels of
crude oil a day to theft.  Most of the theft targets the Nembe Creek Trunkline and the
Trans Niger Pipeline, the company’s major pipelines in eastern
 Niger Delta , the Nigeria unit of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The company said it closed the Nembe Creek line May 2 to
remove more than 50 illegal bunkering points. Last year, oil
spills caused by sabotage and theft accounted for 77 percent of
total spilled volume, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
