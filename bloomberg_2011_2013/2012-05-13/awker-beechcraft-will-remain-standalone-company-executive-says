(Corrects to remove erroneous attribution in third
paragraph.)  Hawker Beechcraft Inc., the business
jet-maker which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 3, will
remain intact, Executive Vice President Shawn Vick said.  “This is not chapter 7, this is not the break-up of the
company,” Vick said at a press conference in Geneva today. It
is “highly likely” that the maker of Beechcraft King Air
turboprops and Hawker 4000 and 900XP jets will exit Chapter 11
before the year end, Vick said, citing the firm’s financial
advisers. Vick also said other companies may be interested in
acquiring Hawker Beechcraft.  Wichita, Kansas-based Hawker was bought for $3.3 billion in
2007 by  Goldman Sach Group Inc. (GS)  and  Onex Corp. (OCX)  The jet-maker
filed for bankruptcy on May 3 as crippling debts incurred from
the company’s takeover combined with stalling corporate jet
sales. Two-thirds of the 2007 purchase was financed with debt,
Vick said. The company reported net losses totalling more than
$900 million in the past two years as U.S. military contracts
and plane sales declined.  Goldman Sachs and Onex announced a plan earlier this month
to transfer their equity to holders of Hawker’s debt,
eliminating $2.5 billion in borrowings in the process. Hawker
now has “no debt impairments,” Vick said, and is freed from
$125 million of annual interest payments.  Hawker competes with Cessna Aircraft Co,  Embraer SA (EMBR3) ,
Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. and  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  to supply
 business jets  in the mid- and light-aircraft categories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
