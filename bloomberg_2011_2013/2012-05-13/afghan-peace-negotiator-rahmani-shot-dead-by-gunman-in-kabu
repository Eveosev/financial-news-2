Arsala Rahmani, a senior member of
President Hamid Karzai’s High Peace Council, was shot dead by a
gunman in the Afghan capital, Kabul.  Rahmani was on his way to his office today when he was shot
from a vehicle, Hashmatullah Stanekzai, a Kabul police spokesman
said by telephone. “We don’t know who the assailants were, and
it’s being investigated,” he said.  The killing is another blow to Karzai’s peace efforts with
the Taliban following the death last November of the peace
council’s chief,  Burhanuddin Rabbani , in a suicide bombing at
his home.  “The death of Mr Rahmani could majorly affect our work
toward peace as he had good contacts with Taliban” which could
help bring them in the negotiating table, peace council member
Ismayel Qasemyar said. “Today’s attack will complicate our
peace efforts.”  Zabihullah Mujahed, a Taliban spokesman, said in a text
message to reporters that the group was not responsible for
Rahmani’s death.  To contact the reporter on this story:
