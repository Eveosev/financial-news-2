Sales at U.S. retailers probably
slowed in April as the weather turned more seasonable and
consumers took a breather following a pre-Easter holiday buying
spree, economists said before a report this week.  The projected 0.2 percent gain in purchases would follow a
0.8 percent advance in March, according to the  median  forecast
of 68 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News ahead of Commerce
Department figures on May 15. Other data may show increases in
the cost of living eased, home construction stabilized and
manufacturing picked up.  Demand at building material, clothing and even furniture
stores probably suffered last month compared with a weather-
induced gain in the first three months of 2012, the warmest on
record. Smaller employment gains may also make it more difficult
for consumer spending to match last quarter’s advance, the
biggest in more than a year.  “Households are still spending at a fairly healthy clip --
not at a spectacular rate,” said  Paul Dales , a senior U.S.
economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in  London . “Things aren’t
too bad at the moment.”  Retailers’ same-store sales trailed analysts’ estimates in
April for the first time since November, according to industry
data. Sales at  Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-biggest U.S. discount
chain, rose 1.1 percent, falling short of a 2.9 percent
projection.  Part of that slowdown may reflect seasonal events that
pulled sales into the previous month. The average temperature in
March was the warmest on record, and Easter fell on April 8
compared with April 24 in 2011.  Influence on Growth  The retail sales category used to calculate gross domestic
product, which excludes auto dealers, building material stores
and service stations, will show a 0.4 percent gain in April, the
same as the prior month, according to economists surveyed.  Consumer spending , which accounts for 70 percent of the
economy, grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter,
the most since the last three months of 2010, according to data
from the Commerce Department.  Weaker job creation threatens consumers’ ability to sustain
spending at such levels. Employers took on 115,000 workers last
month, the fewest since October, according to a May 4 Labor
Department report. The jobless rate fell as people left the work
force.  Less expensive gasoline will free up some cash for other
goods and services. The average price of a gallon of regular gas
fell to $3.73 on May 10 from a peak this year of $3.94 in early
April, according to AAA, the nation’s largest auto club.  Less Inflation  The decline in fuel costs is also showing up in measures of
inflation. The consumer-price index was little changed in April
after climbing 0.3 percent the prior month, according to the
survey median before a Labor Department report May 15. Prices
rose 2.3 percent over the past year, down from 2.7 percent in
March.  Receding inflation is one reason Federal Reserve policy
makers have indicated they see no need to raise borrowing costs.
On May 16, the  Federal Open Market Committee  will issue minutes
from its April 24-25 meeting, during which officials repeated
their view that  interest rates  are likely to remain
“exceptionally low” at least through late 2014.  Improvements in the housing market, which has been a drag
on the expansion, would give central bankers reason to revise
those plans. A May 16 report from the Commerce Department will
probably show builders began work on homes at a 685,000 annual
rate in April, up from 654,000 the prior month, according to the
Bloomberg median forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite  Homebuilding Index (S15HOME)  has
jumped 37 percent since the end of last year, beating the 7.6
percent gain in the broader  S&P 500 .  Manufacturing remains at the forefront of the expansion.
Production at the nation’s factories, mines and utilities
probably rose 0.6 percent in April after being little changed in
the previous two months, economists projected a Fed report May
16 will show.  *  Bloomberg Survey  ================================================================  Release    Period    Prior     Median
