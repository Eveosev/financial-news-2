Spanish support for the ruling
 People’s Party  declined for a second month, according to a
Metroscopia opinion poll published by  El Pais .  The People’s Party of Rajoy saw its support slip to 37.2
percent in May from 38.1 percent in month earlier, while the
Socialists rose to 25.8 percent from 23 percent.  A total of 68 percent of the respondents were against
bailing out banks with public fund, El Pais said.  The survey, based on 1,000 interviews conducted on May 9
and 10, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
