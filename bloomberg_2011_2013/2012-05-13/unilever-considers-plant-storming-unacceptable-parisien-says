The storming of a  Unilever (UNA)  plant in
 France  by fired employees is “unacceptable,” Bruno Witvoet,
the head of Unilever for France, told  Le Parisien .  Former employees stormed the Fralib plant in Gemenos,
southern France, early on May 11, and have occupied the site
ever since to protest its closure, Le Parisien said. Fralib is a
unit of Unilever, according to the newspaper.  French authorities have approved the closure of the plant,
which made  Lipton teas  and Elephant infusions and employed 182
people, according to Le Parisien.  To contact the reporter on this story:
