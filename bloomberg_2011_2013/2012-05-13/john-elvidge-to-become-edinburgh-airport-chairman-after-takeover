Global Infrastructure Partners , the
fund run by General Electric Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG,
said John Elvidge will become Edinburgh airportâ€™s chairman once
the 807.2 million-pound ($1.3 billion) acquisition of the
facility completes at the end of the month.  Elvidge retired from the U.K. civil service in 2010
following seven years as the permanent secretary to the Scottish
government, where his duties included dealing with transport,
economic development and infrastructure issues, according to an
e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
