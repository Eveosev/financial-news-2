 Lenders may have to charge customers
more because of the cost of separating investment banking and
retail operations, the  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  Chairman
Philip Hampton told the Sunday Telegraph.  The banks will probably pass on the cost to customers as
the government forces lenders to split their “risky”
investment banking from retail units, Hampton said in an
interview, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
