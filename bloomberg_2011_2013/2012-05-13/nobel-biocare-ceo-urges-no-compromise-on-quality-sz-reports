Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  had some
“quality issues” in the first quarter,  SonntagsZeitung 
reported, citing an internal e-mail from Chief Executive Officer
Richard Laube.  The company can never make compromises on quality of its
products, Laube said in the e-mail, according to the newspaper.
The cases referred to in the e-mail concern the prosthetics
division rather than dental implants, the newspaper cited
Nicolas Weidmann, a spokesman for Nobel Biocare, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
