Helen Zille ,  South Africa ’s main
opposition leader, said the Western Cape province she governs
won’t cancel a communications contract as recommended by the
country’s Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.  The participation of two of Zille’s advisers made the
tender process which gave a contract to develop a branding
strategy for the province to advertising agency TBWA Hunt
Lascaris “unlawful,” the Johannesburg-based Sunday Times said
today, citing a report by Madonsela.  “The argument for terminating the contract cannot be
legally sustained,” because government regulations don’t bar
special advisers from participating in bid evaluations, Zille
said in an e-mailed statement today, citing her legal counsel.
“The Western Cape government does not have the legal power to
terminate the contract.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
