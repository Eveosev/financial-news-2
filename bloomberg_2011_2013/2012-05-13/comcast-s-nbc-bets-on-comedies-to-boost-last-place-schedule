NBC, last in total viewers among the
major TV networks, announced seven new comedies next season,
including “Animal Practice” and “Guys With Kids” from  Jimmy Fallon , in the second full schedule under owner  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   NBC will air comedies four nights a week during the season
starting in September, the New York-based network said yesterday
in an e-mailed statement.  Robert Greenblatt , chairman of NBC
Entertainment, presents the full schedule today at Radio City
Music Hall in New York.  The network made a conscious decision to develop more
comedies as the genre proved in recent years to attract big
audiences, Greenblatt said in an interview yesterday. NBC needs
to bolster a prime-time lineup that averages a third fewer
viewers than leader CBS, according to Nielsen data. Older shows
such as “30 Rock” and “The Office” anchor NBC’s comedy line-
up.  “The more comedy, the better,” Greenblatt said. “We’re
in a process of re-invigoration. You’ll see more comedy
development from us this season and next season.”  Other comedies joining the schedule include “Go On,” with
 Matthew Perry  as a sportscaster, and “The New Normal” from
“Glee” creator Ryan Murphy, NBC said in the statement. Mid-
season sitcoms include “1600 Penn,” “Save Me” and Dane Cook’s “Next Caller.”  “The Voice,” the network’s most popular program after
“Sunday Night Football,” will start on Mondays in September,
with an additional hour of the show airing on Tuesdays.  $1.66 Billion Commitment  NBC will collect $1.66 billion in ad commitments for next
season, the least of the big four,  Spencer Wang , an analyst at
Credit Suisse in New York, estimated in a May 11 report.  The network renewed “The Office,” “Smash,” “Grimm”
and “Whitney,” NBC said. Critically acclaimed comedy “30
Rock” with  Tina Fey  and  Alec Baldwin  will enter its seventh and
last season. “Bent,” “Are You There, Chelsea?” and “Awake”
were canceled.  “Guys with Kids” follows men in their 30s who struggle as
parents because they are still children at heart. The show
features Zach Cregger, Jesse Bradford and Anthony Anderson,
along with Jamie Lynn Sigler of “The Sopranos.” In “Next
Caller,” Cook plays an alpha-male DJ who hosts a show on
satellite radio with a feminist co-host.  “1600 Penn,” about a first family living in the White
House, stars Bill Pullman and Jenna Elfman, while “Animal
Practice” features Justin Kirk of “Weeds” as a veterinarian
who loves animals more than their owners.  Network Lineups  The networks are releasing their 2012-2013 schedules in so-
called upfront meetings with advertisers to book advance
commitments for the new season.  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox releases its
lineup today, while  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC unveils its plans
tomorrow.  CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched TV network, will
reveal its prime-time changes on May 16.  NBC, while last in the Nielsen ratings, is the only major
network to lift its total audience this season and add viewers
ages 18 to 49, the group prized by marketers. Its February Super
Bowl telecast drew a record 111.3 million viewers.  The network has averaged 7.43 million total viewers a night
in prime time this season, 4.6 percent more a year ago, and 3.2
million viewers in the demographic, a 4.2 percent increase,
according to Nielsen data.  “Sunday Night Football” and “The Voice” are NBC’s only
top 10 shows in 18 to 49, according to Nielsen data.  The network invested heavily in promoting “Smash” and
“Whitney” before the shows started in January. “30 Rock”
will end after 13 episodes, NBC said. The show won the Emmy
award for best comedy series in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  J.J. Abrams, Dick Wolf  “Community,” the low-rated, critically acclaimed comedy
series starring Joel McHale and  Chevy Chase  as community college
students, was given a 13-episode order.  NBC also ordered dramas “Revolution” from  J.J. Abrams  and
“Chicago Fire,” from  Dick Wolf , creator of the network’s “ Law
& Order ” franchise. “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,”
starring Mariska Hargitay, will return for a 14th season. The
network will also bring back “Parenthood” for a fourth season.  New mid-season dramas include “Do No Harm,” about a
brilliant neurosurgeon played by Steven Pasquale with a
dangerous alter-ego that threatens his personal and professional
life. The network ordered “Hannibal” and “Infamous,” where
an undercover detective infiltrates a wealthy family as the
maid’s daughter to solve the murder of an heiress.  New reality shows include “Stars Earn Stripes,” “Howie Mandel’s White Elephant,” “Ready for Love,” and “Surprise
with Jenny McCarthy,” NBC said in the statement. The network
also renewed “The Celebrity Apprentice,” “Fashion Star,”
“The Biggest Loser” and “Betty White’s Off Their Rockers.”  “Dateline NBC” and “Rock Center with  Brian Williams ”
will return next season, the network said.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, fell 0.8 percent to $29.38
on May 11 in  New York . The stock has climbed 24 percent this
year before today.  NBC FALL 2012-2013 SCHEDULE
