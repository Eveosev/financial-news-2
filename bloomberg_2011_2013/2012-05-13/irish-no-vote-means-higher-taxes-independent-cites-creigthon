Ireland risks increased unemployment,
higher taxes and isolation if it votes “no” to the European
fiscal treaty, the Sunday Independent said, citing the country’s
European Affairs Minister Lucinda Creighton.  A rejection in a May 31 referendum would “choke
confidence, choke growth and employment; you will have higher
taxes and lose jobs,” the newspaper cited Creighton as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
