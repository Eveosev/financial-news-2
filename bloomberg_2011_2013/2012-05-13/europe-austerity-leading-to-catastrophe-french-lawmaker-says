Austerity measures in the European
Union are leading the region to a “catastrophe,” according to
French Socialist lawmaker Arnaud Montebourg.  “Austerity is everywhere and it’s a complete shipwreck,”
Montebourg said in an interview on BFMTV today.  President-elect Francois Hollande will meet German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  on May 15, the day of his inauguration,
to try and overcome her skepticism to stimulus spending to
counter a contraction in the euro economy this year.  The measures Hollande will propose to Germany are
“innovative” and are starting to find “an echo everywhere in
 Europe ,” Montebourg said. “There is a debate in Germany, in
Spain, in  Italy , in the whole world.”  Merkel’s party was defeated today in its worst result since
World War II in elections in Germany’s most populous state that
saw the  Social Democrats  extend their influence across the
country’s regions. The result may embolden the Social Democrats
as they align with Hollande in an anti-austerity front pressing
for steps to spur economic growth to counter the crisis.  “Even in Germany, people are tired of austerity,”
Montebourg said. “Madame Merkel herself is experiencing
electoral difficulties. All countries need growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
