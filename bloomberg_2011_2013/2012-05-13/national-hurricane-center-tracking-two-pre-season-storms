The  National Hurricane Center  is
tracking two pre-season storms in the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans today.  The stronger of the two is located in the Pacific about 550
miles (885 kilometers) south-southwest of  Acapulco , Mexico and
has a 50 percent chance of becoming a tropical depression in the
next day or two, according to a bulletin from the center in
Miami.  The other storm that has caught the eye of forecasters is
460 miles west-southwest of the Azores in the Atlantic, a
bulletin said. That system has a 20 percent chance of becoming a
sub-tropical storm in the next two days.  The systems have developed prior to the official start of
both the eastern Pacific and Atlantic hurricane seasons. The
eastern Pacific season starts on May 15 and the Atlantic begins
on June 1.  Eastern Pacific storms can threaten the coast of  Mexico  and
Central America, causing life threatening flooding. In the
Atlantic, storms can enter the  Gulf of Mexico , potentially
damaging natural gas and oil interests there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
