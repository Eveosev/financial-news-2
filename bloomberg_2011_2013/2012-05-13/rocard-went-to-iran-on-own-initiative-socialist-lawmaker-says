Former French Prime Minister Michel Rocard went to  Iran  for a private visit, not at the request of
President-elect Francois Hollande, according to a Socialist
lawmaker.  Rocard was received yesterday by Iranian Defense Minister
Ali Akbar Salehi while in the country for a three-day visit, Le
Figaro  reported  today in its Website.  “It was a purely individual initiative,” Socialist
lawmaker Arnaud Montebourg said in an interview on  BFMTV  today,
adding that he doesn’t know whether the Socialist Party will
sanction Rocard for the trip.  Jean-Francois Cope, who heads outgoing President  Nicolas
Sarkozy ’s  Union for a Popular Movement  party, said today he
wants Hollande to clarify his position on Iran.  “I don’t know what a private initiative is,” Cope said
today in an interview on the France Inter radio station.  Rocard “is close to  Francois Hollande ,” Cope said. “Now
we discover he’s received with all the honors by Iranian
leaders. I can’t believe Rocard did this in total disconnect
with Hollande.”  Rocard served as prime minister under President  Francois Mitterrand  from 1988 to 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
