Administrators to Rangers Football
Club Plc said it accepted an offer to purchase the club from
former Sheffield United chief executive Charles Green.  A group, led by Green, has secured a period of exclusivity
to complete the purchase which should be finalised at a meeting
of creditors on June 6, said administrators Duff and Phelps in a
statement today on the Glasgow-based football clubs website.  “The structure and quantum of the offer from Mr Green is
such that it is acceptable to us as administrators and, having
been in discussions with major creditors throughout the process,
we believe this presents the best prospect of financial recovery
for creditors,” said Duff and Phelps joint administrator David
Whitehouse.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
