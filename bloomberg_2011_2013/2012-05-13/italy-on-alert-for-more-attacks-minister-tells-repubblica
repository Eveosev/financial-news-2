Italy  is on maximum alert for
terrorism after recent attacks targeting the tax-collection
agency Equitalia and the shooting of Ansaldo Nucleare Chief
Executive Officer Roberto Adinolfi, la Repubblica reported,
citing Interior Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri.  Thirty anarchists are the focus of investigators and the
army is committed to defending vulnerable targets, Cancellieri
told Repubblica. Her comments come after two Molotov cocktails
were placed outside Equitalia’s headquarters in Livorno, Italy
yesterday, with one exploding, Repubblica reported.  That follows the discovery of a parcel bomb at Equitalia’s
Rome headquarters on May 11, news service Ansa reported.
Adinolfi was shot in the legs by two assailants on a scooter in
Genoa on May 7, Repubblica reported then, describing the injury
as non life-threatening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
