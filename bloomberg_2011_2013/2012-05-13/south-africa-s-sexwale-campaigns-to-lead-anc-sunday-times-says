South African Human Settlements
Minister Tokyo Sexwale plans to challenge President  Jacob Zuma 
for the position of leader of the ruling  African National
Congress  in December, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing
unidentified members of his campaign.  The campaigners plan to install current secretary-general
Gwede Mantashe as deputy president and Deputy Sports Minister
Fikile Mbalula as secretary-general, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said today. The members declined to be identified
because campaigning for party positions hasn’t officially
started.  “At the right time, upon the appropriate platform, the
minister will make his views abundantly clear,” Sexwale’s
spokesman Xolani Xundu is quoted by the Sunday Times as saying.
Xundu did not immediately answer calls and a message left on his
mobile phone by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
