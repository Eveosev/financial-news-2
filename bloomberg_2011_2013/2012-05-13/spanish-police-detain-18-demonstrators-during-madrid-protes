Spanish police made 18 arrests,
mostly for public order offences, in Madrid during protests
repeated across the country over economic discontent, the
 Interior Ministry  said.  Moves to dissolve the protest in Puerta del Sol, in
downtown Madrid, ended earlier today, the ministry said. The
deadline to end the protest had been 10 p.m. yesterday, Europa
Press reported.  About 72,000 protesters took to the streets across Spain
yesterday, including 30,000 in Barcelona and 22,000 in Madrid,
the  Associated Press  said, citing police. There were other
protests in Bilbao, Malaga and Seville, AP reported.  The protests commemorated the anniversary of last yearâ€™s
demonstrations against youth  unemployment  and the handling of
the international financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
