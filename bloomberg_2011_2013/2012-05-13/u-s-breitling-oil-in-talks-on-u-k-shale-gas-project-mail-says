Breitling Oil and Gas Corp., an
independent U.S. energy producer, has held talks with Cuadrilla
Resources Ltd. on mining shale gas near Blackpool in northern
 England , the Mail on Sunday reported, citing the companies.  The U.K. is “still a frontier play” and it may take eight
to 10 years to exploit the country’s reserves, the newspaper
reported, citing Chris Faulkner, chief executive officer of
Breitling Oil. The company is looking at Britain, he said,
according to the newspaper.  Cuadrilla, which suspended drilling in northwest England
after causing minor earthquakes, said May 10 it expects to
resume work this year and gas production may start in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
