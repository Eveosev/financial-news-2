The euro dropped to its lowest level
in almost four months against the dollar as a leadership vacuum
in  Greece  prompted European officials to weigh prospects for the
currency union’s first departure of a member state.  The 17-nation currency slid for a second day versus the yen
as Moody’s Investors Service cut the credit ratings of 26
Italian banks. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  rose for an 11th day and the
pound climbed to the highest versus the euro since 2008 as
investors sought haven.  Australia ’s currency fell below parity
with the greenback for the first time this year, and  Brazil ’s
real weakened to 2 per dollar for the first time since 2009.  “The problem is that Europe has a lot of flashpoints right
now, and Greece is only one of them,” said  Marc Chandler ,
global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman &
Co. in New York. “The Greek people want to stay inside the  euro
zone , but the government wants to renegotiate the fiscal pact.”  The euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.2823 at 5 p.m. in  New York 
after sliding to $1.2821, the weakest level since Jan. 18. The
currency declined 0.8 percent to 102.39 yen and reached 102.23,
the lowest since Feb. 16. The yen gained 0.1 percent to 79.85
per dollar.  The Italian banks downgraded included Unicredit SpA and
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA. Moody’s cited weakened earnings and the
country’s economic prospects.  Dollar Index, Treasuries  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, gained 0.5 percent to 80.693. U.S. 10-year
note yields slid to as low as 1.76 percent, the least since Oct.
4, as investors sought haven.  Alexis Tsipras, who heads Greece’s anti-bailout Syriza
party, wouldn’t attend a meeting called by President Karolos Papoulias today, the Athens-based party said in a statement.
Syriza rejected a unity government last week following
inconclusive elections on May 6. Greece may face another vote
unless leaders can agree on a new coalition.  “This puts the whole election back in doubt and suggests
that we’re going to have a second election sometime in the
middle of June,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research
at the online currency trader GFT Forex in New York. “We may
come to a fiscal crisis point before we have a political
resolution. All of that is pressing the euro down right now.”  Finance Ministers  The euro region’s finance ministers met today in Brussels.
Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who heads the group, said a
Greek exit from the currency union wasn’t discussed and that
euro nations remain committed to Greece.  The euro also weakened after the EU’s statistics office
said  industrial production  in the region contracted in March.  Brown Brothers Harriman’s Chandler said he expects the euro
to weaken to $1.27 by June and $1.24 in the third quarter.  Sterling rallied against all of its 16 most-traded peers as
investors sought an alternative to the shared currency. The
pound gained as much as 0.9 percent to 79.63 pence per euro, the
most since November 2008, before trading at 79.69 pence. It fell
0.1 percent to $1.6092.  Europe ’s shared currency dropped 4 percent in the past six
months, the worst performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
rose 2 percent, and the yen lost 2 percent.  Aussie Weakens  Australia’s dollar dropped below parity with its U.S.
counterpart for the first time since Dec. 20 as appetite for
higher-yielding currencies shrank. The Aussie declined 0.6
percent to 99.58 U.S. cents.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1.1 percent, and the
S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials also sank 1.1 percent.  The Brazilian, Swedish and South African currencies were
among the biggest losers against the greenback.  Sweden’s krona slid as much as 1.4 percent to 7.0538 per
dollar, the weakest since November 2010, before trading at
7.0532.  South Africa ’s rand dropped 1.4 percent to 8.2082, and
reached 8.2100, the least since Jan. 13.  Brazil’s real weakened as much as 2 percent to 2.0062 per
dollar, the least since July 2009, before trading at 1.9962.  To contact the reporter on this story:
