Egypt  agreed to export 1,261 metric
tons of cotton in the week through May 10, the Alexandria Cotton
Exporters Association said today in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 73,421 tons of cotton valued at
$230.9 million since the marketing year began Sept. 1. Of last
week’s sales, Egypt will ship 470 tons of the Giza 88 cotton
variety, 75 tons of Giza 45, 325 tons of Giza 90 and 391 tons of
Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-end clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are
the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
