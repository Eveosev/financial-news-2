Cookson Group Plc (CKSN)  has tried to defuse
discontent over senior executive pay by urging shareholders to
support all resolutions at a May 18 annual meeting, the Sunday
Times reported, citing letters sent out last week.  The company’s top three executives received shares worth 20
million pounds ($32.2 million) in March as part of long-term
incentives, angering some investors.  The  Association of British Insurers  issued its strongest
warning for breach of corporate governance rule for the
company’s pay report, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
