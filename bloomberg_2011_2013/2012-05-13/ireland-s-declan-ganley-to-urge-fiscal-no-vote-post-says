Ireland’s Declan Ganley, who led the
country’s campaign against the Lisbon Treaty in 2008, is to join
the ‘no’ side in a May 31 referendum on the European fiscal
treaty, the  Sunday Business Post  reported.  Supporting the treaty while it didn’t cut Ireland’s bank
debt is “beyond unacceptable,” Ganley wrote in the Dublin-
based paper today, adding that he would urge voters to reject
the treaty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
