Andy Pettitte  allowed four runs on
seven hits and three walks in 6 1/3 innings in his first mound
appearance for the  New York Yankees  since 2010.  Pettitte, 39, ended his one-season retirement in March and
had been pitching in the Yankees’ minor-league organization
until today, when he started against the Seattle Mariners.  Pettitte, who has a 240-138 career record and whose 203
wins for the Yankees are third most in franchise history, held
the Mariners hitless until the fourth inning before Justin Smoak
hit a two-run homer at Yankee Stadium. Casper Wells added
another two-run homer in the sixth off Pettitte.  Seattle starter Kevin Millwood held the Yankees to one run
on three hits in the first six innings, and the Mariners led 4-1
when Pettitte left the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
