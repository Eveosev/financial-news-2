Emirates Integrated
Telecommunications Co. (DU) , known as Du, is studying the possibility
of expanding to  Saudi Arabia  as a mobile virtual network
operator, the Chief Executive Officer said.  “We are open to any opportunity in the changing world of
telecom,” said Osman Sultan in a phone interview today. “We
keep our eyes open and in this respect we are looking at any
opportunity including MVNOs in any country. We study this but no
decision has been taken so far.”  As neighboring Saudi Arabia plans to issue three MVNO
licenses this year, Du is “looking at” that opportunity, the
CEO said. It is “premature to comment, even if we decide to bid
or not” he said. “We are studying that, like we will study any
other opportunities.” MVNO operators do not have their own
telecommunications infrastructure and typically rely on other
carriers’ networks to serve customers.  Du has been focused on its home market, the  United Arab
Emirates  since operations began in 2007. It has not changed its
stance on entering new markets as a “full-fledged telecom
operator,” Sultan said, adding there was no time frame for when
the company might venture abroad.  Du competes with  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT) , also
known as Etisalat, and has gained market share in the U.A.E.,
the second-biggest Arab economy, since 2007.  Du shares  closed 2.6 percent lower today, giving the
company a market value of 13.9 billion dirhams ($3.8 billion).
The stock has gained 5.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
