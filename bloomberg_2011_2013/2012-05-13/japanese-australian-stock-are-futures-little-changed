Asian  stocks  fell as speculation
heightened Greece may exit from the single European currency,
countering China’s efforts to shore up economic growth by
cutting the level of cash banks must set aside as reserves.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (6954) , a glassmaker that counts  Europe  as
its No. 1 market, slid 3 percent in  Tokyo .  China Longyuan Power
Group Corp. (916) , a wind-farm operator, sank 11 percent in Hong Kong
after saying it plans to issue new shares. NCSoft Corp., an
online-game maker, dropped 12 percent before the release of a
new game by its rival.  “Investors find it hard to move with uncertainty over
Europe, especially Greece,” said Takuya Yamada, a Tokyo-based
senior portfolio manager at ITC Investment Partners Corp., which
oversees about $750 million. “China’s reserve ratio cut is a
plus for investor mindsets, but the market isn’t reacting much
because its impact on the economy is limited.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 0.7 percent to 117.83 as
of 7:16 p.m. in Tokyo, after rising as much as 0.2 percent.
About two stocks fell for each that rose on the measure, which
dropped 4.4 percent last week, its biggest such decline in five
months, as inconclusive elections in Greece stoked concern that
efforts to halt Europe’s debt crisis will fail.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.2 percent and
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.3 percent. South Korea’s
 Kospi Index (KOSPI)  retreated 0.2 percent  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 1.2 percent, sliding
through the final two hours of trading after rising as much as
0.4 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.6
percent.  Annual Gain  The Asian regional index rose 4.2 percent this year through
May 11, compared with a 7.6 percent gain by the  S&P 500  and a 3
percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 12.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with a multiple of 12.9 for the S&P 500 and
10.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  Greece’s political deadlock looked set to continue for a
second week as President Karolos Papoulias failed to secure
agreement on a unity government.  Meetings brokered by Papoulias are set to continue today
after Syriza, the largest anti-bailout party, rejected a unity
government following last week’s inconclusive elections.  Greece’s withdrawal from the euro “is not necessarily
fatal, but it is not attractive,” European Central Bank
Governing Council member Patrick Honohan said on May 12.  Nippon Sheet Glass slid 3 percent to 96 yen and  Nissan
Motor Co. (7201) , which depends on Europe for about 16 percent of its
sales, fell 2 percent to 788 yen in Tokyo.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) ,
which operates a port in Greece, slipped 5.5 percent to HK$9.83
in Hong Kong.  U.S. Futures Drop  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1 percent
today, extending declines as the yield on 10-year Spanish debt
rose to 6.2 percent for the first time since Dec. 1. The S&P 500
slid 0.3 percent in  New York  May 11, declining for a second
week.  China Longyuan Power tumbled 11 percent to HK$5.21 in Hong
Kong, the second- biggest drop  in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index,
after saying it plans to issue no more than 1.36 billion new H-
shares, representing as much as 50 percent of total issued
shares.  NCsoft dropped 12 percent to 246,500 won in Seoul. Its
rival Blizzard Entertainment plans to release its Diablo III
game tomorrow.  The People’s Bank of  China  said May 12 that it is cutting
the amount of cash that banks must set aside as reserves for the
third time in six months, pumping money into the financial
system to support lending after data showed a slowdown in
economic growth is deepening. Reserve ratios will fall 50 basis
points, effective May 18.  NGK Jumps  “Where China sits is problematic at this stage,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “There’s going to be a camp
that says the cut in the banks’ reserve ratio is going to buoy
the economy and some investors saying the aggressive nature of
the move highlights growth is slowing more quickly than policy
makers would like.”  Among stocks that rose,  NGK Insulators Ltd. (5333) , a ceramic
maker, jumped 8.1 percent to 963 yen in Tokyo after the Nikkei
newspaper said the company plans to resume sodium-battery
production as early as July.  Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Co., a medicine maker, surged 15
percent to HK$11.88 in Hong Kong after saying its parent won
trademark arbitration. The stock has risen more than 50 percent
this month.  Celltrion Inc. (068270) , a biopharmaceutical company, surged for a
second day in Seoul, climbing 7 percent to 46,550 won in Seoul,
the biggest two-day advance since November 2008, after saying
the company will issue as many as 57.8 million bonus shares to
shareholders.  Westgold Resources Ltd. (WGR) , an Australian goldminer, surged 17
percent to 17.5 Australian cents in Sydney after saying it will
merge with a tin and nickel miner Metals X Ltd., which dropped
8.1 percent to 17 Australian cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
