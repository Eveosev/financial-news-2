Kuoni Reisen Holding AG (KUNN)  is holding
talks with its Greek business partners to prepare for a possible
exit of the country from the euro area, Chief Executive Officer
Peter Rothwell told  SonntagsZeitung  in an interview.  The company might introduce special clauses in contracts
with Greek hotels so it doesnâ€™t end up paying in euros if the
nation uses a cheaper currency, Rothwell told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
