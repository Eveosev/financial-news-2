Israeli benchmark  government bonds 
rose, pushing yields down for the 10th time in the last 11 days,
as concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis boosted demand for the
relative safety of government debt. Stocks fell.  The yield on the Mimshal Shiklit notes due January 2022
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.53
percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Two-year interest-
rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates in
the period, lost four basis points to 2.61 percent on May 11,
the lowest level since February. The TA-25 index declined 0.6
percent.  Global equities declined and U.S. Treasuries gained last
week as an inconclusive election in Greece left political
parties struggling to form a government. The impasse reignited
concern over  Greece ’s ability to meet the terms of its two
bailouts and the possibility the country will leave the euro.  “The crisis in Europe, which is worsening on the backdrop
of a political gridlock in Greece, has been boosting demand for
the safest assets,” said Moshik Yaniv, head of the local fixed-
income desk at Migdal Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv.
“Israeli debt is still seen as a safe investment, though of
course there are heightened budget concerns.”  Israel ’s budget deficit will probably widen to 3.4 percent
of gross domestic product in 2012 from 3.3 percent last year as
growth slows, the  International Monetary Fund  said on April 2.  Israel posted a seasonally-adjusted trade deficit of $1.86
billion in April, the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said on its website today. Exports declined to $3.66
billion, the lowest in at least a year.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, narrowed 3 basis points to 285, implying an
average annual inflation rate of 2.85 percent over the period.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, was little changed at 265.47.
The shekel weakened 0.1 percent to 3.8163 a dollar on May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
