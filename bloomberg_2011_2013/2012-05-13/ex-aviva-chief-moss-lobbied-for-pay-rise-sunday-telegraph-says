Aviva Plc (AV/) ’s former chief executive
officer Andrew Moss lobbied board members for a 9.5 percent pay
increase just weeks before his resignation, the  Sunday Telegraph 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  Moss, who resigned last week under pressure from
shareholders unhappy with Aviva’s falling share price during his
five years in charge, pressed board members to boost his basic
salary to 1.05 million pounds ($1.69 million) from 960,000
pounds, the newspaper said.  Andrew Haste, the former RSA Insurance Group Plc chief
executive officer seen by analysts as the favorite to replace
Moss, has told friends that he wouldn’t be interested in the
job, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
