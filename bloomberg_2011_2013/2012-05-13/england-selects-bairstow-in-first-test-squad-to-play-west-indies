Jonny Bairstow is set for his Test
debut after being included in England’s 13-man squad for the
opener of its three-match series against West Indies.  The 22-year-old Yorkshire batsman, who can also play as a
wicketkeeper, is called up after Essex’s  Ravi Bopara  suffered a
thigh injury this week.  “Jonny Bairstow has put in a number of impressive
performances both for England Lions and Yorkshire,” National
Selector Geoff Miller  said  on the England and Wales Cricket
Board’s website. “He is an exciting young player who now has an
opportunity to experience the Test environment.”  Bairstow, who has played six one-day internationals and six
Twenty20 matches for England, has a first-class average of
46.37. His father David played four Tests for England between
1979 and 1981.  Durham’s Graham Onions is one of five seamers selected,
with spinner Graeme Swann providing England’s other bowling
option. Onions, 29, played his last Test more than two years
ago.  England is also set to play three one-day matches and a
Twenty20 against West Indies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
