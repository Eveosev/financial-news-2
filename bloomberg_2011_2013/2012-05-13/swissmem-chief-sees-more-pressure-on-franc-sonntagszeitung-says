The Swissmem industry group head  Hans Hess  said pressure on the franc to appreciate grew after the
election results in Greece and  France , SonntagsZeitung reported.  Hess told the newspaper in an interview that he’s convinced
the Swiss central bank will be able to defend the currency
ceiling of 1.20 versus the euro. The central bank should use
“tactical and communication measures” to further weaken the
franc, he was cited as saying.  Swissmem is based in Zurich and represents the country’s
manufacturers of machinery and electronics as well as metal
processing companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
