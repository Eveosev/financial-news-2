Japan , Mexico and  Canada  may
participate in a Pacific-region trade accord, though they won’t
be able to alter any aspects of the deal that have already been
established, according to a senior U.S. negotiator.  There is still an opportunity for the three countries to
join, said the official, who spoke to reporters on background
from the sidelines of trade discussions near Dallas.  Representatives from nine countries are meeting this week
for the latest round of negotiations in the so-called Trans-
Pacific Partnership. The countries working toward a final
agreement with the U.S. are Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia,
 New Zealand , Peru,  Singapore  and Vietnam. Officials from Japan,
Mexico and Canada have expressed interest in joining as well.
Adding the three nations would create the largest such trade
agreement in U.S. history.  Existing participants in the talks are conducting their own
discussions with the candidate countries, and no final decision
has been made on expanding the group’s membership, according to
the official.  Negotiators working on an agreement to boost trade for
small- and medium-sized businesses have concluded their talks
and won’t have to participate in further multilateral meetings,
the U.S. official said.  Participants are discussing lowering barriers to trade in
areas including e-commerce, textiles, intellectual property and
health measures, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative
said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
