Pictet & Cie. and Migros Bank AG are
making sure that their American clients comply with tax rules by
asking them to buy a U.S. security,  SonntagsZeitung  reported.  Pictet is getting clients to either prove their accounts
are declared or buy at least one U.S. security, which would
automatically generate an identification code and transmit it to
the U.S. where the  Internal Revenue Service  would have free
access to the data, the newspaper reported.  Switzerland â€™s
largest closely held private bank issued instructions for
American clients at the beginning of the year, Frank Renggli, a
spokesman for the bank, told the newspaper.  Migros Bank is asking clients to buy one share in General
Electric Co. otherwise their accounts would be closed, the
newspaper said, citing a letter to customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
