Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  Chief Executive
Officer Giuseppe Orsi said the company is not under a “reign of
evil,” in an interview with  Corriere della Sera .  The shooting on May 7 of Roberto Adinolfi, Chief Executive
Officer of Rome-based Finmeccanica unit Ansaldo Nucleare, is
what happens “when Finmeccanica is portrayed as a reign of
evil,” Orsi said, according to the newspaper. “The company
needs to be cited also for what it does.”  Orsi, who took over as chairman of  Italy ’s biggest defense
company on Dec. 1 after Pier Francesco Guarguaglini stepped down
amid a corruption probe, is undertaking Finmeccanica’s biggest
overhaul in at least a decade. Orsi is cutting jobs and merging
units to achieve 440 million euros ($568 million) of savings by
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
