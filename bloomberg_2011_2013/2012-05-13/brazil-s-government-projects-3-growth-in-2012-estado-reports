Brazil’s government is projecting
3 percent growth this year after lowering expectations,
Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing unidentified government
sources.  Government officials acknowledge the Finance Ministry’s 4.5
growth target for 2012 is no longer realistic, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper said. New measures to encourage growth may be
announced starting in June, once Brazil’s first-quarter growth
figures are released, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
