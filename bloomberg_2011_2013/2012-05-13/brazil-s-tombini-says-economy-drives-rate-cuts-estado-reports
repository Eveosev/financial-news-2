Brazil ’s central bank remains
independent and the current interest-rate cutting cycle is
driven by specific economic factors, not pressure from President
Dilma Rousseff, central bank President Alexandre Tombini  told  O
Estado de S. Paulo.  Tombini said policymakers are considering cutting rates
below the current 9 percent level because the global economic
outlook deteriorated after the release of monetary policy
meeting minutes in March, in which policy makers said the
benchmark rate would fall to just above historic lows.  Tombini also said global growth potential may have fallen
because of the effects of financial crises on the real economy,
adding that Brazil’s 7.5 percent growth in 2010 “is well above
Brazil’s potential.” Tombini said 4 percent growth in Brazil
would be satisfactory, declining to give an estimate for 2012.  Brazil’s central bank president affirmed he wouldn’t use
so-called macro-prudential measures to tame inflation once
growth picks up in the second half. He will instead raise
 interest rates  when necessary, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
