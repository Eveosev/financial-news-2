Co-operative Group Ltd.’s purchase of
632 U.K. branches from  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  may be revived
after new proposals were presented to the Financial Services
Authority, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, without saying where
it obtained the information.  Under the proposals, the Lloyds management team led by Paul Pester that oversees the branches would transfer with the
business and run Co-Op’s enlarged banking division, the
newspaper said. The units sold to Co-Op would pay an annual fee
to remain on the Lloyds technology platform, it said.  The hybrid deal seeks to address regulatory concern over
Co-Op’s management, governance and computer systems expertise in
taking over the Lloyds branches. Lloyds must sell the units by
November 2013 to abide by European Union state-aid rules
following its bailout.  Lloyds ended the exclusivity of its talks with Co-Op on the
sale of Project Verde branches last month, although Co-Op
remains the preferred bidder, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
