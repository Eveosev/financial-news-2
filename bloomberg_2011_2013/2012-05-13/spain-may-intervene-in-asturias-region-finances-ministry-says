Spain may intervene in the finances
of the northern Spanish principality of Asturias because local
politicians have failed to form a government that agrees on cuts
to its  budget deficit .  “Asturias is especially worrying because the interim
situation of the government impedes it from adopting revenues
and expenses commitments,” said the Budget Ministry in a
statement yesterday.  The Spanish government may apply
corrective measures or even takeover the region’s accounts, said
the ministry.  Asturias’s interim government, led by Francisco Alvarez- Cascos former Peoples Party minister, has been negotiating with
other parties since March in an effort to form a coalition.
Spain’s regions control more than a third of public spending and
their deficit was almost twice their target last year at 2.9
percent of gross domestic product. That pushed the nation’s
shortfall to 8.5 percent of GDP compared with a 6 percent
European Union limit.  Spain  approved in March a new budget stability law allowing
it to force all regions to comply with deficit reduction goals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
