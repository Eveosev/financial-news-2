Kevin Garnett had 29 points and 11
rebounds to lead the  Boston Celtics  to a 92-91 victory over the
 Philadelphia 76ers  in the first game of their best-of-seven
National Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference semifinal.  In a Western Conference quarterfinal Game 7, Pau Gasol had
23 points and 17 rebounds to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a
96-87 victory over the Denver Nuggets. The Lakers begin their
best-of-seven conference semifinal series against the Oklahoma
City Thunder tomorrow.  At TD Garden in Boston,  Paul Pierce  had 14 points and Rajon
Rondo had his eighth playoff triple-double with 13 points, 12
rebounds and 17 assists for the Celtics, who rallied from a
second-quarter 13-point deficit.  “He’s an amazing player. He really is,” Philadelphia
coach Doug Collins said of Rondo. “He takes that ball wherever
he wants to take it on the floor.”  Philadelphia’s Jrue Holiday hit a 20-foot jumper with 33
seconds left in the game and followed 30 seconds later with the
final points of the game -- two free throws that left the 76ers
trailing 92-91.  Rondo grabbed the inbounds pass, made sure to avoid a foul
and dribbled for the final three seconds to secure the Celtics’
win.  “I feel like I could out-quick him. That’s what I did,”
Rondo said. “We knew they had a foul to give. I told Doc
(Rivers) to get me the ball and I could use my speed.”  Andre Iguodala  had 19 points for the 76ers and  Evan Turner 
added 16 points.  “Rondo just leaps out. That’s the last thing on your mind:
him going into our side of the court,” Iguodala told reporters.
“You could have a turnover down there. It’s a gamble, but it’s
a good play. We could have done a better job scoping it out.”  At Staples Center in Los Angeles, Steve Blake scored 19
points for the Lakers, who had a 48-42 halftime advantage. Ty Lawson and Al Harrington each had 24 points for the Nuggets.  In today’s games, the Memphis Grizzlies host the  Los
Angeles Clippers  in Game 7 of their Western Conference series,
while the  Indiana Pacers  visit the  Miami Heat  for the first game
of their semifinal series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
