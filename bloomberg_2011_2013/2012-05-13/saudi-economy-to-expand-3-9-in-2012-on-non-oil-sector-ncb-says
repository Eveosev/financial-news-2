Saudi Arabia ’s economy will expand
3.9 percent this year and growth will quicken to 4.4 percent in
2013,  National Commercial Bank  said.  The government will have a fiscal surplus of 317.4 billion
riyals ($84.6 billion), or 14 percent of gross domestic product,
with an average crude oil price of $105 a barrel for Arab Light
this year, the Jeddah-based bank said yesterday in an e-mailed
report. Saudi Arabia will produce an average of 9.4 million
barrels a day of oil in 2012, it said.  “Growth in non-oil sectors, particularly construction,
manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade, will also remain
robust this year, mainly due to strong private and public
investment and consumption spending,” the bank said.
“Strengthening of domestic demand is reflected in a rise in
private-sector credit and the double-digit growth in merchandise
imports.”  King Abdullah  unveiled in the first quarter of 2011 a $130
billion spending plan, which included allowances for government
workers and salary increases for military personnel. Mortgage
lending in the Arab world’s largest economy surged 27 percent to
an all-time high of 29.3 billion riyals last year, the latest
central bank data show. Credit for cars and equipment also
advanced 17 percent.  The government may register revenue this year of 1.09
trillion riyals on oil sales of 1.01 trillion riyals, National
Commercial Bank said. The kingdom’s  Finance Ministry  projected
in December revenue for this year at 702 billion riyals, less
than actual revenue of 1.11 trillion riyals in 2011.  Inflation this year will average 4.8 percent, the bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
