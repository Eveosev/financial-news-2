Minister Tokyo Sexwale plans to challenge President  Jacob Zuma 
for the position of leader of the ruling  African National
Congress  in December, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing
unidentified members of his campaign.  Sexwale’s supporters plan to install current secretary-
general Gwede Mantashe as deputy president and Deputy Sports
Minister Fikile Mbalula as secretary-general, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper said today. The members declined to be
identified because campaigning for party positions hasn’t
officially started.  “The minister will, whenever the time is right, make his
interests clear,” Sexwale’s spokesman Xolani Xundu said in a
mobile phone interview today. He declined to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
