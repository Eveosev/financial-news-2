Loewe AG (LOE)  declined to comment on a
report that  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  will purchase the German TV maker for
87.3 million euros ($112.8 million).  Loewe “does not want to take part in these rumors,” said
company spokesman Roland Raithel in an e-mailed statement.
Earlier today,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  cited an unidentified
Loewe spokesman saying that “there is no truth” to the story,
which was posted on the AppleInsider website yesterday.  Apple didn’t immediately respond today to a voicemail left
by Bloomberg News on its media hotline seeking comment.  AppleInsider, citing an unidentified person familiar with
the talks, reported a final decision on the takeover would be
announced internally at Loewe before May 18.  In January, Loewe posted a fiscal 2011 loss before interest
and taxes of 10.5 million euros on sales of 274 million euros.
The company said it expected a gain in 2012 sales.  Analysts have predicted that Cupertino, California-based
Apple, maker of the iPhone and iPad, will debut a television
within a year.  For Related News and Information:
