France  risks “chaos” if Socialists
and their allies fail to take control of parliament in
legislative elections next month, said Benoit Hamon, a spokesman
for the Socialist Party.  “If we were to lose legislative elections, the vote for
Hollande will have been good for nothing,” he said today in an
interview on  France 3  television. A right-wing government would
oppose all reforms sought by President-elect Francois Hollande,
Hamon said during the interview.  “France would fall into chaos,” Hamon said. “Financial
markets would attack” the country, he said.  The French are scheduled to vote during two rounds of
legislative elections on June 10 and June 17. A majority would
enable Hollande to push through a program that includes raising
taxes, increasing spending, imposing a 75 percent levy on
incomes above 1 million euros ($1.29 million) and returning the
minimum  retirement age  to 60 from 62.  Hollande will use the law to “stop the closing of plants
that are still profitable just because they aren’t profitable
enough” or if rival companies may buy them, Hamon said.  “I have no doubt on his determination” to proceed on
legislation that will help save jobs, Hamon said. “We want to
stop the industrial haemorrhage taking place in France.”  The Socialists control the Senate and 21 of 22 regions in
mainland France. President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s Union for a  Popular
Movement  holds 305 seats in the National Assembly against the
Socialists’ 197. Hollande’s win over Sarkozy on May 6 gave his
party the presidency for the first time since 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
