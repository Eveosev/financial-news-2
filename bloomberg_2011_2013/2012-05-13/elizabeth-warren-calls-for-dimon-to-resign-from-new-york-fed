Elizabeth Warren , a Massachusetts
candidate for U.S. Senate, called for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  to resign his position as a
director at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Dimon, who disclosed a $2 billion trading loss by his bank
last week, shouldn’t stay on the board of the New York Fed
because “he advises the Federal Reserve on the oversight of the
financial industry,” she said in an e-mail release.  Warren, a Democrat, has served in the Office of the
President and as chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel
for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. She helped establish the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  “After the biggest financial crisis in generations, the
American people are frustrated that Wall Street has still not
been held accountable and does not appear to consider itself
responsible,” she said. “Dimon should resign from his post at
the  New York  Fed to send a signal to the American people that
Wall Street bankers get it and to show that they understand the
need for responsibility and accountability.”  Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, didn’t
immediately respond to a message outside business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
