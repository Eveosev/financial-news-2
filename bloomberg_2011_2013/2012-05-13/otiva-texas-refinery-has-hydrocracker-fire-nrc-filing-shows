Motiva Enterprises LLC had a fire at
a lubricants hydrocracker yesterday at its Port Arthur, Texas,
refinery, according to regulatory filings with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality and the  National Response
Center .  The fire occurred after a leak on heater led to a flaring
of gases, according to the filing.  “Unit was shut down and depressured to flare system per
emergency shutdown procedure,” the company said in the Texas
 filing . The incident began yesterday at 7:45 a.m. and ended at
10:30 a.m. local time. “Unit was isolated and secured.”  U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
