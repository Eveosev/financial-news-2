Egyptian Finance Minister Momtaz el- Saieed approved the release of $100 million to meet domestic
demand for the import of petroleum products.  The extra amount brings the total given to the Egyptian
General Petroleum Corp. during the fiscal year ending June 30 to
about $3.7 billion, the ministry said today in a statement. The
minister also approved 200 million Egyptian pounds ($33 million)
to pay money owed to farmers for supplying sugar cane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
