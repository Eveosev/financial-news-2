Novagalicia Banco said in a
regulatory filing that it needs 1.1 billion euros ($1.42
billion) to comply with new provisions set by the Spanish
government.  Countryâ€™s banks will have to raise capital to provide for
potential losses on 123 billion euros of real estate-linked
loans and the government will provide funds for those needing
support, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said May 11.  Novagalicia may consider the inclusion of new alternatives
to comply with the provision rules apart from those already
approved by the Bank of  Spain  in April, the lender said in the
filing, without detailing which options are being studied.  To contact the reporter on this story:
