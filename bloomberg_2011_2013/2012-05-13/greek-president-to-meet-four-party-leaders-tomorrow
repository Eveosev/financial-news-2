Greek President Karolos Papoulias
will meet with political party leaders at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow as
discussions on forming a national unity government continue,
state-run NET TV said, without citing anyone.  New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, Pasok leader
 Evangelos Venizelos  and the head of the Democratic Left party
Fotis Kouvelis will attend the meeting, NET reported. NET
initially said that Syriza party head Alexis Tsipras was also
expected to attend the meeting, but later reported he would not
be taking part.  Syriza is the second-largest party in Parliament and the
biggest party opposed to the terms of the countryâ€™s
international bailout.  Greece  may face new national elections
unless a government is formed following the inconclusive voting
on May 6.  Kouvelis said he regretted that his proposal to form a
unity government had failed.  Papoulias said that there is no unity government at this
time due to the refusal of the Syriza party to back such a
proposal, Kouvelis told reporters in  Athens  today, after meeting
with the president. He spoke in comments televised live on
state-run NET TV.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
