Invensys Plc (ISYS)  is the target for
potential bids from industrial groups including  Siemens AG (SIE) ,  ABB
Ltd. (ABBN) ,  Emerson Electric Co. (EMR)  and  General Electric Co. (GE) , the Sunday
Times said, without saying where it obtained the information.  All four groups have approached Invensys through bankers to
either acquire outright the company with a market value of 1.6
billion pounds ($2.6 billion) or to its breakup, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
