LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , the port operator
former billionaire  Eike Batista  is ceding control of, rallied
after saying it’s in negotiations to extend debt payments as it
completes investments in Rio de Janeiro state.  LLX, as the Rio-based company is known, climbed 7.5 percent
to 1.72 reais at the close of trading in  Sao Paulo , the highest
since June 4. The stock is down 28 percent for the year, almost
double the 15 percent drop in Brazil’s main stock index, amid a
production collapse at Batista’s oil company OGX Participacoes &
Petroleo SA.  State development bank BNDES and Banco Bradesco SA are in
“advanced talks” with the company to renegotiate debt coming
due in September and February, respectively, LLX said in an e-mailed statement today. The renegotiation is for a 518 million-reais ($216 million) loan with BNDES and a 345 million-reais
loan with Bradesco, LLX said.  LLX has gained 14 percent since it announced after markets
closed on Aug. 14 that EIG Global Equity Partners LLC would
would buy as much as 1.3 billion reais in shares. EIG will take
control of the company from Batista following the share sale,
reassuring investors that the Acu port project will have
financing for its completion, LLX said Aug. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
