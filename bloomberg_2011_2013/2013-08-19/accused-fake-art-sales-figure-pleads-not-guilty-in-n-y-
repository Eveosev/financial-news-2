An art dealer accused of conspiring
to sell $30 million in fake works purportedly by masters
including Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, pleaded not guilty in
federal court in New York.  Glafira Rosales entered a plea today before U.S. District
Judge Katherine Polk Failla in  Manhattan  to a nine-count
indictment. Rosales faces charges including conspiracy to commit
wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, wire fraud,
money laundering and tax crimes.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Hernandez said the government
may reach an agreement with Rosales by the end of the month.  “We believe we are going to reach a disposition in this
case,” he said. “I believe we are still on track to do that on
or before Aug. 30.”  Rosales helped sell the fake works to at least two
galleries, the government alleged. Purchasers of artwork from
New York’s now-defunct Knoedler Gallery filed a lawsuit in 2012
alleging that they bought a fake Rothko supplied by Rosales.  Rosales had offered at least 20 purportedly
“undiscovered” artworks, including the Rothko work, according
to a complaint filed in September. The dealer had invoked the
Fifth Amendment when testifying previously about the source of
her works, according to the complaint.  A lawyer for Rosales, Steven Kartagener, declined to
comment on the case.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Rosales, 13-cr-00518, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
