The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  against non-payment rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 0.5 of a basis point
to 95 basis points as of 9:07 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The benchmark advanced 2 basis points
last week in the first rise since the five-day period ended July
26, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 141 basis points
at 8:06 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. prices show. The gauge climbed 4.5 basis points on Aug. 16,
the biggest one-day gain since July 25, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 120 basis points as of 10:02 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The index has ranged from 96.1
basis points to 149.5 basis points this year, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
