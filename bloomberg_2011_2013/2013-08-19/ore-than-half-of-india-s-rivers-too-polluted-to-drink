Raw sewage and industrial waste
rendered water in more than half of  India ’s 445 rivers unfit for
drinking, according to the  Central Pollution Control Board .  The  report  compared pollution levels from 1995 to 2011
including the rivers as well as 154 lakes and 78 ponds in the
second-most populous nation. Water from at least a quarter of
the rivers surveyed can’t even be used for bathing, it said.  India will need “considerable” investments in waste
management to meet demands of growing urban populations. Only 29
percent of municipal wastewater is treated by Indian cities of
38 billion liters (10 billion gallons) generated every day,
according to the report. By 2050, 100 billion liters may come
from Indian cities each day, it said.  India’s per capita fresh water resources have fallen to
1,845 cubic meters in 2007 from 6,042 cubic meters in 1947,
according to the report. This is expected to drop to 1,000 cubic
meters by the end of the century, it said. Indian cities use 50
billion liters of municipal water a day, the report said.  Although the nation isn’t facing immediate water scarcity
issues, several river basins including the  Sabarmati  in western
India are under severe stress, according to the report made
public last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
