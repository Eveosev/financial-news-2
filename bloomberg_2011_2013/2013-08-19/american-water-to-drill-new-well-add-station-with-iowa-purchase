American Water Works Co. (AWK) , the
largest publicly traded water utility in the U.S., has begun
drilling a well and plans to add a pump station after its Iowa
unit acquired the town of Dixon’s water system.  The purchase of the system in the town northwest of
Davenport by Iowa American Water will require a $500,000
investment to bring the system in compliance with federal
environmental standards and state requirements, the Voorhees,
New Jersey-based company said in an Aug. 16 statement.  Water produced from the well will reduce nitrate levels
“significantly below” state water-quality standards while the
second project involves building a booster pump station to
increase water pressure. The works are due to be operational by
the end of next month, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
