Western Canadian Select heavy oil
weakened to a three-month low as plants that use the grade are
expected to shut down for maintenance next month.  Two Alberta upgraders, or plants that convert heavy oil
into higher quality light synthetic grades, are scheduled to be
taken down for maintenance in and around September, lowering the
amount of crude they’ll consume. The September index trading
period that sets the average price of Canadian grades to be
delivered next month ends today.  Western Canadian Select weakened by $2 a barrel to a $24
discount to West Texas Intermediate oil, according to Calgary
oil broker Net Energy Inc. It was the widest discount for the
grade since May 6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Husky Energy Inc. (HSE) ’s 82,000-barrel-a-day Lloydminster
upgrader will shut for 45 days starting in early September,
executives said on an earnings call last month.  Suncor Energy
Inc. (SU)  said Aug. 1 that it’s planning four to five weeks of
maintenance on the 110,000-barrel-a-day Unit 2 at its Fort
McMurray upgrader.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s 97,870-barrel-a-day Scotford
 refinery  in Alberta also will close for most of September, a
person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on July 30.  WCS barrels for October delivery weakened by 50 cents to a
$24-a-barrel discount, Net Energy said. That narrowed the spread
versus September to parity.  Syncrude synthetic light oil was unchanged at a $3.60
premium to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
