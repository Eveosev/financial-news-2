India  called off a launch of a
rocket designed to carry large satellites into space after a
leak was detected in its fuel system, marking a third
consecutive failure of the technology.  India has been attempting to join an elite club of five
nations -- the U.S., Russia, Japan, China and  France  -- that use
their own advanced cryogenic rocket technology to launch heavier
satellite payloads. Two previous Indian attempts to launch such
a rocket failed in 2010.  The  Indian Space Research Organization  discovered the fault
on the GSLV-D5 rocket, powered by a so-called cryogenic engine,
two hours before the scheduled liftoff at 4:50 p.m today from
the Sriharikota space center in southern Andhra Pradesh state.  “We will assess the data and find out the cause of the
fuel leakage,” ISRO chairman K. Radhakrishnan said in a
televised press conference. “We will announce the new date
after the assessment.”  The countdown for the launch of the rocket, carrying the
GSAT-14 communications satellite, began at 11:50 a.m. yesterday.  Cryogenic engines use  low-density liquefied gases  as a
fuel, increasing the size of the  storage tanks  and adding to the
bulk of the rocket.  India put its  first space rocket  into space in 1963 and its
first satellite in 1975.  To contact the reporter on this story:
