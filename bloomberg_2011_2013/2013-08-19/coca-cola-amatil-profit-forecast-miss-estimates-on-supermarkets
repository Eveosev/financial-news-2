Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL) ,  Australia ’s
largest listed drinks company, posted first-half profit that
missed analyst estimates and said a measure of full-year
earnings would be as much as 22 percent below expectations.  Net income fell 12 percent to A$216 million from A$246
million a year earlier, the Sydney-based company said in a
regulatory statement. That compared with the A$220 million
average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Competition in Australian supermarkets, where Woolworths
Ltd. and  Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES)  units have an 80 percent market share,
weighed on profits, the company said. Full-year group earnings
before interest and tax may fall as much as four percent below
last year’s result, missing the A$890 million average of 11
analyst estimates by about 22 percent.  “While the Australian non-grocery business continues to
perform well, the trading conditions in the grocery channel
continue to be challenging,” Terry Davis, group managing
director, said in a statement.  Ebit fell 6.9 percent during the first half excluding one
time items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
