An investment and retail sales boom
helped maintain  Chile ’s economic growth above 4 percent in the
second quarter, while unexpectedly leaving the current account
deficit little changed.  Gross domestic product rose 4.1 percent from last year,
compared with revised expansion of 4.5 percent in the previous
three months, the central bank said in a report posted on its
website today. The median estimate of 17 analysts polled by
Bloomberg was for growth of 4 percent. The current account gap
was $1.63 billion, compared with $1.6 billion the year earlier
and the median estimate of $3.9 billion.  The central bank kept borrowing costs unchanged at 5
percent on Aug. 13 for a 19th consecutive month as policy makers
juggle the opposing pressures of a consumer spending boom and
stagnant manufacturing output. Consumer demand remains
“dynamic” and hasn’t slowed as much as economic activity, the
bank said in a statement accompanying the decision, while
signaling it may cut rates later in the year as growth slows
from 5.6 percent in 2012.  Retail sales growth in the world’s top copper producer
averaged an annual 10.6 percent in the second quarter, while
manufacturing contracted an average 1.2 percent, according to
the National Statistics Institute.  The current account deficit was 2.4 percent of GDP in the
second quarter, little changed from 2.5 percent last year, the
central bank reported today. Policy makers in July forecast the
shortfall would reach $13.2 billion for the year, compared with
$9.5 billion in 2012.  Chile had a  trade surplus  in goods and services of $299
million, the bank said. The price of copper, which accounts for
more than half of Chile’s exports, has fallen 10 percent this
year.  Investment expanded 9.3 percent from last year, compared
with revised growth of 9.5 percent in the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
