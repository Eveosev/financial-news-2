World No. 1 Novak Djokovic qualified
for the year-ending ATP World Tour Finals, joining  Rafael Nadal 
in the championship for the top eight men’s tennis players.  The Serb is the title-holder at the London event, which is
worth $1.92 million to the winner. Nadal made the tournament,
held November 4 to 11, after winning the French Open in June.
The list of competitors is based on ATP rankings.  Djokovic, 26, was defeated by John Isner at the Cincinnati
Open on Aug. 16, his last warm-up for the U.S. Open, the final
Grand Slam of the season which starts at Flushing Meadows next
week. He’s attempting to add to his six major titles, the last
of which came with his defeat of  Andy Murray  at the Australian
Open in January.  Djokovic beat  Roger Federer  in last year’s tour final, and
also won the event in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
