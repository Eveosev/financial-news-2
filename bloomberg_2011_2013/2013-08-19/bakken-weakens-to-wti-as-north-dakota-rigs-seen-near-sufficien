Crude from the Bakken shale
formation weakened after a North Dakota regulator said increased
efficiency means not many more rigs are needed in the state.  Bakken’s discount to West Texas Intermediate widened 50
cents to $4.50 a barrel at 1:56 p.m.  New York  time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Rigs are now so efficient that 185 to 190 can drill as many
wells as crews can complete, said Lynn Helms, head of North
Dakota’s Department of Mineral Resources, on Aug. 16. There are
now 183 rigs, the state’s website said today.  “The current condition of our Bakken plays is that we’ve
reached our cruising altitude, so it is safe to get up and walk
around,” said Helms on an Aug. 16 call announcing record
production. “But you really should stay in your seat with your
seatbelt fastened in case of turbulence.”  Crudes produced on the Gulf Coast were mixed. Mars Blend
and Poseidon slipped 20 cents each to a discount of 25 cents and
70 cents a barrel, respectively. Bonito Sour’s premium slipped
20 cents to $2.70 a barrel against WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s discount to WTI narrowed by 40
cents to $1.60 a barrel. The premium for Thunder Horse increased
75 cents to $3.25 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium rose 5 cents to $4.80 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet slipped 40 cents to $4.10 a barrel
over WTI.  To contact the reporters on this story:
