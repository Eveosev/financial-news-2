Ousted Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  was ordered released in connection with a palace
corruption case by a Cairo criminal court ruling today in a move
that could have him back home within days.  Mubarak, who was ousted after a mass uprising that began in
January 2011, is to be freed in connection two other cases,
including one dealing with his role in the killing of protesters
during the uprising. The court said he could be freed if he’s
not been ordered held in any other cases.  Mubarak could be home in “two to three days, God
willing,” his attorney, Farid ElDib said by phone today.
Mahmoud el-Hefnawy, an official with the prosecutor-general’s
office, said the deposed leader is still being held in another
case dealing with accepting gifts from the state-run Ahram
organization, which owns the national newspaper, Al-Ahram.
Mubarak has already repaid the money in that case and could
appeal to be released, el-Hefnawy said.  The Cairo court said his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, would
have to remain in custody while investigations continue.  The former president, who ruled  Egypt  for nearly 30 years,
has alternately been held in a military hospital and a nearby
prison intensive care unit since his ouster.  Activists, Islamists and others who played a key role in
the January 2011 uprising have insisted he be brought to justice
for the deaths of protesters during the 18-day demonstrations
that pushed him from power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
