Swiss stocks  retreated for a third
day as investors speculated the  Federal Reserve  will start
reducing its monthly bond-buying program this year.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  dropped the most in 21 months as  UBS AG (UBSN) 
downgraded the world’s largest cement maker. UBS and  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s biggest banks, retreated more
than 2 percent.  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , which accounts for 17 percent
of the  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , advanced 0.9 percent after Citigroup
Inc. said the drugmaker was among its most preferred stocks.  The SMI fell 21.89 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,939.42 at
the close in Zurich. The gauge has slipped 1.7 percent since
Aug. 14, the biggest three-day drop in eight weeks. The SMI has
 still gained  16 percent this year, driving its valuation to 15.2
times estimated earnings, compared with an average of 13 times
over the past three years. The broader Swiss Performance Index
slipped 0.2 percent today.  “Some uncertainty about Fed tapering still remains,” said
Christoph Riniker, head of strategy research at  Julius Baer
Group Ltd. (BAER)  in Zurich. “For the Swiss market, with its very
defensive sector composition, the current constructive macro
environment is causing more headwinds than tailwinds. The
valuation is quite expensive. We don’t think the market looks
very attractive going forward.”  FOMC Minutes  The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose four basis points
to 2.87 percent, before the release of minutes on Wednesday from
the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The minutes from
the July 30-31 meeting will probably provide details of the
risks from allowing inflation to fall below the central bank’s 2
percent target.  Holcim lost 4.4 percent to 67.75 Swiss francs after UBS
downgraded the cement maker to neutral from buy. The brokerage
lowered its estimates for the company’s earnings in 2013 and
2014 because of increased costs from currency fluctuations and
downward pressure on its profit margins.  UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank, declined 2.2 percent to
18.83 francs and Credit Suisse, the second largest, dropped 2.1
percent to 28.38 francs. Banks lost 1.8 percent, contributing
the most to a decline by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Julius Baer , Switzerland’s third-biggest wealth manager,
slipped 1.1 percent to 43.14 francs.  Roche gained 0.9 percent to 238.30 francs after Citigroup
analyst Andrew S. Baum said he expects the world’s biggest maker
of cancer drugs to rise more than GlaxoSmithKline Plc in the
next three months. Roche’s pipeline of drugs provides enough
options to outweigh concern about competition for existing
cancer treatments including Avastin and Rituxan, he wrote in a
note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
