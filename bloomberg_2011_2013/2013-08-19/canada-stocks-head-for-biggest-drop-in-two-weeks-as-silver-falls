Canadian  stocks  fell, for the
biggest drop since June, as a decline in gold and silver spurred
losses in metal producers and energy companies slumped the most
in eight weeks.  B2Gold Corp. (BTO)  plunged 13 percent to pace declines among gold
mining companies after announcing a $225 million note offering.
Endeavour Silver Corp. and Silvercorp Metals Inc. slipped at
least 2.9 percent as the price of the metal snapped the longest
winning streak since January. Penn West Petroleum Ltd. and
Bonterra Energy Corp. retreated more than 1.2 percent as crude
fell.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 148.90

index has gained 1.2 percent this year, the third-worst
performance among developed markets ahead of Singapore and  Hong
Kong .  “Nothing goes up forever, the gold commodity had a good
run as well as the stocks last week and they’re taking a bit of
a pause today,” said  John Kinsey , a  fund manager  with Caldwell
Securities Ltd. in Toronto. The firm manages about $1 billion.
“The financials are down today, with the usual headwinds of
mortgages and housing still present. It’s been a case of going
up one day and then back down the next, and that’s going to
continue to the end of the month when the banks report
earnings.”  Financial stocks declined 0.9 percent as  all 10  industries
in the S&P/TSX retreated. Trading volume was 17 percent lower
than the 30-day average at this time of the day.  BMO, Scotiabank  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  lost 0.7 percent to C$63.96 and Bank of
 Nova Scotia  slipped 0.2 percent to C$58.12. The two banks will
report their third-quarter earnings on Aug. 27, the first of
Canada’s major banks to do so for this period.  BMO is expected to report  adjusted earnings  of C$1.53 a
share and  Scotiabank (BNS)  C$1.31 a share, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Penn West Petroleum sank 4.5 percent to C$11.78 and
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. fell 2.6 percent to C$30.67 as
55 of 58 members of the S&P/TSX Energy Index fell. The energy
index lost 1.7 percent, the biggest decline since June 20.  Crude fell for the first time in seven days as the threat
of a storm in the  Gulf of Mexico  dissipated, removing a risk to
oil and gas production. Crude for September delivery fell 0.3
percent to $107.10 a barrel in New York.  B2Gold sank 13 percent to C$2.95, the biggest loss in
almost five years. The gold producer, with mines in  Nicaragua ,
Colombia and Uruguay, said it was raising the debt for “general
corporate purposes.”  Silvercorp Metals lost 5.1 percent to C$3.75 and Endeavour
Silver fell 2.9 percent to C$5.28 as silver for December
delivery retreated 0.7 percent to $23.22. The price of silver

to clients that the entry into service of the company’s CSeries
jet may be pushed into early 2015.  Utilities stocks plunged 2.8 percent for a three-year low,
as 10 of 11 companies in the group declined amid a rise in bond
yields. Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. fell 4.3 percent to
C$6.64 and TransAlta Corp. retreated 2.1 percent to C$13.84.  The S&P/TSX Utilities Index yielded 5 percent in dividends
in the second quarter, compared with 3.2 percent for the
S&P/TSX, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. Treasury yields jumped to the highest level since 2011
today amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will trim its bond
purchasing program next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
