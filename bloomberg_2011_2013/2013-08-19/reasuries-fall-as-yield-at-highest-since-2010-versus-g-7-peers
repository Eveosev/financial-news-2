Treasuries fell, with yields on 10-year notes reaching two-year highs for a third consecutive day,
as investors look to the minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s last
meeting for clues on the eventual slowing of bond purchases.  Yields on the benchmark security rose to the highest since
July 2011 as central bankers and policy makers also gather this
week in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , to discuss the global economy and
monetary policy. The Fed’s first step may be tapering monthly
debt purchases in September by $10 billion to a $75 billion
pace, according to the median estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey concluded last week. The U.S. central bank
publishes the minutes of its July 30-31 meeting Aug. 21.  “Every little uptick is met with sellers,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in
 New York , one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the central
bank. “There’s more of a feeling tapering is going to happen in
September.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.88 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.5 percent
benchmark note maturing in August 2023 fell 15/32, or $4.69 per
$1,000 face amount, to 96 23/32. The rate earlier reached 2.9
percent, the highest level since July 2011.  U.S. 10-year securities yielded 39 basis points more than
bonds in an index of G-7 debt, the most since May 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on closing prices.  Volume, Volatility  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 22 percent to
$246 billion, from $315.5 billion on Aug. 16. The figure is down
from a 2013 high of $662.26 billion reached on May 22 and up
from a low of $147.8 billion on Aug. 9. This year’s average is
$313 billion.  Volatility as measured by the Merrill Lynch Option
Volatility Estimate MOVE Index rose to 99.48 today, the highest
level since July 9. The average for 2013 is 68.  Treasuries have lost 3.6 percent this year through Aug. 16,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped
2.3 percent and gilts slid 4.7 percent.  An indicator of momentum used by some dealers signaled that
Treasuries are oversold. The 14-day  relative-strength index  for
the 10-year yield has risen above the 70 threshold that
indicates it has climbed too much. The last time it exceeded
that level was July 5, which was followed by a two-week rally.  “The Fed not announcing anything regarding tapering is
causing uncertainty and a situation where yields have to drift
higher, especially on the long end, until the market knows what
they are dealing with,” said Dan Heckman, fixed-income
strategist in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , at U.S. Bank Wealth
Management, which manages $110 billion.  Third Round  Fed policy makers led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  are
contemplating how to end a third round of quantitative easing
that has swelled the Fed’s balance sheet to a record $3.59
trillion. The central bank will end purchases in mid-2014,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 48
economists conducted Aug. 9-13.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  holds its next meeting on
Sept. 17-18.  “The market continues to be set adrift because people are
uncertain as to what the rules of engagement will be,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in New
York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “No one wants to commit to the
market until they figure out where the Fed is at. There’s been a
bit of a psychological change.”  Yield Curve  Sales of  previously-owned U.S. homes  rose in July, analysts
said before an industry report due on Aug. 21. Purchases rose to
a 5.15 million annualized rate, according to the median forecast
of economists before the National Association of Realtors
publishes the data.  The  difference  between U.S. two- and 10-year yields
expanded to as much as 254 basis points today, the widest level
since July 2011.  Bonds declined last week amid concern former Treasury
Secretary  Larry Summers  will win out over Fed Vice Chairman
 Janet Yellen  as the next head of the central bank, according to
Jefferies LLC. Bernanke’s term ends in January.  “The growing conviction that Larry Summers as Fed Chairman
should be equated with an accelerated rate of tapering has been
the primary catalyst to the recent distress in both the bond and
stock markets,”  Ward McCarthy , the chief financial economist at
Jefferies, wrote in a Aug. 16 report. The company is a primary
dealer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
