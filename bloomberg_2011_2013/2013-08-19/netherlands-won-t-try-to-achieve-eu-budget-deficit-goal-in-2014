The Netherlands won’t try to keep
its  budget deficit  within European Union limits next year,
Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said.  “We de facto let the 3 percent budget-deficit limit go for
2014,” based on the prognosis of the Central Planning Bureau,
the agency that calculates the effect of budget decisions,
Dijsselbloem said in a question-and-answer session with citizens
in Amsterdam today. The Netherlands plans 6 billion euros ($8
billion) in budget cuts “to keep the budget deficit from
running out of control next year,” he added.  Prime Minister  Mark Rutte ’s cabinet plans to seal an
agreement on cost cuts and tax increases for 2014 within a
month. That’s in addition to a four-year, 16 billion-euro
package the coalition government approved in November when it
took office. The deficit will widen to 3.9 percent of gross
domestic product in 2014 from 3 percent this year if no extra
measures are taken, the Central Planning Bureau said on Aug. 14.
The bureau hasn’t given a forecast for the 2014 deficit
including the 6 billion euros of measures.  The Dutch  economy , in its third recession since the
financial crisis started in 2008, shrank 0.2 percent in the
second quarter. The economy has contracted in eight of the last
nine quarters and isn’t expected to return to growth until next
year, according to the CPB. GDP in the euro area’s fifth-largest
economy will fall 1.25 percent this year and grow 0.75 percent
in 2014, the CPB forecasts.  “The economy will definitely grow next year, I’m convinced
of that,” Dijsselbloem said.  The finance minister is scheduled to present the 2014
budget on Sept. 17. He said Aug. 14 he would introduce
additional budget measures not exceeding 6 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
