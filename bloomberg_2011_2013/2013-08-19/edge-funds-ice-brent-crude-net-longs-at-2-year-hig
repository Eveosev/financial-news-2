Hedge funds and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  to the highest in more than
two years in the week ended Aug. 13, according to data from ICE
Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 193,527 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitments
of Traders report. That’s up 2.5 percent from last week and is
the most since at least January 2011, the starting point for the
data series.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 398,973, a 1.1
percent expansion from the week before, bringing their  net-short 
position to the largest since July 16.  Brent gained 1.5 percent in the week to Aug. 13 to $109.82
a barrel and traded at $110.51 as of 12:37 p.m. local time
today.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Swaps dealers bolstered net-long positions in Brent for a
second week, by 0.4 percent to 233,187, the highest since July
16.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European  gasoil  futures
fell for a third week, slipping 2.4 percent to 57,653 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
