Union members at  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) 
staged a partial strike today that cost the automaker 43.5
billion won ($39 million) in lost output, with plans for another
work stoppage tomorrow before resuming wage negotiations.  The four-hour walkout by the Seoul-based company’s 45,000
union members resulted in lost production of 2,106 vehicles,
according to an e-mail from South  Korea ’s largest automaker. The
union said yesterday it will hold another partial strike
tomorrow before resuming talks with the management on Aug. 22.  The strikes take place as the weaker yen gives Japanese
automakers an edge in cutting prices or offering better
incentives. Stalled wage talks at Hyundai Motor last year led to
the costliest walkout in its history, before management agreed
to reduce working hours with two shorter day shifts. The workers
have gone on strike in 22 of the past 26 years.  “It’s bad news for Hyundai as it marks the official start
of yet another strike season,” Lee Sang Hyun, an analyst at NH
Investment & Securities Co., said by phone. “Still, the strikes
aren’t expected to last long nor incur more damage than last
year’s walkouts did especially due to the shorter working
hours.”  Hyundai declined 2.4 percent, the biggest fall since Aug.
7, to 229,000 won at the close in Seoul. Affiliate  Kia Motors
Corp. (000270)  fell 1.9 percent to 61,700 won. The benchmark Kospi index
fell 1.6 percent.  Hyundai and Kia’s labor unions have said they’re demanding
a pay increase of 130,498 won a month and for 30 percent of net
income to be distributed to workers. The talks started May 28
for Hyundai and July 2 for Kia.  Costliest Strike  During last year’s negotiations, the company and the union
agreed to end overnight shifts at its plants in South Korea,
reducing working hours from 20 hours a day to 17 hours each day,
according to the company’s e-mailed statement in March. The
strikes last year caused a production shortfall of 82,088
vehicles and an estimated 1.7 trillion won in lost sales.  More than 70 percent of Hyundai’s 45,000 guild members
voted in favor of authorizing union leader Moon Yong Moon to
call for a walkout at the company on Aug. 14.  The results may signal a resurgence in union activism in
 South Korea  as unemployment rises and employers shift production
overseas. Past Hyundai union protests have led to clashes
between police and militant unionists armed with steel pipes and
Molotov cocktails.  The number of South Korean work days lost on labor disputes
more than  doubled  to 933 days last year from 429 in 2011,
according to data compiled by the nation’s Ministry of
Employment and Labor. In 1993, the  Bank of Korea  cited
protracted labor strife at Hyundai as a key reason for its
decision to lower its gross national product estimate.  Prior to 2008, the union went on strike every year except
one, costing what Hyundai estimates to be more than 1 million
vehicles valued at 11.6 trillion won in lost sales.  The union at Kia, which also voted in favor of going on
strike last week, hasn’t decided on the specific schedule for
the walkouts and will resume talks with the company on Aug. 22,
according to a text message from the union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
