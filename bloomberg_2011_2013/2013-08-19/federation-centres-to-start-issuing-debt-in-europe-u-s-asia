Federation Centres (FDC) , the shopping
mall operator formerly known as Centro Retail  Australia , plans
to issue medium-term notes overseas for the first time to extend
the tenor of its debt.  The company will turn to debt markets in  Europe , North
America and  Asia  to diversify away from Australian bank loans,
Chief Executive Officer Steven Sewell said in a telephone
interview from  Melbourne . Federation Centers today reported
A$212.7 million ($196 million) in  net income  in the year to June
30, compared with a loss of A$222.9 million a year earlier.  The Melbourne-based company’s sale of stakes in its malls
in the past year has helped cut debt as a proportion of assets
to 18 percent of assets as of July 31, from about 30 percent as
of Dec. 31, the company said in its results statement today.
With a target range for gearing as high as 35 percent, the
company can borrow to fund its A$581 million share of planned
redevelopments without raising equity, Sewell said today.  “We’re looking at issuing medium-term notes or bonds in
particular offshore markets of Europe,  North America ,  Canada ,
and up into Asia, that have a maturity of 7, 10, 12, even
potentially 15 years,” Sewell said. “We’re looking at getting
in front of investors after this result and as the commercial
attractiveness of those markets opens up, we’ll be able to
strike.”  Federation Centres  shares  were unchanged at A$2.22 at the
close of trading in Sydney. They’ve declined 2.2 percent this
year, compared with 2.9 percent advance in the S&P/ASX 200 A-REIT index.  Credit Rating  Federation Centres has a  credit rating  of BBB+ from
Standard and Poor’s, and its bank debt is rated A-, the company
said today. Issuing medium-term notes overseas would allow the
mall operator to extend its average debt maturity to about seven
years from the current 3.7 years, Sewell said today.  The company today reported underlying earnings of A$224.4
million, compared with A$123.2 million a year earlier and
slightly above a forecast of A$223 million, according to the
median estimate of 11  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  Federation Centres’ full-year  dividend  will be 14.1 cents,
the company said today. Earnings per share in the year to June
30, 2014, will be between 16.5 Australian cents and 16.8 cents,
up from 15.8 cents reported today, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
