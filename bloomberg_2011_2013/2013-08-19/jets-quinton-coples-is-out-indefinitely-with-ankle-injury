New York  Jets defensive end Quinton
Coples will miss the rest of the National Football League
preseason and is out indefinitely with a right ankle injury.  The Jets said in a  statement  that Coples will undergo a
“medical procedure” tomorrow, without elaborating.  The New York Daily News  reported  yesterday that Coples, 23,
suffered a hairline fracture in his ankle and would probably
miss three to four weeks. The Jets open the regular season Sept.
8 against the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers .  Coples, who had 5 1/2 sacks as a rookie last season, was
injured two days ago while rushing Jacksonville Jaguars
quarterback Chad Henne during the first half of the Jets’ 37-13
preseason win. Coples had been spending time at outside
linebacker as well as defensive end during training camp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
