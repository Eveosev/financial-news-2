Steel reinforcement-bar futures rose,
extending a rally in the past three weeks, as  China ’s new home
prices climbed and investors expected increased infrastructure
investments, boosting demand for the construction material.  Rebar for January delivery gained as much as 0.8 percent to
3,843 yuan ($629) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
and was at 3,821 yuan at 10:59 a.m. local time. The most-active
contract rose 1.5 percent last week for a third straight gain.  China’s new-home prices in July advanced the most since
January 2011 in the nation’s four major cities, led by a 17
percent jump in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, according to a statement
by the National Bureau of Statistics yesterday. The country’s
banks will lend more to infrastructure projects and boost the
economy, the China Securities Journal reported today.  “Rebar’s upward trend looks intact as the demand outlook
improved,” said Ren Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng Futures Co.
