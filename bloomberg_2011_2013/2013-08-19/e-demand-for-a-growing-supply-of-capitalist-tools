You can take the aesthete out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the aesthete. That's one way of explaining the success of the German (and now British) store  Manufactum , best described as a Wal-Mart for the 1%.  Need an ice scraper? How about one with a  bronze blade and beech handle  for $27? Table clamp? Forget Loews -- Manufactum's got an  aluminum system  for $700. What about a bucket for cleaning supplies? Presto: here's one in  stainless steel  for $105. It's like someone turned  Marie Antoinette's farm  into a mail-order business. And while anyone who would actually use such tools professionally wouldn't be caught dead with, say, a $62 birch " tool carrier ," the store's continuing success speaks to the profound, and profoundly lucrative, longings of urbanites the world over. The prices may be mystifying, but the impulse to buy such products is straightforward. It's the same reason people buy  winter jackets designed for climbing Everest  -- they're paying for the potential. So no, you will not be scaling an ice face any time soon, or using your $90  Japanese toolbox  from NYC's  Kiosk  to carry tools to a construction site. But you  could.  In the meantime, who cares if the stuff is gathering dust? There's a $57  dustpan and brush , just in case you do.
