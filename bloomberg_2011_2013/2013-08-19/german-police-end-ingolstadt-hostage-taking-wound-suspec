German police ended an 8-hour
hostage crisis in the Bavarian town of Ingolstadt by storming
the town-hall holdout of the suspect, a 24-year-old male, and
wounding him with shots to the shoulder and legs.  Police cordoned off the town-center site at about 9 a.m.
this morning after the homeless man wielding a handgun took four
government employees captive, Ingolstadt police said on their
 website . After two captives were freed by the suspect during the
day, the police decided at 5:30 p.m. to assault the building
when his behavior became “unpredictable.”  Two remaining hostages, a 37-year-old man and a 25-year-old
woman, were freed by police and were unharmed. The officers
recovered an imitation handgun “with a convincing similarity to
a P99” pistol made by Carl Walther GmbH and a large knife,
according to the website statement.  Chancellor Angela Merkel , who is campaigning ahead of a
national election next month, canceled rallies planned today in
Ingolstadt and Regensburg.  The arrested hostage-taker has a criminal record and was
barred from entering Ingolstadt’s town hall following alleged
“stalking” incidents linked to the 25-year-old government
employee he held captive, the police said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
