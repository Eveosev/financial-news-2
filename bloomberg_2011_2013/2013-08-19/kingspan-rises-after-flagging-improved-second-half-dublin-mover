Kingspan Group Plc (KSP) , the maker of
building insulation panels, rose in Dublin trading after
signalling improved earnings in the second half and said
acquisitions boosted first-half results.  Kingspan rose as much as 4.5  percent to 11.4 euros, its
highest since December 2007 in intraday trading, after saying it
should “deliver an improved year-on-year result in the second
half.” Revenue climbed 13 percent to 858.4 million euros ($1.1
billion) in the first half, while profit after tax rose 6
percent, Cavan, Ireland-based Kingspan said in a statement.  “A feature of the first half results, which were
comfortably better than expected, was the strong initial
contributions from 2012 acquisitions,” said Flor O’Donoghue, an
analyst at Dublin-based stockbroker Davy. “Kingspan is on track
to achieve earnings growth well above sector norms this year.”  Chief Executive Officer Gene Murtagh said in a telephone
interview he is “fairly confident” that a pick-up in sales
momentum in the second quarter will continue as its order book
improves. Kingspan bought ThyssenKrupp Construction and Rigidal
Industries LLC in the  United Arab Emirates  in the second half of
last year.  Sales on a constant currency basis and before acquisitions
dropped 3 percent. About 187,220 shares traded hands in Dublin,
the equivalent of 60 percent of average daily trading volume for
the last three months. The company was the second-best performer
on the benchmark ISEQ index.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
