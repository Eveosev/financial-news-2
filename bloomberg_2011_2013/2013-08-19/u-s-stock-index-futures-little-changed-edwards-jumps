He helps oversee about $400 billion “I think rallies are for selling on a trading basis, but remain quite bullish on the longer-term.”  The  S&P 500  declined 2.1 percent last week and the Dow average lost 2.2 percent, the largest weekly drop in 14 months, amid speculation the Fed will pare its bond-purchase program as the economy recovers.
