Ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures
strengthened as the U.S.’s largest refinery, Motiva Enterprises
LLC’s plant in Port Arthur,  Texas , was said to be operating
several units at reduced rates during repairs.  Futures rose as much as 0.7 percent. Motiva’s 600,000-barrel-a-day  site  will operate four hydrotreaters and three lube
units at reduced rates while a sulfur recovery unit remains shut
for repairs after its reactor caught fire Aug. 12, according to
a person familiar with operations at the plant.  “Motiva’s generally geared toward distillate production,”
said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in
Houston. “This coming as refinery maintenance is going to start
up in October and even September is putting pressure on the
distillate market.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery rose 1.64
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $3.0995 a gallon on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 9:54 a.m. Trading volume was 22 percent
above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
gained 91 cents to $22.94 a barrel. The October contract’s
 premium over Brent  increased 36 cents to $19.76 a barrel.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 0.47 cent to $2.9722 a
gallon on the Nymex on trading volume that was little changed
from the 100-day average.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude gained 39 cents to $17.57 a barrel. October
gasoline’s  premium  over Brent widened 12 cents to $9.27 a
barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.2 cent to $3.538 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Prices are 18.2 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
