Soybeans rallied to the highest
level in almost a month, extending the biggest weekly advance in
more than a year, on concern that dry weather in the Midwest may
curb yields. Corn and wheat gained.  The oilseed for November delivery gained as much as 2
percent to $12.85 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since July 23, and was at $12.83 at 10:18 a.m. in
 Singapore . Prices surged 6.5 percent last week, the most since
the period ended July 20, 2012.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of eight agricultural
commodities slumped 18 percent this year as soybeans dropped 9
percent on expectations that U.S. production will rebound from
drought last year. Dry weather is expected to continue across
the west-central Midwest for the next 10 days and moisture
shortages and stress will build for soybeans and corn, MDA
Information Systems LLC said in an Aug. 16 report.  “There’s dryness starting to creep back in in parts of the
Midwest,” said  Paul Deane , an agricultural economist at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “Export sales were
strong last week for soybeans.”  Exporters sold 284,000 tons of soybeans to  China  for
delivery in the year starting Sept. 1, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said Aug. 16. Total net U.S. export sales of the
oilseed were 1.9 million tons in the week ended Aug. 8 from 1.1
million tons a week earlier, according to the USDA.  Farmers in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower, will
gather 3.26 billion bushels of soybeans this year, compared with
the 3.42 billion bushels forecast in July, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said Aug. 12.  Corn for December delivery surged as much as 2.5 percent to
$4.75 a bushel and traded at $4.7275. The price reached $4.7575
on Aug. 16, the highest since Aug. 1. Wheat for delivery in
December gained as much as 1.8 percent to $6.5475 a bushel and
was at $6.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
