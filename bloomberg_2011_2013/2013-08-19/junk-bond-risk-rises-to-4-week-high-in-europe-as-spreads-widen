The cost of insuring high-yield
corporate bonds against losses rose to the highest in more than
a month in  Europe  as the average spread on the debt jumped from
a three-month low.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly speculative-grade credit ratings
climbed 7.4 basis points to 417 at 9:21 a.m. in  London , the
highest since July 17. The premium investors demand to hold
junk-rated bonds instead of benchmark government debt widened 10
basis points to 392.85 basis points, the biggest jump since July
3, according to Bloomberg bond  index  data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
