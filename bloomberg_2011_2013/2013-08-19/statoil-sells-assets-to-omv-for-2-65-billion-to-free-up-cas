Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s biggest energy
company, agreed to sell assets, including stakes in the Gudrun
and Gullfaks fields, to Austria’s  OMV AG (OMV)  for $2.65 billion as it
frees up cash for new projects.  The company will reduce its stake in the two Norwegian
fields to 51 percent from more than 70 percent, the Stavanger-based company said today. Statoil will also sell all its
holdings in the Schiehallion and Rosebank fields, West of
Shetlands in the U.K.  “Through this transaction, Statoil captures value created
through asset development and unlocks capital for investment in
high return projects,” said  Helge Lund , Statoil’s president and
chief executive officer. “This includes our recent discoveries
on the Norwegian continental shelf.”  Statoil said it expects a gain from the transaction of $1.3
billion to $1.5 billion. The sale will allow the company to
redeploy about $7 billion of capital expenditure, it said.  Statoil, in which the Norwegian government owns a 67
percent stake, is seeking to increase production by an average 3
percent a year to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day by
2020. It’s expanding abroad and into unconventional resources
such as shale oil and gas to help meet its target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
