U.K. government bonds declined for a
sixth day after the  Confederation of British Industry  raised its
forecasts for the nation’s  economic growth , damping demand for
the safety of fixed-income securities.  Benchmark 10-year yields  climbed to the highest level in
two years as the data followed reports this month that showed
services, manufacturing and construction activity increased in
July. The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of two-year securities increased to the widest since
July 2011. The pound advanced to the strongest in two months
against the dollar.  “Yields are probably at the right sort of levels now based
on the data we’ve seen,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Corp. in  London . “Things are
clearly getting better but possibly not at the rate the recent
improvement in the data suggests therefore, we don’t think we’re
on a march for much higher yields.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.75 percent at 4:48 p.m. London time, the
highest since Aug. 8, 2011. The 1.75 percent bond due in
September 2022 fell 0.33, or 3.30 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,567) face amount, to 92.055.  The CBI’s quarterly forecasts see the economy expanding 1.2
percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2014, up from 1 percent and
2 percent projected in May. The London-based business lobby also
said  unemployment  -- which the  Bank of England  has set as the
key indicator for its guidance on policy -- will fall to 7.6
percent next year after staying at its current 7.8 percent at
the end of 2013.  Spread Widens  The  yield spread  of 10-year gilts over two-year securities
increased for a fifth day, expanding as much as three basis
points to 231 basis points. The difference has averaged 166
basis points during the past 12 months.  Gilts lost investors 4.7 percent this year through Aug. 16,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities
dropped 2.3 percent and Treasuries declined 3.6 percent.  Inflation-linked gilts have fallen 0.8 percent in 2013, a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows. The U.K. is scheduled
to auction 1.75 billion pounds of index-linked securities due in
November 2019 tomorrow.  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.5666 after
advancing to $1.5673, the strongest level since June 19. The
U.K. currency was little changed at 85.20 pence per euro.  Bearish Bet  Investors should sell the pound against the dollar, betting
the U.K. economic recovery isn’t sustainable, according to
Morgan Stanley strategists led by  Hans Redeker  in London.  British home  values  dropped 1.8 percent in August, the
first decline this year, property-website operator Rightmove Plc
said in a report today. Prices are still up 5.5 percent in the
past year.  “The broadening of the U.S. dollar recovery is also now
likely to be felt against sterling,” the Morgan Stanley
strategists wrote in an e-mailed note. “The latest Rightmove
house price survey has also showed the first monthly decline for
this year. Hence, we have used the rebound at the end of last
week to establish a short position at $1.5640.” A short
position is a bet an asset will decline.  The pound has strengthened 5 percent in the past six
months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
gained 2.9 percent and the dollar climbed 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
