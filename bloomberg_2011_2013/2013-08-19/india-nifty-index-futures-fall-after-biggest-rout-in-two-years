Indian (SENSEX)  stocks declined, taking the
benchmark index’s drop from its 2013 high to almost 10 percent,
amid concern that policy makers will sacrifice economic growth
as they seek to stem a record slide in the rupee.  State Bank of India  lost 2.6 percent and  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) 
slumped 5 percent. The 13-member S&P BSE Bankex tumbled 3.4
percent, taking its two-day loss to 8.8 percent, the most since
February 2009. Tractor maker  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM)  dropped to
the lowest level since September. Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. rose
for the first time in three days amid speculation a weak
currency will boost the value of its repatriated earnings. The
rupee weakened to an unprecedented 63.23 per dollar today.  The S&P BSE Sensex slid 1.6 percent to 18,307.52 at the
close, poised for a so-called correction after retreating 9.8
percent from this year’s high on July 23. Indian  equities  have
posted four weeks of losses on concern that government efforts
to support the rupee will weigh on the nation’s economy, which
grew at the slowest pace in a decade in the year ended March.
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said over the weekend that the
nation needs “fresh thinking” on economic policies.  “It’s a doom and gloom scenario out there,” Sajiv Dhawan,
managing director of brokerage JV Capital Services, told
Bloomberg TV India today. “The currency is weakening and
there’s panic at the moment. Whatever the government or the RBI
says is not creating any calm or stability.”  SBI, Mahindra  State Bank  dropped 40 rupees to 1,530.5 rupees, the lowest
close since May 2009. ICICI Bank plunged 43.25 rupees to 815.35
rupees.  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  sank 5.8 percent to 988 rupees, taking
its two-day decline to 14 percent, the most since January 2009.
Yes Bank Ltd. plunged 6.5 percent to 241.5 rupees, taking this
year’s loss to 48 percent.  Bank of Baroda  plunged 6 percent.  Mahindra & Mahindra lost 3.6 percent to 810.25 rupees. The
S&P BSE Capital Goods Index dropped its lowest close since April
2009. Ranbaxy, which gets 78 percent of its sales from abroad,
added 0.1 percent.  The Sensex’s 4 percent plunge on Aug. 16 underscored the
failure of months of measures to curb outflows, from higher
 interest rates  to gold import curbs. Foreigners sold a net $3
billion of stocks and bonds in July as slowing growth made the
economy vulnerable to a pullout of funds from  emerging markets ,
spurred by speculation the Fed will cool stimulus.  “The rupee needs to settle down and only then we will see
a resumption of funds on a sustainable basis,” Dhawan said.  Curbing Liquidity  The rupee sank 2.3 percent to 63.13 at the close, the most
since Sept. 22, 2011, amid speculation a strengthening U.S.
economy will prompt policy makers to pare the $85 billion of
monthly bond purchases as soon as next month.  The  Reserve Bank  of India since mid-July has tightened
 money supply  to steady the currency. It targeted outflows on
Aug. 14, cutting the amount local companies can invest abroad
without approval to 100 percent of their net worth from 400
percent, and saying residents can remit $75,000 each financial
year compared with a previous limit of $200,000.  India’s economy  may expand 5.5 percent in the year ending
March 2014, compared with 5 percent in the previous 12-month
period, the RBI estimates. That trails the 10-year average of
about 8 percent as well as the performance of neighbors from
Indonesia to the Philippines.  About 47 percent of Sensex companies that posted earnings
for the June quarter missed analyst estimates. That compares
with 27 percent for the March quarter, and 43 percent in the
three months ended December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has decreased 5.8 percent this year and  trades 
at 13 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index’s 10.1 times.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange tumbled
1.7 percent to 5,414.75, its lowest close since Sept. 11. India
VIX, which gauges the cost of protection against losses in the
Nifty, surged 8.3 percent, extending its 26 percent rise on Aug.
16. Volume on the Sensex was 43 percent higher than the 30-day
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
