Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras SA,
the airline created by  JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  founder David Neeleman, became the second company in  Brazil  to cancel an
initial public offering this year amid a market slump.  Barueri, Brazil-based Azul said today in regulatory filing
that it withdrew its request with securities regulators for the
share offering. The airline, which filed on May 27 for an IPO,
delayed the sale in June because of market conditions, three
people familiar with the situation said at the time. Azul was
seeking to raise as much as 1 billion reais ($415 million), one
of the people said.  The company said in an e-mailed response to questions that
it canceled the offering because of “unfavorable macroeconomic
conditions,” and it still intends to do an IPO.  The cancellation comes a week after Votorantim Cimentos SA,
Brazil’s biggest cement maker, cited market deterioration when
it pulled plans to sell as much as $3.7 billion in an IPO. The
Ibovespa has lost 16 percent this year, the most among the
world’s biggest equity benchmarks.  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, Brazil’s only publicly
traded airline, has lost 35 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
