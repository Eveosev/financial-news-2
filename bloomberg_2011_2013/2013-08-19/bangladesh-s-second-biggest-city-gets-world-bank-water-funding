Chittagong, the main port and
second-biggest city in  Bangladesh , is undergoing $185 million in
water production, sewer system and infrastructure works, almost
all of it financed by the  World Bank .  The Chittagong water and sanitation project that’s about
two years from completion was undertaken because the Bay of
Bengal city of 5 million suffers from inadequate water
production, “only able to cater to 40 percent of the total
estimated demand,” the bank said in a statement.  As there are “no water-borne sewerage systems and storm-water drainage services in Chittagong,” the bank in a project
update yesterday urged the Water and Sanitation Authority to
expedite Modunaghat’s water-treatment plant and pumping
facilities improvements “to address the widening gaps between
water demand and production in Chittagong.”  Bangladesh has “made great progress in water supply with
the widespread use of tube wells,” according to Unicef’s
website, with 97 percent of Bangladeshis having access to a
water point. Due to the discovery of arsenic in groundwater,
only 76 percent of these “can now be considered safe,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
