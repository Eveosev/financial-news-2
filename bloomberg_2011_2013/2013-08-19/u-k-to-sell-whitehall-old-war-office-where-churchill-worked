The British government plans to sell
a Ministry of Defence building in  London  where Winston Churchill
once worked in an effort to improve staff communication and save
money.  The Old War Office on Whitehall, will be put on the market
once a broker has been hired, the ministry said in a  statement 
today. The sale of the 111-year-old building will save about 8
million pounds ($13 million) a year in running costs, it said.  “The building was a focal point for military planning
throughout the major conflicts of the 20th century, housing
numerous secretaries of state, including Sir Winston
Churchill,” the statement said.  The British military is being  overhauled  to cut costs and
reduce personnel. A year ago, a panel of U.K. lawmakers urged
the government to sell office space, of which more than 200,000
square meters (2.2 million square feet) is vacant.  Workers currently in the Old War Office will move to the
ministry’s nearby main building in 2014, according to the
statement. Having workers in one building will “enable closer
working and collaboration within the department,” Defence
Secretary Philip Hammond said in the statement.  On Aug. 7, the ministry said it will sell a former
underground train station at Brompton Road that was used by
commuters until 1934 and then converted into  offices .  To contact the reporter on this story:
