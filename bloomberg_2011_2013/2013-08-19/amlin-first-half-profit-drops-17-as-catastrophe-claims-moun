Amlin Plc (AML) , the second-biggest
Lloyd’s of  London  insurer by market value, posted a 17 percent
drop in first-half profit as catastrophe claims jumped on
flooding in central  Europe .  Net income was 140.2 million pounds ($219 million) in the
first six months of 2013, compared with 168.8 million pounds a
year earlier, the London-based  insurer  said today in a statement.
The firm paid 32.2 million pounds in large catastrophe claims in
the first half, compared with zero in the same period last year.  The only major catastrophe in the period was the European
flooding in May and June, which will likely result in losses
between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion for the entire industry,
Amlin said. Renewal rates for catastrophe insurance are falling
amid increased competition from the  capital markets , with prices
likely to keep declining into next year unless there are more
natural disasters in the second half, the company said.  “There are positive trends in a number of our businesses
which will counteract downward pressure on catastrophe
reinsurance rates,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Philipps
said in the statement. “We are optimistic about the out-turn
for the full year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
