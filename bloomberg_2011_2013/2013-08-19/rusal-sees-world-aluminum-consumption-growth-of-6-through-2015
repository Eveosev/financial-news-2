World aluminum consumption will grow
6 percent this year and through 2015, according to United Co.
Rusal, the world’s largest producer of the metal.  Global aluminum consumption will reach 50 million metric
tons in 2013, the Moscow-based company said in its first-half
results  statement  today. Growth will be driven by demand in
 China , where it’s expected to rise 9.5 percent,  Asia  excluding
China, with a rise of 6 percent,  India  with an increase of 6
percent, and  North America  which is seen advancing 5 percent,
according to Rusal.  China’s consumption will be spurred on by an increase in
car production, infrastructure investments and home appliance
purchases in rural areas under a stimulus program, Roman
Andryushin, chief operating officer of Rusal’s marketing unit,
said at a teleconference.  “We are reconfirming the consumption growth of nearly 6
percent annually this year and through 2015, at least,” he said
in a presentation today.  U.S. primary aluminum demand will be stronger in the
second-half of the year due to an increase in housing starts,
and in the automotive and construction industries, Andryushin
said.  A Bloomberg Industries survey of announced capacity cuts
identifies as much as 3.2 million tons of capacity that may be
curtailed by the end of 2014. Rusal plans to shutter 357,000
tons of uneconomic capacity this year, accelerating aluminum
output cuts in the second half, according to the company.  Rising global consumption and falling capacity should lead
to a “balanced” market in 2013, Andryushin said.  Aluminum for delivery in three months dropped 1.3 percent
to $1,919.25 a ton on the London Metal Exchange by 3:40 p.m. The
metal has lost 7.4 percent this year.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
