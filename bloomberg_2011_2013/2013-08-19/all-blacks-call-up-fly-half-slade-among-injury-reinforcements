New Zealand  called up fly-half  Colin
Slade  and three rookies as injury cover for the Aug. 24 Rugby
Championship match against Australia in Wellington.  Slade, fellow back Tom Taylor and forwards Luke Whitelock
and Brad Shields will join the squad after fly-halves Aaron Cruden and Beauden Barrett, and second-rower Luke Romano got
injured in the All Blacks’ 47-29 win against the Wallabies in
Sydney two days ago.  Slade, 25, last played for top-ranked New Zealand in the
2011 Rugby World Cup quarterfinal against  Argentina . Cruden has
a sore knee and Barrett, who replaced him for the last 10
minutes in Sydney, will have a scan on a calf muscle injury
today, the team said on its website. First-choice playmaker  Dan Carter  is still recovering from a calf injury.  Taylor, Whitelock and Shields have all been part of the All
Blacks’ wider training camps this year.  The match at Westpac Stadium in five days is also the
second of three Bledisloe Cup meetings between the teams this
year. New Zealand, which has held the cup since 2002, will keep
the trophy for the 11th straight series by avoiding defeat in
either of its two home games against Australia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
