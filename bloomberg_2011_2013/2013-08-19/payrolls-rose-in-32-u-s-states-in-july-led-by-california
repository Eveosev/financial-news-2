Payrolls increased in 32 U.S. states
in July, and the unemployment rate climbed in 28, indicating
progress in the labor market remains uneven.  California  led the nation with a 38,100 gain in payrolls,
followed by Georgia with 30,900 more jobs, figures from the
Labor Department showed today in Washington.  Economic growth is projected to accelerate in the final six
months of 2013 as the effects of  federal budget  cuts and higher
taxes fade and job- and home-price gains spread across wider
swathes of the U.S. Faster hiring would help spur  consumer
spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy.  “There’s demand for workers,”  Stuart Hoffman , chief
economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh, said
before the report. “We’ll see some pickup in the economy as the
fiscal drag fades in the second half.”  Nationwide figures released on Aug. 2 showed the economy
added 162,000 workers in July after 188,000 the prior month. The
jobless rate dropped to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent.  State and local employment data are derived independently
from the national statistics, which are typically released on
the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject
to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller
surveys, thus making the national figures more reliable,
according to the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The differences can be seen in the unemployment figures,
with the state data showing the national average rising to 7.5
percent last month from 7.4 percent in June. Additionally,
states with some of the biggest gains in payrolls also showed an
increase in joblessness.  Jobless Rates  The  unemployment rate  in California climbed to 8.7 percent
in July from 8.5 percent the prior month, while Georgia’s shot
up to 8.8 percent from 8.5 percent in June. Other states showing
statistically significant increases in their jobless rates
included Alaska, Iowa, Nebraska, Vermont and  Virginia .
Mississippi was the only state showing a significant drop, with
the rate falling to 8.5 percent from 9 percent.  Nevada remained the state with the highest level of
unemployment at 9.5 percent, followed by  Illinois  at 9.2
percent. North Dakota had the lowest at 3 percent.  Other states showing gains in payrolls included Florida,
with an increase of 27,600, and  Michigan , which showed an
advance of 21,400.  Payrolls declined by 7,300 in New York and by 11,800 in  New
Jersey . Nonetheless, New Jersey’s jobless rate fell to 8.6
percent from 8.7 percent.  Sequestration, or the automatic across-the-board federal
budget cuts that started taking effect in March, may have played
a role in last month’s job count. Maryland lost 9,200 jobs from
payrolls and the  District of Columbia  saw a 1,600 reduction. The
jobless rate increased in both regions. Payrolls in Virginia
climbed for the first time in three months, rising by 1,400. At
the same time, its jobless rate increased to 5.7 percent from
5.5 percent in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
