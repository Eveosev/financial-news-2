Treasuries fell, pushing yields to
the highest level since 2010 relative to their Group of Seven
peers, on speculation a strengthening economy will lead the
 Federal Reserve  to trim its bond-buying program next month.  Treasuries dropped for a third day, the longest streak
since June, before the Fed issues the minutes of last month’s
meeting on Aug. 21. Ten-year securities yielded 42 basis points
more than bonds in an index of G-7 debt, the most since May
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  and his fellow policy makers on the  Federal Open Market
Committee  are scheduled to meet again on Sept. 17-18.  “Everyone is concerned about this FOMC meeting,” said Kim Youngsung, the head of fixed income in  Seoul  at Samsung Asset
Management Co.,  South Korea ’s largest private bond investor with
the equivalent of $101.6 billion in assets. “Bernanke is going
to taper in September.  Interest rates  are going up.”  Yields on U.S. 10-year notes advanced four basis points to
2.86 percent as of 6:42 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.5 percent note due in
August 2023 fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 96
7/8.  Yields (USGG30YR)  touched 2.87 percent, the most since July 2011. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  U.S. government securities due in 10 years and longer
plunged 11 percent in the 12 months ended Aug. 16, the biggest
loss of 174 debt indexes tracked by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Japan ’s 10-year rate rose one basis point to 0.765 percent
today. Long-term  government bonds  in the nation returned 3.2
percent in the past year, based on the EFFAS indexes.  Fed Signs  Investors and analysts will be looking for clues in the
minutes on when central bankers plan to trim their $85 billion
in monthly asset purchases. Officials will probably begin to
reduce bond buying next month, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13.  Allen Lei at Hontai Life Insurance Co. said he’s unwinding
a short position, a bet against Treasuries. Yields have climbed
too far based on the outlook for Fed tapering, according to Lei,
who is based in Taipei and helps oversee the equivalent of $6.1
billion.  “The markets over-reacted,” he said. “I’ve started to
take profits on my short position.”  Yields have risen so far, so fast that trading patterns
signal they’re oversold. The 14-day  relative-strength index  for
the 10-year yield has risen above the 70 threshold that
indicates it has climbed too much. The last time it exceeded
that level was July 5 and preceded a two-week rally in
Treasuries.  Next Chairman  Bonds also slid last week on concern former Treasury
Secretary  Larry Summers  will win out over Fed Vice Chairman
 Janet Yellen  as the next head of the central bank, according to
Jefferies LLC. Bernanke’s term ends in January.  “The growing conviction that Larry Summers as Fed Chairman
should be equated with an accelerated rate of tapering has been
the primary catalyst to the recent distress in both the bond and
stock markets,”  Ward McCarthy , the chief financial economist at
Jefferies, wrote in a Aug. 16 report. The company is one of the
21 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed.  The increase in  yields  pushed them to a two-year high
relative to dividends of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  The spread between 10-year Treasuries and the S&P 500
dividend yield widened to 72 basis points, the most since August
2011. The S&P 500 dividend yield was 2.11 percent. The index has
fallen for two weeks after climbing to a record on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
