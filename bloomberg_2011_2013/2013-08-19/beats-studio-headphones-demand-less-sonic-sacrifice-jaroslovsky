Beats has never been just about the sound. From the beginning, the iconic headphones -- the work of rap legend Dr. Dre and producer-impresario Jimmy Iovine -- have been as much a lifestyle statement as a musical accessory. But the 2013 version of the  Beats Studio  headphones, the first since the company split from former manufacturing partner Monster, puts new emphasis on the sonic side of things. The skull-rattling bass is still there, of course, but these Beats deliver reasonably satisfying performance on other types of music, too. For this new edition, the Studios have been extensively redesigned. Gone are the replaceable AAA batteries; these headphones are powered by a sealed rechargeable that works off the included AC adapter or a computer's USB port. You should get about 20 hours of use between charges, and the headphones shut off automatically when the audio cable is removed to preserve the battery. Speaking of cables, Beats includes two of them, one a regular audio cable and the other with a built-in microphone for use with a smartphone. The power adapter and cable, a hard-shell carrying case and even a cleaning cloth (the glossy finish is something of a fingerprint magnet) make for a pleasingly complete package -- which you have a right to expect, given the hefty $300 price tag.  The build is heavy on the plastic, at least for my taste, but the headphones feel solid and are light enough and comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time. They also feature adaptive noise cancellation, though I found them nowhere near as tomb-like as my usual Bose QuietComfort cans. But you don't buy these to shut out sound. You buy them to ingest it. And they do a pretty good job of it. Compared with the previous generation, the new Studios seem clearer and a little brighter in the middle ranges; I found myself picking up nuances in even very familiar music. And of course the performance on bass-heavy tunes, even jazz, was deep and solid. Are these recommended for audiophiles? No, but then again, audiophiles aren't the target audience. For those who are, the new Studio headphones mean you won't have to sacrifice as much sound for style.
