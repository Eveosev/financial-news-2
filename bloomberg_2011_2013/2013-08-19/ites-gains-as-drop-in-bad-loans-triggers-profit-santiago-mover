Empresas Hites SA (HITES) , a Chilean
department store operator, rose for a seventh day today, its
longest streak since February, after declining defaults on its
in-store credit cards boosted profits.  The stock advanced 2.5 percent to 446 pesos, the highest
price in almost four months. It has gained 20 percent in the
past seven days, compared with a 1 percent advance in the
benchmark IPSA index over that time.  “Hites has been rising on its quarterly results,” Aldo Morales, an analyst at BICE Inversiones, said in an e-mailed
response to questions. “Provisions at its credit business fell
significantly and its stores posted higher margins.”  Hites reported Aug. 12 in a regulatory  filing  that its
second-quarter profit rose 34 percent to 4.29 billion pesos
($8.3 million) from 3.2 billion pesos a year earlier. Provisions
to cover for non-performing loans at its in-store credit card
operation, which accounted for 74 percent of earnings before
items in the quarter, fell 12 percent from a year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
