Tin shipments from  Indonesia  slumped
the most in eighteen months in July, dropping more than expected
to the lowest level since last August, as new purity standards
in the world’s largest exporter came into force.  Shipments fell 42 percent to 6,465.95 metric tons from
11,111.38 tons in June, data from the Trade Ministry showed
today. That’s the steepest drop since a 64 percent plunge in
January 2012 and compared with sales of 8,298.47 tons in July
2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Exports exceeded the 28
percent drop forecast in a survey published July 31.  Declining supplies may help extend a rally in the price of
the metal from a near one-year low in July. Sales in June jumped
to the highest level since December 2011 before the new
standards took effect July 1. The rules, which were not as
severe as initially planned, raised the minimum tin-content
limit to 99.9 percent from 99.85 percent.  The drop in exports “is more than people had expected,”
said M.B. Gunawan, president director at smelter PT Stanindo
Inti Perkasa. “The smelters either ran out of stockpiles after
releasing them in June or they just couldn’t meet the rule.”  Tin futures for delivery in three months fell 1.3 percent
to $21,655 a ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3:01 p.m.
Singapore time. The metal used in soldering and packaging, which
touched $18,809 on July 5, has tumbled 7.5 percent this year.  Exports may remain low in August as smelters curb sales
because of low prices, President Director Sukrisno of PT Timah,
the world’s third-biggest producer, said Aug. 15. Last month’s
shipments were the lowest since the country sold 5,645.87 tons
in August 2012.  Indonesia shipped tin to 14 countries in July, with
Singapore taking 55 percent of the total, according to the
ministry’s data, based on surveyors’ reports prior to shipments.
Other destinations included Taiwan, Malaysia and  Japan .  Exports in the first seven months of the year rose 10.5
percent to 61,477 tons, according to Bloomberg calculations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
