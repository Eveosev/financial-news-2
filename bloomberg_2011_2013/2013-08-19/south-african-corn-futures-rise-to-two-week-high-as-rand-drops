South African corn and wheat futures
gained to the highest level in more than two weeks as the rand
depreciated against the dollar, making imports for the grain
more expensive.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract,
rose 0.4 percent to 2,346 rand ($231) a metric ton, the highest
since Aug. 2, by the midday close in Johannesburg. The yellow
variety for delivery in the same month added 0.7 percent to
2,194.20 rand a ton. Wheat for delivery in December increased
0.9 percent to 3,345 rand a ton, also a two-week high.  South Africa’s rand slumped to a six-week low against the
dollar on concern capital outflows from  emerging markets  will
accelerate as the  Federal Reserve  reduces monetary stimulus. The
currency slipped 0.6 percent to 10.15 by midday.  “Corn prices went up on the weakness of the rand,”
Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader at Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd.,
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Meal made from white corn is a staple South African food,
while the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed . The
country is sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest producer of wheat after
Ethiopia, and the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria,
 Sudan , according to U.S. Dept. of Agriculture data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
