Peru  had its  credit rating  increased
one level by  Standard & Poor’s , climbing above Brazil and
Mexico, as mining and energy investment fuels growth in the
Andean economy.  Peru’s long-term foreign-currency rating, which applies to
its bonds denominated in euros and dollars, rose to BBB+, or
three levels above junk grade, S&P said today in a statement.
The outlook is stable.  High growth has allowed Peru’s government to boost savings
and cut debt, making the country less vulnerable to a drop in
export prices and other external shocks, according to S&P. The
upgrade makes Peru the highest-ranked major Latin American
economy after Chile, which is four levels higher at AA-. Brazil
and  Mexico  are a level lower at BBB.  “The public sector debt burden will remain low and likely
decline moderately in the next three years,” S&P said.
“Foreign direct investment is likely to fully or largely fund
the country’s projected current account deficits in the next
couple of years, containing the level of external indebtedness
and allowing international reserves to continue to grow.”  Mine construction in the world’s third-largest copper
producer will account for half of an estimated $42 billion in
private investment during 2013 to 2015, according to the central
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
