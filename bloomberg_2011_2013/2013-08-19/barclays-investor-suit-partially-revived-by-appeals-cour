A previously dismissed investor
lawsuit claiming  Barclays Plc (BARC)  failed to disclose its full
credit-market risk in offerings for $5.45 billion in American
depositary shares was partly revived by an appeals court.  The federal appeals court in  Manhattan  said today that the
investors may go forward with claims over a $2.5 billion share
offering in April 2008, reversing a 2011 lower-court ruling that
they couldn’t sue over Barclays’s asset valuation and writedown
decisions. The panel agreed with the lower court that claims
based on three earlier offerings were filed too late.  A group of investors filed the suit in 2009 seeking to
represent buyers of 218 million Barclays shares at $25 each. The
investors claimed Barclays should have disclosed losses on
mortgage-backed securities as mortgage delinquencies and
defaults triggered an August 2008 writedown.  Brandon Ashcraft, a spokesman for London-based Barclays,
declined to comment on the ruling.  The case is Freidus v. Barclays Bank Plc, 11-2665,  U.S.
Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
