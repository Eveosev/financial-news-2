Enterprise Group Ltd., the second-biggest publicly traded insurer in  Ghana , slumped the most in 18
months as investors speculated the company’s year-to-date gains
have been excessive.  The stock dropped 6.1 percent to 1.7 cedis at the close in
Accra, the capital, retreating for a sixth day and dropping the
most since February 2012. The number of shares traded was 49
percent of the three-month daily average.  Enterprise has more than tripled in 2013 compared with the
benchmark GSE Composite  Index’s (GGSECI)  64 percent surge in local
currency terms. The stock has traded above its 200-day moving
average, an indicator some technical analysts use to gauge the
extent of price gains, since November.  “Considering the company’s earnings prospects, we think
the shares are overvalued,” Xorlali Torsu, a stock trader at
Databank Financial Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone today.
“Our current rating on it is sell, with an estimated fair value
of 1.66 cedis.”  The company’s net income jumped to 27.5 million cedis ($13
million) in the first half through June 30, from 6.2 million
cedis a year earlier, it said on Aug. 2. Its net investment
income advanced to 48 million cedis from 4.8 million cedis a
year earlier.  “Most of EGL’s earnings in the first half came from
investment income,” Anastacia Arko, a research analyst at
Databank said by phone today. “Investors looking for short-term
returns can sell some of their shares but the long-term earnings
potential still remains robust.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
