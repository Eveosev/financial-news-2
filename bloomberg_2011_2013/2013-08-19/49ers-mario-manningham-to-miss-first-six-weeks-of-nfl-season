San Francisco 49ers wide receiver
 Mario Manningham  will miss the first six games of the National
Football League regular season as he works his way back from two
torn ligaments in his left knee.  Manningham, 27, had surgery in December after tearing the
anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligaments in his knee
during the 49ers’ next-to-last regular season game last year.  49ers coach Jim Harbaugh said yesterday that Manningham
will start this season on the team’s physically unable to
perform list, meaning he can’t participate in games or practices
for the first six weeks.  Manningham had 42 receptions for 449 yards and one
touchdown last season, his first in San Francisco after four
years with the  New York  Giants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
