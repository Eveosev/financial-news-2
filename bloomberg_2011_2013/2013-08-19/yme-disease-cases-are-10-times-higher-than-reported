About 300,000 people are diagnosed
with Lyme disease transmitted through tick bites each year, 10
times higher than cases reported to the U.S. government.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is analyzing
medical claims data for 22 million insured people and surveying
labs and the general public to better understand the burden of
Lyme disease. Only about 30,000 cases are reported to the agency
each year, the CDC said in a  statement  today.  Lyme disease is concentrated in the U.S. Northeast and
upper Midwest, with 96 percent of cases in 13 states, the CDC
said. Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue and a “bull’s-eye” rash. The early CDC estimate supports studies published in
the 1990s indicating the true number of cases of  Lyme disease  is
three to 12 times higher than what is officially reported, the
agency said.  “We know that routine surveillance only gives us part of
the picture, and that the true number of illnesses is much
greater,” Paul Mead, chief of epidemiology and surveillance for
CDC’s Lyme disease program, said in the statement. “This new
preliminary estimate confirms that Lyme disease is a tremendous
public health problem in the  United States , and clearly
highlights the urgent need for prevention.”  Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated successfully with
a few weeks of antibiotics, the CDC said on its website. The
agency and other researchers are studying novel methods to kill
ticks and prevent the illness in people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
