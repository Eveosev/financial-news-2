Dry air and wind shear are expected
to damp tropical storm development in the Atlantic this week,
forecasters said.  None of the tropical waves moving west across the ocean
will find conditions conducive to growth, said Kyle Tapley, a
meteorologist at MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  “Overall, this week is looking quiet as far as any U.S.
impacts, for sure,” Tapley said.  Atlantic storms are followed closely by energy companies
and commodities traders because they can disrupt natural gas and
oil production and processing and destroy crops.  The Gulf of  Mexico  is home to about 6 percent of U.S.
natural gas output, 23 percent of oil production and more than
45 percent of petroleum refining capacity, according to the U.S.
Energy Department. The Bay of Campeche, at the southern end of
the Gulf, is where Petroleos Mexicanos, Mexico’s state-owned oil
company, has most of its output. Florida is the second-largest
producer of oranges after  Brazil .  Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland, and Phil Klotzbach, lead author of Colorado
State University’s seasonal hurricane forecast, also
characterized the coming week as “quiet.”  Tapley said the tropical waves, which can be seeds for
larger systems, were all moving through areas of high shear and
dry air.  Shear, or winds blowing at different directions or
different speeds at varying altitudes, can cripple tropical
systems by tearing at their structure. Dry air can rob a
potential storm of much-needed moisture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
