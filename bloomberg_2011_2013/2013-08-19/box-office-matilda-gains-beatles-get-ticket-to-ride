“Matilda” advanced on “Wicked” in the battle for girls on Broadway last week, as the acclaimed British import set another house record.  “Annie” and “Rodgers + Hammerstein’s Cinderella” -- vying for the same audience (or at least their parents) -- each slumped more than $100,000 to multi-month lows.  “Matilda” took in $1.33 million in the seven days ending on Sunday. It was the musical’s best week since previews began on March 4 at the Shubert Theatre, according to figures released Monday by the Broadway League, a trade association of theater owners, producers and general managers.  The revival of “Annie” at the Palace fell to $807,000 and “Cinderella” at the Broadway dipped to $981,000. It was both shows’ smallest take since the beginning of June.  Overall, Broadway sales declined 6 percent to $21.8 million.  “Let It Be” hit a new low, $317,000, and its producers announced that the Beatles tribute will close on Sept. 1, four months early.  Another vulnerable show, “Soul Doctor,” took in $201,000, about a quarter of selling potential at the Circle in the Square Theater. The show opened to mixed notices despite some acclaim for the actors playing singing rabbi Shlomo Carlebach and jazz singer Nina Simone.  ‘First Date’  “First Date” was little changed at $424,000, less than half of its potential.  “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” lost ground when one of the actors in the title role was injured mid-performance and the show was canceled,. Its weekly take dropped to $1 million.  At the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, “Kinky Boots” did $1.65 million, besting its own record for the sixth time since winning the best musical Tony Award. Its $143.64 average seat is the highest among new shows on Broadway.  That’s even higher than the $134.80 average price people are paying to see “Wicked,” the ongoing blockbuster at the Gershwin Theatre. At $199, “The Book of Mormon” continued its reign as Broadway’s most expensive average ticket.  Muse highlights include Jeffrey Burke on  books  and  James S. Russell  on architecture.
