U.K. stocks  fell to their lowest
level in more than a month as mining shares dropped and Treasury
yields jumped on speculation the Federal Reserve will reduce its
bond purchases next month.  Glencore Xstrata Plc dropped 2.1 percent after Reuters
reported that the mining company created three months ago may
write down as much as $7 billion of assets it inherited from
Xstrata.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group each declined
more than 1.5 percent as copper slid.  The FTSE 100 decreased 34.26 points, or 0.5 percent, to
6,465.73 at the close in  London . The equity benchmark declined
1.3 percent last week, its biggest drop since June, as
speculation mounted that the Fed will reduce the pace of bond
buying as the U.S. economy improves. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index slipped 0.4 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
climbed 0.4 percent.  “People want to take some money off the table, be a little
more defensive,” Espen Furnes, who helps oversee $75 billion at
Storebrand Asset Management in Oslo, said by telephone. “The
reporting season is more or less done, so we’re in for a couple
of months of a lot of macro news and, therefore, things will be
more volatile.”  The volume of shares changing hands in  FTSE-100 (UKX)  listed
companies was 27 percent lower than the 100-day average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Fed Minutes  Yields on  10-year Treasuries (USGG10YR)  jumped four basis points to
2.87 percent and yielded 39 basis points more than bonds in an
index of debt from the Group of Seven nations, the most since
May 2010.  Investors will scrutinize the minutes from the Federal Open
Market Committee’s July 30-31 meeting for anything that may
indicate when the U.S. central bank will reduce the pace of its
$85 billion of monthly bond purchases. The minutes will probably
set out the risks from inflation falling below the Fed’s 2
percent goal.  “The Fed tapering issue is well known and well flagged,”
Furnes said. “Tapering news will bring further volatility, but
it won’t break the market.”  Glencore Xstrata slid 2.1 percent to 301.95 pence. The
mining company may announce the writedowns when it reports its
 first-half earnings  tomorrow, according to Reuters, which cited
analysts and a person in the industry it didn’t identify.  BHP Billiton lost 1.6 percent to 1,956 pence and Rio Tinto
dropped 1.6 percent to 3,055 pence. A gauge of mining companies
posted the biggest decline of the 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, losing 1.8 percent. Copper fell from its
highest price since June 5.  Kentz Soars  Kentz Corp. surged 24 percent to 591 pence, the highest
price since its initial public offering in 2008. The oilfield-services provider rejected a takeover offer of 565 pence to 580
pence a share from  Amec Plc (AMEC) , according to a statement. The
approach valued Kentz at as much as 680 million pounds ($1.1
billion). Three people familiar with the matter said that Kentz
has received interest from several potential buyers. The
company, which is based in Tipperary, Ireland, said it had
rejected an offer from M&W Group GmbH.  Rightmove Plc (RMV)  climbed 4.4 percent to 2,364 pence. Westhouse
Securities Ltd. upgraded the owner of the largest residential
property website to add from neutral, meaning that investors
should hold more of the shares than are represented in benchmark
indexes. Analyst Roddy Davidson said that better-than-expected
revenue per advertiser in the first half and the company’s
positive outlook supported speculation the housing market is
improving. The brokerage lifted its 12-month price target to
2,570 pence from 1,793 pence.  Moneysupermarket.com Group Plc (MONY)  gained 3.4 percent to 166
pence. Westhouse’s Davidson upgraded the price-comparison
website to buy from neutral. He cited the company’s cash
generation and the shares’ recent slide. Moneysupermarket has
 slumped 25 percent  from its highest price this year on May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
