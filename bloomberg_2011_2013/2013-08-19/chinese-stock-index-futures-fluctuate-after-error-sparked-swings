China’s stocks  rose for the first
time in four days as communication shares and rare-earth
producers rallied after the government said it will expand the
country’s broadband network. Brokerages declined.  ZTE Corp. (000063)  and Yonyou Software Co. jumped by the 10 percent
daily limit. Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co.
advanced 8 percent. Citic Securities Co. and  Southwest

Securities was suspended.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.8 percent to 2,085.60

 Shanghai  gauge. The index jumped on Aug. 16 from a loss of as
much as 1 percent to a gain of 5.6 percent in two minutes during
the morning session, then ended the day with a 0.6 percent drop.  “Technology companies are benefiting from government
efforts to boost the industry,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist
at Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai. “The market is lowering
expectations about the development of brokerages’ proprietary
trading business.”  The CSI 300 Index added 1.2 percent to 2,331.43. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slipped 0.2 percent.  Broadband Plan  The Shanghai Composite has tumbled about 40 percent from
its August 2009 high, erasing about $644 billion in market
value, as the world’s second-largest economy slowed and local
investors emptied more than 2 million equity trading accounts.

percent to 21.18 yuan. Yonyou Software jumped to 13.89 yuan,
taking its 2013 advance to 41 percent.  The government will boost spending on fiber optic and
wireless networks to ensure half of households have broadband
access by 2015 and a third of cellular users have access to
third-generation or other fast networks, according to a
statement on the government’s website over the weekend.  Zhou Comments  Baotou Rare-Earth, China’s biggest producer of rare earth,
surged 8 percent to 30.16 yuan.  China Minmetals Rare Earth Co. (000831) 
gained 5.6 percent to 27.13 yuan.  “China’s economic situation is ‘‘good’’ and economic
growth of 7.5 percent is at a ‘‘normal level,’’ People’s Bank of

Everbright Ltd., which has a stake in the brokerage, slid 1.6
percent in  Hong Kong .  The China Securities Regulatory Commission has started an
official investigation into Everbright Securities, the watchdog
said. The brokerage reported a mark-to-market loss of about 194
million yuan ($31.7 million) based on Aug. 16 closing prices and
said the final loss may change.  Everbright Securities’ trading system placed an accumulated
23.4 billion yuan of buy orders, of which 7.27 billion yuan was
transacted. The brokerage sold 1.85 billion yuan in exchange-traded funds, along with short-selling 7,130 contracts of index
futures, according to the CSRC. The regulator has temporarily
banned the brokerage from conducting proprietary trading, the
company said.  Short Contracts  Everbright Futures Co., a wholly-owned unit of  Everbright
Securities (601788) , held on Aug. 16 10,194 short contracts in the CSI
300 expiring next month, the most among futures brokerages,
according to data from the China Financial Futures Exchange.  New home prices climbed in 69 of the 70 cities the
government tracked last month from a year earlier, the National
Bureau of Statistics said, matching data for May and June.  The southern city of Guangzhou posted the biggest advance,
rising 17 percent from a year earlier, while prices in Beijing
and Shanghai both increased 14 percent. All three cities had
their biggest gains since the government changed its methodology
for the data in January 2011.  Bo Xilai, the former Politburo member charged with bribery
and abuse of power, will go on trial on Aug. 22, bringing the
Communist Party’s biggest scandal in more than 20 years a step
closer to its conclusion.  Bo will face trial in the eastern city of Jinan in Shandong
province, the official Xinhua News Agency said yesterday. He
will face charges of bribery, graft and abuse of power,
