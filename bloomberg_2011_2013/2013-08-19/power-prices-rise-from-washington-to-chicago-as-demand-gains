Spot wholesale electricity prices
rose from  Washington  to Chicago as demand gained for the first
time in three days.  Prices reversed earlier losses on the 13-state PJM
Interconnection LLC network as consumption increased for the
first time in three days. Demand averaged 107,277 megawatts
during the hour ended at 2 p.m., up 7.8 percent from the same
time on Aug. 16, PJM data show.  Temperatures in the Northeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic
and Midwestern states will be more seasonal this week following
cooler readings last week, according to Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  Spot on-peak power  for PJMâ€™s benchmark Western hub, which
includes deliveries to Washington, rose $5.42, or 17 percent, to
$37.07 a megawatt-hour as of 2 p.m. from the same time on Aug.
16, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed. On-peak hours are
Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m.  The high in Chicago today may be 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28
Celsius), 1 above normal, and Newark, New Jersey, will be 1
lower than the average at 83 degrees, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  On-peak prices were up for a third day in  New York City 
amid higher demand, rising $2.20, or 6.1 percent, to $40.13 a
megawatt-hour.  Boston prices  slumped $1.76, or 5.8 percent, to
