  QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE) ,
 Australia ’s largest insurer by market value, posted a 37 percent
fall in first-half net income as premiums fell in North America
and it set aside more for unresolved claims.  Net income  dropped to $477 million in the six months ended
June 30 from $760 million for the year earlier period, the
Sydney-based insurer said in a statement today. That missed a
$555 million median estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News .  Chief Executive Officer John Neal, who took up his position
a year ago, is targeting cost cuts by reducing jobs and
simplifying processes at the insurer, which has made 135
acquisitions in the past 30 years to expand to 48 countries. He
plans to save at least $250 million annually by 2015 through a
restructuring program that the company estimates will cost $156
million this year.  “The key for QBE is proof of recovery in their underlying
business across the board after the recent spate of claims
losses and provisioning.”  Andrew Adams, a Sydney-based analyst
at Credit Suisse Group AG said before the announcement.  QBE in February wrote off $407 million for amortization and
impairments largely on its U.S. operation pushing it to miss its
full-year profit forecast, filings show.  The insurer said today it was disappointed in having to set
aside $178 million for prior year claims while gross written
premiums from its North American operations dropped 16 percent.  “Plans are underway to rebuild our premium base in the
specialist U.S. lender placed insurance business,” Neal said in
today’s statement.  North America  Reflecting the weakness in  North America , QBE cut its gross
written premium target for the year to between $17.5 billion and
$18 billion from its earlier forecast of $18.5 billion to $19
billion.  QBE’s latest result includes a loss of $24 million on its
fixed-income investments in the first-half compared with a gain
of $259 million a year earlier when it revalued its bond
portfolio.  The insurer expects an insurance profit margin of 11
percent for the full year after a margin of 10.8 percent in the
first half, it said.  QBE  shares  have climbed 56.2 percent this year compared to
a 10 percent gain for the  benchmark S&P/ASX200 index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
