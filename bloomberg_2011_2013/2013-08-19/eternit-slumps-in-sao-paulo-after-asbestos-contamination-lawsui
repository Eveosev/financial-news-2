Eternit SA (ETER3) , a Brazilian construction
materials manufacturer, fell as prosecutors said they would seek
as much as 1 billion reais ($420 million) of compensation on
behalf of workers exposed to asbestos.  Eternit’s shares  fell  3.3 percent to 9.40 reais at 3:23
p.m. in Sao Paulo after earlier declining as much as 4.3 percent
in the steepest intraday drop since June 20. The benchmark
Ibovespa index  added  0.1 percent.  The Public Ministry of Labor demanded that Eternit
compensate workers of an Osasco, Sao Paulo, plant and provide
medical treatment, according to a  statement  on the prosecutors’
website. More than 10,000 workers may have been affected. The
amount claimed is more than Eternit’s market value of 853.8
million reais as of today.  Eternit, based in Sao Paulo, said in a regulatory filing
that it wasn’t notified of the lawsuit.  The civil charges were filed with the labor court in Sao
Paulo, and there’s no estimate when the case will be heard,
according to the prosecutors’ statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
