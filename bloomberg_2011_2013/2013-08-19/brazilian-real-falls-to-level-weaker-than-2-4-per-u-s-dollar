Brazil’s real weakened to a level
weaker than 2.4 per dollar for the first time since March 2009
on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will curtail a stimulus
program that has boosted emerging-market assets.  The currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 2.4062 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:52 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The currency fell 2.2 percent
on Aug. 16, the biggest drop since May 2012. Swap rates on the
contract due in January 2015 climbed 26 basis points, or 0.26
percentage point, to 10.59 percent today.  Brazil’s currency has lost 15 percent in the past three
months, boosting the cost of imports and adding to inflation
that already exceeds central bank targets. The real’s decline to
a 4 1/2-year low last week prompted the central bank to announce
that it will roll over more than $5 billion in currency swap
contracts designed to limit losses.  “The volatility in Brazil’s currency markets has made
clear that we are witnessing a faster-than-expected adjustment
of investors’ portfolio positions to the prospects of monetary
normalization in the U.S.,”  Tony Volpon , director of emerging-market research for the Americas at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote
in a research report. “The need for investors to rebalance
portfolios will temporarily lead to an ‘overshoot’ in the
nominal  exchange rate .”  The real will end 2013 at 2.3 per dollar, according to the
median forecast of a central bank survey of economists published
today, weaker than 2.28 per dollar projected a week ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
