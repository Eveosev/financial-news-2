The decision to require  New York 
City police officers to wear miniature video cameras should be
made by the police commissioner and not by a judge or
legislators, Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  said.  U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin on Aug. 12 said the
city’s stop-and-frisk tactic unlawfully targets minorities,
appointed an independent monitor to oversee changes and ordered
a pilot program requiring police to wear video cameras in some
areas. The city has appealed the ruling, which came following a
nine-week non-jury trial in a lawsuit over the practice.  Video cameras have only been tried in “a few very small
police departments” with environments “totally different”
from New York, the mayor said today during a press conference
announcing what authorities said was the largest seizure of
illegal guns in city history.  “It should be the police commissioner deciding what
tactics work and not the judicial part of government or the
legislative part of government,” Bloomberg said. “Their jobs
are to set policies or interpret laws. It’s the job of the
executive branch to implement and decide on tactics, and that’s
what this is about.”  The mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
LP, the parent company of  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
