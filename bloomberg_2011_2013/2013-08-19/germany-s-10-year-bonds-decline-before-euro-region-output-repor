Italian  government bonds  fell, with
10-year yields rising the most in eight weeks, as speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will reduce asset purchases damped the
outlook for the global recovery.  Spanish, Belgian and Dutch securities also declined as the
Bundesbank said the  European Central Bank  may raise interest
rates if inflation pressure increases, even as the central bank
pledges to keep borrowing costs low. German  10-year yields  rose
to the highest in almost 17 months before the Fed releases the
minutes of its July meeting this week that may provide clues as
to whether it will start to reduce debt purchases as soon as its
Sept. 17-18 gathering.  “The market is increasingly confident that the Fed will
taper at its next meeting,” said  Richard McGuire , a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “That
expectation of stimulus reduction is negative for risk in a
broad sense. Periphery spreads may widen as the market becomes
more sensitive to fundamental drivers.”  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.28 percent at 4:49 p.m. London time, the
biggest increase since June 24. The 4.5 percent bond maturing in
May 2023 dropped 0.72, or 7.20 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,335)
face amount, to 102.10.  Similar-maturity Spanish yields increased five basis points
to 4.41 percent after declining to 4.36 percent on Aug. 16, the
lowest level since May 31.  Fed Tapering  The Fed’s first step may be tapering monthly debt purchases
in September by $10 billion to a $75 billion pace, according to
a Bloomberg survey concluded last week. The central bank will
end its asset buying in the middle of 2014, according to the
median estimate of 48 economists in the Aug. 9-13 survey.  The ECB’s commitment to keep rates low “is not an
imperative statement, and it doesn’t represent a change” in the
monetary-policy stance, the German central bank said in its
monthly report. “Forward guidance doesn’t rule out an increase
in the benchmark rate if greater inflation pressure emerges.”  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said in July for the first time
that the central bank will keep interest rates at current levels
or lower for an extended period of time. He reiterated his
statement this month, trying to assure investors that the ECB
won’t tighten policy too soon after it cut its  main refinancing
rate  to a record-low 0.5 percent in May.  Draghi ‘Expectations’  Germany’s 10-year bund yield climbed two basis points to
1.90 percent after increasing to 1.92 percent, the highest level
since March 27, 2012.  Benchmark bund yields jumped 20 basis points last week, the
most since the period ended June 21, as a report showed the
euro-area emerged from recession in the second quarter, damping
speculation ECB policy makers will cut  interest rates  to
encourage growth.  “Last week’s story for me was about  Europe ’s recovery,”
said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at
 Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “The expectations about
whether Draghi would deliver another rate cut was affected by
the numbers last week.”  France  allotted 7.2 billion euros of bills today, while the
Netherlands sold 3.01 billion euros of short-dated securities.  Volatility on Belgian securities was the highest in euro-area markets today, followed by those of Austria and  Greece ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Belgium’s 10-year yield rose six basis points to 2.74
percent after reaching 2.75 percent, the most since June 26.
Dutch 10-year yields climbed five basis points to 2.30 percent,
after reaching 2.33 percent, the  highest  since April 2012.  Italy’s securities returned 4.6 percent this year through
Aug. 16, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
earned 8.2 percent, while German bonds declined 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
