An  Oklahoma  law requiring people
under 17 to get a prescription for an emergency “morning-after” contraceptive pill was temporarily blocked by a state-court judge.  Judge Lisa T. Davis in Oklahoma City today granted a
request by the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights to
enjoin enforcement of the measure, according to the court’s
electronic docket.  Lawyers for the center argued in court papers that the law
discriminated against women and attacked it on procedural
grounds. Because it was the second topic in a bill signed into
law by Governor Mary Fallin on May 29, it violated the state
constitution’s “single subject” rule, the center said.  “Oklahoma women may rest assured that they will not be
denied access to this important means of preventing unintended
pregnancy,” an attorney for the center, David Brown, said in a
statement after the court’s ruling.  Diane Clay, a spokeswoman for state Attorney General E. Scott Pruitt, did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request
for comment.  The case is Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice v.
Oklahoma State Board of Pharmacy, CV-2013-1640, Oklahoma County,
Oklahoma, District Court (Oklahoma City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
