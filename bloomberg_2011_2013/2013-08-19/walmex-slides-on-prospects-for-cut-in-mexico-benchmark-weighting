Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB ,  Latin
America ’s largest retailer, fell the most in a year after the
stock exchange said the company’s weighting in  Mexico ’s
benchmark index may be cut next month.  Walmex declined 4.2 percent to 34.06 pesos at the close in
Mexico City trading, the biggest drop on a closing basis since
Aug. 15, 2012.  America Movil SAB (AMXL) , which also could see its
 weighting  reduced, lost 2.8 percent. The benchmark IPC index
retreated 1.3 percent.  The exchange released on Aug. 16 its preliminary estimates
of the updated weightings, which are scheduled to go into effect
Sept. 2. The new levels take into account revised estimates for
the number of shares each issuer has trading in the open market,
known as free float. Final figures will be released Aug. 29.  Mexico City-based Walmex will probably drop to a 7.3
percent weighting on the IPC, from 9.7 percent now, according to
the statement.  America Movil  will likely fall to 15.9 percent
from 17.4 percent.  Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, Latin America’s biggest
convenience store operator, will probably see its weighting rise
to 10.7 percent from 9.1 percent. Its shares rallied 3.5 percent
today, the most on the IPC.  Other stocks getting a boost include lender Grupo
Financiero Banorte SAB, which will probably rise to 8.1 percent
from 7.1 percent. Its shares climbed 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
