Novak Djokovic and  Andy Murray , who
have faced each other in three of the past four Grand Slam
tennis finals, will play an exhibition match at New York’s
Madison Square Garden in March.  The two 26-year-olds will meet March 3 as part of the 2014
BNP Paribas Showdown, MSG spokesman Larry Torres said today in
an e-mail. Djokovic, of Serbia, is the top-ranked player on the
 ATP Tour ; Murray, of Britain, is ranked No. 3.  The night will also include a doubles match between a pair
of brothers -- Bob and  Mike Bryan  against John and Patrick McEnroe. The Bryan twins are the world’s top-ranked doubles
team, with a record 15 Grand Slam titles. Both McEnroe brothers
won Grand Slam doubles titles in the 1980s, with John also
winning seven singles championships.  The annual BNP Paribas Showdown typically features high-profile current and former tennis players, and has been held
since 2008 at Madison Square Garden. This year,  Serena Williams 
faced Victoria Azarenka and Juan Martin del Potro faced  Rafael Nadal .  Tickets for next year’s event will go on sale Nov. 4.  Murray defeated Djokovic in the finals of the  U.S. Open 
last year and in July at Wimbledon, where he became the first
British man in 77 years to win the tournament. Djokovic, who has
been the top-ranked player on the ATP Tour since November, beat
Murray in the Australian Open final this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
