Promotora y Operadora de
Infraestructura SAB, Mexico’s best-performing construction
company in 2013, fell the most in four years as Credit Suisse
Group AG cut its recommendation to the equivalent of hold.  Shares of  Pinfra (PINFRA*) , as the company is also known, fell 6.1
percent to 129.30 pesos at 1:15 p.m. in Mexico City trading, the
biggest drop on a closing basis since February 2009. The
benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican companies, which Pinfra will
join Sept. 2 in an annual revision of the market gauge, declined
0.9 percent today.  Credit Suisse analysts said in a research note to clients
that while Pinfra is a “strong operator,” the target price of
129.69 pesos for the company indicates a 6 percent drop from
last week’s close. The bank reduced its recommendation to
neutral from outperform.  “Market levels have outrun market fundamentals,” Credit
Suisse’s Eugenio Amador, Julian Bravo and Bruno Savaris wrote in
the research note.  Pinfra, which is based in  Mexico  City, rallied 60 percent
this year through last week, beating infrastructure peers OHL
Mexico SAB and Empresas ICA SAB as its 4.43 billion peso ($340
million) follow-on boosted trading. Since the Oct. 4 offering,
three-month average volume has tripled to 709,000 shares a day
and the price has doubled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
