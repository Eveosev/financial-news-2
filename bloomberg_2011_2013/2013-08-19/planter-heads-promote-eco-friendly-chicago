The 14 giant head planters on Chicago's lower Michigan Avenue are turning heads and hopefully changing mindsets. They're installed and decorated by  Plant Green Ideas , an organization promoting sustainability on both the individual and civic level. The six-and-a-half feet tall sculptures, crafted from recycled concrete, self-water their foliage hair-dos through rain storage. They also offer passers-by eco-friendly lifestyle tips such as "limit showers to six minutes," "ride a bike," and "give your kids soybean crayons" with tattoo like missives printed on the back of the neck. Interactive QR codes on the base provide more information for those who want to act on the green suggestions. "Plant Green Ideas" will be on display through August 31. Mini versions of the heads, which you can seed at home, are for sale at local area  Walgreens ; proceeds go to a good cause,  SGA Youth and Family Services . If you didn't know it, Chicago boasts the nation's largest urban solar plant and has more green rooftops than any other metropolis. Restaurants such as  Avec  and  Topolobampo  promote farm-to-table menus and eco-friendly linen washing, while O’Hare airport has launched the world’s first aeroponic urban garden, located in Terminal 3.
