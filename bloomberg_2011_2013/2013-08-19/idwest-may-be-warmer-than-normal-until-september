Temperatures in the Midwest probably
will linger above normal until the start of September, said Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The weather through that region and the northern Great
Plains may be 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 4.4 Celsius)
warmer than usual from Aug. 24 to Aug. 28, with the highest
readings in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota, he said.  Temperatures 3 degrees above normal are expected to Midwest
and Ohio Valley from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2, said Rogers, who’s
based in Bethesda,  Maryland . The U.S. Northeast is expected to
remain seasonal from Aug. 24 to Sept. 2.  Warmer temperatures may lead to increased energy
consumption as people seek air conditioning.  The normal average temperature in  New York  City on Aug. 28
is 75 degrees, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston it’s 70 degrees; in Chicago,
71; St. Louis, 78; Houston, 84;  Seattle , 65; and in Burbank,
California, 76.  To contact the reporter on this story:
