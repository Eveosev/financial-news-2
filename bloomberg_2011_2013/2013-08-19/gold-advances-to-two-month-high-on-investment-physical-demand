Gold declined from a two-month high
in  New York  amid concern that the  Federal Reserve  will slow the
pace of stimulus, crimping demand for the precious metal as a
store of value.  The central bank, which has kept  interest rates  at a
record-low since 2008, probably will reduce monetary stimulus of
$85 billion in monthly bond purchases in September after gains
in the economy, according to 65 percent of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. The minutes of the previous Federal Open Market
Committee meeting will be released on Aug. 21.  “The market is speculating that the Fed will announce the
beginning of the tapering,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “We are
seeing investors tread with more caution.”  Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,365.70 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, prices reached $1,384.10, the highest for a most-active contract since June 18.  Volume Drops  Trading on the Comex was 31 percent below the average for
the past 100 days for this time of day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold has tumbled 19 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value, wiping $56.1
billion from the value of bullion-backed exchange-traded
products. Lower prices spurred purchases of jewelry and coins,
helping the metal head for a second straight monthly gain.  The precious metal jumped 70 percent from the end of
December 2008 to June 2011 as the Fed bought more than $2
trillion in bonds to bolster the economy.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$23.215 an ounce, after touching $23.64, the highest since May
14. It advanced 15 percent last week, the most since September
2008.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery declined 1.2 percent to $1,509 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery slumped 1.3 percent to
$752.90 an ounce, the biggest drop since Aug. 6  To contact the reporter on this story:
