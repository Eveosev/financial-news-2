President  Barack Obama  met with
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other financial
regulators to urge quicker progress on implementing the Dodd-Frank law.  The closed-door meeting at the White House today also
included Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, the Comptroller of the
Currency, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, the acting director of the  Federal Housing Finance
Agency , and the chairmen of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., National Credit
Union Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.  The administration provided no details on the discussion.  Obama’s intent was to “convey to them the sense of urgency
that he feels” about getting all the Dodd-Frank rules fully in
place, deputy White House press secretary  Josh Earnest  said.
“There’s no doubt they have a tall order.”  A White House statement released after the meeting said
Obama also discussed the need for a simpler housing finance
system “that better serves middle-class families” and
cooperation among agencies involved in financial market
regulation.  The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law by Obama in July 2010,
expanded the central bank’s power to oversee the largest
financial institutions and gave regulators new tools aimed at
preventing a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. It
imposed new rules on derivatives, limits the ability of banks to
trade on their own account and new rules for mortgages.  To contact the reporters on this story:
