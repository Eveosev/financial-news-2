Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL) , the country’s
biggest mobile phone provider by subscribers, closed at a 15-month high as speculation competition is waning outweighed a
decline in the company’s second-quarter profit.  The  stock  climbed 3.3 percent to 41.55 shekels, the highest
level since May 2012, at the close in  Tel Aviv . The number of
shares traded was 1.1 times the company’s three-month daily
average.  Israel ’s benchmark TA-25 Index added 0.1 percent,
rising for a second day.  Cellcom’s average revenue per user increased 3.8 shekels in
the three months through June, compared with the previous
quarter, the first advance in three years, it said in a
statement today. The company is the second-best performer on the
TA-25  index (TA-25)  this year, with a gain of 35 percent, even as new
operators including Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. and Golan
Telecom Ltd. entered the market last year, when Cellcom dropped
52 percent.  “The results show some slowing in the competition that has
enabled the company to update the price of packages offered,”
Ori Licht, the head of research at I.B.I-Israel Brokerage &
Investments in Tel Aviv, said in an e-mailed note today. The
company reported a loss of 15,000 subscribers in the second
quarter, compared with 33,000 in the first three months, Licht
said.  Net income slumped 45 percent to 66 million shekels ($18.4
million) as revenue dropped 18 percent to 1.24 billion shekels,
Cellcom said in the statement.  “Although a significant slowdown can be seen in the scope
of net portability between the cellular companies, competition
is still strong and price erosion continues, although at a lower
level than before,” Nir Sztern, chief executive officer of
Cellcom, said in the statement.  Shares (CEL)  of  Partner Communications Co. (PTNR) , Israel’s second-largest mobile carrier, increased 2.1 percent to 29.15 shekels,
the highest level since March 2012. The shares have gained 30
percent this year.  Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. (BEZQ) , which
provides wireless services via its unit Pelephone Communications
Ltd., advanced 1.6 percent, bringing its year-to-date gain to 49
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
