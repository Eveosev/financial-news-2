European stocks  fell, following
three weeks of gains for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as this
week’s release of minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s last
meeting fueled speculation policy makers will trim bond buying.  Glencore Xstrata Plc dropped 2.1 percent, following mining
companies lower.  Holcim (HOLN)  Ltd. sank the most in 21 months after
UBS AG downgraded its rating on the world’s biggest cement
maker. Spanish and Italian banks led losses in European lenders
as UniCredit SpA and Banco Santander SA slid more than 2.5
percent. Kentz Corp. rallied 24 percent as the Irish oilfield-services provider rejected two takeover approaches.  The Stoxx 600 decreased 0.5 percent to 304.77 at the close
of trading as the  Federal Open Market Committee  prepared to
publish minutes of its July meeting on Wednesday. The equity
benchmark has  fallen 1.9 percent  from its peak this year on May
22 as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S.
central bank could pare stimulus measures if the economy
improves in line with forecasts.  “The FOMC minutes is this week’s large focus, and the
uncertainty surrounding the upcoming Fed tapering is causing
stocks to inch lower,” said Mark Andersen, who helps oversee
$1.7 trillion as head of  asset allocation  at UBS in Zurich.
“The main question we are debating at the moment is whether the
Fed taper is really in the price of equities. It’s fair to say
that market participants are a bit more nervous about the
prospect of Fed easing.”  VStoxx Gains  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 13 percent less than the average of the last 100 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The VStoxx Index, which
measures the cost of options hedging against moves in the Euro
Stoxx 50 Index, surged 6.6 percent for the biggest increase in
almost two months.  Investors will scrutinize minutes of the FOMC’s July 30-31
meeting for indications of when the Fed will begin to reduce the
$85 billion pace of monthly bond purchases. The minutes may also
describe the risks from inflation staying below the central
bank’s 2 percent goal. The FOMC holds its next two-day meeting
on Sept. 17-18.  Treasuries fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year
securities up as much as 5 basis points to 2.87 percent, the
highest since July 2011.  Central bankers and policy makers meet in  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming , from Aug. 22 to Aug. 24 to discuss the global economy
and monetary policy.  Glencore lost 2.1 percent to 301.95 pence after Reuters
reported the mining company created three months ago may write
down as much as $7 billion of inherited Xstrata assets when it
reports its  first-half earnings  tomorrow.  Mining Companies  A gauge of mining shares posted the second-worst
performance of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600, as the
price of copper fell as much as 1.5 percent in  London . Rio Tinto
Group and Anglo American Plc dropped 1.6 percent to 3,055 pence
and 3.6 percent to 1,492.5 pence, respectively.  Holcim sank 4.4 percent to 67.75 Swiss francs, the most
since November 2011. UBS cut its recommendation on the stock to
neutral, the equivalent of hold, from buy. The brokerage said
currency fluctuations will reduce earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization by 190 million francs ($205
million) in 2014.  A gauge of lenders contributed the most to the Stoxx 600’s
decline. Santander,  Spain ’s largest bank, retreated 2.9 percent
to 5.65 euros as the spread on 10-year Spanish bonds over German
securities widened four basis points to 252 basis points.
Bankinter SA slid 5.2 percent to 3.65 euros.  UniCredit Sinks  UniCredit fell 5.2 percent to 4.53 euros and Banco Popolare
SC lost 4.5 percent to 1.12 euros. The spread on benchmark 10-year Italian debt over bunds with the same maturity widened
eight basis points to 238 basis points.  Kentz jumped 24 percent to 591 pence, the biggest rally
since its initial public offering in February 2008, after
rejecting potential takeover approaches from companies including
Amec Plc and M&W Group GmbH. Amec said in a statement that
Kentz’s board of directors turned down its offer of 565 pence to
580 pence a share, saying it undervalued the company.  Kentz also rejected M&W’s possible offer, which it said was
lower than Amec’s.  Atlas Copco AB (ATCOA)  advanced 1.4 percent to 180 kronor. The
world’s largest maker of air compressors agreed to buy  Edwards
Group Ltd. (EVAC)  for $1.2 billion in cash to expand in vacuum pumps.
Shareholders of the British company will receive as much as
$10.50 a share depending on this year’s financial results,
Stockholm-based Atlas Copco said in a statement.  Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY)  added 1.6 percent to 249.7 pence after
Deutsche Bank AG raised its rating on Britain’s largest
construction company to buy from hold. The brokerage said that
first-half results may have marked a trough in earnings.  National benchmark indexes retreated in 15 of the 18
western European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 slipped 1
percent and  Germany ’s DAX fell 0.3 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
declined 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
