Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , a Japanese trading
company, acquired 50 percent stakes in two solar power stations
in  France  from EDF Energies Nouvelles SA.  The projects which have a combined capacity of 56 megawatts
were acquired through Mitsubishi’s wholly owned subsidiary,
Diamond Generating  Europe , the company said in a statement
today. No financial terms were disclosed.  The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier today that the
purchases will cost about 2 billion yen ($20 million). The paper
didn’t say where it got the information.  Mitsubishi had earlier acquired a 50 percent stake in the
Toul Rosieres solar power plant in France, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
