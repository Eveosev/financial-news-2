German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
canceled an election rally in the Bavarian city of Ingolstadt
after an armed man took several hostages in the town hall.  Merkel and Bavarian Prime Minister  Horst Seehofer , who had
been due to speak in the home town of carmaker Audi at 5 p.m.,
canceled their appearance because of the hostage situation, the
 Christian Democratic Union  and its CSU sister party said by e-mail today.  The man entered the building at about 9 a.m and is holding
an unspecified number of people, police spokesman Guenther Beck
said by phone. The perpetrator has as yet made no demands, he
said. Merkel, running for a third term in Sept. 22 elections,
was due to hold rallies in Ingolstadt and nearby Regensburg
before traveling to Erlangen and Dachau tomorrow.  The perpetrator is a 23-year-old man, convicted of stalking
a town hall employee who had ended a friendship with him, local
newspaper  Donaukurier  reported. The man has been treated in a
psychiatric clinic close to the town hall, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
