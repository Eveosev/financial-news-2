Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) ’s new
chief will face the dual challenges of finding customers for
premium seats as  China ’s economic growth cools and budget
airline flights start from its home turf.  Ivan Chu, 51, was last week named as the next  chief
executive  of Cathay, and will take over after annual results are
announced in March. Chu has worked at Cathay for 29 years and
has been chief operating officer since March 2011. His strategy
will determine whether the airline will retain its dominant 50
percent share of passengers flying out of the former British
colony.  China’s expansion slowed for a second straight quarter to
7.5 percent in the three months ended June, extending the
longest streak of expansion below 8 percent in at least two
decades. That is critical for the prospects of Hong Kong’s
marquee airline because of the city’s stature as a financial and
trade hub for the world’s second-largest economy.  “It’s becoming increasingly difficult to fill premium-class seats, not just because of job cuts in Wall Street, but
also because of economic slowdown in China,” said Shin Ji Yoon,
an analyst at KTB Securities Co. in  Seoul . “Fewer people are
flying from the U.S. to China these days and that hurts
financial hubs like Hong Kong.”  Chu will take over from John Slosar, who will become
chairman, the Hong Kong-based airline said in a  statement  Aug.
16.  Swire Pacific Ltd. (19) , the carrier’s biggest shareholder, said
separately that Slosar, 57, will also become its chairman.  Brushstroke Tail  The airline’s  shares  rose 0.3 percent to HK$14.28 in Hong
Kong trading today. Shares of Cathay, with a market
capitalization of  HK$56 billion  ($7.2 billion), have risen 0.4
percent this year.  The appointment comes after Cathay last week reported
first-half profit that was the lowest in at least 15 years. The
earnings missed analyst  estimates  as cargo revenue dropped and
declining yields in North Asia offset gains from carrying more
passengers.  China has set a 2013 expansion target of 7.5 percent after
gross domestic product rose 7.8 percent last year, the least
since 1999. The country’s potential growth rate has fallen to a
range of 7 percent to 8 percent, the State Council Information
Office has said.  Cathay -- with its “ brushstroke ” image in a white and
green tail -- in June won the award for the best flight crew
from  Skytrax . The airline was also within the top 10 for premium
seats, according to Skytrax’s website.  Hong Kong’s Budget Airline  Filling premium seats will become more challenging as
companies such as  Wall Street  firms cut back.  The number of people employed in  New York  City in
“securities and commodities contracts intermediation and
brokerage,” which includes investment banking and securities
dealing, fell to about 101,200 in March, a decline of more than
30 percent from the peak in December 2000 and the fewest in
Bureau of Labor records dating to 1990.  Slosar, who took over in March 2011, cut capacity and
phased out planes to revive  earnings .  “They’ve demonstrated shrinking is the way to
profitability, yet they want to grow in the long term,” said
Will Horton, an analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. “Even if
markets rebound, the traffic isn’t necessarily for Cathay’s
taking.”  The airline should also brace for competition from a Hong
Kong-based budget carrier. In June,  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN)  and
 China Eastern Airlines (670)  Corp.’s planned venture to be based in
the city sold a stake to a company founded by Stanley Ho and
held by his family. That may help pave the way for an operating
license for the budget airline Jetstar Hong Kong.  Gambling Billionaire  Jetstar Hong Kong aims to have its first flights by the end
of this year, China Eastern Vice Chairman Ma Xulun said in March.
Also, Hong Kong Express, an affiliate of  Hong Kong Airlines (1055) ,
will convert to a low-cost model later this year, Executive Vice
President Sun Jianfeng said in June.  No budget carrier has a hub at Hong Kong Airport, an
opportunity that lured gambling billionaire  Stanley Ho ’s group.  “He’s got his job cut out for him,” said K. Ajith,
Singapore-based aviation analyst at UOB Kay Hian Research.
“There’s competition coming from low-cost carriers and
declining demand for premium cabins. The setting up of a low-fare carrier in Hong Kong is a threat for Cathay.”  Oasis Hong Kong Airlines Ltd., which operated budget long-haul flights, collapsed in 2008 after racking up losses of about
HK$1 billion in less than two years.  Continuity  Chu will also need to fix Cathay’s cargo business, where
revenue fell 5.2 percent in the first half of the year.  “I had thought Slosar would have had a longer time in the
pilot seat,” said Timothy Ross, Singapore-based transportation
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. “At some point, the  carrier 
was likely to have had an executive of Chinese ethnic origin to
run the company.”  American Roy C. Farrell and Australian Sydney H. de Kantzow
founded Cathay Pacific Airways on 24 September, 1946, according
to the airline’s website. Initially based in  Shanghai , the two
men eventually moved to  Hong Kong  and established the airline.  Chu joined Cathay in 1984 and has worked with the group in
Hong Kong, mainland China,  Taiwan ,  Thailand  and  Australia .
Before he became COO, he was director for service delivery. The
post of COO has been a stepping stone for the top job at the
airline for the last three incumbents.  “There’s some continuity,” said Andrew Orchard, an
analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong. “At least,
there seems to be some succession structure that the company is
following. That could only be a good thing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
