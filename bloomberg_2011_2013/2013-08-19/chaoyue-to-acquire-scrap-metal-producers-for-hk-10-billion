Chaoyue Group Ltd. (147)  agreed to buy two
Chinese makers of stainless steel and copper products for HK$10
billion ($1.3 billion) after selling its main water purification
businesses.  Chaoyue will pay Chung Ming Metal Resources Holdings Ltd.
HK$3 billion in cash for the acquisition, it said today in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The rest of the
payment will be in shares and convertible bonds, it said.  “The group has been focusing on finding suitable
investments that present development opportunities and also able
to provide a sustainable stream of cash flow and profit in the
long run,” Chaoyue said.  Chaoyue is seeking to tap into the recycled metal market in
 China  after selling its water purification equipment and most of
its stake in a mining operation last year. The assets will make
Chaoyue one of the 10 biggest scrap-based stainless steel
producers and one of the five largest scrap-based copper makers
in China, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
