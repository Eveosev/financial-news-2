Tunisia’s grain harvest slid 47
percent this year after dry weather prompted farmers to reduce
planting, the United Nations said.  The crop fell to 1.37 million metric tons from 2.61 million
tons a year earlier, the UN’s Rome-based Food & Agriculture
Organization said in a country  report  posted online today. The
total includes 1.02 million tons of wheat and 320,000 tons of
barley, as well as other grains. The harvest finished in June
and July.  “Insufficient rain during the planting season in late 2012
resulted in decreased wheat and barley planted area,” the FAO
said. “A below-average cereal crop was gathered despite the
well-distributed rains from mid-January to end of March. In
Tunisia, crop production varies markedly from year to year
depending on the significant rainfall variations.”  Tunisia’s grain imports may jump to 3.57 million tons in
the 2013-14 marketing year that began July 1, about 30 percent
more than the prior period and 23 percent higher than the five-year average, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
