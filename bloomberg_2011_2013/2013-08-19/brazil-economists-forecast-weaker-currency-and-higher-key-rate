Brazil  economists forecast a weaker
real than predicted last week, in a move that will fuel
inflation and force the central bank to further raise  interest
rates .  The real will weaken to 2.35 per  U.S. dollar  by the end of
2014 from 2.30 in December 2013, according to the Aug. 16
central bank survey of about 100 analysts published today. They
previously saw the real at 2.28 in December and 2.30 a year
later. Economists also raised their 2014 key rate forecast to
9.50 percent from 9.25 percent.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is working to
accelerate economic growth while controlling inflation in the
world’s second-largest emerging market. Officials this year have
cut tariffs on more than 100 goods and have expanded subsidized
credit for home appliances to stimulate activity. At the same
time, policy makers have signaled they may extend the biggest
key rate increases in the world to prevent higher prices from
slowing consumption and investments.  The real, which dropped to the weakest in 4 1/2 years
today, is complicating the government’s effort to control
inflation. Brazil’s currency fell 15.7 percent in the past three
months to 2.4122, the worst performance against the dollar among
24  emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015, the most
traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, to 10.54 percent at 9:06 local time.  Faster Inflation  While prices as measured by the IPCA index rose 0.03
percent in July from the month prior, the slowest increase in
three years, monthly inflation will likely accelerate, central
bank director for economic policy, Carlos Hamilton, said Aug.
12. Annual inflation  in July  slowed to 6.27 percent after
surpassing the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central bank’s
target range in March and June.  Inflation prompted policy makers to raise the Selic by 50
basis points to 8.50 percent in July after increases of 50 basis
points and 25 basis points in May and April. The central bank
board at its Aug. 27-28 meeting will raise borrowing costs by at
least an additional 50 basis points, swaps show.  Economists raised their 12-month inflation forecast to 5.97
percent from 5.95 percent a week earlier, according to the
central bank’s survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
