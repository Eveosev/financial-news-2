President  Francois Hollande  wants to
go further in overhauling the  French economy , Prime Minister
Jean-Marc Ayrault said, adding the government will decide
changes to the retirement system within weeks.  Hollande asked his cabinet ministers today to present their
plans to shape  France  between now and 2025, prompting  talk in
the cabinet  of full employment, less crowded prisons and a new
immigration system.  “We’ve shown France can reform itself but we want to go
further,” Ayrault said today after the meeting. “This is not a
theoretical exercise. Ten years isn’t far off. If we don’t set
objectives in advance, we won’t get anywhere.”  Hollande must sketch out his visions at a time when
 unemployment  is at a 14-year high of almost 11 percent and
economic growth will be close to zero for a second calendar
year, according to government forecasts. He says he wants within
the coming month to set out plans to close a 20 billion-euro
shortfall in the pension system and narrow the  budget deficit ,
following a revamp of labor rules and a payroll tax cut this
year.  The president’s pledge to change the pay-as-you-go pension
system is the latest test of his ability to satisfy his
Socialist base while fulfilling his goal of closing France’s
budget deficit and making the country more competitive. He’s
said people probably will have to work longer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
