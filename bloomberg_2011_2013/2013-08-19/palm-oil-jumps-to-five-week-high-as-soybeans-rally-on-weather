Palm oil climbed to a five-week high
as soybeans rallied on concern that dry weather in the U.S. may
hurt crops in the largest grower of the oilseed crushed to make
an alternative oil.  The contract for November delivery gained as much as 1.3
percent to 2,340 ringgit ($713) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest level for the most-active
contract since July 12, and ended the morning session at 2,338
ringgit. Palm for physical delivery in September was at 2,380
ringgit on Aug. 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Soybeans in  Chicago  extended the best weekly advance in
more than a year as the U.S. government cut its forecast for the
2013 harvest after excessive rains in May and June reduced
planted acreage and damaged yields. Dry weather is expected to
continue across the west-central Midwest for the next 10 days
and moisture shortages and stress will build for soybeans and
corn, MDA Information Systems LLC said in an Aug. 16 report.  “The current weather conditions in the U.S., which is
driving soybean oil prices up, will have a positive spillover
effect on palm oil prices because soybean oil is a close
substitute to palm oil,” said Sim Han Qiang, an analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte. in  Singapore . “When soybean oil prices
increase, it tends to put buying pressure on crude palm oil.”  Soybean oil’s  premium  over palm oil gained to $253.24 a ton
today from $245.82 on Aug. 16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Soybean oil for delivery in December rose 1.3 percent
to 43.73 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans
for November advanced 2 percent to $12.8425 a bushel. The most
active contract advanced 6.5 percent last week, the steepest
gain since the five days ended July 20, 2012.  Refined palm oil for January delivery advanced 0.6 percent
to 5,644 yuan ($923) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil prices increased 0.8 percent to 7,244  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
