England  added batsman Michael
Carberry to the squad that will face  Australia  in their two-match Twenty20 International cricket series.  The 32-year-old is the only member of the squad who hasnâ€™t
played for England in a Twenty20 match. He averaged 56 runs for
Hampshire in its Twenty20 competition, the England and Wales
Cricket Board said today in an e-mailed statement.  The teams will play Aug. 29 in Hampshire and two days later
in Durham. The final match in the five-Test Ashes series with
Australia, which England is leading 3-0, will start in two days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
