Foreign ministers from the European
Union’s 28 member nations will meet on Aug. 21 to discuss
relations with  Egypt , the EU said, after the bloc warned
yesterday that an escalation of violence in the country could
have “unpredictable consequences.”  The EU will “urgently review” its relations with Egypt
with the goal of promoting an end to violence and the resumption
of political dialogue in the country, EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  and European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said in a
joint statement yesterday. “Further escalation must be
prevented,” they said.  More than 900 people have died in turmoil that has gripped
Egypt in the past week after the government moved to crush
Islamist protests. Militants attacked two police vehicles in
northern Sinai early today, killing 25 officers. Defense
Minister Abdelfatah al-Seesi, who led the ouster of Islamist
President Mohamed Mursi last month, warned yesterday that the
military won’t tolerate additional violence.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
