Bovis Homes Plc. (BVS)  said it expects the
price of its homes to increase by 10 percent this year, lifting
its profit margin as land bought at a discount lowers
development costs.  The Kent, England-based homebuilder has planning approval
for about 12,000 homes across about 80 sites acquired since the
housing downturn in 2008, it said in a statement today. Both
greater volume and higher prices will boost full-year revenue
and return on investment, it said.  Rising sales “on new, more profitable sites, will enable
the group to increase profits significantly in 2013 in line with
its expectations, subject to stable market conditions,” Chief
Executive David Ritchie said in the statement. The company’s
return on capital employed may rise “in the foreseeable
future” to 15 percent to 18 percent from 10 percent.  Home buyers have easier access to mortgages and “appear
more confident about buying a home” after the U.K. government
introduced a program to boost home ownership to help revive the
economy, Bovis said. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
is offering homebuyers an equity loan of as much as 20 percent
of the value of newly built home valued at 600,000 pounds
($940,000) or less as part of the program.  Bovis fell 1.7 percent in London trading to close at 765
pence. The stock has risen 33 percent this year giving the
company a market value to 1.03 billion pounds.  The rate of sales at Bovis sites rose 28 percent in the
first half compared with the same period in 2012, the
homebuilder said. Net income increased to 14.4 million pounds,
or 10.8 pence a share, from a restated 11.5 million pounds, or
8.6 pence, a year earlier. The dividend for the period was
increased to 4 pence from 3 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
