At least 35 people, most of them
Hindu pilgrims, died after being hit by a speeding express train
as they crossed tracks in  India ’s Bihar state.  The victims were alighting from a local service at Dhamara
Ghat Station in the province’s  Khagaria  district at around 8:40
a.m. local time. The driver of the express was beaten by local
people and coaches of the train were set ablaze, S.K. Bhardwaj,
additional director general of police in Bihar, said by phone.
Many others were injured, he said.  Police reinforcements were deployed to contain anger over
the incident, said Bhardwaj. The express was passing through the
station, which was not a scheduled stop, railways spokesman Anil
Saxena told reporters in  New Delhi .  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  expressed shock over the loss
of life and directed the railways ministry to ensure all
available resources for rescue and relief operations. He
appealed for calm so that rescue work could be carried out.  India’s 65,000-kilometer (40,389-mile) network,  Asia ’s
oldest, carries about 23 million people every day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
