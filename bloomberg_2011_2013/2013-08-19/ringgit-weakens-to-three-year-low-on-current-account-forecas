Malaysia’s ringgit touched a three-year low before official data this week that economists predict
will show a narrower current-account surplus and faster
inflation.  Government bonds  advanced.  The excess in the broadest measure of trade shrank to 200
million ringgit ($61 million) in the second quarter from 8.7
billion ringgit in the previous three months, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due Aug. 21.
 Consumer prices  rose 2 percent in July from a year earlier, the
most since March 2012, a separate poll showed ahead of figures
to be released the same day.  “Investors are looking ahead to an important week for
Malaysian data,” said Nick Verdi, a Singapore-based currency
strategist at Barclays Plc. “We think the market’s probably
been a bit too pessimistic on the current account and that could
be driving sentiment a little.”  The ringgit was little changed at 3.2773 per dollar as of
9:41 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  after touching 3.2840 earlier, the
weakest level since June 11, 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has lost 3.7 percent this quarter, the third-worst
performance among  Asia ’s 11 most-traded currencies. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, dropped 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 8.24 percent.  Gross domestic product increased 4.8 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, after rising 4.1 percent in the
January through March period, according to the median estimate
of economists in another Bloomberg survey ahead of central bank
data due Aug. 21.  The  Federal Reserve  will release the minutes of its July
meeting on Aug. 21, which may yield clues on when it will start
cutting stimulus that has spurred inflows to  emerging markets .  The yield on the 3.48 percent bonds due March 2023 fell one
basis point to 3.88 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
