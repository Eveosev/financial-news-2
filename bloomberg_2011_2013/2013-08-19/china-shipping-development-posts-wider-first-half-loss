China Shipping Development Co. (1138) , the
commodities-carrying unit of China’s No. 2 shipping company,
posted a wider first-half loss as a global oversupply of vessels
weighed on freight rates.  The net loss was 923 million yuan ($151 million), compared
with 492 million yuan a year earlier, under the International
Financial Reporting Standards, the company said in a filing to
the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  today.  China Shipping Development last year sought to delay
deliveries of new vessels and scrap more ships as a slump in
freight charges pushed the company into its first half-year loss
since at least 1998. The company said it expects a net loss for
the nine months through September for the group.  “The shipping market is expected to remain difficult in
the second half of this year,” the company said in its
statement. “In bulk shipping, the growth in global shipping
volume is rather small, while the capacity keeps rising, though
at a slower pace.”  Shares of China Shipping Development, a unit of China
Shipping Group Co., rose 0.3 percent to HK$4 in  Hong Kong 
trading today before the earnings were released. Its Shanghai
shares gained 0.6 percent.  The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , the benchmark for hauling
commodities, averaged 920 points last year, the lowest since
1986.  To contact the reporter on this story:
