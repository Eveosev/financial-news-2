Bang & Olufsen A/S (BO)  fell to its
lowest price in more than two weeks in Copenhagen trading as
Nordea Markets said the Danish luxury stereo and television set
maker is too dependent on revenue from a toughening TV market.  B&O fell as much as 2.7 percent to 54.50 kroner, its lowest
since Aug. 2. The stock declined to 55.50 kroner at 9:45 a.m.,
with volume at 36 percent of the three-month daily average.  B&O reported Aug. 16 a fourth-quarter net loss, the third
loss in the past four quarters, as revenue plunged 15 percent.
While the Struer, Denmark-based company has introduced new
products that may boost growth, TV sales are “a key risk” for
the stock amid toughening competition, Nordea said today. The
bank repeated a sell recommendation.  “Selling prices are likely to come down further, and we
are unsure if volume growth will be able to compensate for
this,” Dan Kirk Wejse, a Copenhagen-based analyst with Nordea,
said in a note. “Consequently, we expect AV revenue to decline
further in the coming years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
