German economic growth returned to
its potential in the second quarter, according to the
Bundesbank.  “The high growth rate in the quarter has to be seen in
connection with the stagnation in the first quarter,” the
Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly report today.
“The significantly increased economic activity in the spring
means that the German economy has returned to its normal
utilization.”  Gross domestic product  in  Germany , the euro area’s biggest
economy, grew more than expected in the three months through
June, climbing 0.7 percent after it stagnated in the first
quarter and shrank 0.5 percent in the final three months of last
year. The 17-nation euro region, Germany’s biggest trading
partner,  emerged  from its longest-ever recession in the second
quarter and the  European Central Bank  predicts a further
recovery in the second half of 2013.  In Germany, economic growth is expected to “normalize and
stabilize” in the remainder of the year, the Bundesbank said
today.  In June, it lowered its growth projection to 0.3 percent
from 0.4 percent for this year, and cut its 2014 outlook to 1.5
percent from 1.9 percent. That compares with the ECB projecting
the euro-area economy to shrink 0.6 percent in 2013 before
growing 1.1 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
