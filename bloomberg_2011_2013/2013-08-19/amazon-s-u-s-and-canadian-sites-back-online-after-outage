Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s U.S. and Canadian
Web stores are back online again after a 30-minute outage, which
was detected by individual users and sites that track Web page
availability.  Amazon’s stores in some countries went offline starting
around 3 p.m.  New York  time, according to  Isitdownrightnow.com ,
which pings websites to identify response times and provides a
forum for users. More than 70 users commented on Amazon’s Web
outage while it was down, describing access to Amazon.com and
Amazon.ca, the retailer’s Canadian store.  Amazon’s  health dashboard  of its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing business also indicated increased error rates in some
areas. A tool called  AWS Management Console  showed disruptions
beginning from 3:14 p.m. Seattle-based Amazon is the world’s
largest online retailer and depended on its website for $61.1
billion in sales last year.  Shares in Amazon rose less than 1 percent to $285.57 at the
close in New York, leaving them up 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
