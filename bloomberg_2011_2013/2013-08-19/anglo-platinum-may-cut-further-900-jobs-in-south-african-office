Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the
biggest producer of the metal, may cut 900 jobs from its head
office on top of 6,000 already planned at its South African
mines as the company seeks to revive profitability.  Amplats, as the company is known, finished talks with labor
unions on reducing staff, idling shafts and shrinking annual
output by 350,000 ounces, the Johannesburg-based company said
today in a statement. The number of workers affected will depend
on measures to ease cuts such as voluntary severance packages,
early retirement and moving employees to other positions.  Platinum producers in South Africa, the country with the
largest known reserves, are seeking to curb costs after strikes
last year led to above-inflation wage gains and prices dropped.
“A month’s notice period for affected employees will commence
on Sept. 1,” Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith said.  Amplats agreed with unions to cut no more than 4,138 jobs,
Alwyn van Heerden, head of platinum at the UASA union, said on
Friday. Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union
President Joseph Mathunjwa declined to comment on Amplats’
decision. The AMCU is the majority union at the group.  “I find it shocking,”  Lesiba Seshoka , a spokesman for the
National Union of Mineworkers, said by mobile phone. “What
they’re saying is not according to the agreement” for about
3,000 job cuts, mostly voluntary and redeployment, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
