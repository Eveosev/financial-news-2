GTx Inc. (GTXI) , a drugmaker that recorded
no  revenue  last year, plunged the most ever after the company
said an experimental treatment failed to meet its goals in
studies to combat muscle-wasting in lung-cancer patients.  GTx fell 64 percent to $1.48 at 10:02 a.m. New York time,
after losing as much as 68 percent for its biggest intraday
decline since an initial public offering in 2004. The Memphis,
Tennessee-based company said today that its drug candidate,
enobosarm, fell short of targets in two clinical trials.  The drugmaker said it plans to contact U.S. and European
regulators to discuss “the path forward” for enobosarm. While
failing to meet its primary goals in the studies, the drug did
have an impact on lean-body mass compared with patients who
received a placebo, GTx said in a statement.  “We are encouraged by the unambiguous effect of enobosarm
on muscle and we are confident that it will translate to
clinical benefit and potentially increase survival in patients
with non-small cell lung cancer,” said Mitchell Steiner, the
company’s chief executive officer.  GTx shares had fallen 1.2 percent for the year through the
end of last week’s  trading .  To contact the reporter on this story:
