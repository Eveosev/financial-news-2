Syria ’s main political opposition
group called on United Nations inspectors to probe claims of
chemical weapons use in areas controlled by rebels fighting
troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.  The inspectors, led by Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake
Sellstrom, arrived in Damascus yesterday after Syria invited
them to investigate allegations about the use of chemical
weapons in the conflict that began in March 2011.  A statement from the opposition Syrian National Coalition
said only visiting sites under government control “won’t be
enough” because it won’t allow the inspectors to reach “sound,
real and conclusive” results.  The opposition and the government have traded accusations
over chemical weapons use during the conflict that has killed at
least 100,000 people, according to UN estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
