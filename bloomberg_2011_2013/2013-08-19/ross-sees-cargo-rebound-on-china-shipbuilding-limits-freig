Wilbur Ross , the billionaire
investor in struggling industries, says Chinese limits on
shipbuilding will help the cargo market overcome the excess of
carriers that led to the worst slump on record.  The  China  Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry
said last month about 30 percent of the country’s shipyards will
close in five years and the government enacted a three-year plan
to limit capacity Aug. 4. Ross, part of an investment group that
spent $900 million on fuel tankers in 2011, said China will
avoid a repeat of its most recent construction program, the
biggest by one nation in history.  The boom sent ship earnings to at least a 23-year low.
Investors are becoming more bullish because construction has
slumped 61 percent from its 2009 peak and demolition of obsolete
vessels is near a record. Shares of Monaco-based  Scorpio Tankers (STNG) 
Inc. rose 37 percent this year and will climb another 17 percent
in 12 months, while  Frontline 2012 Ltd. (FRNT)  will advance 43 percent,
analyst estimates show.  “The combination of reducing order books and increased
scrappage will result in a better balance between supply and
demand by late 2014 or early 2015 in most segments,” Ross, the
founder of WL Ross & Co., said in an Aug. 13 e-mail. “I’m less
worried than I was.”  Lowest Rates  The ClarkSea Index, a measure of earnings for vessels
across the merchant fleet, averaged $9,053 a day this year, the
lowest annual figure since at least 1990, according to Clarkson
Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker. The index peaked at $50,702
at the end of 2007, triggering record fleet expansion just
before the global recession.  Ross’s group bought a fleet of 30 oil-product tankers two
years ago. His company also has a majority stake in  Navigator
Holdings Ltd. (NVIGF) , which controls one-third of the world’s mid-size
carriers of liquefied petroleum gas. The New York-based
investor, whose holdings range from  steel mills  to U.K.
mortgages, said demand growth will be strongest in areas related
to U.S. energy supplies and he’s considering expanding his
investments in shipping.  Scorpio and Frontline 2012 have the largest orders for new
vessels, building tankers to export energy from the U.S.,
according to Frode Moerkedal, an analyst at RS Platou Markets
AS, the Oslo-based investment bank that’s part of the same
company as  Norway ’s biggest shipbroker.  Tripling Profit  Shares of Scorpio, which operates 45 oil-product tankers
and has orders for 60 more vessels, rose to $9.71 in  New York  in
2013 and will reach $11.34 in a year, according to the average
of 12 analyst estimates. The company’s net income will almost
triple to $81.2 million in 2014, the mean of 12 forecasts shows.  Frontline 2012 gained 52 percent to 41 kroner ($6.93) in
Oslo this year and will advance to 58.78 kroner in 12 months,
according to the average of seven analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Profit will jump more than fourfold this year to $6.4
million and to $29.3 million in 2014, the estimates show. It had
58 ships on order as of May.  Shipbuilding was among industries including iron and steel,
cement, electrolytic aluminum and flat glass that need to phase
out capacity, China’s Ministry of Industry and  Information
Technology  said in July.  Yards Closing  The combined profits of 80 major builders monitored by the
country’s shipbuilding association fell 54 percent in the first
half of the year to 3.58 billion  yuan  ($584 million),  China
Daily  reported July 24.  Chinese companies built 300.4 million deadweight tons of
ships since 2007, more than any other nation, according to
London-based Clarkson.  South Korea  supplied 282.5 million
deadweight tons over the same period.  The government may not be able to prevent yards from
accepting more orders as vessel prices rise, said Urs Dur, a New
York-based managing director of Clarkson Capital Markets, the
shipbroker’s investment-banking unit. Orders this year are
already 10 percent more than in all of 2012, Clarkson data show.  The cost of a new Capesize, the largest type of  iron-ore 
carrier, built in China rose 12 percent to $47 million in the
first half, according to data from Simpson, Spence & Young Ltd.,
the second-largest shipbroker. The 9.3 percent increase in May
was the largest since 2003, its figures show.  World Trade  While growth in China will slow to 7.5 percent this year,
the weakest since 1990, the median estimate of 57 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg showed, the nation’s economy is still
expanding fast enough to generate record cargoes of everything
from iron ore to coal and soybeans. The country’s rate of growth
will still be almost four times the global average.  World trade will expand 3.1 percent this year and rise
until at least 2018, the  International Monetary Fund  predicts.
The shipping industry carries 90 percent of global trade,
according to the Round Table of International Shipping
Associations.  Fleet growth will slow for a third consecutive year,
Clarkson estimates. The rate of expansion will fall to 4.9
percent in 2013 and 4.2 percent next year, the lowest since at
least 2004, its figures show.  Demolitions are also diminishing the glut, Ross said.
Owners scrapped a record 58.3 million deadweight tons last year
and will break up another 47.6 million tons in 2013, the second-highest for data starting in 2004, according to Clarkson.  Container Ships  Ross said in a June 20 interview on Bloomberg TV’s “The
Pulse” with Anna Edwards he was concerned Chinese shipbuilders
would prolong the glut of container ships and dry-bulk carriers.
The country wants to preserve jobs in the industry and make its
exports competitive by keeping transportation costs low, he said
at the time.  “A fear for investors is that China would support their
yards by building a lot of ships,” said Moerkedal of Platou,
whose recommendations on the shares of shipping companies
returned 16 percent in the past year. “If that’s not going to
be the case, then it’s a positive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
