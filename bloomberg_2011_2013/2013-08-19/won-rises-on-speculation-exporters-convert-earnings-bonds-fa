South Korea ’s government bonds fell,
pushing the three-year yield to the highest in six weeks, on
concern the  Federal Reserve  will begin reducing stimulus next
month. The won declined.  The Fed’s Open Market Committee will release minutes of its
July meeting this week, possibly giving an indication of when it
may cut its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. South Korea
sold 1.8 trillion won ($1.6 billion) of 10-year government notes
today at a yield of 3.75 percent with a bid-to-cover ratio of
3.63 times, the lowest since January 2011.  “Foreign demand is low, especially in long-term bonds, as
the Fed tapering prospects are gaining weight, whether it starts
in September or later this year,” said Kim Young Jung, a fixed-income analyst at Woori Futures Co. in  Seoul . “Investors will
be cautious until the FOMC minutes give a clue about the exit
timeline.”  The yield on the 2.75 percent sovereign bonds due June 2016
rose one basis point to 2.99 percent, the highest level since

Securities Co. economists Stephen Lee and James Huh said in an
Aug. 16 research note, citing Fed-tapering concerns. The
nation’s gross domestic product will grow 2.3 percent this year,
according to the note, which cited a slowing economy in  China ,

were little changed or fell for 14 straight months through July,
according to Kookmin Bank, the nation’s largest mortgage lender.  The won’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
climbed 44 basis points, or 0.44 percentage point, to 7.27
