Bluescope Steel Ltd. (BSL) ,  Australia ’s
largest steelmaker, fell the most in more than 18 months in
Sydney trading after forecasting profit this half isn’t expected
to beat the preceding six months.  The Melbourne-based producer fell 12 percent to A$4.80 at
10:45 a.m. local time, the most since Nov. 24, 2011. Australia’s
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was little changed.  Bluescope reported today in a statement that its net loss
for fiscal 2013 narrowed to A$84.1 million ($77.26 million),
from a loss of A$1 billion a year earlier, when it took one-time
charges for the restructuring of its Australian business. While
the company expected to book a profit this half, it cited
uncertainty in domestic demand for forecasting lower earnings
than last half.  “That one off-the-cuff line” is not instilling confidence
in the market, said Evan Lucas, a Melbourne-based market
strategist at IG Markets Ltd.  Margins may improve if the Australian dollar continues to
drop, the company said. The local dollar has declined 12 percent
this year, the most among the Group of 10 major developed-market
currencies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A change of
one U.S. cent in the value of the Australian dollar has an
impact on earnings before interest and tax of as much as A$2
million, the company said today in a presentation to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
