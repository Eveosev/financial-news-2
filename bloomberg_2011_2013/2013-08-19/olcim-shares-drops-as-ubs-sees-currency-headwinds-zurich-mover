(Corrects Indonesian currency in fourth paragraph.)  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s largest
maker of cement, fell the most in a month after  UBS AG (UBSN)  said
foreign-exchange headwinds will eat into 2014 profit margins.  Shares declined as much as much as 3 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since July 16 in Zurich, and traded 2.9 percent
lower as of 12:45 a.m., giving the Jona, Switzerland-based
company a market capitalization of 22.5 billion Swiss francs
($24.3 billion).  Currency fluctuations will cut Holcim’s earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by about 190
million francs in 2014, UBS analyst Gregor Kuglitsch wrote in a
note to investors today. Kuglitsch reduced his rating from buy
to neutral.  The Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah have depreciated
about 12 percent and 8 percent respectively against the franc
this year. Asia-Pacific, Holcim’s largest region by sales,
contributed 40 percent to 2012 sales and 44 percent to Ebitda.  The Swiss cement maker reported second quarter earnings of
5.3 billion francs on Aug. 15, short of the 5.5 billion-franc
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey, as sales from  India  to
 Mexico  missed expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
