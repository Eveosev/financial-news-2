Denver Broncos linebacker  Von Miller 
violated the league’s drug policy and will probably be suspended
six games,  ESPN reported .  Miller, at 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds, is the first player in
Broncos’ history to be named to the  Pro Bowl  in each of his
first two NFL seasons.  He was runner-up for the NFL Defensive Player of the Year
award last season with 18.5 quarterback sacks, 27 quarterback
knockdowns, 12 quarterback hurries and 28 tackles for a loss.  National Football League spokesman  Brian McCarthy  said in
an e-mail that the league “did not have anything to report” on
the case. Broncos spokesman Patrick Smyth didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ESPN story.  The  Denver Post  reported in July that Miller had multiple
positive tests for marijuana and an undisclosed amphetamine his
rookie season in 2011. That month, NFL Players Association
spokesman George Atallah announced in a twitter posting that
Miller’s case didn’t involve steroids, the Post reported.  Miller, 24, who is scheduled to receive $2.28 million in
salary this season, probably won’t appeal the suspension, ESPN
said. The length of the suspension is still being discussed and
a deal could be announced as early as today, the network said.  The Broncos’ linebacker met with the players union on Aug.
15 to try to have the punishment reduced to four games, though
that is unlikely, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
