New Zealand ’s  All Blacks  began
training in Wellington today as the prospect of more earthquakes
in the capital city set the backdrop for this weekend’s rugby
Test against  Australia .  All Blacks assistant coach Ian Foster said a magnitude 6.6
quake in Wellington on Aug. 16 had revived memories among the
New Zealand players of the devastating temblors that struck
Christchurch 2 1/2 years ago, the worst of which killed 185
people. The match on Aug. 24 is at Westpac Stadium, which was
closed today for inspections after last week’s quake.  “Certainly it’s on our mind, but no more so than anyone
else in this city,” Foster told reporters at the team hotel
before training today. “Apart from the safety issues, we’re
preparing for business as normal.”  While the Aug. 16 earthquake didn’t cause any injuries or
major damage in Wellington, it closed the country’s stock
exchange and prompted building evacuations. It was the third
major quake to strike the city in a month. Seismologists at GNS
Science say there’s a 90 percent chance of another magnitude 5
or greater occurring in the next seven days.  “It doesn’t affect me too much mate,” said All Blacks
loose forward Kieran Read, who’s based in earthquake-shattered
Christchurch. “We’re used to them. If it happens, it happens.”  The All Blacks defeated the Wallabies 47-29 in Sydney on
Aug. 17 as the Rugby Championship, which also includes  South
Africa  and  Argentina , got under way.  To contact the reporter on this story:
