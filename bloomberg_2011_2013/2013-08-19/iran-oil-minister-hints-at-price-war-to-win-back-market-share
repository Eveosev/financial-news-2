Iran ’s new oil minister, Bijan Namdar-Zanganeh, has released plans to raise oil production 70
percent to 4.2 million barrels a day to try to win back old
customers, even if it means starting a price war.  Iran, historically the second-largest oil producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi
Arabia , has slipped to sixth place, producing 2.56 million
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies against Iran over
the past year to curb its nuclear program have restricted the
country’s oil exports.  “Revival of Iran’s lost oil markets is among my top
priorities,” Zanganeh said in an interview, Fars News agency
 reported . “We only ask those who have replaced us in the
world’s oil markets to know that when we are re-entering these
markets they will have to accept that the  oil prices  decline or
they should reduce their production to create enough space for
Iran’s oil.”  American and European Union sanctions cut Iran’s exports by
about a million barrels a day as part of a broader effort to
press the country to halt its uranium enrichment activities.
Western powers suspect the enrichment is part of a plan to
produce nuclear weapons, something Iran denies.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
