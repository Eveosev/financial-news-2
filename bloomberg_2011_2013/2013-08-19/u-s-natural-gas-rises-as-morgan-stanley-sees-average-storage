U.S. natural gas futures rose,
extending the biggest weekly gain since May, as Morgan Stanley
predicted that storage levels at the end of October will be in
line with the last three years.  Gas for delivery in September climbed 2.2 percent to $3.44
per million British thermal units in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 8:58 a.m. London time. It gained
4.3 percent last week, the most since the five days to May 24.  Natural gas in storage will be approximately 3.86 trillion
cubic feet by the end of October, Morgan Stanley analysts Adam
Longson and Tai Liu in  New York  wrote in an e-mailed report. The
average futures price will be $3.42 per million Btu in the third
quarter and $3.69 in the fourth, according to the analysts.  Gas has tumbled 22 percent from its 2013 high in April as
mild weather trimmed air-conditioning demand from power plants.
Futures gave up an advance for the year as stockpiles swelled to
a surplus and the peak cooling season neared an end. The
contract is still 70 percent above the 100-day moving average.  Today’s price compares with $2.72 per million Btu a year
ago and $3.44 on the same day in 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contract fell to a 10-year low of
$1.902 per million Btu April 19, 2012 as storage levels
approached full.  Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on U.S. natural gas to the
lowest level in five months, capping a 52 percent drop since
April’s record high, as prospects faded for a weather-driven
rally.  Money managers reduced net-long positions, or  wagers  on
rising prices, by 9.9 percent in the seven days ended Aug. 13,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Aug. 16
Commitments of Traders report. It was the lowest level since
March 5 and the largest drop in nine weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
