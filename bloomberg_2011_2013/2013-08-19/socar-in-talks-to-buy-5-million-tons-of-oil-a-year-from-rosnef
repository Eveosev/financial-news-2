State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan is in
talks to buy 5 million metric tons of Urals crude a year from
 OAO (ROSN)  Rosneft, part of which will be re-exported through the BP
Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and part refined in Baku.  Socar, as the Azeri company is known, plans to complete the
talks by the year-end, President Rovnaq Abdullayev said today in
the capital. The crude will be shipped through the “reverse
flow” of the Baku-Novorossiysk pipeline, Abdullayev said.  Azerbaijan currently uses Baku-Novorossiysk to ship smaller
volumes of oil to the Black Sea port, with 2 million tons sent
last year. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in May ordered
a halt to Azeri crude exports via the pipeline from Jan. 1.  Socar and Rosneft agreed last week to set up a 50-50 joint
venture to explore and produce natural gas in Azerbaijan,  Russia 
and elsewhere. They will also cooperate in oil and oil-product
sales and use of infrastructure such as pipelines and terminals.  Rosneft is interested in Socar’s Caspian energy operations
and the Azeri company is interested in joining Rosneft projects,
Abdullayev said without elaborating. Rosneft is also interested
in cooperating in oil trading with Socar through the Fujairah
and Ceyhan ports, as well as in Singapore and  Africa , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
