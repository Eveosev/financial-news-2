Gold exports from the U.K. to
Switzerland in the first half of 2013 were more than eight times
the total for all of 2012 as metal was probably moved from
Europe to investors in Asia, Macquarie Group Ltd. said.  U.K. gold exports were 797 metric tons in the first six
months this year, compared with 92 tons for all of 2012,
Macquarie said in an e-mailed report dated today. Investors sold
586 tons of gold in exchange-traded products in January through
June this year,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Gold ETFs are part of the physical gold market and if
investors don’t want the gold it has to go somewhere else,”
Matthew Turner, an analyst at Macquarie, wrote in the report.
“The Chinese are simply willing to pay more for it.”  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.8 percent to $1,365.27
an ounce by 5:39 p.m. in  London , bringing the drop this year to
19 percent. Bullion is heading for the worst year since 1997
after 12 consecutive gains.  Most of the world’s gold refining capacity is in
Switzerland and refineries’ business was “very strong” in the
first half as Asian physical demand climbed, Turner wrote.  Global jewelry demand jumped 37 percent to 575.5 tons in
the second quarter, and combined global bar and coin sales
advanced 78 percent from a year earlier to an all-time high of
507.6 tons, the World Gold Council said in a report Aug. 15.
 India  is the biggest gold buyer, followed by  China .  Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, the largest
investor in the  SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) , the biggest ETP for the metal,
cut his holdings by more than a half in the second quarter from
the first three months of the year, a government filing showed
last week. Billionaire  George Soros  and Daniel Loeb sold their
entire SPDR stakes in the past quarter, U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filings showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
