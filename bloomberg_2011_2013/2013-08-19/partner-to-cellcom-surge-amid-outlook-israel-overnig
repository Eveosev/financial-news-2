Partner Communications Co. (PTNR)  and
 Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL) ,  Israel ’s two largest mobile-phone
providers, rallied in New York on prospects easing competition
in the sector will help stem declining revenue and earnings.  American depositary receipts of Partner jumped 4.3 percent
to the highest since February 2012, narrowing its discount to
the shares in Tel Aviv. The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of
the most-traded Israeli stocks in New York slipped 0.4 percent
as  Gazit-Globe Ltd. (GZT)  dropped the most in two months.  Prolor
Biotech Inc. (PBTH)  rose to a three-year high before  Opko Health Inc. (OPK) 
begins trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange tomorrow as it
completes the acquisition of the Israeli drugmaker.  Cellcom’s average revenue per user increased for the first
time in three years, the company said in a statement yesterday.
Partner, which is scheduled to report earnings on Aug. 28,
rallied to the highest valuation level since May 2011 to trade
at  8.4 times  estimated earnings, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Both companies have grappled with increasing
competition from Israeli discount operators Hot
Telecommunication System Ltd. and Golan Telecom Ltd.  “We see some bottoming out in the mobile sector,” Roni Biron, an analyst at UBS AG in  Tel Aviv , said by phone. “People
at least have a bit comfort. People are looking for business
metrics at Partner to stabilize in its earnings report from
mobile companies that have reported.”  The Bloomberg Israel-US measure declined for a third day,
closing at 96.91. The  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  declined 0.2 percent at 10:02
a.m. in Tel Aviv as Cellcom dropped 1.4 percent and Partner slid
1 percent.  Sales Increase  Cellcom, the nation’s largest mobile operator, and No. 2
Partner lost market share and reduced prices over the past year
after Hot Telecommunication and Golan entered the market in May
2012 and began offering unlimited monthly wireless packages for
less than 50 shekels ($13.93).  Partner’s second-quarter sales may increase 42 percent from
a year earlier to $566.2 million, according to the average
estimate of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be
the  first increase  since the third quarter of 2011.  Cellcom climbed 3.7 percent to a 15-month high of $11.54 in
New York. Partner’s ADRs rose 4.3 percent to $8.06.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) , an Israeli maker of equipment
that speeds electronic data transfers, dropped 2.9 percent to
$41.01 in New York, slumping the most in a week. Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC analyst William Choi cut his 12-month  price
estimate  for Mellanox to $65 from $68, reiterating a buy rating.  The Tel Aviv shares lost 1 percent today to 147.5 shekels,
or the equivalent of $41.12.  Opko Listing  Gazit-Globe, a real-estate company based in Tel Aviv, sank
3.4 percent to $13, sliding the most in two months. Trading
volume on the stock was twice the daily average over the past
three months. The Tel Aviv shares slid 0.9 percent today to
46.17 shekels, or $12.87.  Prolor jumped 3.9 percent to $7.73 in  New York , the highest
level since June 2010. The Tel Aviv listing of Opko, which
announced in April a deal to acquire Prolor, would enable Opko
to pay Prolor shareholders in locally listed stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
