Hog futures fell for the third
straight session, heading for the longest slump this month, on
signs of slowing demand for U.S. pork as supplies increase.
Cattle were little changed.  Meatpackers processed an estimated 2.177 million hogs last
week, up 7.8 percent from a week earlier, government data show.
Wholesale- pork  prices fell 1.7 percent last week, the first
decline in a month, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Futures lost 1.6 percent in the previous two sessions.  “Slaughter numbers are going to pick up,” Chad Henderson,
a market analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. “Products
were lower on the week. You just have people who are long this
market a little bit nervous.”  Hog futures for October settlement slid 0.2 percent to
86.575 cents a pound at 10:24 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators increased their
bullish wagers by 3.7 percent to 80,911 futures and options
contracts in the week ended Aug. 13, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data showed on Aug. 16. That marked the
highest since the reports began in 2006.  The “massive” net-long position spurred market concerns
because demand may ebb heading into the fourth quarter,
Henderson said.  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
$1.281 a pound in  Chicago .  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement added 0.4
percent to $1.58275 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
