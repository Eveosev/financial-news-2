Yields on  Poland ’s 10-year
government bonds increased for a sixth day as July wages rose
the most since February, adding to signs of recovery in the
European Union’s largest eastern economy.  The  yields  on the securities jumped nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 4.44 percent at 3:51 p.m. in Warsaw,
the highest since June 24. The zloty declined 0.4 percent to
4.2486 against the euro, curbing its quarter-to-date gain to 1.8
percent, still the best performance among emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Poland’s corporate  wages  rose 3.5 percent in the 12 months
to July, beating a 2.8 percent median estimate in Bloomberg
survey of 28 economists. The Narodowy Bank Polski adopted a
neutral view on monetary policy after lowering its  benchmark
rate  to a record 2.5 percent on July 3, with Governor Marek Belka predicting gradual acceleration of the economy.  “Today’s release is further evidence of a rebound in the
Polish economy,” BRE Bank SA economists, led by Ernest Pytlarczyk, wrote in a note. “The ongoing recovery will
strengthen expectations of interest rate hikes and steepen the
yield curve.”  Turning Corner  Inflation and gross domestic product grew more than
anticipated, data showed last week, after the economy expanded
at the slowest pace in four years in the first quarter.  Consumer
prices (POCPIYOY)  jumped to 1.1 percent in the 12 months to July from
record-low 0.2 percent in June, while second-quarter  GDP (POGDYOY) 
increased 0.8 percent from last year, compared with 0.5 percent
in the first three months of the year.  The  yields  on two-year bonds rose three basis points to a
seven-week high 3.10 percent. The spread between 10-year and
two-year bonds widened to 131 basis points, or 1.31 percentage
point, the most in two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
