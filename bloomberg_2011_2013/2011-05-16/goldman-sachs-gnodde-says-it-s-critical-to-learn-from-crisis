Richard Gnodde, co-chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs International, comments on competition
in financial markets. He spoke at a Cass Business School panel
discussion in  London  today.  “It is very clear that we are all trying to get to the
same place. Our view of the liberalized markets is really based
on the idea of free competition and not on deregulation. I think
it’s very important to reinforce this message, and it has been
well covered this morning.”  “The openness of financial markets globally will clearly
go into reverse if the view becomes entrenched that opening your
market for financial services implies weaker supervision. It
clearly doesn’t.”  “Clearly, there has been a huge discussion over the last
number of years and the debate about the role of government and
regulation in the markets. It is critical we learn the right
lessons from the banking crisis and most importantly we
establish a framework which ensures that the cost of a future
crisis will fall where it belongs and that is on the
institutions who fail, their shareholders and not on the
taxpayer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
