Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africa’s biggest mobile-network operator, increased to the
highest level in almost two weeks after it appointed Ahmed Abou Doma as chief executive officer.  The shares rose 1.2 percent to 4.14 Egyptian pounds at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the highest since May 3. That valued
the company at 21.7 billion pounds ($3.7 billion). The company’s
global depositary receipts gained 1.5 percent at 2:53 p.m. in
 London .  “Abou doma has a very good track record as he’s run a
successful operation at Bangalink,” said Amr El-Alfy, deputy
director of research at Cairo-based Commercial International
Brokerage. “Promoting from within also creates a good
atmosphere for Orascom employees.”  Abou Doma, a former CEO of the Cairo-based company’s
wholly-owned Bangladeshi unit,  Bangalink , and marketing director
at Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services, or Mobinil, replaces Khaled
Bichara, who was appointed chief executive of parent company,
Wind Telecom SpA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
