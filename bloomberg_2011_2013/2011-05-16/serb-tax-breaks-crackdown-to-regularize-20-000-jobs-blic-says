Serbia’s temporary reduction in
payroll taxes should persuade companies to report at least
20,000 employees who are currently working off the books,  Blic 
reported, citing Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric.  The initiative, announced last week, is part of a “carrot
and stick” approach to cracking down on  tax evasion , Ciric told
the newspaper.  In addition to making it easier for employers to report
people who work for them, the government plans increased
enforcement by tax and labor inspectors, the newspaper reported.
All employers caught using unreported workers “will be punished
to the full extent of the law,” Ciric was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
