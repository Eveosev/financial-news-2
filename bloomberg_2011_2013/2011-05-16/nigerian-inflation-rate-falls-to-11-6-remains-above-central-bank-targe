Nigeria ’s inflation rate declined to
11.6 percent in April as the central bank struggles to bring it
below 10 percent.  The inflation rate fell from 12.8 percent a month earlier,
the  National Bureau of Statistics  said in a statement released
today in the capital, Abuja.  Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi on March 22 raised the
benchmark interest rate for a second time this year, lifting it
one percentage point to 7.5 percent to stabilize the naira and
slow inflation. Further rate increases may be limited to
stimulate lending and because pressure on the naira to weaken
has eased, Sanusi said on May 5.  The bank “is expected to keep interest rates unchanged
when the Monetary Policy Committee meets” next week,  Bismarck Rewane , chief executive officer of Lagos-based brokerage
Financial Derivatives Co., said by phone today.  Demand for dollars at central bank auctions peaked at
$586.4 million on March 28, before dropping to a low of $277.1
million on April 27. The central bank keeps the naira within 3
percent of 150 to the dollar at the auctions.  Nigeria’s economy, the third biggest on the continent after
 South Africa  and  Egypt , will grow about 7.9 percent in the
second quarter, according to the statistics office. The economy
is projected to expand 7.98 percent this year, compared with
7.85 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
