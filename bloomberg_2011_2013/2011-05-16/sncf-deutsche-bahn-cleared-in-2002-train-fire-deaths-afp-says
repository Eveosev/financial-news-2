Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Francais  and  Deutsche Bahn  AG were cleared by a French court of
charges of manslaughter and causing injuries in a 2002 fire on a
Paris-to-Munich train that killed 12,  Agence France-Presse 
reported, citing a lawyer for some of the victims’ families.  A conductor was found guilty and received a suspended
sentence of one year for alerting his colleagues, rather than
trying to put out the flames, when clothing hung near a heating
board caught fire, AFP said.  Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s state-owned railway, has installed
some safety equipment following the incident, the Berlin-based
company said today in a statement that took note of the French
court ruling clearing the German train operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
