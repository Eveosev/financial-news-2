Enernoc Inc. (ENOC) , an electricity demand-
reduction service, surged as much as 16 percent after
forecasting that sales within the  power grid  operated by PJM
Interconnection LLC will exceed $275 million in 2014.  Enernoc rose at much as $3.05, or 18 percent, to $20.10 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The share were at $19.79, up 16
percent, at 10:25 a.m, trimming the Boston-based company’s loss
this year to 18 percent.  Rising demand for Enernoc’s energy-reduction services
during periods of high electricity use are expected to boost its
revenue, based on an auction for its services to be provided in
2014 and 2015 that PJM announced on May 13, Enernoc said today
in a statement. Norristown, Pennsylvania-based PJM runs the
 electricity market  and grid in 13 states stretching from
Illinois to New Jersey.  Enernoc aggregates electricity consumption from multiple
companies, which receive lower power rates in exchange for
allowing their service to be cut at times of high demand. The
company’s sales in the first quarter were $31.8 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
