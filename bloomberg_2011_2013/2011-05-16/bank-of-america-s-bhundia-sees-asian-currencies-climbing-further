Ashok Bhundia, a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch comments on Asian
currencies and interest rates. He spoke at the bank’s 2011
Global Macro Forum in Hong Kong today.  “A number of central banks in the region are more ready to
allow a slightly faster rate of appreciation of foreign
exchange. One of the reasons is a lot of the headline inflation
we’re seeing from the supply side is flipping into  core
inflation . Secondly, export performance is now accelerating once
again so there’s less concern that would affect growth.”  “My best guess is what’s priced in the yield curve is
going to underestimate what the central banks are going to
deliver. We are in the second phase of tightening.”  “We are going to get slightly more foreign exchange
appreciation but also steady follow-through on the rate hike
cycle. We are in the middle, rather than the end or the
beginning, of the rate hike cycle.”  “There’s always one eye on the renminbi. The dynamics
there is for further renminbi appreciation and there’s some
uncertainty of how fast. There’s a weak dollar in the background
which makes it a little bit easier.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
