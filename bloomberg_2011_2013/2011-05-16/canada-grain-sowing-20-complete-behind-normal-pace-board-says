Grain planting in  Canada  is about 20
percent complete, trailing the normal pace of just over 50
percent at this time of year, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  Alberta and parts of Saskatchewan had “favorable weather”
last week, allowing for a “dramatic increase in seeding
progress,” the board said today in an e-mailed statement. A
week earlier, only about 4 percent of crops were planted.  In south-central and southeastern Manitoba some planting is
under way, while seeding may not start for another week in much
of the province and southeastern Saskatchewan because of wet
conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
