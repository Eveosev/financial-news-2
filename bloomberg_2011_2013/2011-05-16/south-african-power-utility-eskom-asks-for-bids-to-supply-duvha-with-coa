Eskom Holdings Ltd.,  South Africa ’s
state-owned electricity producer, called for proposals to supply
its Duvha power plant with coal as the company tries to meet
growing demand in the continent’s largest economy.  Eskom, based in Johannesburg, is seeking to secure 3
million metric tons of coal a year from 2015 until the end of
2024, it said in  tender document  published on its website today.
Interested bidders have until June 10 to submit their proposals.  Duvha , located in South Africa’s Mpumalanga province, has a
total installed capacity of 3,600 megawatts. Construction of the
plant started in November 1975 and the last of its six units
came online in 1984, according to Eskom’s website.  The utility is spending 460 billion-rand ($65.4 billion)
increasing its capacity in an effort to reduce blackouts and
outages, which in early 2008 left some of the world’s largest
platinum mines without power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
