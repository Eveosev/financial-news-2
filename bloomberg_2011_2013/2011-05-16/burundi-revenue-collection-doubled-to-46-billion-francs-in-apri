Burundi more than doubled revenue
collection in April to 46 billion Burundian francs ($37 million)
from 22.9 billion francs a year earlier, the Burundi Revenue
Authority said.  The increase brought total revenue collected in the first
four months of 2011 to 169.3 billion francs, the Bujumbura-based
authority said in a statement on its  website . It didn’t provide
a comparative figure for the same period a year earlier.  In the first quarter, 123.3 billion francs was collected by
the agency, compared with 95.1 billion francs a year earlier,
the authority said in a separate statement. In December, Finance
Minister Clotilde Nizigama forecast total revenue in 2011 would
be 432.6 billion francs.  Burundi relies on coffee to generate two-thirds of the East
African nation’s exports and the industry is the main source of
income for about 800,000 households in one of the world’s
poorest nations, according to the  International Monetary Fund .
Growth in the East African nation is expected to accelerate to
4.5 percent in 2011 and 4.8 percent in 2012, from an estimated
3.9 percent this year, the IMF said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
