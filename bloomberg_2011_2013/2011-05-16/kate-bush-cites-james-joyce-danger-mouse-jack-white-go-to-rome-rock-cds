Blame  James Joyce  for Kate Bush’s new
album “Director’s Cut.”  When she planned “The Sensual World,” the title track of
a 1989 LP, Bush had wanted to cite Molly Bloom’s orgasmic
monologue from the end of Joyce’s novel “Ulysses.” The Irish
writer’s estate refused, and the singer wrote her own lyric.  Bush, 52, now has been given permission to use Molly’s
passionate thoughts and reworked the song, retitled “Flower of
the Mountain.” It’s a breathtaking start to a CD that revises
songs off her 1989 album and 1993’s “The Red Shoes.”  “This Woman’s Work” also gets a radical makeover and is a
revelation, stripped down to ambient keyboards.  Still, other tracks are only gently tweaked, making the
result more of a fans-only remix rather than Bush’s ninth proper
album. The notorious perfectionist’s last release was the
impressive “Aerial” in 2005, her first in 12 years.  It would have made more sense for Bush to revisit her first
records, where she had less control of production and struggled
to capture her teenage vision. The squeaks and whoops of her
1978 debut single “Wuthering Heights” would be fascinating to
hear in a 2011 form.  Rating: ***.  Danger Mouse, the producer with the silly name who’s taken
seriously in rock circles, continues his creative spurt with
“Rome.” Between his work for Broken Bells, Gnarls Barkley and
producing U2, he has been working for five years on a project,
inspired by music from spaghetti westerns, with the Italian
composer  Daniele Luppi .  Mouse, or Brian Burton as he’s known to friends, conjures
an Ennio Morricone-style soundtrack for a Clint Eastwood movie.
There’s plenty of good, and little bad or ugly.  Listeners can only imagine the characters that could roam
across the screen in sync with music such as “The Gambling
Priest” and “The Matador Has Fallen.”  “Rome” avoids pastiche and is helped by strong vocals
from Jack White and Norah Jones.  Rating: ****.  Moby has built a career out of blending blues, gospel and
folk into a techno-dance stew. He reached an early high point
with 1999’s “Play.”  Since then, he has gone around in artistic circles, often
with diminishing creative returns. His new “Destroyed” is on a
par with the lackluster predecessor “Wait for Me.” Its
downbeat sound is dull, rather than entrancing.  Download only the closing “When You Are Old,” a
meditation that’s as hypnotic as anything Moby has done.  Rating: **.  Kate Bush is on EMI/Fish People. Her CD is out in the U.S.
on May 23 as a single disc at $13 or on May 31 as a $33 box,
including remastered versions of “The Sensual World” and “The
Red Shoes.” It’s out in the U.K. now, priced about 9 pounds for
a single disc or 18 pounds for the set.  Danger Mouse is on Capitol/Parlophone and Moby on Little
Idiot/Mute. Both new CDs are priced about $10 or 8 pounds. The
Moby title also has a deluxe edition with a hardcover book and
expanded artwork. Download fees vary across services.
