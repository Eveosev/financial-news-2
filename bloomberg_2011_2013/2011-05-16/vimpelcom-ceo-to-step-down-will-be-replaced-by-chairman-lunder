VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) ,  Russia ’s third-
largest wireless carrier by subscribers, named Chairman Jo Lunder to succeed Alexander Izosimov as chief executive officer.  Lunder, who is currently executive vice president at
Norwegian investor Ferd Capital, will take over the post after
Izosimov steps down on June 30, Amsterdam-based VimpelCom said
in a statement today. Augie Fabela, a founder and former
chairman of VimpelCom, was nominated to succeed Lunder as
chairman.  Izosimov completed a merger with Wind Telecom SpA last
month, forming the world’s sixth-largest phone company by
subscriber numbers. The deal, valued at about $6.5 billion when
it was announced Oct. 4, doubles VimpelCom’s mobile-customer
base to about 181 million in 20 countries. Izosimov said in Feb.
2009 that he planned to step down from VimpelCom’s predecessor
company, OAO VimpelCom, in 2010, to spend more time with his
family.  “We completed two groundbreaking transactions within the
past year that have transformed the company into a top-tier
global telecoms operator,” Lunder said in the statement. “I am
looking forward to leading VimpelCom to new heights and to
extracting maximum value for all of our shareholders by focusing
on operational performance and our respective market
positions.”  Lunder previously served as CEO and chief operating officer
at VimpelCom at various times between 1999 and 2003, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
