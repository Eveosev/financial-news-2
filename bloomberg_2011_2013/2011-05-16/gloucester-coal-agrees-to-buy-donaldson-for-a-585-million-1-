Gloucester Coal Ltd. (GCL) , an Australian
coal mining unit of commodity trader  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) , agreed to
pay A$360 million ($380 million) in shares to buy Donaldson Coal
Ltd. from Noble.  Gloucester will also seek to sell A$230 million in shares
to pay Donaldson’s A$225 million debt and buy other assets from
Noble, the Sydney-based company said today in a statement. The
shares will be sold at A$9 a share to existing investors, 9.1
percent less than Gloucester’s last traded price.  Buying Donaldson will give Gloucester three mining
operations in Australia’s  Hunter Valley , producing energy and
steelmaking coal as demand in  Asia  grows. Demand for coal
triggered deals worth $10.1 billion in the first quarter, the
strongest start to the year in at least five years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Noble gained control of Gloucester Coal in 2009 and
currently owns a 65 percent stake. Donaldson is also a
foundation investor in Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group,
operator of a Port of Newcastle’s coal export terminal.  Gloucester fell 0.5 percent to A$9.90 at the May 6 close of
Sydney trading, the last day before it was halted. UBS AG and
Citigroup Global Markets  Australia  Pty Ltd. are underwriters for
the issue.  Prices for thermal coal at Newcastle, a benchmark for Asia,
may average $130 a metric ton in 2011, the median forecast of
seven analysts surveyed last month by Bloomberg shows. That
compares with $99 a ton last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and IHS McCloskey, a Petersfield, England-based
researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
