The  International Air Transport
Association , known as  IATA , suspended Air Zimbabwe for non-
payment of booking fees, U.K.-based  Nehanda Radio  said, citing
an IATA statement.  The state-owned airline owes IATA about $280,000, Nehanda
Radio said on its website. The ban wonâ€™t affect Zimbabweans
already booked to fly on Air Zimbabwe, though foreigners
traveling to the southern African nation may encounter
difficulties, Nehanda Radio added.  Pilots employed by Air Zimbabwe ended a monthlong strike
April 21 after protesting unpaid salaries and allowances dating
back to February last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
