Investors may not have to wait until
next year for companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to
earn more than $100 a share as a group, according to UBS AG.  “We are in a good profit environment now,” Thomas Doerflinger, a UBS strategist, wrote today in a report. He
raised the firm’s S&P 500 earnings estimate for this year to
$101 a share from $96.  Doerflinger’s estimate is the first to exceed the $100
threshold among 14 securities firms in a Bloomberg survey. The
previous high was the $99 projected by Deutsche Bank AG’s Bankim Chadha, who raised his estimate from $96 last week.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the mean earnings estimate for
2011, according to the strategist survey. Even before Chadha’s
revision, the mean increased to $94.65 a share last week from
$94.26 a week earlier. The comparable figure for 2012 was
$103.10.  Higher  oil prices  were largely responsible for UBS’s
increase, according to Doerflinger. Profit gains for the S&P
500’s energy producers will exceed declines in other industries
because of rising energy costs, he wrote.  Productivity growth, stock repurchases, a falling dollar
and gains in emerging markets also contributed, the report said.
UBS raised its S&P 500 earnings projection for next year by $4 a
share, to $108.  Citigroup Inc. increased estimates yesterday, based on
first-quarter results. Steven C. Wieting, managing director of
economic and market analysis, now sees S&P 500 profits of $98 a
share for this year and $105 next year. The projections were
raised from $96.50 and $103.50, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
