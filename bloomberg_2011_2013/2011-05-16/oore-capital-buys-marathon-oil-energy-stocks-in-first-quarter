energy companies including Marathon Oil Corp., EOG Resources
Inc. and Massey Energy Co. during the first quarter.  The New York-based fund bought 1.15 million shares in
Houston-based Marathon, which were valued at $61.3 million as of

its third-largest holding, by 815,000 shares, leaving it with a
stake worth $75.3 million at the end of the quarter.  Moore sold its holdings of the iShares MSCI Emerging
