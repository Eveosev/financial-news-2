Posco (005490) ’s A  credit rating  could be
downgraded if the debt-to-equity ratio of  South Korea ’s biggest
steelmaker expands because of large investments or purchases,
 Standard & Poor’s  said.  The ratings company lowered Posco’s credit outlook to
“negative” from “stable” because the company’s weak
financial profile may not improve over the next 12 months,
Sangyun Han, a S&P’s analyst, said today in a report.  S&P’s move came after global rival Moody’s Investors
Service said on March 31 it placed Posco on review for possible
downgrade because of its higher-than-expected financial leverage
in 2010. Posco had announced in a May 13 regulatory filing it
will submit a final bid for a stake in Korea Express Co.  “Any large acquisition, such as Posco’s bid for Korea
Express, could lead us to lower the ratings over the next
several months, particularly if the company pays a high premium
to outbid competitors,” Han said in the report. “A significant
reduction in Posco’s investment plans or stronger-than-expected
operating performance would also be triggers to revise the
outlook back to stable.”  Posco invested more than 9.4 trillion won ($8.6 billion)
last year, including the acquisition of trading company Daewoo
International Corp. for 3.4 trillion won, according to the
report. The world’s third-biggest steelmaker reported a 33
percent drop in first-quarter profit as raw material costs
increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
