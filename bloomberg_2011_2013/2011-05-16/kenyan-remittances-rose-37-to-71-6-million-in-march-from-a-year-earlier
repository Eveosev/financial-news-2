Kenyans living abroad sent home a
record $71.6 million in March, up 37 percent from a year
earlier, as the economies of the U.S. and  Europe  expanded, the
countryâ€™s  central bank  said.  Remittances to the East African nation climbed to $196.5
million in the first quarter from $143.8 million in the year-
earlier period, the Nairobi-based  Central Bank of Kenya  said in
a statement on its website today.  Kenya relied on  North America  for about 53 percent of its
remittance flows in March and Europe for 27 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
