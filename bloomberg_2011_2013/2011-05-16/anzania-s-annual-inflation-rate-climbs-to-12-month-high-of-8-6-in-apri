Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to
a 12-month high of 8.6 percent in April on increased energy and
food prices.  Inflation accelerated from 8 percent in March, Ephraim Kwesigabo, an official at the National Bureau of Statistics,
told reporters today in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital.  Energy costs rose an annual 22.1 percent, compared with
17.2 percent in March after regulators raised the so-called
indicative price of gasoline to 2,003 Tanzanian shillings
($1.32) a liter on April 28 from 1,927 shillings on March 30.  Annual food-price inflation accelerated to 9.2 percent in
April from 8.3 percent the month before, Kwesigabo said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
