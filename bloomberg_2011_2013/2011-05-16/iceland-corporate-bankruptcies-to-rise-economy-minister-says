About a quarter of Icelandic
companies with debts between 10 million kronur ($86,400) and 1
billion kronur are likely to fail, the government said in an
estimate today.  Of Iceland’s 5,977 companies, 1,974 won’t need to
restructure their bank loans, while 1,925 have negotiated more
lenient repayment terms, the  Economy Ministry  said in a
statement on its  website . A further 526 companies may need to
negotiate repayment terms, while another 1,552 companies may
face bankruptcy.  “The odds are that the majority of companies falling under
an agreement on debt restructuring for small and medium size
companies will be offered a solution by June 1,” the ministry
said in the statement. “Small and medium sized companies
account for a large portion of the country’s economic output and
represent about 90 percent of the country’s corporations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
