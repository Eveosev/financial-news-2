South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress  may win 59 percent of the vote in municipal
elections on May 18, down from 66 percent in 2006, according to
a survey from polling company Ipsos.  Of the 2,050 likely voters surveyed from mid-April, 19.3
percent said they’d vote for the opposition Democratic Alliance,
Ipsos said in an e-mailed statement from Johannesburg today. The
DA won 14.8 percent support in polls five years ago.  Support for the ANC, which is led by President  Jacob Zuma ,
has weakened as job losses mount in a country where one in four
people are unemployed and the government struggles to combat
corruption. Voters will this week select mayors and local
councilors to control districts and cities across the country,
including Johannesburg,  Cape Town  and Durban.  “The  African National Congress  remains the strongest
political party in the country, although their support seems to
have decreased since the 2009 general election” when it won 66
percent of the vote,  Ipsos (IPSOF)  said.  About 2 percent of those polled by Ipsos will vote for
Inkatha Freedom Party and 1 percent for the Congress of the
People, which was formed in 2009 by disgruntled ANC members. The
United Democratic Movement will probably win 0.3 percent of the
vote, Ipsos said. No margin of error was given in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
