Benetton Group SpA (BEN)  will start
production at a factory in Nis, southern  Serbia , by July 15
after buying the facility last week,  Blic  reported, citing the
city’s mayor.  Italy’s largest clothing retailer plans annual turnover of
72 million euros ($102 million) in Serbia, the Belgrade-based
newspaper quoted Mayor Milos Simonovic as saying.  Benetton bought the eight-hectare (20-acre) compound of
apparel maker Nitex d.o.o. for 3 million euros, the state
Privatization Agency said May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
