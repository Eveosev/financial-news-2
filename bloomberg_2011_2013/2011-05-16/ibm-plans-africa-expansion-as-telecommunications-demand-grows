International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
plans to open 10 new offices in Africa, bringing its total
locations on the continent to 35 by 2015 as it starts operations
in  Senegal , Tanzania and Angola.  “Africa today is the new market for IBM,” said Mamadou
Ndiaye, director general of IBM Senegal.  The company has invested $300 million in new Africa
operations since 2006, he said in an interview in Dakar May 13.
By 2015, the world’s biggest computer-services provider expects
to operate in at least 23 countries on the continent, said Gary
Carroll, IBM’s general manager of Africa Geo-Expansion.  IBM, based in Armonk,  New York , also wants to tap into
Africa’s growing mobile-banking market by working with
telecommunications companies on the continent, as it expects
spending on  information technology  to expand 47 percent to $12.5
billion by 2015, according to a statement.  In Senegal, IBM is vying for contracts to improve
management of the nation’s energy grid, said Ndiaye. It
currently runs a customs-collection monitoring system at
Senegal’s borders, he said.  IBM fell 64 cents to $169.28 at 2:21 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had climbed 16 percent
this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
