Nine energy producers announced the
start of the  Subsea Well Response Project  to enable them to
respond better to underwater well-control incidents.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will operate the joint project, which
will design equipment to cap wells and inject dispersant into
the sea bed, the group said in an e-mailed statement today. The
companies will also assess the need for and feasibility of a
shared containment system.  The project, a response to recommendations from the
International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, aims to reduce
the likelihood and impact of incidents such as  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Macondo
well blowout last year that caused the worst U.S. oil spill, and
the 2009 Montara spill off Australia’s northwest coast.  “These recommendations comprise a fundamental package of
safety and response initiatives for the industry and represent
its response to recent accidents such as Macondo and Montara,”
the association, known as OGP said in a separate statement.  BG Group Plc (BG/) , BP,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP) ,  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Shell,  Statoil ASA (STL)  and
 Total SA (FP)  are members of the Subsea Well Response Project.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
