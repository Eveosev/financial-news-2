percent to S$1.03. The company reported a first-quarter loss of
S$3.99 million ($3.2 million), according to a  Singapore  stock
exchange announcement.  Armstrong Industrial Corp. (ARMS SP), a supplier of
components used in the electronics and automotive industries,
dropped 5.2 percent to 36.5 Singapore cents. The company was cut
to “underperform” from “neutral” at CIMB-GK Securities.  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. (NOL SP),  Southeast Asia ’s
biggest container-shipping line, fell 2.1 percent to S$1.86. The
company posted its first quarterly loss in a year as rising fuel
prices and global overcapacity offset increasing demand.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  , the world’s second-
largest carrier by market value, declined 0.8 percent to S$14.54.
The company was cut to “sell” from “buy” at Citigroup Inc.,
which said its special dividend doesn’t detract from its
“weak” fourth-quarter results and operating outlook.  The brokerage reduced its share-price forecast to S$13.90
from S$16, analysts led by Robert Kong wrote in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
