Russia  plans to raise its export duty
on most crude shipments by 1.9 percent on June 1 to the highest
level since 2008 after  oil prices  climbed.  The standard duty will probably increase to $462.10 a
metric ton ($63.04 a barrel) from $453.70 a ton in May,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on Finance Ministry
data. Oil taxes reached a high of $495.90 a ton in August and
September 2008.  The discounted rate on some oil pumped via Russia’s East
Siberian-Pacific Ocean pipeline to  Asia  and from the  Caspian Sea 
may reach $217.50 a ton from $211.70 in May. OAO Rosneft’s
Vankor project, TNK-BP’s Verkhnechonsk and OAO Surgutneftegas’s
Talakan have had to pay full taxes since May 1, under an  order 
signed last month by Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin .  Brent and Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, rose
above $100 a barrel in February as unrest in northern  Africa  and
the Middle East disrupted some oil flows. Russia sets its export
duties based on the average Urals price from the 15th day of one
month to the 14th day of the next. Urals averaged $116.23 during
the most recent monitoring period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said by phone today.  Putin must sign the draft for the rates to come into
effect.  A special gasoline tax that Putin imposed starting May 1 to
fight domestic shortages may be raised to $415.80 a ton if the
government extends the measure, Sakovich said. That is about 90
percent of the crude duty.  The export tax on light oil products may be increased to
$309.60 a ton from $304. The duty on heavy products may rise to
$215.80 a ton from $211.80 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
