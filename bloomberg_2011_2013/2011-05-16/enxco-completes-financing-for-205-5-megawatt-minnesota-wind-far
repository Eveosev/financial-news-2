EnXco Inc., the U.S. project
development unit of  EDF Energies Nouvelles SA (EEN) , completed
financing for a 205.5-megawatt wind farm in  Minnesota .  Dexia Credit Local SA and  Societe Generale  led a group of
lenders that provided a construction loan, a 15-year term loan
and a bridge loan for the Lakefield project, San Diego-based
EnXco said today in a statement.  Union Bank NA and  Metlife Inc. (MET) , which provided a portion of
the construction financing, will also provide long term
financing by purchasing the wind farm after it goes into
operation and leasing it back to EnXco. Other lenders that
participated in the funding included CoBank, Banco Santander SA,
Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen and Lloyds TSB Bank Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
