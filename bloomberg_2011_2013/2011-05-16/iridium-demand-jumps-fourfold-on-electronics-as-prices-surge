Iridium consumption jumped fourfold
last year, led by demand from makers of crucibles used to
manufacture light-emitting diodes, driving an 84 percent gain in
prices, Johnson Matthey Plc said.  Total demand advanced to 334,000 ounces, from 81,000
ounces, with consumption in the electrical industry surging to
194,000 ounces from 7,000 ounces, the London-based company said
in a report today. Prices for the platinum-group metal rose to
$780 an ounce by the end of 2010, from $425 at the end of 2009,
the company said. Iridium was at $1,050 today.  “Iridium crucible manufacture expanded suddenly and
rapidly during 2010,” Johnson Matthey said in the report. “The
small size of the iridium market helped amplify movements in the
price as industrial buyers built their stocks of working metal
in response to technology changes.”  This year’s percent gain in iridium prices outpaced the 5
percent rise in gold and the 11 percent advance in silver.
Platinum is little changed, while palladium dropped 11 percent.
Companies that mine iridium include Anglo American Platinum Ltd.
and Lonmin Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
