Yemen likely will experience
significant declines in tourism this year after three months of
anti-government protests,  Saba  said, citing a report by the
countryâ€™s Tourism Ministry.  Tourism revenue grew 28 percent in 2010 to almost $1.2
billion, the state-run  news agency  said today.  The number of tourists arriving last rose 32 percent last
year compared with 2007 to almost 1.25 million, with foreign
tourists comprising 52 percent of the total, Saba said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
