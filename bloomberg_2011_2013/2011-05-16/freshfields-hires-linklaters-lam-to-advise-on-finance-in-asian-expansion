Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP,
the top legal adviser for initial share sales in  Asia , hired
Howard Lam from rival Linklaters LLP to be a banking partner in
 Hong Kong , as it expands its finance practice in the region.  Lam’s appointment will help Freshfields advise on complex
financing work that will become a mainstay in Asia, Rob Ashworth, the firm’s Asia managing partner, said in an e-mailed
statement today. Lam will join in July.  Many international law firms including Davis Polk &
Wardwell LLP and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP are
expanding their offices in Hong Kong, home to the world’s
largest market for initial share sales, and as mergers and
acquisitions in Asia gather pace.  “Asia, with the possible exception of the  United States ,
is the highest-growth region for us,” Freshfields’s Managing
Partner Ted Burke told Bloomberg News.  The London-based firm in April named Teresa Ko to the new
role of  chairman of its China practice  and relocated mergers and
acquisitions partner Simon Weller to Hong Kong from  London .  The moves come after Freshfields lost Anthony Dapiran,
managing partner of its Beijing office, to Davis Polk, and
Christopher Wong, head of its China corporate practice, to
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP in the past year.  Freshfields has offices in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong,
Beijing,  Shanghai  and  Tokyo  with a total of 238 lawyers, 8.4 percent 
of its total as of end April.  ``We could see a 50 percent increase in Asia over the next
five years based on our current plans and projections,'' Ashworth
said in an interview in February of the firm's lawyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
