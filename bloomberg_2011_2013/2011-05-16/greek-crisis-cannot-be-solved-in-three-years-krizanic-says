Greece  should follow Belgium in
turning around its economy even though its fiscal crisis
probably won’t be solved in three years, Slovenia’s Finance
Minister  Franc Krizanic  said.  Slovenia contributed 207 million euros ($292 million) to
the Greece’s bailout with the total in loans and guarantees
pledged to Greece, Ireland and Portugal at 823 million euros,
Krizanic said. He spoke in an interview in Ljubljana on May 13.  On Greece:  “Belgium should be a good model for Greece. They had
similar problems and the solution was to extend the loan
maturities and moderate  interest rates  and Belgium climbed out
of the crisis.  “The question is, if Greece has a critical mass for the
turnaround and it seems it has as the economy now relies on
small companies, tourism and shipping. Greece managed to
increase exports, but this crisis cannot be solved in three
years.”  On the ‘Celtic model’:  “ Portugal  and Ireland have problems with competitiveness
and their exports while Greece is making big strides in that
direction and their fiscal position will also improve. Ireland
had a bubble in the financial sector, but their exports are
doing fine and I believe the ‘Celtic model’ hasn’t died out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
