Ukraine will reduce imports of
Russian natural gas in the second half as prices are set to
increase, said Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov .  “In the second half of the year we are going to buy
significantly less gas than in the first half, as the price will
be higher,” Azarov said on the government website.  Russia’s OAO Gazprom sells natural gas under a formula
linked to  oil prices  with a lag of about six months.  Brent crude 
has risen 19 percent this year.  “Main” gas purchases necessary for 2011 were made in the
first half, the prime minister said. Utility rates won’t be
increased through the end of the year, he said.  Ukraine is in a $15.6 billion loan program with the
 International Monetary Fund , which was approved in July. The
country has so far received two tranches, or $3.4 billion in
total, for  budget deficit  and currency reserves. The third
tranche, planned for March, is being delayed as the IMF expects
Ukraine to reduce its state budget deficit by finding ways to
compensate for lower-than-expected increases in gas tariffs.  A delegation is headed to  Washington  for talks with the IMF
in the “near future,” according to Azarov. The group,
including Finance Minister Fedir Yaroshenko, will “hold talks
with the IMF on an acceptable version to continue the
cooperation program,” Azarov said.  The Washington-based IMF also expects Ukrainian authorities
to ease the pension system’s pressure on the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
