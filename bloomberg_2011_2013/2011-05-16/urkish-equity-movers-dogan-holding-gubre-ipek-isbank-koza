Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 177.08, or 0.3 percent, to 63,523.22 at the 5:30 p.m.
end of trading in Istanbul on the day after voters elected Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  to a third term in office.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS, Turkey’s biggest listed
bank by assets, climbed to its highest level since May 17,
gaining 2 kurus, or 0.4 percent, to 5.12 liras. The Turkish
banking index, which has fallen 8.5 percent since the beginning
of the year, closed down 0.2 as investors looked to Erdogan’s
government to turn its attention to the economy after elections.  Migros Ticaret AS (MGROS)  , a supermarket chain, dropped
50 kurus, or 2.6 percent, to 18.60 liras. The company denied a
report in Turkey’s Ekonomist magazine that owners including BC
Partners Ltd. are planning to sell Tansas supermarkets, part of
the Migros group. Migros shares have fallen 4.9 percent since
June 8, when it announced it was selling its Sok discount
supermarket chain for 600 million liras ($379 million) to Bizim
Toptan Satis Magazalari AS and  Gozde Finansal Hizmetler AS. (GOZFN)   Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL TI), Turkey’s
largest mobile-phone company, reached a 10-month low, dropping
30 kurus, or 3.5 percent, to 8.38 liras after saying its Belarus
unit will lose as much as $200 million in the second quarter.  Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi AS (TSKB)  , an investment
and development bank, advanced 1 kurus, or 0.4 percent, to 2.48
liras, the first increase in four days. TSKB, which doesn’t take
consumer deposits, will be “immune” to more expected reserve
increases from the central bank, EFG Istanbul Securities said in
a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
