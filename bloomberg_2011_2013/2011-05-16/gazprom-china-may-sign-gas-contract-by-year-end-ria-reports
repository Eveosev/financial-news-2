OAO Gazprom plans to sign a contract
to supply natural gas to  China  by the end of the year, RIA
Novosti reported today, citing Alexander Medvedev, deputy chief
executive officer of the Russian export monopoly.  Gazprom and China are unlikely to sign the deal during the
St. Petersburg International Economic Forum next month, the news
service said, citing Medvedev.  Gazprom’s export unit declined to comment today when called
by Bloomberg News. Gazprom has said it aims to conclude a
commercial contract with China by the middle of 2011. Russia
hopes talks with China on a supply contract will be completed by
the forum,  Arkady Dvorkovich , President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s
economic adviser, said last week. The forum runs from June 16 to
18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
