Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. government should fund research and
development to boost economic growth while also supporting
science through education and immigration policies.  “In the abstract, economists have identified some
persuasive justifications for government policies to promote R&D
activities, especially those related to basic research,”
Bernanke said today in a speech in  Washington . At the same time,
“in a time of fiscal stringency, the Congress and the
Administration will clearly need to carefully weigh competing
priorities in their budgetary decisions,” he said.  Bernanke didn’t comment on the outlook for the economy or
monetary policy in the speech. U.S. growth slowed to a 1.8
percent annual pace in the first quarter from 3.1 percent in the
three months through December. Some economists have found that
expanded government support for research and development could
“significantly boost economic growth” over time, he said.  “We should also keep in mind that funding R&D activity is
only part of what the government can do to foster innovation,”
Bernanke said in prepared remarks at a conference at  Georgetown
University . “Ensuring a sufficient supply of individuals with
science and engineering skills is important for promoting
innovation, and this need raises questions about education
policy as well as immigration policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
