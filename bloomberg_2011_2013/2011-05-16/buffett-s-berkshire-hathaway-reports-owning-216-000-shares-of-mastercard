Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  reported a stake in  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the second-biggest
payments network, as the billionaire handed responsibility for
some of the portfolio to a new investment manager.  Buffett’s firm owned 216,000 shares of the company on March
31, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said today in a regulatory
filing listing its U.S. stock portfolio. Purchase,  New York- 
based MasterCard was the second-biggest holding at Todd Combs’s
Castle Point Capital Management LLC as of Sept. 30 before the
 money manager  joined Buffett’s firm.  Buffett, 80, is reshaping Berkshire’s portfolio after the
retirement of Lou Simpson, who had picked stocks at the Geico
unit, and the arrival of Combs, 40. Combs will manage $1 billion
to $3 billion, Buffett said in February. Berkshire held $63.2
billion in equities at the end of March.  “When we issued a press release about Todd’s joining us, a
number of commentators pointed out that he was ‘little-known’
and expressed puzzlement that we didn’t seek a ‘big-name,’”
Buffett wrote in his letter to investors in February. “I wonder
how many of them would have known of Lou in 1979.”  MasterCard advanced 1 percent to $282 at 4:28 p.m. in
extended trading in  New York .  The filing omits information about some transactions
because Buffett was granted temporary permission to keep them
confidential. The Securities and Exchange Commission
sometimes allows companies to withhold data from the public to
limit copycat investing while a firm is building or cutting a
position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
