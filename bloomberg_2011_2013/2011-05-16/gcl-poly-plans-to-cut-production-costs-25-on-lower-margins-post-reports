GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  plans
to cut production costs by 25 percent this year as profit
margins are squeezed by declining prices for its products, the
 South China Morning Post  said, citing Chief Financial Officer
Tong Yee-ming.  The Jiangsu province-based company aims to cut production
costs, excluding raw materials, to 20 cents a watt by year-end
from 27 cents, and cut the cost of making polysilicon to $20 a
kilogram from $22.50, the Hong Kong-based English-language
newspaper reported today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
