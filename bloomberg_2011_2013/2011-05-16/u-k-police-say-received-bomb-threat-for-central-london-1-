Dissident Irish republicans were
likely behind a bomb threat in central London ahead of Queen Elizabeth II’s first visit to Ireland, police said.  The  Metropolitan Police Service  in the U.K. capital said
the threat did not give specifics about time or location and a
spokeswoman wouldn’t comment on reports that the police received
the coded bomb warning on Sunday night.  “We encourage the public to remain vigilant and report any
information about unusual activity or behavior which may be
terrorist-related,” Scotland Yard said today in an e-mailed
statement. Earlier today the police shut the capital’s Mall,
near  Buckingham Palace , and other central London streets.  The threat level from Irish-related terrorism has not
increased and remains at “substantial,” meaning that an attack
is a strong possibility, the police said. The level was raised
in September from “moderate.” That’s lower than the overall
threat to the U.K. from international terrorism which remains at
“severe,” Scotland Yard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
