Mardy Fish  re-entered the top 10 of
the men’s ATP World Tour, putting an American back among the
highest-ranking tennis players after a first-time absence last
week.  Fish moved up one place to No. 10 in the rankings published
today after making it to the round of 16 at the  Rome Masters , a
warm-up for the French Open, which starts May 22 in Paris. Fish
spent one week as the world No. 10 last month. Former top-ranked
Andy Roddick, whose victory at the 2003 U.S. Open makes him the
last American man to win a major, also rose one spot, to No. 11.  Thirteen-time Grand Slam champion  Serena Williams  dropped
out of the top 10 of the women’s WTA Tour last week, meaning
there were no Americans ranked in either elite group for the
first time since the start of the men’s rankings in 1973 and the
women’s in 1975.  Williams is ranked No. 17, after not playing since winning
Wimbledon last July because of a foot injury and treatment for a
blood clot in her lung. Her elder sister Venus fell 10 spots to
No. 29 today. Both sisters last week pulled out of the  French
Open , citing injuries.  Rafael Nadal of  Spain  maintained his No. 1 ranking on the
ATP World Tour, although his lead over second-ranked Novak Djokovic narrowed to 405 points from 1,805 in the previous week.
The Serb beat Nadal the second time in a week on clay to win the
Rome Masters title yesterday, extending his winning streak to 37
straight matches this year.  Denmark’s  Caroline Wozniacki  remained the top female tennis
player.  To contact the reporter on this story:
