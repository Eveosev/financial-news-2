Oil producers need to boost capacity
by 45 million barrels a day, or almost half current output, over
the next 20 years to meet demand and offset field declines, said
Alain Labastie, president of  The Society of Petroleum Engineers .  “The industry is facing a serious challenge of increasing
production capacity and huge efforts are needed to add the
estimated 45 million barrels,” said Labastie, who is also an
engineering adviser for Total SA, said yesterday in Khobar,
 Saudi Arabia .  The world produces about 85 million barrels of crude a day,
Labastie said.  Oil companies  can recover about 1 trillion
barrels by applying better technologies and increasing
production from fields by 45 percent, he said.  “This is a huge amount of oil to be brought to the
market” and needs continuous investment in technology, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
