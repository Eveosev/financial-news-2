IPR Mediterranean Exploration Ltd., a
subsidiary of the Texas-based Improved Petroleum Recovery Group
of Companies, will drill four wells this year in eastern  Syria 
where most recent drilling showed positive indicators.  The company drilled a well in Block 24 and is currently
evaluating the results, state-owned General Petroleum Corp. said
in a statement on its website. IPR Mediterranean Exploration has
produced oil in Syria since 2010 through Al Rasheed Petroleum
Co., a joint venture with the General Petroleum Corp. of Syria,
according to the statement.  Syria is seeking foreign investment to help stabilize crude
output this year at 386,000 barrels a day, Oil Minister Sufian Alao said on March 13. Production peaked at 583,000 barrels a
day in 1996 and the country will deplete existing reserves
within 18 years, according to calculations by BP Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
