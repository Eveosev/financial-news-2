The International Emissions Trading
Association urged the European Union to postpone a vote on a
draft proposal to better protect the bloc’s carbon-registry
system from fraud to June from May.  The EU Climate Change Committee, composed of national
government representatives, is scheduled to vote on May 19 on
the EU common registry  regulation  presented by the European
Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s regulatory arm.  “IETA is content with the level of security envisaged and
welcomes the Commission’s proposal,” it said in a letter to the
commission and member states. “Some modifications are needed in
order to be fully effective and avoid unintended consequences.
We therefore urge the Climate Change Committee to postpone the
vote to the June session.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
