European jet fuel premiums rose for a
second day as Morgan Stanley bought a barge of the  aviation
fuel . Gasoil futures were little changed.  BP Plc bought a naphtha cargo from Glencore International
AG. Gasoline’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , narrowed to the
lowest in a month.  Light Products  Gasoline for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp traded
from $1,045 to $1,050 a metric ton, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. A deal
was also concluded at $1,023 a ton, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring Platts, a pricing service. That
compares with deals on May 13 from $1,052 to $1,065 a ton.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 9,000 tons of the 14,000 tons
that changed hands. Total SA and Northville, a unit of NIC
Holding Corp., were the other buyers. BP and Chevron Corp. were
the principal sellers. The trades are for Eurobob grade to which
ethanol is added to make finished automotive fuel and are
typically for lots of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack shrank to $9.70 a barrel from $11.07 on
May 13, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., an oil and
refined-products broker in  London . That’s the lowest spread
since April 21.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent widened to $4.22 a barrel from
$3.75 on May 13, according to PVM. BP bought a 12,500-ton lot of
naphtha for $979 a ton, priced for delivery to Rotterdam from
May 26 to May 30, according to the survey of Platts. Naphtha is
used in gasoline and petrochemical production.  Middle Distillates  Morgan Stanley purchased a barge of jet fuel from Deutsche
Lufthansa AG at a premium of $89 a ton to June gasoil futures,
according to the survey of the Platts trading window, which ends
at 4:30 p.m. London time. That compares with a May 13 trade at a
$87 premium.  Gasoil futures for June gained 0.2 percent to $918.75 a ton
as of 5:11 p.m. local time on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. Brent for June declined 0.5 percent to $113.31 a barrel.  Gasoil’s premium to Brent, a measure of refining
profitability, shrank to $10.39 a barrel at 4:30 p.m. London
time, compared with $10.47 at that time on May 13, according to
ICE data.  Gasoil barges traded from $4.50 to $7 a ton below June ICE
gasoil, the survey of Platts showed. That’s in line with trades
on May 13.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges changed hands at premiums of
$22 to $24 a ton to June ICE gasoil futures, the survey showed.
That compares with premiums of $23 and $25 above the futures
contract on May 13.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil barges traded from $613 to $616.25 a
ton, the survey showed. The fuel, which contains no more than
3.5 percent sulfur, is used to power ships. It traded from $607
to $608.25 on May 13.  Refineries  Saras SpA’s Sarroch refinery turnaround, which began on
April 4, was “successfully completed” and full production is

Italian refiner, said on a conference call with analysts on May
13, according to a transcript.  To contact the reporter on this story:
