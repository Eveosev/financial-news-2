Naftna Industrija Srbije AD,  Serbia ’s
biggest oil company controlled by OAO Gazprom Neft, said profit
more than tripled in the first quarter as market share and
output rose.  Net income, excluding currency effects, for the first three
months advanced 209 percent to 5.3 billion dinars ($75 million)
from 1.7 billion dinars in the year-ago period, Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Alexey Urusov said today in Belgrade. With the
currency impact, net profit was 9.6 billion dinars, compared
with a loss of 4.5 billion dinars in year-ago quarter.  “A stronger dinar in the first quarter worked well for us,
but the true strength came from increased production,”  Urusov
said at a press conference. Oil alone accounted for 246,000 tons
of output, compared with 193,000 tons a year ago. Production
rose 32.6 percent to 358,000 tons.  Vertically integrated NIS, which also owns and operates
Serbia’s two refineries and a retail network of 480 fuel
stations and warehouses, increased its share of the retail
market to 37 percent from 32 percent a year ago, even as
consumption in the country declined 6.5 percent.  ‘Very Vulnerable’  “We remain very, very vulnerable to currency volatility,”
Urusov said, declining to give a forecast for the rest of the
year.  Chief Executive Officer Kirill Kravchenko said on May 6
that the 2011 result should be “at least” the same level as
2010, when net income reached 16.5 billion dinars.  NIS shares fell 3.22 percent to 571 dinars as of 11.27 a.m.
in Belgrade. The stock, which started trading last August,
reached a record-high 592 dinars on May 13.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 144 percent to 7.8 billion dinars in the first
quarter.  NIS’s debt to banks rose 3.4 percent in the first quarter
from the end of December to $632 million, Urusov said.  The company’s development plan to 2020 envisages increasing
production to 5 million tons of oil equivalent and Ebitda
reaching 130 billion dinars by the end of the decade.  Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s state-controlled gas
producer bought 51 percent of NIS for 400 million euros in early
2009 with a commitment to invest another 500 million euros. It
raised the stake earlier this year to 56.15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
