Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s may have
its power generation and transmission units separated after a
review of its corporate structure, Japan’s Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano said.  “It’s a possible option,” Edano said today when asked at
a media briefing if he agreed with another minister’s comment on
the possible breakup of the utility’s main businesses.  The government shouldn’t block discussions about splitting
Tepco’s generation and transmission operations, National
Strategy Minister  Koichiro Gemba  said yesterday on a TV Asahi
broadcast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
