Jan Kulczyk suspended a plan to build
a coal-fired power plant in Belarus because of difficulty
raising financing for the project, the Polish billionaire told
reporters in Katowice today.  “Such big projects need to be carried out with banks,”
Kulczyk said. “Given the current climate surrounding Belarus it
would be hard to finance such a project.”  Belarus’s foreign-currency reserves hit a 1 1/2-year low in
March and the current-account deficit reached 16 percent of
gross domestic product, prompting President Aleksandr Lukashenko
to look to  Russia  and other partners for a bailout. The former
Soviet republic lifted restrictions on foreign-currency sales to
households May 11 and increased its benchmark interest rate to
14 percent in a bid to bolster the economy and curb a run on the
ruble.  Kulczyk had planned to build a 1,000-megawatt plant in
Zelva, Belarus, for about 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion).  To contact the reporters on this story:
