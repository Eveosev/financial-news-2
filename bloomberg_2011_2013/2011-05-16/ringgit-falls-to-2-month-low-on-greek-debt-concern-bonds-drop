Malaysia ’s ringgit dropped to the
weakest level in almost two months as concern  Greece ’s debt
crisis may worsen sapped demand for emerging-market assets.  European finance ministers meet today to discuss further
support for Greece that may include new loans or an extension of
debt maturities. President  Barack Obama  said failure to raise
the U.S. debt ceiling by early August might disrupt the global
financial system, further weighing on emerging-market currencies.
Bonds declined.  “There is concern the  euro zone  is not seeing a consensus
on rescuing Greece, which will make borrowing costs higher for
other indebted countries,” said D. Sivadass, a currency
forwards trader at EON Capital Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “People
are clearing out of risky assets for now.”  The ringgit declined 1 percent to 3.0396 per dollar as of
4:21 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0435, the lowest level since March 21.
Traders expect the currency to slip 0.3 percent to 3.0502 in
three months, according to non-deliverable forwards contracts.  European officials are working to prevent the euro region’s
first default as Greek ministers plead for terms to be relaxed
on 110 billion euros ($155 billion) of aid from the
 International Monetary Fund  and European Union in a debt crisis
that has also affected Ireland and  Portugal .  A Bank Negara Malaysia report due May 18 will show
Malaysia’s economy grew 4.9 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, compared with 4.8 percent in the three months
through December, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. The central bank forecast growth will be as
high as 6 percent in 2011 versus 7.2 percent last year.  Bond Decline  Malaysia’s three-year government bonds dropped, keeping
yields near a one-week high, as economists forecast inflation
may have accelerated last month at the fastest in two years.  The yield on the 3.434 percent note due August 2014 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.3 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The price dropped 0.03, or 30 sen
per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 100.4.  Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent in April, the most since
April 2009, a separate Bloomberg survey shows before a
statistics department report on May 18. They increased 3 percent
in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
