Citigroup Inc. (C)  appointed Abhay Pande
as head of global banking for industrial companies in Southeast
Asia, as the U.S. bank seeks to boost advisory business from
industries ranging from transport to construction.  Pande, formerly a managing director at Citigroupâ€™s energy
global banking unit in  New York , was also named co-head for
energy global banking in Asia, the company said in a press
release today.  Pande will report to Michael Borch, Asia-Pacific head of
industrials, and Stephen Trauber, Houston-based head of energy
banking, Citigroup said in an e-mailed statement today.  Citigroup last month appointed Tracey Woon as head of
investment banking for Southeast Asia and hired David Kooh from
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc as a managing director in its
financial institutions group, focusing on ASEAN clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
