Germany and  Belgium  said they prefer
having another European as head of the  International Monetary
Fund  if Dominique Strauss-Kahn quits after his arrest on sex-
assault charges.  There are “good reasons” for Europe to keep the IMF post
amid the euro area’s debt crisis, even as the role of developing
nations in IMF matters grows, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
told reporters in Berlin today.  Europe doesn’t have an automatic claim to the post, Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief spokesman, said at a separate news
briefing. “But in the current situation, as dealing with the
crisis in several euro countries puts such demands on the IMF,
there’s a lot to be said for having a good European candidate.”  Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  echoed that
stance, pointing out that an American heads the  World Bank  while
a European is in charge at the IMF.  “It would be preferable if we continued to hold these
posts in the future,” Reynders told reporters in Brussels.
Robert Zoellick, a former U.S. deputy secretary of state, is the
World Bank’s president.  Merkel and her spokesman, citing the pending investigation
by U.S. authorities, declined to comment on Strauss-Kahn’s May
14 arrest in New York on charges he sexually assaulted a
chambermaid at a Manhattan hotel. Strauss-Kahn, 62, denied the
charges, according to his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
