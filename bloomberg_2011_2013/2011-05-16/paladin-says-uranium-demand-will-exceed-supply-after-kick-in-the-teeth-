Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN) , a Perth-based
company producing uranium in  Africa , said the Japan nuclear
crisis has “obscured the positive underlying fundamentals”
in the industry.  Uranium demand is likely to exceed supply, Paladin Chief
Executive Officer John Borshoff said today on a conference call.
While the industry has “taken quite a spectacular kick in the
teeth,” the impact is expected to be “minimal,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
