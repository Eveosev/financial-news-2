Latvia’s central bank bought 12.4
million lati ($24.7 million) for euros last week, the Riga-based
bank said today on its  website .  Latvia, like neighboring  Lithuania , is a member of the pre-
euro exchange-rate mechanism and pegs the lats to  Europe ’s
common currency. Latvia keeps the exchange rate within a 1
percent band around a target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
