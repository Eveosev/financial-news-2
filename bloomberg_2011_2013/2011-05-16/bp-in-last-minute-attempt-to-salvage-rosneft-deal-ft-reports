BP Plc (BP/)  was engaged in last-minute
talks yesterday with its Russian partners in TNK-BP and OAO
Rosneft to try to salvage its proposed deal with OAO Rosneft
before the $16 billion share-swap agreement lapses at midnight
today, the Financial Times reported, citing a person familiar
with the negotiations.  The “conversations” have been “constructive” and
solutions being discussed include the possible buyout of Alfa-
Access-Renova, the vehicle through which BP’s partners in TNK-BP
hold their share, the person said, according to the FT.  A call to BP’s offices outside business hours wasn’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
