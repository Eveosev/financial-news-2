Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said in an e-
mailed statement today that  Earthlife Africa’s  call for a
boycott of its products doesn’t address the issue of  energy
security  in South Africa.  Shell said it is “convinced” it can develop any potential
shale gas resources in South Africa in an “environmentally
responsible and safe way,” and said it respects the
government’s decision to impose a moratorium on license
applications and welcomes the studies it will undertake into the
development of “unconventional gas resources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
