Phoenix Group Holdings (PHNX)  Ltd., the
U.K.’s biggest manager of closed life insurance funds, said it
expects to meet its full-year cashflow target.  Phoenix made 314 million pounds ($508 million) from running
off life insurance policies in the four months through April,
the London-based firm said today in a statement. That compares
with 270 million pounds in the first quarter of 2010. The
company said it’s “on track” to generate between 750 million
pounds and 850 million pounds of cash this year.  “I am confident that we will continue to deliver
throughout the rest of 2011 and meet the challenging targets we
set for the year,” Chief Executive Officer Clive Bannister said
in the statement.  Phoenix, which changed its name from Pearl Group Ltd. in
March, is aiming to pay down its 2.3 billion-pound debt pile by
generating cash from the policies it already owns. The firm
profits by buying life-insurance policies and releasing capital
from them when they mature. The company’s debt surged following
its 5 billion-pound purchase of Resolution Plc in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
