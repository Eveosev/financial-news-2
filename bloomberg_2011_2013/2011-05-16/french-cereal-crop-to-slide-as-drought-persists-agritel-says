France ’s cereal crop, the European
Union’s biggest, will be “in sharp decline” because of drought
that should continue this week, farm adviser Agritel said.  Grain development is “uncommonly precocious” and about
three weeks ahead of normal, Paris-based Agritel said in an e-
mailed report today.  “The water stress of these past weeks is irreversible for
the crops,” said the company, which advises more than 2,000
farmers on crop sales.  France produced 35.6 million metric tons of soft wheat
last year, according to data from crops office FranceAgriMer.  Longer term, price gains stemming from the weather
situation may be limited because of competitive Black Sea
grain, for which the “crop conditions are looking promising,”
Agritel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
