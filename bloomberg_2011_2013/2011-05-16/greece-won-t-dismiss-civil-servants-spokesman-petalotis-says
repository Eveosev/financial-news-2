Greece will refrain from firing civil
servants in its search for spending cuts, said government
spokesman  George Petalotis .  “We’re not discussing sacking permanent employees,” said
Petalotis, according to an e-mailed transcript of comments to
reporters in Athens today. “In any case, there is the
constitution, which, to put a stop to this alarmism that’s
circulating, ensures the permanence of public servants.”  While Greece has cut pensions and wages to reduce a  budget
deficit  that reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product in
2009, it hasn’t fired public employees. Finance ministers in
Brussels today discussed boosting a 110 billion-euro ($156
billion) bailout from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund, pressing Greece to deepen spending cuts to win an
increase in the aid package and more time to repay the loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
