Cash premiums for corn shipped in May
to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago futures
as U.S. farmers held on to supplies. The soybean basis also
increased.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 55 cents to 59 cents a bushel above July futures, up
from 55 cents to 58 cents on May 13, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis rose to 60 cents to 71
cents a bushel, up from 60 cents to 70 cents.  “There’s not a lot of corn, and the people who have it
aren’t rushing to sell it,” said  Glenn Hollander , a partner at
Chicago-based Hollander & Feuerhaken, a cash trader and futures
broker. “There’s a tightness in the cash markets, and it’s
starting to be reflected in the spreads and the basis.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 15.5 cents, or 2.3
percent, to settle at $6.975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest jump since May 9. The grain has climbed 92
percent in the past 12 months.  Soybean futures for July delivery fell 3 cents, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $13.265 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
