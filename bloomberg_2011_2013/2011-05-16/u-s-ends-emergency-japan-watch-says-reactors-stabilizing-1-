The U.S.  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  will end its emergency 24-hour monitoring of the
reactor crisis in  Japan  because the situation is “slowly
stabilizing,” the agency said.  “As conditions have continued to improve and the Japanese
continue to implement their recovery plan, the NRC has
determined that it is time to adjust our response,” Bill Borchardt, the NRC’s executive director for operations, said
today in a statement on the agency’s website. The NRC still has
staff working in Japan, according to the statement.  A March 11 earthquake and tsunami destroyed  power lines  and
flooded diesel generators at Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, depriving its cooling systems of
electricity. Fuel rods in four of the plant’s six reactor
buildings overheated, causing fires, explosions and radiation
leaks in the world’s worst nuclear incident since the 1986
Chernobyl disaster.  The Rockville, Maryland-based regulator, which set up a
operations center when the disaster began, “is now operating in
its usual manner,” Scott Burnell, a spokesman, said in an e-
mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
