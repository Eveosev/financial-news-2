The Turkish lira gained, rebounding
from the weakest close in two months against the dollar, and
stocks climbed after reports showed  consumer confidence 
increased and unemployment declined. Bond yields rose.  The lira strengthened 0.6 percent to 1.5873 against the
dollar at 5:32 p.m. in Istanbul, reducing this year’s loss to
2.7 percent, the second-worst performance after  South Africa ’s
rand among more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  of equities increased 1.3
percent to 65,417.92.  Consumer confidence rose to 93.46 in April from 93.43 a
month earlier, the statistics office in Ankara said on its
website today. The jobless rate fell to 11.5 percent in
February, declining for the first time in three months,
according to the office.  “Households are selling dollar savings because of the
level the lira has reached,” Eren Yardimci, a currency trader
at Akbank TAS, said by telephone. “Clients are selling foreign
-exchange because they think it will be difficult for the lira
to break 1.6 level per dollar,” said Yardimci.  Total foreign-exchange deposits  held in the Turkish banks
were $118.2 billion as of April 29 with $70.1 billion held in
the dollar, the central bank showed on its website.  “The lira’s appreciation today may be a temporary short-
covering but I still do not think levels above 1.6 can last
long,” Emre Balkeser, head of trading at Garanti Yatirim, said
in e-mailed comments.  Two-year benchmark bond yields increased 12 basis points to
8.86 percent, the highest level in six weeks, according to the
TEB Local Benchmark Bond Index. The  Finance Ministry  said today
 Turkey  had a budget surplus of 1.1 billion liras ($693 million)
in April as  tax revenue  grew.  “The figures are negative in the sense that they show
domestic demand is not slowing and signals necessity of new
steps from the central bank,” Fatih Keresteci, a strategist at
the Istanbul-based unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, said in a note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
