Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo
said that the global economy still faces an “uncertain” growth
path, due to the persistent fiscal woes in Europe and volatile
 oil prices .  The March 11 earthquake in Japan may disrupt supply chains
for raw materials and parts, affecting industrial production in
other countries, Kim said in prepared remarks to be delivered
today at a seminar in Chuncheon, north of  Seoul . He also said
high inflation pressures will likely persist for some time,
fueled by an economic recovery and rising commodity prices.  The central bank last week unexpectedly kept  interest rates 
unchanged at 3 percent after two increases this year, opting to
judge whether gains in the won will contribute to a slowdown in
inflation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
