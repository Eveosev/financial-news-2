The forint strengthened after its
biggest drop in almost two months as the central bank kept the
benchmark interest rate unchanged.  The forint strengthened 0.3 percent to 267.92 per euro by
3:18 p.m. in Budapest, after weakening 0.9 percent on May 13 in
the biggest daily drop since March 15. The BUX index of shares
declined 1.1 percent to 23,080.86.  Government bonds  due in 2020
strengthened, pushing the yield down four basis points to 7.16
percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank left the two-week deposit rate at 6
percent after a unanimous vote, central bank President Andras
Simor told reporters today. That matched the estimate of all 14
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “We doubt that the central bank can maintain this line
over the coming months with inflation remaining elevated.”
analysts at BNP Paribas SA led by Paul Mortimer-Lee in  London 
wrote in a research report today.  The April inflation rate rose to 4.7 percent from 4.5
percent in March, equaling the December rate, which was the
highest since June, the statistics office in Budapest said on
May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
