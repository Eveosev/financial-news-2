The U.S. Supreme Court gave a partial
victory to  Cigna Corp. (CI)  in a pension fight, setting aside a
ruling that required the company to recalculate the benefits for
27,000 workers.  The dispute stemmed from Cigna’s 1998 conversion of its
 pension plan  into a so-called cash balance plan. The workers
said they didn’t realize at the time that most of them would
lose money as a result of the conversion. Two lower courts said
workers were entitled to additional benefits.  The Supreme Court today unanimously set aside those
rulings, saying the workers needed to show that they were harmed
by Cigna’s violation of a federal employee-benefits law.  The justices stopped short of requiring the workers to show
that they relied on plan summaries that a trial judge concluded
were misleading.  Cigna in 2008 took a pretax charge of $80 million to cover
its estimated liabilities in the case.  Cash balance plans are hybrids that combine elements of
traditional employer-funded defined-benefit plans with the
transferable personal accounts that are common to 401(k)-style
defined-contribution plans.  The case is Cigna v. Amara, 09-804.  To contact the reporter on this story:
