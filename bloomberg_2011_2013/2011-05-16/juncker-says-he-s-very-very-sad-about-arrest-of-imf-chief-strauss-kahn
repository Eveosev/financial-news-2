Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker said
he was “very, very sad” about the arrest in  New York  of
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-
Kahn on sexual-assault charges.  “To see  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  in handcuffs on television
this morning has deeply saddened me,” Juncker told reporters in
Brussels late yesterday after leading a meeting of European
finance ministers. “I have the feeling to be in a bad movie.”  A Manhattan judge yesterday ordered Strauss-Kahn held
without bail, two days after he was pulled off an Air France
flight as it prepared to leave  John F. Kennedy International
Airport . Strauss-Kahn, accused of sexually assaulting and
attempting to rape a hotel housekeeper, has denied the
accusations and will plead not guilty, his lawyer said.  “I didn’t like the pictures I saw on the TV this
morning,” Juncker said. “It was deeply sad and traumatic.”  Juncker said ministers didn’t discuss Strauss-Kahn during
their talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
