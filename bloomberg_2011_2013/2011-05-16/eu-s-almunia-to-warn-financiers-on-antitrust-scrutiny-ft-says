EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  will tell bankers and financial services operators that
the European Union is planning to introduce stringent antitrust
monitoring along with tougher regulation, the Financial Times
reported, citing a speech by Almunia to be delivered today to a
seminar in  London .  Almunia will say regulation is “not enough” and damaging
behavior by individual participants in wholesale markets will
need to be tackled with competition policy, the FT said. He will
warn operators against collusion among companies and using
“undue influence,” the newspaper said, citing the speech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
