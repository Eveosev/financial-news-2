Day trader Daniel Corbin, charged
last year with  insider trading  and  securities fraud , is
scheduled to plead guilty in  Manhattan  federal court today, a
court clerk said.  Corbin was one of five people indicted in December 2008 on
securities fraud and conspiracy charges and accused of making
illegal trades based on confidential tips gleaned from the wife
of an ex-Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. salesman. Corbin was
indicted on additional counts of insider trading in April 2010.  U.S. prosecutors said the salesman, Matthew Devlin, passed
on tips gleaned from his wife, a Brunswick Group public-
relations executive who was involved with corporate deals. She
wasn’t accused of wrongdoing.  A plea by Corbin, scheduled before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Henry Pitman, would make him the last of the five people named
in the indictment to plead guilty. Devlin admitted to his role
in the scheme in December 2008 and agreed to cooperate with
prosecutors, according to a court document.  The three other people named in the indictment pleaded
guilty in May 2009: former Lehman salesman Frederick Bowers;
Eric Holzer, a tax lawyer who worked at Paul Hastings Janofsky &
Walker LLP; and Jamil Bouchareb, another day trader. Bowers and
Holzer were both sentenced to probation, and Bouchareb is
scheduled to be sentenced in July.  Ronald Gainor, an attorney representing Corbin, didn’t
immediately respond to a voice-mail message left on his mobile
phone seeking comment.  The case is U.S. v. Corbin, 09-cr-00463, U.S. District
Judge, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
