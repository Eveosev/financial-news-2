The U.K. government is considering
allowing both parents to share as much as 30 weeks of leave
between them after a child is born, as well as giving all
employees the right to request flexible working hours.  Fathers are currently allowed two weeks of paid leave on
the birth of a child, while mothers are entitled to six weeks on
90 percent of their pay, 33 weeks on statutory maternity pay of
124.88 pounds ($202) a week, and the right to 52 weeks off work.  A consultation paper  published today suggested that from
2015, mothers should be entitled to 18 weeks paid leave in a
single block around the birth, with a further four paid weeks
for each parent, and then 30 weeks of leave that can be shared
between the pair. Of those 30, 17 would be paid.  “New parents should be able to choose their child-care
arrangements for themselves, rather than being dictated by rigid
 government regulation  as is currently the case,” Business
Secretary Vince Cable told reporters in London. “We will ensure
that businesses will still be able to take into account their
needs when agreeing how leave can be taken.”  Other proposals include allowing all staff to request
flexible hours and requiring companies found guilty of sexual
discrimination to undergo an equal-pay audit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
