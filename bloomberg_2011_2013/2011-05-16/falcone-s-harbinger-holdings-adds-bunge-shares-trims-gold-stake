Harbinger Holdings LLC, the hedge
fund run by Philip Falcone, bought shares of food company  Bunge
Ltd. (BG)  in the first quarter and sold shares of SPDR Gold Trust,
according to a regulatory filing.  Harbinger’s holdings of U.S. stocks declined to $1.1
billion from $1.6 billion in stocks at the end of 2010,
according to today’s filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  The firm, based in New York, acquired 270,230 shares,
valued at about $20 million, of White Plains, New York-based
Bunge.  Falcone’s fund, which manages about $6 billion in assets,
reduced its holding in the SPDR Gold Trust exchange-traded fund
by almost half to 145,000 shares from 280,000 shares. That
position was valued at almost $39 million at the end of 2010.  Steve Bruce , a spokesman for Harbinger, declined to
