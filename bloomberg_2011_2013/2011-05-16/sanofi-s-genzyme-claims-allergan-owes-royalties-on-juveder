Sanofi-Aventis SA (SAN) ’s Genzyme unit sued
Allergan Inc. for patent royalties on sales of wrinkle filler
Juvederm.  Genzyme, which has a patent for a gel used to augment soft
tissue, claims Irvine, California-based Allergan has refused to
make payments for sales of Juvederm Ultra, Ultra Plus, Ultra XC
and Ultra Plus XC. Genzyme is demanding compensation and an
order blocking further use of its invention without permission,
according to the complaint today in federal court in Boston.  Allergan, which also makes the Botox treatment, had been
paying Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Genzyme on a patent that
expired in July 2010, according to the complaint. Genzyme sued
because Allergan declined a request to continue paying the same
royalties through the March 2012 expiration of a second patent.  Allergan is reviewing the complaint and has no comment,
said Caroline Van Hove, a spokeswoman for the company.  Juvederm is an injection to fill in wrinkles around the
nose and mouth. Allergan doesn’t break out sales of the product.  Paris-based Sanofi,  France ’s biggest drugmaker, bought
Genzyme last month for about $20 billion.  The case is Genzyme Corp. v. Allergan Inc., 11cv10868, U.S.
District Court for the District of  Massachusetts  (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
