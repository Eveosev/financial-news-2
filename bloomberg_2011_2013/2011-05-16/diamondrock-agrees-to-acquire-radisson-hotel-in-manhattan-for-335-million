DiamondRock Hospitality Co. (DRH) , a real
estate investment trust that owns hotels operated by Marriott
International Inc., agreed to buy the 712-room Radisson
Lexington Hotel  New York  in midtown Manhattan for $335 million.  The property, on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 48th
Street, is likely to produce $198 of revenue per available room
this year, the Bethesda, Maryland-based company said in a
statement today. That is 70 percent above the DiamondRock
portfolio average for revpar, a measure of rates and occupancy
used by hoteliers, the REIT said.  New York City hotel sales probably will double to as much
as $2.4 billion this year as Manhattan is the most active U.S.
market for lodging transactions, Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels said
in February.  DiamondRock, which expects to complete the acquisition
within 30 days, said it will keep Highgate Hotels as the
propertyâ€™s operator and is considering whether to retain the
Radisson flag for the hotel. The seller is a joint venture of
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) , Highgate Holdings Inc.,  Chartres Lodging
Group LLC  and  Oxford Capital Group LLC , according to New York-
based property-research company  Real Capital Analytics Inc.   To contact the reporter on this story:
