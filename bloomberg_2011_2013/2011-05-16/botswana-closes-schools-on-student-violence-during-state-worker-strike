Botswana closed all state schools
because of fighting by students during a strike by civil
servants, said Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, the minister of
education.  The decision follows reports of violence at schools, both
among pupils and against police, in various parts of the
country, Venson-Moitoi said in an e-mailed statement today from
Gaborone, the capital.  State workers started a fifth week of a strike over pay,
leaving schools with less staff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
