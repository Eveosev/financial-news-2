The Group of Eight leading economies
is covering up its failure to meet aid targets the Financial
Times reported, citing a leaked draft of the G8’s accountability
report, prepared for this month’s summit in Deauville,  France .  The report claims to have raised annual aid by almost $49
billion between 2004 and 2010, just $1 billion a year short of
the target set at a 2005 summit, the FT said. The Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development, however, calculated
that development aid in 2010 was $19 billion less than the 2005
targets, the newspaper said. noting that the discrepancy is due
the G8 not allowing for inflation in its accounting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
