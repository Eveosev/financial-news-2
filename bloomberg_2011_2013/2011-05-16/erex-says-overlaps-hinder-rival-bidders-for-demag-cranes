Terex Corp. (TEX)  Chief Executive Officer
 Ron DeFeo  said the heavy-equipment maker doesn’t expect
competition in its 883.9 million-euro ($1.25 billion) bid for
 Germany ’s  Demag Cranes AG (D9C)  because potential suitors would face
“significant overlaps.”  “All bidders in my opinion have an issue or two, whether
that’s regulator risk or cultural issues,” DeFeo said today in
an interview in New York, where Westport, Connecticut-based
Terex was holding a presentation for investors.  “Each one of the competitors has significant overlaps
where we don’t,” he said. “Overlaps mean either jobs get lost
or regulator risk.”  Terex, which makes construction cranes, on May 2 offered
41.75 a share for Dusseldorf-based Demag to expand into harbor
cranes. Demag has traded above the bid price since then, closing
at 47.50 euros today in Frankfurt trading.  “The price that their equity is trading at is assuming
that there will be a competing bid and a competitive bid
process,” DeFeo said. “I think that’s a bad assumption but
it’s an assumption that only time will determine.”  Demag hasn’t responded to Terex’s offer, DeFeo said.  “If management can’t talk with us then I think their
shareholders are going to have to make their own decision,” he
said.  Terex fell $1.26, or 4 percent, to $30.04 as of 4:15 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.  Terex’s offer for Demag is the largest takeover involving a
material-handling company announced in the past 10 years,
according to data on 115 bids compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
