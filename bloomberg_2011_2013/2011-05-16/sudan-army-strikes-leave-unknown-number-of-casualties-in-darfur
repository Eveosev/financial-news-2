Air strikes by the Sudanese army on
villages in the western region of Darfur yesterday left an
unknown number of casualties, the  United Nations and African
Union peacekeeping mission  said today.  The attacks took place on the villages of Labado and
Esheraya in South Darfur state, the mission said in an e-mailed
statement. A team will be sent to the villages to determine the
number of injured, it said.  “There’s a very real concern that civilians may be among
the casualties,” Chris Cycmanick, a spokesman for the mission,
said by phone from El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state.  The Sudanese army said it carried out a reconnaissance
mission in the area on May 14 to see the location of rebels from
the  Justice and Equality Movement  and that it did not attack the
villages or the rebels.  The army is chasing JEM fighters who
have been making “suspicious movements” in the area, army
spokesman Al-Sawarmi Khaled said today by phone from Khartoum,
the Sudanese capital.  Insurgents in Darfur took up arms in 2003, accusing the
government of neglecting the region. The conflict has led to the
deaths of as many as 300,000 people, mainly due to illness and
starvation, and forced about 2.7 million to flee their homes,
according to UN estimates. The Sudanese government has put the
death toll at about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
