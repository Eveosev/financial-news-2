Commercial property prices in the
U.K. rose at a slower pace in April after public spending cuts
deterred companies from renting additional space, Investment
Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average values of offices, stores and warehouses
increased 2.7 percent from a year earlier, the London-based
research company said today on its website. That compares with a
3.5 percent gain in March.  Real-estate values are 35 percent below their peak in June
2007, IPD said. The total return, including price gains and
rental income, was 0.7 percent in April compared with 0.9
percent the previous month.  “It looks like the wider macro-economic factors affecting
the economy, notably the government spending cuts, are beginning
to take their toll on occupier demand,” Phil Tily, the managing
director of U.K. and Ireland at IPD, said in an e-mail.  The monthly index was compiled from 3,646 properties valued
at 33.8 billion pounds ($55 billion) at the end of April, IPD
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
