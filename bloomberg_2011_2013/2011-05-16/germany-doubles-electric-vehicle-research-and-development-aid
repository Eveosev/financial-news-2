The German government announced an
additional 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in research and
development aid for electric vehicles, doubling its budget by
2013 in a bid to position itself at the technology’s vanguard.  Tax rebates, dedicated parking spots and measures aimed at
promoting government use of electric cars are among the other
incentives to be adopted as Germany strives to meet a target of
1 million such vehicles on the streets by 2020,  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  told reporters in Berlin today.  “We’re going to see these vehicles come in very quickly,”
though “the really broad market debut will still take a couple
of years,” Merkel said. “I’m certain that German producers
will be in the fray at the right time.”  Germany is banking on electric vehicles as it seeks to
ensure the future dominance of carmakers including  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) ,  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. (BMW)  Merkel’s Cabinet
will back a progress report on measures to speed the development
of electric cars when it meets in Berlin tomorrow, she said.  Merkel, in a  weekly podcast  posted on her website two days
ago, said that the construction of batteries and the necessary
infrastructure to enable them to be charged were the two biggest
challenges to the development of electric vehicles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
