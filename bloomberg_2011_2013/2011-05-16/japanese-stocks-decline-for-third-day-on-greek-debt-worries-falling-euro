Japanese stocks fell for a third day
as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its rating on the country’s
equities and on concern  Greece  may have to restructure its debt,
hampering the global economic recovery.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker, slid 1.8
percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  lost 1.6 percent,
leading the nation’s lenders down after Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services cut credit ratings for  Tokyo Electric  Power Co.,
the owner of a damaged power plant. Ricoh Co., an office
equipment maker that gets almost a quarter of its sales from
 Europe , declined 1.1 percent after the euro weakened. Credit
Saison Co., a consumer lender, sank 6 percent after saying
profit fell short of its outlook due to a quake-related charge.  “Investors are avoiding putting money on risk assets,
strengthening the yen and weighing on the stock market,” said
 Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion in  Tokyo  at Shinkin
Asset Management Co. “Uncertainty about compensation from the
nuclear disaster and concern about the Japanese government’s
credibility may be weighing down the market.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.9 percent to 9,558.30
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix lost 1.2 percent to
829.55, with four times as many shares declining as advancing.  The Topix has tumbled 11 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant and disrupted
supply chains at companies.  Tepco Tumbles  Tokyo Electric, the operator of the nuclear power plant
crippled by the temblor, tumbled 7.3 percent to 420 yen, the
biggest drop in the  Nikkei 225. (NKY)  S&P said on May 13 it lowered to
BBB from BBB+ its long-term corporate credit and debt ratings on
the utility. Also, Tepco said on May 15 that fuel in the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi No. 1 reactor melted at an early stage after
the March 11 tsunami that caused widespread damage to Japan’s
northeastern coast.  Contracts protecting debt of Tokyo Electric, or Tepco,
from default jumped 145.4 basis points to 357.8 basis points on
May 13, the biggest increase since March 15 and the highest
level since April 19, according to data provider CMA, which
compiles prices quoted in the privately-negotiated market.  Moody’s Japan K.K. said in a report “forgiving Tepco’s
prior bank loans would be credit negative for lenders.”
Comments stated by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano last week
made financial institutions and the market unstable, Moody’s
said.  Banks Drop  “People won’t support” using public funds for Tepco
unless banks waive some loans made before the March 11
earthquake and tsunami crippled its Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant, Edano said on May 13 in Tokyo.  Mitsubishi UFJ fell 1.6 percent to 377 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-largest bank by market
value, retreated 2.1 percent 2,401 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui posted a
loss in the fourth quarter after the record earthquake and said
profit will drop 16 percent this year on higher costs for bad
loans.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.8 percent to
1,337.77 on May 13 in  New York  as CA Inc., the second-largest
maker of software for  mainframe computers , led technology shares
lower after earnings missed estimates and banks slid amid
concern about Europe’s debt crisis.  Automakers were the biggest contributor to the Topix’s drop
among its 33 industry groups, followed by banks. Toyota slumped
1.8 percent to 3,340 yen and smaller rival Nissan Motor Co., a
carmaker that gets more than three quarters of its sales
overseas, fell 2.4 percent to 803 yen.  Weaker Euro  The euro fell against all but two of its 16 most-traded
counterparts on concern Greece may have to restructure its debt
and the nation’s problems may spread in the region. The shared
currency slipped to as much as 113.42 yen today in Tokyo,
compared with 114.79 yen at the close of  stock trading  on May 13,
cutting the value of European income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  Ricoh fell 1.1 percent to 849 yen and  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronic components maker that gets 20 percent of its revenue
from Europe, declined 1.3 percent to 8,510 yen.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said extending
the maturities of Greek bonds may be a way to help ease the
country’s debt crisis if private investors participate. While
it’s too early to say whether more help is needed, “extra
measures” may be needed if Greece can’t return to financial
markets next year as planned under the European-led aid program
agreed in 2010, Schaeuble said in an interview with ARD
 television  in Berlin yesterday.  Brussels Talks  As euro-area finance ministers prepare to discuss the
resurgence of the Greek debt crisis in Brussels on May 16,
Schaeuble pressed the government to do its part and stay the
course on its pledge of finding 50 billion euros ($70.6 billion)
in privatization revenue.  Japan ’s equities were downgraded to “underweight” at
Goldman Sachs, which cited “greater cautiousness” on U.S.
growth and domestic risks such as electricity supply and yen
strength.  Of the 1,500 companies in the Topix index that have
reported earnings results since April 1, 232 have exceeded
analysts’ estimates, while 266 have missed them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Financial services companies had the second-biggest decline
in the Topix, following utilities.  Credit Saison tumbled 6 percent to 1,235 yen. The company
said on May 13 that full-year net income fell 31 percent to 12.8
billion yen ($158 million), short of its forecast by 22 percent,
as it took a quake-related charge.  Promise Co., Japan’s No. 2 consumer lender by market value,
plunged 11 percent to 639 yen after swinging to a net loss of 96
billion yen from a year-earlier profit, with falling revenue and
more reserves needed to repay overcharged interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
