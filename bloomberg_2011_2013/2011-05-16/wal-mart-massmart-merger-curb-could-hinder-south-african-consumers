The majority of consumers would be at
a disadvantage if South Africa’s anti-trust authorities imposed
any conditions on  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s purchase of a majority
stake in  Massmart Holdings Ltd (MSM) , according to David Unterhalter,
senior counsel for both companies.  “There are benefits to the many in the merger and if there
were to be any conditions those gains would be lost to South
Africa,” Unterhalter said in his closing arguments into the
proposed transaction at the Pretoria-based Competition Tribunal
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
