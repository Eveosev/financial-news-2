John Allen, a former chief operating
officer of the  Cincinnati Reds , will assist Tom Schieffer in
Major League Baseball’s monitoring of the daily operations of
the  Los Angeles Dodgers .  Allen was selected today to help direct the club’s day-to-
day operations, business and finances, MLB said in a news
release. Allen’s appointment comes a week after Dick Freeman, a
former executive with the Pittsburgh Pirates and  San Diego
Padres , was hired and removed as Schieffer’s assistant because
of a potential pre-existing conflict with  Frank McCourt , the
Dodgers’ owner, and Jamie McCourt, his ex-wife who says she is
part-owner of the team.  Allen joined the Reds in 1995 and served as the team’s COO
from 1999 to 2007. In that time he oversaw the development and
construction of Great American Ball Park, which opened in 2003.  Schieffer was appointed to monitor position on April 25, a
week after Commissioner Bud Selig announced that MLB would
control management of the Dodgers because of “deep concerns
regarding the finances and operations” of the team. The Dodgers
are 19-20, in third place in the National League West division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
