Serbian politicians should commit to
fiscal rules and avoid ballooning spending in a pre-election
year, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Serbia  can’t afford to offer the nation “a shortcut to
higher living standards through unrealistic fiscal promises,
particularly by promising higher-than-sustainable public wages
and pensions, or too low taxes,” two IMF officials said today
in a commentary. “The fiscal cost of a typical pre-election
year in Serbia was about 3 percent of GDP” over the past
decade, they said, offering their own estimates.  “To shield Serbia’s fiscal responsibility rules from the
likely heat of upcoming pre-election politics and promises, one
fresh idea to think about could be for the main political
parties to pledge publicly to respect new fiscal responsibility
rules,” chief of IMF mission to Serbia Albert Jaeger and IMF
resident representative Bogdan Lissovolik said in an article
also published today in Belgrade newspaper  Novosti .  Serbia adopted fiscal responsibility rules in 2010, capping
the public debt-to-GDP ratio at 45 percent of GDP, while the
fiscal gap should be cut to 1 percent of GDP in the medium term,
to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.  General elections are due by spring 2012 and the coalition
government of Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  is eager to boost
 living standards  and create new jobs in a country of 7.5 million
people, where less than 1.8 million people are officially
employed and the  unemployment rate  is 20 percent.  Serbia’s income levels are only about half the levels in
eastern  Europe , while the country exports only 25 percent of its
production, Jaeger and Lissovolik said in the article published
just days before an IMF mission arrives in Belgrade to discuss a
new, precautionary agreement with the Balkan country.  Serbia completed a 3 billion-euro ($4.3 billion) IMF
bailout program by which it must keep its 2011 fiscal gap under
4.1 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
