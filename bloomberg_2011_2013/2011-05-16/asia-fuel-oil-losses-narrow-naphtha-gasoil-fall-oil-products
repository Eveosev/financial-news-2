Asia naphtha fell for the third day.
 Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed to the lowest in two
months, signaling reduced losses for refiners turning oil into
residual products.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil fell $3.25, or 0.5
percent, to $640 a metric ton today, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used
as marine fuel, slipped $3.50, or 0.6 percent, to $628.50 a ton.  There were no deals reported on the pricing system operated
by Platts, traders said.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai narrowed $1.44, or 15 percent,
to $8.04 a barrel, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
London-based crude and refined-products broker. The premium of
180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke fuel oil dropped $1 to
$11.50 a barrel, PVM data showed.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  fell
$8.75, or 0.9 percent, to $975.75 a metric ton today, Bloomberg
data showed. The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to  Brent
crude  traded in  London , or the crack spread, was little changed
at $127.95 a ton from $127.43 at the end of Asian trading on May
13.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline declined 1.7 percent to $118.85 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha fell $1 today to $12.40 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. A narrower reforming margin
indicates it’s less profitable to turn naphtha into gasoline
compared with last week.  In Singapore, Total SA sold 50,000 barrels of 97-RON
gasoline for loading June 2 to June 6 to Royal Dutch Shell Plc
at $125 a barrel, traders said. Noble Group sold 50,000 barrels
of 92-RON for May 31 to June 4 loading to Vitol Group at $118.90
a barrel.  Shell bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-half July
delivery from Glencore International AG at $976 a ton.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s biggest state-owned oil
company, will begin contract talks with Asian buyers next week
for naphtha supplies in the second half of this year, according
to three people familiar with the plan.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, with 0.5 percent sulfur, fell $1.15, or 0.9
percent, to $124 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Jet fuel
dropped $1.15, or 0.9 percent, to $125.65 a barrel.  In  Singapore , Hin Leong Trading Pte bought 170,000 barrels
of gasoil, with sulfur content of 0.5 percent, from Shell at
parity to benchmark prices published by Platts. The cargo was
for loading from May 31 to June 4.  Hin Leong sold 230,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent
sulfur for loading June 2 to June 6 to Total at a premium of 10
cents above benchmark prices.  Winson Oil sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10 parts-
per-million of sulfur for loading May 31 to June 4 to Shell at a
premium of $2.40 a barrel over prices of the 0.5 percent sulfur
grade published by Platts.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude dropped 39
cents to $17.47 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. This crack
spread, a measure of refining profit, is at the lowest since May
11.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade, was unchanged
at $1.80 a barrel, data from PVM showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
