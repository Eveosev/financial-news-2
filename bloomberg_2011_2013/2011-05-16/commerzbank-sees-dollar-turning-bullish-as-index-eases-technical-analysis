The Dollar Index is approaching a
level that may signal an end to the declining trend for the U.S.
currency, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  IntercontinentalExchange’s Dollar Index, which tracks the
greenback against the currencies of six major trading partners
including the euro, could signal a bullish trend should it break
above a so-called channel resistance level of 77.01, according
to the bank. The index rose 1.30 percent from a week ago to
75.71 as of 9:30 a.m. in London today.  “The 77.01 is a key level to watch, as a rise above that
may signal that the bearish trend is over,” said  Axel Rudolph ,
a senior technical analyst at Commerzbank. “If the level is
overcome, the next to watch would be 78.33, which represents a
200-day moving average.”  A moving average is an indicator that displays the average
value of a security’s price over a period of time. A close above
the level suggests the asset may be on the rise.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. A resistance level on a
chart is where technical analysts expect orders to sell a
currency and its related securities. Support is where buy orders
may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
