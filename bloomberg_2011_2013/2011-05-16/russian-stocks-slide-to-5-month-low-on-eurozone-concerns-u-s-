Russia ’s Micex Index sank to its
lowest in more than five months as oil fell the first day in
three and copper declined, dragging commodity producers lower.  The 30-stock Micex dropped 1.4 percent 1,609.53 by 2 p.m.
in Moscow, headed for its worst close since Dec. 1. OAO Lukoil,
Russia’s second-biggest oil producer, slid 1.7 percent while OAO
Gazprom, the country’s gas export monopoly, slipped 2.1 percent.
OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, Russia’s biggest miner, slipped 1.8
percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index decreased 2 percent to
1,829.39.  Oil, Russia’s chief export revenue earner, slid as much as
$1.98 to $97.67 a barrel in  New York  after President Barack
Obama said failure to raise the U.S. debt ceiling may unravel
global finances and threaten growth in the world’s biggest crude
consumer.  Greece  will plead for a boost today in its 110
billion-euro ($155 billion) financial lifeline from European
governments and the  International Monetary Fund .  “Investors remain wary over Eurozone debt and growth
prospects as  interest rates  climb in many countries,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib Securities, said in an e-
mailed report today.  Copper for three-month delivery fell as much as 0.8 percent
to $8,715 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. All main
metals quoted on the LME dropped, led by tin, nickel and zinc.  Russian stocks have plunged 11.2 percent so far this
quarter as global oil and metal prices retreated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
