The United Arab Emirates military
trains with third-party security forces, including Reflex
Responses, or R2, founded by former Navy SEAL commando Erik
Prince, a government official said today.  “The U.A.E. armed forces currently engage with a number of
third parties, such as Spectre, which delivers academy training
capabilities; Horizon, a pilot training partner and R2 which
provides operational, planning and training support,” General
Juma Khalaf al-Hamiri, head of administration and human
resources for the Armed Forces said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. “All engagements of commercial entities by the
U.A.E. Armed Forces are compliant with international Law and
relevant conventions.”  The New York Times  reported yesterday  that the U.A.E.
government paid $529 million to R2 to form a battalion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
