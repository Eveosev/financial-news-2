European Union carbon permits fell,
extending last week’s losses, as German electricity and U.K.
natural-gas contracts slid, curbing demand.  EU carbon permits for December lost 5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to 16.67 euros ($23.53) a metric ton as of 10:30 a.m.
on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  Permits dropped 1.9 percent last week, the biggest decline
since the week ended March 25, as the  Czech Republic  said it
would hand out the maximum number of free allowances to power
utilities starting 2013, limiting market demand.  Power for next-year in  Germany , Europe’s biggest power
user, fell 0.7 percent to 58.70 euros a megawatt-hour, broker
prices on Bloomberg show. Lower prices can deter utilities from
selling power in advance and reduce the purchase of permits
associated with those sales.  Natural gas for delivery into the U.K. this winter, the six
months from October, slipped 0.7 percent to 68.4 pence a therm.
Lower gas prices can trigger utilities to switch to burning the
fuel. Gas emits about half the emissions of coal in power
generation.  European factories and power stations can use a portion of
United Nations offsets to comply with emissions limits. The
premium of EU permits over UN offsets for 2011, traded as a
separate contract, narrowed by 1 percent to 4.01 euros a metric
ton. That’s the smallest spread since May 5, exchange data on
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
