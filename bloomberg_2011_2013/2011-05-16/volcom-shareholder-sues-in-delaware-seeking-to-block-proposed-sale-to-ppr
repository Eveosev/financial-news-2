Volcom Inc. was sued over claims its
planned $607.5 million sale to  PPR (PP)  SA, the French owner of Gucci
and Puma, is unfair and coercive to shareholders.  The proposed agreement is “grossly inadequate,”
shareholder Gabriel Graff said in a complaint filed in Delaware
Chancery Court. PPR said May 2 it would pay $24.50 a share for
 Costa Mesa , California-based Volcom to strengthen its lifestyle-
sports unit with skate and snowboarding gear.  “Despite the company’s recent financial success, Volcom is
trying to sell itself off to PPR,” Graff said in the complaint
made public today. Graff seeks to represent all Volcom
shareholders in the bid to block to deal.  The offer by Paris-based PPR values Volcom at 24 percent
more than its April 29 closing price of $19.73. Graff accused
Volcom directors of acting for their own benefit by agreeing to
a deal with strict protections.  “These preclusive deal protection devices illegally
restrain the company’s ability to solicit or engage in
negotiations with any third party,” Graff said.  Rob Whetstone, a spokesman for Volcom, had no immediate
comment on the lawsuit.  Volcom, founded in 1991, reported 2010 net income of $22.3
million on sales of $323.2 million, with two-thirds of sales
coming in the U.S.  Volcom fell 2 cents to $24.43 at 11:41 a.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. PPR rose 20 cents to 122.05
euros in Paris trading.  The case is Graff v.  Volcom Inc. (VLCM) , CA6487, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
