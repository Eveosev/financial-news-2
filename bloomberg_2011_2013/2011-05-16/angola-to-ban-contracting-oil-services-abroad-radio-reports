Angola plans to ban foreign  oil
companies  from contracting services from companies abroad, Radio
Nacional de Angola said, citing Manuel Vicente, chairman of the
state-owned oil company Sonangol EP.  Sonangol, which manages the countryâ€™s oil concessions
process, will stop companies from holding tenders overseas so
that only domestic firms take part, the Luanda-based radio
reported.  Angola vies with  Nigeria  as Africa biggest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
