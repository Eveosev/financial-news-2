Coal exports from Mongoliaâ€™s Tavan
Tolgoi mine to  China  have resumed, the official Xinhua news
agency reported via COMTEX today, citing local media reports.  Mongolia suspended exports on April 20 because of the
environmental impact of trucking the fuel and asked the
Mongolian Mining Corporation to build a paved road from the mine
to the Chinese border, while improving safety and environmental
standards, Xinhua reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
