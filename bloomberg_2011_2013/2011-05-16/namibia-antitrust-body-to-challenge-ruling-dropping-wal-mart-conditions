Namibia’s Competition Commission
will appeal a High Court ruling that conditions set by the
antitrust body on  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s purchase of a
controlling stake in  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  are invalid, its
Chairman Lucius Murorua said.  The commission will argue in the Supreme Court that laws
establishing it surpass previous legislation on which the High
Court based its ruling, Murorua said in an e-mailed statement
today from Windhoek, the capital.     The antitrust body had approved the deal on various
conditions, including that Wal-Mart guarantee it won’t cut jobs
and that it offers shares to black citizens of the southern
African country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
