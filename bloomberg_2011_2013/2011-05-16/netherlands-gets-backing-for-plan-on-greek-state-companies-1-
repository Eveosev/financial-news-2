The Netherlands said it got support
from  Germany  and three other euro-area countries for a plan to
move Greek state-owned companies to an independent trust to
speed up their sale, using the proceeds to cut government debt.  “That construction will realize 50 billion euros ($70.8
billion), but not today or tomorrow because it won’t be worth
much if you list or sell it within weeks,” Dutch Finance
Minister Jan Kees de Jager told reporters after meeting with
European Union counterparts in Brussels today.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  and finance
ministers from Austria, Finland and Luxembourg, all AAA-rated
countries, supported the plan during a meeting of the European
People’s Party earlier today, De Jager said, adding that  Greece 
hasn’t done enough to start the promised privatizations.  The trust, which may hold state-owned airports, railroads
and water companies, can also be used as collateral for “a
possible new package, or new loans,” the Dutch minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
