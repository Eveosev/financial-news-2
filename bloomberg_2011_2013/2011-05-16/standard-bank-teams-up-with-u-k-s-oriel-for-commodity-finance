Standard Bank  Group Ltd., Africa’s
biggest bank, started an alliance with Britain’s Oriel
Securities Ltd., a corporate stock broking and advisory firm.  “The two institutions will work together to assist mining
and oil and gas companies looking across corporate finance
opportunities and transactions in the U.K,” London-based Oriel
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Standard Bank, Africa’s largest bank, last year ended its
South African stock-brokerage joint venture with  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  because both firms wanted to control their own units in
Africa’s largest economy. The lender has been hiring staff in
 London  and Johannesburg to boost its brokerage capabilities.  Standard Bank is the worst-performing stock on the six-
member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index this year, having declined
8.5 percent as compared with the average drop of 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
