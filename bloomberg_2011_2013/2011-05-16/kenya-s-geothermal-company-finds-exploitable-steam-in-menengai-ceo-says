Kenya ,  Africa ’s biggest geothermal
producer, discovered “commercially exploitable” steam deposits
in Menengai, a field that may contain as much as 1,600 megawatts
of the underground energy, the  Geothermal Development Co.  said.  The discovery about 138 kilometers (86 miles) northwest of
the capital, Nairobi, was made during the GDC’s drilling program
to sink 120 wells in the area by 2018, said Silas Simiyu, chief
executive officer of the state-run GDC, according to an e-mailed
statement from Nairobi today.  Additional testing will determine the exact energy
potential at the site, Simiyu said. “This is the mother of all
wells in Menengai,” he said.  Well-head generators that can be set up quickly to convert
steam into electricity could be installed within a year, and
larger-scale independent power producers are invited to build
conventional  power plants  in the East African nation, he said.  Kenya plans to develop 10,000 megawatts from geothermal
steam sources by 2030, shifting the East African nation’s
electricity consumption from weather-reliant hydropower sources
to more reliable supplies from geothermal.  A single exploratory well has been drilled so far, yielding
8 megawatts of geothermal energy capacity, GDC spokesman Eric
Wamanji said in an e-mailed response to questions today. The
second well is nearing completion and engineers have moved Rig
One to another site to start drilling the third well, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
