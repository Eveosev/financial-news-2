Cranswick Plc (CWK) , the foodmaker that
holds the Weight Watchers’ U.K. sausage license, said its full-
year profit rose as it sold more fresh pork to make bacon, ham
and sausages.  Net income in the year to March 31 increased to 35.3
million pounds ($57.1 million), or 74.3 pence a share, from 32.6
million pounds, or 69.8 pence a share, in the year earlier
period, the company said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales
rose 2 percent to 758.4 million pounds.  Fresh pork sales from Cranswick’s two primary processing
facilities based in East Yorkshire and Norfolk grew with
combined revenue rising 17 percent during the period, the
foodmaker said.  “Difficulties facing the U.K. consumer, along with rising
raw material prices and the dynamics of the competitive market
in which the company operates suggests that the year to March
31, 2012 may be more demanding than usual,” Chairman Martin Davey said in the statement.  U.K. households are already under pressure from the
government’s fiscal squeeze and growing inflation. A report
today by Ernst & Young’s ITEM Club showed rising prices and slow
wage growth will limit the increase in  consumer spending  to 0.6
percent in 2011 and 1.3 percent in 2012. The pre-recession
annual rate was 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
