U.K. Transport Secretary Philip Hammond is likely to announce today that a consultation process
on the future of the port of Dover, southeast  England , will be
reopened after a campaign by local people against plans to sell
the port to a private investor, the Financial Times reported.  Local Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has campaigned for
Dover, which has been owned and operated by a trust since 1606,
to become a “people’s port,” in which residents could buy
shares and help to shape the way it’s run, the newspaper said.  Elphicke has been supported by Vera Lynn, who sang the song
“The White Cliffs of Dover” in World War II, the FT said.  Dover is just one of a group of ports in England and  Wales ,
including  Milford Haven , Harwich, Poole, Shoreham and the Port
of Tyne, operated by trusts, some of them centuries old, the
newspaper said.  Hammond said the arguments of the Dover campaigners have
struck a chord with the government and that future trust port
privatizations will be considered only if there’s “significant
community participation,” the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
