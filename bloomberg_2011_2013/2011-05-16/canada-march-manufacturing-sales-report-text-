The following is the text of
 Canada 's manufacturing shipments report for March released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales increased 1.9% (+$877 million) in
March to $47.5 billion, following a 1.8% decline in
February. The transportation equipment industry (+6.3%)
accounted for just over half of the gain. Sales also rose
in the machinery and paper industries.  Higher sales were reported in 15 of 21 industries,
representing 80.0% of total manufacturing.  Constant dollar manufacturing sales rose 1.9% in March.  Despite the decline in February, manufacturing sales in
the first quarter  increased 4.0% compared with the last
three months of 2010. Sales for the first quarter ($141.6
billion) were also the highest since the third quarter of
2008 ($154.9 billion), before the economic downturn began.
Including the first quarter of 2011, sales have advanced
for seven consecutive quarters.  Sales increase in the transportation equipment industry  In the aerospace product and parts industry, production
rose 20.6% to $1.4 billion. Sales in the motor vehicle
industry advanced 4.1%, as a result of increases reported
by most auto assembly plants. Sales in the motor vehicle
industry have risen in 8 of the past 12 months.  Sales were up 4.2% in the machinery industry to $2.7
billion. Since their most recent low of $2.1 billion in
October 2009, sales have advanced in 14 of 17 months. This
advance partly reflects rising sales in the agricultural,
construction and mining machinery industry.  Sales also increased in the paper (+4.0%), food
(+0.8%), furniture and related product (+5.7%) and
computer and electronic product (+3.9%) industries.  Manufacturing sales up in most provinces  In March, nine provinces posted higher sales compared
with February, led by  Quebec  and  Alberta .  In Quebec, sales advanced 2.0% to $11.6 billion. The
increase was caused by higher production in the aerospace
product and parts industry (+31.1%). An 11.9% decline in
the  chemical industry , stemming from lower sales in the
pharmaceutical and medicine industry, partly offset the
gain.  Sales increased 3.7% in Alberta to $5.7 billion in
March. The increase largely reflected a 6.2% rise in the
chemical industry and a price-driven 3.6% advance in
petroleum and coal products. A 7.9% increase in the
machinery industry, largely stemming from higher sales of
agricultural, construction and mining machinery, also
contributed to the gain.  Sales increases in Newfoundland and Labrador (+25.8%)
and Nova Scotia (+10.4%) reflected gains in non-durable
goods industries in both provinces.  Sales edged up 0.1% to $21.4 billion in Ontario, led by
a 4.7% increase in the motor vehicle industry. The
machinery, furniture, computer and electronic product and
printing industries also contributed to the increase.
However, declines of 10.1% in the petroleum and coal
products industry and 21.8% in the miscellaneous
manufacturing industry offset almost all of the gains.  Inventory levels continue to increase  Inventory levels were up 2.1% to $62.0 billion, the
sixth consecutive monthly rise. Although 15 of 21
industries posted higher inventory levels, most of the
increase stemmed from a 21.3% advance in the petroleum and
coal products industry. The increase was related to higher
volumes of raw materials and finished product inventories
reported by some refineries, as well as an 8.2% advance in
the price of petroleum and coal products as recorded by
the Industrial Product Price Index.  Higher inventory levels were also reported by
manufacturers in the fabricated metal (+3.2%), computer
and electronic (+3.4%), machinery (+1.3%) and wood product
(+2.1%) industries.  A 1.6% decline in inventories in the primary metal
industry offset a small portion of the national increase.  The inventory-to-sales ratio remained unchanged at 1.30
in March compared with February. The ratio has declined
gradually over the past year after falling sharply in
2009.  Unfilled orders increase strongly  Unfilled orders increased 9.5% in March to $57.3
billion, the largest increase in both percentage and
dollar terms since the current series began in January
1992. Unfilled orders are now at their highest level since
June 2009.  The advance in unfilled orders reflected a 22.0% rise
in the aerospace product and parts industry. In March,
unfilled orders in the  aerospace industry  totalled $26.5
billion, up $4.8 billion from February.  Excluding the aerospace industry, unfilled orders in
the manufacturing sector rose 0.7% to $30.8 billion. The
primary metal (+8.4%), machinery (+1.3%) and fabricated
metal product (+1.8%) industries contributed to the gain.  New orders increased 11.3% to $52.5 billion in March,
largely reflecting gains in the aerospace industry.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and
are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise
specified.  Statistics Canada is releasing revised monthly
manufacturing data this month in accordance with standard
practices. Sales of goods manufactured, inventories, and
orders in current and constant dollars have been revised
back to January 2007 for unadjusted data and to January
2004 for seasonally adjusted data.  The revisions were based on three sources. The monthly
data were compared to the latest information available
from the Annual Survey of Manufactures and Logging (ASML).
Revisions were made based on new information from
respondents, the availability of more up-to-date
administrative data, and through reconciliation with the
ASML data. The seasonal adjustment parameters were also
reviewed and updated.  The revised data are now available on CANSIM.  Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and
tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills,
clothing, leather and allied products, paper, printing and
related support activities, petroleum and coal products,
chemicals, and plastics and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-
metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal
products, machinery, computer and electronic products,
electrical equipment, appliances and components,
transportation equipment, furniture and related products
and miscellaneous manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the aerospace industry and shipbuilding industries,
the value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting
monthly sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change
in inventories of goods in process and finished products
manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will
contribute to future sales assuming that the orders are
not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the
current month or not. New orders are measured as the sum
of sales for the current month plus the change in unfilled
orders from the previous month to the current month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
