(Corrects story published March 27 to show context in third
paragraph that San Leon never issued statement claiming signed
accord.)  The Iraqi oil ministry denied
signing an accord with San Leon Energy Plc to develop fields in
the southern provinces of Karbala and Najaf.  “The oil ministry denies signing new accords to explore or
develop the Merjan or West Kifil oil fields,” said ministry
spokesman Asim Jihad in an e-mailed statement today. “The
signing of accords is either done through a process of
competitive bidding, or through openly declared programs.”  San Leon on March 22 said it will submit a joint proposal
with Al-Meinaa Oil Services Co. and the Governorate Council of
Karbala to the oil ministry to develop the two fields. The
company hasn’t said it has an agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
