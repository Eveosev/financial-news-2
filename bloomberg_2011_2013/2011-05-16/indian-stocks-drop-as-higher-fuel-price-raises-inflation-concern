India ’s shares declined after
inflation was faster than estimated in April and as the biggest
gasoline price increase since 2008 fanned concern the central
bank may raise  interest rates .  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the nation’s largest maker of
sport-utility vehicles and tractors, retreated to a seven-week
low as Indian Oil Corp.  raised  the price of gasoline by 8.5
percent in  New Delhi , the most since June 2008.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) ,
the second-biggest lender, fell 1.6 percent as the commerce
ministry said the wholesale-price index rose 8.66 percent in
April from a year earlier. Nineteen economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast an average 8.5 percent increase.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
194.93, or 1.1 percent, to 18,336.35, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. A panel of ministers will
review prices of diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene
next week,  Press Trust of India  reported yesterday, citing
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange
dropped 0.9 percent to 5,497.35 and its May futures traded at
5,490.10. The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.9 percent to 2,273.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
