The U.S.  Supreme Court  refused to
consider  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) ’s bid to re-establish the drugmaker’s
exclusive right to sell the cancer medicine Gemzar.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision invalidating a patent that would have protected Gemzar
from generic competition in the U.S. until May 2013.  Hospira Inc. (HSP)  and  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  began
selling generic versions after the lower court ruling. Had the
Supreme Court intervened and backed Lilly, those two companies
might have had to pay damages and pull their products from the
market.  Gemzar, whose chemical name is gemcitabine, generated U.S.
sales of $723 million for Indianapolis-based Lilly last year,
with generic competition beginning Nov. 15. The drug is used for
lung, breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.  The appeals court ruling was a victory for India’s  Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) , a generic-drug manufacturer that
challenged the Lilly patent. Trade groups representing brand-
name drug and biotechnology companies joined Lilly in urging
Supreme Court review.  Lilly is also waging a separate patent fight with Hospira
at the U.S. International Trade Commission.  The case is Eli Lilly v. Sun Pharmaceutical, 10-972.  To contact the reporter on this story:
