Delta Corp. Ltd., Zimbabwe’s largest
brewer and soft-drinks maker, plans to spend $14 million
building a new carbonated beverages plant by the end of July,
Finance Director Rob Maunsell said.  The 42,000-bottle an hour plant, made by Germany’s  Krones
AG (KRN) , will ease tight capacity in Zimbabwe’s sparkling drinks
market, he said in an e-mail yesterday. Sales of sparkling
beverages, including  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  brands, jumped 53 percent
during the 12 months to March 31, according to  Delta .  The company, in which  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  has a 37 percent stake,
also plans to order a new lager plant “within a couple of
months,” Maunsell said. Delta produced 1.6 million hectoliters
of clear beer  during the year  and 1.2 million hectoliters of
sparkling drinks.  Delta’s lager production rose 40 percent during its last
financial year, as Zimbabwe’s economy expanded about 8 percent,
the company said. Sales were boosted by the addition of a
42,000-bottle an hour bottling plant in  Zimbabwe ’s second-city,
Bulawayo, it said.  Delta, based in Harare, posted an attributable profit after
tax and deductions of $53 million last year, 47 percent more
than a year earlier, it said on May 12. Delta is Zimbabwe’s
biggest company by market capitalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
