Madras Fertilizers Ltd. (MDF) , an Indian
state-run company, surged the most in more than a month
following a report that  India  may write off 5.5 billion rupees
($122 million) of loans to help revive the company.  The stock surged as much as 14 percent to 29.85 rupees, the
biggest climb since April 4, and traded at 28.9 rupees as of
2:59 p.m. in Mumbai, up 11 percent.  India’s fertilizer ministry is considering the plan to
waive the loans, the Press Trust of India reported, citing an
official it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
