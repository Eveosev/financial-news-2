Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA (UBI) ,
 Italy ’s fourth-largest bank, said first-quarter profit jumped 70
percent as it reduced expenses and provisions for bad loans.  Net income rose to 64.6 million euros ($91.1 million) from
38.1 million euros a year earlier, the Bergamo, Italy-based
company said in a statement today. That missed the 66.9 million-
euro average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
lender said it’s targeting net income of more than 600 million
euros in 2013 and aims for about 1.1 billion euros in 2015.  Chief Executive Officer Victor Massiah is selling assets
and shares to boost capital before the implementation of
stricter capital rules. The bank, which proposed selling as much
as 1 billion euros of new shares in March, said today that the
guidelines of a five-year business plan including 1,000 job cuts
by 2015 have been approved.  “The increase in short-term  interest rates  should favor a
recovery in net interest income,” UBI said today. The lender
forecast higher operating profit for the year, while costs may
be unchanged.  Loan-loss provisions plunged 21 percent to 105 million
euros in the first quarter, while operating costs declined 3
percent to 596 million euros. Net interest income fell 1 percent
to 528 million euros.  UBI’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial
strength, was unchanged at 6.9 percent at the end of March. The
common equity ratio is estimated at 8.2 percent in 2013, and 8.9
percent in 2015. The bank seeks to pay out more than 50 percent
of profit in dividends annually.  UBI shares declined 2 percent to 5.76 euros in Milan
trading on May 13, giving the company a market value of about
3.7 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
