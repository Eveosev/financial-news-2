Wananchi Group Ltd. , a Kenyan
provider of Internet and cable television services, raised $57.5
million from a group of international investors to fund its
expansion, one of the company’s shareholders said.  “The capital will be used to support the launch of
Wananchi’s direct-to-home satellite pay TV offering in the
greater East Africa region to 10 countries; Kenya, Uganda,
Tanzania,  Ethiopia ,  Eritrea , South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi,
Malawi and Somalia,” Emerging Capital Partners, a pan-African
private equity firm with $1.8 billion in capital under
management, said in an e-mailed statement today. The funds will
also be used to continue rolling out the company’s fiber-optic
network, it added.  Wananchi signed a five-year renewable lease for a pair of
fiber-optic links in February 2010 and pays 27 million shillings
($312,862) a year for each to  Kenya  Power and Lighting Co., the
East African nation’s sole electricity distributor.  New investors in Wananchi’s financing include Liberty
Global Inc., a cables company, Oppenheimer Funds, and Sarona
Asset Management, a Canadian-based emerging-markets fund manager
seeking investments, the statement said.  Existing investors include  East Africa Capital Partners
Ltd. , a Kenyan venture capital company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
