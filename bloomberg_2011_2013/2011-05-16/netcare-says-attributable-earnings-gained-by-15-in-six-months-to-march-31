Netcare Ltd. (NTC) , South Africa’s largest
private-hospital operator, said fiscal first-half profit jumped
15 percent as increased revenue from patients in its home market
compensated for lower earnings out of the U.K.  Net income rose to 666 million rand ($95 million) in the
six months ended March 31 from 579 million rand a year earlier,
the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. Sales
grew 3.2 percent to 11.4 billion rand, Netcare said.  “Recessionary pressures in the U.K. economy are expected
to prevail for at least the remainder of this year, constraining
growth,” Netcare said, adding that demand for private
healthcare services in South African will be sustained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
