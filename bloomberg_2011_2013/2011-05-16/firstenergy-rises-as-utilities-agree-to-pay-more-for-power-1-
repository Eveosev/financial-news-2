FirstEnergy Corp. (FE) , which completed a
$4.7 billion takeover of Allegheny Energy Inc. in February, rose
after utilities agreed to pay four times more than last year for
access to power generation in seven states.  FirstEnergy, which earlier gained as much as 7.7 percent,
climbed $1.95, or 4.6 percent, to $44.48 at 1:07 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.  PJM Interconnection Interconnection LLC., which manages
most of the electric grid from Washington D.C. to  Chicago ,
announced capacity generation prices Friday, following an
auction. The price for generating capacity in the western part
of PJM Interconnection LLC, rose to $125.99 per megawatt day in
the 2014 to 2015 period, the grid manager said in a statement on
May 13. That compares with a price of  $27.73 per megawatt day  in
the 2013 to 2014 period set in a 2010 auction.  FirstEnergy, which owns  power plants  in the western part of
the PJM including Pennsylvania and  Ohio , is the “biggest winner
in this auction,” Michael Worms, a New York-based analyst for
BMO Capital Markets, wrote today in a note to investors. The
rates were twice as much as the $40 a megawatt to $60 a megawatt
a day that analysts expected, according to the note.  Expenses to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency’s pollution regulations likely increased the bidding
price for western generators, Worms wrote.  The PJM auction allows utilities to bid on power plant
capacity, to secure enough capacity to serve their customers
during the time period covered in the auction. The price of the
electric power will be set later.  PJM and other wholesale markets devised the system as a way
to compensate power generation companies for investments in
their plants.  FirstEnergy, based in Akron, Ohio, owns about 24,000
megawatts of capacity, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
