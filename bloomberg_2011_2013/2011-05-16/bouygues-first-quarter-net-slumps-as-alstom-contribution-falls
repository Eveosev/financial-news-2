Bouygues SA (EN) , the French building,
television and telecommunications company, said first-quarter
profit fell 81 percent, hurt by a lower contribution from its
stake in Alstom SA.  Net income declined to 34 million euros ($48 million) from
181 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
in a statement today. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast
a profit of 129 million euros, according to the average of six
estimates.  Sales, which rose 3.8 percent to 6.69 billion euros in the
quarter, may total 31.9 billion euros in 2011, Bouygues said. In
March, the company predicted full-year sales of 31.7 billion
euros, compared with 2010 revenue of 31.2 billion euros.  Bouygues is cutting jobs at Colas, its road-building unit,
to restore margins hurt by a construction slump in central
 Europe  and price competition in  France  last year. The company,
which owns Franceâ€™s third-largest mobile-phone operator, is also
facing an increase in the value-added  sales tax  in 2011.  The company reiterated that its 31 percent stake in train-
and power-equipment maker Alstom SA added 23 million euros to
net income in the first quarter, down from 115 million euros a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
