The head of Munich-based  Siemens AG (SI) ’s
U.S. unit said he is unhappy that federal energy policymakers in
 Washington  are no longer focusing on climate change.  Eric Spiegel, chief executive officer of Siemens Corp.,
said a national strategy is needed to reduce clean-energy
technology costs and find solutions for environmental risks
associated with  greenhouse gases . Siemens is making wind-turbine
components in Hutchinson, Kansas, and is “well on track to
become one of the world’s top three providers” of turbines,
according to a statement in December.  Congress no longer seems interested in tackling the issue,
Spiegel said today at a clean-energy conference in Washington.  “I’m pretty concerned about where we are on climate
change,” he said.  There were “billions and billions and
billions of dollars” in projects waiting to go forward had
Congress passed climate legislation, Spiegel said. The U.S.
House passed  climate-change  legislation in 2009. The bill died
in the Senate last year.  Without legislation requiring cuts to emissions of carbon
dioxide and gases linked to global warming, a national mandate
for renewable energy production would spur more investment in
innovation than tax cuts would, Spiegel said.  “We need to drive down the cost of clean energy
technologies,” Spiegel said at the conference, which was
organized by the  Howard Baker Forum , the  Bipartisan Policy
Center  and  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .  To contact the reporter on this story:
