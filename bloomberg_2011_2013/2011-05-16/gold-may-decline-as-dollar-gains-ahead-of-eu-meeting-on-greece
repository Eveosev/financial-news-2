Gold may decline for a second day in
London trading as the dollar advanced amid concerns that
Europe’s debt woes will worsen.  Greece  today will plead for a boost to its 110 billion-euro
($155 billion) bailout from European governments and the
 International Monetary Fund  in talks clouded by the arrest of
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn. The  U.S. dollar 
gained as much as 0.3 percent against a basket of six currencies
to the highest level in more than a month.  “The main reason for prices falling is the uncertainty
about the financial bailout for Greece, which is putting
pressure on the euro,” Commerzbank AG analyst  Eugen Weinberg 
said in a report today.  Immediate-delivery gold gained as much as 0.2 percent and
fell as much as 0.5 percent before trading $2.85 lower at
$1,492.18 an ounce by 11:42 a.m. in  London . Gold futures for
June delivery declined 0.2 percent to $1,490.30 on the Comex in
 New York . Spot silver lost as much as 3.9 percent to $34.04 an
ounce and last traded at $34.1612 an ounce in London.  Gold declined to $1,495 an ounce in the morning “fixing,”
used by some mining companies to sell output, from $1,505.75 at
the afternoon fixing on May 13.  The euro fell as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar
today, and rose as much as 0.2 percent. Gold typically moves
inversely to the greenback.  Bullion also declined after Touradji Capital Management LP
sold all of its shares in the largest exchange-traded fund
backed by bullion.  Exchange-Traded Products  Gold assets held in exchange-traded products declined 9.19
metric tons to 2,040.78 tons on May 13, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Eleven of 16 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 69 percent, said bullion will rise this week.
Three predicted lower prices and two were neutral.  “There is still a lot to fret about here for an average
investor who remains tense over debt troubles in the monetary
union and will think twice about getting out of those gold longs
in the near term,” VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov said
in a report today.  Gold has gained 5 percent this year after a 30 percent jump
in 2010 as the prospect of currency debasement and accelerating
inflation drove up investor demand.  Europe ’s debt crisis and
fighting in the Middle East also contributed to the rally,
spurring haven demand.  “With the outlook for PGMs blemished by the disruption in
the global auto sector supply chain and silver continuing to
trade in extremely volatile conditions, we expect investors will
look increasingly toward gold to hedge systemic financial
risk,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by  Hussein Allidina  said in
a report today, referring to platinum-group metals.  Immediate-delivery palladium was little-changed at $708 an
ounce, while platinum fell 0.3 percent to $1,759.57 an ounce.  -- With assistance from Kyoungwha Kim in  Singapore . Editors:
