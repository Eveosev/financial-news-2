Greek 10-year government bonds fell
as the nation prepared to request a boost to its 110 billion-
euro ($155 billion) bailout from European governments.  The spread, or yield difference, between Greek 10-year
bonds and German bunds of similar maturity widened for the first
time in three days. German securities declined as a report
showed European inflation accelerated at the fastest pace since
2008 last month, matching an earlier estimate. Irish two-year
note yields rose to a euro-era record.  “There’s a bit more  risk aversion  the closer we get to the
event,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “Markets
are drifting a bit lower. The meetings are putting widening
pressure on spreads.”  Yields on Greek 10-year bonds rose 18 basis points to 15.62
percent at 4:35 p.m. in London. The 6.25 percent security due in
June 2020 fell 0.55, or 5.5 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,422) face
amount, to 56.01. Greek two-year notes yielded 24.83 percent,
seven basis points lower than the previous close of trading,
after rising as high as 25.06 percent.  Europe ’s donor countries, led by  Germany , are demanding
deeper budget cuts from the Greek government in exchange for
granting more aid or giving it more time to pay back official
loans. Leaders from the 17-member bloc are also weighing whether
to make bondholders share bailout costs after  Portugal  this year
became the third euro-area country, following  Greece  and
Ireland, to seek financial assistance.  Debt Rescheduling  Irish European Affairs Minister Lucinda Creighton said the
nation is not “at this point in time” seeking to reschedule
debt stemming from its bailout last year. In an interview with
Dublin-based RTE radio, she said the government is focusing on
winning a reduction to the country’s bailout rate.  Irish two-year note yields climbed to a euro-era record of
12.69 percent before retreating to 12.35 percent, seven basis
points down from the previous close.  Declines in so-called peripheral euro-nation debt come as
the prospect of rising European borrowing costs threatens to
exacerbate the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. The European
Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.25
percent on May 5 though President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
policy makers continue to see “upward pressure” on inflation.  Trichet also indicated policy makers may raise rates after
June amid accelerating economic growth in Germany and  France .  Tightening Cycle  “Strong German GDP last week suggests the ECB will be able
to conduct its tightening cycle,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-
income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “Data indicates
the ECB is about to flag its next rate hike in June for July.”  German gross domestic product jumped 1.5 percent in the
first quarter compared with the final three months of last year
while French GDP rose 1 percent, exceeding economists’ median
forecasts of 0.9 percent and 0.6 percent respectively, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said May 13.  Consumer-price growth in the 17-nation euro region
quickened to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent in March, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. That’s in
line with an initial estimate published on April 29 and the
fastest since October 2008.  “Focus is on the CPI data,” said Schnautz. “Inflation
data has surprised consistently on the upside.”  German Yield Curve  Yields on German two-year notes gained four basis points to
1.81 percent. The 1.75 percent security due in June 2013 traded
at 99.875. The 10-year yield also added four basis points, to
3.12 percent. It slipped to 3.07 percent earlier, the lowest
level since March 16.  The spread between German two- and 10-year securities was
at 131 basis points, within one basis point of the least since
January 2009, according to closing prices. The narrowing spread
signals investors are reducing holdings of the shorter-maturity
notes, which are more sensitive to prospects for rate increases
from the  European Central Bank .  Euribor futures fell, pushing the implied yield on the
December contract four basis points higher to 2.03 percent as
traders added to bets that the ECB will raise borrowing costs.
The rate has climbed from 1.33 percent on Dec. 31.  Greece plans to sell 1.25 billion euros of 91-day Treasury
bills tomorrow, while  Belgium  is scheduled to sell up to 700
million euros of 91-day bills and 1.6 billion euros of 364-day
bills.  Spain  is due to sell 12- and 18-month bills.  German bonds have handed investors a 0.6 percent loss this
year, compared with a 1.9 percent return for Treasuries,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek debt has lost
11 percent, Portuguese bonds have dropped 13.8 percent, while
Irish securities have declined 7.6 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
