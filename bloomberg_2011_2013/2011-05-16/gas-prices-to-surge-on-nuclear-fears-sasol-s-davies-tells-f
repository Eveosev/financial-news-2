Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  Chief Executive Officer
Pat Davies said natural-gas prices will rise because of fears
about nuclear-power expansion sparked by the Japanese disaster,
leading to greater demand for gas, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview.  Gas prices will also be boosted by growing demand in China
and by climate-change concerns, Davies said, according to the
FT. The company is looking into opportunities to invest in
countries including Uzbekistan, Australia, Papua New Guinea and
 South Africa , the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
