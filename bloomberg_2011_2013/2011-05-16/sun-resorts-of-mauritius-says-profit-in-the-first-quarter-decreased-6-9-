Sun Resorts Ltd., Mauritius’s
second-biggest hotel chain and tourist operator, said profit
fell 6.9 percent in the first quarter through March as arrivals
from all its main European markets except  France  declined.  Net income retreated to 153.3 million rupees from 164.6
million rupees, the company said in a statement on the Port
Louis-based Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s website today. Revenue
decreased 1.9 percent to 969.8 million rupees.  “The second-quarter results will benefit from the Easter
period but the low season, beginning in May, is expected to
remain very competitive in all market segments,” the company
said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
