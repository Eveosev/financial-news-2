Brazilian homebuilder  Tecnisa SA (TCSA3)  is
planning to sell bonds or real-estate backed securities to raise
between 100 million reais and 150 million reais ($92 million) to
cut debt costs, Chief Financial Officer Thomas Brull said.  Tecnisa, the eighth-largest homebuilder in the country by
market value, may sell the bonds in the local market in the
second half, Brull said in an interview at the Bloomberg Sao
Paulo office today. The sale will also strengthen the company’s
cash position and expand the range of investors involved in
Tecnisa, he said. The company could also sell debt abroad
“depending on market conditions”, Brull said.  Total debt reached 1.3 billion reais in the first quarter,
up from 958.4 million reais a year earlier. Some 230 million
reais of this debt matures this year, and another 206 million
reais in 2012, Brull said. The homebuilder had 582 million reais
in cash and financial investments at the end of March, up 59
percent compared with the same period in 2010.  “Tecnisa is having a good time. We should take advantage
of this to seek investors and reduce costs,” Brull said. The
average cost of Tecnisa’s debt is 3 percent higher than  Brazil ’s
interbank overnight rate, known as CDI, which was 11.9 percent
today. The instruments are typically sold to Brazilian pension
funds and private banks seeking higher yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
