Niall Ferguson , a professor of
history at  Harvard University  in the U.S., said Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. seems like a “well-run bank” compared with the
debt on some German lenders’ balance sheets, Swiss television
show ECO reported, citing an interview.  A restructuring of Greek debt is “unavoidable,” Ferguson
was quoted as saying on the TV station’s  website . The future of
the euro zone largely depends on  Germany , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
