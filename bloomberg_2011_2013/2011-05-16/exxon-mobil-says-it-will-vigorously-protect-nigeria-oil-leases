Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Nigerian unit
said it will work with the country’s government to resolve
“confusion” about the status of three oil leases following a
media report they have been canceled.  Oil leases 67, 68 and 70, which together produce 580,000
barrels of crude a day, were nullified by Nigerian Petroleum
Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke in a March 4 letter to  Exxon
Mobil , Lagos-based ThisDay newspaper reported today.  Exxon Mobil “will vigorously protect the rights it
acquired in 2009,” Gloria Essien-Danner, a company spokeswoman,
said in by e-mail today. “We will work with the Minister of
Petroleum Resources and other relevant government officials to
resolve any confusion that may exist on this matter.”  Negotiations for 16 oil blocks operated by companies
including Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp.
have been under way for two years. Exxon Mobil was the only
energy company to have its licenses renewed when it signed a
deal in November 2009 covering oil leases 67, 68 and 70. Shell
and Chevron remain in talks with  Nigeria  on renewing their
expired oil licenses. China National Offshore Oil Corp. had
expressed an interest in taking over some of the permits,
raising concern they wouldn’t be renewed.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, is the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. oil imports. Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Total
SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures with the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp., which pumps about 90 percent of the
country’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
