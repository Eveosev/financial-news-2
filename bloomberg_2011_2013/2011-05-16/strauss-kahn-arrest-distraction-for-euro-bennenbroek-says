Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency
strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York, comments on the
impact on the euro of International Monetary Fund Managing
Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s arrest in New York on
attempted-rape charges, Speaking in an interview with Betty Liu
on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop,” he also focuses on
prospects for the dollar as the U.S. debt limit is reached.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said today he has
taken actions to stave off the federal debt limit until Aug. 2.  On the impact of Strauss-Kahn’s arrest:  “There is the issue of how much of a distraction it is and
how much it could factor into getting an appropriate agreement
for  Greece . There’s a lot of political noise at this point in
time, so this distraction isn’t helpful.”  “As far as the euro is concerned, and it’s been struggling
recently, we’ve been waiting for a resolution. The euro’s going
to be under a little bit of pressure until we get a scope on the
Greece situation.”  On the U.S. debt limit:  “The clock starts ticking until August, when the hard
ceiling is hit. Right now we’re OK. The market does think we’ll
get an increase, so it’s not a problem right now.”  “If we still haven’t got a resolution by late June, early
July, then nervousness will shift to the dollar.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
