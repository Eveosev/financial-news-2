Mexico ’s fluid-milk production will
climb to 11.333 million metric tons this year from 11.201
million tons in 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
 Foreign Agricultural Service  said today in a  report  on its
website.  The 2011 output estimate is revised from a previous
projection of 11.5 million tons, the USDA said. The forecast was
lowered because of “higher production costs, adverse weather
conditions, and lower-than-expected cows in milk,” according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
