Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, will split its mobility unit into divisions
dedicated to trains and logistics, the German manufacturer said.  The infrastructure and cities sector will now have six
divisions: building technologies, low- and medium-voltage
products, the Osram lighting unit, smart grids, train
manufacturing and logistics systems, Joern Roggenbuck, a
spokesman for Munich-based Siemens, said today. The logistics
business includes air freight and mail sorting systems, he said.
Reuters reported the split earlier.  Hans-Joerg Grundmann, who currently runs the mobility unit,
will lead the trainmaking business, and Sami Atiya, previously a
manager in the company’s health care business, will handle
logistics systems, Roggenbuck said. The new structure will be
effective from Oct. 1, the start of Siemens’s fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
