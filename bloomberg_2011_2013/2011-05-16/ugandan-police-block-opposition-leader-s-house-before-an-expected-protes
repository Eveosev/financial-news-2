Uganda’s main opposition leader,
 Kizza Besigye , called off a planned protest against the rising
cost of living because of illness, as the authorities deployed
police at the entrance to his home and seized his vehicle.  “I was really not going to walk because I have a flu,”
Besigye told reporters today inside his home in Kasangati, 17
kilometers (11 miles) north of Kampala, the capital. “Without
doubt” the protests will resume when he recovers, Besigye said.  Besigye has been repeatedly arrested over the past month as
he led so-called walk-to-work protests against surging prices
for food and gasoline. Inflation accelerated to 14.1 percent in
April from 11.1 percent in March, as food costs jumped 31
percent, according to the  Uganda  Bureau of Statistics.  Earlier today, police seized a car in which they thought
Besigye was travelling and towed it to a local police station,
his wife, Winnie Byanyima, said in an interview.  “As soon as they noticed that Dr. Besigye was not inside,
they let us go from the police station,” said Byanyima, who was
in the car at the time.  Besigye came second in a presidential election in February
in which incumbent President Yoweri Museveni extended his 25-
year rule after garnering 68.38 percent of the ballots cast.
Four opposition parties claimed the vote was rigged and rejected
the outcome, calling for a new election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
