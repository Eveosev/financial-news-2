Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan 
said Ireland isn’t looking to reschedule its debt.  “From a policy point of view, the only item which the
Irish government is negotiating with the troika at present is a
possible interest-rate reduction,” Noonan told reporters in
Brussels today. “There is no other item that we are
negotiating.”  “We hope to get our country back to growth pattern and we
would hope to fulfill the conditions of the bailout and we would
hope to get out of this situation as time goes by and go back
the markets,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
