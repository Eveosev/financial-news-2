OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, gained for the first day in four as a share-swap
deadline approached.  Rosneft gained as much as 1.3 percent and closed up 0.1
percent at 230.57 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow.  BP Plc is seeking to agree on a buyout of its billionaire
partners in TNK-BP, Russia’s third-largest oil producer, in a
bid to save the planned share swap with state-controlled
Rosneft, said people with knowledge of the talks.  TNK-BP jumped 3.4 percent to 82.69 rubles, its biggest gain
since February. BP slid 1 percent to 437.90 pence in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
