Job vacancies at London’s financial-
services companies rose 15 percent in April as firms rehired
following the credit crisis, according to a recruitment
consultant.  The number of openings in the City, London’s main financial
district, and elsewhere in the capital rose to 6,426 last month
from 5,569 in April 2010, executive search firm  Morgan McKinley 
said today. The figure was flat compared with the previous
month.  “Following the short working month of April 2011, all
indicators point to an upward trend over May and June,”  Andrew Evans , chief operations officer of Morgan McKinley’s financial-
services unit, said in the statement. “Any increase in hiring
is likely to be measured.”  Britain’s Conservative-led coalition government is relying
on private companies to create jobs over the next four years as
the government axes more than 300,000 public-sector posts in the
biggest fiscal squeeze since World War II.  The number of people seeking jobs fell 17 percent to 13,110
in April from a month earlier, Morgan McKinley said. Average
City salaries slid 4 percent last month to 52,228 pounds
($84,724), the survey showed.  The time taken to fill new jobs in April was on average 60
days, nine days more than the previous month, the survey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
