venture between her and  MGM Resorts International. (MGM)  Pansy Ho, 48,
is chairwoman and executive director of MGM China, according to
a  filing  to the  Hong Kong  stock exchange on May 9.  The casino operator is starting the sale after gambling
revenue in Macau rose 58 percent last year to 188.3 billion
patacas ($23.5 billion), about four times that of the  Las Vegas
Strip . MGM China received orders covering all the stock offered
to institutional investors on the first day of marketing the IPO,

decades before the entry of foreign casino operators starting
from 2002. Casino revenue in Macau climbed 43 percent to 79
billion patacas in the first four months of this year, according
to data from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.  Revenue Forecast  Macau gambling revenue may rise more than 25 percent in
2011, cementing the city’s position as the world’s biggest
gambling hub by sales, said  Standard & Poor’s  credit analyst
Joe Poon said in a report.  Pansy Ho will sell a 20 percent stake in MGM China to the
public and another 1 percent stake to MGM Resorts, leaving her
with 29 percent, the Las Vegas-based company said in a statement
on April 13.  MGM Resorts, founded by billionaire  Kirk Kerkorian , would
gain control of MGM China by acquiring the 1 percent stake from
Pansy Ho, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
