Wall Street firms may cut staff if
revenue continues to slump through the second quarter, according
to Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.  “We’re talking a few percent on the net,” Schorr said in
a radio interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  “Most firms will cull what they’ll call the bottom five to
10 percent each year to make room for new recruits," Schorr
said. "It usually doesn’t happen at the high end of that range.
However, when the revenue environment becomes challenged the way
it is now, should that drag on, it unfortunately is part of the
purging process.”  Net revenue at the six biggest U.S. banks --  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Wells Fargo
& Co.,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  -- fell 13.3
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Second-quarter trading and banking
businesses have started off slower than expected, Schorr said.  Schorr said he prefers asset managers to broker-dealers in
recommending stocks because asset managers don’t face as many
regulatory issues.  Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , the San Mateo,
California-based manager of the Franklin and Templeton mutual
funds, is his top “buy,” Schorr said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
