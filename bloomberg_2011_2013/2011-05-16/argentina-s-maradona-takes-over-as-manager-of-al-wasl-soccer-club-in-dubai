Diego Maradona , who led Argentina to
the 1986  World Cup  as a player, will take over as manager of the
Al Wasl soccer club in Dubai.  The 50-year-old has a two-season contract, Al Wasl said
today in an e-mailed statement. Financial terms weren’t
disclosed, although the team said the value of the contract is
“worthy of the stature and reputation” of Maradona.  Maradona last year coached Argentina during the World Cup,
the most watched sporting event, in South Africa. He was captain
of the team in 1986 when Argentina beat West Germany 3-2 in the
final.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
