Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) , which extracts
minerals from the  Dead Sea  to make fertilizer, said first-
quarter net income rose 16 percent as higher phosphate and
potash prices boosted revenue.  Net income increased to $279.7 million from $240.5 million
a year earlier, the company said in a statement to the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange today. That topped the $268.5 million average
estimate of two analysts on Bloomberg. Revenue climbed to $1.53
billion from $1.38 billion.  Prices for crop nutrients such as potassium, nitrogen and
phosphorus increased, spurred by higher corn, soybean and wheat
futures, as unfavorable weather and growing global food demand
depleted agricultural inventories. Potash, a form of potassium,
rose to about $654 a metric ton at the end of the first quarter,
19 percent more than a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg
index of U.S. Midwest prices.  “Results in the quarter were better than expected, as
grain prices grew on increased demand for food,” Gilad Alper, a
Tel Aviv-based senior analyst at Meitav Investment House Ltd.
said by telephone. “The direction of the company’s share price
will be determined by commodities prices going forward.”  The shares climbed 1.9 percent to 57.07 shekels at 10:41
