Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL) , the country’s
largest mobile-phone operator, said first-quarter profit fell
2.5 percent on higher financing expenses as inflation
accelerated.  Net income dropped to 306 million shekels ($87 million)
from 314 million shekels in the year-earlier period, the company
said in a PR Newswire statement today. That compares with a
median estimate of 264 million shekels, according to three
analyst on Bloomberg. Revenue was little changed at 1.59 billion
shekels.  “Cellcom results met our estimates and even exceeded
them,” Eran Jacoby, head of research at DS Securities and
Investments, said in a telephone interview.  April consumer prices exceeded the government’s 1 percent
to 3 percent target for the fourth consecutive month. Annual
inflation was 4 percent last month after 4.3 percent in March,
the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  said yesterday.
Cellcom’s financing expenses increased to 67 million shekels in
the quarter from 36 million shekels in the year-earlier period.  Cellcom shares lost 0.5 percent to 108.70 shekels at the
