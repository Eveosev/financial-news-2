India ’s 10-year bonds rose, reversing
an earlier decline, on speculation a government report will show
inflation slowed last month.  Yields retreated from near a 31-month high before data from
the commerce ministry due at noon in Mumbai that will show
wholesale prices increased 8.50 percent in April from a year
earlier, compared with 8.98 percent the previous month,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Bonds fell earlier after the South Asian nation
raised gasoline prices yesterday by the most in three years.  “Despite an early negative reaction to the petrol price
increase, an improvement in the monthly inflation number should
maintain support for bonds,” said Pradeep Madhav, Mumbai-based
managing director at Securities Trading Corp., a primary dealer
which underwrites government debt.  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.26 percent as of
10:50 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It climbed to 8.29 percent earlier, near the highest
level for a 10-year government bond since October 2008.  State-owned Indian Oil Corp., the country’s largest refiner,
raised the price of petrol by 5 rupees a liter to 63.37 rupees
($1.41) in  New Delhi , the company said on its website. That was
the biggest increase since June 2008.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
declined two basis points to 8.05 percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
