The  International Monetary Fund  said
it postponed a board meeting to consider the matter of its
managing director,  Dominique Strauss-Kahn .  “"The tentatively scheduled informal briefing of the
executive board has been postponed pending further developments
in New York,” IMF spokesman William Murray said in a statement
sent by e-mail. The IMF had said earlier the meeting was
expected today.   Strauss-Kahn, who was also considered to be a potential
candidate for the French presidency, was charged with attempted
rape and a criminal sex act on a New York hotel maid, police
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
