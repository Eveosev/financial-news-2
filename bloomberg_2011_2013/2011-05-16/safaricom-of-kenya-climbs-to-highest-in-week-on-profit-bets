Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s biggest
mobile-phone company, rose to the highest in more than a week on
speculation its revenue and profit in the year through March
will rise.  The company’s share price increased 10 cents, or 2.6
percent, to 4 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital,
Nairobi, the strongest closing level since May 5.  Revenue is expected to jump 14 percent to 96.1 billion
shillings ($1.1 billion) while earnings per share will rise 8.6
percent to 0.415 shilling, Eric Musau, an analyst at Nairobi-
based African Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd., said by phone
today. African Alliance’s forecast is higher than the 0.353
shilling mean estimate by seven analysts polled by Bloomberg.  Safaricom will announce full-year earnings on May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
