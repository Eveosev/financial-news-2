Belarus’s ruble was trading 30
percent weaker at banks and exchange kiosks in Minsk than the
nation’s official rate after the central bank ended restrictions
on currency sales last week.  The ruble traded at 3,992.5 per dollar today, according to
the median mid-price quoted by eight banks in the Belarusian
capital. The National Bank of the Republic of Belarus’s  official
rate  is 3,084 per dollar for today and 3,120 rubles for
tomorrow, according to its website. The currency was trading 23
percent below the official rate on May 12, the median of six
banks showed.  The former Soviet republic lifted restrictions on foreign-
currency sales to households May 11 and increased its benchmark
interest rate to 14 percent, the highest in the world, in a bid
to bolster the economy and curb a run on the ruble. Belarus’s
foreign-currency reserves hit a 1 1/2-year low in March and the
current-account deficit reached 16 percent of gross domestic
product, prompting President Aleksandr Lukashenko to look to
 Russia  and other partners for a bailout.  Belarusbank , the nation’s largest lender was buying $1 for
3,990 rubles and selling for 4,000 rubles, according to data on
the bank’s website today.  Deltabank  was buying dollars at 3,999
rubles and selling at 4,000.  BPS-Bank  and  Bank Moscow-Minsk  were
offering the lowest price for dollars of the eight banks, buying
at 3,950 rubles and selling at 4,000.  Lenders have been given an “oral recommendation” from the
central bank to not trade the ruble below 4,000 per dollar, the
Belapan newswire  reported  May 12.  On the  interbank market , where requirements to keep the
ruble within 2 percent of the official rate were abolished on
April 19, the currency is trading at 6,225 per dollar today,
according to prices supplied to Bloomberg by Belagroprombank,
the country’s second-biggest lender by assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
