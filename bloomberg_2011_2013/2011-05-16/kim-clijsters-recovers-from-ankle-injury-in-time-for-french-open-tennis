U.S. and Australian Open tennis
champion  Kim Clijsters  will play in next week’s  French Open 
after recovering from an ankle injury, her management company
said.  The four-time major winner, ranked second on the WTA Tour,
was hurt at her cousin’s wedding party in the middle of April
when she tore and strained ligaments.  “Kim will take part in the  French Open ,” Lotte van
Reusel, a spokeswoman for Clijsters’ management company Golazo,
said in an e-mail today.  The Belgian has yet to win the French Open, which starts
May 22 in Paris. Clijsters last competed on the clay courts of
Roland Garros in 2006, when she made the semifinals.  French Open organizers announced last week that former
world No. 1  Serena Williams  and her sister Venus won’t play the
year’s second major.  Serena is still recovering from a blood clot in her lung
while her elder sister has been struggling with an abdominal
injury.  Dinara Safina, a finalist in 2008 and 2009, will also miss
 Roland Garros  as she attempts to heal her back with a long rest
from the game, the organizers said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
