The Senate Commerce Committee
announced that representatives from Facebook Inc.,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  have agreed to answer questions about how
companies collect and use consumer data on mobile devices.  The hearing, which will be held May 19, will focus on the
government’s possible role “in protecting consumers in the
mobile marketplace and promoting their privacy,” according to a
news release today from Senator  Jay Rockefeller , a West Virginia
Democrat who is chairman of the committee.  The witness list includes Bret Taylor, Facebook’s chief
technology officer; Catherine Novelli, vice president of
worldwide government affairs for Apple; and Alan Davidson,
director of public policy for Google.  This will be the second time Apple and Google have appeared
before Congress this month. Executives from the two companies
testified May 10 about mobile privacy at a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee hearing chaired by Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota
Democrat.  At that hearing, the companies, makers of software used in
millions of smartphones, defended their handling of user
location data and said they do not track individual customers.
Apple, Google and other companies use location data to deliver
targeted advertising and help customers find nearby businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
