The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The Merval Index fell 0.2 percent to 3,372.21.  Banco Macro SA (BMA)   fell 2.3 percent to 14.80 pesos,
its lowest price in eight months. The Argentine lender fell as
prices dropped for some Argentine sovereign bonds, which signals
lower value for banks’ fixed-income holdings.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)   rose 0.7 percent to 74
pesos.  Brazil ’s state-controlled oil company said first-quarter
net income increased to 10.99 billion reais ($6.73 billion), or
84 centavos a share, from 7.73 billion reais, or 88 centavos, in
the year earlier period. The company, which sold $70 billion of
shares in September, was expected to post per-share profit of 74
centavos, according to the median estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  YPF SA (YPFD AF) retreated 0.3 percent to 186.5 pesos, its
fourth day of losses. Argentine construction workers halted
output at YPF’s fields in the southern province of Chubut for
the third day today, said a company official, who can’t be
identified under corporate policy. YPF’s output from Chubut
accounts for 2.5 percent of the country’s total crude
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
