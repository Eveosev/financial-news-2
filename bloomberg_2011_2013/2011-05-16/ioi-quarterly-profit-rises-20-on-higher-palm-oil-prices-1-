IOI Corp.,  Malaysia ’s second-biggest
palm oil planter by market value, said third-quarter profit
climbed almost 20 percent, as higher prices for the cooking oil
and contributions from property boosted earnings.  Net income climbed to 656.7 million ringgit ($215 million),
or 10.25 sen a share, in the three months ended March 31, from
549.02 million ringgit, or 8.6 sen, a year earlier, the company
said in a statement today. Sales increased 38 percent to 4.34
billion ringgit.  “The group is expected to perform satisfactorily in the
current financial year underpinned by strong palm oil and palm
kernel prices and a resilient  property market ,” IOI said in the
statement. The group generates more than 7 percent of its
revenue from real estate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  IOI fetched an average 3,019 ringgit a metric ton for its
crude  palm oil  in the quarter, compared with 2,480 ringgit a
year ago, the company said. Palm futures have since dropped
after hitting a 35-month high of 3,967 ringgit a ton on Feb. 10
amid concern over expected higher output from top producers
Indonesia and Malaysia.  Global production may rise 6.6 percent to 48.6 million tons
this year as a fading La Nina weather event improves outlook for
production, Oil World said in a report on April 19.  IOI’s resource-based manufacturing segment reported a 43
percent increase in operating profit to 184.5 million ringgit.  This was worse than the same period a year earlier if you
strip out changes in fair value on derivatives contracts, which
resulted in a 99.1 million-ringgit gain in the latest quarter.
This was mainly due to lower margins from specialty fats and
oleochemicals, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
