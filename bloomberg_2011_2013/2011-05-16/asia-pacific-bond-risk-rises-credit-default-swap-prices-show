The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1.5 basis points to
108 basis points as of 10:25 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit
Agricole CIB. Thatâ€™s on track for the highest close since April
19, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  increased 1.5 basis points to 108 basis
points as of 8:25 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices
show. The index is heading for its highest close since April 18,
according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 0.5 basis points to
122 as of 10:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
