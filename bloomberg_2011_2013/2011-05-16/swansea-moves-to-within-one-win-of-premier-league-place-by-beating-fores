Swansea City beat Nottingham Forest
3-1 to reach English soccer’s Championship playoff final,
putting it within one win of securing a Premier League place.  Goals from Leon Britton, Stephen Dobbie and Darren Pratley
gave Swansea the victory at its Liberty Stadium last night to
seal a 3-1 win over the two-game semifinal.Robert Earnshaw
scored for Forest with 10 minutes remaining.  Swansea, which last played in  England ’s top division in the
1982-83 season, will face Welsh rival Cardiff or Reading in the
May 30 final at  London ’s Wembley Stadium. Cardiff hosts the
return game today following last week’s 0-0 draw in Reading.  Winning the playoff final is worth about 90 million pounds
($146 million), accountant Deloitte LLP estimates. The winner
benefits from at least 40 million pounds in additional revenue
and is guaranteed payments of at least 48 million pounds in the
following four seasons if relegated from the Premier League
straight away.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
