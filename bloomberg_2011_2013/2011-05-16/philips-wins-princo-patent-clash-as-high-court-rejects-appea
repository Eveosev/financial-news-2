The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
revive accusations that Royal Philips Electronics NV misused
patents in its licensing program for recordable compact discs.  The justices today turned away an appeal by  Princo Corp. (8053) , a
Taiwanese manufacturer barred from importing its discs into the
U.S. because they use Philipsâ€™s patented technology.  Princo accused Amsterdam-based Philips of using an
agreement with  Sony Corp. (SNE)  to suppress Sony technology that would
compete with an industry standard on the CDs. Princo, defending
itself against infringement claims at the  U.S. International
Trade Commission , argued that Philips should be barred from
enforcing its  patent rights .  A federal appeals court rejected the Princo defense,
upholding an ITC decision barring the company from importing its
discs into the U.S.  The case is Princo v. International Trade Commission, 10-
898.  To contact the reporter on this story:
