Quickening growth in  Europe  is an
indication that efforts to contain the area’s sovereign-debt
crisis haven’t derailed demand, Bank of France Governor
 Christian Noyer  said.  “Analysts who predicted that fiscal tightening would
stifle growth in the euro area are currently being proven
wrong,” Noyer said at a forum in Tokyo today. “Positive
confidence effects in the private sector are outweighing the
negative impact of public expenditure reduction.”  Germany and France powered economic growth in the euro area
in the first quarter, helping the region’s expansion accelerate
to 0.8 percent from 0.3 percent. The boost helped offset a
contraction in Portugal, where the government is cutting
spending and raising taxes to narrow the budget deficit.  Noyer, who said he was “surprised” by Europe’s recent
growth, said members of the  European Central Bank  “stand ready
to act as forcefully as necessary to ensure price stability and
preserve the integrity of the euro.” Faster growth is putting
pressure on the ECB to keep raising  interest rates  even amid
debt crises in Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  The governor also said that French banks can withstand a
sovereign default and that productivity in Ireland and Greece
has been improving.  To contact the reporter on this story:
