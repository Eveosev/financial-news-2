Former U.K. Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  has told friends that he has global support for his
candidacy for the post of managing director of the  International
Monetary Fund  that could prevail over Prime Minister David Cameron’s opposition, the Financial Times reported, citing
unidentified colleagues.  Cameron does not have a veto in the decision on who should
succeed IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Brown has
told colleagues and he is “emboldened” following meetings in
Washington and Paris, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
