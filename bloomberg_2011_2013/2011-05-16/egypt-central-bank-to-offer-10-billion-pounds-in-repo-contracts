Egypt ’s central bank will offer 10
billion Egyptian pounds ($1.7 billion) in seven-day  repurchase
agreements , or repos, tomorrow, according to its data on
Bloomberg.  The central bank last week accepted bids for 4.88 billion
pounds in bids after offering 7 billion pounds. In March, it set
the interest rate for the repo facility at 9.25 percent. The
contracts allow banks to sell government debt securities back to
the central bank for one week in order to access funds.  The yield on the North African country’s 5.75 percent debt
due in April 2020 was little changed at 6.26 percent at 4:39
p.m. in Cairo. The pound was also little changed at 5.9394 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
