What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures may open 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade as wet weather delays planting in
parts of the U.S. Midwest, while floods threaten to reduce
supplies in some areas along the  Mississippi River , said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as rain slows spring seeding in  North Dakota  and
Minnesota, while drought cuts yields in the Great Plains, Grow
said.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago as planting delays threaten to reduce U.S. crop
yields, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.3
cent to 0.4 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may
open up $2 to $2.50 per 2,000 pounds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
