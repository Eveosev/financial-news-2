Ivory Coast  plans to reinforce
security along the border with neighboring  Liberia  to prevent
the return of Liberian mercenaries to its territory, the
government said.  Prime Minister Guillaume Soro invites the international
community to help secure the border, according to an e-mailed
statement yesterday from government spokesman Patrick Achi.  At least 220 civilians were killed in western Ivory Coast
by militias and Liberian mercenaries who had backed former
President Laurent Gbagbo as they retreated to Liberia, according
to the statement. The mercenaries fled the country after forces
loyal to President  Alassane Ouattara  captured Gbagbo following a
civil war.  The Ivorian Defense Ministry on May 10 put the number of
dead at 174.  The government also urged almost 160,000 Ivorian refugees
in Liberia to return to  Ivory Coast , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
