Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said he’s “very
sad and upset” about the arrest in  New York  of International
Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn on
sexual-assault charges.  “He’s a good friend of mine,” Juncker told reporters in
Brussels late yesterday after a meeting of finance ministers.
“I didn’t like the pictures I saw on the TV this morning. It
was deeply sad and traumatic. But Mr. Strauss-Kahn is in the
hands of the American justice. It’s not up to us to comment on
this, but it makes me deeply, deeply sad.”  Juncker said ministers didn’t discuss the arrest during
their talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
