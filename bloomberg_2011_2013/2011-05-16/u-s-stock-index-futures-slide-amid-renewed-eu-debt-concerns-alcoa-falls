U.S. stock futures fell, signaling
that the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may extend its two-week
retreat, as Greece prepared to ask for a bigger bailout amid
renewed sovereign-debt concern in Europe.  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  sank 9.3 percent in early New York trading
after  NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and IntercontinentalExchange Inc.
withdrew their offer for the operator of the New York Stock
Exchange.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  led banks
lower in German trading. Lowe’s Cos. slid in early New York
trading after the retailer posted earnings that missed analysts’
estimates.  S&P 500  futures expiring in June lost 0.3 percent to
1,329.3 at 7:27 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures fell 0.4 percent to 12,511, while Nasdaq-100 Index
futures slipped 0.2 percent 2,365.5.  “Markets are concerned by the loss of economic momentum
and the resurgence of risk in the euro zone,” said  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities Ltd. in
London. “It is a market that has good fundamental support in
the background, but what’s lacking right now is some stronger
lead that will take the market upward.”  Greece  will plead for European governments and the
International Monetary Fund to boost its 110 billion-euro ($155
billion) bailout today in talks clouded by the arrest of IMF
Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn. European finance
ministers will also discuss the approval of 78 billion euros in
Portuguese aid at their Brussels meeting.  Strauss-Kahn Charges  Strauss-Kahn, 62, is awaiting his first court appearance on
attempted rape charges after an alleged attack on a 32-year-old
female maid at a Sofitel hotel in midtown Manhattan on May 14,
according to the New York Police Department. He has denied the
charges and will plead not guilty, his lawyer Benjamin Brafman
said.  The S&P 500 has lost 1.9 percent so far this month, led by
commodity producers, after inflation reports spurred speculation
that global interest rates will rise. The gauge has still
climbed 6.4 percent this year as government stimulus measures
and better-than-estimated corporate earnings boosted confidence
in the economic recovery.  NYSE plunged 9.3 percent to $37.07 in early New York
trading after Nasdaq and ICE withdrew their rival offer for the
company following discussions with the Antitrust Division of the
 U.S. Department of Justice . Germany’s Deutsche Boerse AG agreed
to buy NYSE in February. Nasdaq’s shares were suspended pending
the announcement.  Goldman Sachs lost 0.7 percent to $140.47 in Germany, while
Citigroup fell 1.1 percent to $41.08.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  slid
0.3 percent to $43.01.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  declined 1.2 percent to $16.89 in Germany, while
 ConocoPhillips (COP) , the nation’s third-biggest oil company, dropped
0.2 percent to $71.27.  Commodities Slide  Copper fell as much as 0.8 percent in London and crude oil
dropped below $98 a barrel in New York as funds cut their bets
on higher commodity prices by 15 percent on mounting concern
that global growth is slowing.  The funds held a net 1.23 million contracts across 18 U.S.
commodity futures as of May 10, the lowest since July, data from
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The net-long
position in crude oil slumped 13 percent in a week, while for
copper it fell 59 percent and for silver 23 percent.  Lowe’s sank 3 percent to $24.98 in early  New York  trading
after the second-largest U.S. home improvement retailer reported
a 5.7 percent decline in first-quarter profit to 34 cents a
share, as sagging home values crimped demand for large
remodeling projects. That trailed the average analyst estimate
of 36 cents a share, according to a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
