The  European Investment Bank  signed
loans worth 650 million euros ($918 million) for Italy’s Fiat
venture in the Balkan state and Serbian small- and medium-sized
firms, the European Union’s lending arm said.  Fiat SpA (F) ’s venture in Serbia will get 500 million euros to
finance its investments in “modernization and expansion of
production capacity of an automotive plant in Kragujevac,
Serbia,” the EIB said today in an e-mailed statement.  An additional 150 million euros will finance small- and
medium-sized companies and their projects “which are considered
to be the driving force of the Serbian economy,” the lender
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
