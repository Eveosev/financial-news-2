Ken Rosewall, who won eight Grand
Slam singles tennis titles, is in good condition after being
admitted to the stroke unit of an Italian hospital while
attending the Rome Masters, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.  Rosewall, a 76-year-old Australian, may be kept under
observation for 10 days after “suffering a suspected
disturbance of the brain circuit,” the Herald said, citing
emergency room doctors it didn’t identify. Rosewall had not
suffered any heart or brain damage, the Herald cited his wife,
Wilma, as saying.  Rosewall won 132 singles titles during a 30-year career,
including four Australian Opens, two French Opens and two U.S.
Opens. He was the runner-up at Wimbledon four times and was
named to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980.  He had been invited to the Rome Masters tournament to
receive a golden racket presented annually to former players,
the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
