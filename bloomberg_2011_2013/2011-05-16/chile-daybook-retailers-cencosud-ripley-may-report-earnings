Retailers Cencosud SA and Ripley Corp
SA may report first-quarter earnings at times to be advised.  EQUITIES:
*The Ipsa index fell 0.3 percent to 4,851.01.
*Besalco SA rose 0.7 percent to 945.2 pesos. The construction
company was reiterated at “buy” at Santiago-based brokerage
Larrain Vial SA with a price estimate of 1,130 pesos.
*Empresas La Polar SA retreated 1 percent to 2,745.9 pesos. The
department-store operator, which caters to middle- and lower-
income segments and sells via  consumer credit , led declines
among interest rate-sensitive stocks after the central bank
increase borrowing costs more than economists estimated.
*Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones SA fell 1.3 percent to
9,060.7 pesos. The mobile telephone operator was rated
“underweight” at the brokerage unit of Santiago-based Banco de
Credito e Inversiones.
*SACI Falabella rose 0.2 percent to 5,079.9 pesos. The retailer
had first-quarter net income of 95.7 billion pesos ($205
million), a 43 percent increase from 66.8 billion pesos a year
earlier. That compares with an 85.4 billion-peso average
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  MARKETS:
* Chile ’s peso retreated as commodities pared gains and stocks
fell, eroding investor appetite for riskier, emerging-market
assets. The peso slid 0.3 percent to 467.56 per  U.S. dollar .
*Interest-rate swaps rose after the central bank raised
borrowing costs more than estimated. The two-year interest-rate
swap yield rose 5 basis points to 5.64 percent.
*Chile’s two-year breakeven rate, which reflects views of
average price increases, fell 9 basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 3.45 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
