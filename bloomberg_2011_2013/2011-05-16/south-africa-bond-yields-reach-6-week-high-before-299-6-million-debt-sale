South African bond yields soared to
the highest in six weeks, pushing up the government’s borrowing
costs before tomorrow’s debt auction, after the central bank
said inflation will breach its target range.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  is offering 2.1 billion
rand ($299 million) of bonds maturing in 2021 and 2036 at its
weekly auction, it said on its Bloomberg page. The secondary
market yield on the 2021 bonds on May 13 rose to 8.61 percent,
the highest on a closing basis since April 4 and 26 basis
points, or 0.26 percentage point, higher than at the previous
auction on May 10. The yield fell seven basis points to 8.54
percent by 2:34 p.m. in Johannesburg today.  Inflation will breach the upper range of the 3 percent to 6
percent target range in the fourth quarter, peaking at 6.3
percent in the first quarter of 2012, the central bank’s
Monetary Policy Committee said on May 12 after holding its
benchmark interest rate at 5.5 percent. The MPC will be
“vigilant” in monitoring inflation, Governor Gill Marcus said.  “Last week’s MPC has not given investors the kind of
guidance they may have hoped for with the central bank’s
increased inflation forecasts, only adding to the pressure on
bonds,” Tradition Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-
based Quinten Bertenshaw said in a research note. “In the near
term, bonds may come under further pressure.”  South Africa ’s inflation rate, due to be reported tomorrow,
probably advanced to 4.4 percent in April, from 4.1 percent the
month before and 3.7 percent in February, according to the
median estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The rand depreciated 4.5 percent against the dollar last
week, its worst weekly performance in a year, and slipped as
much as 0.5 percent today to 7.0587, its weakest level in almost
two months, today.  “Late last week bonds began to respond to the weakness of
the rand and the general rotation away from the risk trade,”
Tradition wrote. “Strong inflows which had been a
characteristic of the  bond market  in recent weeks have started
to lighten up.”  The bond auction starts at 11 a.m., and the results will be
announced at about 11:30 a.m., the Reserve Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
