Hungary â€™s ruling coalition may
retroactively slash or take back pensions from early retirees,
 Vilaggazdasag  reported, citing a constitutional amendment
submitted to parliament last week.  The government may cut or take back pensions from people
who retired before the official age of 62 if parliament approves
the proposal, the newspaper said.  The new legislation may affect around 1.5 million people,
Vilaggazdasag said. Those deemed fit to work might receive aid
from the government until they find employment, the newspaper
added.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
