Germany ’s opposition Social
Democrats, whose support  Chancellor Angela Merkel  needs to pass
energy legislation, are calling for the country to ditch nuclear
power by 2020, Handelsblatt said, citing a position paper.  The party wants to raise taxes on utilities and reduce the
market share of Germany’s four biggest power companies, EON AG,
 RWE AG (RWE) , Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG and Vattenfall AB, the
newspaper reported. The party’s national leadership plans to
sign off on the plan at a meeting today,  Handelsblatt  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
