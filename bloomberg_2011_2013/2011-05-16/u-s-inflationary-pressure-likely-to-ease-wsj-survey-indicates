U.S. inflationary pressure at its
present level is transitory and price increases will probably
slow in the course of next year, according to the Wall Street
Journalâ€™s latest monthly survey of economists.  On average, the 55 economists in the survey expect the 3.2
percent year-on-year increase in consumer prices reported by the
Labor Department on May 13 to fall to 3 percent in the course of
this year and to stay below 2.5 percent through 2012.  Of the 52 economists who responded to a question on food
and energy prices, 36 said the recent quickening of inflation in
those areas will be temporary.  The economists said gross domestic product will grow by a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.2 percent this quarter and
accelerate to 3.4 percent by the fourth quarter; unemployment,
however, is seen falling slowly, to 8.4 percent by the end of
the year and 7.7 percent by the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
