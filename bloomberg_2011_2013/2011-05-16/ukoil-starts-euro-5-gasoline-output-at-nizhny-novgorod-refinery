OAO Lukoil started output of so-
called Euro-5 standard gasoline at its refinery in  Nizhny
Novgorod , its  largest  plant in  Russia .  The refinery, east of Moscow, produces only Euro-5 and
Euro-4 standard gasoline after work was completed on a catalytic
cracker, an official said from Moscow, declining to be named in
line with company policy.  Euro-4 standard gasoline contains no more than 50 parts per
million of sulfur. Euro-5, with a 10 parts-per-million limit, is
the strictest  European Union  fuel category. A lower sulfur
content reduces pollution.  Lukoil expects to produce about 3.1 million metric tons of
gasoline at Nizhny Novgorod this year, up 48 percent from last
year, according to an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
