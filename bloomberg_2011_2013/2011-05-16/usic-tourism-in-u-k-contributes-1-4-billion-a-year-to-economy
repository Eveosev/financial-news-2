Tourists visiting U.K. music
festivals and concerts contribute at least 864 million pounds
($1.4 billion) a year to the economy, highlighting the need for
a live music tourism strategy, an industry group said.  Live music events across the country attract 7.7 million
attendances by domestic and overseas tourists, who collectively
spend 1.4 billion pounds during their trips, according to a
report today from  UK Music , a London-based group that includes
songwriters, managers and record companies. Though just 5
percent of music tourists come from abroad, they contribute 18
percent of total spending.  The report, which follows one by the government identifying
the U.K.’s creative industries as drivers of growth, urges the
adoption of a strategy to lure overseas music tourists. It also
recommends the promotion of music strengths of various regions
and the formation of a body to promote live music tourism within
the country. UK Music estimates 19,700 full-time jobs rely on
the contribution from music tourists.  “Music provides a huge boost to U.K. tourism,” said
Feargal Sharkey, UK Music’s chief executive officer. “It drives
growth, it sustains thousands of jobs across all region and
enhances our lives.”  Government should also work to address concerns over the
U.K. visa system for overseas performers and exempt small venues
from certain licensing regulations, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
