Isnaputra Iskandar, a Jakarta-based
analyst with  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , comments on expectations for
Indonesia’s coal industry in a note today after a six-day
marketing trip to the U.K. and Europe.  “Investors, in our opinion, remain positive on the
Indonesian coal sector, and have exposure to the sector either
directly (buying Indonesian coal stocks directly) or indirectly
(buying stocks that are not listed in Indonesia but have
exposure to Indonesia).  “Investors agree with our view of the potential tight coal
market situation over the next five years on a combination of
strong demand in India and  China  and potential supply disruption
in  South Africa , Australia and Indonesia.  “Investors like the strong domestic coal story, but do not
understand why the government did not step up to secure domestic
supply. Although the government’s track record suggests no
intervention in the sector, investors still think of the
potential risk which could hurt the overall industry.  “Investors also think that the difficulty in getting the
necessary permits/licenses could have an impact on the potential
supply of coal from  Indonesia  in the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
