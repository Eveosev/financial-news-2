The Philippine peso dropped to its
weakest level in almost a month ahead of today’s March overseas
remittances report, which may show the amount of funds sent home
by workers abroad cooled.  Growth in repatriated funds slowed to 6.2 percent in
February from a year earlier, compared with 7.6 percent in
January, according to the latest central bank data. The pace of
increase may have eased to around 5 percent in March, said
Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . Asian
currencies also dropped as  Greece  seeks to boost a 110 billion
euro ($155 billion) aid package at a meeting of finance chiefs
today. Three-year bond yields were unchanged.  “Remittances will remain resilient but growth will
probably slacken because of the already high base,” Rao said.
“Risk aversion ahead of the European finance ministers meeting
is also a theme for the region.”  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 43.373 per dollar as of 10:37
a.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
43.425, the weakest level since April 19.  The Bureau of the Treasury will auction 9 billion pesos
($207 million) of bills due in three months to a year at 1 p.m.
today. The central bank will gauge whether its two consecutive
interest-rate increases have anchored price expectations,
Assistant Governor Cyd Amador said on May 13.  The yield on the 6.25 percent note due January 2014 was
unchanged at 4.9 percent, according to Tradition Financial
Services prices.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas raised the overnight borrowing
rate by a quarter of a percentage point each at the March 24 and
May 5 meetings to the current 4.5 percent. The next policy
decision is on June 16.  To contact the reporter for this story:
