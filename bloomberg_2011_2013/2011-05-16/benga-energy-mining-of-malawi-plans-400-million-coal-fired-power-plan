Benga Energy and Mining, a closely-
held Malawian company, plans to build a $400 million coal-fired
power plant in the country’s northern Karonga District, Benga
Managing Director James Londomu Manda said.  The company is doing a feasibility study on the costs of
the project, Manda said by phone today from Blantyre, the
commercial capital.  “It’s envisioned that the Bengu power plant will generate
between 200 megawatts and 250 megawatts of power,” he said.  Currently, Electricity Supply Corp. of Malawi generates
about 287 megawatts, while total demand is more than 300
megawatts, according to the state-owned power company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
