Japan ’s 10-year bonds fell for a
third day as the yen weakened and local stocks reversed losses,
sapping demand for safer assets.  Bonds also dropped on speculation investors will try to
boost yields to lock in a higher coupon for an  auction  of five-
year notes this week. Benchmark 10-year yields rebounded after
touching a six-month low yesterday.  “People can’t keep buying bonds as yields have come down a
lot,” said Toshiyuki Kurabayashi, assistant manager in Tokyo at
the fixed-income division of Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management
Co., a unit of Japan’s largest lender by assets. “They’d want a
0.5 percent coupon for the five-year sale. That should weigh on
bonds.”  The yield on the 1.1 percent bond due March 2021 rose 1.5
basis points to 1.15 percent at 3:06 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
price fell 0.132 yen to 99.558 yen. The yield reached 1.105
percent yesterday, the lowest since Nov. 24. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery slipped 0.10 to
140.60 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The yen weakened to as low
as 81.46 per dollar from 80.79. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
rose 0.1 percent after falling 0.6 percent earlier in the day.  Bond Sales  The  Ministry of Finance  sold 400 billion yen ($4.92
billion) of 40-year bonds today. The sale drew bids worth 3.13
times the amount on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.06 times at the previous auction in February.
The ministry will sell 2.4 trillion yen of five-year notes on
May 19.  The benchmark 40-year yield gained three basis points to
2.225 percent, while the five-year yield rose half a basis point
to 0.44 percent.  Losses in bonds were limited before a report forecast to
show the nation’s gross domestic product contracted. The data
may pressure the central bank to signal further easing at the
close of its two-day policy meeting on May 20.  Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said today the
nation’s economy has been in a “very severe” state since a
record earthquake on March 11.  “There’s a risk GDP data will come out weaker than
expected,” said Akira Terabayashi, a researcher in Tokyo at
Norinchukin Research Institute Co., the central bank for Japan’s
agricultural, forestry and fishery cooperatives. “The flight to
quality continues to happen, and bonds are being supported.”  Japan’s economy contracted an annualized 1.9 percent in the
three months ended March 31 after shrinking 1.3 percent in the
previous quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists
before the data’s release on May 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
