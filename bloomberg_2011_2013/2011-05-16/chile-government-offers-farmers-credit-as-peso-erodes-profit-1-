Chile ’s government will offer farmers
$400 million of loans with “favorable”  interest rates  to help
agricultural exporters cope with  Latin America ’s best performing
currency in the past year, said Finance Minister Felipe Larrain.  The credit will be offered through state-owned Banco del
Estado de Chile to help replace used equipment and expand cattle
purchases and planting, Larrain told reporters today. The loans
will have repayment grace periods and amortization coinciding
with harvest cycles.  Chile’s peso has strengthened 14 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  in the past 12 months, more than the other six major
Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as the price of
its major export, copper, rises and borrowing costs increase.
The government is also encouraging farmers to use currency
hedging mechanisms offered by Banco del Estado, Larrain said.  “This is an international problem and many countries that
are doing well are complaining,” he said. “It has affected
Chile’s agriculture sector and we are taking various measures.”  The peso declined 0.8 percent to 471.44 per dollar at 2:31
p.m. New York time from 467.56 on May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
