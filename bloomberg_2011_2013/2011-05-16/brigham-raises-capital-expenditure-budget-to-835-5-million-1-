Brigham Exploration Co. (BEXP) , the oil and
gas producer that tripled proved reserves of crude last year,
raised this year’s planned capital spending 21 percent to
accelerate oil drilling in  Montana  and  North Dakota .  Brigham will increase its spending to $835.5 million and
put three more rigs to work in the Williston Basin by July, six
months ahead of schedule, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
Bud Brigham said today in a statement. Raising the number of
rigs to 10 from 7 will allow the company to start 8 additional
wells this year, Brigham.  Brigham’s first-quarter Williston Basin production more
than doubled from a year earlier to the equivalent of 10,000
barrels of oil a day. Crude oil fell 98 cents to $98.67 today on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , 41 percent higher than a year
ago. Brigham expects to update its  full-year production forecast 
of 12,300 barrels of oil per day after the end of this quarter.  The company said today it agreed to acquire additional
leases in the basin, bringing its net acreage there to 378,100,
up from 365,000 as of  Feb. 25 .  Brigham also announced plans to sell $250 million of senior
notes to fund spending.  The announcement was made before regular trading began on
U.S. markets. Brigham shares fell 19 cents to $26.94 at 8:01
a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
