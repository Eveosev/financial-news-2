The owners of the  National Hockey
League ’s Atlanta Thrashers have begun negotiations to sell the
financially troubled team to Winnipeg-based True North Sports &
Entertainment, leading to a possible move to Manitoba, the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution  reported .  The newspaper, citing a person it didn’t identify, said no
deal has been reached and it didn’t know how long the two sides
have been talking. They began discussions only after a new owner
in Atlanta couldn’t be found, the Journal-Constitution said.  Rob Koch, a spokesman for the Thrashers, and  Scott Brown , a
spokesman for True North, declined to comment on the report.  NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has said the Thrashers would
only move if no owners can be found to keep the team in
 Georgia ’s capital city.  “It comes down to the ownership,” Bettman said on NHL
Radio on May 12. “If you get to that position, where somebody’s
not prepared to own the club there anymore and you can’t find a
prospective purchaser, then you’re really between a rock and a
hard place.”  The NHL hasn’t had a team in Winnipeg since the Jets moved
to Phoenix in 1996. The Thrashers would be the second NHL team
to leave Atlanta, following the Flames, who were sold to a group
of Canadian businessmen and relocated to Calgary in 1980.  The Thrashers, who have made the playoffs once in their 11-
year history, may be sold for $110 million, Forbes magazine
reported on May 2. The magazine valued the franchise at $135
million in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
