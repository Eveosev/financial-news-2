Webmedia Group ,  Estonia ’s largest
computer software maker, entered the Finnish market by acquiring
CCC Corporation Oy for an undisclosed sum.  The acquisition of the Oulunsalo-based CCC will increase
group revenue to an estimated 40 million euros ($56 million)
this year, with an operating profit of 4 million euros, the
companies said in an e-mailed statement in Tallinn today. The
group aims to double its revenue in three years, helped by CCC’s
expertise in industrial production and materials management
products.  “CCC will introduce different Webmedia solutions to the
Finnish market, with the initial focus on the Webmedia eHealth
Platform and StaffLogic, a workforce optimization and advanced
scheduling platform,” the companies said. “Both companies are
relying the same core technologies: SharePoint, .NET, Java and
open source, and the shared competence enables the smooth
introduction and support of Webmedia solutions.”  Enterprise Investors,  Poland ’s largest private equity fund,
bought a 36 percent stake in Webmedia last July for 7 million
euros. Webmedia estimates it has supplied about half of Estonian
public administration e-solutions and portals, utilizing the
Baltic nation’s success in the nationwide use of information
technology services such as internet banking or  E-school , a
solution used by almost half of 1.3 million Estonians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
