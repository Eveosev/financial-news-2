U.S. nuclear-power production fell
1.6 percent as operators shut reactors in  Massachusetts , North
Carolina and Florida, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide decreased 1,256 megawatts from
May 13 to 75,954 megawatts, or 75 percent of capacity, according
to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-
five of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  shut the 685-megawatt Pilgrim 1 reactor after
it reached 14 percent of capacity on May 13. The unit
unexpectedly tripped offline on May 9 as it powered up following
a refueling outage that began on April 18. The plant is located
on the Atlantic coast 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) east of Plymouth,
Massachusetts.  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  closed the 938-megawatt Brunswick 1
plant in  North Carolina . It was operating at full power on May
13. The 937-megawatt Brunswick 2, another unit at the site, is
operating at full capacity.  The plant is located at Cape Fear on the Atlantic Ocean,
130 miles south of Raleigh.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  idled the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie 2
reactor in Florida. The unit was operating at 100 percent of
capacity on May 13, having just powered up from a refueling
outage.  Another reactor at the plant, the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie
1, boosted output to full power from 90 percent on May 13. The
plant is located about 45 miles north of Palm Beach.  Pennsylvania Plant  PPL Corp. (PPL)  slowed its 1,149-megawatt Susquehanna 1 reactor
in Pennsylvania to 33 percent of capacity from full power on May
13. The 1,140-megawatt Susquehanna 2 unit is shut. The plant is
located in Luzerne County, 50 miles northwest of Allentown.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  reduced power at the 882-megawatt Quad
Cities 2 reactor on the  Illinois  side of the Mississippi River
to 85 percent of capacity from 100 percent on May 13. Another
unit at the site, the 882-megawatt Quad Cities 1, is shut. The
plant is located about 20 miles northeast of Moline.  Exelon slowed the 1,164-megawatt  Byron 1 reactor  in
Illinois to 92 percent of capacity from 100 percent on May 13.
The unit returned on April 25 from a refueling and maintenance
outage. Another unit at the plant 85 miles west of  Chicago , the
1,136-megawatt Byron 2, is operating at full capacity.  Turkey Point  NextEra started the 693-megawatt Turkey Point 4 Reactor in
 Florida  and it was operating it at 4 percent of capacity. The
reactor was shut for refueling and maintenance from March 21 to
May 2, then closed again on May 6. The plant is located about 20
miles south of Miami.  Exelon boosted the 1,152-megawatt Braidwood 2 in Illinois
to 83 percent of capacity from 37 percent on May 13 after a
refueling outage from April 18 to May 12.  Another reactor on the plant 54 miles southwest of Chicago,
the 1,178-megawatt Braidwood 1 unit, is operating at full power.  Entergy increased output at the 843-megawatt Arkansas
Nuclear 1 reactor to full power from 46 percent on May 13. The
 Little Rock  Transmission Operating Center asked the plant to
reduce power on April 25 after a storm knocked out a 500
kilovolt line.  The 995-megawatt Arkansas Nuclear 2 reactor is operating at
full power. The plant is located 65 miles northwest of Little
Rock.  Near New Orleans  Entergy raised output at the 1,157-megawatt Waterford 3
reactor to 75 percent of capacity from 51 percent on May 13. It
returned from a refueling and maintenance stoppage that began
April 6.  Waterford is on the  Mississippi River  about 25 miles west
of downtown New Orleans.  The  Nebraska  Public Power District increased power from the
830-megawatt Cooper reactor in Nebraska to full power from 78
percent of capacity on May 13. It returned from a refueling and
maintenance outage that began March 14 and was at 98 percent on
May 12.  The unit is near Brownville on the Missouri River 64 miles
south of Omaha. Nebraska Public Power is based in Columbus,
Nebraska.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
