Czech equities declined, sending the
main index to its lowest in almost three weeks, as investors
shunned risk on concern European finance ministers may fail to
quell speculation about  Greece ’s debt restructuring.  The PX gauge of 15 companies fell 0.7 to 1,256.5 at 4:28
p.m. in Prague, its lowest close since April 26. Austria’s  Erste
Group Bank AG (RBAG)  declined for a third day, losing 1.2 percent to
821 koruna.  Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the biggest Czech oil refiner, sank
1.7 percent to 184 koruna, after a 2.8 percent gain on May 13.  Equities tumbled worldwide earlier today and oil snapped a
two-day advance as Greece prepares to ask for an increase in its
110 billion-euro ($155 billion) financial lifeline from European
governments and the  International Monetary Fund . European stocks
pared the loss after the Czech market closed and U.S. stocks
advanced as mining companies rallied.  To contact the reporter on this story:
