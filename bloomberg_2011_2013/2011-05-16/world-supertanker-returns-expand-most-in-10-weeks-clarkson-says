Rental income from supertankers on
single-voyage charters last week grew the most in 10 weeks after
fuel costs fell, according to  Clarkson  Research Services Ltd.  Returns from very large crude carriers rose 18 percent to
$21,837 a day, according to data published on the website of the
research company, a unit of the world’s largest shipbroker. The
increase was the biggest since the week ended March 6.  While the cost of charters holds steady, a “substantial”
fuel price drop is cutting ship owners’ biggest cost, Clarkson
wrote in a report on its website.  Bunker fuel used to power ships fell 1.7 percent to $640 a
metric ton last week, prices from 25 ports worldwide gathered by
Bloomberg show. The cost declined 3.4 percent the week before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
