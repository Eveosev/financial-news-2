Japanese and Australian stock futures
dropped as Greece sought more bailout funds and slower-than-
expected manufacturing growth in the  New York  region fueled
concerns about the global economic recovery.  American depositary receipts of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc.,  Japan ’s second-biggest publicly traded bank, fell
0.9 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo after Moody’s
said Greek default losses may “far exceed” bank loans. Those
of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker, slid 0.6
percent. ADRs of National Australia Bank Ltd., Australia’s
fourth-largest lender, slid 0.2 percent.  “Optimism on the  U.S. economy  is receding and Greek
financial issues remain uncertain,” Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “Investors
will likely keep shifting their funds to safe bonds or cash from
risk assets like stocks.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,520 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with 9,565
in  Singapore . The futures were bid in the pre-market at 9,530 in
 Osaka , Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index was rose 0.1 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. In New York, the index lost 0.6 percent to 1,329.47
yesterday as Greece sought additional bailout funds and a report
showed manufacturing growth in the New York region cooled.  European Financial Issues  European finance chiefs endorsed a 78 billion-euro ($111
billion) bailout for Portugal. Authorities stepped up pressure
on  Greece  to sell assets and deepen spending cuts to win an
increase of its 110 billion-euro ($156 billion) aid package and
more time to repay the loans. In deliberations clouded by the
absence of International Monetary Fund Managing Director
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn ,  Europe ’s rich countries also weighed
whether to make holders of Greek bonds assume some losses.  A Greek default would be “highly destabilizing” for banks,
causing losses that “far exceed” the size of their loans and
investments there, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
European banks would lose 34.4 billion euros ($48.6 billion) in
a worst-case scenario, less than the total 95 billion euros of
outstanding Greek assets they hold, Moody’s said in a note
yesterday, citing public and non-public data for 97 lenders.  Manufacturing in New York  Stocks also declined as manufacturing in the New York
region expanded at a slower pace than anticipated in May as the
cost of raw materials surged. The Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s general economic index fell to 11.9 from a one-year high
of 21.7 in April, the central bank reported yesterday.
Economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected it would drop to
19.6, according to the median forecast. Readings greater than
zero signal growth.  Crude oil for June delivery declined 2.3 percent to $97.37
a barrel in New York yesterday, the lowest settlement since May
6, on speculation that a slowing economy may reduce demand for
commodities. Gold futures for June delivery dropped 0.2 percent
to settle at 1,490.60 an ounce in New York yesterday as a
decline in energy costs eroded demand for raw materials
including precious metals.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.7 percent by the  S&P
500  and 1.6 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.3 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Today, 26 of the 1,022 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 638 companies
in the MSCI index that have reported results for the latest
quarter, 246 have exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 247 have
missed them, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
