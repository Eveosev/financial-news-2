Two members of  Brazil ’s lower house
called for a public hearing to discuss ethanol policies imposed
in April to fight soaring prices after supplies of the renewable
fuel waned.  Sarney Filho, from the  Green Party , plans to debate the
impact of reducing the minimum ethanol blend requirement at the
May 19 hearing, the government said today in a  statement .  Standard gasoline sold in Brazil contains 25 percent
ethanol. A presidential decree announced April 28 reduced the
lowest permitted blending rate to 18 percent from 20 percent  Antonio Carlos Mendes Thame, from the Brazilian  Social
Democratic Party , said the government should provide sugar-cane
mills with incentives and better access to credit to stimulate
production, according to the statement.  “If we want the car fleet to continue growing, we need to
increase the production of cane,” he said.  Prices of anhydrous ethanol reached a record 2.73 reais
($1.67) a liter on April 20, after mills in the south shut down
production for the rainy season, according to Piracicaba-based
research institute Centro de Estudos Avancados em Economia
Aplicada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
