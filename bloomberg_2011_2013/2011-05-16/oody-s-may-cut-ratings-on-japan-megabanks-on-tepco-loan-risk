Moody’s Investors Service may cut the
debt ratings of lenders including  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. (8306)  should they forgive loans made to  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.
before the country’s record earthquake and tsunami.  “About 2 trillion yen of loans to Tepco from megabanks and
life insurance companies offered before the March quake would
virtually fall to a default status if the financial institutions
were to write them off,” Moody’s analysts led by Tetsuya Yamamoto, Tokyo-based vice president of the financial
institutions group, said in a report today.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters on May
13 “people won’t support” using taxpayer money for Tepco, as
the utility is known, unless banks waive some loans made before
the record March 11 earthquake and tsunami crippled its
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  Edano’s remarks “made the financial market fragile,”
Moody’s said.  Japan ’s three biggest banks including  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316)  and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  had
combined loans of at least 381 billion yen extended to Tokyo
Electric as of March 31 last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
