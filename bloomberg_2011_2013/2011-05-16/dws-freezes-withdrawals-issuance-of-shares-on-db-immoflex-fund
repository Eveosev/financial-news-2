Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s DWS Investment
GmbH unit has frozen the withdrawal and issuance of shares from
its DB ImmoFlex fund.  “Due to continuing unit redemptions, liquidity reserves
held by the db ImmoFlex are no longer sufficient to service all
redemption requests,” the company said today in an e-mailed
statement, citing “extraordinary circumstances.”  Servicing further redemptions in current market conditions
would require disposing of assets “at unacceptable discounts,”
the statement said.  DWS said the decision to suspend share issuance and
redemption won’t affect the intrinsic value of the fund’s
assets. DB ImmoFlex had a volume of 259 million euros ($368
million) as of April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
