Tanzania is aiming to cut its
dependence on donors to a maximum 10 percent by 2015, The
 Guardian newspaper  reported, citing the chief secretary to
Cabinet and Public Service head Philemon Luhanjo.  Current donor dependence is 25 percent, the Dar es Salaam-
based newspaper said. The government will reduce dependence by
seeking to boost domestic revenue, tightening public expenditure
and fighting corruption, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
