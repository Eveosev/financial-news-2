The  Kenya  Agricultural Research
Institute has introduced rust disease-resistant wheat varieties
that may boost crop yields, an official said.  The research center gave two wheat varieties, Robin and Ego
10, to Kenya’s seed company to reproduce, Peter Njau, the head
of the Durable Rust Resistance Project, said in a phone
interview today from Nairobi, the capital. The seeds
successfully completed trials done from 2007 to 2009, he said.  “This year we have forwarded 3 tons of seed to Kenya Seed
for multiplication,” he said. “This will bring out about 60 to
90 tons by next year.”  Farmers can lose up to 40 percent of their crop to the
disease and measures to contain it have increased the cost of
production by about 30 percent, according to Njau. The disease
was first discovered in  Uganda  in 1999 and was later found in
Kenya in 2001 and in  Ethiopia  in 2003. It comes in two forms;
stem rust and stripe rust disease. Wheat rust pathogen enters
the stems of the plant, destroying vascular tissue and causing
it to fall over, Njau said.  “Controlling the disease is expensive and therefore small
scale farmers are most affected, since most of them cannot
afford the expensive fungicides,” he said.  Kenya produces about 350,000 metric tons of wheat annually,
according to David Nyameino, the chief executive officer of the
Kenya Cereal Growers Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
