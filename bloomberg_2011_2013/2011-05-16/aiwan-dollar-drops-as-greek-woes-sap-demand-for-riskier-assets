Taiwan ’s dollar dropped on concern
 Greece ’s debt crisis will sap demand for riskier assets, making
it harder for emerging markets to attract funds.  European finance ministers meet today to discuss further
support for Greece that may include new loans or an extension of
debt maturities. Global funds sold $228 million more Taiwanese
stocks than they bought today, according to exchange data.  “The problem in  Europe  led to U.S. dollar strength
today,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader at
the Union Bank of Taiwan.  The  Taiwan dollar  fell 0.4 percent to NT$28.888 against the
greenback as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.920 earlier, the weakest level since
April 27. Tong forecast the currency may fall to NT$29 this
week.  The local dollar was 0.1 percent weaker one minute before
the end of the trading and extended decline on suspected
intervention by the central bank, according to two traders who
refused to be identified as the authority doesn’t disclose such
details.  “Some people are saying the authority won’t let the
closing price breach NT$28.50,” said Tong.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 1
percent note due January 2016, the most-traded government debt,
was 1.105 percent from 1.102 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
