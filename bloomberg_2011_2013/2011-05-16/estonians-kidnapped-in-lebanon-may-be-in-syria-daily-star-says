Seven Estonians kidnapped in Lebanon
in March are believed to have been transferred to  Syria , the
 Daily Star  reported, citing two unidentified security officials.  The seven are thought to have been transferred to Syria
based on information obtained by a joint Lebanese, Estonian, and
French police investigation, the Beirut-based newspaper said.  A video broadcast last month on several Lebanese and Arab
news channels that was uploaded to YouTube showed the kidnapped
men appealing for help. The video was also sent to Lebanon
Files, a news portal, which one of the security officials said
originated in Damascus, the newspaper reported.  The Estonians were kidnapped after crossing into Lebanon
from Syria on bicycles, Lebanonâ€™s official National News Agency
has said. The Lebanese military said they entered the country as
tourists.  A previously unheard of group, Haraket Al-Nahda Wal-Islah
or Movement for Renewal and Reform, has claimed responsibility
for the kidnapping and demanded an unspecified ransom to free
the Estonians in two e-mails sent to Lebanon Files, the
newspaper reported.  -- Editor: James Kraus  To contact the reporters on this story:
