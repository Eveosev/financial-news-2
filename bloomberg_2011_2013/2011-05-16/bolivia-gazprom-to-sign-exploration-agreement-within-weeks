Bolivia  and OAO Gazprom may sign an
accord within weeks to explore for hydrocarbons in the Acero
block in the nationâ€™s southeast, the head of the state-owned
natural-gas company said.  Gazprom, as well as TecPetrol SA and state company YPFB
Chaco, also plan to join  Total SA (FP)  to help develop the Aquio and
Ipati oil blocks in eastern Bolivia, Carlos Villegas, chief
executive officer of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
Bolivianos, said today at a news conference. Total will hold 50
percent of the project, while Gazprom and TecPetrol will own 20
percent each and YPFB Chaco will control 10 percent, he said.  Bolivia will award oil and natural-gas exploration
contracts this year for the first time since 2006, Villegas said
in an interview May 1. Total,  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , BG Group Plc and
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  plan to invest $3 billion in gas plants
and to drill 10 wells by 2014, he said at the time.  "We are now secure that the investment plan for development
of Ipati and Aquio will be a reality," Villegas said today.  The agreement to develop the two blocks needs approval by
congress and requires investments of $850 million, he said.
Total said May 12 that its local unit found gas and condensate
in a well at the Aquio block.  To contact the reporter on this story:
