William Ackman ’s Pershing Square
Capital Management LP sold all its shares in  Target Corp. (TGT) , two
years after the discounter’s shareholders rejected a board slate
nominated by the hedge-fund manager.  Pershing sold 7.4 million shares, reducing its position to
zero, as of March 31, according to a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission today. Minneapolis-based
Target has 689.1 million shares outstanding.  Ackman, 45, nominated himself and four other candidates to
the Target board in March 2009, saying the directors lacked
expertise in credit cards, real estate and groceries, and failed
to position the company for the recession. Ackman at one point
controlled 9.5 percent of Target, the second-biggest U.S.
discount retailer after  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)   Target fell 93 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $50.34 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have advanced 16 percent this year.  In 2009, Ackman apologized to clients who had money in New
York-based Pershing Square after it lost $1.8 billion on its
Target investment.  That year, Target and Ackman traded barbs and criticisms
almost daily in a flurry of press releases and securities
filings. The company said Ackman ran for a board seat to promote
a plan to form a real estate investment trust backed by the land
under its stores, a proposal it had rejected earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
