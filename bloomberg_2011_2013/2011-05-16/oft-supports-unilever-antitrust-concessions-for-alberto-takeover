The U.K. antitrust regulator endorsed
Unilever’s concessions for its takeover of soap-maker Alberto-
Culver Co., seeking views from market participants for final
approval, the U.K. Office of Fair Trading said today.  “The OFT considers that the proposed undertakings offered
by Unilever are clear cut and appropriate to remedy, mitigate or
prevent the competition concerns identified in the decision,”
the OFT said in a statement.  Unilever offered concessions to the OFT in March to gain
approval for its $3.7 billion takeover of  Alberto-Culver Co. (ACV)  The
Dutch manufacturer offered to sell Alberto-Culver’s bar soaps
business, which includes the brands Simple, Cidal and Wright’s,
to address competition concerns, the OFT said in a  statement  on
its website.  The takeover would be Unilever’s biggest purchase in a
decade.  Melrose Park , Illinois-based Alberto-Culver makes also
VO5, Nexxus and TRESemme hair-care products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
