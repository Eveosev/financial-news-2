OAO Gazprom increased sales of
natural gas to  Italy  by 44 percent in the first quarter as
unrest in  Libya  affected supply from the North African country.  Gazprom,  Russia ’s gas-export monopoly, sold 4.78 billion
cubic meters of gas to Italy, compared with 3.3 billion cubic
meters in the same period of 2010, according to a first-quarter
report posted today on the company’s website.  Deliveries through the Greenstream pipeline to Italy from
Libya stopped on Feb. 22. The link normally supplies Italy with
about 10 percent of its gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
