First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) , a
Nigerian lender, won’t need to raise fresh capital to fund its
acquisition of  Finbank Plc (FIRSTINL) , said Chief Executive Officer Ladi Balogun.  “The acquisition won’t require us to raise any additional
or external capital,” he said in an interview in Lagos on May
13. “We have enough capital.”  First City Monument Bank signed a memorandum of
understanding to merge with and recapitalize Finbank, a Nigerian
lender bailed out by the nation’s central bank in 2009 amid a
debt crisis that threatened the banking industry with collapse,
it said on May 5.  Shareholders of FCMB, as the lender is known, voted in
favor of it adopting an international-banking license at its
annual general meeting under new regulations stipulated by the
central bank, it said today in an e-mailed statement.  FCMB’s shares declined 19 kobo, or 2.4 percent, to 7.71
naira by the 2:30 p.m. close of trading in Lagos. Finbank
dropped 3 kobo, or 4 percent, to 73 kobo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
