International Monetary Fund chief
Dominique Strauss-Kahn appeared in court for the first time
since he was pulled off a plane May 14 in  New York  and accused
of trying to rape a hotel maid.  Strauss-Kahn, who was taken into custody aboard an Air
France flight at  John F. Kennedy International Airport  as it
prepared to depart, was escorted into Manhattan criminal court
this morning. Prosecutors asked the judge that the IMF chief be
held in custody until trial. He faces as many as 25 years in
prison if convicted of the most serious count, prosecutors said.  The IMF chief is also charged with unlawful imprisonment
and a criminal sex act. A potential candidate for the French
presidency, Strauss-Kahn, 62, has denied the charges and will
plead not guilty, his lawyer Benjamin Brafman has said.  The alleged attack on a 32-year-old woman at a Sofitel
hotel in midtown  Manhattan  occurred May 14, according to the New
York Police Department. Strauss-Kahn was picked out of a lineup
by the maid, police said.  The arraignment had been scheduled for yesterday and was
delayed after investigators sought a warrant for a physical
examination. Strauss-Kahn gave police permission to examine him
for physical evidence of scratches and DNA from his accuser,
according to Brafman.  Defense lawyers will make their bail arguments after the
prosecution.  To contact the reporters on this story:
