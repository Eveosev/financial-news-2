Economists covering the Brazilian
economy trimmed their forecast for 2011 inflation for a second
straight week, after consumer prices rose less than expected in
April and state-owned oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  cut
gasoline prices.  Consumer prices will rise 6.31 percent in 2011, compared
with a week-earlier forecast of 6.33 percent, according to a May
13  survey  of about 100 economists published today. The outlook
for inflation in 2012 was unchanged from the previous week’s
forecast of 5 percent, the survey showed.  Monthly inflation unexpectedly slowed to 0.77 percent in
April, the lowest level since December. Economists had expected
prices to rise 0.84 percent, according the median of 39
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  Brazil  is relying on a mix of
higher borrowing costs, measures to slow credit growth and
spending cuts to cool inflation. Central bank President
Alexandre Tombini raised the benchmark Selic by 25 basis points
to 12 percent on April 20 after 50 basis-point increases in
January and March.  Economists are still not convinced that the government will
get inflation under control, and do not have a clear picture of
how well the central bank’s restrictions on credit growth will
work, said  Andre Perfeito , chief economist at Sao Paulo-based
Gradual Investimentos.  ‘Flying Blind’  “We are not sure if this slower pace of inflation can be
confirmed yet,” Perfeito said, speaking by telephone from Sao
Paulo. “We’re not sure whether the macro measures will be
effective. We are flying blind right now.”  The central bank’s benchmark Selic rate will be 12.5
percent at the end of the year, and 12.25 percent at the end of
2012, the survey found. Both forecasts were unchanged from the
previous week.  The economists surveyed by the central bank expect gross
domestic product to expand 4 percent this year, unchanged from
the previous week’s forecast. Analysts cut their forecast for
2012 growth to 4.20 percent, from 4.21 percent.  Analysts expect the real to end 2011 at 1.62 per  U.S.
dollar , unchanged from the previous week’s survey.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.52 percent at 8:50 a.m.
New York time. The real strengthened 0.1 percent to 1.6354 per
U.S. dollar.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA said last week that its fuel
distribution unit will cut gasoline prices by 6 percent due to
cheaper ethanol, which accounts for 25 percent of blended
gasoline in Brazil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
