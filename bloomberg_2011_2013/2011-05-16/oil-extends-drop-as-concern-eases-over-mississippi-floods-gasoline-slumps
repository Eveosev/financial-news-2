Oil dropped for a second day in  New
York  on concern  Greece ’s debt crisis will curb European growth
and as analysts predicted U.S. fuel inventories will rise,
signaling lower demand.  Futures fell as much as 0.6 percent after declining to the
lowest in more than a week yesterday.  Europe  will consider
extending Greece’s debt-repayment schedule as part of a package
including deeper spending cuts, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said in Brussels. An Energy Department report
tomorrow may show U.S. crude stockpiles rose for a fourth week.  “The concerns in Europe are going to create a lack of
confidence again,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of
Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted oil will
average $100 this year. “People will pull the horns in from
spending. That feeds back into the demand prospects for crude.
We’ve also still got a fair few barrels in the U.S.”  Crude for June delivery slipped as much as 61 cents to
$96.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $97.19 at 12:48 p.m. Singapore time. Oil
fell $2.28, or 2.3 percent, yesterday to $97.37, the lowest
since May 6. Prices are 39 percent higher in the past year.  Brent Premium  Brent oil for July settlement slid 22 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $110.62 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The June contract expired yesterday. It lost
$1.10, or 1 percent, to $112.73.  European finance ministers for the first time suggested
talks with bondholders on “reprofiling” Greece’s debt
repayments, saying last year’s 110-billion euro ($156 billion)
rescue has failed to restore the country to financial health,
according to Juncker. His comments suggest ministers’ views are
closer to the 85 percent of international investors who, in a
Bloomberg poll last week, said Greece is likely to default.  An Energy Department report tomorrow may show U.S. crude
inventories climbed 1.5 million barrels from 370.3 million
barrels, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline supplies may increase 1 million
barrels, the survey shows. U.S. petroleum demand is “abysmally
low,” according to  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisors in Houston.  Gasoline Tumbles  Gasoline plunged to a two-month low after Louisiana opened
11 of the 125 gates at the Morganza floodway. The action allowed
the  Mississippi  to pour into the Atchafalaya River basin in an
attempt to save  Baton Rouge  and  New Orleans  from inundation,
easing concern refineries and fuel supplies will be disrupted.  Gasoline for June delivery was at $2.9248 today after
tumbling 14.33 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $2.9311 a gallon in New
York yesterday, the lowest settlement since March 16.  Louisiana refineries are the second-biggest fuel producers
in the U.S., after  Texas , according to the Energy Department.
The Atchafalaya River basin has 2,264 oil or natural gas wells
producing 19,278 barrels of crude daily, about 10 percent of
 Louisiana ’s onshore total, and 252.6 million cubic feet of gas,
according to the state.  Alon USA Energy Inc. said levees should protect its
refinery near Krotz Springs, Louisiana, from the Mississippi and
the opened spillways. The 83,000-barrel-a-day plant is within an
evacuation zone. Parish officials gave the refinery permission
to remain open.  Oil Options  The most actively traded oil option was the June $95 put,
which gives investors the right to buy New York oil for June
delivery at $95 a barrel. The price of the contract was
unchanged at 26 cents. The second-most active option, the June
$100 call, which gives investors the right to buy oil for the
same month at $100, fell 88 percent to 15 cents. Both contracts
expire today.  Oil prices  closed yesterday below the 100-day moving
average of $98.41 a barrel, a move that typically indicates
prices may fall further, according to traders that use technical
charts to track prices.  Crude is also finding support along the lower band on the
Bollinger chart, according to  Stephen Schork , President of
Villanova-Pennsylvania-based analysts The Schork Group Inc. in a
report today. That level is currently at $96.06, according to
Bloomberg data using the 30-day moving average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
