India ,  Asia ’s third-largest energy
consumer, may be able to produce electricity from the sun as
cheaply as from coal and other fossil fuel-based  power plants  by
2017, according to KPMG LLP.  India may install three times as much solar capacity as the
government intends by 2022 if sun-powered electricity is able to
match the cost of conventional power, a point referred to as
grid parity, said KPMG’s Executive Director Santosh Kamath, lead
author of a solar report to be released this week.  “We are heading for grid parity and it’s just a question
of when,” Kamath, who heads the advisory firm’s India renewable
energy practice, said in a phone interview. “In that scenario,
the adoption of solar becomes entirely market-driven.”  India, which produces  71 percent  of its electricity from
coal, seeks to add 120,000 megawatts of power by 2017 to reduce
blackouts threatening development in the world’s second-fastest
growing major economy. Indian companies have announced about $7
billion of overseas energy acquisitions since January 2010 as
they seek coal, uranium and other fuels, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Twice as Costly  Today, solar power costs more than twice as much as the
5.42 rupees per kilowatt-hour that it costs to deliver
electricity to consumers, said KPMG which is advising
Maharashtra State Power Generation Co. on a 125-megawatt solar
power project.  The cost of fossil-fuel electricity may rise as much as 5.5
percent annually as India has to buy more expensive imported
coal and replace aging plants, Kamath said. The country’s coal
deficit may triple over the next five to seven years, a unit of
Moody’s Investors Service said in a February report.  Solar power prices are projected to decline by 7 percent a
year in the next decade on more efficient technologies and lower
manufacturing costs, the report said.  If solar power becomes competitive with other sources,
India could add 39,070 megawatts of grid-connected solar
projects from 2017 and 2022, including residential rooftop
panels and 18,455 megawatts of solar-powered telecommunication
towers and agricultural water pumps, according to the report.  The government has set a target of installing 22,000
megawatts of solar power capacity by 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
