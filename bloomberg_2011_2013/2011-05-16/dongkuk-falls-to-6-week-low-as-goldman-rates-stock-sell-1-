Dongkuk Steel Mill Co. fell to the
lowest level in more than six weeks in Seoul trading after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its stock rating to “sell,”
saying the company’s earnings growth may slow.  South Korea ’s third-largest steelmaker lost 6.8 percent to
39,600 won as of 12:10 p.m. on the Korea Exchange, heading for
the lowest close since March 31 and becoming the worst performer
on the  MSCI AC Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index.  Goldman Sachs reduced its recommendation on Dongkuk from
“neutral,” forecasting a 9.5 percent decline in earnings-per-
share in 2012. Dongkuk expects a “positive” impact on earnings
from investments made in recent years, Kim Sun Hong, a company
spokesman, said by phone today. He declined to comment on the
Goldman Sachs’ rating.  “Dongkuk will be unable to sustain its recent higher plate
prices and orders as Japanese supply comes back online,”
Goldman Sachs analysts led by Rajeev Das wrote in a report
today. The analysts also cited a “very weak” domestic
construction market.  Dongkuk Steel has advanced 13 percent this year compared
with a 2.7 percent gain in the  Kospi Index. (KOSPI)   Posco (005490) , South Korea’s
largest steelmaker, fell 5.9 percent in the same period, while
 Hyundai Steel Co. (004020) , the second-largest, added 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
