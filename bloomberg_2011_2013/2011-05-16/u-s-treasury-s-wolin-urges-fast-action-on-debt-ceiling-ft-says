U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said Congress must act quickly to raise the U.S.’s debt
limit or risk a backlash from investors that would further
damage its fiscal position, the Financial Times said, citing an
interview.  Suggestions that there’s no urgency to raise the debt limit
and that the Treasury could push back the day of default by
making interest payments its top priority were dismissed by
Wolin, the FT said. “The point is that the world will
inevitably view this as a default -- something that has never
happened before,” Wolin said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
