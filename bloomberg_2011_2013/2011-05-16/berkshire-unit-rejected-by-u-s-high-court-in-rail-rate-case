The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
ruling that forced a railroad now owned by Warren Buffett’s
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  to refund $120 million in a dispute over
the rates for Wyoming coal shipments.  The justices today turned away BNSF Railway Co.’s appeal,
which stemmed from proceedings before the Surface Transportation
Board, the federal body that regulates railroad rates. The board
ordered refunds to two customers, Western Fuels Association Inc.
and Basin Electric Power Cooperative Inc.  The two cooperatives joined the Obama administration in
urging the high court not to consider the case.  Berkshire Hathaway last year acquired BNSF’s parent
company, Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLP. The company paid the
$120 million in 2009, according to regulatory filings.  The case is BNSF Railway Co. v. Surface Transportation
Board, 10-742.  To contact the reporter on this story:
