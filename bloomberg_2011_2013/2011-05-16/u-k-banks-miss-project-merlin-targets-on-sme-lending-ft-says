(Corrects source in headline.)  Bank of England data to be released
over the next week will show that in the first quarter the
U.K.â€™s five biggest banks missed targets for lending to small
and medium-size enterprises established under the Project Merlin
agreement signed with the U.K. Treasury by 11 percent, Sky News
 reported .  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,
committed to lending 76 billion pounds ($123 billion) in 2011,
or 19 billion pounds a quarter, to small businesses, Sky said.
The BOE figures however, show they lent only about 16.8 billion
pounds between January and March, Sky said, citing figures
collated by PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP for the Bank of England.
The banks all declined to comment, Sky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
