Alliance Boots Holdings Ltd., owner
of the largest U.K. drugstore chain, said annual profit rose 14
percent as it acquired businesses and began selling products
such as the Boots Laboratories Serum 7 skincare range overseas.  So-called trading profit increased to 1.05 billion pounds
($1.7 billion) in the year ended March 31, from 920 million
pounds a year earlier, the Nottingham, England-based company
said today in a statement. Net income declined to 595 million
pounds from 608 million pounds a year earlier after the company
had a tax gain in the previous fiscal year.  Alliance Boots, owned jointly by Chairman Stefano Pessina
and KKR & Co. after an 11.1 billion-pound buyout in 2007, said
it plans to focus on international expansion this year after
buying a majority stake in Turkish drug wholesaler Hedef
Alliance Holding A.S. and  Germany ’s Andreae-Noris Zahn AG in
fiscal 2010. The retailer is selling Boots health and beauty
products through partnerships with  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  in  Italy 
and other distributors across  Europe .  “Looking to the year ahead, we are planning for consumer
demand to be subdued and expect governments to continue to seek
ways to contain growth in healthcare expenditure,” Pessina said
in the statement.  Alliance Boots, which owns more than 3,250 stores globally,
parted company with Chief Executive Officer Andy Hornby in March
after he had spent less than two years in the position.  Revenue at the health and beauty division rose 1.7 percent,
while sales from pharmaceutical wholesaling gained 24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
