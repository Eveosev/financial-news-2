Portugal ’s port of Sines said a
liquefied natural gas tanker sailing from Bonny, Nigeria, is due
to arrive on May 23.  The volume of cargo being carried by the Gemmata was not
specified on the website of  Administracao do Porto de Sines SA ,
the port’s management company.  The Sines LNG terminal, with a capacity of 5.26 billion
cubic meters of natural gas a year, is managed by REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA, the nation’s power and gas grid
operator. LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for shipment by
tanker and then converted back to a gas at terminals for
distribution to users.  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s biggest oil and gas
company, receives LNG at Sines as well as gas from  Algeria 
through a pipeline crossing Morocco and Spain. Galp also
operates Portugal’s largest refinery at Sines. EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA, the country’s biggest power utility, runs a coal-
fired electricity plant at the site.  Other ships expected at Sines include Lia, a tanker
carrying crude that’s sailing from Malabo in  Equatorial Guinea 
and is scheduled to arrive on May 26. Cape Agamemnon, a ship
carrying coal from Puerto Bolivar in Colombia, is due to arrive
in Sines on May 18.  Sines is one of the European Union’s biggest deepwater
harbors, according to the port’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
