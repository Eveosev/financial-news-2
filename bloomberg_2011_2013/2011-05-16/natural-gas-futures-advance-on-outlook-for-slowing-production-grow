Natural gas futures gained for a
third day in New York on speculation that production growth will
slip amid reduced gas rigs and flooding in  Louisiana  that may
disrupt output.  Gas rose 1.7 percent after Baker Hughes Inc. reported May
13 that U.S. natural-gas rigs dropped to the lowest level in 15
months. The area of Louisiana that may be affected by
Mississippi River flooding includes wells that produce 252.6
million cubic feet of gas, according to the state.  “Falling rigs are an indicator that you’ll see production
taper off in the long run,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker with Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut. “It’s
definitely supportive of prices.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 7.2 cents to settle at
$4.318 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 2 percent this
year.  The number of U.S. gas rigs tumbled by 16 to 874 last week,
the lowest level since Jan. 29, 2010, Baker Hughes data showed.  Nine gates have been opened in Louisiana’s Morganza
floodway, sending excess water from the  Mississippi  down the
Atchafalaya River. The National Weather Service is predicting
near-record flooding for towns along the Atchafalaya and
surrounding wetlands.  “Worries about how much production will be cut off from
Louisiana are also putting a bid in the market,” McGillian
said.  Gas Production  The Energy Department lowered its forecast for gas output
in 2011 and raised its outlook for prices in a report on May 10.  Gas production will average 63.23 billion cubic feet a day
in 2011, down from 63.32 billion estimated in April, the
department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana,
will average $4.37 per thousand cubic feet, or $4.24 per million
British thermal units, up from the previous estimate of $4.10
per million Btu, according to the department.  “Rig counts seemed to keep growing because of the dynamics
of shale gas,” said  Peter Beutel , the president of Cameron
Hanover Inc., an energy advisory company in  New Canaan ,
Connecticut. “If the economics have finally aligned themselves
in a tighter balance, it would have to be a positive factor for
natural gas exploration and development.”  Warmer-than-normal weather is likely in parts of the
southern U.S. and Midwest from May 21 through May 25, according
to MDA EarthSat Weather in Rockville, Maryland. Above-normal
temperatures may boost air conditioning use, increasing the
demand for gas as a power-plant fuel.  Houston Heat  The high in Houston on May 22 may be 91 degrees Fahrenheit
(33 Celsius), 4 degrees above normal, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. The high in Memphis,
Tennessee, may be 84 degrees, 2 above normal.  Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 44 percent above normal
from May 22 through May 26,  David Salmon , a meteorologist with
Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri, said in a note to
clients today.  Power plants  use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
203,689 as of 2:38 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 308,000. Volume was 209,912 on May 13. Open interest was
960,607 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
945,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
