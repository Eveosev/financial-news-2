Israel ’s economy expanded an
annualized 4.7 percent in the first quarter as exports and
investments climbed.  Growth slowed from a revised 7.6 percent in the fourth
quarter, the fastest in four years, the Jerusalem-based Central
 Bureau of Statistics  said in an e-mailed statement today. The
median forecast of 8 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 5.1
percent.  “The fourth quarter figure was exceptional. This is still
very high growth,” Victor Bahar, deputy manager of Bank
Hapoalim Ltd.’s economics department, said by telephone before
the announcement. “Exports are growing quickly and so is
investment, especially housing. We are at full employment.
Everything looks very good.”  Israel’s economy is likely to expand 4.5 percent this year
and 4 percent in 2012, the  Bank of Israel  forecast in March.
Unemployment is likely to drop to 6.1 percent from 6.7 percent
in 2010, it said. Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  has
been gradually raising the benchmark rate from a record low of
0.5 percent in August 2009 to 3 percent as the economy, led by
exports, recovers from the global recession faster than many
other advanced countries.  The next rate decision on May 23 will require finding a
compromise between the strong growth figures and the increasing
gap between rates in Israel and those in other advanced
countries, which helps strengthen the shekel, Bahar said.  The shekel has gained about 7 percent in the past 12 months
against the dollar and traded at 3.5360 shekels at 12:54 p.m. in
 Tel Aviv . The benchmark TA-25 stock index has advanced about 14
percent, led by Avner Oil Exploration-L.P.  Consumer prices rose by less than expected in April,
advancing 0.6 percent for the month. Annual inflation slowed to
4 percent from 4.3 percent in March, the fourth month it has
exceeded the government’s 1 percent to 3 percent target range,
the statistics bureau said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
