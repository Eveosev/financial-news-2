The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
revive a challenge to the religious references that have become
standard fare during presidential inauguration ceremonies.  The justices today turned away an appeal by Michael Newdow,
an atheist minister and lawyer who once argued before the high
court against the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in
public schools.  In the latest case, Newdow sued participants in President
Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, including Chief Justice  John Roberts , who administered the oath of office. The oath contained
both the words required by the Constitution and the phrase “so
help me God,” which incoming presidents have included at every
inauguration since 1932.  Newdow also objected to prayers offered at the 2009
ceremony by two private clergy members, Rick Warren and Joseph Lowery. More than 250 people and 19 organizations joined Newdow
in filing the church-state suit.  A federal appeals court said the group lacked the legal
right, or standing, to press the case.  The justices earlier this year rejected Newdow’s challenge
to “In God We Trust,” the motto that adorns U.S. currency and
offends some non-believers.  The case is Newdow v. Roberts, 10-757.  To contact the reporter on this story:
