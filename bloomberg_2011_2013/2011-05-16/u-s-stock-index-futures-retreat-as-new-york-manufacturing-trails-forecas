U.S. stock futures retreated,
signaling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may extend a two-week
slump, as slower-than-forecast growth in New York-area
manufacturing fueled concern the economic rebound is slowing.  Futures on the  S&P 500  expiring next month lost 0.3 percent
to 1,329.8 at 8:34 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones Indusrial Average
futures fell 36 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,520.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index fell to 11.9 from a one-year high of 21.7 in April.
Economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected it would drop to
19.6, according to the median forecast. Readings greater than
zero signal gains in the so-called Empire State Index that
covers New York, northern  New Jersey  and southern Connecticut.  The S&P 500 has lost 1.9 percent so far this month, led by
energy and raw-material producers. The gauge has still climbed
6.4 percent this year as government stimulus measures and
better-than-estimated corporate earnings boosted confidence in
the economic recovery.  Earlier declines in U.S. futures came as  Greece  prepared to
ask for a bigger bailout amid renewed sovereign-debt concern in
 Europe . Greece will plead for European governments and the
 International Monetary Fund  to boost its 110 billion-euro ($155
billion) bailout today in talks clouded by the arrest of IMF
Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn. European finance
ministers will also discuss the approval of 78 billion euros in
Portuguese aid at their Brussels meeting.  Strauss-Kahn, 62, is awaiting his first court appearance on
attempted rape charges after an alleged attack on a 32-year-old
female maid at a Sofitel hotel in midtown Manhattan on May 14,
according to the New York Police Department. He has denied the
charges and will plead not guilty, his lawyer Benjamin Brafman
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
