Third Point LLC, the hedge fund run
by  Daniel Loeb , increased its stakes in energy companies by 18
percent in the first quarter, according to Bloomberg data based
on a regulatory filing.  The New York-based fund purchased 11 million shares of
Houston-based  El Paso Corp. (EP) , valued at $198 million, according
to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. El Paso, which provides natural gas and related
energy products, is the firm’s biggest U.S.-listed holding.  Third Point also bought 2.5 million shares in San Antonio-
based  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) , valued at $67.1 million. Tesoro is the
largest independent refiner on the U.S. West Coast.  The fund reduced its holdings in materials companies by
about 14 percent, Bloomberg data show. It sold almost 763,000
shares of chemical maker LyondellBasell Industries NV, based in
Rotterdam.  Third Point is an event-driven fund, betting on companies
facing mergers, spinoffs and bankruptcies. Elissa Doyle, a
spokeswoman for Third Point, didn’t immediately respond to an e-
mail seeking comment.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter’s
end to list their U.S.-traded stocks, options and convertible
bonds. The filings don’t show non-U.S. securities or how much
cash the firms hold.  Hedge funds  are lightly regulated pools of capital whose
managers can invest in any asset, and share in annual profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
