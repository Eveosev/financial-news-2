The governments of  Rwanda , Tanzania
and Burundi refused a request to delay construction of a 90
megawatt hydropower plant after advisers said more people would
be affected than originally estimated, according to the Nile
Basin Initiative.  The governments expect an environmental impact study to be
completed on schedule by Oct. 27, said Mwkikali Wambua,
development specialist at the intergovernmental organization,
said in an interview today in Kigali, Rwandaâ€™s capital.  Consultants requested a delay after finding an estimated
15,000 households will be affected by the project, up from the
original forecast of 600, Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.
told a conference in Kigali.  The $340 million plant, which will supply Rwanda, Tanzania
and Burundi with electricity, should be operating by 2016,
Wambua said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
