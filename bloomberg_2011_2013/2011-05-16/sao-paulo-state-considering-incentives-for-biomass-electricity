Brazil’s state of  Sao Paulo  may
provide incentives to sugar-cane mills that burn their waste
residues to produce electricity as the region seeks to double
its biomass power capacity within three years.  The state’s treasury is considering tax breaks for
equipment to upgrade mills’ cogeneration plants, Diogo de
Castro, a spokesman for Sao Paulo’s Secretariat of Energy, said
today in a phone interview. He didn’t know when a decision may
be reached.  Sao Paulo currently produces has 2,600 megawatts of biomass
power capacity, and wants to reach 5,000 megawatts by 2014, he
said. “The aim is to cut the price of electricity,” generated
from biomass.  Other incentives may include deferments of some state taxes
and partnerships with utilities to build the substations and
transmission lines necessary to connect new power plants to the
grid, according to an article yesterday in Sao Paulo-based Folha
de Sao Paulo.  The state produces 60 percent of  Brazil ’s sugar cane,
according to the Sao Paulo-based industry association  Uniao da
Industria de Cana-de-Acucar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
