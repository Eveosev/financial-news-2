Fonciere des Regions (FDR)  SA, the French
office landlord with stakes in five other real estate investment
trusts, plans to raise as much as 550 million euros ($775
million) in a bond sale to refinance loans.  FDR aims to raise 480 million euros initially by selling
convertible bonds maturing Jan. 1, 2017, with an option to sell
an additional 70 million euros of securities, the Metz-based
company said in a statement today. It will be the FDR’s first
bond sale.  The rate at which the bonds may be converted into stock
will be 20 percent to 25 percent higher than the weighted
average price on May 19. Depending on investor demand, the
coupon for the bond will range from 15 basis points less than
the calculated yield for five and six-year interest rate swaps
to 35 basis points above that measure, FDR said. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  The proceeds will allow FDR to “diversify its sources of
financing and to lengthen its debt maturity,” the company said.  FDR shares declined 42 cents to 71.33 euros at 9:11 a.m. in
Paris trading, valuing the company at 3.92 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
