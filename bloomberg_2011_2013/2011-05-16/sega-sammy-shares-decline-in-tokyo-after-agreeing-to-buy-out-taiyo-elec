Sega Sammy Holdings Inc. (6460) , a Japanese
video-game maker, dropped the most in seven weeks in Tokyo
trading after the company agreed to buy out Taiyo Elec Co. for
6.5 billion yen ($80 million) in stock.  The company fell as much as 5 percent to 1,387 yen, the
biggest intraday drop since March 23, and was down 2.5 percent
at the 11 a.m. trading break. Taiyo Elec shares were bid at 505
yen, 19 percent more than the closing price on May 13.  Sega Sammy will offer 0.4 of its own shares for each of the
11.1 million Taiyo Elec shares it’s buying, the company said in
a May 13 statement. That’s 37 percent higher than Taiyo’s
closing price on Friday. The Tokyo-based company’s Sammy Corp.
unit already controlled 51 percent of the Japanese pinball
machine maker, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The transaction will be completed on Aug. 1, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
