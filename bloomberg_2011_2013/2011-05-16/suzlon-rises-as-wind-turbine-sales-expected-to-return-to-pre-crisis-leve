Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  India â€™s largest
wind-turbine maker, rose the most in two weeks to as much as 4.6
percent after saying that sales this year may rise to record
levels reached before the global financial crisis.  The shares gained as much as 4.6 percent to 55.25 rupees
and were trading at 54.65 rupees at 10:02 a.m. local time,
compared with a 0.5 percent fall in the benchmark Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange.  Ahmedabad-based Suzlon expects sales to surge as much as 45
percent to 260 billion rupees ($5.8 billion) in the year ending
March 31, 2012, Chief Financial Officer  Robin Banerjee  said by
phone on May 14 after the company posted its first quarterly
profit since December 2009.  That would be the highest for Suzlon since fiscal 2009,
when sales revenue reached a record 260.8 billion rupees,
according to Bloomberg data. Orders tumbled and financing for
wind farms dried up during the credit crisis when clean energy
investment fell 6.5 percent to $145 billion in 2009, according
to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
