Google Inc. (GOOG) , the worldâ€™s biggest
Internet-search company, said it fueled $64 billion worth of
economic activity in the U.S. last year, an 18 percent increase
from a year ago.  The company calculates the economic activity by estimating
that for every $1 a customer spends on Google AdWords, that
business receives an average of $8 in profit, Claire Hughes Johnson, vice president of global online sales, said in a  blog
posting . In California, for example, Google provided $15.2
billion in economic activity for 288,000 businesses and
organizations.  Google, which reported $29.3 billion in revenue last year,
is benefitting from rising demand for online advertising, even
as it faces mounting competition from Facebook Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. The total U.S. online ad market is expected to
grow 10.5 percent to $28.5 billion in 2011, according to
 EMarketer Inc.  in  New York .  Google, based in Mountain View, California, fell $11.13, or
2.1 percent, to $518.42 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have declined 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
