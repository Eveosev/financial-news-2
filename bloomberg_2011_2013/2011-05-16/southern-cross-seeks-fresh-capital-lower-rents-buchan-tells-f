Southern Cross Healthcare Plc Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Buchan said the company must attract
fresh capital at the same time as it secures lower rental
agreements from its landlords, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview. “The two have got to be developed at the
same time,” Buchan said, according to the FT. “Ultimately we
need to bring fresh capital into the business,” he said, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
