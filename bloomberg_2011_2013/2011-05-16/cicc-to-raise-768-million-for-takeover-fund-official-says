China  International Capital Corp.
aims to complete the first round of fund-raising this month for
5 billion yuan ($768 million) to invest in domestic takeovers,
said a company executive with direct knowledge.  Investors include pension funds and insurers, said the
official, who declined to be identified as the matter is
confidential. Yang Guang, a Beijing-based spokesman for CICC,
declined to comment.  CICC, China’s top-ranked investment bank in 2010, is
raising funds as the nation’s regulator amends takeover rules to
allow buyers to raise cash through private placements.  Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery Joint-Stock Co. in March said it
planned to invest 300 million yuan in CICC’s “industry
consolidation” fund, according to a  statement  to Shenzhen Stock
Exchange from the Chinese liquor maker. The fund would be
managed by the bank’s CICC Jiacheng Investment Management Co.
investment unit, Jiangsu Yanghe said.  The Beijing-based firm received approval from the China
Securities Regulatory Commission in February to set up the fund,
according to the executive.  The investment bank last year was ranked first in advising
on takeovers involving Chinese companies and among managers of
domestic equity sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
