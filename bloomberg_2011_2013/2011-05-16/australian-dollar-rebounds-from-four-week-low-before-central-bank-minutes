The Australian dollar erased earlier
gains after the  Reserve Bank  said a rising currency is helping
contain inflation pressures.  Policy makers said higher rates are likely to be needed
“at some point," according to minutes released today in Sydney
of a May 3 meeting, when RBA officials kept borrowing costs
unchanged at 4.75 percent for a fifth-straight time. New
Zealand’s currency rose versus the yen, snapping a two-day drop,
after Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. said
favorable weather may help milk production reach a record in the
season ending this month.  "The Aussie dollar’s strength and recent appreciation has
weighed on policy deliberations," said  Sue Trinh , a senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong . ‘‘The
RBA said higher rates will be needed some time in the future but
clearly it’s not imminently. That’s also disappointing the
market.”  The so-called Aussie was at $1.0545 as of 12:17 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0556 yesterday in  New York , when it fell to
$1.0514, the weakest since April 19. It fetched 85.39 yen from
85.28 yen. New Zealand’s dollar rose to 63.12 yen from 62.99
yen. The currency traded at 77.95 U.S. cents from 77.96 cents.  The Australian dollar reached $1.1012 on May 2, the most
since the currency was freely floated in 1983.  “If economic conditions continued to evolve as expected,
higher  interest rates  were likely to be required at some point
if inflation was to remain consistent with the medium-term
target,” the central bank minutes showed.“Members viewed the
current mildly restrictive stance of monetary policy as
remaining appropriate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
