The  Vancouver Canucks  scored two
goals in a 79-second span during the third period to rally for a
3-2 victory over the  San Jose  Sharks in Game 1 of the National
Hockey League’s Western Conference finals.  Kevin Bieksa had the tying goal and Henrik Sedin scored the
game-winner as the top-seeded Canucks erased a 2-1 deficit last
night at Rogers Arena in Vancouver.  The Canucks, back in the conference finals for the first
time since 1994, will also host Game 2 in the best-of-seven
series on May 18.  San Jose is now 2-9 all-time in the Western Conference
finals, having been swept last year by the Chicago Blackhawks.  The Western Conference champion advances to the Stanley Cup
finals against Tampa Bay or  Boston . The Lightning hold a 1-0
lead in the Eastern Conference finals, with Game 2 scheduled for
tomorrow in Boston.  Sharks goaltender  Antti Niemi  stopped 24 of 25 shots over
the first two periods last night before the Canucks broke
through in the final 20 minutes. Joe Thornton and  Patrick Marleau  scored goals for second-seeded San Jose, while Maxim Lapierre tallied his first of the postseason for Vancouver.  Bieksa, a Canucks’ defenseman, beat Niemi 7:02 into the
third period to tie the score 2-2. San Jose’s Dany Heatley was
ejected for an elbowing penalty 32 seconds later and Sedin,
Vancouver’s captain, scored on the power play to give the
Canucks their first lead of the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
