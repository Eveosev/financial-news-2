Croatia ’s market regulator extended
the suspension of trading in  INA  Industrija Nafte d.d., saying
Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., which controls INA, has not sufficiently
explained its trading activities.  The suspension on the  Zagreb bourse  will last “no longer”
than through May 20, or may be lifted earlier, pending an answer
from the Hungarian refiner, the regulator, knows as  Hanfa , said
in a statement to the bourse.  This is the fourth time in the last two months Hanfa has
suspended trading in INA stock, citing suspicious trading
activities. Tensions between Budapest-based Mol and Croatian
authorities increased after the Hungarian company made an offer
to purchase the outstanding shares in INA in December. The
government claimed it had not been notified of Mol’s intention
before the offer. Mol has a 47.26 percent stake in INA and the
government in Zagreb holds 44.84 percent.  Mol said on May 10 it had complied with the watchdog’s
request and was “surprised” by the extended suspension.  The Hungarian refiner on April 28 said it bought INA shares
from private investors outside the offer period. The company
hasn’t reached any disclosure obligation level that would have
demanded a stock exchange announcement, it said.  In a May 6 letter, Mol told Hanfa that all of its foreign
“direct or indirect interests are being continuously
disclosed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
