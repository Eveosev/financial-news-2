Chinese consumers are increasingly
brand conscious as the country is set to become the world’s
largest luxury market, according to KPMG International.  Buyers in  China  rank French brands as the most favorable
labels, followed by those from  Italy  and Hong Kong, KPMG said
in a report today.  “China is continuing its march toward becoming the
largest luxury market in the world, buoyed by extremely
favorable attitudes towards brands, increasing levels of wealth
in tier-two as well as tier-one cities, and a continued
confidence in future economic prospects,” according to the
report.  China has a large number of young millionaires, which
translates into opportunities for brand owners to use
technology such as digital marketing and online sales,
according to the KPMG report, which was based on a survey of
1,200 consumers in 24 Chinese cities by TNS, a market research
company.  Customers from the Greater China region, which includes
 Hong Kong , Macau and  Taiwan , will account for 44 percent of
global luxury-goods sales by 2020, compared with 15 percent now,
CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets forecast in January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
