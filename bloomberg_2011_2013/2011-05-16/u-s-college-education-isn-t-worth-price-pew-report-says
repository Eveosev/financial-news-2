Higher education fails to provide
students “good value” for the money they and their families
spend, more than half of U.S. adults said in a survey.  The debate over higher education’s value “has been
triggered not just by rising costs but also by hard economic
times,” according to a report released yesterday by the
Washington-based  Pew Research Center . The organization, an
independent research group funded by Philadelphia-based  Pew
Charitable Trusts , surveyed 2,142 adults, aged 18 and older,
from March 15 through March 29.  The survey follows a call by President  Barack Obama  for the
U.S. to achieve the highest college graduation rate in the world
by 2020. The U.S. now ranks 12th among 36 developed nations,
according to a report last year by the  College Board .  In the poll, 75 percent of U.S. adults said college was
unaffordable for most Americans, and almost half said that
 student loans  had made it harder to pay other bills.  At the same time, 86 percent of college graduates said that
it had been a good investment for them personally. College
graduates said they earned an average $20,000 a year more
because of their degrees, a figure that closely matches  U.S.
Census Bureau  data, the survey found.  The report included a separate survey of 1,055 college
presidents that was designed by the Pew Research Center and the
 Chronicle of Higher Education . That survey, conducted March 15
through April 24, showed concern about diminishing higher
education standards and quality.  Some 58 percent of college presidents said public high
school students arrive at college less well prepared than their
counterparts a decade ago, according to the survey. Just 19
percent said the U.S. system of higher education is the best in
the world, and 7 percent said they believe it will be the best
10 years from now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
