A Rwandan court gave opposition
leader and former presidential candidate Victoire Ingabire an
additional 35 days to prepare her defense against charges of
terrorism and genocide denial.  Appearing in court today, Ingabire asked for a four-month
delay, saying she hadn’t had access to all her files and needed
more time to translate documents for her British lawyers.
Prosecutors denied that her access to papers had been
restricted.  Ingabire is accused of providing financial support to the
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of  Rwanda , or FDLR, a Hutu
rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and “causing
state insecurity and divisionism,” according to an e-mailed
statement from the prosecution. Ingabire denies the charges.  After the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, which left 800,000
ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead, the FDLR emerged in
eastern Congo, and has conducted several cross-border raids into
Rwanda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
