RM Plc (RM/) , a U.K. provider of
educational products, said it incurred a first-half net loss of
1.3 million pounds ($2.1 million), compared with a profit of
314,000 pounds a year earlier, on lower sales and reorganization
costs.  “We experienced challenging market conditions in our core
markets in the first half, as customers continued to respond to
changes in policy and funding in both the U.K. and the U.S.,”
Chief Executive Officer Terry Sweeney said today in a statement.
“We have realigned our cost base through a restructuring
program to reflect the changed conditions and to protect group
profitability.”  First-half revenue fell 15 percent to 133 million pounds,
the Abingdon, England-based company said in the statement. In
the U.K. market, spending was reduced because of education
policy changes, RM said. The company had a 1.8 million-pound
charge from a restructuring program.  -- Editors: Alan Purkiss, Peter Branton  To contact the reporter on this story:
