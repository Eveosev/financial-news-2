PGE SA, Poland’s largest utility,
used almost 29 percent of its 2011 carbon-dioxide quota in the
first three months.  PGE emitted 15.2 million metric tons of CO2, compared with
an average annual quota of 53.1 million allocated for free from
2008 to 2012 under the European Union’s emissions trading
system, the Warsaw-based company said today in an earnings
report. That compares with 15.5 million tons in the first
quarter of last year.  PGE’s Elektrownia Belchatow, the EU’s most polluting plant,
emitted 7.7 million tons in the first three months, or almost 29
percent of its average annual allocation, the data show. The
EU’s system is the world’s largest cap-and-trade program.  EU permits for December rose 0.1 percent to 16.74 euros
($23.65) a ton as of 9:24 a.m. on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The contract has gained 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
