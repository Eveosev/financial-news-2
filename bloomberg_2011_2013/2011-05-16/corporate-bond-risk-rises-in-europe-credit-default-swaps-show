The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped seven basis points to 324 at 3:30 p.m. in
London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 32.5
basis points to 781, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 9.75 basis points to 179.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 11.5 basis points to 240.5
and the subordinated index dropped 19 to 483.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
