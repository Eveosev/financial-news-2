Tam SA (TAMM4) , the controller of the
Brazilian airline that agreed to be bought by Chile’s  Lan
Airlines SA (LAN) , posted a first-quarter profit as an appreciation of
the real reduced the company’s debt denominated in dollars.  Tam’s net income attributable to controlling shareholders
reached 148.1 million reais between January and March, compared
with a loss of 69.1 million in the same period in 2010,
according to a regulatory filing.  Net revenue increased 17 percent to 3.04 billion reais. The
company had a 151.2 million-real gain with the currency exchange
rate, compared with 84.4 million reais spent in the first
quarter of 2010, as a stronger Brazilian real helped to reduce
the value of the contracts of leasing of aircrafts in local-
currency.  In August last year,  Chile ’s Lan Airlines announced the
acquisition of Tam, in a share transaction worth US$ 3.9
billion. Chile’s antitrust tribunal, known as TDLC, said in
January it’s reviewing the transaction after a request from a
consumer group.  “The completion of the merger, initially foreseen to
happen around the middle of this year, will probably occur only
in 2012,” Banco Fator SA’s analysts, including Jacqueline Lison, wrote in a May 9 report. “Of course that failure to
complete this agreement is a significant risk.”  Tam declined 1.1 percent to 34.34 reais at 11:57 a.m. New
York time in Sao Paulo trading. Through May 13, the shares have
declined 11 percent this year, compared with an 8.8 percent
decline of the Bovespa benchmark stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
