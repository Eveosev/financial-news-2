Middle East oils for sale to  Asia 
climbed to near their highest in three years as refining margins
remained higher than last year, spurring demand for crude.  Murban for July loading, produced in  Abu Dhabi , climbed 8
cents to a premium of 81 cents a barrel to its official selling
price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. June cargoes
reached a premium of 86 cents last month, the most in three
years. Lower Zakum, also produced in the emirate, advanced to
the same level. Qatar Marine gained 10 cents to a premium of 38
cents a barrel.  Middle East crudes have been supported by a surge in
refining profits for middle distillates including gasoil and
kerosene. The profit from processing Qatar Marine in a plant
capable of upgrading  fuel oil  into gasoline and diesel was at
$2.30 a barrel today, according to netback calculations by
Bloomberg and EnSys Energy. Thatâ€™s up from the six-month average
of $1.71. It reached $5.50 on May 6.  Oman oil for immediate loading fell 76 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $107.13 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai
for loading in July decreased 0.7 percent to $106.53 and Murban
crude climbed 0.6 percent to $112.03 a barrel.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for June narrowed 14
cents to $6.33 a barrel, PVM data showed. The exchange for swaps
for July fell 11 cents to $6.17 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery fell $1.45 to $107.35 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:32 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,001 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$107.25 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
