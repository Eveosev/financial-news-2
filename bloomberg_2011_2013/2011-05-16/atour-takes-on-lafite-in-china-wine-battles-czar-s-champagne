Can Chateau Latour catch Chateau
Lafite? We’ll find out on May 27, when vintages from Latour’s
cellar in Bordeaux spanning almost 150 years go on sale at
Christie’s International in  Hong Kong .  Wines resting in the perfect storage conditions of a
chateau’s cellar command a serious premium. That was part of the
story behind the mindboggling prices at Sotheby’s Hong Kong
Lafite sale last autumn -- a case of 1982 sold for $132,594, or
$11,050 a bottle, double the average current price.  The key factor, though, was the continuing Chinese love
affair with Lafite. At  Zachys  Hong Kong auction last month,
Lafite accounted for only 19 percent of the lots, but brought in
more than 40 percent of the dollars.  So this month’s 392-lot all-Latour sale looks like a bid to
woo more Asian attention, and get higher prices, for this
famously long-lived first growth. No one at Latour, of course,
is admitting they want to nudge out Lafite.  “We’re going to  China  because we need to build knowledge
and pass on messages,”  Latour  president Frederic Engerer said
last month as we tasted 2010 barrel samples in the chateau’s
light-filled tasting room. “Many people don’t know what to look
for in older vintages.”  It’s nice that they want to educate the Chinese, but the
real reason to show your face is to pull in bidders and hot-up a
brand.  1961 Vintage  This year is the 50th anniversary of the great 1961
vintage. The Latour sale, which spans vintages 1863 to 2009,
includes seven cases of the legendary 1961 in regular bottles
and magnums that Christie’s estimates will fetch HK$650,000 to
HK$850,000 ($84,020 to $109,873) each. From the same vintage,
there’s an imperial (estimated at HK$600,000 to HK$800,000), a
double-magnum (HK$220,000 to HK $300,000), and a jeroboam
(HK$400,000 to HK$600,000).  There are also rarities like 1899, 1928, 1929, 1945, and
1959. The catalogue features not just bottles, but also
attractive photos of the horses now used to plow the vineyard, a
nod to biodynamics experiments.  As an added provenance guarantee, wooden cases are branded
with the auction date. Each bottle carries a special back label
and uses a capsule seal from the  Prooftag  authentication and
traceability system that verify the wine was released directly
from the chateau.  Excessive? Provenance is becoming ever more important.
Empty Lafite bottles trade briskly in China for $450 and up,
increasing concern about fakes.  Everyone in the auction business has a prediction about
which first growth is going to be the next big Bordeaux in
China. Latour may not be Lafite’s nemesis.  Mouton Rothschild  Ben Nelson , president of  Chicago ’s Hart Davis Hart, and
Jamie Ritchie, president of Sotheby’s wine department, are both
big on Mouton Rothschild. The price of the 1982 has nearly
doubled in the past year, and other vintages are rising.  In some sales, Lafite is trending down. Ritchie sees prices
for younger Bordeaux flattening out and Latour increasing only
gradually. Burgundy is hot, he says, and there’s interest in
older vintages and labels like  Pontet-Canet .  Maybe that’s because the Asian auction market is awash in
the very top Bordeaux.  “In 2011, it’s not just China. The whole of  Asia  --  Japan ,
 Taiwan ,  Indonesia ,  Singapore  and  Thailand  -- is driving sales,”
said Ritchie.  Sotheby’s (BID)  has already sold $32 million of wine in
Hong Kong this year, nearly 70 percent of its worldwide sales.  While the majority of mega wines still go to Hong Kong,
U.S. auctions have seen higher prices since January, typically
with 95 percent to 100 percent of lots sold.  “U.S. buyers have more cash now, they’re more confident
and new Asian buyers are bidding here,” said Nelson, “This is
going to be the best first half of the year  Hart Davis Hart  has
ever had, by a long stretch. Everybody is looking for wine.”  Under the Sea  “The price insanity for some labels can’t last,” said
Nelson, who is concerned about inflation in China. Still, the
dozen auctions before the end of June offer new wines, new
venues and new technology to keep everyone interested.  I reached John Kapon, chief executive officer of  New York- 
based  Acker Merrall & Condit , as he was gearing up for May sales
in New York, Hong Kong and, for the first time,  Finland . On June
3, he’ll auction off two bottles of 19th-century champagne that
had been aging for two centuries at the bottom of the Baltic sea
in Finland’s Aland archipelago.  Last summer divers salvaged 145 bottles of champagne,
including 46 of  Veuve Clicquot , from a shipwrecked vessel. It’s
believed that the ship and wine were headed to the Russian
czar’s court at St Petersburg.  Talk about provenance! At an underwater laboratory in
 Spain , scientists are using aquatic cameras, sensors, and taste
tests to determine whether undersea aging is good for wine.  Naturally, the sale, to be held in Mariehamn, Aland, will
feature 25 to 35 other lots of “interesting” champagnes to get
momentum going. There’s nothing like bubbly to make auctioneers
giddy.  As Kapon put it, “2011 is on track to be another record
breaking year.”  ( Elin McCoy  writes on wine and spirits for Muse, the arts
