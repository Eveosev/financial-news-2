Actividades de Construccion &
Servicios SA and CVC Capital Partners Ltd. will exit  Abertis
Infraestructuras SA (ABE) ’s Saba Infraestructuras unit when it goes on
sale,  El Confidencial  said.  Abertis has received four binding offers for a stake in
Saba, the car park and logistics unit which Abertis segregated
from its core business earlier this year, and expects to make a
decision on the sale in coming days, El Confidencial said,
citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Spanish savings bank  La Caixa , which owns 28 percent of
Abertis and Saba, will keep its stake in the non-listed unit, El
Confidencial added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
