Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) ,
Egypt’s biggest publicly traded construction company, is
preparing a bid for Burrup Fertilisers Pty, a person with
knowledge of the plans said.  Orascom, based in Cairo, has appointed legal and financial
advisers ahead of a sale process, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the plans haven’t been announced.
 Barclays Capital  is advising Orascom, the person said, without
disclosing the bid price. Burrup is under receivership.  The fertilizer industry is consolidating as rising food
prices spur farmers to plant more crops, boosting demand for
soil nutrients. Russia’s two largest producers of potash, a
fertilizer ingredient, are merging in a $7.8 billion deal, while
BHP Billiton Ltd. tried and failed to buy Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. last year for $40 billion.  China ’s  Sinofert Holdings Ltd. (297) ,  Orica Ltd. (ORI) ,  Wesfarmers
Ltd. (WES) ,  Yara International ASA (YAR)  and  Incitec Pivot Ltd. (IPL)  are also
among the bidders for Burrup, the Australian Financial Review
reported yesterday.  Yara’s Chief Executive Officer Joergen Ole Haslestad said
April 29 that it expects an auction of Perth, Australia-based
Burrup “shortly.” Receivers PPB Advisory said in January they
got more than 20 “serious enquiries” from groups around the
world and are considering options for the sale.  Orica and Wesfarmers compete with Burrup in  Australia .  To contact the reporter for this story:
