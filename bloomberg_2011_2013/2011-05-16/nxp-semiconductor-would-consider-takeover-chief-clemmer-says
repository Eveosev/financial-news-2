NXP Semiconductors NV,  Europe ’s
third-largest chipmaker, would consider a takeover if a
potential buyer offered a large enough premium and gave the
company flexibility with customers and employees, Chief
Executive Officer Richard Clemmer said.  Clemmer is looking for ways to accelerate organic growth at
Eindhoven, Netherlands-based NXP by making chips that help
customers reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and let people connect
different mobile devices. He said he would consider a deal
similar to the $6.5 billion that Texas Instruments Inc. offered
National Semiconductor Corp. last month, a 78 percent premium to
National’s closing price before the deal was announced April 4.  “If someone came in like in the case of the TI-National
offer, where they offered an 80 percent premium associated with
it and allowed us to protect our customers and our employees, we
would be very much considering that,” he said on Bloomberg
Television’s “Street Smart” with  Matt Miller . Clemmer said the
company isn’t currently in any merger talks.  NXP said on May 4 that product revenue, which includes
sales of high-performance and standard chips, will increase by a
range of 2 percent to 5 percent this quarter from the first
quarter, without giving a year-earlier comparison. First-quarter
product sales were $979 million, up 9.5 percent from a year
earlier.  NXP fell $1.70, or 5.8 percent, to $27.66 at 4 p.m. New
York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have gained 32
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
