Peru’s economy expanded at the
slowest annual pace in 13 months in March after companies curbed
spending as they await the outcome of the country’s presidential
race.  Gross domestic product rose 7.9 percent in March from the
same month a year earlier, the government’s statistics agency
said in a report distributed today in  Lima . Expansion was in
line with the median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Peru’s surging private investment and a consumer boom
spurred 8.8 percent GDP growth last year, the fastest in  South
America . Finance Minister Ismael Benavides said in a May 3
interview that domestic demand is slowing as investors fret over
presidential candidate Ollanta Humala’s policies, leading the
government to cut its 2011 growth forecast to 6.5 percent from
7.5 percent.  “There is evidence that people are postponing investments,
and that could continue if Humala wins,” said  Roberto Melzi , a
Latin America strategist at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York.
“Why would you start a project now if you have a fair amount of
uncertainty?”  If Humala’s opponent, Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori wins the
race, domestic demand will probably accelerate, requiring the
Andean country’s central bank to raise borrowing costs “more
aggressively”, Melzi said.  The central bank raised its benchmark lending rate last
week by a quarter point to 4.25 percent, a two-year high, to
contain inflationary pressures.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7595 per dollar at
11:38 a.m.  New York  time from 2.7609 on May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
