Indonesia ’s rupiah declined as
concern  Greece ’s debt crisis will worsen sapped demand for
emerging-market assets. Bonds rose.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares dropped for
a third day before European finance ministers meet today to
discuss further support for Greece that may include new loans or
an extension of debt maturities.  “People are concerned about the Greece situation,” said
 Gundy Cahyadi , a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp, said. “The euro has declined, leading to negative
sentiment in Asian currencies, including the rupiah.”  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 8,571 per dollar as of 3:10
p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency has gained 4.7 percent this year as overseas
investors bought $1.9 billion more Indonesian shares than they
sold during the period to benefit from growth in  Southeast
Asia ’s biggest economy.  Gross domestic product rose 6.5 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier after having increased 6.89 percent
in the previous three months, official data showed this month.  The yield on Indonesia government’s benchmark 8.25 percent
bond due July 2021 fell four basis points to 7.62 percent today,
according to midday prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  Overseas investors raised holdings of Indonesia’s debt this
year by 19 percent to 223 trillion rupiah ($26 billion) as of
May 12, according to data from the Debt Management Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
