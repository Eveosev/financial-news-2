OAO Cherkizovo Group, the Russian
meat company that today completed its acquisition of smaller
competitor ZAO Mosselprom, said the transaction is valued at as
much as $253 million.  Cherkizovo bought the asset from businessmen Vadim
Zolotorev, Vadim Kamyshev and an investment firm, Chief
Executive Officer Sergey Mikhailov told reporters in Moscow,
declining to name the third seller.  The transaction includes $183.8 million of Mosselprom’s
debt, $42.1 million in cash and between 1.5 percent and 2
percent of Cherkizovo’s stock, valued at as much as $27 million,
Mikhailov said.  Cherkizovo expects to have debt of 25 billion rubles ($890
million) at year-end following the transaction, Chief Financial
Officer Ludmila Mikhailova said at the briefing.  After the transaction, Cherkizovo will have 10 percent of
the Russian market for chicken meat, compared with 7 percent
last year, Mikhailov said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
