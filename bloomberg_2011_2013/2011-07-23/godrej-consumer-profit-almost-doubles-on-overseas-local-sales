Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. (GCPL) , an
Indian maker of soaps and detergents, said group profit almost
doubled, beating analysts estimates, as strong domestic demand
and an acquisition in  Africa  increased sales.  Net income in the three months ended June surged to 2.39
billion rupees ($54 million) from 1.23 billion rupees a year
earlier, the Mumbai-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Earnings were almost twice the median estimate of 1.3
billion rupees from 12 analysts compiled by Bloomberg News.  Sales jumped 40 percent to 9.98 billion rupees, according
to the statement.  Godrej in June announced the acquisition of Darling Group
Holdings to expand hair care product sales in Africa.  The board recommended an interim dividend of 1 rupee a
share, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
