A strike by Air France stewards and
hostesses planned for July 29 to Aug. 1 was cancelled today
after unions and the airline reached an agreement on labor
rules, Agence France-Presse reported.  Six of the seven labor unions representing cabin crew have
reached an agreement with the carrier, the news service said,
citing unidentified airline officials. The pilotsâ€™ union SNPL
may also call off a strike planned for Aug. 5 through Aug. 8,
AFP reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
