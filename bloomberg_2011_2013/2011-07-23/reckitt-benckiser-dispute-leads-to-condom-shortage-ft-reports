A dispute between  Reckitt Benckiser
Group Plc (RB/)  and an Indian manufacturer is disrupting global condom
supplies, the  Financial Times  reported, citing a Citigroup Inc.
research report.  TTK Lig, a joint venture between Slough, England-based
Reckitt and several Indian investors, produces more than 50
percent of Reckitt Benckiser’s Durex brand, the newspaper said,
citing Citigroup figures.  TTK hasn’t supplied any condoms since the beginning of May,
the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
