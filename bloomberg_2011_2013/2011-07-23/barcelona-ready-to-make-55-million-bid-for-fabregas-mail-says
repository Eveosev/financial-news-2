Barcelona is preparing to make a
third bid of 33.5 million pounds ($55 million) for Arsenal
captain Cesc Fabregas, the  Daily Mail  said.  Barcelona vice president Joseph Maria Bartomeu and director
Raul Sanllehi were in  London  working on the offer with a view of
having it on the table tomorrow, the Mail said.  Arsenal, which has already rejected two bids, will take 35
million for the 24-year-old midfielder, but Barcelona hopes its
newest offer is enough, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
