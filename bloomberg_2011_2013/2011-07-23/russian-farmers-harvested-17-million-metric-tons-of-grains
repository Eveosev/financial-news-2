Russian farmers harvested 17 million
metric tons of grain so far this year, according to Agriculture
Minister  Yelena Skrynnik .  “I think we will meet the existing forecast of grain
harvest of between 85 million and 90 million tons,” Skrynnik
said at a meeting with Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , according
to an e-mailed government statement today.  The minister didn’t provide a year-earlier comparison for
the crop. The yield was 3.6 tons a hectare, up from 3.1 tons in
2009, according to the statement.  As of July 20 last year, 21 million tons of grain had been
harvested. The yield averaged 2.81 tons a hectare last year,
according to the ministry.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
