U.K. 10-year government bond yields
rose to the highest in two weeks as optimism that euro-area
leaders will contain the region’s debt crisis sapped British
securities’ haven appeal.  The benchmark U.K. securities slipped for the first week in
three as euro-area leaders announced 159 billion euros ($229
billion) in new aid for Greece late yesterday and empowered
their 440-billion euro rescue fund to buy debt across stressed
nations, helping to build a firewall around Spain and  Italy .
German bunds also declined as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and
FTSE 100 Index surged.  “Any partial reversal of the risk-off mood will see gilt
yields come under pressure in the short term,” said  Sam Hill , a
gilt strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. Higher stocks
and gains in euro area bonds would be “ consistent with gilt
yields rising,” he said.  The 10-year gilt yield rose three basis points this week to
3.11 percent as of 5:49 p.m. in London yesterday. They climbed
to 3.23 percent after the EU announcement, the highest level
since July 8. Two-year yields were little changed at 0.71
percent.  The pound slid 0.3 percent to trade at 88 pence per euro,
its first weekly decline in three. Sterling gained 1.1 percent
versus the dollar to $1.6318.  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields have lost around 58 basis
points since the end of March, as investors sought refuge from a
crisis that has seen the borrowing costs of  Europe ’s most
indebted nations surge to record levels.  Narrower Spreads  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold 10-
year Italian bonds instead of similar-maturity gilts slipped to
203 basis points based on July 22 closing Bloomberg generic
prices, after jumping as high as 294 basis points on July 18,
the most since the euro’s introduction. Spanish 10-year
securities yielded 240 basis points more than similar gilts,
down from 329 basis points on July 18.  Gilts may benefit next week with data forecast to show U.K.
growth slowed in the second quarter. The median estimate of 32
economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicts the U.K. expanded 0.2
percent, down from the 0.5 percent pace in the first quarter.  U.K. government bonds have handed investors 3.2 percent
this year, while Spanish securities returned 1.6 percent and
their Italian counterparts lost 0.8 percent, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds returned 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
