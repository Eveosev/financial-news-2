Adel Taarabt will remain at Queens
Park Rangers as the team prepares for its return to the Premier
League.  QPR majority shareholders Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio
Briatore said in a statement Taarabt won’t be sold during the
summer transfer period. The 22-year-old had been linked in media
reports with several European clubs, including Paris St.
Germain.  “Despite receiving a substantial bid for our Moroccan
international, we rebuffed all approaches and indeed, we are
keen to build for the future in the Premier League and not sell
one of our prized assets,” the statement said.  Taarabt was the player of the year in the second-tier
Championship last season after scoring 19 goals as QPR gained
promotion to the Premier League by winning the league title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
