Germans expect the euro-area debt
crisis to have “serious consequences” for the currency,  Welt
am Sonntag  said, citing a survey by market research company  GfK .  Altogether, 71 percent of the 1,068 surveyed see “serious
consequences” for the euro, while 47 percent expect the euro to
lose value through inflation, the Berlin-based newspaper
reported. Thirty-one percent of those surveyed expect some
countries to have to exit the  euro zone , while 20 percent
believe the euro zone will fall apart entirely, Welt am Sonntag
cited the survey as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
