India reached 193-5 at tea to trail
 England  by 281 runs on day three of their opening cricket Test
at Lord’s in London.  Rahul Dravid is 59 not out in India’s response to England’s
474-8 declared.  Stuart Broad  took 3-28 and got Sachin Tendulkar,
who finished with 34 in his attempt to become the first player
with 100 centuries in international cricket.  The match is the 2,000th in the 134 years of elite Test
cricket. England can overtake India as the top team in the
International Cricket Council rankings if it wins the four-match
series by two Tests or more.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
