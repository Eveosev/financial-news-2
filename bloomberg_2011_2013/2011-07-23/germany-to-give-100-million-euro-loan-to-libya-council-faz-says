Germany  plans to provide a loan of
as much as 100 million euros ($143 million) to Libya’s
Transitional National Council,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung  reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  The loan will be secured against Libyan funds in Germany
that were frozen as a result of  United Nations  and European
Union sanctions, the newspaper said, according to an e-mailed
preview of an article that will appear in tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
