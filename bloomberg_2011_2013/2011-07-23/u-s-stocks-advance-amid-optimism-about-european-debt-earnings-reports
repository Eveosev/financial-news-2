U.S. stocks rose this week,
including the biggest one-day gain since March for the Standard

quarterly gain in trading revenue among major U.S. banks. AMD

macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns recede a bit in part
because they are getting addressed. People have been heartened
by the impressive earnings and there’s been a lot of M&A
activity. Almost every day there seems to be a deal, so that
also tends to stimulate interest in the market.”  Earnings Season  Corporate profit reports helped drive U.S. stocks higher.
