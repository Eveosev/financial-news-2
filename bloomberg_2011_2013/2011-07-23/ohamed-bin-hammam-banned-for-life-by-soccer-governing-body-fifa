Mohamed Bin Hammam, a member of
FIFA’s executive committee, was banned for live after a probe
into claims he tried to bribe voters in his attempt to defeat
incumbent Sepp Blatter for the presidency of soccer’s ruling
body.  The decision was announced today by Petrus Damaseb, deputy
chairman of the Zurich-based body’s ethics committee. It follows
a six-week investigation by former U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation head Louis Freeh into allegations Bin Hammam
offered stacks of $40,000 to members of the Caribbean Football
Union.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
