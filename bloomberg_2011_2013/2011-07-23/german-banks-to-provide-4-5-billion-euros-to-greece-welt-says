German banks, insurers and funds
will contribute around 4.5 billion euros ($6.5 billion) to the
aid package for  Greece , Die Welt reported, without saying where
it obtained the information.  The figure represents the total of Greek bonds held by
German investors that expire by 2020, the Berlin-based newspaper
reported. German lenders anticipate writing off about 21
percent, or 945 million euros, of their contribution, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
