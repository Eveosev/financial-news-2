Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , the Saudi
company known as Mobily, said it renewed its management
agreement with its founder, Emirates Telecommunications Corp. of
the  United Arab Emirates , also known as Etisalat.  The agreement runs for five years and starts Dec. 23,
Riyadh-based Mobily said in a statement on the Saudi bourse’s
website today. “A committee will be formed by the two companies
to develop the business relationship between them to the benefit
of customers and shareholders of Mobily,” the company added.  Mobily, in which Etisalat holds a 27.4 percent stake,
competes with state-run  Saudi Telecom Co. (STC)  and Zain  Saudi Arabia ,
a unit of Kuwait’s Zain, in the world’s biggest oil exporter,
home to 27 million people.  Mobily’s board has approved a first-half dividend of 1.25
riyals a share and proposed to shareholders a full-year dividend
payout ratio of “not less than 40 percent,” the company said
in a separate statement.  On July 19, Mobily reported a 29 percent increase in
second-quarter profit to 1.16 billion riyals ($310 million)
compared with a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
