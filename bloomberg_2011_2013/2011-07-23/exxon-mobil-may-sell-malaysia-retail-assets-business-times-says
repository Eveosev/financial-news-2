Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s
biggest energy company by market value, will make a decision
soon on selling part of its retail business in Malaysia, the
Business Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Exxon could raise about 1 billion ringgit ($336.5 million)
by selling its network of 560 service stations in the Southeast
Asian nation, according to the newspaper. That compares with
Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s more than 900 gas stations in the
country and  Boustead Holdings Bhd. (BOUS) ’s 330, it said.  Divesting the retail business would enable the Irving,
Texas-based company to focus on oil and gas exploration,
production and refining operations in Malaysia, according to the
report. Two calls to Exxon offices in  Kuala Lumpur  weren’t
immediately returned outside of business hours.  The company will jointly invest more than 10 billion
ringgit in a production-sharing project with Petronas Carigali
Sdn., the exploration arm of state oil and gas company Petroliam
Nasional Bhd., Prime Minister Najib Razak said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
