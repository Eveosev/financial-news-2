As many as one million Poles may
have moved abroad permanently since  Poland  joined the European
Union in 2004, with many settling in the U.K. and Ireland, the
 Daily Telegraph  reported, citing the Warsaw Centre for
International Relations.  The population of Poland has declined by two million to 36
million people since the countryâ€™s accession, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
