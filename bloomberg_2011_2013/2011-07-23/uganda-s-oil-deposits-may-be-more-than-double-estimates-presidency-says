Uganda  may hold deposits of as many
as 6 billion barrels of oil, more than double the current
estimate, according to the office of the nation’s presidency.  “Some analysts estimate that Uganda’s Albertine Graben may
hold more than 6 billion barrels of oil,” the presidential
office said in an e-mail statement yesterday. The estimate is
well above the discovered deposits with a potential of 2.5
billion barrels, it said.  East Africa’s third-biggest economy still has four
unexplored oil blocks after it awarded concessions to five,
according to the statement. The country plans to produce 100,000
to 150,000 barrels of oil a day, which is expected to spur
economic growth, the office said.  Uganda is scheduled to become an oil producer next year
when  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  is expected to start pumping crude and gas
from the Lake Albert Basin. The country has an estimated 2.5
billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion barrels in proven
reserves, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
