China  executed 14 people with assets
of at least a 1 billion yuan ($155 million) during the past
eight years as the government expanded its fight against
corruption, according to the New Culture News newspaper.  The dead include Yuan Baojing, a former stockbroker
executed by lethal injection in 2006 for the murder of a man who
had tried to blackmail him, according to the  report . Wang
Zhendong, chairman of the Yingkou Donghua Trading Group, was
executed in 2008 for a scheme that persuaded investors to buy
and breed ants, the report said.  The newspaper, based in the northern city of Changchun,
said it surveyed media reports over the past eight years to
compile the data. Chinaâ€™s government is waging a corruption
crackdown that resulted in the punishment of 146,517 people last
year, the official Xinhua News Agency reported in June.  China boasts 1,900 yuan billionaires, double the number
from 2009, according to the 2010  Hurun Wealth Report.  The
newspaper said 39 Chinese billionaires died of unnatural causes,
including 17 suicides, 15 murders, and seven accidents. Work-
related illnesses accounted for the deaths of 19 Chinese with
wealth of at least 1 billion yuan, the newspaper said.  --Emma Dong. Editors: Nicholas Wadhams,  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
