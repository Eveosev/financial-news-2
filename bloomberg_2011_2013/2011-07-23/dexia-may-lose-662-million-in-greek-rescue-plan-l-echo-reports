Dexia SA (DEXB) , the bank that took the
most Federal Reserve discount-window help in October 2008, may
face losses of as much as 461 million euros ($662 million) on
its holdings of Greek bonds if it joins a euro-area bailout
plan,  L’Echo reported , citing its own calculations.  Dexia holds a maximum of 2.2 billion euros of Greek debt
that matures before the end of 2020 and would fall under the
voluntary private-sector component of the 159 billion euro
rescue, the Brussels-based newspaper reported today, citing its
own estimate.  Given that participating banks will agree to write down the
value of their Greek securities by 21 percent as part of the
bond exchange and debt buyback program, according to the
Institute of International Finance, Dexia would face as much as
461 million euros of losses, L’Echo said.  Europe ’s 90 biggest banks hold about 98 billion euros of
Greek debt, according to the European Banking Authority. They
stand to lose 20.6 billion euros on their Greek  government bonds 
after lenders in the region pledged to contribute to a new
rescue package.  Dexia hasn’t committed to participate in the support
measures for  Greece . The bank is waiting for the European
Banking Authority to issue conclusions on the plan, L’Echo said,
citing spokesman Benoit Gausseron.  To contact the reporter on this story:
