Turkey  is establishing an 11,000-
person police unit that will carry out intelligence duties and
combat terror alongside the military in rural areas, Hurriyet
reported, citing Interior Ministry officials it didnâ€™t identify.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  last year asked the
ministry, which controls the police, to start work on a special-
forces unit aimed at broadening resources to fight terror, the
Istanbul-based newspaper  said . A commission comprised of the
military, justice and interior ministries, police force,
intelligence and gendarmerie started work on a legal framework,
Hurriyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
