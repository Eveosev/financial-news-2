The European Union’s latest aid
package for  Greece  is “incomplete,” according to  Germany ’s
opposition leader Frank-Walter Steinmeier,  Tagesspiegel am
Sonntag  reported.  Steinmeier said the measures for reconstruction of the
 Greek economy  and the “initiation of investments” are “at
best vague,” the newspaper said in an e-mailed preview of an
article that will be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
