European Central Bank Executive
Board Member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi warned against providing a
Greek-style debt-relief package to other euro-area countries,
 Welt am Sonntag  reported.  Bini Smaghi said in an interview that the aid package for
 Greece  should be seen as a “one-off” measure, the newspaper
reported, according to the e-mailed preview of an article that
will appear in tomorrow’s edition.  Bini Smaghi said he was “surprised” by former ECB chief
economist Otmar Issing’s comment that Greece should quit the
euro area after a debt restructuring, Welt am Sonntag reported.
He said this would result in a run on Greek banks and a collapse
of the Greek banking system, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
