European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  called for a “quantum leap” in the
supervision of euro-zone economies,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said.  The European Union should have more regulatory control over
national budgets and it is “essential” that Greece adapts the
program “one-to-one,” the newspaper reported, citing an
interview with Trichet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
