French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said the euro aid plan decided last week will not have an
impact on the country’s deficit, Le Monde quoted him as saying
in an  interview published today .  “France doesn’t need to borrow more and our deficit isn’t
impacted,” Baroin told the newspaper. “Neither the European
Financial Stability Facility nor obviously France will be
impoverished by this plan.”  The French government plans to trim the deficit to 5.7
percent of gross domestic product next year and below 3 percent
in 2013, Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  said yesterday. The euro
aid plan will add 15 billion euros ($22 billion) to the
country’s’ debt by 2014, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
