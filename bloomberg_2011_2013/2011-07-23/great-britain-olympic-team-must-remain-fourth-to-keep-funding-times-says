The U.K. Olympics team needs to gain
at least fourth place in the  Olympic Games  next year to maintain
current annual funding levels, the  London  Times reported, citing
U.K. Sports Minister Hugh Robertson.  If the team fails to deliver at the London event, it may
lead to a reduction in the 120 million pounds ($195 million) of
funding, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
