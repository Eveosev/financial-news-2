Egypt ’s ruling military council
denied that force was used against protesters in the capital,
Cairo, yesterday, Al Jazeera news channel reported.  The council, formed in February after the ouster of Egypt’s
former president  Hosni Mubarak , issued a statement in response
to allegations that security forces are cracking down on
protesters, Al Jazeera said.  Clashes took place between security forces and
demonstrators trying to reach the military council’s
headquarters in Cairo after military police cut off all roads
leading to the building and encircled protesters.  “The accusations that security forces were using force
against demonstrators are baseless, whether in Ismailiyah, Suez
or any other city,” the council said.     The statement also
attacked the 6th of April opposition movement, accusing it of
creating tensions in the country.  Demonstrators were protesting yesterday the arrest of
people who tried to enter the national security headquarters in
Suez,  Al Jazeera  said without saying where it obtained the
information.
People were injured in Alexandria when police used force to
clear protesters, Al Jazeera reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
