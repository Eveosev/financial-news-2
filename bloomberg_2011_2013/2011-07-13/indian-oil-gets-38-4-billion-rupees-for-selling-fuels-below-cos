Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s
biggest refiner, got about 38.4 billion rupees ($861 million) in
cash from the government as partial compensation for selling
fuels below cost in the three months ended March 31.  The amount given by the government yesterday takes the
total received this month to 76 billion rupees, Finance Director
P.K. Goyal said. The state-run company will get a total of about
109 billion rupees this month, he said today.  The money will help state refiners cut debt taken to meet
expenses while awaiting the compensation after selling fuels
including diesel, kerosene and cooking gas below cost. Indian
Oil had about 700 billion rupees of debt as of June 21, Goyal
said that day.  Bharat Petroleum  Corp. will get about 47 billion rupees as
compensation this month and has received 32.6 billion rupees,
Finance Director S.K. Joshi said by telephone. The remainder may
come in the next week, he said.  “It’s an immediate relief,” Joshi said. “We have to see
how it goes from here.”  Indian Oil gained 0.4 percent to 340.80 rupees at 11:18
a.m. in Mumbai trading and Bharat Petroleum rose 0.1 percent to
669 rupees. The benchmark Sensitive Index climbed 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
