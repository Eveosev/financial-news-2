Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the largest
network-equipment company, joined forces with  Schneider Electric
SA (SU)  to provide technology to reduce the amount of energy wasted
by IT, lighting and security systems.  The technology offers the potential to cut IT costs by as
much as 30 percent and overall building costs by about 9
percent, according to a statement today by Paris-based Schneider
Electric, a French maker of industrial components.  “This is widely recognized as being an area where there is
huge untapped opportunity,” said Albert Cheung, an industry
analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “Schneider and Cisco
have both trying to establish their positions in the smart grid
and smart  energy industry  over the last couple of years.”  Buildings account for as much as 42 percent of energy
consumption worldwide, according to the statement. Developing
energy management systems uses information and communication
technology to help owners monitor, manage and improve their
energy useage.  “By working with industry leading companies like  Schneider
Electric , we are providing building owners and managers the
ability to monitor, report and control their buildings’ entire
energy usage,” Jeff Reed, vice president of Cisco’s Unified
Access Business Unit, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
