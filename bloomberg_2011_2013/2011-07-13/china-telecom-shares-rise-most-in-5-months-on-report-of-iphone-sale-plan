China  Telecom Corp., the smallest of
the country’s three mobile-phone carriers, rose the most in five
months in  Hong Kong  trading after a report said it may start
selling  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone this year.  The carrier rose as much as 5.5 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since Jan. 27, and traded at HK$4.91, up 4.7
percent, as of the midday trading break. That compared with a 1
percent gain in Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index.  China Telecom is expected to introduce the iPhone in
November, Reuters reported today, citing a person it didn’t
identify. The plan depends on an agreement with Apple, the
report said.  Beijing-based China Telecom, which is also China’s biggest
fixed-line phone carrier, is in talks with Apple to offer a CDMA
version of the iPhone, Chief Executive Officer Wang Xiaochu said
in May. The discussions are ongoing and there is “no
timetable” for selling the product, Ivan Wong, an investor
relations manager at China Telecom in Hong Kong, said today in a
phone interview.  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. is the only Chinese phone
carrier that now offers the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling
product.  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s largest mobile-phone
company by users, may get an iPhone for its fourth-generation
TD-LTE network, which is expected to be rolled out next year,
China Mobile Chairman  Wang Jianzhou  said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
