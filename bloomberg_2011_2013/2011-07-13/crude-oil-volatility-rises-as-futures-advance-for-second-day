Oil options volatility rose as
August futures increased for a second day after a U.S. Energy
Department report showed inventories fell more than expected
last week and equities rallied.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30 percent as of 5 p.m. in  New
York , up from 29.9 percent yesterday. August options expire at
the end of this week.  Crude for August delivery rose 62 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $98.05 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have risen 27 percent in the past year. September futures
rose 64 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $98.49 a barrel.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
August $98 puts, with 3,094 lots changing hands. They fell 49
cents to $1.12 a barrel. October $85 puts, the next-most active
option, slipped 4 cents to $1.14 a barrel with 2,102 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  December $100 calls were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 6,650 lots changing hands. They
