Delek Real Estate Ltd. (DLKR) ’s board asked
management for updated recommendations for its strategic plans
as Isaac Tshuva’s property company continues selling assets to
repay debt.  Management should submit its recommendations by July 21,
taking into account the company’s debt obligations, assets and
the possibility of raising funds, Delek Real Estate said today
in an e-mailed statement.  The company’s Delek Global Real Estate Ltd. unit completed
the sale of the Bell Tower in  Canada  for C$278 million ($289
million) and is close to finishing the planned sales of its
holdings in 30 Jean Coutu branches and an additional Canadian
building for a total of 589 million shekels ($171 million),
according to the statement.  Delek has been selling Canadian properties to help repay
some 1.7 billion shekels of outstanding debt, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Upon completion of the sale of the
Canadian assets, the company will have raised about 5 billion
shekels since the start of 2010, according to the statement.  “We are continuing to advance our plans to sell assets in
Canada and other countries to create a surplus  cash flow  that
will help the company meet its obligations,” Chief Executive
Officer Eran Meytal said in the statement.  Delek Real Estate shares gained for the first time in eight
days, advancing 6.3 percent to 0.237 shekel at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  Tel Aviv . The stock has lost 83 percent this year,
compared with a 5.7 percent decline for  Israel ’s benchmark TA-25
stock Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
