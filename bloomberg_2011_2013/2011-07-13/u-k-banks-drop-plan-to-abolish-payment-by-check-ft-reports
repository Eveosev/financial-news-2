A U.K. plan to abolish bank checks
has been abandoned after members of parliament received more
than 1,000 letters of protest from the public, the Financial
Times reported.  The 350 year-old payment system was to have been phased out
by the end of 2018; however, the U.K. Payments Council, a body
dominated by banks, said yesterday that checks will be available
“for as long as customers need them,” the newspaper reported.  One billion checks were written in 2010, down from 4
billion a year in the 1990s, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
