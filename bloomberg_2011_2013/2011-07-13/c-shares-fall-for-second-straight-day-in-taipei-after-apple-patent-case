HTC Corp. (2498)  shares fell for a second
day after  Asia ’s second-largest maker of smartphones was accused
of infringing Apple Inc. patents in a case that may halt U.S.
imports of the Taiwanese company’s phones and its new Flyer
tablet computers.  The stock dropped 5.9 percent to NT$861, set for the lowest
close since Jan. 14, extending yesterday’s 6.9 percent loss. HTC
continues to “vehemently deny” all of Apple’s past and present
claims against it and will continue to protect and defend its
own intellectual property, said Grace Lei, HTC’s general
counsel. UBS AG said in a report dated yesterday it estimated
“downside impact” to the company’s earnings from declining
European handset demand, according to the report by analyst
Arthur Hsieh. He maintained the share at “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
