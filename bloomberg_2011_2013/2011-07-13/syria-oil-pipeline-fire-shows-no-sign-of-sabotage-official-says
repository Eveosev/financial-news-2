Syria ’s oil production was
uninterrupted as workers extinguished a fire that broke out on a
domestic crude pipeline in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor,
the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported.  Oil was shipped through alternative links, the agency said,
citing an unidentified oil ministry official. There will be
investigations to determine the cause of the fire, which may
have resulted from the burning of dry weed or from a leak where
there is maintenance on the link, it said.  The fire “might be caused by nearby agricultural
projects,” Deputy Oil Minister Hassan Zainab said in a
telephone interview from Damascus earlier today. “There is no
sabotage, there is no explosion.”  Syria has been engulfed this year by protests in demand of
political reform. The country holds the ninth-largest oil
reserves in the  Middle East , according to data from BP Plc, and
is trying to halt a decline in its crude output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
