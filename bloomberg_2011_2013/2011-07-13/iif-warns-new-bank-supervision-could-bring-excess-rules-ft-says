The  Institute of International
Finance  has said tougher regulation of the banking industry,
while important to helping stability, could result in an excess
of rules, the FT reported, citing an IIF report.  “There is a significant risk that increased activity and
the imposition of more requirements will themselves be mistaken
for more effective supervision,” the report said, according to
the FT.
