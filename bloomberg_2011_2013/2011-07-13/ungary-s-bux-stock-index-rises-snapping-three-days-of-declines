Hungarian shares rose the most in
six weeks on speculation the U.S. and  China  can lead a recovery
in the global economy and offset the impact of the debt crisis
in Europe. The forint rallied.  The benchmark BUX index of shares gained 2.3 percent to
22,276.10 by the 5 p.m. close in Budapest. Mol Nyrt., the
country’s biggest refiner, rose 4.1 percent to 21,450 forint and
OTP Nyrt., the biggest lender, 2.4 percent to 5,625 forint.
Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 267.71 per euro.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress the
central bank is prepared to take additional action, including
buying more  government bonds , if the economy appears to be in
danger of stalling.  China’s economy  expanded 9.5 percent last
quarter, exceeding the 9.3 percent median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey.  “China didn’t slam the brakes as much as the market
feared,”  Akos Kuti , analyst at Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. in
Budapest, wrote in a research note today.  The expectation of another round of monetary easing from
the Fed may also help offset the market impact of the euro-area
debt crisis, Kuti added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
