(Corrects to show that Caixin reported Everbright Bank will
make a decision on its  Hong Kong  initial offering in a month)  Joy Global Inc. (JOYG)  is in talks to buy
 International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd. (1683) , the Chinese maker
of coal-mining equipment, according to two people with knowledge
of the matter.  A deal may be announced as soon as this week, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the discussions
are private. International Mining, controlled by private-equity
firm Jordan Co., has a market value of HK$8.5 billion ($1.1
billion), based on its July 11 closing stock price. The shares
were suspended from trading July 12 and yesterday.
