European stocks advanced, halting
three days of losses for the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
as China posted economic growth that beat forecasts. U.S. index
futures and Asian shares rose.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  surged 3.6 percent as the U.K.’s largest
luxury-goods maker reported first-quarter sales that beat
analysts’ estimates.  ASML Holding NV (ASML)  tumbled 4.2 percent after
Europe’s biggest semiconductor-equipment maker reported second-
quarter orders that missed its own forecast.  The Stoxx 600 increased 0.3 percent to 268.94 at 10:31 a.m.
in London. The gauge had fallen 2.8 percent over the past three
days as investors speculated that the euro area’s sovereign-debt
crisis would spread to the bigger economies of Italy and Spain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
