Yum! Brands Inc., owner of the KFC
and  Pizza Hut  restaurant chains, said second-quarter profit
gained 10 percent and boosted its earnings forecast for the year
as customer traffic increased at restaurants in China.  Net income advanced to $316 million, or 65 cents a share,
from $286 million, or 59 cents, a year earlier, the Louisville,
Kentucky-based company said today in a statement. Profit
excluding some items was 66 cents a share, topping the 61-cent
average of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Yum, with more than 18,000 locations outside the U.S., said
sales at stores in China open at least a year grew 18 percent.
In April, Yum said it would buy Little Sheep Group Ltd., which
has about 450 hot pot restaurants in mainland  China . About one-
third of the company’s revenue came from the nation last year.  “The fastest-growing segment of the Chinese population is
that middle class and they’re making more money,” said Steve West, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in  St. Louis  who
advises holding Yum shares. People like to eat at KFC and Pizza
Hut because of their “cool, hip factor” in China, he said.  Yum opened 99 new restaurants in China during the quarter
and has more than 4,000 KFC and Pizza Hut stores in the nation.  Earnings per share excluding some items will increase at
least 12 percent this year, Yum said today. That’s up from a
previous projection for a gain of at least 10 percent.  Yum rose $1.47, or 2.6 percent, to $57.05 at 5:08 p.m. in
trading after the regular close of the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares gained 13 percent this year through the close of
regular trading today.  Commodity Costs  Yum, along with rivals Wendy’s Co. and McDonald’s Corp.,
has faced rising food prices in the past year. Yum said today
commodity costs this year would rise as much as 7 percent in the
U.S. and 9 percent in China. The company previously predicted
prices would rise 6 percent in the U.S. and 7 percent in China
for the full year.  Chief Executive Officer David Novak in January put Yum’s
Long John Silver’s and A&W All-American Food restaurants up for
sale to focus on its China business.  Revenue rose 9.4 percent to $2.82 billion in the quarter
ended June 11. Yum has about 38,000 locations worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
