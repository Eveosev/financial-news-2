Ghana ’s cedi weakened the most in a
month as cement companies bought dollars for imports of raw
materials.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 0.7 percent to 1.5265 per dollar, the
lowest since June 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It traded at 1.5165 by 1 p.m. in Accra, the capital.  “Cement companies were on the market today buying the
dollar to pay their raw material suppliers abroad,” Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader at the local unit of Access Bank Plc,
said in a telephone interview. Those companies accounted for a
majority of dollar purchases, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
