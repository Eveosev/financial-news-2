Gulfsands Petroleum Plc (GPX)  of the U.K.
began drilling a well in north-eastern  Syria  in an attempt to
find commercial oil discoveries, the state-owned General
Petroleum Corp. said.  The company began drilling Safa-1 exploration well in the
Khurbet East development on July 4, the Damascus-based General
Petroleum, which oversees the industry, said in a statement on
its website today.  The pre-drill resource estimate for the Safa area is
calculated to be 27 million barrels of oil, Gulfsands said in a
statement on July 11.  Gulfsands produces oil in Syria from the Khurbet East and
Yousefieh fields from which output was in excess of 21,000
barrels of oil a day during June, the statement said. The
company expects its production to increase to approximately
24,000 barrels a day by the end of 2011, it said.  Syriaâ€™s oil reserves are the ninth-largest in the  Middle
East , according to data from BP Plc, and the country is trying
to halt its declining crude output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
