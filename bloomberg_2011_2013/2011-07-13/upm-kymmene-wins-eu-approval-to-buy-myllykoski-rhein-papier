UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V) ,  Europe ’s second-
biggest papermaker, won European Union approval to buy
Myllykoski Oyj and Rhein Papier GmbH, regulators said.  The European Commission said an in-depth probe showed that
customers would continue to have sufficient suppliers for
magazine paper and other products, it said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “I’m satisfied that there will remain sufficient
competition after the acquisition,” said EU Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia .  Helsinki-based UPM is aiming to expand as a “cost-
competitive pulp producer,” it said last month. Papermakers are
under pressure to combine as costs rise for pulp, wood and
recycled paper and demand for paper slows with more consumers
turning to digital versions of books, magazines and newspapers.  The Finnish papermaker said it expects its purchase of
 Finland ’s Myllykoski and Germany’s Rhein Papier to generate
annual cost savings of more than 100 million euros ($141
million) from 2012. Myllykoski and Rhein, controlled by the same
shareholders, have seven publication-paper mills in Germany,
Finland and the U.S.  UPM rose 4.5 percent to 12.25 euros at 12:56 p.m. in
Helsinki.  UPM declined to immediately comment as the company hadn’t
yet been informed by the European Commission of the merger
approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
