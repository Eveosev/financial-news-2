Industrias Penoles SAB,  Mexico ’s
largest silver producer, rose to a record as silver surged on
renewed concern about European debt and better-than-expected
economic growth in China.  Penoles advanced 4.2 percent, its biggest gain since May 9,
to 477.24 pesos in Mexico City trading at 4 p.m. New York time.
Silver futures for September delivery rose 7.1 percent on the
Comex, the biggest gain since March 19, 2009.  Penoles is benefitting from both investor uncertainty about
European debt following Ireland’s credit rating downgrade
yesterday by Moody’s Investors Service as well as a report that
 China’s economy  grew more than expected in the second quarter,
said Rodrigo Heredia, an analyst at Ixe Grupo Financiero SAB in
Mexico City.  “Silver is a haven for investors but it’s also used for
industrial purposes, so the very good indicators from  China  are
also contributing to the boost in its price,” Heredia said.
“Penoles shares are gaining for both reasons.”  Heredia has a “buy” rating on Penoles shares with a year-
end target price of 520 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
