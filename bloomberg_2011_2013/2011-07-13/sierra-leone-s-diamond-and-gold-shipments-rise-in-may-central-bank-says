Shipments of diamonds from  Sierra
Leone , West Africa’s second-biggest producer of the gems, rose
19 percent to 33,450 carats in May from a month earlier, the
country’s central bank said.  The exports included 13,010 carats of industrial diamonds
and 20,440 carats of gem diamonds, the Bank of Sierra Leone said
in a monthly economic review handed to reporters in Freetown,
the capital, today.  The country exported 400,842 carats of diamonds in 2009,
with a value of $78.4 million, according to the  Kimberley
Process , which was established to stem the trade in so-called
 conflict diamonds  from countries including Sierra Leone.
Neighboring Guinea was the region’s top diamond producer
according to Kimberley Process data from 2009, the most  recent 
available, with 696,731 carats.  Gold exports climbed 25 percent to 549,790 ounces in May,
according to the report. Shipment of rutile, a titanium ore,
declined 4 percent to 5,030 metric tons while bauxite, which is
used in aluminum production, dropped to 140,030 tons in May from
141,640 tons a month earlier, the bank said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
