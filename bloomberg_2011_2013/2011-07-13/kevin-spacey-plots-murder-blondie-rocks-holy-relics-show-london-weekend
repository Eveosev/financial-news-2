Kevin Spacey  plays a glowering
hunchback in his latest London stage appearance.  The Hollywood actor stars in Sam Mendes’s take on
Shakespeare’s “Richard III,” a production loosely timed
between the 1930s and now.  Wearing a crown and a metal leg brace, Spacey draws hearty
laughs even as he conspires to commit another murder.  The sets -- three walls of wooden doors -- create a
suitably stifling atmosphere.  “Richard III” is at the Old Vic Theatre. Information:

might enjoy in  Japan . Besides sushi and sashimi, there are
dumplings, noodles, salads and curries. It’s inexpensive and
unpretentious, and the fish comes from sustainable sources.

preserved in a reliquary now at the  British Museum .  Together with the hair of St. John the Evangelist and
spikes from the Crown of Thorns, these Christian relics feature
in the “Treasures of Heaven” exhibition. Curators carefully
steer clear of verifying their authenticity, focusing instead on
the ornate gold and silver containers.  Lest you think worshiping dead people is ancient history,
the show ends with a slew of contemporary cult figures,
including Lenin,  Elvis Presley  and  Princess Diana .  “Treasures of Heaven” ends Oct. 9 at the  British Museum .

the three-day  Lovebox  festival -- though they won’t all occupy 
it at once. Snoop Dogg headlines Saturday, the day that Marley 
also appears; Debbie Harry's band is on Sunday.      The East London event, founded in 2002 by electropop act
Groove Armada, always offers plenty of dance music. This year’s
edition promises infectious disco tunes from Santigold and the 
Scissor Sisters. The lineup is a mishmash: from Marc Almond and
 Beth Ditto  to pop divas Jessie J, Katy B and Kelis.  Lovebox,  Victoria Park , Grove Road, E3. Information:
 http://www.lovebox.net  or +44-844-822-1233. Tickets cost from
28.50 pounds ($45.90) for Friday only to 185 pounds for the VIP
weekend package; some combinations are sold out.  Sunday  The Proms -- that two-month-long concert series -- start
this weekend with the aim of surpassing the record 313,000
tickets sold last year.  Highlights of the 116-year-old festival include a late-
night celebration of Steve Reich’s 75th birthday, performances
by violinist Nigel Kennedy and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and an evening
of Ennio Morricone film music by  Australia ’s Spaghetti Western
Orchestra (using such instruments as asthma inhalers and cereal
packs).  The Proms are at the Royal Albert Hall through Sept. 10.

Chinese restaurant convenient for the Albert Hall. Many go for
the dim sum, while Beijing duck is the house special. The bonus:
beautiful views across Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park.
