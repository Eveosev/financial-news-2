Ukraine is keeping its grain harvest
forecast at 45 million metric tons, First Deputy Agriculture
Minister Mykola Bezuhlyi said.  Farmers harvested 6.9 million tons of grains from 2.4
million hectares (5.9 million acres) this season through
yesterday, or 21 percent of the planted area, Bezuhlyi said in a
 statement  on the Cabinet of Ministers website.  Winter barley yields increased to 2.7 tons a hectare from
2.3 tons a hectare last year and output was 2.8 million tons, he
said. The harvest is about 85 percent complete. Spring barley
yields declined to 2.2 tons a hectare from 2.3 tons a hectare
last year, according to the statement.  Farmers harvested 398,000 tons of winter rapeseed from
303,000 hectares, or 38 percent of planted areas, Bezuhlyi said.  Ukraine will produce 12 million tons of milling wheat, and
20 million tons of all wheat, Bezuhlyi said. Ukraine uses 5
million tons of milling wheat a year for domestic consumption,
