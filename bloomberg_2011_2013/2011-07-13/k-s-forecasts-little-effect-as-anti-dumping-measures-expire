K+S AG,  Europe ’s largest potash
producer, said it expects little effect from the expiration
of anti-dumping measures imposed on Russian and Belarusian
potassium chloride deliveries to the European Union.  “Due to the currently very good overall state of the
market, we believe that the effects on operating business
will be moderate,” said Michael Wudonig, a spokesman for
K+S. He was speaking on behalf of the European Potash
Producers Association, or APEP, which filed the request for
the measures against Russian and Belarusian producers.  Quotas on duty-free exports of shipments from Russia
and Belarus to the EU, as well as anti-dumping duties on
imports into the EU above a certain level, expired today,
the European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, said in a
statement.  Potash producers represented by the APEP include
Kassel, Germany-based K+S and  Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
