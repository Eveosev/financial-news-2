U.K. jobless claims rose at their
fastest pace since May 2009 last month, a sign the recovery is
struggling to generate enough jobs to offset the deepest
government budget cuts since World War II.  Jobless benefit claims rose by 24,500 from May to 1.52
million, the highest level since March 2010, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today in London. The median forecast of
21 economists in a Bloomberg News Survey was for a gain of
15,000. Unemployment measured by International Labour
Organization methods fell by 26,000 to 2.45 million people in
the quarter through May.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  is counting on private
companies to keep creating jobs as his government eliminates
more than 300,000 public-sector posts to tackle the  budget
deficit . Recent reports suggesting growth slowed in the second
quarter have cast doubt on the outlook for the labor market.  “The underlying market picture is still quite weak,”
 Hetal Mehta , an economist at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Ltd.
in London, said before the data was released. “We still haven’t
seen the vast majority of the public-sector job cuts come
through. We will see unemployment rise and that will be a major
factor for the  Bank of England  to keep policy on hold.”  The claimant-count rate was unchanged at 4.7 percent in
June. Part of the June increase in the claimant count was due to
rule changes affecting women as recipients of lone-parent
benefits were moved onto the jobless roll, the statistics office
said.  Job Losses  Cameron’s refusal to compromise on the pace of deficit-
cutting is testing the economic recovery as high inflation
erodes household incomes at the fastest pace since the 1970s.  The British economy probably grew just 0.1 percent in the
second quarter, the National Institute for Economic and Social
Research said last week. Bombardier, the world’s biggest
trainmaker, said this month it will eliminate more than 1,400
jobs at a U.K. after it lost a government contract. Meanwhile,
chocolate retailer Thorntons Plc and Carpetright Plc plan to
close stores in response to a slump in  consumer spending .  Based on ILO methods, the  unemployment rate  slipped to 7.7
percent in the three months through May from 7.8 percent in the
period through February. That compares with 9.9 percent in the
euro region, 9.2 percent in the U.S. and 4.5 percent in  Japan ,
the statistics office said.  The drop in the ILO unemployment reflected a 42,000 decline
in joblessness among people aged 16 to 24 as they left the  labor
force  to join full-time education, the statistics office said.  Wage Growth  Claimant unemployment rose 22,500 in May rather than the
19,600 previously reported, the statistics office said.  Employment between March and May rose 50,000, taking the
total of people in work to 29.3 million, the ONS said.  Annual wage growth excluding bonuses accelerated to 2.1
percent in the three months through May from 2 percent in the
previous quarter, compared with a retail-price inflation rate of
5 percent. Salary increases including bonuses grew 2.3 percent,
up from 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
