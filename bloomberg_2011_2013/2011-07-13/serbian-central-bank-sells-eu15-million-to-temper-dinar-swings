Serbia ’s central bank sold 15
million euros on the interbank foreign-exchange market, its
first move this month to curb dinar declines against  Europe ’s
common currency.  The National Bank of Serbia sold euros as the dinar dipped
to as low as 103.79 to the euro according to Bloomberg data. It
traded at 103.38 at 4:51 p.m. in Belgrade, 1.5 percent weaker
from yesterday’s close.  Two days of dinar declines “resulted from an increased
uncertainty due to economic problems in several euro-zone
countries,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  The National Bank of Serbia “is watching the movements in
the foreign-exchange market and is ready to eliminate excessive
daily oscillations,” it said, adding that people need to
“hedge against the foreign-exchange risk by adjusting the
currency of their income and spending.”  The  Narodna Banka Srbije  sold a total of 30 million euros
in June to curb dinar declines, triggered by the government’s
decision not to roll-over any of its euro-indexed debt that
matured on July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
