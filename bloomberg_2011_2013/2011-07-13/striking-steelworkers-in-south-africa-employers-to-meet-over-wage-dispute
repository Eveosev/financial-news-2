Striking South African steel workers
and the industry’s employer body said they will meet separately
today with their members before talks over a wage dispute
continue.  “We will be meeting today to discuss proposals among our
members,” Karl Cloete, the deputy general secretary of the
National Union of Metalworkers of  South Africa , known as  Numsa ,
said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg. Cloete said the
Steel and Engineering Industries Federation, or  SEIFSA , had
raised its offer of a 7 percent pay rise, without providing
further details.  SEIFSA yesterday denied it had increased its offer.  The employers’ federation will meet today to discuss the
strike, which began July 4, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
