Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress that a failure by Congress to raise the
nation’s $14.3 trillion debt limit would lead to a “major
crisis” and throw “shock waves” through the financial system.  Bernanke made the comment today in response to a question
raised during a House Financial Services Committee hearing.  President  Barack Obama  and Republicans in Congress are
scrambling to work out a deal to boost the legal debt limit in
return for cutting the federal government’s deficits over the
next decade. The Treasury Department has said the U.S. will
reach the limit of its borrowing authority on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
