Unipetrol AS (UNIP)  jumped the most in two
months after a European Union court overturned a 17.5 million-
euro ($24.6 million) cartel fine today for the Czech Republicâ€™s
biggest oil refiner.  The stock climbed as much as 2.3 percent, the most since
May 13, and traded up 2 percent at 176 koruna as of 11:24 a.m.
in  Prague , ending a three-day selloff. It was the best performer
in the benchmark PX stock index, which gained 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
