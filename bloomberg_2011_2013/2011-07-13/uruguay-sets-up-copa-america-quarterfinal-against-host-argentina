Uruguay defeated Mexico 1-0 to book
a quarterfinal against host  Argentina  at soccer’s Copa America,
while Chile beat Peru by the same score to win their group.  Alvaro Pereira scored in the 14th minute to give Uruguay
the victory in La Plata last night. An injury-time own goal from
Peru defender Andre Carrillo in Mendoza earlier ensured Chile of
first place in Group C with seven points.  Uruguay finished with five points and next faces archrival
Argentina, with whom it shares a record 14 titles in South
America’s continental championship, for a place in the
semifinals. Their quarterfinal is scheduled July 16 in  Santa Fe .  The other last-eight matchups will be decided today when
Paraguay plays Venezuela and Brazil takes on  Ecuador  in the
final Group B games. The top two teams and the two third-place
nations with the best records advance from the group stage.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
