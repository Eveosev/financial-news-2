The European Commission ordered
 Greece  to recover 17.4 million euros ($24.5 million) in state
aid that it says was improperly given to metallurgy company
Aluminium of Greece in 2007 and 2008. The country must also
recover interest on the money, the Brussels-based commission
said in an e-mailed statement.  The Commission also opened an in-depth probe into whether
aid provided by the Greek government to state-owned railway
company TrainOSE is in-line with European Union rules, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
