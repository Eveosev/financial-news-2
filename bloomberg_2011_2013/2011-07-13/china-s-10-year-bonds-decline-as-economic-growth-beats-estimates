China ’s 10-year bonds declined,
pushing their yield to the highest level in at least two months,
after a government report showed the economy grew at a faster
pace than economists estimated in the second quarter.  Gross domestic product advanced 9.5 percent from a year
earlier, more than the median 9.3 percent predicted in a
Bloomberg News survey, the statistics bureau said in Beijing
today. Growth was 9.7 percent in the previous three months.
Industrial output climbed 15.1 percent in June, the most since
May 2010, separate data showed.  “Traders are worried that the better-than-expected figures
will give the central bank more space to use tightening
measures,” said  Chen Qiwei , a senior bond trader at Shenzhen
Development Bank Co. in  Shanghai . “Concerns about an economic
slowdown are easing.”  The yield on the 2.77 percent notes due May 2012 rose 28
basis points to 3.68 percent as of the 4:30 p.m. close in
Shanghai, the highest level since the debt began trading on May
11, according to quotes provided by the Interbank Funding Center.  China’s finance ministry sold 30 billion yuan ($4.6 billion)
of one-year bonds at an average yield of 3.48 percent today,
according to a statement on the website of Chinabond, the
nation’s biggest debt clearing house. The rate was 10 basis
points higher than the 3.38 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 11 fixed-income analysts and traders.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, declined 105 basis points, or 1.05
percentage points, to a five-week low of 3.79 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, climbed
seven basis points to 3.81 percent, the biggest increase in a
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
