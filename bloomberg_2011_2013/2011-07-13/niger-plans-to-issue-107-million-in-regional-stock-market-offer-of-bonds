Niger plans to offer about 50
billion  CFA francs  ($107 million) of bonds on the Bourse
Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres to raise funds for
infrastructure and renovations in the capital, Niamey, said
Jean-Paul Gillet, the bourse’s head.  The notes will yield between 6.5 percent and 7 percent,
with maturities of between three years and five years, Gillet
said in an interview in Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s commercial
capital, today. It will be the first time Niger raises money
through the bourse, he said.  The rate is “unlikely to generate some international
appetite” amid concern over Niger’s balance of payments and low
levels of volume on the market, known by its acronym BRVM, said
 Samir Gadio , emerging-markets strategist with Standard Bank Plc.
“Besides, Eurozone-based investors can now buy high-yielding and
relatively liquid bonds from peripheral European countries,” he
said in an e-mailed note to clients.  The Abidjan-based market, which lists stock and debt from
eight West African countries, conducted transactions worth 30
billion CFA francs in the first half of the year, Gillet said.
It targets 100 billion CFA francs for 2011, the same as a year
earlier. Volumes are increasing “little by little,” he said.  The BRVM relocated to Bamako,  Mali , in February amid a
violent post-election stalemate that largely halted the economy
of  Ivory Coast , the world’s top cocoa producer. Trading resumed
in Abidjan in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
