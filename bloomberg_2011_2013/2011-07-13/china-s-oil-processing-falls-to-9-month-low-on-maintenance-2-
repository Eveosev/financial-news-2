China ’s daily oil-processing volume
in June fell to the lowest in nine months after refiners shut
units for maintenance.  Processing dropped 0.7 percent, the first decline since
February 2009, to 35.55 million metric tons, or 8.69 million
barrels a day, from a year earlier, according to figures
released by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
today. Daily refining, the lowest since September, slid 4
percent from a month earlier.  Refiners boosted production to a record 9.22 million
barrels a day in February to build stockpiles before halting
some of their units for maintenance. In the second half of June,
plants cut processing rates to the lowest since 2010 because of
maintenance in the northern part of the nation, Shandong-based
Oilchem.net said on July 1.  “The refinery maintenance was reflected in the lower
throughput,” Brynjar Eirik Bustnes, an analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said by telephone from  Hong Kong . “We will see
about the same amount of throughput in July with maintenance
continuing into the month.”  Diesel demand should be strong given the industrial
production growth, he said.  China will shut seven major refineries, with a combined
capacity of 35.25 million tons a year, or 707,800 barrels a day,
in the third quarter, according to Gong Manying, a market
research director at PetroChina Co., the nation’s second-largest
oil refiner.  Oil Products  Oil processing gained 7 percent to 223 million tons in the
first half.  China’s net imports of crude oil fell to an eight-month low
in June. Net imports dropped 10 percent from a month earlier and
12 percent from a year earlier to 4.7 million barrels a day,
according to customs data on July 10.  Gasoline output slipped 4.2 percent to 6.2 million tons
from a year earlier, kerosene gained 0.1 percent to 1.48 million
tons and diesel climbed 1.1 percent to 13.5 million tons,
according to the federation. Fuel oil production gained 5
percent to 1.5 million tons and natural-gas output gained 9.7
percent to 81.6 billion cubic meters.  China’s gross domestic product rose 9.5 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, beating analyst estimates of
9.3 percent, the statistics bureau said today. Industrial output
advanced 15.1 percent in June, the most since May 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
