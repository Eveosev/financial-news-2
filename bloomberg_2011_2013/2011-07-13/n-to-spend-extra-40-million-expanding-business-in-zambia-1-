MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,  Zambia ’s second-
largest mobile phone operator, said it plans to spend an extra
$40 million expanding its operations in Zambia this year.  “This will be in addition to the $220 million we have
spent” so far, said Farhad Khan, head of the company’s Zambian
unit, in an interview today in the capital, Lusaka.  The money will be spent on an improving capacity and
coverage, expansion of so-called third-generation, or 3G,
services, and its business continuity and disaster recovery
program, the company said in a separate statement.  MTN, based in Johannesburg, is expanding in Zambia and had
2.2 million subscribers in the southern African nation as of
June 30, making it the largest mobile operator after Airtel
Zambia, a unit of India’s  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)   The South African company currently has 3G equipment at
about 120, or 20 percent, of its second-generation sites in
Zambia, it said. “This will be a substantial focus for us going
forward to ensure that this number is increased, hopefully to
220-plus by end-2012,” it said.  3G enables faster data transmission and allows mobile-phone
users to download music and video to their handsets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
