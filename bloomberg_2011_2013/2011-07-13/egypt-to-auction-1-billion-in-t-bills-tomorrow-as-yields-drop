Egypt plans to seek bids for 6
billion Egyptian pounds ($1 billion) in Treasury bills tomorrow
as yields on  government securities  fell in the last two auctions
from the highest levels in more than two years.  The North African country will auction six-month notes
worth 2.5 billion pounds and one-year notes worth 3.5 billion
pounds, according to Central Bank of Egypt data on Bloomberg.
Last week, the average yield on six-month bills fell 16 basis
points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 12.632 percent and the one-
year yield dropped eight basis points to 12.9 percent from the
previous sale of bills with similar maturities.  The central bank, which holds the auctions on behalf of the
 Finance Ministry , canceled a T-bill sale on June 30 because
investors demanded yields that were too high, two government
officials with knowledge of the decision said at the time.  Egypt 
met its fund-raising target for one-year securities last week
for the first time in 12 auctions.  Egyptâ€™s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due April 2020
fell, pushing the yield up two basis points to 5.72 percent at
4:08 p.m. in Cairo. The pound retreated less than 0.1 percent
against the dollar to 5.9578.  To contact the reporter on this story:
