Scotland ’s financial services
industry will return to pre-crisis levels of employment by the
end of the year or early 2012, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said at a press conference in Edinburgh today.  The increase in jobs is being led by insurers, fund
managers and private wealth managers, as well as new entrants to
personal banking including Virgin Group Ltd. and Tesco Plc,
Salmond said.  “There is a reasonable expectation that we will get back
to pre-recession levels by around the end of this year, into
next year,” he said. “I don’t think many people would have
thought a couple of years ago that would have been possible.”  The industry employed 105,000 people in Scotland before the
financial crisis started in 2008, the leader of the ruling
 Scottish National Party  said. That fell to 91,000 in 2009 and
had recovered to 101,000 by the start of this year.  The June unemployment figures showed Scotland was creating
more jobs, had fewer people unemployed and had a lower rate of
economic inactivity than the U.K. as a whole, Salmond said. It
is the first time since January 2010 that Scotland outperformed
the U.K. on all three measures simultaneously, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
