U.S. investigators received
permission in 2009 to wiretap 104 callers to two conference
lines used by  Primary Global Research LLC , a so-called expert
networking firm, according to a court filing.  U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy in  Manhattan  signed an
order in October 2009 permitting investigators to listen in on
the lines, which included Primary Global customers, four
employees and five consultants, according the court filing
submitted yesterday by James Fleishman, a former sales manager
at the firm.  Fleishman, who is scheduled to be tried on two counts of
conspiracy next month, submitted the order and related papers in
support of his motion to block the government from introducing
evidence from the wiretaps.  Primary Global is at the center of a nationwide probe of
insider trading at  hedge funds , technology companies, banks and
consulting firms. Winifred Jiau, a former Primary Global
consultant, was convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy
June 20 in Manhattan federal court.  Ellen Davis , a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
in Manhattan, declined to comment.  The case is U.S. v. Fleishman, 11-CR-32, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
