The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.5 percent to 13,343.71, while the
Colcap Index rose 0.8 percent to 1,610.84.  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO)  ,  Colombia ’s biggest bank, rose
5.5 percent, the most since October 2008, to 29,160 pesos. The
stock bucked a six-day decline of 5.7 percent after saying it is
not acquiring any assets from ING Groep NV, said Camilo Rubiano,
chief economist at Afin SA.  “Bancolombia recovered by denying the rumors,” Rubiano
said.  Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)  , Colombia’s biggest cement
maker, rose 4.4 percent, the biggest gain in nearly four months,
to 10,980 pesos. Colombia’s grey cement production rose 14.8
percent in May from a year ago, according to the statistics
agency.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota (ETB)  SA, the
phone company serving Colombia’s capital, fell the most in 10
months after Bogota’s mayor announced a plan to avoid the sale
of the company as the city council began debating the issue.  Acting mayor Clara Lopez, of the opposition Polo
Democratico party, said she is seeking alliances with other
state-run companies in  Asia  to avoid having to sell ETB,
according to an interview with El Espectador yesterday. The
stock fell 12 percent, the most since Sept. 2, to 644 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
