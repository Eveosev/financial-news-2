Crude oil climbed after a U.S.
Energy Department report showed inventories fell more than
expected last week and as equities rallied.  Futures rose 0.6 percent after the department said supplies
dropped 3.12 million barrels to 355.5 million. Stockpiles were
forecast to fall 1.5 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg
News survey. Stocks rallied after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said he’s prepared to provide additional
stimulus if needed and on Chinese economic growth.  “The pretty good-sized drop in crude stocks, along with
the rebound in equities, provided enough firepower to turn this
market around,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisors in Houston.  Crude oil for August delivery rose 62 cents to settle at
$98.05 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Oil traded
at $97.12 before the release of the report at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington . Prices have risen 27 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for August settlement advanced $1.03, or 0.9
percent, to end the session at $118.78 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. It was the highest settlement
since June 14.  The European benchmark’s premium to U.S. futures was
$20.73, up from $20.32 at settlement yesterday and down from the
record of $22.29 on June 15.  Crude oil imports tumbled 8.7 percent to 9 million barrels
a day last week, according to the department.  Gasoline Stockpiles  Supplies of gasoline fell 840,000 barrels to 211.7 million
last week, the report showed. A 500,000-barrel gain was
projected, according to the median of 15 analyst responses in a
Bloomberg News survey. Output dropped 6.6 percent to 8.9 million
barrels a day, the least since the week ended May 6.  Gasoline for August delivery surged 5.34 cents, or 1.7
percent, to end the session at $3.1516 a gallon in  New York . It
was the highest settlement since May 10.  The Fed is ready to “provide additional policy support”
if recent economic weakness persists, Bernanke said in prepared
testimony before Congress.  “Investors really liked the DOE numbers,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc. energy advisory
company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “The report, along with the
Bernanke comments and the weaker dollar, sent the market over
$99. We were unable to break into any new territory and then
retreated from the highs.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to
1,317.72 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 0.4
percent to 12,491.61 at 4:02 p.m. in New York. The dollar
dropped 1.2 percent to $1.4141 per euro, and is heading for the
biggest decline since May 27. A weaker dollar bolsters the
appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  ‘Getting Hammered’  “The dollar is getting hammered and equities are up again,
which are providing support for oil,” said Todd Horwitz, chief
strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in New York. “The market
is still moving around in a $90-to-$100 range and I can’t see it
moving much past $100 given the present news.”  Oil in New York traded in a $10.34 range for more than four
weeks, staying between $89.61 and $99.95 since June 13.  Futures also rose after a report showed  China’s economy 
grew at a faster pace than expected in the second quarter and
the  International Energy Agency  forecast rising consumption.  Chinese Economic Strength  China’s gross domestic product and industrial output grew
9.5 percent from a year earlier, higher than the median estimate
of 9.3 percent in a Bloomberg News survey. Growth was 9.7
percent in the first three months of the year. Industrial output
climbed last month the most since May 2010.  The U.S. and China were responsible for 32 percent of
global oil demand in 2010, according to BP Plc’s Statistical
Review of World Energy released on June 8.  “The market was already primed to rise because of the good
news out of  China ,” said Sean Brodrick, a natural resource
analyst with  Weiss Research  in Jupiter,  Florida . “The Chinese
economy seems to be humming along quite nicely, which is good
for demand.”  Global oil demand growth is set to accelerate in 2012, the
IEA said, potentially adding pressure on the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost production.  Crude consumption next year will average 91 million barrels
a day, an increase of 1.5 million barrels, or 1.6 percent, from
2011, the IEA said in its monthly oil market report. That
compares with the OPEC’s forecast that world oil demand will
grow at a slower pace for a second year in 2012 as consumption
declines in Europe and slows in other industrialized nations.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 637,129
contracts as of 3:32 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 728,007
contracts yesterday, the highest level since June 23 and 6.3
percent above the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.54 million contracts, the most since June 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
