Taiwan’s dollar rebounded from the
lowest level in two weeks on speculation exporters are
repatriating earnings.  Government bonds  declined.  “The  Taiwan dollar  has weakened quite a bit in the past
two days, making it a good opportunity for exporters to sell the
greenback,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “There’s also some bargain hunting
happening in the market now.”  The Taiwan dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to NT$28.90
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.00 earlier, the
weakest level since June 28.  The yield on Taiwan’s 2 percent bonds due July 2016, the
most-traded government debt, rose one basis point to 1.16
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The
government will auction NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of five-year
securities on July 15.  Overseas investors sold $319 million more Taiwanese stocks
than they bought today, the biggest daily sell-off since June 16,
according to exchange data.  The overnight rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, was unchanged at 0.37 percent, according to a
weighted average compiled by the  Taiwan  Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
