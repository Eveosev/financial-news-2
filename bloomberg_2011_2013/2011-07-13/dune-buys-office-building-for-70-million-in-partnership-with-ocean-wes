Dune Real Estate Partners and  Ocean
West Capital Partners , two closely held property investors, paid
about $70 million for a 16-story office building in Orange
County,  California , that was under receivership.  The 307,662-square-foot (28,582-square-meter) building at
2600 Michelson Dr. in Irvine is 52 percent occupied, the
companies said in a statement today. In 2007, the peak of local
office demand, the rate was 95 percent, they said.  “We’ve seen early signs of improvement in the Orange
County office market and believe there is significant value in
its long-term fundamentals,” Russell Gimelstob of Dune said in
the statement.  Dune, based in  New York  and led by Daniel Neidich, a former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. real estate executive, has been
investing in distressed real estate assets. The company in March
agreed to buy the mortgage for Manhattan’s Mark hotel for about
$190 million, a person with knowledge of the transaction said at
the time.  The Irvine office building, previously owned by  MPG Office
Trust Inc. (MPG) , the Los Angeles-based landlord formerly known as
Maguire Properties, had been under receivership for a year and a
half, according to Troy Miller, a principal at Santa Monica,
California-based Ocean West.  To contact the reporter on this story:
