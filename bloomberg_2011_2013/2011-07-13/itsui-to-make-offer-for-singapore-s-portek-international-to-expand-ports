Mitsui & Co.,  Japan ’s most
acquisitive company, plans to offer about S$221 million ($180
million) for  Portek International Ltd. (PORT)  to expand its logistics
business in emerging economies.  The industrial, commodities and services group intends to
pay S$1.40 apiece for all Portek shares, 17 percent higher than
a June 22 offer of S$1.20 each made by  International Container
Terminal Services Inc. (ICT) , according to a statement to the
Singapore stock exchange today. Portek’s founders agreed to sell
51.3 percent of outstanding shares, Tokyo-based Mitsui said.  Buying Portek, which operates port terminals in Indonesia
and  Africa , would help the Japanese group expand its cargo
loading and unloading facilities business in emerging markets.
Mitsui, with cash and near cash items rising to an 18-year high
of 1.44 trillion yen ($18 billion) as of March 31, said it aims
to increase the port operator’s efficiency.  “For Portek, being part of a larger group is better when
you want to acquire ports in emerging countries,” said Goh Han Peng, an analyst at DMG & Partners Securities Pte in  Singapore .
“The acquisition will enable Mitsui to gain immediate access to
emerging market port operations.”  Acquisition Spree  The purchase would be Mitsui’s biggest this year outside
Japan after the 3.3 billion ringgit ($1.1 billion) buyout of
Kuala Lumpur-based hospital operator Integrated Healthcare
Holdings Ltd. completed in May. The group has spent $17.3
billion since 1999 on 200 acquisitions, the most among Japan-
based companies, according to Bloomberg data.  Portek gained 6.1 percent to close at a record of S$1.40 in
Singapore. The company’s officials weren’t immediately available
to speak when contacted by phone.  Mitsui climbed 2.1 percent to close at 1,432 yen in  Tokyo .
International Container Terminal fell 0.4 percent to 53.50 pesos
in  Manila .  International Container Terminal is studying its options
“to determine what’s best for our shareholders,” Rafael Consing, treasurer at the Manila-based company, said by phone.
An International Container Terminal unit owns 16.7 percent of
Portek, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HSBC Holdings
Plc is advising the Philippine company for the Portek offer.  Mitsui doesn’t own shares in Portek, according to a
statement by Nomura Holdings Inc., which is advising the
Japanese company on the deal.  Portek, which also makes port cranes, reported net income
of S$7.26 million in the six months ended Dec. 31, 21 percent
more than a year earlier. Sales climbed 4.4 percent to S$65.7
million. The company handled 392,000 20-foot containers in the
July-December period, 0.5 percent more than a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
