Greece  has little margin for error
in implementing the budget cuts and asset sales attached to its
110 billion-euro ($156 billion) bailout, the International
Monetary Fund’s staff said.  In an appraisal of Greece’s policies under the joint rescue
plan with the European Union, the IMF warned that exceptional
liquidity support from the  European Central Bank  is
“critical.” European policy makers need to decide how to
provide additional funding for Greece, the staff said.  “For the program to succeed, it is essential that the
authorities implement their fiscal and privatization agenda in a
timely and determined manner,” the IMF staff wrote. “The debt
dynamics show little scope for deviation.”  European finance chiefs haven’t yet agreed on how to reduce
Greece’s debt burden, floating ideas this week from bond
buybacks to a temporary default as they sought to shift a
strategy that has failed to contain the debt crisis.  Christine Lagarde , the new IMF chief, told reporters this
week that the IMF is not yet discussing details of a second
bailout package and that “nothing should be taken for
granted.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
