Marine Harvest ASA (MHG) , the world’s
largest salmon farmer, reported a 12 percent increase in second-
quarter earnings as volumes rose.  Operating profit before interest and tax climbed to about
890 million kroner ($162 million) in the period from 792 million
kroner a year earlier, the Oslo-based company said today in a
statement. Final results for the quarter are released July 20.  Harvests of “salmonid,” which include salmon, trout and
whitefish, climbed to 80,000 metric tons from 68,000 tons a year
earlier. That compares with previous guidance of 82,000 tons.  The company said in May it expects to increase volumes by
15 percent this year and reduce costs in  Norway . Global supply
of Atlantic salmon declined last year after a virus in  Chile ’s
stocks slashed production, bolstering gains in Norwegian prices.  Marine Harvest dropped 2.2 percent to 3.724 kroner at the
5:30 p.m. close in Oslo, after earlier rising as much as 5.6
percent. The shares have slumped 40 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
