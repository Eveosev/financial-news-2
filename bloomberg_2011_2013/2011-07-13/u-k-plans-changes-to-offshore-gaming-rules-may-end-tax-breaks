The U.K. government will announce
plans to change betting rules tomorrow, potentially paving the
way for an end to tax breaks available to offshore gaming
companies.  Culture minister John Penrose told Parliament this evening
that he will make a written statement at around 9.30 a.m.  London 
time giving more details of the plans. Penrose was speaking in
response to a debate called by Conservative lawmaker Matthew Hancock, former chief of staff to Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne .  “We are intending to move as fast as we can towards a
system which will fix the problem of offshore betting,” Penrose
said. “Anybody based anywhere in the world who wants to sell
gambling services to any consumer based in the U.K. will, in
future, have to have a Gambling Commission license.”  Hancock said the amount of money collected in betting duty
by the U.K. had fallen to 335 million pounds ($539 million) in
the year to March, from 424 million pounds in the year to March
2008. The government’s plans would enable the Treasury to tax
offshore bets made by U.K customers, Hancock said in an
interview afterwards.  “The government has announced it’s bringing the gambling
industry onshore,” Hancock said. “Where the person is putting
the bet on is what will matter, not where the company is
based.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
