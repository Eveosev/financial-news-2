Software AG (SOW) ,  Germany ’s second-
biggest maker of  business software , said profit in the second
quarter will be little changed compared with a year earlier
while revenue declined partly due to lower license sales.  Earnings before interest and taxes “will roughly match”
the 58.9 million euros ($84 million) reported a year earlier,
Darmstadt, Germany-based Software said in a statement today.
Sales fell to between 256 million and 258 million euros, from
267.3 million euros in the second quarter last year, it said.  “Less-favorable foreign currency translations had a
significant impact on stated revenues in comparison to the
corresponding period in 2010,” Software said. “License sales
continue to exhibit the weakness seen in first quarter 2011, and
a number of planned licensing agreements in both product lines
failed to close in June.”  Software said its EBIT ratio likely improved to between
22.5 percent and 23 percent in the second quarter, from 22
percent a year earlier. It reiterated its full-year outlook
because of a “strong” sales pipeline, forecasting sales growth
of between 5 percent and 7 percent at constant currency and an
increase in net income of between 10 percent and 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
