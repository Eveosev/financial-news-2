German aid for car-plant projects by
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  face European
Union probes amid concerns the subsidies may harm competition.  The European Commission said it needs to investigate
whether state funding for the two projects in the German state
of Saxony would violate rules restricting state aid that hurts
competition in the 27-nation EU.  Regulators will examine a proposed 46 million-euro ($65.2
million) grant to subsidize BMW’s production of two models of
electric passenger cars at its site in Leipzig. The EU said it
“could not immediately decide” whether electric cars counted
as new products that may be eligible for aid.  The EU review isn’t a surprise as the BMW plant will be
 Germany ’s first production facility for electric cars, said
 Thomas Becker , a spokesman for the Munich-based company.  The EU will also investigate an 83.7 million-euro payment
by German authorities to help pay for Volkswagen’s plans to
change vehicle production at its Zwickau plant. Regulators said
the aid may boost capacity for a market “that is undergoing
falling or at the best stagnant demand.”  Volkswagen will provide whatever information the EU asks
for as part of the “absolutely normal procedure,” said Gunter
Sandmann, a VW spokesman in Zwickau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
