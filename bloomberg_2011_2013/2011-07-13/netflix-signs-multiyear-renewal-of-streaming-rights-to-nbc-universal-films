Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the video-streaming
and DVD rental service, signed a multiyear agreement renewing
and expanding its rights to movies and television shows from  NBC
Universal .  Programming under the deal includes prior-season series,
such as “The Office,” “30 Rock” and “Parenthood,” the
companies said today in a statement. Future seasons of the shows
will be available on a one season delay basis, they said.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  The agreement follows yesterday’s decision by Netflix,
based in Los Gatos, California, to raise the price of its
combined streaming and DVD rental service by 60 percent to
$15.98 a month from $9.99 previously.  Netflix rose $7.99, or 2.7 percent, to $299.26 at 12:10

majority owner,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , advanced 21 cents to $24.83.  To contact the reporter on this story:
