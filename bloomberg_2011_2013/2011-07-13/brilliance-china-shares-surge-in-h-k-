Brilliance China Automotive Holdings
Ltd. (1114)  headed for a record close in  Hong Kong  trading after
partner  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  lifted its earnings outlook
on buoyant demand from overseas markets.  Brilliance, which assembles BMW’s 3 and 5 series sedans in
China, jumped 9.3 percent to HK$9.20 at the midday trading break
in Hong Kong, headed for the highest close since its initial
public offering in October 1999. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng
Index rose 1 percent.  Munich-based BMW raised its profit and sales forecasts
yesterday. It now anticipates sales of more than 1.6 million
vehicles this year, up from a previous forecast of deliveries in
excess of 1.5 million units. BMW’s first-half sales in  China 
rose 61 percent to 121,614 units, compared with 3.4 percent
growth for the industry.  “Luxury car sales continue to be strong, significantly
outpacing other segments,” said Steve Man, a Hong Kong-based
analyst with Samsung Securities ( Asia ) Ltd, who has a “buy”
rating on Brilliance, in a July 11 report. “We expect demand to
outstrip supply and pricing power to remain strong over the next
two to three years.”  Shenyang, China-based Brilliance aims to triple its
capacity to make BMW vehicles to 300,000 by 2013 from the end of
this year by expanding an existing site and building another 560
million euros ($789 million) plant in the northeastern city.  China’s vehicle sales jumped 32 percent last year as
government stimulus measures and economic growth of 10.3 percent
helped the nation remain the world’s largest auto market for a
second year. The nation’s luxury-car segment grew 48 percent in
the same period, according to industry consultant J.D. Power and
Associates.  Brilliance China has gained 55 percent this year, compared
with a 5.1 percent decline in the  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
