Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) , the U.K.’s
largest luxury-goods maker, reported first-quarter sales that
beat analysts’ estimates as Asian countries led growth.  Revenue in the three months ended June 30 rose 30 percent
from a year earlier to 367 million pounds ($585 million) the
London-based company said today in a statement. The average
estimate of 11 analysts compiled by the company was for revenue
of 344 million pounds.  Burberry said in May that it expects more modest growth in
profit margins this year as it accelerates store openings and
increases spending on technology. The maker of 1,695-euro
($2,400) wool capes is investing in retail, which is more
profitable than wholesale, to tap growth in mainland  China ,
where the luxury-goods market may expand by 25 percent to 11.5
billion euros in 2011, according to Bain & Co. estimates.  The fiscal year “could be a year of transition, with high
cost inflation and limited earnings momentum,” Citigroup
analysts, including  Thomas Chauvet  in  London , said today in a
report, adding that an “impressive” jump in retail sales
helped Burberry beat estimates.  Burberry gained as much as 108 pence, or 7.5 percent, to
1,545 pence, the biggest intraday jump since April 19, and was
up 4.2 percent as of 8:58 a.m. in London trading. The stock has
risen 33 percent this year, valuing the company at about 6.53
billion pounds.  ‘Modest’ Margin Growth  The luxury-goods manufacturer plans “modest improvement”
in full-year retail and wholesale operating margin and targets a
“high-teen” percentage increase for wholesale revenue in the
first half, excluding China, Burberry said.  Retail sales rose 44 percent to 245 million pounds, while
wholesale revenue increased 9 percent to 95 million pounds.
Sales jumped 62 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, 23 percent
in  Europe  and 16 percent in the Americas.  Burberry will “largely be able to mitigate” raw-material
price increases, Chief Financial Officer Stacey Cartwright said
today on a conference call. The company has no need to raise
capital and “we never said we would consider a Hong Kong
listing,” she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
