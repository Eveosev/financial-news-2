Kokusai Global Sovereign Open,
 Asia ’s biggest debt fund, is sticking with its bets on Italian
bonds even after yields on the securities climbed to the highest
level in a decade yesterday.  Italian securities make up 13.7 percent of the $30.3
billion fund’s assets, compared with 7.2 percent in the
benchmark it uses to gauge performance, the Citigroup World
Government Bond Index, according to Masataka Horii, head of the
Global Sovereign Open management team. The allocation has risen
about 0.8 percent from a year ago, the Kokusai website shows.  Italy is in better economic and fiscal shape than  Greece ,
Tokyo-based Horii wrote in an e-mail to Bloomberg News.  Greece is struggling to avoid default, leading to
speculation  Italy  will also have difficulty paying its debts.  Kokusai Global Sovereign Open has handed investors a loss
of 3.95 percent in the past three months, underperforming 83
percent of its competitors, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The price of the fund slumped 2.7 percent in the last two
days, the biggest back-to-back decline in two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
