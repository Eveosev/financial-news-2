The euro’s fate may lie in the hands
of Italian bondholders as the region’s debt crisis threatens to
envelop the Mediterranean nation, according to Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows Italy’s government debt burden,
the euro area’s largest at 1.8 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion),
dwarfs those of  Greece , Ireland and Portugal, which already
received bailouts, and Spain, which has the next-highest
borrowing costs. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is under
pressure from coalition partners to limit its contribution to
sovereign bailouts. The European Financial Stability Facility
currently has a lending capacity of 250 billion euros.  “If Italy gets to the point where its debt auctions start
to fail and it loses access to the market, it becomes difficult
to imagine who would have the kind of money that would be
required to rescue it,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of European
interest-rate strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in London. “It’s
undoubtedly bigger than the current scope of the EFSF.”  European Central Bank incoming President  Mario Draghi  said
yesterday that the euro-area’s debt crisis has “entered a new
phase” and policy makers must come up with a “clear” response
to stop the contagion that threatens the survival of the
region’s single currency.  Italian 10-year bond yields surged above 6 percent on July
12 for the first time since 1997 after Moody’s Investors Service
and  Standard & Poor’s  said the nation may be unable to trim its
debt burden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
