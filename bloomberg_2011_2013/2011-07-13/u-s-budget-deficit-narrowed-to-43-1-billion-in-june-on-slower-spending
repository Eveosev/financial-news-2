The U.S. posted a monthly  budget
deficit  of $43.1 billion in June, smaller than a year earlier
and reflecting a decline in spending.  In June 2010, the shortfall was $68.4 billion, according to
the Treasury Department’s monthly budget statement, released
today in  Washington .  A slowing economy and restrained job growth may limit tax
receipts for the government, raising the risk that the budget
deficit will reach a record this fiscal year. The shortfall
underscores the urgency surrounding budget negotiations between
President Barack Obama and Congress as the U.S. approaches a
$14.3 trillion statutory debt limit.  “We need stronger economic growth to bring the deficit
down or some restraint on spending,” said  Gary Thayer , chief
macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors LLC in  St. Louis .
“Unfortunately, we’re in a soft spot on the economy. We really
don’t have a robust recovery.”  The median projection in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists called for a $45.4 billion gap in June. Estimates in
the survey of 30 economists ranged from $30 billion to $75
billion.  For the fiscal year to date, the budget deficit was $970.5
billion compared with $1 trillion the prior fiscal year to date,
according to the Treasury’s monthly budget statement.  In June, revenue and other fees decreased 0.6 percent to
$249.7 billion, according to the Treasury’s statistics.  Tax Receipts  Individual income tax receipts so far this fiscal year rose
24.3 percent to $814.9 billion. Corporate income tax receipts
rose 1 percent to $134.3 billion.  Spending by the government fell 8.4 percent in June from
the same month last year to $292.7 billion.  The  Congressional Budget Office  projected a monthly
shortfall of $45 billion for June.  “Two adjustments to the estimated subsidy cost of loans
and loan guarantees made in previous years reduced outlays by
roughly $21 billion this June,” the CBO said in a budget
estimate released July 11.  The fiscal 2011 budget shortfall may match a record of $1.4
trillion, according to the CBO. In fiscal year 2010, the annual
budget deficit was $1.3 trillion after a $1.4 trillion in fiscal
2009.  “There is no plan to bring deficit spending back under $1
trillion per year following the recession let alone tackling the
Baby Boomers’ demands for health and retirement care over the
next few decades,” said  Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  New York . “If Congress
does not act soon, the Treasury yields can go only one direction
and that is straight up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
