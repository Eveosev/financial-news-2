The U.K. government should
reconsider plans not to provide a main hub at  London ’s Heathrow
airport for the proposed High Speed 2 rail network, the
 London Chamber of Commerce and Indus try said.  The proposed link at Old Oak Common station in west London
doesn’t have the “connectivity and economic benefits of a
direct link to the airport, nor does it take advantage of the
infrastructure and national and international connections
already in place” at the airport, the industry body said in an
e-mailed statement.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition government
abandoned plans to have the main hub for HS2 at Heathrow rather
than at Euston station in the city center. Under the plan,
similar to that proposed by the previous Labour government, the
track will run from London to Birmingham in central  England  and
then split in two to reach Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
