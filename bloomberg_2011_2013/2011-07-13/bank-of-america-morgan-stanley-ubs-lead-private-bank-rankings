Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  still heads a
ranking of the world’s 20 biggest wealth managers while  BNP
Paribas (BNP)  SA climbed two positions to ninth place, according to
 Scorpio Partnership .  Morgan Stanley (MS)  was second, followed by Zurich-based  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
which was one of five Swiss private banks in the top 20, London-
based Scorpio said in a survey of almost 200 institutions
published today.  Market gains helped boost assets managed by these banks by
11 percent last year with the top 20 overseeing a combined $11.1
trillion, Scorpio said. The rate of net new money inflows
declined on average by almost 19 percent from 2009 and many
banks saw margins squeezed, according to Scorpio.  “If there were to be another market crisis of even a minor
scale, we would be very concerned for many institutions and
their future,” said Sebastian Dovey, a partner at Scorpio.
“Many firms need to upgrade and modernize or else call time on
their exposure to this client segment.”  The industry’s average cost-to-income ratio worsened by
almost 1 percentage point to 79.76 percent last year as expenses
increased, especially among smaller wealth managers, the survey
showed.  Following is a table of the world’s biggest wealth
managers, based on end-2010 data from the Scorpio survey.
Scorpio restated some 2009 figures in line with adjusted data
provided by banks including UBS and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
