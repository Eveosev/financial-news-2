British Open organizers may move
some tee positions forward because of high winds forecast for
tomorrow’s opening round.  Gusts of up to 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour are
forecast for Royal St. George’s in Sandwich,  England , according
to the U.K.’s Met Office. That may prevent golfers from reaching
some fairways and long par-3 holes.  “We do have some wind issues out there which may,
dependent on wind direction, make some of the very back tees
difficult to reach fairways from,” Peter Dawson, chief
executive officer of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of  St.
Andrews , said in a news conference. “So we have told the
players that we may move some tees up, depending on wind
conditions.”  The par-5, 564-yard seventh hole and the par-3, 243-yard
11th hole may be candidates to have tees moved, Dawson
said. Tee shots on No. 7 must carry about 220 yards to the
fairway, while  Phil Mickelson  said yesterday he came up short
at the 11th with his driver in practice.  Dawson said players were invited to practice off forward
tees the past three days.  “Now if the wind turns around, it’s a completely different
story,” he said. “But I think players should be able to reach
the fairway and reach the par-3s, frankly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
