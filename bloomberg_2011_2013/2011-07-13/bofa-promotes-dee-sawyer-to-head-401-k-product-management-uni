Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. bank by assets, promoted Dee Sawyer to head a unit managing
401(k) offerings in its retirement-services division.  Sawyer joined Bank of America in October as a director of
strategy and business development in the  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based lender’s Merrill Lynch retirement business,
according to a memo from Stephen Ulian, head of institutional
retirement solutions. Sawyer, who previously spent 15 years at
 Fidelity Investments , will assume her new role on Aug. 8, Ulian
said today in the memo to employees of the division.  “This appointment comes at a critical time, as
corporations increasingly turn to 401(k)s as one of the, if not
the, primary retirement benefit plans they offer to their
employees,” Ulian said in the memo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
