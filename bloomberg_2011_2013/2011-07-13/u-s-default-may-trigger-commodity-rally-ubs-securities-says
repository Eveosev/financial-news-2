If the U.S. government can’t reach
an agreement on raising the debt ceiling, investors may buy
physical assets such as raw materials and “rush away from
financial assets,” said John Kowalik, an executive director of
commodity structuring and marketing at UBS Securities LLC.  A default on debt would cause “broad-based allocation in
commodities and perhaps precious metals even more so,” Kowalik
said today in a speech in  Chicago .  To contact the reporters on this story:
