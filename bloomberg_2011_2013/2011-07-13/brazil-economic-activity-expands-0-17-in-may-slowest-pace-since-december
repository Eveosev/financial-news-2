Brazil ’s economy expanded in May at
the slowest pace this year and by less than economists expected.  Economic activity, a proxy for gross domestic product, rose
0.17 percent in May from the previous month, according to the
central bank’s seasonally adjusted index, from 0.44 percent in
April. The expansion was slower than the 0.4 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts and was the
slowest since a 0.06 percent rise in December.  Activity was up 4.25 percent from the same month a year
ago.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini has tried to slow
 Latin America ’s biggest economy by raising the benchmark Selic
rate at all four of the bank’s policy meetings this year, to
12.25 percent. Traders are betting on two further quarter-point
increases this month and in August, according to Bloomberg
estimates based on interest rate futures.  Since April, inflation has exceeded the 6.5 percent upper
limit of the bank’s target range. Consumer prices rose 6.71
percent in June from a year earlier, the fastest pace in six
years. Tombini told a Senate hearing last week that he expects
inflation to peak in August.  The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points. Tombini has repeatedly said that
the central bank aims to slow inflation to the mid-point of the
target by 2012.  Retail Recovery  Recent indicators show that the central bank may have more
work to do to cool the economy. Retail sales recovered in May
following an unexpected fall the previous month. Industrial
capacity utilization was 82.40 percent in May, the same level it
was in December before the central bank began raising rates.
 Consumer confidence  rose in June from May.  Analysts expect growth to slow to 3.94 percent this year,
according to the median forecast in a July 8 central bank
survey. Last year, the economy expanded 7.5 percent, its fastest
pace in more than two decades. Brazil’s economy will grow slower
than those of Russia, India and  China , the other so-called BRIC
countries, between 2011 and 2014, according to forecasts from
the  International Monetary Fund .  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.70 percent at 11:37 a.m.
