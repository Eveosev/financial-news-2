Turkey ’s government is bracing for a
possible second global economic decline caused by European debt
problems, Deputy Prime Minister  Ali Babacan  said.  “The risk in  Europe  is growing,” he told reporters in
Ankara today. “There’s a risk of a difficult period like
2009.”  Turkish gross domestic product fell 4.8 percent that year
in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. Ireland’s credit rating was cut to junk by Moody’s
Investors Service yesterday after European finance ministers
failed to reach a decision on how to stem the Greek crisis.  Turkey’s priority is to maintain fiscal discipline and
prepare changes to the labor market that will make companies
more productive and help reduce the current-account deficit,
Babacan said.  “It’ll take some time for the structural reforms to start
producing results, so if we have to live with a current-account
gap, what matters now is that it’s sustainable,” he said.  The current-account shortfall in May more than doubled to
$7.8 billion, bringing the 12-month cumulative total deficit to
$68.2 billion, equivalent to about 9 percent of the government’s
estimate for gross domestic product in 2011. The gap is the
biggest risk to financial stability in the $740 billion economy,
according to a central bank report in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
