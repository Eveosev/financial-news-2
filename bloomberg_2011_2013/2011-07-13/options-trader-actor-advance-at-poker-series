Options trader Jeremy Wien and actor
Jason Alexander are among those remaining after two rounds of
the  World Series  of Poker’s main event.  Wien, head of VIX options trading at  Peak6 Capital
Management LLC  in  Chicago , and Alexander, known for his role as
George Costanza on the television show “ Seinfeld ,” are among
1,866 players alive out of 6,685 who entered the $10,000 buy-in
Tournament in Las Vegas, according to its website.  With the average remaining stack of chips at 110,370 for
the tournament officially known as the No-Limit Hold’em World
Championship, Alexander is 349th with 167,000 and Wien is 695th
with 117,000. The champion will receive $8.7 million and 693
people will finish in the money.  “It’s a grind, and early on especially it’s about
survival,” Wien said in a telephone interview. “You have to
build up some chips when you can. You can’t just play no hands
and fold your way to Day 3 because that doesn’t accomplish
anything and it may not even work.”  With Day 2 split into two groups, Wien survived his Day 2
session two days ago. It’s his fifth year playing the main event
and the third straight year he’s made it to round 3. After early
eliminations in his first two tries, Wien finished 282nd in
2009.  “Experience matters in this tournament more than others,”
Wien said. “There are definitely poker players who are better
than me who haven’t played this tournament as much as I have or
figured it out as much as I have.”  Lamb Leads  Ben Lamb of Tulsa,  Oklahoma , who already has won a
tournament at the 58-event World Series of Poker in  Las Vegas ,
is the main event’s chip leader, with 551,600.  Former main-event champions eliminated in the Day 2 session
that began yesterday were Jamie Gold and Joe Hachem, as were
poker professionals Mike Matusow, Barry Greenstein, Mike Sexton
and Brandon Adams.  Top pros advancing included Patrik Antonius, Erick
Lindgren, Todd Brunson and Jeffrey Lisandro, as well as actor
Brad Garrett, who has 46,000 in chips.  David Einhorn , the head of Greenlight Capital Inc., who
agreed in May to buy 33 percent of the  New York Mets , was
eliminated during Day 2. Einhorn finished 18th in the 2006 main
event.  The remaining competitors will now play at the same time
during round 3, which begins tomorrow. The tournament, held at
the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino, is schedule to play down to
nine by July 19. Those players will compete at the final table
on Nov. 7 to crown the champion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
