OAO Sberbank advanced for a second
day after  Russia â€™s largest lender said first-half profit almost
tripled as the bank recovered reserves set aside earlier for bad
loans.  The shares rose 1.4 percent to 103.94 rubles at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest jump since July 7.  Net income under Russian accounting standards increased to
171 billion rubles ($6 billion) from 60.7 billion rubles a year
earlier, the Moscow-based lender said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
