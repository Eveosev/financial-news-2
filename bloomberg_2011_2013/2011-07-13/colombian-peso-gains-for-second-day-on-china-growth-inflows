Colombia ’s peso rose for a second
day as stronger-than-forecast Chinese growth led to renewed
appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 1,757.85 per dollar at
10:32 a.m. New York time, from 1,764 yesterday. The peso has
risen 3.5 percent in the past three months, the best performance
among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The external environment is helping gains in Latin
American currencies today,” said  David Aldana , an analyst at
brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA in Bogota. “The strengthening
trend in the peso should continue this third quarter, given the
strong flows coming from both foreign direct investment and
portfolio investment.”  China’s economy  grew 9.5 percent in the second quarter from
a year earlier, the statistics bureau in Beijing said, after a
9.7 percent gain in the first quarter. That beat the median 9.3
percent estimate among 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.78 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.179
centavo to 117.773 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
