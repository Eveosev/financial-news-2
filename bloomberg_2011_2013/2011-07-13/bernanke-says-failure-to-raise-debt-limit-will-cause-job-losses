Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economy may be thrown into reverse and
employers would start cutting jobs if Congress fails to raise
the nation’s legal borrowing authority.  The Fed chief said today it was “conceivable” that the
economy could shrink for two straight quarters, a rough rule of
thumb for a recession. Bernanke also said he was “quite
certain” that the economy would lose jobs. He didn’t say how
many jobs could be lost.  Bernanke made his comments today at a House Financial
Services Committee hearing. Congress and President Barack Obama
face an Aug. 2 deadline for boosting the nation’s $14.3 trillion
debt ceiling, or risk that the federal government would default
on its bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
