JA Solar Holdings Co. Chief
Financial Officer Anthea Chung resigned after shares of the
Chinese manufacturer of solar cells dropped to a one-year low.  The falling share price drove down her compensation, said
Dan Ries, an analyst at Collins Stewart LLC in  New York .  “She was getting paid largely in stock options and they’re
probably worthless at this point,” Ries said today in an
interview. “I totally understand why she would want to leave.
There’s no whiff of fraud here.” He has a “neutral” rating on
the stock and a $4.50 price target.  Chung will be replaced by Min Cao, a vice president at
Jinglong Group, a company controlled by JA Solar Chairman Jin
Baofang, the company said today in a statement. Chung will
continue working with management through Aug. 19.  JA Solar rose 26 cents, or 5.7 percent, to $4.82 at 9:48 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading after closing yesterday at their
lowest price since June 29, 2010. The shares have declined 31
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
