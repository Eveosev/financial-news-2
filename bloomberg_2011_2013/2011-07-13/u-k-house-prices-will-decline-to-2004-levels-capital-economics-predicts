U.K. house prices will decline to
levels seen in 2004 as the economic recovery struggles to gain
traction and consumers limit spending,  Capital Economics  Ltd.
said in a report today.  Prices will fall 5 percent this year, 7 percent in 2012 and
may decline another 5 percent in 2013, economists including
 Roger Bootle  at the London-based researcher said in an e-mailed
note today. The group also cut its forecast for growth in gross
domestic product this year to 1 percent from 1.5 percent.  A rebound in house prices has faltered as the biggest
public-spending squeeze since World War II and soaring inflation
undermines confidence. The  Bank of England  left its key interest
rate at a record low of 0.5 percent this month to support
economic growth.  “Our views on valuation, as well as our expectations for
the economy and housing-market activity levels, mean that we
anticipate further falls in  house prices ,” the report said.
“But the fact that interest rates are likely to be kept on hold
may mean that the pace of adjustment is relatively slow.”  The ratio of house prices to earnings in the U.K. is at
5.1, “well above” the longer-term average of 3.7, Capital
said. Other measures of value, such as the ratio of house prices
to rents or to equity prices, suggest the market is 15 percent
to 20 percent overvalued.  Britons’ demand for mortgages is also fading as
unemployment rises, adding to pressure on the residential
 property market , according to the report. The  Office for
National Statistics  said today the number of people claiming
jobless benefits rose 24,500 to 1.52 million in June, the
highest level since March 2010.  Recent reports on house prices have been mixed.  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s Halifax division said July 6 that prices
rose 1.2 percent in June from the previous month to an average
163,049 ($263,000) pounds amid a shortage of homes available for
sale. A Nationwide Building Society index showed prices were
little changed last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
