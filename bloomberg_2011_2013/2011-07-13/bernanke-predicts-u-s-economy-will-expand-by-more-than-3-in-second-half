Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he expects the economy to grow at an annual pace
exceeding 3 percent in the second half of this year.  Bernanke said an expansion of “3 percent plus” is based
on stronger auto sales and production and more spending by
consumers.  In the first half of this year, auto production was hobbled
by a shortage of parts because of the Japan earthquake, and high
gasoline prices weighed on  consumer spending , he said today in
response to a question at a House Financial Services Committee
hearing. He estimated growth during that period was around a 2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
