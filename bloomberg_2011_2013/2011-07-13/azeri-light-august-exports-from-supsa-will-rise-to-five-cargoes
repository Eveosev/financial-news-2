Exports of Azeri Light crude from
 Georgia â€™s Black Sea port of Supsa will increase to five cargoes
in August from one this month, according to a loading schedule
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The August program comprises five shipments totaling 3
million barrels, or 96,774 barrels a day, the plan shows.  Crude exports from Supsa were suspended because of a
production halt at the Chirag-1 platform on July 10, said Tamam
Bayatli, a  BP Plc (BP/)  spokeswoman based in the capital Baku.  Oil from the platform is transported via the Baku-Supsa
pipeline, which carries Azeri Light grade from the Caspian Sea
to the Black Sea.  BP is the operator of Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field. The
State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , known as Socar, as well as Chevron
Corp., Statoil ASA and Exxon Mobil Corp. own stakes in the
project. BP also runs the pipeline.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
