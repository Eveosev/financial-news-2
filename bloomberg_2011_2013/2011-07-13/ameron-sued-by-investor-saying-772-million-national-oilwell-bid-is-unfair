Ameron International Corp. (AMN)  was sued
by an investor claiming a $772 million buyout offer from
oilfield-equipment provider  National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV) 
undervalues the stock.  Directors of  Pasadena , California-based Ameron, which makes
pipe systems, have a duty to get the best price, plaintiff Alan
Kahn said in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint made public
today in Wilmington. National Oilwell bid $85 a share. Analysts
have suggested they may be worth more than $100 each, Kahn said.  Ameron directors “have failed to take adequate measures”
to protect shareholders’ investments and “embarked on a process
that avoided competitive bidding,” Kahn said.  National Oilwell, based in Houston, said July 5 it would
buy Ameron to gain access to its fiberglass-pipe business.  Gary Wagner, chief financial officer for Ameron, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Ameron fell 1 cent to $85.30 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at 12:02 p.m.  The case is Kahn v. Ameron, CA6660, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
