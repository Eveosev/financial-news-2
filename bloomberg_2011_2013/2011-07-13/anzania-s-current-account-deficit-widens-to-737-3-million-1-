Tanzania’s current account deficit
widened to $737.3 million in the three months through March from
$318 million in the previous quarter, the central bank said.  The shortfall increased after development partners
“frontload most of their pledges in the first two quarters of
the fiscal year,” the Bank of Tanzania said in an e-mailed
report today.  Exports of goods slid to $1 billion in the three months to
March 31 from $1.1 billion in the previous three month,
according to the report. Gold shipments rose to $443.8 million
from $409.6 million over the same period, while imports declined
to $1.91 billion from $1.97 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
