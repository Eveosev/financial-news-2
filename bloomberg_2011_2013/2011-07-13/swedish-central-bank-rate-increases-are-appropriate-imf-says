The Swedish Riksbank’s plans to
continue raising  interest rates  are appropriate given the Nordic
economy’s “impressive” recovery from the global crisis, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  The bank should remain “flexible” and be ready to slow
the pace of tightening should the “strong krona appreciation
continue,” the Washington-based fund said today in a staff
report. Policy makers should also be prepared to pick up the
pace of increases if wage growth accelerates, the IMF said.  The largest Nordic economy will expand 4.4 percent this
year after growing 5.5 percent in 2010, the fund estimates. The
main risks to a continued recovery are youth and long-term
unemployment, while  Sweden ’s fixed investment continues to hover
below pre-crisis levels, the IMF said.  At the same time, Sweden may face a “decline in house
prices in coming years, which could have an adverse impact on
growth,” the fund said. “Despite the recent dip in  house
prices , they still appear richly valued in the context of
elevated household indebtedness.”  Should the government decide there is scope for tax cuts
next year, “the focus should be on the earned income tax credit
to strengthen labor market performance,” the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
