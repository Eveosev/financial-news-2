President  Barack Obama  “abruptly”
walked out of today’s White House meeting with legislative
leaders on the federal deficit, House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor  told reporters.  Cantor said he told Obama “we are far apart” on proposals
to cut the deficit and raise the U.S. debt limit.  The president “got very agitated” and said, “Don’t call my
bluff; I am going to the American people,” said Cantor, a
Virginia Republican. Obama “shoved back from the table” and
left, Cantor said.  “We’re so far apart and going back on the momentum,” Cantor
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
