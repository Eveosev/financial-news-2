Turkish soccer teams under
investigation over alleged match-fixing can compete in European
tournaments pending the results of the probe.  The clubs that qualified for UEFA’s  Champions League  and
Europa League provided written guarantees that they haven’t been
involved in rigging games, the European soccer body said
yesterday in a statement on its  website .  Turkish authorities are providing information to UEFA, and
the special prosecutor Mehmet Berk’s investigation hasn’t
produced anything that would bar five teams including league
champion Fenerbahce and cup winner Besiktas from competing in
the new season, according to the statement.  Istanbul police said last week that they have evidence of
attempts to illegally influence the outcome of 19 matches as the
probe widened with the number of coaches, footballers,
executives and officials that are in detention exceeding 50
people.  “A decision to exclude a club from a competition, or from
any future European competitions for a number of years, can be
made at any time if it transpires that the club in question
obtained qualification via manipulated or fixed matches,”  UEFA 
said. The association said it’s monitoring developments
“daily.”  The Turkish Football Federation has until July 15 to submit
the list of teams that will compete in  Europe  to UEFA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
