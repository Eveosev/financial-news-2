South Korea  may spend 2.2 trillion
won ($2 billion) to build a research center, schools and parks
in the nation’s main nuclear-energy hub, aiming to improve
public sentiment following the Japan atomic disaster.  The government of  Gyeongsangbukdo  province, where half of
the nation’s 21 reactors are based, asked the Presidential
Office and other central government agencies to conduct a
feasibility study of the project, said Kim Sung Ryeol, a
provincial government official involved in the planning of the
project. The complex would be completed by 2028, he said.  “We’re seeking the central government’s support as it’s a
nuclear issue, which has nationwide interest,” Kim said. The
result of the feasibility study may be available by the end of
this year.  The proposed complex may also house a hospital, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
