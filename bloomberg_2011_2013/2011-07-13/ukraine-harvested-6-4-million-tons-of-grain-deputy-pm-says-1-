Ukraine harvested more than 6.4
million metric tons of grains so far, First Deputy Prime
Minister Andriy Klyuev said.  The crop was harvested from 2 million hectares (4.9 million
acres), Klyuev told a government meeting today in the capital,
Kiev. Average grain yields increased to 2.8 tons a hectare so
far this year compared with 2.4 tons a year earlier, he said.
Harvesting began in late June.  Exports in the marketing year that began July 1 may reach
20 million tons, including 9 million tons of wheat, Klyuev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
