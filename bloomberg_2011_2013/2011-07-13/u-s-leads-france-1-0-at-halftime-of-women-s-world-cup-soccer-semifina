The U.S. was leading  France  1-0 at
halftime of their Women’s World Cup semifinal after a ninth-
minute goal by forward Lauren Cheney.  She opened the scoring in Moenchengladbach,  Germany  by
directing in a cross from Heather O’Reilly.  France controlled the midfield for much of the half, but
could only hit 3 long shots, while the U.S. scored on its only
shot on goal. French defender Sonia Bompastor hit the crossbar
in the 33rd minute, while six minutes later Abby Wambach of the
U.S. couldn’t head home after beating the goalkeeper.  The winner will play the victor of today’s semifinal in
Frankfurt between Japan and Sweden in the July 17 final. The
Americans have beaten France in 11 of the 13 times they’ve
played.  The U.S. is trying to win its third Women’s  World Cup  after
getting the trophy in 1991 and 1999. The team finished third in
1995, 2003, and 2007.  The U.S. defeated  Brazil  in a penalty shootout to reach the
semifinal. The Americans won the shootout 5-3 after the match
finished 2-2 after extra time.  France is in its second Women’s World Cup, after playing in
the 2003 event in the U.S. The French won 11 of their 12
qualifying matches for this year’s tournament, and outscored its
competitors, 53-2. The team beat  England  in the quarterfinal in
a shootout 4-3 after the game finished 1-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
