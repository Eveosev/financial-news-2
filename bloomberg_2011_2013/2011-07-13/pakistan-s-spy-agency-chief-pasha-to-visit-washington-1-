The chief of Pakistan’s military
intelligence agency, Ahmed Shujaa Pasha, will leave for
Washington today, the official  Associated Press  of Pakistan
reported, citing a military statement.  Pasha’s trip to the U.S. is his first since the killing of
 Osama bin Laden  in the Pakistani army garrison town of
Abbottabad on May 2. The unilateral raid by U.S. troops has
strained ties between two allies fighting Taliban militants
along Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan.  While in Washington, Pasha will meet with acting CIA
Director Michael Morrell, according to a U.S. government
official familiar with the visit, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because he was not authorized to announce the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
