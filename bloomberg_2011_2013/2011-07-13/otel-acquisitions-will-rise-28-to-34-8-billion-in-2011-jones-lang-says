Purchases of hotels probably will
rise 28 percent to $34.8 billion worldwide this year as climbing
occupancies lure investors to the properties, Jones Lang LaSalle
Hotels said today.  Lodging transactions increased to $14.8 billion in the
first half of 2011, up 117 percent from a year earlier, the
London-based company said in a statement. In the Americas,
acquisitions totaled $7.4 billion, up 187 percent, driven by
deals in such large cities as  New York .  Real estate investment trusts “continued as the most
acquisitive buyers in the Americas although private equity
investors, who were on the sidelines during the downturn, made a
strong comeback to the market in the first half of 2011,”
Arthur Adler, chief executive officer for the Americas at Jones
Lang, said in the statement.  Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB) , the owner of the  W Hotel  in Boston
and the Mondrian  Los Angeles , agreed in June to buy a stake in
six boutique hotels in New York for $152 million.  DiamondRock
Hospitality Co. (DRH) , a REIT with hotels operated by Marriott
International Inc., in May agreed to buy Manhattan’s 712-room
Radisson Lexington Hotel New York for $335 million.  Hotel occupancies in the top 25 U.S. markets climbed to 65
percent this year through May from 62 percent a year earlier,
according to  Smith Travel Research Inc.  of Hendersonville,
Tennessee.  Sales of lodging properties in the Americas probably will
total $16 billion in 2011, up from Jones Lang’s previous
forecast of $13.1 billion, the company said. Its forecasts are
for property transactions and exclude recapitalizations, debt
purchases and foreclosures.  The company’s parent is Chicago-based  Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc. (JLL) , the largest publicly traded commercial property brokerage
after Los Angeles-based CB Richard Ellis Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
