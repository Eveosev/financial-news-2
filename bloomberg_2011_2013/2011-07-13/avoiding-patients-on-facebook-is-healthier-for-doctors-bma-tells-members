Social-networking services such as
Facebook Inc. pose risks for doctors, who should “politely
refuse” friend requests from patients and be wary of posting on
Twitter, the British Medical Association said.  Health professionals and medical students should also adopt
strict privacy settings on the websites, where unchecked candor
may damage patient confidentiality and hurt a doctor’s job
prospects, the London-based  BMA , which represents about 140,000
U.K. physicians and medical students, said in guidelines issued
today. Online social networks can “blur the boundary” between
a doctor’s professional and private lives, the group said.  “Writing something on a social networking site is anything
but a confidential or private medium,” said Tony Calland,
chairman of the medical group’s ethics committee, who uses the
“most strict” privacy settings for his  Facebook  account, in an
interview. “You just have to ensure that there’s a proper
separation between professional life and social life.”  A group of doctors and nurses in 2009 took pictures of
themselves lying facedown in places such as hospital trolleys,
ward floors and an ambulance helipad as part of a game called
planking. They were suspended after posting the photos on
Facebook, according to  reports  in U.K. newspapers.  About 60 percent of 78 U.S. medical schools surveyed that
same year reported incidents of students posting unprofessional
online content, such as profanity, according to an  article
published  in the Journal of the  American Medical Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
