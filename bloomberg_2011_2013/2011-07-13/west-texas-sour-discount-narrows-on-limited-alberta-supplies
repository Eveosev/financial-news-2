West Texas Sour crude’s discount
narrowed to the smallest in more than a year as Midcontinent
refiners substituted the grade to make up for limited shipments
of Western Canada Select.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  curtailed July crude shipments on its
Keystone pipeline by 19 percent, according to a bulletin sent to
shippers June 20 that was obtained by Bloomberg News. Spot and
makeup volume nominations on the 591,000-barrel-a-day pipeline
system will to be reduced to zero, according to the bulletin.  “If Canadian supplies are limited into the Midcontinent,
then overall that increases demand for oil that is remaining,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston. Asphalt demand is also boosting the price of West Texas
Sour, he said.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to 85 cents a
barrel below West Texas Intermediate as of 4:14 p.m. in  New
York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
smallest discount for the grade since May 25, 2010.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$18.75 a barrel. The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $9.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium was unchanged at $18 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added $1.15 to $20.40 a barrel
over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened 15 cents to $13.75 a barrel, while Poseidon’s
premium gained 85 cents to $14.10.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium added 25 cents to $12.25 a
barrel over WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium lost 25 cents to
$18.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
