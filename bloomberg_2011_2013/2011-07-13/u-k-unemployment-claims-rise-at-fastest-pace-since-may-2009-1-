U.K. unemployment claims rose at
their fastest pace since May 2009 last month, casting doubt on
whether the economy is generating enough jobs to offset the
deepest government budget cuts since World War II.  Jobless benefit claims rose by 24,500 from May to 1.52
million, the highest level since March 2010, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today in London. The median forecast of
21 economists in a Bloomberg News Survey was for a gain of
15,000. Unemployment measured by International Labour
Organization methods fell by 26,000 to 2.45 million people in
the quarter through May.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  is counting on private
companies to keep creating jobs as his government eliminates
more than 300,000 public-sector posts to tackle the  budget
deficit . Today’s figures may provide ammunition for opposition
politicians who say the pace of cuts is undermining the
recovery.  “I’ve got unemployment to rise until the middle of next
year, but not massively,” said  Ross Walker , chief U.K.
economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London . “The
risks to growth are still to the downside and the  Bank of
England  has migrated to a more dovish stance. What these numbers
caution against is any knee-jerk reaction in policy.”  No Compromise  The pound pared gains against the dollar and was trading at
$1.5963 as of 1 p.m. in London, up 0.3 percent on the day.  The claimant-count rate was unchanged at 4.7 percent in
June. Part of the increase in jobless claims was due to rule
changes affecting women as recipients of lone-parent benefits
were moved onto the jobless roll, the statistics office said.  Cameron’s refusal to compromise on the pace of deficit-
cutting is testing the economic recovery as high inflation
erodes household incomes at the fastest pace since the 1970s.  The economy probably grew just 0.1 percent in the second
quarter, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research
said last week. Bombardier, the world’s biggest trainmaker, said
this month it will eliminate more than 1,400 jobs at a U.K.
after it lost a government contract. Meanwhile, chocolate
retailer Thorntons Plc and  Carpetright Plc (CPR)  plan to close stores
in response to a slump in  consumer spending .  Youth Unemployment  Based on ILO methods, the  unemployment rate  slipped to 7.7
percent in the three months through May from 7.8 percent in the
period through February. That compares with 9.9 percent in the
euro region, 9.2 percent in the U.S. and 4.5 percent in  Japan ,
the statistics office said.  The drop in ILO unemployment reflected a 42,000 decline in
joblessness among people aged 16 to 24 as they left the  labor
force  to join full-time education, the statistics office said.
In the latest month covered, ILO unemployment climbed by 22,000.  Claimant unemployment rose 22,500 in May rather than the
19,600 previously reported, the statistics office said.  Employment between March and May rose 50,000, taking the
total of people in work to 29.3 million, the ONS said.  Still, the number of people working part time because they
could not find a full-time job rose to a record high, economic
inactivity rose by 32,000 to 9.3 million and job vacancies
dropped by 38,000.  “The Tories are creating a vicious circle in our economy
because they are cutting too far and too fast -- hitting
families and costing jobs,”  Liam Byrne , who speaks on work and
pensions for the opposition  Labour Party , said in a statement.
“More people out of work and on benefits makes it harder to get
the deficit down.”  Annual wage growth excluding bonuses accelerated to 2.1
percent in the three months through May from 2 percent in the
previous quarter, compared with a retail-price inflation rate of
5 percent. Salary increases including bonuses grew 2.3 percent,
up from 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
