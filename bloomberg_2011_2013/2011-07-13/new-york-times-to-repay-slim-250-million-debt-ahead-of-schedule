New York Times Co. (NYT) , publisher of the
namesake newspaper, is repaying the $250 million loan granted by
billionaire  Carlos Slim  earlier than planned, a sign the company
has stabilized after contending with flagging advertising sales.  The repayment of the two-year-old loan, which will total
$279 million including unpaid interest and a prepayment premium,
will take place on Aug. 15, five months in advance, according to
a statement. Times Co. will record a $46 million loss in the
third quarter because of the payment.  Times Co., which took the loan in 2009 as ad sales at its
flagship newspaper slumped, has since expanded its digital
business to help spur growth. It started a paid online
subscription model this year and is preparing to introduce a
similar model at the Boston Globe later in 2011.  “It has been a very good operation for us and for them,”
 Arturo Elias , Slim’s chief spokesman and son-in-law, said today
in a telephone interview. “It was done in a difficult moment
for the company, and they have done a good job and so are able
to prepay.”  Time Co.’s advertising sales dropped 2.7 percent last year
to $1.3 billion, slowing from a 24.5 percent decline in 2008.  The company’s stock rose 11 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $8.89
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have dropped 9.3 percent this year.  Long-Term Debt  Times Co. borrowed $250 million from Slim’s Banco Inbursa
SA and Inmobiliaria Carso SA in 2009, buying time to sell assets
and refinance existing debt. The lenders received six-year notes
with a coupon of more than 14 percent and detachable warrants.
The warrants to acquire 15.9 million shares at $6.3572 apiece
expire in January 2015.  Times Co. reported a total of $998.5 million in long-term
borrowings at the end of March. Times Co. had said in October
2010 that it would repay the loan in January 2012, three years
ahead of the original repayment date. By repaying next month,
the Times said it will save $39 million in annual interest
expenses.  The prepayment won’t affect the timing of Slim’s decision
on when to exercise the warrants, Elias said.  “That decision will be taken in its proper moment,” he
said. The billionaire chose to hold on to his warrants even when
Times Co.’s share price closed at $14.67 on Jan. 11, 2010, its
highest close since he obtained the warrants.  Slim’s Stake  In addition to the warrants, Slim holds 10.05 million Times
Co. class A shares, or a 6.9 percent stake in that class of
shares. Times Co.’s controlling family owns most of the class B
shares, which carry the right to elect 70 percent of the board
of directors.  Slim’s publicly disclosed investments, including the Times
Co. stake, are worth $72.1 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Most of his holdings are in Mexico, and his Latin
American phone carrier, America Movil SAB, represents about 59
percent of that fortune. His Mexican companies also include his
Inbursa financial group, a mining outfit, construction, real
estate and retail.  Outside of Mexico, Slim also holds 16 percent of luxury
retailer  Saks Inc. (SKS) ’s shares and stakes of less than 1 percent in
Spanish financial-services firm CaixaBank and cigarette seller
Philip Morris International Inc.  ‘Significantly Strengthened’  Slim made money on the loan deal, netting interest payments
of $35.1 million a year, a $4.5 million “investor funding fee”
as part of the 2009 loan agreement, getting a premium fee for
the prepayment and obtaining the warrants, which would have
netted $38.5 million as of yesterday’s close.  His acquisition of shares in Times Co. has been less
fruitful. Of his 10.05 million shares, 9.1 million were obtained
before September 2008 at undisclosed prices. In the two years
before that, shares closed no lower than $12.16, 38 percent
higher than yesterday’s closing price.  “Over the past two years we have significantly
strengthened the Times Company’s cash position,” Chief
Executive Officer and President Janet Robinson said in the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
