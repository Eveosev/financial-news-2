Muhammad Ali  Enterprises LLC accused
digital bookseller Kobo Inc. in a lawsuit of using the former boxer’s “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” slogan in
an advertisement without permission.  The trademark-infringement complaint, filed yesterday in
federal court in  Manhattan , alleges that Toronto-based Kobo
improperly used the slogan last month in a New York Times
advertisement for its eReader, an electronic book-reading
device.  Ali’s slogan is a registered trademark, which is licensed
to third parties, according to the complaint. Ali, 69, seeks a
court order blocking Kobo’s use of the slogan and unspecified
damages.  The advertisement “made commercial use of the Muhammad Ali
slogan and Muhammad Ali’s name without permission from or
compensation to Muhammad Ali Enterprises,” according to the
complaint.  The slogan and Ali’s name was the most prominent wording on
the advertising page, and underneath the expression, according
to the complaint, the ad read: “Lightweight. Powerful.
Intuitive. The new Kobo eReader Touch Edition. Just in time for
Father’s Day.”  Kobo, in an e-mailed statement, said the company’s legal
team is handling the matter and declined to comment further.  Ali won 56 of 61 professional boxing matches, 37 by
knockout, during a 21-year career that saw him crowned heavy-
weight champion of the world three times, according to ESPN.com.
He retired in 1981.  The case is Muhammad Ali Enterprises v. Kobo Inc., 11-
04825, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
