Russia ’s Central federal district is
forecast to have temperatures of about 4 degrees to 7 degrees
Celsius (7.2 degrees to 12.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal
July 15-19, the Federal Hydrometeorological Center  said  on its
website today.  In the Smolensk, Tver, Yaroslavl and Kostroma regions,
temperatures will rise to 32 degrees Celsius, with the rest of
the territory reaching up to 34 degrees Celsius, the center
said. On July 17-19, temperatures will reach as high as 37
degrees Celsius in central black-earth regions of Kursk,
Belgorod, Voronezh and Tambov and in adjacent regions of Orel
and Lipetsk.  The abnormally hot temperatures and lack of rain means
there will be a high probability of wildfires in the eastern
part of Russia’s Southern federal district and in the south of
the Volga federal district in the next three days, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
