Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced,
snapping two days of losses, as investors increased holdings of
the nation’s bonds and stocks to benefit from faster economic
growth.  Gross domestic product may expand 6.3 percent to 6.8
percent this year, after growing 6.1 percent in 2010,  Bank
Indonesia  Governor Darmin Nasution told reporters in Jakarta
yesterday. Consumer-price increases, which eased to a 12-month
low of 5.54 percent in June, may reach 4 percent to 6 percent in
2011, Nasution said.  Global funds  boosted holdings of  government
bonds  by 22 percent this year through July 8 to 239.3 trillion
rupiah ($27.9 billion), according to latest figures from the
debt management office.  “Positive comments from Bank Indonesia are supporting the
rupiah,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank
Commonwealth in Jakarta. “Growth is strong and inflation has
been tamed. That’s supporting appetite for Indonesian assets.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.4 percent to 8,548 per dollar as
of 4:25 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest gain since July 1, when the currency advanced
0.5 percent.  Overseas investors purchased $1.7 billion more Indonesian
shares than they sold this year, exchange data show.  Ten-year benchmark bonds were little changed today. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 was unchanged at
7.32 percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
