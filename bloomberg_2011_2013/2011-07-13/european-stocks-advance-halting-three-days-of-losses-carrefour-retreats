European stocks rose, halting three
days of losses for the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as
China posted economic growth that beat forecasts, offsetting
Moody’s Investors Service’s downgrade of Ireland’s debt to junk.
U.S. index futures and Asian shares advanced.  ASML Holding NV (ASML)  tumbled 5.6 percent after Europe’s biggest
semiconductor-equipment maker reported second-quarter orders
that missed its own forecast.  Carrefour SA (CA)  fell 1 percent as the
world’s second-largest retailer by sales posted second-quarter
sales growth that trailed analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx 600 increased 0.3 percent to 269.01 at 8:29 a.m.
in London. The gauge had fallen 2.8 percent over the past three
days as investors speculated that the euro area’s sovereign-debt
crisis would spread to the bigger economies of Italy and Spain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
