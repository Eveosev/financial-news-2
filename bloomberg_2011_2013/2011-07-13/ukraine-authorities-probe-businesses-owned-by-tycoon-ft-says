Ukrainian authorities have carried
out law-enforcement investigations this week at several
businesses owned by Kostyantin Zhevago, a tycoon and supporter
of Yulia Tymoshenko, who was defeated in presidential elections
last year, the Financial Times reported.  The probes included a raid by armed state security officers
on  Rosava (ROSA) , a tiremaker, which appealed to President Viktor Yanukovich yesterday for an explanation, the newspaper said.  Zhevago is a member of the Ukrainian parliament, where he’s
a member of Tymoshenko’s political bloc, the FT said.  The newspaper cited Vadym Karasiov, a political consultant,
as saying that Yanukovich is showing he “does not want to be a
puppet of Ukraine’s long-dominant oligarchs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
