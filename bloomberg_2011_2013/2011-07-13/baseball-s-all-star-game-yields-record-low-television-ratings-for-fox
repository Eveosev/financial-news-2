Major League Baseball  drew the
lowest television ratings for its All-Star Game in the history
of the midseason exhibition, down 8 percent from a year ago.  The National League’s 5-1 win over the American League on
Fox last night in Phoenix had a 6.9 rating, down from 7.5 last
year, the  News Corp. (NWS)  network said.  The 2010 rating was the previous low.  Fox also said the All-Star Game was the most-watched
television program on any channel last night and the network’s
highest-rated show since the “American Idol” finale on May 25.
The ratings surpassed the most recent for horse racing’s
 Kentucky Derby , Game 7 of the National Hockey League’s Stanley
Cup Final and the last round of golf’s  U.S. Open .  Eric Shanks, co-president and chief operating officer of
Fox Sports Media Group, said last week in a telephone interview
that the All-Star Game remains a success even though it’s
competing with popular cable programming options that didn’t
exist 10 years ago. Nielsen Co. data for the All-Star Game dates
back to 1967, when it drew a 25.6 rating.  “The fact that sports and an event like the All-Star Game
can deliver a rating in the sevens and high single digits I
think is amazing considering people are being pulled in a bunch
of different directions,” Shanks said.  The NL has won the last two All-Star Games, having ended a
13-game winless streak in 2010. The NL now holds a 42-38-2
advantage in the all-time results and its champion will get home
field advantage in this year’s  World Series .  To contact the reporter on this story:
