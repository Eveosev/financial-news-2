The  Chevron Corp (CVX) .-led Caspian
Pipeline Consortium will reduce daily crude exports from the
 Black Sea  by 4.3 percent next month, a preliminary loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 24 cargoes totaling 2.52
million metric tons of crude oil in August. That’s equivalent to
19.6 million barrels, or 630,999 barrels a day, in August,
compared with 659,573 barrels a day this month, according to the
loading plan.  The final shipment plan for August will be released later
this month.  The CPC pipeline carries 650,000 barrels a day of crude
from Kazakhstan’s western fields to its  oil terminal  close to
Russia’s Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. CPC Blend was first
loaded in October 2001, according to the  website  of the group.  CPC Blend is a light, sweet or low-sulfur grade, meaning it
can produce more profitable fuels such as gasoline and diesel.
It has a density of 44.2 degrees on the American Petroleum
Institute scale and a sulfur content of 0.53 percent, according
to Chevron. The conversion factor from a ton to a barrel is
7.77.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
