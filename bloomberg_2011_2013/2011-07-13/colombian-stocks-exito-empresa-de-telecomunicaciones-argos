traded retailer, fell 0.1 percent to 22,000 pesos, after earlier
declining to 21,460, a nine-month low. The company dropped for a

stake in Uruguayan supermarkets from majority shareholder Casino
Guichard-Perrachon SA, according to a July 6 regulatory filing.  Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)  , Colombia’s biggest cement

14.8 percent in May from a year ago, according to the statistics
agency.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota (ETB)  SA, the
phone company serving Colombia’s capital, fell the most in 10
months after Bogota’s mayor announced a plan to avoid the sale
of the company as the city council began debating the issue.  Acting mayor Clara Lopez, of the Polo Democratico party,
said she is seeking alliances with other state-run companies in
 Asia  to avoid having to sell ETB, according to an interview with
El Espectador yesterday. The stock fell 6.7 percent, the most
since Sept. 6, to 680 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
