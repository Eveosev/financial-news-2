 Kishor Ostwal, managing director of
CNI Research, comments on the outlook for Indian equities after
three bomb blasts hit  Mumbai  killing at least 10 people.  The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or
Sensex, rose 1 percent to 18,596.02 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, halting a three-day decline. The explosions occured at
about 7 p.m., according to the police.  “There is sufficient time to analyze the incident before
the market opens tomorrow. I do not anticipate a knee-jerk
reaction. Foreign institutions, who are the major drivers, do
not linger on these kind of domestic issues for long. Retail
investor sentiment may get affected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
