Assets in U.S. exchange-traded funds
may double to $2 trillion before the end of 2015, driven by the
growth of non-traditional products,  Bank of New York Mellon
Corp. (BK)  and consulting firm Strategic Insight said.  U.S. ETFs will see the most expansion from commodity-based,
leveraged, actively managed, hedge fund-like and other
alternative products, according to a statement today from the
firms. Non-traditional funds have grown to an estimated 30
percent of ETF assets as of March 31, from 18 percent at the end
of 2008, according to the statement.  “The next wave of growth for ETFs is being driven by new
asset classes, new indexes and new ways to use ETFs as tools for
portfolio construction,” Joseph Keenan, head of global ETF
services at New York-based BNY Mellon, said in the statement.  ETF industry assets in the U.S. surged 15-fold to $992
billion in the decade ended Dec. 31, data from the Investment
Company Institute show. Stock and bond mutual funds rose 76
percent to $9.01 trillion in the same span, according to the
Washington-based trade group.  The study identified traditional ETFs as those tracking
indexes in the most popular investing categories, such as large-
company stocks or shares of companies seen as undervalued. ETFs
typically track an index and, unlike mutual funds, trade like
stocks throughout the day on an exchange.  BNY Mellon is the largest custody bank with $25.5 trillion
under custody and administration. New York-based Strategic
Insight advises investment-management companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
