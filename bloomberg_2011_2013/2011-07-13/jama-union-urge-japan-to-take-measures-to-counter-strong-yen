Leaders of  Japan ’s auto industry
urged the government to take “immediate and effective”
measures as the yen reached a four-month high against the dollar
and euro.  “The yen has exceeded the level where we can cope by
cutting costs,” Toshiyuki Shiga, chairman of the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association, and Koichiro Nishihara,
president of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers’
Unions, said today in  a joint statement .  If the trend continues, it is inevitable that
reconstruction efforts following the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami would be affected, they said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
