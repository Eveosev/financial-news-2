Italy’s soccer champion AC Milan
says its owner, Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi , is
committed to keeping the club and speculation about plans to
dilute his stake are inaccurate.  Daily newspaper Il Sore 24 Ore yesterday reported AC Milan,
bought by Berlusconi in 1986, was considering selling shares in
an initial public offering in  Hong Kong  or selling a minority
stake.  “I want to reassure fans President Berlusconi is staying
with all the enthusiasm that he’s always shown,” the team’s
Chief executive officer Adriano Galliani said in comments
published on AC Milan’s website.  Fininvest on July 9 was ordered to pay a 540 million-euro
($762 million) fine to Compagnie Industriali Riunite SpA
following a 2009 ruling that it bribed a judge during a takeover
battle for publisher  Arnoldo Mondadori Editore SpA. (MN)   In April Berlusconi’s daughter Barbara joined his son Paolo
as a director with the seven-time European champion. Milan,
which had an annual loss of 69.8 million euros, last season won
its first league title since 2004.  “I also want to reassure fans on the commitment of the
group for AC Milan to reach all the prestigious goals we have,”
Barbara Berlusconi said, according to the Ansa news agency.
“I’m convinced that the love of my father for Milan is too
big.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
