GDF Suez (GSZ) ’s liquefied natural gas
terminal near  Boston  is scheduled to receive a cargo July 30,
according to vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Maran Gas Coronis, the tanker carrying the shipment, can
move as much as 145,700 cubic meters of LNG, or about 3.14
billion cubic feet of gas, equivalent to 4.8 percent of
estimated daily U.S. gas production.  GDF Suez operates the Everett terminal, which can send
about 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day into the regional
pipeline network, according to  the company.  GDF’s Neptune
offshore LNG terminal, which consists of a buoy system, is also
near Boston.  LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
