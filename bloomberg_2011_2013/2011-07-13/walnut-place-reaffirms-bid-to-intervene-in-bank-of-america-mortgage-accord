A group of investors operating under
the name Walnut Place reaffirmed their request to intervene in a
New York state court case in which a judge will decide whether
to approve an $8.5 billion settlement by  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
tied to mortgage-securitization trusts.  The motion filed today in Manhattan comes a day after it
was revealed that New York Attorney General  Eric Schneiderman  is
seeking client information from more than 20 companies as part
of a probe of the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
