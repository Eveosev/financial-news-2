Ukraine’s government aims to finish
buying 3 million metric tons of grain through a state-run fund
within two months.  “It has to be done within one and a half or two months,”
Serhiy Lobas, deputy head of the Agrarian Fund, said today at a
press conference in Kiev. The purchases will help grain
producers finance winter planting and further harvesting, he
said.  Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov ’s government is concerned that
domestic grain prices have dropped too low after legislators
voted in May to impose export duties on wheat, corn and barley.
President  Viktor Yanukovych  signed the bill last month.  “The price proposed by the Agrarian Fund is the best on
the market now,” Henadiy Novikov, head of the Agrarian Union,
representing leading Ukrainian agricultural producers, said at
the press conference.  The government should scrap export duties “immediately”
to lower grain producers’ costs, Novikov also said. Supplies
from Ukraine are unable to compete with “large amounts” of
Russian grain offered on the Black Sea market, he said.  The fund has so far made forward purchases of 859,000 tons
of grain for state reserves, with wheat making up 97 percent,
Lobas said.  Ukraine imposed export duties of 14 percent on barley, 12
percent on corn and 9 percent on wheat. A Russian ban on all
cereal exports put in place last year expired July 1 as
scheduled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
