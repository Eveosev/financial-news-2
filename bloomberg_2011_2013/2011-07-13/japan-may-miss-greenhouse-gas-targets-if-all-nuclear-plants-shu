Japan ’s greenhouse gas emissions may
rise by as much as 16 percent from 1990 levels should the
country’s nuclear reactors be shut down, raising questions about
its ability to meet carbon-dioxide reduction targets.  C02 emissions will increase by as much 210 million metric
tons in the year to March 2013 should all reactors be closed and
replaced by thermal plants, Yusuke Nakamura, a deputy director
at the low-carbon society promotion office in Japan’s
 Environment Ministry , said by phone today.  That would translate into an increase of as much as 16
percent in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 for the year
ending March 2013, he said. Under the  Kyoto Protocol  signed in
1997, Japan committed to reducing the gases responsible for
global warming to 6 percent less than 1990 levels by 2012.  The figure was calculated by the ministry in response to a
question from a member of parliament and doesn’t take into
account power-saving measures introduced after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami knocked out  power plants  in Japan.  About two-thirds of Japan’s 54 reactors have been shut down
after the quake and tsunami caused the Fukushima nuclear crisis
or because of regular checks. Japan may have no nuclear reactors
running by May next year if the round of tests the government is
planning cause further delays in restarting units idled for
maintenance, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Japan’s greenhouse gas emissions for the year ended March
2010 totaled 1.209 billion metric tons, the latest figure
available,  the ministry said  in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
