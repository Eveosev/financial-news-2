Trading houses led Japanese stocks
higher for the first time in three days after Credit Suisse
Group AG initiated coverage of the sector with an “overweight”
rating, and China’s economic growth beat estimates, improving
the outlook for Japan’s biggest export market.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and Mitsui & Co., the country’s top
commodity traders, gained after Credit Suisse said shares were
cheap.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a maker of construction equipment that
counts China as its largest market, gained 0.8 percent.  Sony
Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics,
reversed earlier declines after the yen eased from its strongest
level in four months amid speculation Japan will sell its
currency to protect exporters.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.4 percent to 9,963.14
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo . The gauge earlier lost as much as
0.4 percent after Moody’s Investors Service yesterday cut
Ireland’s investment rating to junk status, adding to concern
Europe’s debt crisis will spread. The Topix advanced 0.4 percent.  “You get the sense that stocks aren’t reacting to bad
news,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee the equivalent
of $18 billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co.
in Tokyo. “A bottom is firming up because Japanese shares are
still cheap relative to earnings estimates.”  Quake Rebound  The Topix has lost 24 trillion yen ($300 billion) in market
value, or 7.6 percent, since March 10, the day before the
earthquake and tsunami that devastated  Japan ’s northeast. The
gauge has risen 5.9 percent in the past month as manufacturers
including Toyota Motor Corp. said they are restoring production
and amid increasing confidence Greece would avoid a default.  Stocks reversed earlier declines and the yen weakened today
after Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said the
currency’s moves have been ‘a bit one-sided’ and he is watching
markets carefully. The yen weakened 1.4 percent against the
dollar after earlier trading at its highest level against the
greenback since March 17, a day before Group of Seven nations
intervened to halt its advance.  Sony gained 0.6 percent to 2,149 yen, after falling as much
as 1.2 percent. Honda Motor Corp., Japan’s second-largest
carmaker, increased 0.2 percent to 3,175 yen.  Stocks climbed after a report  China ’s economy grew 9.5
percent in the second quarter, easing from a 9.7 percent pace in
the previous three months. Authorities in the world’s second-
largest economy have tried to cool inflation by raising  interest
rates  and capping the amount of money banks can lend. Investors
have been concerned the measures would choke the economy’s
expansion.  ‘Hard-Landing’  “China is managing to cool growth, and that should go a
long way towards easing the ‘hard-landing’ fears,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based strategist for AMP Capital Investors Ltd.,
which manages about $100 billion. “The fact that growth is
softening should also allow the authorities to take their foot
off the monetary brake.”  Komatsu, which sells about a quarter of its excavators and
bulldozers in China, advanced 0.8 percent to 2,480 yen.  Fanuc
Corp. (6954) , a maker of factory automation tools that gets about half
its sales in Asia, gained 1.3 percent to 14,050 yen.  Trading companies led advances on the Topix after Credit
Suisse analyst Yuji Nishiyama started coverage of the sector
with an “overweight” rating, citing low valuations. Mitsubishi
gained 1.8 percent to 2,069 yen.  Most Undervalued  Mitsui, which Credit Suisse said was the most undervalued
of Japan’s major trading houses, rallied 2.1 percent to 1,432
yen. Shares of the company trade at 5.7 times estimated earnings,
compared with an average of 15.9 for the Topix index.  “The major trading company stocks are oversold,”
Nishiyama said in a report. “Full year-earnings are likely to
beat company targets, even if resource prices do not return to
an upward trajectory.”  Energy companies rose after crude prices gained yesterday
by the most in two weeks.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the country’s No. 1 oil
driller, climbed 2.1 percent to 596,000 yen.  Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. (1662) , the No. 2, gained 1 percent to 3,925 yen.  Crude oil for August delivery climbed 2.4 percent to settle
at $97.43 a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the biggest one-day
gain since June 28. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices
for six metals including copper and aluminum jumped 1 percent.  Among stocks that fell, semiconductor-related companies
declined after Novellus Systems Inc., a U.S. manufacturer of
chipmaking tools, forecast profit that missed analyst estimates.
 Nikon Corp. (7731) , a maker of lithography equipment, dropped 2.7
percent to 1,810 yen, the most on the Nikkei.  Tokyo Electron
Ltd. (8035) , Japan’s biggest maker of semiconductor equipment, lost 1.6
percent to 4,300 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
