Seth Freeman, chief executive
officer at EM Capital Management LLC in  San Francisco , comments
on the outlook for Indian equities after three bomb blasts hit
the nation’s financial capital, killing at least 10 people.  The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or
Sensex, rose 1 percent to 18,596.02 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, halting a three-day decline. The explosions occurred at
about 7 p.m., according to the police.  Today’s attack is the first in the city since Pakistani
gunmen killed about 160 people in November 2008.  “This is going to make some foreign investors question the
domestic stability and further raise the issue of terrorism as a
risk of investing in emerging markets, especially India.  ‘‘The market was very resilient after 26/11,’’ he said,
refering to the Nov. 26, 2008 attack. ‘‘The immediate reaction
should be moderate as such events have occurred in the past. It
shouldn’t affect anyone’s long-term view on  India .”  “The global reaction will depend on the assessment of who
is responsible for these acts. If it is an international
terrorist group, the reaction may be a bit severe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
