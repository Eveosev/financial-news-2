Aluminum stockpiles monitored by the
 London  Metal Exchange declined for a 35th day.  Inventories of the lightweight metal fell 6,275 metric tons
to 4.42 million tons, LME data showed today. They are at the
lowest level since Jan. 12, falling 4.2 percent in June, the
biggest monthly decline since July 2006.  Most declines were registered in the U.S. and the U.K.
Inventories in Hull,  England , have fallen 45 percent since the
end of May, while Liverpool stockpiles are down 16 percent.
Total orders to draw aluminum from LME warehouses, known as
canceled warrants, fell 7,250 tons to 382,000 tons.  The outflow of stocks from more diversified locations “is
most likely to be metal merely shifting between warehouses,”
according to Standard Bank Plc analysts. “Indeed, some of this
metal may well be moving from on-warrant to off-warrant
locations confusing underlying fundamental supply demand
picture,” analysts including  Leon Westgate  in London said in a
monthly report yesterday.  Aluminum stockpiles in  Japan  gained 1.4 percent in June
from a month earlier to the highest level in nine months,
Marubeni Corp., the largest Japanese importer of the metal, said
today. It was the highest level since September.  Copper canceled warrants rose 2,425 tons, or 14 percent, to
20,175 tons, with most orders registered in Gwangyang,  South
Korea . Stockpiles advanced 350 tons to 461,975 tons, according
to the LME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
