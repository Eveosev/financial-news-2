Oprah Winfrey , whose syndicated talk
show ended in May after 25 years, will become chief executive
officer of Oprah Winfrey Network after ratings at her six-month-
old cable channel fell below expectations.  Winfrey will take over from interim CEO Peter Liguori, the
chief operating officer of  Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) , which
co-owns the channel with Winfrey, according to a statement
today. OWN, which started Jan. 1, dismissed former CEO Christina Norman in May.  Winfrey, 57, is expanding her role as chairman of the
network, also adding the role of chief creative officer. The
channel, which currently shows reruns of “Dr. Phil” and “What
Not to Wear,” will debut new programs in the next six months,
including “Rosie,” “In the Bedroom with Dr. Laura Berman”
and “Oprah’s Next Chapter.”  Erik Logan and Sheri Salata, presidents of Winfrey-owned
Harpo Studios, were appointed presidents of OWN.  Discovery Communications, based in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland ,
rose 10 cents to $41.98 at 10:05 a.m. New York time in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. The shares were little changed this year
before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
