Angola’s economic growth will pick
up in 2012 after falling below forecast this year, and may even
exceed 10 percent, President Jose Eduardo  Dos Santos  said.  The government reduced its growth forecast to 3.4 percent
today from 3.6 percent, Dos Santos told reporters in the
capital, Luanda.  The country is still reeling from the effects of the global
financial crisis that depleted its foreign-currency reserves,
the president said. It is also seeing a shortfall in oil output
because of maintenance work and depleted reserves in some
fields, according to oil ministry.  Oil output will decline to 620.5 million barrel this year
from the 693 million barrels forecast in the country’s spending
budget for 2011, according to Finance Ministry estimates
submitted to lawmakers on June 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
