Zimbabwe will probably post a budget
deficit of $500 million this year, Finance Minister  Tendai Biti 
said.  The government won’t have a supplementary budget this year
as it doesn’t have sufficient revenue to fund an increase in
spending, Biti told lawmakers in the capital, Harare, today. The
budget of $2.7 billion for 2011 requires revenue collection of
$230 million a month, Biti said.  Government spending  will need to be curbed since the budget
doesn’t include expenditure on a constitutional referendum that
must be held this year, the minister said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
