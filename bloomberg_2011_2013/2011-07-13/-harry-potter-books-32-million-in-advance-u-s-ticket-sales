“ Harry Potter  and the Deathly
Hallows: Part 2” has generated $32 million in advance U.S.
ticket sales, setting the stage for one of Hollywood’s biggest
opening weekends.  More than 3,800 locations will show the film starting at
midnight tomorrow, Burbank, California-based  Warner Bros . said
today in an e-mailed statement. The number will increase on July
15 to 4,375 locations, the most of any Potter movie, said the
studio, a unit of  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)   The film, the first in the series to be shown completely in
3-D, is getting a lift from higher prices charged for the
format. The movie, playing in 3-D at more than 3,000 locations,
may take in as much as $153 million over the weekend, according
to Box Office Media LLC’s Boxoffice.com. That would be the
second-best  opening  after the $158.4 million recorded in 2008
for “The  Dark Knight ,” also a Warner release.  “ Deathly Hallows : Part 2” is the eighth film based on the
books by  J.K. Rowling . In the film, Harry faces a final showdown
the evil Lord Voldemort and his followers.  The first seven films have taken in $6.37 billion in
worldwide ticket sales, according to researcher  Box Office Mojo .  Portions of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix”
and “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” were converted to
three dimensions for screenings in Imax theaters.  Warner Bros. abandoned plans to release “Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” in the format, saying in an Oct.
8, 2010, statement that the conversion didn’t meet the studio’s
quality standards.  To contact the reporters on this story:
