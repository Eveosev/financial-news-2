Oil fell from a three-day high
in  New York  on speculation that growing U.S. supplies may signal
slowing demand for fuel.  Futures reversed earlier gains as investors bet that
stockpiles in the U.S. fell less than analysts predicted, after
the  American Petroleum Institute  said yesterday crude
inventories rose for the first time in six weeks. Analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey had forecast supplies shrank before the
Energy Department’s report today in Washington.  “Near-term direction will be down to the Energy Department
statistics due out this afternoon,”  Glen Ward , head of retail
derivatives at London Capital Group Ltd., said in a note.  Crude for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was down 51 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $96.92 a barrel
at 1:45 p.m. London time. It earlier rose as much as 53 cents
$97.96, the highest price since July 7.  Brent oil for August settlement declined 66 cents to
$117.09 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. That
took the European benchmark to a premium of $20.17 a barrel to
U.S. futures, down from $20.32 at settlement yesterday and a
record close of $22.29 on June 15.  The Energy Department may say today U.S. supplies dropped
1.5 million barrels, according to the median of 15 analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Crude inventories climbed 2.3 million barrels last week to
359.4 million, the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute
report showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
