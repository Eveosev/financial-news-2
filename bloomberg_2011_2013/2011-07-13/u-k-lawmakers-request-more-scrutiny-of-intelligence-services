U.K. Lawmakers tasked with
scrutinizing the intelligence services have requested the power
to insist those agencies answer their questions, as part of a
wider revision of their role.  The Intelligence and Security Committee, made up of members
from the lower and upper houses of the U.K. Parliament, reports
on the activities of the Security Service, known as MI5, the
Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, and the Government
Communications Headquarters. It produces an annual report for
the prime minister, a censored version of which is published.  Today’s report  recommends the panel should get the power to
investigate operations, on top of its current oversight of
policy, administration and finances. Only government ministers
should be able to say an agency should refuse to answer the
committee’s questions on a subject, it said. At present,
agency heads make that decision.  “Public expectation in terms of transparency and openness
has increased significantly,” Malcolm Rifkind, the Conservative
lawmaker who chairs the committee, said in an e-mailed
statement. “We must ensure that the committee now has the
powers and remit that are necessary to provide reassurance to
the public and to Parliament.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
