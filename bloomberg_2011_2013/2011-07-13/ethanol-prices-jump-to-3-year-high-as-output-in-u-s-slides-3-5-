Ethanol prices jumped to a three-
year high as production in the U.S. sank 3.5 percent to 872,000
barrels a day last week.  Prices rose as much as 2.3 percent as output fell the most
since the week ended June 10, according to the Energy
Department. Stockpiles climbed 1.2 percent to 18.8 million
barrels, enough supply for 21.3 days, the department said,
rebounding from the lowest level since January.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
fell 1.5 percent to 5.2 million barrels a day, from a record
5.26. Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of
ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery jumped 5.7 cents, or
2.1 percent, to $2.826 a gallon at 10:46 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices touched $2.833, the highest
intraday level since July 3, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
