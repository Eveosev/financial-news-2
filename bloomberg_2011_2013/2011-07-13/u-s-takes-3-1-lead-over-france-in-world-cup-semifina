Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan scored
within three minutes of each other to give the U.S. a 3-1 lead
over  France  in the second half of their Women’s  World Cup 
semifinal.  Wambach scored with a header in the 79th minute and then
Morgan chipped in a goal in the 82nd minute. France’s Sonia
Bompastor scored on a long shot in the 55th minute to even the
score at 1-1. Lauren Cheney opened the scoring in
Moenchengladbach,  Germany  by directing in a cross from Heather
O’Reilly in the ninth minute.  France controlled the midfield for much of the half, but
could only hit 3 long shots, while the U.S. scored on its only
shot on goal. Bompastor hit the crossbar in the 33rd minute,
while six minutes later Abby Wambach of the U.S. couldn’t head
home after beating the goalkeeper.  The winner will play the victor of today’s semifinal in
 Frankfurt  between Japan and Sweden in the July 17 final. The
Americans have beaten France in 11 of the 13 times they’ve
played.  The U.S. is trying to win its third Women’s World Cup after

semifinal. The Americans won the shootout 5-3 after the match
finished 2-2 after extra time.  France is in its second Women’s World Cup, after playing in
the 2003 event in the U.S. The French won 11 of their 12
qualifying matches for this year’s tournament, and outscored its
competitors, 53-2. The team beat  England  in the quarterfinal in
