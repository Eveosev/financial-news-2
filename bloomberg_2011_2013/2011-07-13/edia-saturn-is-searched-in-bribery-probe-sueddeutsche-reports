Metro AG (MEO) â€™s consumer-electronics
chain Media Saturn will fire a manager who was arrested in a
bribery probe, company spokesman Sven Jacobsen said.  Media Saturn, which is cooperating with prosecutors, may
also seek damages over the issue, he said. Five suspects have
been arrested in the case,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing
prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz.  The probe, led by prosecutors in Augsburg,  Germany , is
looking into allegations that a businessman bribed Media Saturn
managers to win digital subscriber line contracts, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
