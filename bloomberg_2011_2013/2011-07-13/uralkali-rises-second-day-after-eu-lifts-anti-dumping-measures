OAO  Uralkali (URKA)  climbed to the highest
closing price in almost three years after European Union anti-
dumping measures for Russian and Belarusian potassium chloride
deliveries expired.  Shares of the world’s largest potash producer by output
added 3.5 percent to 268.41 rubles at the 6:45 p.m. close in
Moscow, the strongest closing level since August 2008.  The EU measures  expired  today after five years, European
Commission spokeswoman Helene Banner said in an e-mailed
response to questions. The tariffs were prolonged in 2006 to
shield EU producers including K+S AG from cheaper imports. The
product is a fertilizer and fertilizer ingredient.  “There is a marginally positive effect for Uralkali from
the lifting of quotas that restricted  Russia ’s and Belarus’s
access to this market,” VTB Capital analysts Elena Sakhnova and
Kevin Whyte said in an e-mailed report today.  Europe  represents 11 percent of the global market for
potash and 1 percent of the net profit for Uralkali and OAO
Silvinit, with which it is merging, VTB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
