Serbia’s  Commission for Protection
of Competition  ruled that  Delhaize Group SA (DELB)  can take over Delta
Maxi Group, the biggest supermarket chain in the Balkan country.  The decision enables Delhaize to complete the 932.5
million-euro ($1.31 billion) takeover agreed on in March to
acquire the Belgrade-based retailer of 450 stores in Serbia,
 Montenegro , Bosnia, Albania and  Bulgaria .  The acquisition increases Delhaize’s presence in the
Balkans, which is expected to grow 5 percent to 7 percent a year
in the next four years, according to the Belgium grocer’s
estimates.  The regulator today approved the takeover as it “will not
lead to a significant limitation, infringement of prevention of
competition on the market” of Serbia, according to an e-mailed
 statement .  In its request for approval, Delhaize said it would take
over Delta Maxi’s existing operations without adding any related
businesses that would increase market share. Delta Maxi’s
supermarkets have about 22 percent of the Serbian market.  The Commission welcomed Delhaize’s arrival, saying it will
benefit local producers who may become Delhaize suppliers in
 Serbia  and abroad.  Delhaize said in March it would finance the transaction
from cash holdings and existing credit lines. It was also agreed
that the purchase would include about 300 million euros of Delta
Maxi’s debt, net of cash acquired, as well as the real estate of
more than half of the 350 stores in Serbia and seven
distribution centers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
