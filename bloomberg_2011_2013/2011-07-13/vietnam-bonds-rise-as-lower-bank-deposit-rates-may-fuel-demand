Vietnam ’s bonds gained on
speculation decreases in deposit rates at banks may bolster the
amount of cash available to buy government debt.  Deposit rates are showing signs of falling and there is
surplus cash in the market, the central bank said on July 8.  “Bond yields will probably slide with the drop in deposit
rates” as banks have more cash to invest in  government
securities , said Nguyen Tuan Phong, the Hanoi-based fixed-income
manager at Bao Viet Fund Management Co., a unit of Vietnam’s
biggest insurer.  The yield on the benchmark five-year note declined five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 12.44 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The dong was unchanged at 20,575 per dollar as of 5:31 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,608 today,
the same as the previous two days, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Anil Varma  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
