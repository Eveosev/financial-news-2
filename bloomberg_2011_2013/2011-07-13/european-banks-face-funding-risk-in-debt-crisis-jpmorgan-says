European banks such as  BNP Paribas (BNP) 
SA and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  may struggle to raise funds because
investors are concerned about the impact of the sovereign-debt
crisis spreading in the region, JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said.  The two lenders, along with  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , are the most
at risk, the analysts, led by  Kian Abouhossein , wrote in a note
to clients today. U.S. funds have been cutting their exposure to
banks in the euro area, they said.  “U.S. investors in particular are getting more and more
worried about funding of European banks,” the analysts wrote.  European Central Bank executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on July 11 that the link between sovereign risk and
bank risk is potentially “explosive.” The euro fell to a four-
month low against the dollar as the financial contagion spreads
to Italy from  Greece , Ireland and Portugal.  Losses on  government bonds  may also weigh on banks that
have lower core Tier 1 ratios, according to JPMorgan.  Credit
Agricole ,  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  will need to
raise capital or sell assets, the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
