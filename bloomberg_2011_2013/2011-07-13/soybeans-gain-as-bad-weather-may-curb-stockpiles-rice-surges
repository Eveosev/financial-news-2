Soybeans gained for the eighth day
on speculation stockpiles will be less than forecast by the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  and rice surged to the highest since
2008 as supplies may fall. Corn rose, erasing earlier losses.  Wet weather slowed planting of soybeans earlier this year
and hot, dry weather this weekend and next week will increase
stress to developing crops in the western and southern Midwest
of the U.S., the biggest shipper of the oilseed. Yesterday the
USDA  forecast  U.S. soybean stockpiles at 175 million bushels,
above trade estimates of 167 million, Rabobank International
said in a report today.  “There is a risk of future downgrades given the delayed
plantings and the developing unfavorable weather pattern in the
U.S.,” London-based Rabobank analysts led by Luke Chandler said
in a report today. “This will cause the trade to increasingly
watch the USDA’s weekly crop-progress reports and  weather
forecasts .”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 8.75 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $13.67 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade, climbing for the longest rally since
August. The price has gained 5.6 percent since June 30, its last
decline.  Rice gained as U.S. supplies in 2011-2012 are expected by
the USDA to decline 6 percent to 256.6 million hundredweight and
stockpiles before the 2012 harvest will fall 30 percent to 29.6
million hundredweight. The U.S. is the world’s third-largest
exporter.  Rice for September delivery rose 37 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to $16.56 per 100 pounds, and earlier jumped to $16.67, the most
expensive price since October 2008 on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Futures have gained 12 percent this month.  Corn for December delivery gained 5.75 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $6.6375 a bushel in Chicago. The price yesterday
gained 4 percent, the biggest jump since June 28.  Wheat for September delivery rose 8 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $6.80 a bushel. The grain jumped 5.1 percent yesterday, the
biggest advance since May 18. Milling wheat for November
delivery on NYSE Liffe in Paris gained 3.75 euros, or 2 percent,
to 195 euros ($274) a metric ton.  To contact the reporters on this story：
