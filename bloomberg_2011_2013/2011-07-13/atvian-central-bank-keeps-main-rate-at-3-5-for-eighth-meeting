Latvia’s central bank left its
benchmark interest rate unchanged for an eighth meeting as the
economy continues to recover from its worst recession.  The refinancing rate was held at 3.5 percent, the Riga-
based bank said in an e-mailed statement today. The bank has cut
the rate a total of 2.5 percentage points since March 2009.  Latvia’s economy is recovering after shrinking a cumulative
25 percent since 2008, the deepest contraction in the world
during the global financial crisis. Gross domestic product grew
3.5 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.  The country turned to a group led by the European
Commission and the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5
billion-euro ($10.7 billion) loan in November 2008 and has
implemented austerity measures including tax increases and
spending cuts of more than 16 percent of gross domestic product.  The refinancing rate affects the minimum interest rate on
central bank swaps and repurchase agreements, worth about 75
million lati ($148.6 million) a week. The bank runs a quasi-
currency-board system, where lati in circulation are backed by
foreign currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
