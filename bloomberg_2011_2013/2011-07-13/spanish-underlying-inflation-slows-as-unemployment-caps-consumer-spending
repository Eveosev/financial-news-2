Spanish underlying inflation slowed
in June as retailers slashed prices to lure consumers suffering
from the highest  unemployment rate  in  Europe .  Core consumer prices, which exclude energy and fresh food,
gained 1.7 percent from a year earlier, after a 2.1 percent
increase the previous month, the National Statistics Institute
in Madrid said today. Headline inflation, based on European
Union calculations, was 3 percent, matching an initial estimate
on June 30.  Spanish consumers are reining in spending as the economy
struggles to emerge from a three-year slump that pushed the
unemployment rate to 21 percent. Clothing retailers including
Mango started offering discounts of as much as 50 percent in
June at the start of the summer sales season. Spanish retail
sales posted the 11th annual decline in May.  Inflation will continue to slow in the “coming months” as
the impact of the July 2010 increase in value-added tax fades
and the surge in oil prices eases, Deputy Finance Minister Jose
Manuel Campa told reporters in  Madrid  today.  The price of crude oil has fallen 9 percent in the past
three months and traded at $97.60 at 11 a.m. in  London  today.
 Spain ’s economy is more sensitive to changes in oil prices than
the euro region on average, Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel
Fernandez Ordonez said on May 23, as he forecast Spanish
inflation would slow to below the euro-area average at the start
of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
