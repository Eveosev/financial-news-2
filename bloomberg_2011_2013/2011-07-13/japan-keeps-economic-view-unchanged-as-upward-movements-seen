Japan ’s government maintained its
assessment of the economy, saying that “upward movements” are
emerging after demand plunged in the wake of the March 11
temblor and tsunami in the northeast region.  The Cabinet Office upgraded its evaluation of  consumer
spending  and  capital spending  while downgrading its assessment
of imports, according to a monthly report released in Tokyo
today. The government raised its evaluation of the overall
economy last month.  Industrial production rose at the fastest pace in more than
50 years in May and retail sales declines eased for a second
month. Japanese companies are also forecasting increased hiring
and investment as demand picks up in the world’s third-largest
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
