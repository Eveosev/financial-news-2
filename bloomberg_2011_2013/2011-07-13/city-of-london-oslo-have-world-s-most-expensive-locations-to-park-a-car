London  has the highest monthly car
parking costs in the world and Oslo has the highest daily rate,
according to a study by real estate consulting firm  Colliers
International .  Bankers, executives and others employed in the City of
London, the U.K. capital’s main financial district, pay on
average $1,084 a month to park their vehicles in the
neighborhood, according to a study of 156 locations around the
world published by the firm today. Parking in Oslo’s business
district costs $89.04 a day, the study showed.  “London has consistently ranked as the most expensive
parking garage market in the world by a significant margin -- 25
to 35 percent over the past four years,” Ross J. Moore,
Colliers’ chief economist, said in a statement.  Parking prices increased in every region except the U.S.
during the past 12 months, according to Colliers. The cheapest
city to park in is Jakarta at 92 cents a day, $88.12 less than
in the Norwegian capital.  On a monthly basis, London’s West End district was the
second-most expensive at $1,014, followed by Zurich at $822 and
 Hong Kong  at $744.72, which edged out  Tokyo  at $744, Colliers
said. The priciest daily parking locations were Copenhagen at
$73.11 and  Melbourne  at $69.53, the study showed.  Seattle-based Colliers surveyed the costs of parking in a
covered or underground lot in 156 business districts around the
world.  Manhattan ’s midtown and downtown areas are the 17th and
18th most expensive areas at $541 and $533 a month. On a daily
basis, Midtown ranked 15th at $41 day and downtown 35th at $30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
