Cyrela Brazil Realty SA
Empreendimentos e Participacoes (CYRE3) ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, gained the most in five months after
announcing it plans to buy back as much as seven percent of its
shares outstanding.  Cyrela gained 6.2 percent to 14.66 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since
Feb. 11. The Bovespa index rose 1.6 percent to 60,669.89.  “The decision signals that, for the company, shares are
very cheap,” Armando Halfeld, a real-estate analyst at Rio de
Janeiro-based brokerage Ativa Corretora, said in a telephone
interview. “It shows the company is confident in the outlook
for its business. It’s a good sign.”  Cyrela plans to buy back as many as 21.2 million common
shares within one year, according to a regulatory filing. The
stock plunged 37 percent this year through yesterday, the
fourth-worst performance in the 67-member Bovespa index. The
gauge fell 14 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
