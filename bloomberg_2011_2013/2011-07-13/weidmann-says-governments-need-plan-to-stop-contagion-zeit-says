European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jens Weidmann said euro-region governments need
to develop a plan to stop contagion in case of a Greek default,
 Germany ’s  Zeit  newspaper reported, citing an interview.  “Politicians must have a plan to rein in the threats of
contagion in case of a failure of the Greek program,” Weidmann
told the newspaper, according to an e-mailed pre-release today.
“Member states need instruments to absorb potential negative
consequences on domestic financial systems.”  Lawmakers need to show their determination and unity to
solve the region’s fiscal crisis, said Weidmann, who is also
head of Germany’s Bundesbank. Italy can manage its problems with
its own resources, he added.  Weidmann also argued against allowing the European
Financial Stability Facility to be able to buy  government bonds 
on the secondary markets, saying the benefit would be limited.
He said the ECB uses its own judgment when assessing the quality
of collateral it accepts in refinancing operations and doesn’t
solely rely on rating companies, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
