Unga Group Ltd. (UNGL) , a Kenyan grain
miller, rose for a second day after The Star reported the first
shipment of duty-free corn had been delivered to the country
facing drought and a grain shortage.  The stock rose 0.5 percent to 10 shillings by 2:34 p.m. in
Nairobi. A close at this level would be the highest in a week.  Kenya received a shipment of 8,560 metric tons of corn from
Zambia and Malawi following drought that caused an increase in
retail prices, the Star reported, citing Boniface Mghanga, a
Kenya Ports Authority public relations officer.  The east African nation lowered the tax on imported corn to
10 percent from 50 percent, to offset the rising cost of living,
Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said in his budget speech on
June 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
