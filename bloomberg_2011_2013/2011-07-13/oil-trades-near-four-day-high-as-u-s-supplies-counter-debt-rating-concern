Oil traded near a four-day high in
 New York  after signs of rising crude demand in the U.S.
countered speculation the world’s biggest consumer of the
commodity may face a credit rating downgrade.  Futures were little changed, after slipping as much as 0.5
percent, as Moody’s Investors Service put the U.S. under review
for a rating downgrade as talks to raise its $14.3 trillion debt
limit stall. Prices advanced 0.6 percent yesterday after the
Energy Department said oil supply fell 3.1 million barrels last
week. They were projected to drop 1.5 million barrels.  Crude for August delivery was at $98.07 a barrel, up 2
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 9:03 a.m. Sydney time. The contract yesterday rose 62 cents
to $98.05, the highest close since July 7. Prices are 27 percent
higher the past year.  Brent oil for August settlement advanced $1.03, or 0.9
percent, to $118.78 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange yesterday. The European benchmark contract
settled at a premium of $20.73 a barrel to U.S. futures,
compared with a record $22.29 on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
