The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments declined 4 basis points to 280 at 9:30 a.m. in
London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Swaps on  Greece  dropped 25 basis points to 2,264,  Portugal 
declined 14 to 1,062 and  Spain  fell 16 to 308, while Italy
decreased 11 to 277 and Belgium was 5.5 lower at 185, according
to CMA. Swaps on Ireland were little changed at 1,000.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 10 basis points to
443, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.75 basis points to 117.75 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 7 basis points to 173 and the
subordinated index dropped 8 to 307.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
