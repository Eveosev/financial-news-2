The forint depreciated, heading for
the biggest four-day drop in more than seven months.  The Hungarian currency dropped 0.2 percent to 269.71 per
euro as of 1:20 p.m. in Budapest. A close at that level would
mean a 2.8 percent decline in the last four days, the most since
the four days through Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
