Irish 10-year bonds slumped for a
sixth day, sending yields to a euro-era record, after the nation
became the third in the currency union to have its  credit rating 
cut below investment grade.  German 10-year bunds fell as the nation auctioned fewer
bonds than its maximum target. Two-year Irish note yields surged
to a record, and Greek and Portuguese 10-year bonds fell, after
Moody’s Investors Service yesterday cut Ireland to Ba1 from
Baa3, saying the nation is likely to need more rescue financing.
 Italy ’s 10-year bonds were little changed, reversing an earlier
advance, as the nation prepares to sell more than 3 billion
euros ($4.2 billion) of debt tomorrow.  Ireland’s downgrade “puts the focus back on the euro
crisis as a whole,” said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income
strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “Politicians in
Italy and  Spain  are trying to reassure investors that they are
working hard to get their public finances in order. There is no
quick fix.”  Irish 10-year yields increased 58 basis points to 13.93
percent as of 4:31 p.m. in  London , after touching 14 percent, a
euro-era record. The 5 percent security due October 2020 fell
1.99, or 19.9 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,417) face amount, to
55.015. Two-year Irish note yields climbed 243 basis points to a
record 20.17 percent.  The yield difference, or spread, between Irish 10-year
bonds and similar maturity benchmark German bunds widened to a
record 11.23 percentage points.  ‘Extreme Volatility’  German 10-year bund yields climbed three basis points to
2.74 percent as the nation sold 3.314 billion euros of the
securities. The 3.25 percent 10-year bonds were sold at an
average yield of 2.70 percent, the Bundesbank said, down from an
average yield of 2.96 percent at the last sale of the bonds in
June. Investors bid for 1.2 times the amount of securities on
offer, down from a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.6 at the previous
sale.  “The bid-to-cover of 1.2 is on the weakish side,” said
Norbert Aul, a European rates strategist at  RBC Capital Markets 
said in London, “You have seen extreme market volatility in
German paper and that doesn’t attract investors.”  Ten-year bund yields slid as low as 2.50 percent yesterday,
the least since November, as European finance ministers failed
to present a solution to contain the region’s debt woes. Bonds
from Italy and Spain slumped yesterday amid concern the debt
crisis is spreading, before recovering amid speculation central
banks bought securities to stabilize the market.  Italian Auction  The euro gained against the dollar for the first day in
four, while Treasuries declined amid renewed demand for higher-
yielding assets.  Italy plans to sell up to 1.25 billion euros of 3.75
percent securities maturing in 2016, up to 1.75 billion euros of
4.5 percent 2026 debt and an unspecified amount of 2017 and 2023
bonds tomorrow.  The nation’s finance minister Guilio Tremonti told a
banking forum in  Rome  that part of Italy’s austerity plan will
be bolstered and passed by parliament by the end of July 15.  “The ability to fund oneself is the big issue right now,”
said  Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-rate strategy at
Credit Agricole CIB. “The Italian auction tomorrow is very
important. Italy has to issue huge amounts, so that’s something
the market will be watching.”  Italian 10-year yields were two basis points lower at 5.55
percent, while equivalent-maturity Spanish debt yielded 5.82
percent, three basis points less than the previous close.  Credit-Default Swaps  Kokusai Global Sovereign Open,  Asia ’s biggest debt fund, is
sticking with its bets on Italian bonds, according to Masataka Horii, head of the management team. Italian securities make up
13.7 percent of the $30.3 billion fund’s assets, compared with
7.2 percent in the benchmark it uses to gauge performance, the
Citigroup World Government Bond Index, he said.  The Italian-German spread narrowed six basis points to 2.80
percentage points.  Credit-default swaps insuring Irish bonds climbed one basis
point to 1,000, signaling a 58 percent chance of the government
failing to pay in the next five years, while contracts on  Greece 
fell 25 basis points to 2,265, after earlier rising to a record,
according to CMA. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of
swaps on 15 governments declined 4 basis points to 280.  Irish Downgrade  The Irish government criticized the Moody’s downgrade,
Dublin-based broadcaster RTE reported, citing a finance ministry
spokesman. The country has met the targets so far under its
bailout program, the spokesman said.  Spain’s Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said the nation may
need to endure even deeper spending cuts in 2012 than those
currently planned.  “There’s no fundamental change in  market sentiment  because
the uncertainty remains high,”  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich, said of Italian and
Spanish debt. “There are some investors who are required to get
rid of bonds if they are rated junk, so there will be some
selling of Irish bonds.”  Portugal ’s 10-year bonds fell, pushing the yield up 14
basis points to 12.56 percent, while Greece’s 10-year yields
climbed 19 basis points to 16.98 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors 2.1 percent this
year, compared with a 3.8 percent return for U.S. Treasuries and
3.7 percent for U.K. gilts, indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies show.
Irish bonds have lost almost 19 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
