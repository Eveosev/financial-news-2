British Open organizers are honoring
the memory of former champion Seve Ballesteros this week at
Royal St. George’s.  Ballesteros,  Europe ’s most successful golfer, died in May
at the age of 54 after a 2 1/2-year battle with a brain tumor.
He was the Open champion in 1979, 1984 and 1988.  Players have signed a book of remembrance, which will be
given to Ballesteros’s family. Among the other tributes around
the Sandwich, England, course are his image on the daily
program, an article in the official program, and his silhouette
on the grandstands at the 18th green.  “We think that will just remind everyone as to what a
great man he was and his connection with the Open,” Peter Dawson, chief executive officer of the Royal and Ancient Golf
Club of St. Andrew’s, said at a news conference.  In addition to his three Open championships, Ballesteros
won the  Masters Tournament  twice and captured 87 titles
worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
