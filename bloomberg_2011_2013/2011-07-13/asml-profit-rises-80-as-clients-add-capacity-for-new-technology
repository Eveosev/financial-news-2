ASML Holding NV (ASML) ,  Europe ’s biggest
semiconductor-equipment maker, said second-quarter profit rose
more than 80 percent as chip manufacturers added capacity and
shifted to more advanced-technology machines.  Net income climbed to 432 million euros ($604 million) from
239 million euros a year earlier. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion
euros from 1.07 billion euros. Profit had been seen at 411.6
million euros on sales of 1.5 billion euros, according to the
average estimate of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  ASML said it’s sticking to a forecast for 2011 revenue
“clearly above” 5 billion euros.  “Our second quarter sales came in at record level, keeping
us on track for another record year,” Chief Executive Officer
Eric Meurice said in a statement today.  The Veldhoven, Netherlands-based company booked orders
worth 840 million euros in the second quarter. The company had
previously predicted second-quarter order intake of between 900
million euros and 1 billion euros.  “Customers have become more hesitant,” Chief Financial
Officer Peter Wennink said on the company’s website.  Third-quarter orders “are likely not to exceed 500 million
euros,” the company said. ASML expects sales of around 1.4
billion euros in the current quarter.  Global semiconductor revenue will grow 5.1 percent this
year to $315 billion with “residual effects” from the  Japan 
earthquake in the third quarter, market researcher Gartner Inc.
said June 21. Previously, Gartner had predicted a rise of 6.2
percent this year.  ASML is the world’s largest maker of machines to project
lines on the silicon slices from which chips are made. Its main
rival is Japan’s  Nikon Corp. (7731)   Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) , based in
 Santa Clara , California, is the world’s largest maker of
semiconductor equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
