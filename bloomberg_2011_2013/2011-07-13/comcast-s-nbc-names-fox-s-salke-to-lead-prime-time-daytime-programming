Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC named Jennifer Salke president of its entertainment division, tapping a Fox

of last place among viewers.  Salke will be responsible for prime-time and daytime
programming and oversee casting, Los Angeles-based NBC said
today in an e-mailed statement. She will report to NBC
Entertainment Chairman  Robert Greenblatt .  NBC is developing stronger ties with Twentieth Century Fox
Television, where Salke helped create “Modern Family” and
“Glee,” Greenblatt said. She also helped produce “The Playboy
Club” and “Awake,” shows from the  News Corp (NWSA) .-owned TV studio
that NBC ordered for next season.  “This is truly a significant moment for NBC as we continue
to rebuild the network from top to bottom and put together the
best possible team,” Greenblatt, who joined NBC in January from
CBS Corp.’s Showtime, said in the statement.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, fell 5 cents to $24.57 at 4
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Shares of the
company, the largest U.S. cable TV service, have gained 12
percent this year.  Salke also briefly worked at Sony Corp.’s television
