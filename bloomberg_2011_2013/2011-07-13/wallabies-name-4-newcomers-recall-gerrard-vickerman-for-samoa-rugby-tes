Australia rugby selectors named four
newcomers and recalled Mark Gerrard and Dan Vickerman for the
season-opening Test against Samoa on July 17.  Melbourne Rebels scrum-half Nick Phipps and New South Wales
Waratahs lock Sitaleki Timani were picked in the starting 15,
while fellow rookies James Hanson and flanker Beau Robinson were
chosen on the reserves’ bench.  Gerrard was selected at full-back for his first Test since
the 2007 Rugby  World Cup . Second-rower Vickerman, who took three
years out of professional rugby to study at the U.K.’s Cambridge
University, was named on the bench.  Wallabies captain Rocky Elsom will start at blindside
flanker for his second appearance at any level this year
following hamstring and ankle injuries. Pat McCabe was named at
inside center as coach Robbie Deans assesses his midfield
options before choosing a 30-man squad for this year’s World
Cup. McCabe will have ACT Brumbies teammates  Matt Giteau  and
Adam Ashley-Cooper either side of him.  James Horwill and Quade Cooper were among the Queensland
Reds players rested after the team won the Super Rugby title
four days ago.  AUSTRALIA: Mark Gerrard,  James O’Connor , Adam Ashley-
