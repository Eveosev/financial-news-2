South Africa ’s rand will weaken to 7
per dollar by the end of the year, Morgan Stanley said, changing
its estimate from a previous forecast of 7.50 rand per dollar.  The country’s inflation rate will reach 6 percent in
December and not September as Morgan Stanley had previously
estimated, according to an e-mailed note today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
