The  International Energy Agency 
believes it’s still “too early” to decide on another oil
release and will assess the market next week,  David Fyfe , head
of the agency’s oil industry and markets division, said.  The agency is likely to make a decision on potential action
on about July 23, a month after it announced a 60-million barrel
release of emergency stockpiles, he said today on a conference
call with journalists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
