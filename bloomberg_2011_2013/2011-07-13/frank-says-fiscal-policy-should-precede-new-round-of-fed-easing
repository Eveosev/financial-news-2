Representative  Barney Frank , the
senior Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said
he would like to see more fiscal support for the economy before
the Federal Reserve begins a new program to purchase bonds.  A third round of quantitative easing by the Fed is “not my
first choice,” Frank, a Democrat from  Massachusetts , said in a
Bloomberg Television interview.  “My first choice would be for the Congress to act in a
reasonable way,” he said. “For example, let’s provide some
money in the short-term to cities and towns so they can undo
some of those cuts.”  Frank said critics of the Fed’s more than $2 trillion bond
purchase program “have absolutely been proven wrong” when they
warned it would cause inflation.  “So if we needed a third round, I would be for it,” Frank
said. “I would hope, however, and I think we have done enough
with monetary policy, fiscal policy should come first.”  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  delivered his
semi-annual testimony before the House Financial Services
Committee today. The testimony resumes tomorrow at 10 a.m.
before the Senate Banking Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
