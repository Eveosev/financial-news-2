The  Federal Reserve  will play a role
in supervising and enforcing consumer regulations, even as many
of its duties are shifted to the new Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, said Sandra Braunstein , director of the
Fed’s consumer and community affairs division.  “The Federal Reserve remains committed to carrying out its
responsibilities for consumer protection, which will remain a
priority for the Board notwithstanding the upcoming transfer of
various rule-writing authorities to the Bureau,” Braunstein
said in remarks prepared for testimony today to a  House
Financial Services  subcommittee.  Braunstein’s testimony provided a summary of the Fed’s
mortgage rulemakings from 2008 to 2011 and noted that five rules
the Fed hasn’t finalized will be completed by the consumer
bureau, after the bureau receives authority for mortgage
regulations on July 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
