China’s stocks rebounded from the
biggest drop in seven weeks after the economy grew at a
“moderate pace” last quarter, easing concerns the central bank
will keep raising  interest rates  to tame inflation.  Jiangxi Copper Co., the nation’s biggest producer of the
metal, surged as much as 2.5 percent after China’s economic
growth exceeded estimates.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  and
Shenzhen Development Bank Co. led an advance for financial
stocks after forecasting higher profit. Zijin Mining Group Co.,
China’s largest gold producer, rose to the highest level since
April as spot bullion jumped to an all-time high.  “The data suggest  China’s economy  is growing at a moderate
pace but still pretty healthy,” said  Zhang Ling , general manager
at  Shanghai  River Fund Management Co. “We’ll focus on inflation
figures going forward. If that’s brought under control, growth
will pick up again and that’ll be positive for stocks.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, climbed 14.5 points, or 0.5 percent, to
2,769.06 at 10:16 a.m. local time. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  advanced
0.6 percent to 3,074.21, led by material and energy stocks.  China’s gross domestic product expanded 9.5 percent from a
year earlier, the statistics bureau said in Beijing today, after
a 9.7 percent gain in the first quarter. That compared with the
median 9.3 percent estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 18
economists. Industrial production rose a more-than-estimated
15.1 percent in June, the agency said.  “Slower growth would soften inflation pressures,”  Ken
Peng , senior economist for China at BNP Paribas SA, said before
the report. The Shanghai gauge has fallen 1.6 percent this year
on speculation the economy may be headed for a so-called hard
landing after the central bank raised interest rates five times
and the reserve-requirement ratio 12 times since the start of
2010 to tame inflation that reached a three-year high last month.  Material Stocks  Jiangxi Copper gained for the first time in five days,
rising 1.8 percent to 35.52 yuan.  Yunnan Copper Industry Co. (000878) 
rose 1.8 percent to 22.25 yuan. The metal for September delivery
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 1.1 percent to 71,900 yuan
($11,132) a ton. China Shenhua Energy Co., the largest coal
producer, surged 1.3 percent to 30.14 yuan.  Spot gold jumped to an all-time high in Shanghai as
investors sought to protect their wealth on concern the
escalating debt crisis in  Europe  may trigger a global slowdown.  Zijin Mining rose 3.5 percent to 5.40 yuan. Zhongjin Gold
Corp., the second biggest, added 4.3 percent to 29.03 yuan.  Agricultural Bank of China, the nation’s fourth largest by
assets, added 0.8 percent to 2.68 yuan after it estimated net
income for the first six months of the year may have risen more
than 45 percent from a year earlier.  Shenzhen Development Bank
Co. (000001)  gained 1.6 percent to 17.27 yuan after saying first-half net
income may have risen between 50 percent and 60 percent to as
much as 4.85 billion yuan.  Inflation Outlook  The Shanghai gauge fell the most in seven weeks yesterday
on speculation a European debt crisis may spread and higher-
than-estimated new loans and money supply will make it difficult
for the government to ease its tightening policies.  China may not have conditions for loosening in its monetary
policy currently, the Economic Information Daily reported today,
citing Ba Shusong, a researcher at the State Council’s
Development Research Center.  Pork prices in China may remain at a high level until April
of next year as the amount of the meat in stock is limited, the
21st Century Business Herald reported, citing Liu Tong, director
of the Xinfadi market in Beijing.  Ireland Cut  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.4 percent in  New
York  yesterday after the downgrading of Ireland’s credit rating
to junk added to concerns Europe is losing control of the credit
crisis and overshadowed evidence the  Federal Reserve  hasn’t
ruled out more stimulus.  Ireland’s credit rating was cut to Ba1, non-investment
grade, from Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Service, joining  Portugal 
and  Greece  to become the third euro-area country to be lowered
to junk. The outlook remains negative. Portugal’s rating was cut
four levels to Ba2 on July 5 by Moody’s. The European Union is
 China ’s biggest export market, accounting for about a fifth of
the Asian nation’s overseas shipments.  BYD Co., the Chinese automaker part-owned by  Warren
Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway, declined 1.9 percent to 30.92 yuan.
The company said first-half profit fell as much as 95 percent
after sales fell because of the end of preferential taxes for
small cars.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Shiyin Chen  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
