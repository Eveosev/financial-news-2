Goalkeepers tend to dive right when
their soccer team is trailing in a World Cup penalty shootout,
according to a study to be published in the Psychological
Science journal.  Researchers at the University of Amsterdam examined every
penalty shootout at the four-yearly championship from 1982 to
2010 and found that most of the time, goalkeepers are equally
likely to dive right and left. When the goalie’s team was behind,
he was more likely to go right, the study showed.  “Even in this really important situation, people are still
influenced by biological factors,” Marieke Roskes, who co-wrote
the study, said in an e-mailed statement.  The pattern follows findings that people and animals tend
to favor the right side if they want something, the report said.
When dogs see their owners, they wag their tails more to the
right; toads strike to the right when going for prey; and humans
are more likely to turn their heads to the right to kiss their
partner.  In an experiment, the University of Amsterdam research team
found that people who are told to divide a line in half tend to
aim a bit to the right when they are both thinking about a
positive goal and under time pressure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
