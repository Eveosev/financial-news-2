Georgia said a photographer detained
on suspicion of espionage has links to two Russians expelled for
spying five years ago.  Zurab Qurtsikidze from the European Pressphoto Agency was
arrested July 7 along with presidential photographer Irakli
Gedenidze, Gedenidze’s wife Natia, and Foreign Ministry
photographer Giorgi Abdaladze. A court in Tbilisi ordered July 9
that Qurtsikidze, Gedenidze and Abdaladze be held for two months
while they await trial. Natia Gedenidze was released on bail.  “Qurtsikidze has links to the spy scandal members from
2006,” Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili told reporters today
in Tbilisi. “He is suspected of having made phone and possibly
other contact since 2004 and we have enough evidence.”  Police say the photographers passed confidential
information about President Mikheil Saakashvili through
Qurtsikidze to Russian secret services. Abdaladze said July 11
that they were targeted because they sold pictures of anti-
government protests in May at which a demonstrator was killed by
riot police.  Qurtsikidze had ties to Anatoly Sinitsin and Sergey
Okrokov, who were arrested on suspicion of spying and sent back
to  Russia  in 2006, Merabishvili said. Russia won a five-day war
with Georgia two year later.  The photographers’ arrests have no connection to May’s
protests, Merabishvili added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
