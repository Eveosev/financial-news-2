ASML Holding NV (ASML)  fell in Amsterdam
trading after  Europe ’s biggest semiconductor-equipment maker
forecast third-quarter orders won’t exceed 500 million euros
($700 million).  Veldhoven, Netherlands-based ASML dropped 8.3 percent to
23.58 euros as of 9:02 a.m. local time.  “Our customers are currently taking some time to assess the
semiconductor end-demand trends for 2012 before determining
their overall capacity plans levels and timings,’’ Chief
Executive Officer Eric Meurice said today in a statement.  ASML’s second-quarter net income beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
