Glencore International Plc, the
commodities trader reported to have studied a bid for Eurasian
Natural Resources Corp., would struggle to acquire the company
because of its ownership structure, Citigroup Inc. said today.  “You’ve got cross-ownership there,”  Heath Jansen , an
analyst at Citigroup, told reporters in London, saying that
Glencore would have to contend with shareholders  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) ,
which holds a 26 percent stake, and the Kazakh government, with
12 percent. “It’s not an easy transaction to really pull off.”  The London-based Sunday Times reported June 12 that
Glencore was studying a 12 billion-pound ($19 billion) takeover
offer for ENRC and had held talks with shareholders. Glencore
responded in a June 15 statement, saying it’s “not in active
consideration of an offer.”  Following the announcement, the U.K. Takeover Panel barred
Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore from bidding for ENRC for six
months.  “It’s probably a longer-term duration; it will be a big
deal for anyone to do,” Jansen said, adding that London-based
ENRC would be a “strong fit” for Glencore because of its
ferrochrome,  iron ore  and aluminum assets.  ENRC’s Kazakh founders, Alexander Machkevitch, Alijan Ibragimov and Patokh Chodiev, own 15 percent each in the
company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
