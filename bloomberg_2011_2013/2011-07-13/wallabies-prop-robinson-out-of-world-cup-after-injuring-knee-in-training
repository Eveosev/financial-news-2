Australia  prop Benn Robinson was
ruled out for the rest of the season after injuring his knee in
training yesterday, keeping him out of the Rugby World Cup.  An arthroscopy revealed that Robinson, 26, tore the
anterior cruciate ligament and damaged a meniscus in his right
knee after stumbling at training yesterday, the Australian Rugby
Union said in a statement.  Robinson, who’s played 42 Tests for the Wallabies, will
have surgery in the coming days and his recovery time will
curtail the rest of his season, the Sydney-based ARU said.  “It’s disappointing news for Benn, disappointing news for
the rest of the squad and for Australian rugby as a whole,”
Wallabies coach Robbie Deans said in the statement.  Pek Cowan or Al Baxter will take Robinson’s place in
Australia’s 40-man squad. Deans is scheduled to name his 30-man
roster for the Sept. 9-Oct. 23  World Cup  in  New Zealand  on Aug.
