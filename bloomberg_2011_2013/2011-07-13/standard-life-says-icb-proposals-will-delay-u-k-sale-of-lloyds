The  Independent Commission on
Banking ’s proposal that  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  should increase
asset disposals will delay the sale of the government’s stake,
according to  Standard Life Plc (SL/) , an investor in the bank.  “The uncertainty created by these proposals has reduced
the value of Lloyds Banking Group and will inevitably delay the
sale” of the government’s holding, wrote Jonathan Cobb,
Standard Life governance and stewardship director in a
submission to the ICB published on its website today. “In
short, the ICB proposals make little sense to us.”  Lloyds is selling 632 branches to comply with a European
Union ruling on taxpayer aid. The ICB said in its April interim
report that 41 percent taxpayer-owned Lloyds should sell
“substantially” more assets. The bank has received bids for
the branches from Virgin Money Holdings U.K. Ltd., NBNK
Investments Plc and Co-Operative Bank Plc, a person with
knowledge of the sales process said yesterday.  John Vickers , 53, the Oxford University academic chairing
the commission, was asked by the government last year to make
recommendations to boost stability and competition in the
British banking industry. The ICB will hand the final report to
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Business
Secretary Vince Cable on September 12.  Edinburgh-based Standard Life holds at least 1 percent of
Lloyds, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
