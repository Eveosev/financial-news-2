Slovakia is on track to meet its
 budget-deficit  target this year with expenditure overruns being
offset by savings in other areas, Finance Minister Ivan Miklos
said.  Unplanned expenditures such as the costs of a state-
railways overhaul and expected uncollected revenue may amount to
460 million euros ($647 million), according to a Finance
Ministry document discussed by the Cabinet today. The shortfall
should be offset by savings in other spending areas, Miklos said
at a press conference in Slovak capital, Bratislava.  Slovakiaâ€™s budget deficit swelled in 2009 when the country
experienced a recession, prompting the government to cut
spending and raise indirect taxes to stabilize public finances.
The eastern European country aims to narrow the budget shortfall
to 4.9 percent of economic output from 7.8 percent in 2010.  The central budget deficit reached 1.58 billion euros as of
June 30, representing 41 percent of the full-year target of 3.8
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
