Gold climbed to within 0.2 percent
of a record in London as concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis
spurred demand for the metal as a protection of wealth. Bullion
rose to an all-time high in British pounds.  Ireland joined  Portugal  and  Greece  yesterday as the third
euro-area nation to have its  credit rating  cut to below
investment grade, sending the metal in euros to the highest-ever
levels. The cost of insuring debt from Italy,  Spain  and Portugal
climbed to records this week.  “With European sovereign debt fears intensifying again,
little clarity on what euro-zone officials intend to do next,”
gold is benefiting,  Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at UBS
AG, said in a report today. “This should, in theory, be gold’s
time to shine as a safe haven and as an alternative currency.”  Immediate-delivery gold gained as much as $7.48, or 0.5
percent, to $1,575.18 an ounce, the highest price since the May
2 record of $1,577.57. It was little changed at $1,569.75 by
11:18 a.m. in  London . Gold for August delivery was 0.5 percent
higher at $1,570.60 an ounce on the Comex in  New York .  Bullion rose to $1,571.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,550.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. An
eighth daily advance today would be the best winning run since
the nine days of gains to April 25.  Gold is up 10 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades.
Europe’s debt crisis helped bullion reach a record two months
ago. The metal reached a record 987.59 pounds an ounce today.  ‘Negative’ Outlook  Moody’s Investors Service lowered Ireland to Ba1 from Baa3
yesterday, citing the probability the country will require
additional official financing. The outlook remains “negative,”
Moody’s said. The euro yesterday slid to a four-month low versus
the dollar as European finance ministers failed to present a
solution to the financial contagion that’s threatening to spread
to  Italy  from Greece, Ireland and Portugal.  “Gold can easily reach $1,600 in the next one or two
months as the debt crisis in Europe worsens,” Li Fang, an
analyst at Zhonghui Futures Co., said from Shanxi. “Gold is
trading at elevated levels even though we are in a weak demand
season. When physical buyers come back in the fourth quarter, we
fully expect prices to push even higher.”  UBS raised its one-month gold forecast to $1,575 from
$1,475 and kept its three-month estimate at $1,600.  Record investment demand for gold in  India  will keep
climbing as higher incomes spur buying even with the metal
trading near an all-time high, according to Reliance Capital
Asset Management Ltd., which operates the second-biggest gold-
backed fund in the world’s largest consumer.  Silver for immediate delivery rose 1.2 percent to $36.53 an
ounce in London. Palladium gained 0.9 percent to $772.50 an
ounce. Platinum was up 0.6 percent at $1,741.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
