Sam Ghosh, Chief Executive Officer
at Reliance Capital Ltd., the financial services company
controlled by billionaire  Anil Ambani , comments on the outlook
for Indian equities after three bomb blasts hit  Mumbai  killing
at least 10 people.  The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or
Sensex, rose 1 percent to 18,596.02 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, halting a three-day decline. The explosions occured at
about 7 p.m., according to the police.  “We may see a panic reaction tomorrow in the markets, but
I don’t foresee any weakening of long-term sentiments on account
of the blasts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
