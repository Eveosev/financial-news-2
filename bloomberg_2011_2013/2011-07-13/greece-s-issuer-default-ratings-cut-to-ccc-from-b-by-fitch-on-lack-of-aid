Greece  had its long-term foreign and
local currency issuer default ratings cut to CCC from B+ by
Fitch Ratings because of the lack of an aid program for the
debt-laden country.  The country’s short-term foreign currency issuer default
rating was also cut, to C from B.  The downgrade reflects the absence of a new, fully-funded
and credible program for Greece by the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund , Fitch said. That’s coupled with
more uncertainty surrounding the role of private creditors in
any future funding, as well as Greece’s weakening macroeconomic
outlook, Fitch said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
