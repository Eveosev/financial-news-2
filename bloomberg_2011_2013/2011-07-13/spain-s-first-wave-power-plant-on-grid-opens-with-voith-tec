Spain ’s first grid-connected wave
power project has been commissioned by  Ente Vasco de Energia ,
energy agency of the northern Basque region.  The 2.3 million-euro ($3.3 million) project in Mutriku was
developed by the agency using funds from the regional government
and technology from a  Siemens AG (SIE)  and Voith GmbH venture, Jose
Ramon Epelde, an EVE spokesman, said by e-mail today. The 296-
kilowatt plant, which began operating last week, is continental
 Europe ’s first to supply power to users on the grid, he said.  Spain, along with the U.K., is seeking to harness energy
from waves and tides along its Atlantic coastline. A total of 26
marine energy projects are being developed in the country with a
combined value of 236 million euros, Spanish renewable energy
lobby Asociacion de Productores de Energias Renovables says.
Spain plans 100 megawatts in marine energy capacity by 2020.  The Mutriku plant uses oscillating water column technology,
in which turbines are attached to a breakwater to generate power
as air is pressurized and de-pressurized by waves. Voith Hydro,
a venture between Voith and Siemens, provided the 16 turbines.  The commercial plant will generate enough energy to power
250 average homes, it said in a statement. Voith Hydro operates
smaller plants with the technology in Scotland and  Portugal .  The European Commission provided 200,000 euros for the
Mutriku project under its so-called sixth framework program for
research and technological development, Epelde said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
