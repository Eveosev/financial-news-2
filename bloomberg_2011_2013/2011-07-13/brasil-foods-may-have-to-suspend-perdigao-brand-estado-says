BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3)  will likely be
ordered to suspend the use of its Perdigao and Batavo brands as
a condition for final approval of its acquisition of Sadia SA,  O
Estado de S. Paulo  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Brasil Foods  likely won’t be allowed to use the Perdigao
and Batavo brands for two to five years, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said. Representatives of the company and  Brazil ’s
antitrust regulator were still negotiating the accord last night
and had reached an agreement on 95 percent of the issues, the
newspaper said.  The purchase of Sadia will be voted on today by Brazil’s
antitrust regulator, known as Cade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
