Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s credit
investment unit, GSO Capital Partners LP, is in talks to acquire
a 160 million-pound ($256 million) stake in the U.K.’s largest
privately held homebuilder, according to three people with
knowledge of the matter.  GSO is negotiating the purchase of an equity stake in
Edinburgh-based Miller Group Ltd. as part of a refinancing of
debt due in 2012, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the discussions are private.  Miller has hired Greenhill & Co. as an adviser, two of the
people said.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , 43 percent-owned by the U.K.
government, owns a 20 percent stake in Miller, which the bank
acquired as part of its purchase of HBOS Plc in 2009. HBOS
bought the stake in 2007, anticipating that demand for new
housing would outstrip supply until at least 2020.  The talks were reported earlier today by U.K. newspaper the
 Daily Telegraph .  To contact the reporter on this story:
