Jetstar Airways Pty Ltd. , the budget
unit of  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) , plans to add a daily service
between Melbourne and Beijing later this year to tap rising
travel demand in China.  Beijing will be the low-cost carrier’s ninth Chinese
destination amid a recent route expansion in the country, the
Melbourne-based company said in a statement today. The service
is due to open Nov. 24 and will have capacity for 8,000
passengers a week, the statement said.  The expansion is part of Jetstar’s move to tap China’s
middle class, which may increase to 300 million in five years,
Jetstar Chief Executive Officer  Bruce Buchanan  said at a Beijing
news conference. Melbourne saw 27 percent more Chinese citizen
arrivals in the last year, the company said in  a separate
statement  on its website.  Jetstar plans to have as many as 12 routes to  China  by the
end of the year, Buchanan said.  The airline said last week that it would offer flights to
the city of Ningbo in China’s coastal Zhejiang province. Its
current Chinese destinations also include Haikou, Shantou,
Guilin and Hangzhou.  Jetstar will use the 310-seat  Airbus A330  on the Beijing-
Melbourne route, the website statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
