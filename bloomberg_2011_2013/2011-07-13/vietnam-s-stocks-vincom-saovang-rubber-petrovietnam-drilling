Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Vietnam  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, gained 0.2 percent to 418.18.  Vincom Joint-Stock Co. (VIC VN), Vietnam’s largest listed
real-estate company by market value, fell 3.1 percent to 126,000
dong, the lowest since June 22. The company raised $40 million
from a 6-percent, 11-month convertible loan that was arranged by
Credit Suisse Group AG’s Singapore branch, according to a
statement on its website.  Saovang Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (SRC VN), which manufactures
tires for automobiles, motorcycles and bicycles, climbed 4.6
percent to 15,800 dong, the most since June 1.  Rubber increased, snapping a four-day losing streak, as
investors bought back yen-based contracts after the Japanese
currency retreated from a four-month high against the dollar
amid speculation over intervention.  PetroVietnam Drilling & Well Services Joint-Stock Co. (PVD
VN), dropped 1.2 percent to 39,700 dong. Oil declined from a
three-day high in  New York  as investors bet that increasing U.S.
crude supplies and  Europe ’s spreading debt crisis signaled
demand for raw materials may falter.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
