Nigerian labor unions will go on a
three-day “warning strike” from July 20 to demand the payment
of the new 18,000-naira ($118)  minimum wage , the leader of the
country’s biggest labor group said.  “There will be no work, no flights and people should take
those three days as holidays and stay at home,” Owei Lakemfa,
secretary-general of the  Nigerian Labour Congress , said by phone
today from Abuja, the capital.  President Goodluck Jonathan in March signed into law
legislation that raised the monthly minimum wage from 9,500
naira. The unions say workers haven’t received the new salary.  Unions are prepared to call an indefinite strike if the new
wage structure is not implemented after the warning action,
Lakemfa said.  “In that case, government will either break us, or we will
break their will,” he said. “It is ironic that citizens have
to force governments to obey the law.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
