Henniges Automotive Holdings, the
manufacturer of sealing systems to the car and truck market, set
the initial rate on a $135 million term loan B it’s seeking to
refinance debt and pay a dividend, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CS)  is arranging the six-year debt with
an interest rate of 6 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate with a lower limit of 1.5 percent for the
lending benchmark, said the person, who decline to be identified
because the terms are private.  Farmington Mills,  Michigan  based Henniges may sell the debt
at 99 cents on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds
for the borrower and boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders will get one year of 101 soft-call protection,
meaning that Henniges would have to pay one cent more than face
value to refinance the loan in its first year, the person said.  The company is also seeking a $20 million revolving line of
credit maturing in five years, the person said.  Macquarie Group Ltd. and PNC Capital Markets LLC are
helping arrange the loans.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid. In a  term loan , it can’t. A term loan B is
mainly bought by non-bank lenders such as collateralized loan
obligations, mutual funds and  hedge funds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
