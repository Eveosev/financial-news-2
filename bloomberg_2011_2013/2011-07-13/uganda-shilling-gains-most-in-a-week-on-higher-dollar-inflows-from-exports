Uganda ’s shilling appreciated the
most in more than a week against the dollar as inflows of the
U.S. currency from sales of exports and from aid increased.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
gained for a second day, adding 0.6 percent, the biggest
intraday jump since July 4, to 2,587.50 per dollar by 1:01 p.m.
in the capital, Kampala.  “The dollar inflows have been good today, coming from the
non-governmental organization sector and a bit from the export
sector,” Faisal Bukenya, a currency trader at the local unit of
Barclays Bank Plc, said by phone from Kampala, without providing
further details. “There is little demand for the dollar as
currently buyers because buyers think the shilling may
appreciate.”  The central bank has sold dollars in the domestic foreign-
exchange market at least four times since June 15 as the
currency slumped to its weakest level since 1993 on June 30,
making it the third-worst performer worldwide after Suriname’s
dollar and Maldives’ rufiyaa. Inflation in the East African
country accelerated to a 17-year high of 16 percent in May,
before slowing to 15.8 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
