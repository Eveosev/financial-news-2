Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Taiwan  trading. Stock symbols are in

to 8,488.06 at 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei  Memory-chip makers:  Nanya Technology Corp. (2408)  (2408 TT)
dropped 4.6 percent to NT$7.23 and  Inotera Memories Inc. (3474)  (3474
TT) lost 5.3 percent to NT$7.65. UBS AG said in a report it
expects memory-chip prices to fall 17 percent in the third
quarter from the previous three months. That’s more than the 10
to 15 percent decline it estimated two weeks ago.  E Ink Holdings Inc. (8069)  (8069 TT), a supplier to Amazon.com
Inc., jumped 6 percent to NT$54.60, the biggest advance since
April 29. Investors are speculating that shipments of Amazon’s
tablet computer may rise to a million units in the third quarter
from earlier estimates of 800,000 units, the Economic Daily News
reported today, without citing anyone.  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT) retreated 4.9 percent to NT$870, the
lowest close since Jan. 14 and a second day of declines.  Asia ’s
second-largest maker of smartphones lost 6.9 percent yesterday
after it was accused of infringing Apple Inc. patents in a case
that may halt U.S. imports of the Taiwanese company’s products.
HTC continues to “vehemently deny” all of Apple’s past and
present claims against it , said Grace Lei, its general counsel.  UBS AG said it sees “downside impact” to HTC’s earnings
from declining European handset demand, analyst Arthur Hsieh
said in a report dated yesterday. He maintained the stock’s
rating at “buy.”  MediaTek Inc. (2454)  (2454 TT), Taiwan’s largest chip designer,
sank 5.7 percent to NT$247 after a U.S. trade agency agreed to
investigate claims made by Freescale Semiconductor Inc. that
Mediatek, Funai Electric Co. and Zoran Corp. infringed a patent
for chip technology used in televisions. “We don’t see any
impact on our operations,” Sharon Lo, a spokeswoman for the
Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said by phone yesterday.  Simplo Technology Co. (6121 TT) surged 6.4 percent to
NT$265.50, rebounding from yesterday’s 4 percent slump, the
steepest in four months. Investors are buying the shares
following yesterday’s decline amid optimism over the company’s
earnings as it has orders for Intel Corp.’s ultrabooks, said
Dennis Chan, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co.  Intel has said it aims to convert 40 percent of consumer
laptops to thinner ones by the end of the 2012. Ting Hei-min, a
spokeswoman for Simplo, said it’s too early to discuss orders
for Intel’s ultrabooks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
