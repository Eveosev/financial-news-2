Former executives of  Empresas La
Polar SA (LAPOLAR) , the Chilean retailer that engaged in irregular
consumer-loan practices, will be charged by the local securities
regulator with providing false information and insider trading.  Ex-chief executive officers Pablo Alcalde and Nicolas Ramirez have 10 working days to respond to the charges that may
lead to sanctions including fines, Fernando Coloma,  Chile ’s
chief securities regulator, told reporters in Santiago today.  La Polar said last month that executives restructured 475
billion pesos ($1 billion) of overdue credit without getting the
consent of the more than 400,000 customers involved, triggering
regulatory and criminal probes. A unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP will be asked to respond to charges of contravening Chile’s
auditing regulations, Coloma said.  “Regulators will continue investigating the events and
situations related to the La Polar case that may involve other
people and institutions,” said Coloma, who heads the regulatory
agency known as the SVS.  Partners in private equity firm Southern Cross Group, Raul Sotomayor and Norberto Morita, are accused of failing in their
legal duties as board members while  Martin Gonzalez , La Polar’s
current interim CEO, is charged with delivering irregular, false
or incomplete information to the market, Coloma said.  Southern Cross Group didn’t immediately respond to an e-
mailed message seeking comment. PricewaterhouseCoopers
executives in Santiago weren’t available to comment, a member of
the firm’s security staff said by telephone after business
hours. La Polar’s external public relations agency doesn’t have
Alcalde’s and Ramirez’s new contact details, an executive said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
