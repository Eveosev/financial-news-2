Shares of  Ivory Coast ’s rubber
and palm oil producers may more than double because of an
expected rise in commodity prices and an economic recovery
in the West African nation, Imara Africa Securities said in
new coverage.  The brokerage rated  Societe Africaine de Plantations
d’Heveas (SPHC)  SA, known as SAPH, Societe des Caouchoucs de
Grand-Bereby SA, known as SOGB, and Palmci SA as “buy”
and set estimates for the share prices of the three
Abidjan-based companies of more than double their current
levels, according to an e-mailed report today by Harare,
Zimbabwe-based analyst, Batanai Matsika. The companies are
listed on the regional BRVM stock exchange in Ivory Coast.  “We strongly believe that these three BRVM-listed
stocks will be winners in turns of returns over the next
two to three years,” Matsika wrote. This is “largely
driven by a bullish outlook on rubber and  palm oil  prices
as well as political stabilization” in Ivory Coast.  Business in Ivory Coast was disrupted late last year
and earlier this year after President Laurent Gbagbo
refused to step down after losing an election and was later
ousted from power. The government has forecast a 6.3
percent economic contraction this year.  SAPH’s price estimate was set at $197.70, or 87,662
 CFA francs , by Imara, a 140 percent gain from yesterday’s
closing price of 36,500 CFA francs. SOGB’s share price may
rise to $177.60, or 78,756 CFA francs, a 129 percent rise
from yesterday’s 34,400 CFA franc close while Palmci’s
price may rise 178 percent to $56.40, or 25,000 CFA francs,
Imara said. The BRVM index has fallen 7 percent this year.  Rubber Prices  SAPH produces rubber while SOGB produces both
commodities and  Palmci (PALC)  produces palm oil.  Rubber prices are likely to rise on growing use in
 China ,  India  and Malaysia. Demand is expected to rise 9.1
percent to 3.6 million metric tons in China next year,
while Indian demand may grow as much as 5 percent to
991,000 metric tons and Malaysian demand could rise 7
percent to 490,000 metric tons, Imara said.  China, India, Malaysia,  Thailand  and  Singapore , who
account for 92 percent of global production, will likely
produce 9.77 million metric tons this year, 4.8 percent
more than in 2010.  Rubber for December delivery traded at 373.20 yen a
kilogram ($4,702 a ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
today and the price of the raw material has fallen 11
percent this year.  While Africa accounts for only about 4 percent of
world rubber production, with half of that coming from the
Ivory Coast, production costs are lower than in  Asia , Imara
said.  Palm Oil  Ivory Coast has about 126,000 hectares (311,000 acres)
of land producing rubber and the government plans to plant
a further 600,000 hectares by 2018 in the form of new land
and new plants on old plantations, Imara said, without
saying where it got the information. Production this year
may rise 5 percent to 238,000 tons.  Palm oil production rose about 5.5 percent in Ivory
Coast last year to 415,900 tons, Imara said.  Palm oil for
September delivery rose 1.6 percent on the  Malaysia 
Derivatives Exchange today to $3,082 ringgit a ton and has
gained 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
