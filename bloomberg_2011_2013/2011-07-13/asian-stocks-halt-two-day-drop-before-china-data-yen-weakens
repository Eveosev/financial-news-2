U.S. stock-index futures fell and
the euro strengthened against the dollar after Moody’s Investors
Service said it may cut the American government’s Aaa credit
rating.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in September
dropped 0.6 percent to 1,303.90 at 5:05 p.m. in  New York . The
euro climbed to $1.4203 from about $1.4167 before the Moody’s
announcement.  Moody’s said it’s reviewing the rating for possible
downgrade because of the “rising possibility” that the debt
limit won’t be raised on a timely basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
