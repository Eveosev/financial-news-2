The Treasury Department’s $21
billion sale of 10-year notes may draw a yield of 2.951 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The auction is the second reopening of the May 11 offering
of $24 billion of the securities, which mature in May 2021. They
yielded 2.945 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1
p.m. New York time.  Last month’s offering of 10-year notes drew a yield of
2.967 percent. The June 8 sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3.23, versus 3 at the May auction and an average of
3.11 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 50.6 percent of the securities
at last month’s auction, compared with 47.2 percent at the May
sale. The average for the past 10 sales is 51.5 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 8.3 percent of the
notes at the June sale, versus 8.4 percent the previous month
and an average of 7.6 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Ten-year notes have returned 5.5 percent this year,
compared with a 3.6 percent gain for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The U.S. sold $32 billion of three-year debt yesterday at a
yield of 0.67 percent. It will sell $13 billion in 30-year
securities tomorrow in the last of this week’s $66 billion of
note and bond offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
