Newcastle midfielder Joey Barton
won’t join his team on its pre-season soccer tour of the U.S.
after being denied a visa, the Premier League club said.  Barton was notified by the U.S. Embassy that he won’t be
granted a visa for for this month’s trip, which includes matches
against Sporting Kansas, Orlando City and Columbus Crew,
Newcastle said in a statement on its website.  He’ll instead join up with Newcastle’s reserve team on its
tour of the Netherlands beginning tomorrow, the club said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
