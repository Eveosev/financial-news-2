The dollar weakened against the
majority of its most-traded counterparts after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank is prepared to
take additional action to boost the  U.S. economy .  The euro gained as the Italian Senate approved an austerity
package aimed at balancing the budget in 2014 and U.S. retail
sales stagnated in June. The greenback fell against higher-
yielding currencies as Bernanke began his second day of
testimony to Congress. New Zealand’s dollar rose to a record
against the dollar after a larger-than-forecast gain in gross
domestic product.  “The dollar is suffering from the overhang from Bernanke’s
offer to do more if necessary,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior
market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group LLC in Greenwich,
 Connecticut . “If you get bad data out of the U.S., that’s for
the time being going to be bad for the dollar under an implicit
assumption that there is another round of easing coming.”  The dollar was 0.2 percent lower at $1.4190 per euro at
10:39 a.m. from $1.4167 yesterday, when it slid 1.4 percent, its
biggest loss since Jan. 13. It fell as low as 78.47 yen, the
least since March 17, before rebounding to trade little changed
at 79.16 yen.  Japan ’s currency weakened 0.4 percent to 112.31
per euro, from 111.86.  Kiwi, Rand  New Zealand’s currency rose 1.2 percent to 84.72 U.S. cents
after reaching 85.07 U.S. cents, the strongest since it was
freely floated in 1985.  New Zealand’s economy expanded 0.8 percent in the three
months ended March 31 from the previous quarter, the government
statistics agency said in Wellington. The central bank forecast
growth of 0.3 percent.  South  Africa ’s rand fell to its lowest level in more than a
week against the euro and declined versus the dollar on concern
strikes by steel, engineering and energy workers will slow
growth in Africa’s biggest economy.  The rand slipped as much as 1.4 percent to 9.7801 per euro,
the weakest level since July 5, before trading at 9.7486.  South
Africa ’s currency retreated 0.8 percent against the dollar to
6.851.  The dollar remained lower after sales at U.S. retailers
stagnated in June, increasing 0.1 percent, according to the
Commerce Department in  Washington .  Fed Update  Bernanke began testimony to U.S. lawmakers today, speaking
before the Senate, after appearing before the House Financial
Services Committee yesterday. The Fed is prepared to take
additional action if the economy appears to be in danger of
stalling, he said yesterday.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six U.S. trading
partners including the euro, yen and pound, slid 0.4 percent to
74.884.  The U.S., rated Aaa by Moody’s since 1917, was put on
review for the first time since 1996 on concern the nation’s
debt threshold will not be raised in time to prevent a missed
payment of interest or principal on outstanding bonds and notes,
even though the risk is low, Moody’s said yesterday.  The euro gained against all but the  New Zealand dollar 
after Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  won a confidence vote in
the Italian  Senate , paving the way for final passage of the plan
tomorrow. The 17-nation currency earlier weakened after Italian
 government bonds  slumped as borrowing costs rose to a three-year
high at a sale of five-year debt.  Gold Rises  Gold rose to a record as concern the Fed may embark on
additional stimulus boosted demand for the metal as a store of
wealth. Immediate-delivery gold rose as much as $11.73, or 0.7
percent, to $1,594.10 an ounce.  The Swiss franc weakened 0.3 percent to 1.1618 per euro
after reaching 1.1495, an all-time high. It also touched a
record 80.83 centimes per  U.S. dollar , before trading little
changed at 81.64.  “Against the backdrop of joint European Union and U.S.
woes, the recent outperformance of the franc, the yen and gold
is understandable and likely to persist,” BNP Paribas SA
strategists including Ray Attrill and Steven Saywell wrote in an
investor report today.  Swiss central bank Vice President Thomas Jordan said policy
makers are “very concerned” about recent currency developments
after the franc appreciated to a record against the euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
