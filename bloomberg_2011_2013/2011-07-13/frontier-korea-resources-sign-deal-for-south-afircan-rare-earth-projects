Frontier Rare Earths Ltd. (FRO)  said it
signed an initial agreement with Korea Resources Corp. to
develop the company’s rare-earths project in  South Africa .  Under the heads of agreement, state-owned Korea Resources
may acquire as much as 20 percent of the Zandkopsdrift rare-
earths project, up to 40 percent of its production and a stake
of as much as 10 percent in Frontier, the company said in a
statement from Toronto today. It gave no financial terms.  A binding agreement with the South Korean company to
develop the project in South Africa’s Northern Cape province,
including financial and technical assistance, is expected in the
fourth quarter, Frontier said. Talks with other potential
partners continue, it said.  “Rare earths are a critical raw material needed to support
 Korea ’s high technology industry and future economic growth,”
Korea Resources Chief Executive Officer Shin-Jong Kim said in
the statement.  Rare earths are used in sonar systems, lasers, flat-screen
televisions and hybrid cars.  #<876750.2844859.2.1.87.23378.96>#  To contact the reporter on this story:
