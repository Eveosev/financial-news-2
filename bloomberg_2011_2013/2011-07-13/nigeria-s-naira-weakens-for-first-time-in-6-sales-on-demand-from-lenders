     July 13 (Bloomberg News) --  Nigeria ’s naira weakened at a
central-bank auction today, snapping five straight increases as
lenders demanded the most foreign currency in five sales.  The marginal rate, which is used as the prevailing exchange
rate, fell to 150.08 per dollar compared with 150 at the
previous sale, the Abuja-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement. The bank sold $250 million, less than the $410
million demanded, the biggest amount sought since the June 27
sale. In the  interbank market , the naira depreciated 0.4 percent
to 152.4 per dollar by 4:08 p.m.  “High  government spending  is putting the naira under
pressure,”  Bismarck Rewane , managing director of Financial
Derivatives Co., a brokerage, said by phone. “Speculative
demand is expected, as dealers can buy at the central-bank
auction at the current low price” while the rate in the black
market is about 162 per dollar, he said.  President  Goodluck Jonathan , who was returned to power in
April elections, slashed almost 500 billion naira ($3.3 billion)
off a budget adopted two months earlier, taking the final
spending plan to 4.5 trillion naira.  The central bank of sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest
economy and largest oil producer has been using foreign-currency
reserves to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band
above or below 150 per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions.  Foreign-currency reserves stood at $31.7 billion by July 4
compared with $37 billion a year earlier, according to central-
bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
