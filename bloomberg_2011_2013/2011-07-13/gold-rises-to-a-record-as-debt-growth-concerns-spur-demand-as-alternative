Gold futures surged to a record
$1,588.90 an ounce as the dollar’s slump and the European debt
crisis spurred demand for precious metals as alternative assets.
Silver surged the most since March 2009.  The greenback fell as much as much as 1 percent against a
six-currency basket after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  told Congress that the central bank is prepared to
provide additional stimulus to bolster the economy. Yesterday,
Ireland became the third nation in the European Union to have
its  credit rating  cut below investment grade.  “The Fed is talking about more liquidity, not less,” said
 Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in  Chicago .
“That’s more money for the markets, and gold is enthused.
Investors are running away from currency volatility.”  Gold futures for August delivery climbed $23.20, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $1,585.50 at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the seventh straight gain. The previous intraday record of
$1,577.40 was on May 2. The spot price of the metal priced in
euros and pounds also rose to all-time highs today.  Since Dec. 1, 2008, gold has doubled as the Fed kept
 interest rates  at a record low and governments spent trillions
of dollars to spur global growth. The Fed’s second round of so-
called quantitative easing, known as QE2 among investors, ended
in June.  Yesterday, tonnage holdings in exchange-traded products
backed by gold jumped 1 percent, the most in a year.  ‘Currency Exhaustion’  “People are getting currency exhaustion,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago. “With the Fed mulling over a possible QE3, which will
dilute the dollar, gold is the main beneficiary.”  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
rose to a four-week high, led by precious metals and grains.  Gold for immediate delivery has advanced 11 percent,
heading for an 11th straight annual gain, the longest rally
since at least 1920.  Before today, the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
rose 1.5 percent in 2011, and Treasuries returned 3.6 percent,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The dollar
had dropped 4.1 percent against the six-currency basket.  ‘Shock Waves’  Bernanke said today that a failure by Congress to raise the
nation’s $14.3 trillion debt limit would lead to a “major
crisis” and throw “shock waves” through the financial system.  “We’re in a very difficult financial period in the
world,” Martin Murenbeeld, the chief economist at Toronto-based
DundeeWealth Inc., which manages more than $50 billion, said on
July 11. “The faith in paper currency is rapidly ebbing.”  Investor holdings of ETPs backed by gold, silver, platinum
and palladium have climbed to more than $126 billion.  Silver futures for September delivery rose $2.517, or 7.1
percent, to $38.151 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest gain
since March 19, 2009.  Platinum futures for October delivery gained $30.70, or 1.8
percent, to $1,767 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $16.55, or 2.2
percent, to $784 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
