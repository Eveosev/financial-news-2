Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress that the high budget deficits in the
U.S., if not curbed, could slow the economy and prompt a rise in
 interest rates .  “This imbalance is very worrisome,” Bernanke said today
in response to a question during testimony today before the
House Financial Services Committee.  The Fed chief’s comments come as President Barack Obama and
Republicans in Congress are trying to negotiate an agreement to
boost the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling and cut deficits
over the next 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
