The asset-backed  securities market 
needs banks to provide more information on the underlying loans
and make the deals less complex to revive trading, according to
a report by three global regulators.  Policy makers worldwide should improve loan origination
standards for asset-backed bonds, as well as foster greater
transparency and encourage simpler, standardized products, the
so-called  Joint Forum  of bank, securities and insurance
regulators said today.  Asset-backed securities pool loans into bonds of differing
risk and returns, allowing lenders to raise capital more cheaply
than by issuing unsecured debt. The market virtually shut down
after the subprime mortgage crisis caused investors to shun
hard-to-value assets.  The Joint Forum, formed in 1996, is backed by the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision , the  International Organization 
of Securities Commission and the International Association of
Insurance Supervisors. It convenes under the aegis of the Bank
for International Settlements.  The Joint Forumâ€™s 70-page Report on Asset Securitisation
Incentives analyzed asset-backed bond market conditions before
and after the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
