France ’s Sonia Bompastor scored on a
long shot early in the second half to even the Women’s  World Cup 
semifinal with the U.S. 1-1.  The French defender scored in the 55th minute. Lauren
Cheney opened the scoring in Moenchengladbach,  Germany  by
directing in a cross from Heather O’Reilly in the ninth minute.  France controlled the midfield for much of the half, but
could only hit 3 long shots, while the U.S. scored on its only
shot on goal. Bompastor hit the crossbar in the 33rd minute,
while six minutes later Abby Wambach of the U.S. couldn’t head
home after beating the goalkeeper.  The winner will play the victor of today’s semifinal in

finished 2-2 after extra time.  France is in its second Women’s World Cup, after playing in
