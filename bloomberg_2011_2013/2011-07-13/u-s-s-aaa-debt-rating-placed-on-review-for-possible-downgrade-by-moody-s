The U.S. had its Aaa bond rating
placed on review for possible downgrade by Moody’s Investors
Service, which cited the “rising possibility” that the debt
limit won’t be raised on a timely basis.  “There is a small but rising risk of a short-lived
default,” Moody’s said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
