Sales at major South Korean
department stores expanded in June at the slowest pace in four
months, a sign that consumer demand may be moderating.  Outlays at the three biggest chains increased 8.2 percent
from a year earlier in June, after rising 8.7 percent in May,
the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.  Discount-store sales rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier
after a 2.4 percent gain in May, todayâ€™s report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
