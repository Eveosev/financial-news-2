Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. (CNA) , the
Australian coal unit of  Rio Tinto  Group, said second-quarter
sales rose 13 percent after production at its  Hunter Valley 
operations surpassed all quarterly output in the past five years.  Sales reached 5.1 million metric tons in the three months
ended June 30, compared with 4.5 million tons a year earlier,
the Brisbane-based company said in a statement today. Rio Tinto
owns 75.7 percent of Coal & Allied, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Coal production in the Hunter Valley rose 26 percent from a
year earlier as the companyâ€™s load-and-haul performance improved
and inventories recovered from low levels, according to the
statement. Full-year output is on target to rise 5 to 10 percent,
Coal & Allied said.  More than half of the sales in the quarter were sold at
2010 prices because Japanese customers delayed shipments after
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, according to the statement.  Coal & Allied fell 0.8 percent to A$102.31 at 2:23 p.m. in
Sydney trading, compared with the 0.4 percent gain in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
