SuperGroup Plc (SGP) , the U.K. owner of
the Superdry clothing brand, posted an 89 percent rise in full-
year underlying pretax profit as it added outlets and increased
overseas sales.  Pretax profit excluding one-time items was 50.2 million
pounds ($80 million) in the year ended May 1, up from 26.5
million pounds in the same period a year earlier, the
Cheltenham, England-based company said in a regulatory
statement.  SuperGroup added 44 outlets in the U.K. and abroad in the
year, giving it a total of 80. It said full-year external
overseas sales doubled to 58.4 million pounds, and it now gets
60 percent of its wholesale revenue from abroad, up from 49
percent a year earlier, the company said.  “Our U.K. store roll-out is firmly on track with the
addition of a number of prime locations, including one of
 London ’s most iconic and prestigious stores in Regent Street,”
Chief Executive Officer Julian Dunkerton said in the statement.  Full-year net income dropped 58 percent to 30.1 million
pounds as the previous year included a 49.9 million-pound tax
credit following the company’s initial public offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
