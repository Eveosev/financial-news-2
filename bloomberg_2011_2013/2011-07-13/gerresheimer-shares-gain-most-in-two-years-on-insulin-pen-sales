Gerresheimer AG (GXI)  shares rose the most
in more than two years in  Frankfurt  trading after the maker of
inhalers and insulin pens reported second-quarter profit
advanced 19 percent.  Gerresheimer rose as much as 8.7 percent to 35.25 euros,
the biggest gain since April 2009 and the highest level since
August 2008. The shares traded at 35.00 euros at 12:39 p.m. in
Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of 1.1 billion
euros ($1.6 billion).  The Dusseldorf, Germany-based company said net income in
the three months through May rose to 13.3 million euros on
higher sales of molded glass and plastic products, including
inhalers and insulin pens. Revenue during the period increased
5.9 percent to 284.5 million euros.  “The plastics business clearly is the fastest growing
because they have exposure to products for diabetes and
inhalers, which grow quite rapidly,” Stephan Gasteyger, an
analyst with Jefferies International Ltd. who rates Gerresheimer
a “buy,” said by phone. “The molded glass business, which is
more connected with their cosmetics products, is the more
volatile one, which moves around more with the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
