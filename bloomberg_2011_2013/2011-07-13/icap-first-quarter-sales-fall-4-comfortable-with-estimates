ICAP Plc (IAP) , the biggest broker of
transactions between banks, posted a 4 percent drop in first-
quarter sales and said it was “comfortable” with analyst
estimates for full-year profit.  ICAP may report a pretax profit of 366 million pounds ($583
million) to 402 million pounds for the year ending March 2012,
the London-based broker said in a statement today, citing 10
analysts surveyed by the company.  “ICAP has made a good start to the year despite quieter
and more cautious markets in April and May,” Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Spencer  said in the statement. “For the
remainder of the year, we anticipate an uptick in trading as
central banks’ inflation and interest rate strategies start to
diverge.”  ICAP has been investing to take advantage of regulatory
changes in its markets as authorities worldwide demand greater
transparency and more-efficient market infrastructure. Trends
toward electronic or hybrid trading of derivatives and central
clearing will help business, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
