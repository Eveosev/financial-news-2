New York’s Whitney Museum of
American Art, which is borrowing for the first time to build a
new site in lower  Manhattan , pared back yields after investors
placed orders for more than twice the $125 million offering.  “Institutional investors have plenty of room for this name
because they don’t have any credit exposure to it,” said Fred Yosca, head of fixed-income trading at BNY Mellon Capital
Markets LLC in New York.  The securities, rated A, the sixth-highest grade from
 Standard & Poor’s , yielded 3.7 percent for $50 million of debt
due July 2021, the largest portion. Morgan Stanley, the
underwriter, lowered yields on three different maturities,
including a 0.13 percentage point cut to 4.87 percent on the 20-
year bonds, according to a person familiar with the transaction
who declined to be identified because the person wasn't authorized
to speak publicly on the deal.  Strong demand prompted Morgan Stanley to compress the
offering period to one day from two, the person said. More than
21 investors offered a total $286 million in orders while
individuals were alloted $57.5 million, the person said.  The Whitney,  founded in 1931  and specializing in
contemporary U.S. art, has a “non-binding memorandum of
understanding” from  New York ’s Metropolitan Museum of Art for
it to assume operating costs at the Whitney’s Madison Avenue
building, according to the bond offering document. The Whitney
expects the arrangement to be final later in the year, and last
for eight years beginning in 2015, when the museum opens its
downtown space.  Museum Deals  The Met and the Whitney announced their deal May 11, the
day after the Museum of  Modern Art  agreed to buy the
headquarters of the American Folk Art Museum, which is in
default on bond payments.  The new location, which will be more than twice the size of
the Whitney’s current space, is expected to boost the museum’s
average annual attendance to 720,800 in fiscal 2016 from 392,324
a year during fiscal years 2008 to 2010,  Fitch Ratings  said in a
June 30 report.                          The Whitney will depend on gifts and contributions to pay
its debt principal. Its interest-only debt burden will reach 21
percent of its expenses, said Joanne G. Ferrigan and Douglas J.
Kilcommons, Fitch analysts, in the report.  The museum’s endowment totaled $185.6 million as of June
30, according to offering documents. It expects to raise $625
million from its capital campaign by 2015. As of last month, it
had pledges of $411 million, or about 66 percent, the documents
said. The Whitney anticipates full payment of those pledges by
2020, 11 years before the final maturity of the bonds.  ‘Early Retirement’  “Given the museum’s fundraising track record, the early
retirement of debt appears likely,” Fitch said.  For at least the past five fiscal years, the Whitney has
depended on donors for acquisitions of new art, offering
documents said. In that period, donations for new purchases have
dropped every year, to $1.3 million in 2010 from $2.7 million in
2006.  Last month,  California  sold debt on behalf of the Broad
Collection, backed by philanthropist Eli Broad and his charities
with $1.86 billion in assets, which was borrowing for the first
time to build an art museum in  Los Angeles .  Ten-year Broad bonds, awarded Aa1 or second-highest grade
by Moody’s Investors Service, traded at a yield of 3.05 percent
July 8, 25 basis points less than an index of AA+ rated revenue
bonds of the same maturity. That compares with 6 basis points
less than the index on June 21, the day they were sold. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Holders of an A+ rated  Lincoln Center  for the Performing
Arts bond maturing in December 2018 demanded 52 basis points
less than a seven-year A rated index of tax-exempts on June 16.
That compares with a spread of 39 basis points above the
benchmark on Jan. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
