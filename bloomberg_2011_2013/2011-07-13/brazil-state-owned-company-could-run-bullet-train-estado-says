Brazil ’s planned bullet train
linking the cities of  Rio de Janeiro ,  Sao Paulo  and Campinas may
be operated by the state-controlled company ETAV,  O Estado de
S.Paulo  newspaper reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  The government is looking at increasing ETAV’s role in the
running and maintenance of the railway after the project failed
to attract private bidders, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
