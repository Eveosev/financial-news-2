European gasoline’s premium to  Brent
crude , or crack, rose amid expectations the region’s refiners
may boost exports to the U.S. after a report showed inventories
of the fuel in that market dropped for a fourth week.  Gasoline in northwest  Europe  advanced as Cargill Inc.
bought on the barge market. Naphtha’s discount to Brent dropped
to the lowest in almost two weeks.  Light Products  The front-month gasoline crack rose to $7.75 a barrel as of
12:08 p.m. London time, compared with $7.28 yesterday, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd. data on Bloomberg.  U.S. stockpiles dropped by 0.8 percent to 208.4 million
barrels in the week to July 8, the  American Petroleum Institute 
said yesterday. Consumption usually rises in the so-called
driving season, which runs from Memorial Day in the last weekend
of May to Labor Day in the first weekend of September.  “We will see the traditional summer uptake in motor fuel
demand,”  David Fyfe , head of the  International Energy Agency ’s
oil industry and markets division, said today in an interview
with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television. “Having said that
we think it’s going be pretty anemic compared to 2010 overall,”
he said on Nemazee’s “The Pulse.”  Gasoline for immediate loading traded from $1,047 to $1,054
a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That’s up on
yesterday’s highest deal of $1,044 a ton.  Trafigura Beheer BV sold for at least a 10th day on the
barge market, where lots of about 1,000 or 2,000 tons usually
change hands. BP Plc and Morgan Stanley were also among today’s
buyers for the Eurobob grade fuel, which needs ethanol to be
added before it can be sold at the pump.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent was $7.78 a barrel as of 12:10
p.m.  London  time, according to PVM data. That’s the least since
June 30.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil futures dropped on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London. The contract for August delivery declined $1.50, or
0.2 percent, to $965.50 a ton as of 12:11 p.m. local time.
Gasoil is mainly used in heating.  Refineries  Repsol YPF SA’s Petronor refinery said it’s starting its P1
platformer unit.  The refinery began to start the unit last night, Petronor
said in a statement on its website. The 220,000-barrel-a-day
Petronor refinery is located near Bilbao in northern  Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
