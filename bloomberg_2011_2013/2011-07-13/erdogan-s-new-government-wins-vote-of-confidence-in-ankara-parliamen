Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
got a vote of confidence from Turkey’s parliament today,
starting his third-term in government with a promise to rewrite
the constitution and extend economic growth.  The administration formed after June 12 elections got 322
votes in the 550-member assembly in Ankara, speaker Sadik Yakut
said. Pro-Kurdish independent lawmakers still haven’t joined the
parliament.  The governing  Justice and Development Party , or AKP, faces
a record current account deficit that’s sent the Turkish lira to
a two-year low. Erdogan has also pledged to seek consensus with
opposition parties to replace a national charter adopted after a
1980 coup.  Erdogan needs support from his rivals, who staged a protest
of court and electoral board decisions barring their lawmakers
from joining the parliament, signalling that it may be difficult
to get all four parties in the legislature to agree on a new
constitution.  Turkey ’s current account deficit in the 12 months including
May rose to $68.2 billion, or about 9 percent of gross domestic
product and the biggest since the central bank started keeping
records in 1984.      The lira has fallen 7 percent this year and was trading at
1.6510 per dollar at 4:27 p.m. in Istanbul.  The AKP, which has seen record levels of growth since
forming its first government in 2002, needs 330 votes in
parliament to hold a referendum on the new constitution and
support from 367 members to pass it straight into law. Erdogan
has 327 deputies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
