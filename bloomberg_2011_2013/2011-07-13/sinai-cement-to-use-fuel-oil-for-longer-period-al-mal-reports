Sinai Cement (SCEM) , an Egyptian producer
of the building material, will use fuel oil for a longer period
after an explosion disrupted natural-gas supplies,  Al Mal 
reported, citing a company official.  The use of fuel oil as an alternative for natural gas will
cost the company 25 percent more, the Cairo-based newspaper
said, citing Alaa Mogahed, investor relations manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
