Bets that raw sugar traded in  New
York  will remain at the 30 cents a pound level until March next
year increased by 22 percent this month, options trading on ICE
Futures U.S. show.  Investors held 11,698 contracts giving the right to buy
sugar in March at 30 cents a pound as of July 12, up from 9,606
on June 30, according to  exchange  figures. Bets that the price
will be at 30 cents a pound in October also rose, with investors
holding 15,669 contracts, up from 14,198 lots on June 30,
according to the data. The 30 cents a pound strike is the most
active calls for both months. Raw sugar for October rose 0.36
cent, or 1.2 percent, to 30.85 cents a pound on ICE.  The sugar market is getting support from the “heavy open
interest on the 30 cent calls on the August 11, October 11 and
March 12 positions,” Luis Rangel, vice-president of commodity
derivatives at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey ,
wrote in a report e-mailed today. The August options expire on
July 15, he said.  Raw-sugar has risen 17 percent in New York since the end of
June on speculation the crop in  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer, will be smaller than initially estimated. Sugar output
in the Center South, the country’s main producing region,
dropped by almost 25 percent from the start of the harvest to
June 16, data from industry group Unica showed.  The sugar cane crop in the Center South of Brazil will fall
for the first time in 10 years, according to C. Czarnikow Sugar
Futures Ltd. Growers will harvest 535 million metric tons of
cane in the 2011-12 season compared with 557 million tons last
year, Czarnikow said in a report on July 6. Unica will update
its crop forecast at 2 p.m. Sao Paulo time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
