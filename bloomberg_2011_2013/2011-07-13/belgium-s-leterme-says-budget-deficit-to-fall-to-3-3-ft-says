Belgian Prime Minister  Yves Leterme 
said yesterday that the country’s budget deficit in 2011 would
amount to about 3.3 percent, compared with 3.6 percent
previously forecast, the Financial Times reported. The narrower
deficit was due to continued economic growth which helped bring
down social security spending by about 1 billion euros ($1.4
billion), the FT said, citing Leterme.  To contact the reporter on this story:
