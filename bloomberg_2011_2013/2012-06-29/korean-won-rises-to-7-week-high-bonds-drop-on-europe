South Korea ’s won jumped to a seven-
week high and  government bonds  fell as European leaders made
progress in aiding the region’s indebted countries, increasing
demand for riskier assets.  The won weakened earlier after the  finance ministry  cut its
economic growth forecast to 3.3 percent this year, less than a
December estimate of 3.7 percent, according to a statement
yesterday after markets closed. The euro rose the most since
October and the  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rallied as euro-area leaders agreed
to drop their claims as preferred creditors for emergency loans
to Spanish banks and relax conditions on possible help for  Italy .  “The euro jumping on reports from Europe and South Korean
exporters selling the dollar triggered investors to stop their
long positions on the dollar,” said Kim Do Hee, a Seoul-based
currency trader at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. A
long position is a bet an asset will gain in value.  The won strengthened 0.8 percent to 1,145.40 per dollar at
the close in  Seoul , after weakening by as much as 0.3 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,144.96
earlier, the strongest since May 11. The currency gained 1
percent since June 22, posting a fifth weekly gain. It has
strengthened 3 percent this month, paring its quarterly drop to
1.1 percent.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped 31 basis
points, or 0.31 percentage point, to 7.57 percent.  ‘Yields May Rise’  South Korea’s  industrial output  rose 1.1 percent in May
from the previous month, beating the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey for a 0.3 percent gain, data showed today.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 rose four basis points to 3.42 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. The rate has dropped 25 basis points this quarter.
Three-year debt futures fell 0.14 to 104.68 and the one-year
interest-rate swap advanced two basis points to 3.34 percent.  “We saw overseas investors and foreign banks selling South
Korean bond futures after reports from  Europe ,” said Lee Seung Hoon, a Seoul-based fixed-income analyst at Samsung Futures Inc.
“Bond yields may rise for some time if we see more progress
from the Europe summit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
