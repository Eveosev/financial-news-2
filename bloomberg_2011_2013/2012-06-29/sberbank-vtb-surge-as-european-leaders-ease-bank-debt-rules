OAO Sberbank and VTB Group,  Russia ’s
biggest lenders, rallied after European leaders agreed to ease
repayment rules for the region’s troubled lenders.  VTB gained 6 percent to 5.71 kopeks by the close in Moscow,
the biggest jump since October 2010. Sberbank rose 4.4 percent
to 86.39 rubles, the most since May 29.  Financial shares  climbed after European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy  said leaders of the 17 euro countries dropped
the requirement that governments get preferred creditor status
on crisis loans to  Spain ’s banks. MSCI Inc.’s Russia Finance
Index added 6.9 percent to 551.31, the biggest jump since Nov.
30.  “The financial sector is outperforming today,” Farhan Kazmi, the head of emerging-market equities at Credit Suisse
Group AG in Moscow, said by phone. “Markets, such as Russia,
follow the lead of what’s going on in the Eurozone in absence of
the domestic newsflow. The European decision is not a game
changer, but it buys time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
