Ethanol futures rose to the highest
level in 11 weeks in Chicago on optimism  Europe ’s debt crisis
may be alleviated after leaders eased repayment rules for
Spanish banks.  Prices capped the biggest monthly gain since October as
leaders of the 17 euro countries dropped requirements that
taxpayers get preferred creditor status on aid to  Spain ’s banks,
tempering concern that the crisis could spread and sap global
fuel demand.  “It’s total widespread commodity buying,” said  Terry Reilly , an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.
“It’s supported by everything else being up.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 2.4 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.233 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since April 12. Futures gained 11 percent this
month and are up 1.4 percent this year. They slipped 1.4 percent
in the second quarter.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast surged
4.5 cents to $2.38 a gallon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In Chicago, the additive increased 3.5 cents to
$2.245.  Ethanol in  New York  added 3 cents to $2.31 a gallon, and,
on the U.S. Gulf, the biofuel gained 2.5 cents to $2.32.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials,
which includes corn, gasoline and crude oil, jumped 5.6 percent
to 599.44, the biggest gain since April 2, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
