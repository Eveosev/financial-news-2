Fenerbahce Sportif Hizmetler Sanayi
& Ticaret AS (FENER) , the listed arm of Istanbul soccer club Fenerbahce,
gained after reporting it will earn $11 million from its
sponsorship agreement with  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM)  and Avea
Iletisim Hizmetleri AS.  The shares added 2.7 percent to 56.25 liras, heading for
their highest since May 11.  Avea, which currently has its logo on the front of
Fenerbahce’s jerseys, and Turk Telekom, with a logo on the arm,
will switch places under a new advertising agreement, Fenerbahce
said in a statement to the exchange today.  Avea is the mobile unit of Turk Telekom, Turkey’s largest
landline telephone company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
