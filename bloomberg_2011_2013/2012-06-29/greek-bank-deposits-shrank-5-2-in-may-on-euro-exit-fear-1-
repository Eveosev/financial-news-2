Greek bank deposits by businesses
and households decreased by 8.6 billion euros ($10.8 billion),
or 5.2 percent, in May after an inconclusive national election
raised the prospect of the country’s exit from the euro region.  Deposits fell to 157.4 billion euros from 166 billion euros
in April, the biggest drop since the country joined the 17-
nation currency bloc in January 2001, according to a statement
by the  Bank of Greece  on its website today. Deposits have
declined 52 billion euros, or 25 percent, since December 2010.  Greece  held a second election in six weeks on June 17 after
an inconclusive poll on May 6 showed gains for parties that
rejected the terms of the country’s bailout loans from the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  “Deposit outflows reached a new historic high” after the
May election led to “heightened sovereign risk” and political
uncertainty, Manos Giakoumis, a research director for  Euroxx
Securities SA (EX)  in Athens, said in an e-mailed note. “A reversal
of the negative trend is anticipated in the post-election
period.”  Greece’s new finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, said on
June 26 that 2 billion euros of deposits had returned to the
country’s bank system since the June elections produced a three-
party coalition government committed to honoring the country’s
bailout terms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
