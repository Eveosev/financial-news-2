Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K.’s largest homebuilder by market value, rose to the highest
in more than three months in  London  trading after reporting
profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  The shares advanced 3.2 percent. Net income increased 66
percent to 158.5 million pounds ($247 million) in the 12 months
through April after the Cobham, England-based company sold more
of its homes at higher prices, according to a statement today.
Analysts expected a figure of about 156 million pounds, the
average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are becoming more London-centric,” Managing Director
Rob Perrins said in an interview today. “You can always sell in
London; you want to be in international cities, you want to be
in the prime areas.”  Homebuilding is failing to keep up with a growing number of
households in the U.K., supporting values even as inflation,
anemic wage increases and lending curbs have undermined buying
power. Now is an “excellent time” to buy a home because the
shortage will continue to push up prices, former  Bank of England 
policy maker  Charles Goodhart  said in an interview yesterday.  Berkeley rose 44 pence to 1,409 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close of trading in London, raising the company’s market value
to 1.85 billion pounds and overtaking  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  as the
biggest U.K. homebuilder by that measure. The shares have added
about 8.8 percent in the past 12 months.  Higher Prices  The company’s profit for fiscal 2012 was the biggest in six
years. Home sales rose to 3,565 from 2,544 a year earlier,
according to the statement. The average selling price increased
3 percent to 280,000 pounds. Revenue climbed 40 percent to 1.04
billion pounds.  The operating margin, excluding a 30.7 million-pound gain
on the sale of a student accommodation asset, rose to 18.8
percent from 18.3 percent a year earlier.  “There is plenty to be positive about and in the short-
term, the shares should go better,” Panmure Gordon & Co.
analysts  Mark Hughes  and Rachael Applegate said in a note to
investors today. The company has a hold rating on the stock.  An increase in the tax for homes sold for more than 2
million pounds will affect about 100 homes being built by
Berkeley in the next three years, Perrins said. Chancellor
 George Osborne  raised the levy, known as the stamp duty, to 7
percent from 5 percent in March.  “I’m disappointed with the government; I think they’re
anti-growth,” Perrins said by telephone.  About 1,620 homes worth more than 2 million pounds were
sold in England and  Wales  last year, according to the U.K. Land
Registry. Luxury-home prices in central London rose the least in
nine months in May after the British government increased
property transaction tax.  Cash due on forward sales was 1.06 billion pounds for the
year through April compared with 813.5 million pounds. Net debt
was 57.9 million pounds compared with 42 million pounds a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
