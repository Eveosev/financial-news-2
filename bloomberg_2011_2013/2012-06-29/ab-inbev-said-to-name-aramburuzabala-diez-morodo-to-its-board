Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , which
agreed to buy the remaining 50 percent of Grupo Modelo SAB for
$20.1 billion today, will name Modelo’s vice chairman and vice
president to its board, according to a person with knowledge of
the situation.  AB InBev will appoint Maria Asuncion Aramburuzabala and
Valentin Diez Morodo, said the person, who did not wish to be
named because the news has not yet been publicly announced.
Aramburuzabala and Diez Morodo are on the board of Mexico-city
based Modelo.  Two new AB InBev board members have committed to invest
$1.5 billion of the proceeds from selling their Modelo shares
into AB InBev shares, which will be delivered within five years
via a deferred share instrument, according to a  statement  from
AB InBev and Modelo today.  AB InBev, based in Leuven,  Belgium , gained a 50 percent
non-controlling stake in Modelo, the maker of Corona, in InBev
NV’s $52 billion takeover of Anheuser-Busch Cos. in 2008. It
said today it agreed to buy the rest of the Mexican brewer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
