The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
capped the biggest June rally since 1999 after European leaders
reached an agreement that alleviated concern banks will fail.  All  10 groups  in the  S&P 500  rose as industrial, technology
and commodity shares had the biggest gains.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) ,
Apple Inc. and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  climbed at least 2.6
percent to pace rallies among the biggest companies.  Exxon Mobil (XOM) 
Corp. jumped 3 percent as oil surged 9.4 percent, the most in
more than three years as commodities surged. KB Home climbed 13
percent after the homebuilder reported a narrower loss.  The S&P 500 jumped 2.5 percent, the most in 2012, to
1,362.16 at 4 p.m. New York time. It rallied 4 percent this
 month  for the biggest advance since February. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  added 277.83 points, or 2.2 percent, to
12,880.09. It had the biggest monthly advance since October,
rising 3.9 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell
2000 Index rose at least 2.9 percent today, the most in 2012.
Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 7.9 billion
shares, or 16 percent above the three-month average.  “We are getting a pretty nice relief rally,” said
Christopher Orndorff, who helps oversee $450 billion as senior
portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co. in Pasadena,
 California . He spoke in a telephone interview. Europe’s deal
“appears to be a step in the right direction in terms of
solving the problem from a longer term perspective.”  Stocks gained, joining a global rally, as European leaders
agreed to relax conditions on emergency loans for Spanish banks
and possible help for Italy as an outflanked German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  gave in on expanded steps to stem the debt crisis.  Second Quarter  Today’s gain trimmed the second-quarter decline in the S&P
500 to 3.3 percent. The index still capped the worst quarter
since September. More than $1 trillion was erased from U.S.
equity values from the end of March through yesterday on concern
about a worsening of Europe’s debt crisis and a global slowdown.  The Dow slumped 2.5 percent this quarter. Over the last
century, July has been the  best month  for the 30-stock gauge,
with an average return of 1.4 percent, according to data
compiled by Bespoke Investment Group. It has rallied an average
0.8 percent in July over the last 50 years, the data showed.  In the U.S., business activity unexpectedly expanded in
June at a faster pace. Other reports showed that  consumer
spending  stalled in May, while household sentiment dropped in
June to the lowest level of the year.  The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)  of companies most-tied to
the economy jumped 2.7 percent. The Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, which measures the cost of using
options as insurance against S&P 500 losses, tumbled 13 percent
to 17.08, extending its monthly plunge to 29 percent.  Apple, Exxon  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, gained 2.8 percent to $84.91. Apple, the most-
valuable company, added 2.6 percent to $584. Bank of America
increased 5.7 percent to $8.18. Exxon Mobil jumped 3 percent to
$85.57.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the first company in the Dow to report
quarterly  results  on July 9, added 2.8 percent to $8.75.  A measure of homebuilders in S&P indexes jumped 4.8
percent, to the highest level since 2008.  KB Home (KBH)  climbed 13
percent to $9.80 as the company sold more houses at higher
prices during its fiscal second quarter ended May 31.  Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ)  surged 24 percent to $27.06 after
agreeing to buy the other half of its Crown Imports joint
venture with  Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC)  for about $1.85 billion, becoming
the sole U.S. importer of top-selling Corona beer.  ValueClick Inc. (VCLK)  soared 16 percent to $16.39. The Internet-
advertising company said second-quarter  revenue  was probably at
the higher end of its forecast range.  Truck Engine  Navistar International Corp. (NAV)  climbed 11 percent to $28.37.
The company, which is trying to get its 13-liter truck engine
certified for sale in the U.S., rallied after a report that it
may start offering Cummins Inc. engines in addition to its own
MaxxForce product.  Nike Inc. (NKE)  tumbled 9.4 percent, the most since 2008, to
$87.78. Fourth-quarter profit at the world’s largest sporting-
goods company unexpectedly declined for the first time since
2009 as marketing costs increased and sales growth slowed.  Car companies had the biggest loss in the S&P 500 among 24
industries, dropping 1 percent.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  slumped 5 percent
to $9.59. The automaker said its pretax operating profit will be
“substantially lower” in the second quarter in part because
overseas losses tripled from the year’s first three months.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  plunged 19 percent to $7.39, the
lowest since 2003, after posting a  loss  and delaying the next
BlackBerry operating system, increasing pressure on the company
to find an acquirer. The Waterloo, Ontario-based smartphone
maker also said it would cut 5,000 jobs.  34% Decline  Initial public offerings fell 34 percent this quarter as
Facebook Inc.’s disappointing debut and worsening economic
conditions rattled investors, pressuring companies to lure
buyers with cheaper valuations.  IPOs globally raised $41.3 billion, the worst second
quarter since 2009, Bloomberg data show. That compared with
$62.7 billion a year ago. At least 50 companies shelved sales as
Europe’s debt crisis spread, growth prospects slowed in China
and Facebook’s stock sank 18 percent from its May 17  IPO (FB)  price.  “With the economy and with Europe, there are more
questions than answers in investors’ minds, and they want some
clarity before they put their money down,” said  Matt McCormick ,
who helps oversee $6.2 billion at Cincinnati-based Bahl & Gaynor
Inc. “After what happened with Facebook, people want IPOs to go
off without a hitch.”  Monthlong Drought  Facebook flopped after pricing its IPO at more than 100
times earnings and kicked off a monthlong drought in the U.S.
Global IPOs that followed, including Felda Global Ventures
Holdings Bhd, a Malaysian palm-oil plantation operator, and EQT
Midstream Partners LP, offered discounts to investors.  Coty Inc., the perfume maker that pulled a takeover offer
for  Avon Products Inc. (AVP) , filed for an initial public offering
seeking as much as $700 million.  All the shares in the IPO will be offered by existing
shareholders, the company said in a filing today. Coty, based in
New York, withdrew its sweetened $10.7 billion offer for Avon on
May 15, citing the cosmetics seller’s refusal to negotiate. The
company hired Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan
Stanley to help manage its share sale, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
