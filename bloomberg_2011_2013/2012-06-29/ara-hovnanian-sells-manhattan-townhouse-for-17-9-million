Ara Hovnanian, chief executive
officer of homebuilder  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV) , sold a
townhouse in Manhattan’s West Village for $17.9 million, a 15
percent discount from what he initially sought.  The buyer of the 8,100-square-foot (750-square-meter) home
on West 12th Street was listed as 16 West 12 Holdings LLC,
according to  New York  City property records filed today.  Hovnanian bought the five-story townhouse in January 2010
for $15.4 million, and put it on the market in September 2011
for $21 million, according to StreetEasy.com, a Manhattan
property-listings website.  “This glamorous, mint-condition, 25-foot elevator
townhouse on a prime Greenwich Village block has been recently
renovated to blend great style and light with dramatic and
spacious interiors,” according to the  listing  by broker Jill
Roosevelt at Brown Harris Stevens.  The property includes a formal dining room that seats 30
people, a cobblestone garden, a master suite with his and her
baths, and a private dressing room, according to the listing.
The ground floor has two rooms for maids.  Hovnanian’s  Red Bank , New Jersey-based company, which
operates in 16 states, earlier this month reported an unexpected
profit and a 52 percent jump in home orders in the quarter ended
April 30.  Jeff O’Keefe, vice president of  investor relations  at
Hovnanian Enterprises, said he couldn’t immediately comment on
the sale. Roosevelt declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
