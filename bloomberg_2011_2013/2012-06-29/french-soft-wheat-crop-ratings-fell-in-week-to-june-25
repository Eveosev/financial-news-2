French soft wheat rated “good” or
“excellent” fell in the week ended June 25, crop office
FranceAgriMer said.  Seventy-two percent of the soft wheat crop received the top
ratings, down from 73 percent a week earlier, the Montreuil-
sous-Bois, France-based office wrote on its  website  today. That
compares with 29 percent rated “good” or “excellent” a year
earlier, when a spring drought stunted growth.  France  is the European Union’s largest wheat producer. The
ratings released today are the average for eight regions
representing 54 percent of France’s soft-wheat area,
FranceAgriMer wrote.  Durum  wheat rated “good” or “excellent” fell to 54
percent from 57 percent a week earlier, based on three regions
that make up 58 percent of French production, the data show.
Durum is a hard variety of the grain used to make pasta.  Corn 
with top ratings was unchanged at 73 percent.  Winter  barley  with “good” or “excellent” ratings rose
to 66 percent from 65 percent a week earlier.  Spring  barley
rated in the top two categories was unchanged at 84 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
