H.G. Raghunath, chief operating
officer for watches and accessories at  Titan Industries Ltd. (TTAN) ,
comments on watch buying behavior and growth plans for small
towns. Raghunath spoke in a phone interview from Bangalore on
June 28.  Titan will add as many as 250 new stores this year, most of
of which will be for its Fast Track brand, which is aimed at
young customers, Raghunath said.  On watch buying:  “Long back, watches were a considered purchase. With large
department stores and attractive shopping experience available
to people, it appears watches are also becoming an impulse
purchase.  ‘‘All the three segments we have Titan, Fast Track and
Sonata are leaders in their segments. Our market share is close
to 47 percent.’’  On small town prospects:  ‘‘There are about 380 towns with a population of over
100,000, where everything is changing -- the consumer behavior,
the purchase desire. We want to have a powerful brand presence
in each of these towns through a format called Titan One. It’s a
smaller store, but in that town it will be a very important
destination store.  ‘‘People in middle India aspire for good quality brands,
reputed brands. They also like to buy Titan, Fast Track and all.  ‘‘We’d like to participate in the emerging middle-India
town story to a very great extent in the year 2012-13. We are
planning to see how we can set up about 100 to 120 such stores
to start with, and then start really being present in a powerful
manner.’’  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
