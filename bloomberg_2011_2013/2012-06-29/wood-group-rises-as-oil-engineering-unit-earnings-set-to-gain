John Wood Group Plc (WG/) , a U.K. oil
services provider active in Africa and the  Middle East , rose in
London trading after saying that sales from its engineering unit
are set to increase.  Shares of the Aberdeen, Scotland-based company rose as much
as 3.4 percent and traded up 2.2 percent at 684 pence as of 8:26
a.m. in London.  The engineering unit’s earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization will gain about 30 percent this year compared with
2011, Wood Group said in a trading statement today. The
company’s full-year performance will be in line with its
expectations, it said.  “We expect engineering to continue to outperform, driven
by a strong upstream market,” Nick Copeman, an analyst at Oriel
Securities Ltd., said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
