The recent decline in the  yuan  is
opening the door for Chinese policy makers to loosen controls on
the country’s capital markets, according to HSBC Global Asset
Management.  The yuan has depreciated 0.9 percent this year after rising
31 percent in the seven years through 2011. Lowered expectations
for currency appreciation will drive away speculators, creating
a window to carry out changes such as reducing the government’s
control of  interest rates , said Geoffrey Lunt, a senior product
specialist for fixed income at HSBC Global Asset Management.  “The stars have aligned,” Lunt said in an interview at
Bloomberg’s headquarters in  New York . “All the steps they’ve
taken are going in the same direction.”  China has sped up the reforms in the  capital markets  this
year, giving banks more freedom to decide on deposit and lending
rates, widening the yuan’s trading band and more than doubling
the amount foreigners can invest in domestic financial markets.  Further opening up of the market will create more
investment opportunities, said Lunt, whose company started a
fund this month to invest in  yuan-denominated fixed-income 
securities.  The yuan will continue to rise between 2 and 4 percent
against the dollar annually over the coming years, as growth in
China outpaces the U.S., according to Lunt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
