Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , the world’s
biggest brewer, said it will fund the acquisition of Mexico’s
Grupo Modelo SAB with $14 billion of new loans.  The maker of Budweiser got a three-year, $8 billion term
loan and a $6 billion facility for as long as two years, the
Leuven, Belgium-based company said today in a statement.  The company expects its net debt to be below the target of
2 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization in 2014.  AB InBev said today it agreed to buy the remainder of
Modelo it doesn’t already own for $20.1 billion, gaining full
control of the Corona maker to increase its presence in  emerging
markets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
