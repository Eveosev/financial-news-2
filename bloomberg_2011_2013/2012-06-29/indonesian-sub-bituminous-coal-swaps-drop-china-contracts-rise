Swap contracts fell for lower-
quality coal from Indonesia, the world’s biggest exporter of the
power-station fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.
Prices for deliveries to  China  climbed.  The price for sub-bituminous  coal  with a heating value of
4,900 kilocalories a kilogram for loading from Indonesia in the
third quarter dropped 15 cents to $63.60 a metric ton on a net
as-received basis yesterday, the energy broker said in an e-mail
today. The July swap was 5 cents lower at $63.20 a ton.  Coal with a calorific value of 5,500 kilocalories a
kilogram for shipment to South China in July gained 40 cents to
$85.50 a ton on a net as-received basis, Ginga said. The swap
for the third quarter rose 25 cents to $86.25.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of  Indonesia ’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. The grade is typically softer, with a dull, earthy
appearance, according to the London-based World Coal Association.
Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content reduce the
heating value compared with grades with a better quality stock.
Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100 per kilogram,
according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
