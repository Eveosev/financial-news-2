U.K. stocks  rallied the most in more
than a week after euro-area leaders agreed to ease conditions on
bailout loans to Spanish banks and pledged to spend $152 billion
to stimulate the region’s economy.  CRH Plc and Wolseley Plc led construction-related shares
higher, both climbing at least 4 percent.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) 
and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  climbed as copper surged.  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  rebounded from
yesterday’s selloff.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  surged 78.09 points, or 1.4 percent, to
5,571.15 at the close in  London , extending its monthly advance
to 4.7 percent, the biggest since October. The gauge has still
lost 3.4 percent this quarter,  erasing its gain for the year , as
European Union policy makers struggled to contain the sovereign-
debt crisis.  “The second quarter ends with some unexpected good news,”
Ian Williams, a strategist at Peel Hunt LLP in London, wrote in
a report to clients. “The European Union summit has at least
agreed a short-term fix in permitting the EU’s rescue funds to
intervene directly by buying sovereign debt and recapitalizing
the banks without an impact on government deficits. It’s good
enough for now.”  Preferred Creditors  After 13 1/2 hours of talks ending at 4:30 a.m. in
Brussels, the leaders of the 17 euro countries waived their
governments’ preferred-creditor status on bailout loans to
Spanish banks. They also opened the door to recapitalizing
lenders directly using the European Stability Mechanism once the
euro area sets up a single banking supervisor.  The broader FTSE All-Share Index rose 1.5 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index jumped 2.5 percent as Irish Prime
Minister  Enda Kenny  said the burden on taxpayers may be eased by
the  EU agreement .  EU leaders discussed reducing the market pressure on Italy
and Spain, by allowing them to access rescue loans without
relinquishing control of their economies.  All but five companies on the FTSE 100 rose today as the EU
leaders also agreed to a 120 billion-euro ($152 billion) plan to
promote growth in the 27-nation bloc though infrastructure
financing.  CRH, the world’s second-biggest building-materials maker,
advanced 7.3 percent to 1,232 pence in London. Wolseley, the
largest supplier of heating and plumbing products, jumped 4
percent to 2,377 pence.  Mining Companies  A  gauge  of mining shares rallied 2.6 percent as copper
advanced the most since November in London. Lead, nickel, tin
and zinc also climbed.  Vedanta Resources surged 4.7 percent to 912 pence,
Antofagasta gained 4 percent to 1,088 pence and Rio Tinto Group,
 the world’s third-largest mining company , climbed 3.6 percent to
3,019 pence.  Lloyds paced a rally in European banks, climbing 3.9
percent to 31.1 pence. RBS gained 4.3 percent to 215.3 pence and
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s largest lender, increased 0.5
percent to 561.1 pence.  A gauge of U.K. lenders tumbled 4.3 percent yesterday, with
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  slumping 16 percent, after the lender’s fines from
falsifying London interbank-offered rate submissions sparked
speculation more lawsuits will follow. Barclays extended its
slide today, falling 1.7 percent to 162.85 pence.  Berkeley Group  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG)  climbed 3.2 percent to 1,409
pence after the homebuilder reported a 66 percent increase in
 annual profit  to 158.5 million pounds ($249 million) as the
company sold more properties at higher prices. Analysts had
projected 156 million pounds, the  average of three estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Demand for residential property in good locations in
London and the Southeast remained strong throughout the year,
attracting interest from both U.K. domestic and international
buyers,” Berkeley said in a statement.  Rival housebuilder  Persimmon Plc (PSN)  soared 6.8 percent to 609
pence.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  increased 5.6 percent to 47.78 pence,
while  Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV)  surged 6.8 percent to 139.1
pence.  Pennon Group Plc dropped 1.9 percent to 762 pence, the
worst performer on the FTSE 100. Suez Environnement Co. plunged
to its lowest price in Paris since Europe’s second-biggest water
utility held its initial public offering in 2008 after saying
the “uncertain” economic outlook will crimp profit.  The volume of shares traded on the FTSE 100 was 18 percent
higher than the average of the last 30 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
