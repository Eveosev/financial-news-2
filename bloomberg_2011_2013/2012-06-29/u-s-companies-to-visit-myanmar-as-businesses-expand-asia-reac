U.S. companies based in  Southeast
Asia  are planning a trade mission to Myanmar in August as
businesses seek new markets in one of the world’s fastest-
growing regions.  Twenty delegates led by U.S. Ambassador to  Singapore  David Adelman and Kevin Thieneman, president of Caterpillar Asia, will
visit the Southeast Asian nation from Aug. 12 to Aug. 16, the
American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore said in a statement
yesterday. They may meet with senior government officials, it
said.  Myanmar is enhancing economic, military and political ties
with Western nations after years of isolation that left its 64
million people among Asia’s poorest. The country’s transition to
democracy in recent months after about five decades of military
rule prompted the U.S. to ease sanctions in May.  Developing Asian economies are forecast by the
 International Monetary Fund  to expand 7.3 percent in 2012,
exceeding the global average of 3.5 percent.  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  said
this month it would return to Myanmar for the first time in 60
years once the U.S. government licenses the investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
