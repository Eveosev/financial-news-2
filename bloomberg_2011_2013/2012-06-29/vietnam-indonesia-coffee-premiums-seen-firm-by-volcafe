Buyers of coffee from top robusta
grower Vietnam and third-ranking  Indonesia  are paying higher
premiums for beans because of limited availability, according to
Volcafe, the coffee unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Vietnamese beans for July and August shipment were at a
premium of $60 a metric ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in London, data from the Winterthur, Switzerland-based
trader show. That’s unchanged from last week and higher than the
$40 a ton two weeks earlier, according to the data.  Indonesian coffee for shipment in the same period was at a
premium of $70 a ton to the exchange price, unchanged from the
previous two weeks, according to Volcafe. The premium was $10 a
ton in the week ended June 8, data from the trader showed.  Robusta coffee is “still on the shopping list” for
industry buyers, the trader said in a weekly report to clients
e-mailed today. “The opportunity to buy raw coffee remains
scarce and highly expensive,” in  Vietnam , Volcafe added.  In Indonesia, the local industry is buying and building
stockpiles to bridge the end of the 2012-13 crop there and the
start of the Vietnamese season, it said. Bean arrivals at ports
there were about 10,000 tons this week, Volcafe added.  The 2012-13 crop in Vietnam is unlikely to match that of
2011-12, Volcafe said in the report, citing its most recent crop
survey and without providing a new estimate.  The 2012-13 season started in April in Indonesia and will
begin in October in Vietnam. Vietnam’s production will be 24
million bags in 2011-12, the trader estimated last month. At the
time, it said Vietnam would produce 22 million bags for 2012-13.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
