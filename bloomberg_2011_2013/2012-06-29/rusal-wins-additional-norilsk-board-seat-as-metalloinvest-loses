United Co. Rusal, the world’s
largest aluminum producer, had three of its executives,
including billionaire  Oleg Deripaska , elected to the board of
 OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (MNOD) , increasing its seats by one.  Billionaire Vladimir Potanin’s Interros Holding, which is
locked in a shareholder dispute with Rusal over management of
Norilsk, has four of its executives on the board, according to
the results of annual shareholders meeting announced to
reporters today in Moscow. One of the four, Andrei Bugrov, was
re-elected chairman.  Billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s partner Farhad Moshiri wasn’t
elected after the Norilsk stake held by their Metalloinvest
dropped to 3.6 percent from 4 percent following last year’s
share buyback by the nickel miner.  Metalloinvest supported independent directors with its
votes because Moshiri decided he can’t currently effectively
combine his role as Metalloinvest chairman with serving on the
Norilsk board, a Metalloinvest official said, requesting not to
be identified in accordance with his company’s policy.  Norilsk Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Strzalkovsky,
Claude Dauphin, a member of the management board of Trafigura
Beheer BV, and  Alexander Voloshin , former chief of staff to
President  Boris Yeltsin , were also elected.  Norilsk’s board has 13 seats, with the rest held by
independent directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
