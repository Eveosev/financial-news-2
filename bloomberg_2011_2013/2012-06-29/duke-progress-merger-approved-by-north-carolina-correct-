Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) ’s $17.8 billion
purchase of  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  is expected to close on July 2
after a meeting of South Carolina regulators.  The Public Service Commission of South Carolina plans to
review how the companies will coordinate electricity delivery
from their combined power plants,  Mike Hughes , a spokesman for
Raleigh, North Carolina-based Progress, said in a telephone
interview.  The merger creating the largest U.S. power company was
approved earlier today by the North Carolina Utilities
Commission, according to a regulatory filing.  While the approval from North Carolina regulators was the
last needed to close the deal, the utilities won’t complete the
transaction until South Carolina’s commission reviews the
agreement during a July 2 hearing slated to begin at 11:30 a.m.
local time, Hughes said.  Assuming the South Carolina hearing’s outcome is favorable,
“we expect to close Monday afternoon,” Hughes said.  Tom Williams , a spokesman for Charlotte-based Duke, said
the company won’t speculate on a time for closing the
transaction until South Carolina regulators approve the
purchase.  The takeover by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke was
announced in January 2011 and will create the largest owner of
U.S. electric utilities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
