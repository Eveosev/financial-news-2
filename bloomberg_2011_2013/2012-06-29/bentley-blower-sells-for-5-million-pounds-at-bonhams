A 1929 Bentley single-seat racer
that once reached 137 miles per hour sold today for 5 million
pounds ($7.8 million), making it the most expensive example of
the U.K.-made marque ever sold at public auction.  The 4.5-liter supercharged “Blower” Bentley was the star
lot at Bonhams’s sale of the Daniels Collection of classic autos
at the  Goodwood Festival of Speed  in Sussex, southern  England .  The car achieved record speeds around the banked Brooklands
track when driven by Henry “Tim” Birkin, one of the “Bentley
Boy” racers of the 1920s and 1930s. More recently, it had been
owned by George Daniels, a U.K.-based maker of bespoke watches.  The Bentley, which carried no official presale estimate,
was acquired by an unidentified buyer in the salesroom against
competition from two other bidders, said Bonhams.  A 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa prototype, which competed in
the Le Mans 24-hour race, remains the most expensive car sold at
auction. It went for $16.4 million at Gooding & Co. in August
2011 at the Monterey Car Week in  California . Earlier this month,
a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO made for race driver Stirling Moss sold
in a private transaction for a record $35 million.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
