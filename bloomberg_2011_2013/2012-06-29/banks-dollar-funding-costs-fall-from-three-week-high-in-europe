The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined from the highest in more than three
weeks, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 54 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 9 a.m. in  London 
from minus 59 basis points yesterday, the highest since June 4.
The cost has increased for the past two months.  The one-year basis swap was at 50 basis points below
Euribor from minus 53 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. Euribor is the rate  banks  say they see each
other lending in euros and is derived from a survey by the
European Banking Federation.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to a gauge of overnight borrowing costs or overnight
indexed swaps -- known as the  FRA/OIS spread  -- were at 27.5
basis points from 28. A decrease signals banks are more willing
to lend. The Euribor/Eonia OIS spread was 41 basis points from
42.  The Eonia OIS swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, was little changed
at 24 basis points. The measure held below the  European Central
Bank ’s deposit rate of 25 basis points for the 10th day.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday, placing 782 billion euros ($984 billion) from 773
billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
