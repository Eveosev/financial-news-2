BioInvent International AB (BINV)  rose as
much as 6.8 percent in Stockholm trading as the biotechnology
company said it will start trade union talks to cut 21 jobs
after it halted development of an anti-thrombotic drug
candidate.  After the cuts, the company plans to have 68 full-time
employees, compared with 89 now. Resources will be
“reprioritized” to focus on the continued development
of a drug for the treatment of acute coronary artery disease and
new and existing cancer projects, the Swedish company said in a
statement today. The staff cuts and other measures will save
around 15 million kronor ($2.2 million) a year, starting in
January 2013, it said.  The stock was up 0.2 kronor, or 3.9 percent, to 5.4 kronor
as of 1:10 p.m. in the Swedish capital.  BioInvent plummeted 63 percent June 5, the Lund, Sweden-
based drugmaker’s biggest intraday fall on record, after it
said, with its partner  ThromboGenics NV (THR) , it would halt
development of blood thinner TB-402 after excessive bleeding in
a clinical trial. ThromboGenics fell as much as 21 percent that
day, also its biggest decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
