Lithuania’s central government
budget deficit was 1.9 percent of gross domestic product in the
first five months of the year, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall, calculated on a cash basis, narrowed from
2.5 percent in the same period of 2011, the ministry, based in
the capital, Vilnius, said today on its website. The measure
includes all public finances except municipal budgets.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’ government wants to narrow
the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP this year from 5.5
percent in 2011. Government debt fell to 38.6 percent of
economic output at the end of May from 40.5 percent in April,
the ministry said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
