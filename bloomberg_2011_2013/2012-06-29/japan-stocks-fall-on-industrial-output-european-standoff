Japanese  stocks  advanced, sending
the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average to the highest close since May 10,
as euro-area leaders agreed to ease repayment rules for
emergency loans to Spanish banks and relax potential aid for
Italy at a regional summit dealing with the debt crisis.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that depends on Europe for
almost a third of its sales, rose 1.8 percent.  Nomura Holdings
Inc. (8604)  gained 3.9 percent ahead of a press conference today to
discuss an internal probe on  insider trading . Sparx Group Co.
surged 18 percent after the asset manager won a state contract
to start a renewable energy fund.  “Many investors didn’t expect European leaders to make any
progress at the summit, but aggressive action was the result,”
said Yoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at Okasan Online Securities
Co. in  Tokyo .  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.5 percent to 9,006.78 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, with volume almost 20 percent above the 30-day
average. The gauge has fallen 11 percent this quarter. The
broader  Topix (TPX)  advanced 1.5 percent to 770.08, after earlier
falling as much as 0.6 percent on a report Japan’s industrial
production dropped the most since the 2011 earthquake.  Stocks rebounded after European Union President  Herman Van
Rompuy  said leaders of the 17 euro countries dropped the
requirement that governments get preferred creditor status on
loans to Spain’s blighted banks. Lenders can also be
recapitalized directly by bailout funds rather than going
through governments, he said.  The deal comes after French President  Francois Hollande  put
his nation’s endorsement of a German-backed deficit treaty on
hold, and Italy and Spain withheld approval of a 120 billion-
euro ($149 billion) regional growth package.  Euro Surges  The euro surged as much as 1.4 percent against the yen
after earlier falling as much as 0.3 percent, boosting the value
of overseas income at some Japanese companies when repatriated.  Canon rose 1.8 percent to 3,165 yen.  Makita Corp. (6586) , a power-
tool maker that gets almost half its sales in Europe, gained 2.2
percent to 2,773 yen.  The Topix has dropped about 12 percent from its peak on
March 27 amid slowing growth in the U.S. and China as  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis spreads.  Nomura Holdings climbed 3.9 percent to 294 yen. Chief
Executive Officer Kenichi Watanabe is expected to hold a news
conference today in Tokyo to discuss an internal probe of
allegations the brokerage leaked information used for share
sales it managed in 2010. The securities firm is expected to cut
the pay of top executives, including Watanabe, according to
people with knowledge of the matter.  Sparx Group surged by its daily limit of 1,000 yen, or 18
percent, to 6,680 yen after securing a contract from the Tokyo
government to start an infrastructure fund that will invest in
the renewable energy, including solar plants and wind farms. The
fund will start with initial capital of 1.5 billion yen ($19
million) as early as October and will expand to about 20 billion
yen, Chief Executive Officer Shuhei Abe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
