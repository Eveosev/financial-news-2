Al Armendariz, who resigned from the Environmental Protection Agency after
comments surfaced in which he joked he wanted to  crucify corporate polluters ,
has a new job with the Sierra Club. The San Francisco-based environmental group said today Armendariz will be a
senior campaign representative in Austin, Texas, for its “Beyond Coal”
campaign. The effort seeks to push U.S. electrical generation away from coal, a major
contributor to the industrial carbon dioxide emissions that are driving climate
change, and toward cleaner sources of power. “This is an exciting day for clean energy and public health supporters in
Texas,” said Bruce Nilles, Senior Campaign Director for Beyond Coal campaign, in
an e mailed statement. Nilles said Armendariz has “worked closely” with the group previously as an
environmental scientist and professor. In the videotaped remarks from a meeting in Dish, Texas, Armendariz told
staff members enforcing environmental laws to follow the example of the Romans,
who would subdue Turkish towns by crucifying the first five people they ran
across. “And then you know that town was really easy to manage for the next few
years,” he said. Armendariz, who apologized for the comments, said he tried to use the same
approach to get companies to obey environmental laws. Visit  www.bloomberg.com/sustainability  for the latest
