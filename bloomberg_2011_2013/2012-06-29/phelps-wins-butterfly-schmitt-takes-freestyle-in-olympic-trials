Michael Phelps  won the 200-meter
butterfly, while training partner Allison Schmitt broke her own
national record in the 200-meter freestyle to earn spots on the
U.S. swimming team at the London Olympics.  Phelps, 26, covered the distance in 1 minute, 53.65 seconds,
ahead of Tyler Clary’s time of 1:55.12 at the trials last night
in Omaha,  Nebraska .  “The last 25 meters are pretty painful,” Phelps said. “I
just wanted to get to the wall and secure another spot on the
team.”  Phelps also has earned places on the U.S. swimming team at
the Olympics in the 200-meter freestyle and the 400-meter
individual medley.  Schmitt set a U.S. record of 1:54.40 in the 200-meter
freestyle. Missy Franklin was second at 1:56.79.  “I didn’t feel like I was on my record pace, but I could
hear the crowd,” Schmitt said. “And when I touched and saw the
flames go off I was pretty excited before I even looked up and
saw the time.”  Caitlin Leverenz won the 200-meter individual medley with a
time of 2:10.22. Ariana Kukors came in second at 2:11.30 for a
place on the U.S. team.  Today’s finals are the men’s 200-meter breaststroke and
100-meter freestyle, and the women’s 200-meter butterfly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
