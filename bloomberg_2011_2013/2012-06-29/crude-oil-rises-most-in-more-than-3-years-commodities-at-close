The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities jumped 5.4 percent to 598.39 at 3:30 p.m.  New

leaders reached an agreement to ease repayment rules for Spanish
banks and relax conditions on help for  Italy .  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials rose 4.1
percent to 1,486.717.  CRUDE OIL  Oil gained the most in more than three years on the
European agreement.  Futures rose 9.4 percent, trimming the biggest quarterly
decline since the final three months of 2008, as leaders of the
17 euro countries dropped requirements that taxpayers get
preferred creditor status on aid to Spain’s banks. Prices also
increased because a European Union ban on the purchase,
transport, financing and insurance of  Iran ’s oil starts in July.  Oil for August delivery climbed $7.27 to $84.96 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the biggest one-day rally

to $97.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline surged the most since October on the European
agreement, alleviating concern that the region’s debt crisis
will spread and curb fuel demand. The dollar fell the most
against the euro since October, increasing the investment appeal
of commodities.  Gasoline and heating oil contracts for July delivery

cents, or 6.4 percent, to $2.7099 a gallon.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures rose to the highest level since
January, capping a third consecutive monthly gain, on forecasts
of above-normal temperatures that signal increased demand for
the power-plant fuel.  Gas gained 3.8 percent as MDA EarthSat Weather in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted hotter-than-normal weather
across most of the eastern and central U.S. through July 8. U.S.
cooling demand may be 13 percent above normal through July 9,
according to Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri .  Natural gas for August delivery rose 10.2 cents to $2.824
per million British thermal units on the Nymex, the highest
settlement price since Jan. 10.  BASE METALS  Copper posted the biggest gain in almost seven months on
speculation the European agreement will help contain the
region’s debt crisis, easing concern that economic growth and
metals demand will ebb, and as the dollar fell against the euro.  Copper futures for September delivery climbed 5 percent to

was the biggest since Nov. 30.  Zinc, aluminum, lead, nickel and tin all gained on the

weeks on speculation that a jump in U.S. feed costs will
discourage herd expansion. Hogs also gained.  Corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed, surged 23
percent in the two weeks through yesterday as hot, dry weather
threatened to cut U.S. yields. As of June 23, U.S. meatpackers

since May 7.  Hog futures for August settlement advanced 0.9 percent to
94.775 cents a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn prices rose, capping the biggest weekly rally since
2008, after inventories tumbled the most in 16 years, and hot,
dry weather eroded prospects for crops in the U.S., the world’s
biggest producer and exporter.  Stockpiles as of June 1 tumbled 48 percent to 3.149 billion
bushels (80 million metric tons) from March 1, the biggest drop
for the three-month period since 1996, data from the  U.S.

region from  Nebraska  to  Ohio  faced unusually dry conditions to
extreme drought, according to the government.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to
