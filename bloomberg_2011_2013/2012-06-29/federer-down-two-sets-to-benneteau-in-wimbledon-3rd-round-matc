Six-time Wimbledon champion  Roger
Federer  is down two sets to 29th seed Julien Benneteau of France
in their third-round match at the All England Club.  Benneteau leads the Swiss player 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) under a
closed roof on Centre Court. A loss today for Federer would be
his earliest in a major since the 2004 French Open, when he lost
to Gustavo Keurten in the third round.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
