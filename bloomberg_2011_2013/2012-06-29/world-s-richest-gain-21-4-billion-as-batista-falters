The world’s richest people added a
combined $21.4 billion to their collective net worth this week
as the wealth gap between billionaire  Carlos Slim  and Eike
Batista widened to more than $50 billion.  Batista’s net worth fell $4 billion. Shares of the tycoon’s
commodities empire plunged after his oil company, OGX Petroleo &
Gas Participacoes SA, cut its production targets by as much as
75 percent on June 27. Batista, 55, is now worth $20.5 billion
and ranks 23rd on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily
measure of the wealthiest people on Earth.  Global markets surged Friday after European leaders reached
an agreement that eased concern banks will fail, erasing losses
sustained by some billionaires earlier in the week. Stocks and
the euro surged the most this year, and oil had its biggest gain
since 2009.  “The fact that European leaders convened until four in the
morning convinced investors that they are committed to some kind
of a workable solution,” said  Jack Ablin , who helps oversee $60
billion at BMO Harris Private Bank in Chicago. “They know it’s
not going to be easy to keep their leaky boat afloat.”  Leaders of the 17 euro countries dropped requirements that
taxpayers get preferred creditor status on aid to Spain’s banks
and opened the way to recapitalize lenders directly, while
relaxing conditions on potential help for Italy.  The S&P 500 gained 2.03 percent during the week to close at
1362.16 in New York June 29. The Stoxx 600 Index climbed 1.86
percent during the week, closing at 251.17.  Slim, Buffett  Carlos Slim, 72, remains the world’s richest person with a
net worth of $72.5 billion. The telecommunications tycoon gained
$3.4 billion as shares of Mexico City-based Grupo Financiero
Inbursa SAB rose 3.34 percent. Slim’s America Movil SAB
succeeded in amassing the 28 percent stake it sought in Royal
KPN NV, the former Dutch phone monopoly.  Bill Gates  is $10.1 billion behind Slim. The 56-year-old
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder’s fortune gained $1.1 billion. Shares
of the Redmond, Washington-based company lost 0.36 percent. He
is worth $62.4 billion.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B)  chairman Warren Buffett, 82, ranks
third on the index with a net worth of $46.5 billion. His
fortune is up 8.8 percent this year.  Europe’s Richest  Amancio Ortega , the 76-year-old founder of Zara clothing
chain owner  Inditex SA (ITX) , is Europe’s richest man. The Spaniard’s
fortune rose $2.5 billion as shares of Inditex, the world’s
largest clothing retailer, gained 6.03 percent during the week.
He is worth $42.8 billion.  In Europe, Ortega is ahead of Swedish billionaires  Ingvar
Kamprad , the founder of the IKEA furniture chain, and Stefan
Persson, the chairman of clothing retailer  Hennes & Mauritz AB. (HMB)   Richest man in Asia is  Li Ka-Shing , who ranks 15th on the
index with a net worth of $22.9 billion. Shares of the
billionaire’s  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1)  rose 3.56 percent during
the week in Hong Kong.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
every business day at 5:30 p.m. in New York and listed in U.S.
dollars. --With assistance from Alexander Cuadros in Sao Paulo.
