Miami Heat forward  Chris Bosh  will
not be able to play for the U.S. basketball team at the London
Olympics, the latest National Basketball Association player to
drop out of contention for the squad because of injury.  Bosh strained an abdominal muscle during the NBA playoffs.
He joins Miami teammate  Dwyane Wade , Derrick Rose of the Chicago
Bulls and Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic on the sidelines,
USA Basketball said today in a statement.  “It is obvious why we have built a pool of players over
the last seven years to take care of situations like these,”
U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “This opens up opportunities
for other players in the pool to show their talents.”  Bosh was a member of the U.S. team that won a gold medal at
the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Tryouts for the team are July 5-7 in
 Las Vegas .   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
