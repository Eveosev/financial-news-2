China’s central bank said growth in
the world’s second-largest economy is within a “targeted zone”
and reiterated that it will fine-tune policy to ensure stable
credit expansion.  The  yuan ’s exchange rate will remain “basically stable”
and there are “relatively large uncertainties” in the global
economy because of Europe’s debt crisis, the People’s Bank of
China said today in a statement on its website summarizing a
second-quarter meeting of the monetary policy committee.  Policy makers including PBOC Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  are
trying to maintain economic growth that may have decelerated for
a sixth straight quarter as Europe’s turmoil crimps exports and
domestic property restrictions curb the housing market. The
central bank cut benchmark interest rates this month for the
first time since 2008.  The PBOC said it will keep implementing a “prudent”
monetary policy, enhance two-way flexibility of the yuan
 exchange rate  and “steadily promote interest-rate
liberalization.”  --Zhou Xin. Editors: Scott Lanman, Nerys Avery  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
