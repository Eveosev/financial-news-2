Tottenham Hotspur defender Vedran
Corluka will leave the Premier League club to join  Lokomotiv
Moscow .  Tottenham didn’t disclose financial terms of the move in a
statement on its website. The  Daily Mail  reported the Croatian
national team member has signed a three-year deal with the
Russian club.  The moves reunites Corluka with Slaven Bilic, who stepped
down as Croatia manager following his team’s elimination from
the European Championship to take over at Lokomotiv.  The 26-year-old joined Tottenham from Manchester City in
2008 and spent part of last season on loan at Bayer Leverkusen.
He made 110 appearances for Spurs, scoring one goal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
