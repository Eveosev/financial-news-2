Akenerji Elektrik Uretim AS (AKENR) , a
Turkish utility, surged the most in almost a year after saying
it would sell 45 percent of a special purpose vehicle to its
partners.  The shares jumped 9.8 percent to 2.12 liras, the biggest
rise on a closing basis since August 2011, paring its second-
quarter decline to 1.9 percent. The SPV is Akcez Enerji
Yatirimlari Sanayi & Ticaret AS, which was set up to buy the
Sedas electricity distribution grid in northwestern Turkey.  Akenerji, owned by  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and the Akkok Group, will sell a
22.5 percent stake to CEZ and another 22.5 percent to Akkok
Sanayi Yatirim & Gelistirme AS at a price to be determined after
a report on the unit’s valuation, the company said in a
statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the market closed
yesterday.  The transaction lowers Akenerji’s indebtedness and paves
the way for other electricity generation investments, according
to an e-mailed report from Istanbul-based brokerage Oyak
Securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
