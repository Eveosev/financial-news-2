Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) , the first
company to win approval to export natural gas from the
continental U.S., plans to complete as much as $4 billion in
financing for the project in the next few days.  “We’re working with our eight lead arrangers to secure the
 project financing  and it will be announced in the next few
days,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charif Souki said
in a phone interview today.  Cheniere said on June 4 it expected to complete debt
financing arrangements by the end of this month for the
estimated $4.5 billion to $5 billion it needs to build
liquefaction units at its Sabine Pass facility in  Louisiana . The
company hired JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and others in
April to help arrange the funding.  “More than likely, they’ll get the debt financing done,”
William Frohnhoefer, an analyst at BTIG LLC, said in a June 26
phone interview. “If they are late a few days, it won’t have a
significant impact on their work schedule or costs.”  Investors have already “priced in” a possible delay and
that’s reflected in the stock price, said Frohnhoefer, who rates
the stock a buy. Cheniere rose 7.1 percent to $14.74 at the
close in  New York . The shares have gained 70 percent  this year .  Korea Gas Corp., BG Group Plc, Gas Natural SDG SA and Gail
India Ltd. have agreed to buy a combined 16 million tons a year
from the Sabine Pass terminal, according to the company.  LNG is gas chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus
162 Celsius) so it can be transported by ship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
