Spot gasoline in the U.S. Pacific
Northwest gained against futures for a second day after trading
began for July delivery and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  shut a boiler
at the Anacortes refinery in  Washington  for repairs.  Prompt-delivery contracts for conventional, 87-octane
gasoline in Portland,  Oregon , switched to July and are now
trading against August gasoline futures on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. July Nymex futures traded 9.54 cents above
the August contract today.  Shell shut the No. 1 boiler at the 147,500-barrel-a-day
Anacortes refinery on June 25 for 10 days of repairs after a
tube leak, The Hague-based company said in a notice to the
Northwest Clean Air Agency. The No. 2 boiler, connected to a
catalytic cracking unit at the refinery, is “operating but
leaking,” Shell said in the filing.  The premium to August futures for gasoline in  Portland , a
benchmark for the U.S. Northwest, was 4 cents a gallon compared
with yesterday’s 5.5-cent-a-gallon discount to July, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt-delivery of the fuel rose
11.26 cents to $2.6718 a gallon.  Emily Oberton, a Shell spokeswoman in Houston, declined in
an e-mail to comment on the boiler leaks at the Anacortes plant.  Low-sulfur diesel in Portland weakened 1.5 cents to 10
cents a gallon above Nymex heating oil futures.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in  Los Angeles 
slipped 1 cent to 8 cents a gallon above gasoline futures. The
same fuel in San Francisco dropped 1.5 cents to 7.5 cents a
gallon over futures.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles gained
0.25 cent to a premium of 4.75 cents a gallon against heating
oil futures.  San Francisco  CARB diesel rose 0.5 cent to 0.5 cent
above futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
