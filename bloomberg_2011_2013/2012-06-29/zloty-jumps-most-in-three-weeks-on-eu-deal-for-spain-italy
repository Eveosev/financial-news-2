The Polish zloty rallied the most in
three weeks, rebounding from two days of decline after European
leaders reached an agreement that alleviated concern banks will
fail.  The zloty jumped 1.5 percent to 4.2294 versus the euro as
of 5:12 p.m. in Warsaw, its steepest appreciation since June 7.
It had the second-biggest rally among emerging-market currencies
in June to pare this quarter’s loss to 1.8 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  After talks ended at 4:30 a.m. in Brussels today, leaders
of the 17 euro countries dropped requirements that taxpayers get
preferred creditor status on aid to  Spain ’s banks and opened the
way to recapitalize lenders directly. Euro area is  Poland ’s
biggest trading partner.  “The zloty is gaining on the back of euphoria following
the summit in Brussels,”  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  analysts in Warsaw wrote
in an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
