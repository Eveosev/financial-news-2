Unilever Plc plans to switch part of
its production to  Greece , as use of local materials will result
in competitive products,  Kathimerini  reported, without citing
anyone.  The company, which already makes some products, including
ice-cream, in Greece, will move operations from other businesses
such as laundry detergents and cosmetics from France, Italy and
possibly Germany, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
