Hong Kong  stocks  rose the most in
two weeks after European leaders surprised investors with a deal
easing rules for emergency loans to Spanish banks and making it
easier to recapitalize the region’s troubled lenders.  Shares also advanced on speculation President  Hu Jintao 
will offer measures to boost Hong Kong’s economy during a three-
day visit starting today to mark the 15th anniversary of the
city’s return to Chinese rule.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , a port
operator that gets about half its sales in Europe, added 2.3
percent.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (388)  Ltd. gained 2.9 percent
after saying it will develop derivative products with mainland
bourses.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 2.2 percent to 19,441.46 at the
close, the biggest gain since June 15. All but one stock rose on
the 49-member gauge, which pared its quarterly decline to 5.3
percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
stocks advanced 2.6 percent to 9,574.84 today.  “News on  Spain  is what we wanted to hear from the
summit,” said Francis Lun, managing director at Lyncean
Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-based brokerage. “Obviously the
market is jubilant.”  The  Hang Seng benchmark index  has fallen about 10 percent
from this year’s peak in February amid concern economic growth
is slowing in the U.S. and China as Europe’s crisis spreads.
Companies on the gauge traded at 10.1 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 12.8 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 10.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Summit Deal  Euro-area leaders meeting at a summit in Brussels agreed to
ease repayment rules for emergency loans to Spanish banks after
the first day of the summit. Leaders dropped the requirement
that governments get preferred creditor status on crisis loans
to Spain’s blighted banks, European Union President  Herman Van
Rompuy  said. Banks can also be recapitalized directly with funds
rather than going through governments, he said.  Stocks that do business in Europe rose. Hutchison Whampoa
gained 2.3 percent to HK$66.50.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which
operates a port in Greece advanced 5.3 percent to HK$10.50.
 Standard Chartered Plc (2888) , a London-based bank, added 3.5 percent
to HK$169.80.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing gained 2.9 percent to HK$110
after announcing a joint venture yesterday to develop cross-
border indexes and products with Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges. The partners will each invest HK$100 million ($12.9
million) in the new company, to be established within three
months of yesterday’s signing of the agreement.  Hang Seng Index futures climbed 2.4 percent to 19,449. The
 HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  fell 8.2 percent to 20.4, indicating
traders expect a swing of about 5.8 percent in the benchmark
index during the next 30 days. The measure of volatility fell to
its lowest level since May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
