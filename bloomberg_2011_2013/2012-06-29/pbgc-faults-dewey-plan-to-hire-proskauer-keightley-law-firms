The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.,
Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP’s largest unsecured creditor, faulted the
defunct  law firm  for a plan to hire Proskauer Rose LLP and
Keightley & Ashner LLP at a cost of $610,000 in the first nine
weeks.  The two firms’ work “to date has been unnecessary, has not
affected or benefited the bankruptcy estate, and has been
duplicative of each other’s work,” the PBGC said in a filing in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan today. Dewey, which owes
secured lenders more than $225 million, has asked a judge to
approve the hiring of around 11 firms to help it liquidate,
according to filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
