President  Barack Obama  declared
Colorado a federal disaster area, triggering federal funds to
help fight High Park and Waldo Canyon fires near Colorado
Springs, the stateâ€™s second-largest city.  The announcement, released by the White House shortly after
midnight, came as the president prepared to assess damage today
with state and local officials, who describe it as the worst in
state history.  One person was found dead, Police Chief Pete Carey said,
the  Associated Press  reported.  The declaration makes federal funding available in two
counties, El Paso and Larimer, that have been scorched by the
High Park and Waldo Canyon fires. Money is also available for
crisis counseling and unemployment assistance, according to a
White House statement.  The Waldo Canyon blaze outside  Colorado Springs , in its
seventh day, has turned at least 346 homes into ashes. About
32,000 people have evacuated their residences as fires charred
18,500 acres. Flames may not be contained until July 16,
according an estimate on the Incident Information System, a
federal interagency website that tracks disasters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
