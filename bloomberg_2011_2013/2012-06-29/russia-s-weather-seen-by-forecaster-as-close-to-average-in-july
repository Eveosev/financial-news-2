Russia ’s weather conditions will be
close to average during July, the Federal Hydrometeorology and
Environmental Monitoring Service said.  Temperatures will be about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees
Fahrenheit) higher than average next month in the regions which
grow the most grain, the service said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The average temperature will be about 24 degrees Celsius in
Rostov and Krasnodar, in the Southern federal district, and
above 22 degrees Celsius in Stavropol, in the North-Caucasus
federal district, in July. Rainfall for the month is expected to
be 10 percent to 15 percent below average in these areas.  Rostov, Krasnodar and Stavropol harvested 29 percent of
Russia’s grain crops, or 27.3 million metric tons, in 2011,
making them the country’s biggest growing regions, according to
state statistics data.  Precipitation will be 10 percent to 30 percent below
average across regions in the Siberian federal district, the
service said. Almost 16 percent of the national crop, or 14.6
million tons, was grown in the area last year, state statistics
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
