The following is the text of the
industrial product and raw material prices report as reported
by  Statistics Canada .  In May, the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) was
unchanged from April. Price increases for motor vehicles and
other transportation equipment (+1.0%) and lumber and other wood
products (+1.7%) were offset mainly by a 2.1% decline in
petroleum and coal products. The Raw Materials Price Index
(RMPI) fell 1.0%, largely because of lower prices for crude oil.  Industrial Product Price Index, monthly change  Of the 21 major commodity groups, 11 were up, 6 were down,
and 4 were unchanged.  Motor vehicles and other transportation equipment (+1.0%)
and lumber and other wood products (+1.7%) were among the
product groups that experienced growth. More modest advances
were observed in pulp and paper products (+0.7%) and machinery
and equipment (+0.5%).  The motor vehicles and other transportation equipment group
was pushed upward by an increase in prices for motor vehicles
(+1.6%), which rose for the first time in six months. The
decline in the value of the Canadian dollar against the US
dollar was partly responsible for the May increase in motor
vehicle prices.  Softwood lumber (+3.9%) was the leading factor in the
increase in lumber and other wood products. These prices rose in
conjunction with the demand for building permits for houses and
apartment buildings in the  United States , which reached its
highest level in May in over three years.  Some Canadian producers who export their products are
generally paid on the basis of prices set in US dollars.
Consequently, the 1.7% depreciation of the Canadian dollar in
relation to the US dollar in May had the effect of increasing
the corresponding prices in Canadian dollars. Without the impact
of the exchange rate, the IPPI would have fallen 0.4% instead of
being unchanged.  Conversely, the decline in petroleum and coal products was
mainly attributable to a 3.6% decrease in gasoline prices, which
were down for the first time since the beginning of the year.  Among the other product groups that declined were primary
metals (-1.3%), which posted a third consecutive decrease. The
largest contributor to the decline was other non-ferrous metal
products (-3.7%), particularly precious metal basic manufactured
shapes (-11.9%). Also down were nickel products (-3.3%),
aluminum products (-0.6%) and copper and copper alloy products
(-0.6%).  The IPPI excluding petroleum and coal products rose 0.2% in
May.  12-month change in the Industrial Product Price Index  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the IPPI was
up 0.7% in May. This is a deviation from the trend of
decelerating growth observed in recent months. Between September
2011 and April 2012, the year-over-year growth rate of the index
fell from 5.6% to 0.5%.  The IPPI was pushed upward mainly by higher prices for
motor vehicles and other transportation equipment (+3.0%),
particularly motor vehicles (+4.0%).  More modest increases were seen in lumber and other wood
products (+5.9%), particularly softwood lumber (+13.1%). Fruit,
vegetables, feeds and other food products (+2.1%) and machinery
and equipment (+3.2%) also contributed to the increase.  Compared with May 2011, the advance of the IPPI was
moderated largely by primary metal products (-7.5%), which
posted a seventh consecutive decline. There was also a decrease
in petroleum and coal products (-0.9%), the first since 2009.  The 4.1% year-over-year decline in the value of the
Canadian dollar against the US dollar contributed to the advance
of the index. Without the impact of the exchange rate, the IPPI
would have fallen 0.3% instead of increasing 0.7%.  The IPPI excluding petroleum and coal products was up 0.8%
from May 2011.  Raw Materials Price Index, monthly change  The RMPI posted its fourth straight decline in May, falling
1.0%. All major product groups except one were down. Previously,
the index had experienced decreases of 1.6% in March and 2.0% in
April.  The RMPIâ€™s decline was mostly due to mineral fuels (-2.1%),
particularly crude oil (-2.2%). More modest downward pressure
was exerted on the index by vegetable products (-0.7%) and non-
ferrous metals (-0.2%).  The main factors in the decrease in vegetable products were
oilseeds (-1.4%), unrefined sugar (-9.7%) and natural rubber and
allied gums (-3.6%). In the oilseeds group, soybeans (-4.8%) and
canola (-1.5%) were down for the first time since the beginning
of 2012.  Non-ferrous metals were pushed down largely by precious
metals (-3.1%), especially silver and platinum (-5.9%). Other
contributors to the decrease in this commodity group were nickel
concentrates (-3.2%) and copper concentrates (-0.4%). The
decline in nickel prices was attributable in part to weaker
demand for steel.  The only product group to post an advance in May was wood
(+2.1%), mostly because of higher prices for logs and bolts
(+2.5%).  The RMPI excluding mineral fuels edged down 0.1%.  12-month change in the Raw Materials Price Index  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the RMPI was
down 9.9%, its third consecutive decrease. However, the decline
was smaller than in April, when the index fell 13.6%.  The index was pulled downward primarily by mineral fuels (-
15.9%), specifically crude oil (-16.1%). Also contributing to
the decline were non-ferrous metals (-10.0%), particularly
copper concentrates (-12.8%) and nickel concentrates (-28.7%).  The only commodity group to post an increase relative to
the same month last year was animal and animal products (+2.1%).
Higher prices for slaughter cattle (+9.1%) and slaughter calves
(+7.3%) were the main factors in the advance.  Year over year, the RMPI excluding mineral fuels was down
3.9%.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months (for
example, when the July index is released, the index for the
previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product  Price Index  (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave the
plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike
the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and
all the costs that occur between the time a good leaves the
plant and the time the final user takes possession of it,
including transportation, wholesale and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate
their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars,
which are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular,
this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp, paper and wood
products. Therefore, a rise or fall in the value of the Canadian
dollar against its US counterpart affects the IPPI. But the
conversion into Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents
provide their prices. Moreover, this is not a measure that takes
into account the full effect of exchange rates, since that is a
more difficult analytical task.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on
the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot rate) established
by the  Bank of Canada  and is available on CANSIM in table 176-
0064 (series v37426). Monthly and annual variations in the
exchange rate, as described in the text, are calculated
according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for
example, CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the prices
paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of
those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices
are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into
Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of
the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
