Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  of Austria rose
the most in five months, leading Czech shares higher, after the
European Union moved closer to containing its financial crisis.  The stock climbed 6.7 percent to 381 koruna at the close of
trading in  Prague , the steepest gain since Jan. 26, paring its
losses this quarter to 11 percent. The  PX (PX)  index of 14 equities,
in which Erste has a 20 percent weighting, added 2.3 percent
today, also the most in five months, to 900.90.  Banks and mining companies led European shares higher as
oil and Spanish bonds rallied after leaders reached an agreement
that opened the way to bank recapitalization in Spain, easing
concern that the debt crisis will spread through the continent.
The meeting, which continues today, approved a 120 billion-euro
($151 billion) plan to promote growth in the EU.  “The long-awaited summit is evolving surprisingly well”
after “politicians damped markets’ expectations in the past
days,” Tomas Mencik, a stock analyst at Cyrrus AS brokerage in
Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in an e-mail to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
