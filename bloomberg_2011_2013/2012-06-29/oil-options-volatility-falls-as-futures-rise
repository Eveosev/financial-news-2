Crude-oil options volatility slipped
as underlying futures surged the most in 16 months after a
European accord relieved concern that banks would fail and the
region would sink further into debt.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30.97 percent at 1:25 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 32 percent yesterday.  “You have the higher price, volatility is coming off and
we’re back up in the range we were before,” said Fred Rigolini,
vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for August delivery rose $6.15, or 7.9 percent,
to $83.84 a barrel at 1:28 p.m. on the Nymex.  Leaders of the 17 euro countries dropped requirements that
taxpayers get preferred creditor status on aid to  Spain ’s banks
and opened the way to recapitalize lenders directly. The
region’s debt crisis has erased more than $4.9 trillion from
global equity values this quarter amid concern  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis would slow the global recovery.  Rigolini said traders were buying August $70 puts and
August $90 calls and August and December straddles, where they
bought a put and a call at the same price, betting on a large
movement in either direction.  “You’re long a call and a put because you believe things
are not going to be at this price very long and will either go a
lot higher or a lot lower,” Rigolini said.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were August $70 puts, which fell 27 cents to 5 cents a barrel at
1:30 p.m. with 4,963 lots trading. August $90 calls were the
second-most active options, with 3,802 lots changing hands as
they rose 40 cents to 46 cents.  Calls accounted for 60 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish bets accounted for 52 percent of the 129,453
contracts traded in the previous session. August $70 puts were
the most actively traded, with 7,143 lots changing hands. They
rose 18 cents to 32 cents. The next-most active options, August
$75 puts, advanced 61 cents to $1.25 on volume of 6,728.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 44,819
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 39,444 lots and
December $70 puts with 38,043.  To contact the reporter on this story:
