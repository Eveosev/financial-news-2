India ’s 10-year government  bonds 
completed a second weekly loss as the central bank refrained
from purchasing debt.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has bought 545.8 billion rupees
($9.8 billion) of government notes so far this fiscal year that
began April 1, according to its own data. The  finance ministry 
sold 150 billion rupees of securities due in 2017, 2022, 2030
and 2036 today, according to the RBI, part of the government’s
record 5.7 trillion rupees annual borrowing program. The
benchmark 10-year yield fell the most this quarter since 2008
after the monetary authority cut the repurchase  rate  by 50 basis
points to 8 percent in April to bolster growth.  “The lack of debt buying by the RBI has damped appetite,”
said R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer of currencies and
fixed-income at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur. “Bonds will be
under pressure without support from open-market auctions given
the large borrowing plan.”  The yield on the government’s 8.15 percent notes due June
2022 rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, this week
to 8.18 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The rate rose five basis points today. The
benchmark 10-year yield declined 36 basis points this quarter,
the most since the final three months of 2008.  Gross domestic product increased 5.3 percent in the three
months through March, the least in nine years, according to
government data.  The wholesale-price index climbed 7.55 percent in May from
a year earlier, compared with 7.23 percent in April, according
to commerce ministry data. India is likely to face elevated
 inflation  risks from supply bottlenecks, the central bank said
in its Financial Stability Report released yesterday.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose four basis
points this week to 7.81 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The rate rose three basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
