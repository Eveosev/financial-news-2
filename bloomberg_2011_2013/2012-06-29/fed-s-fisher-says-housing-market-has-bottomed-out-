President  Richard Fisher  said he believes low mortgage rates
have helped bring an end to the slump in U.S. housing.  “I do think the housing market has bottomed out,” Fisher
said to reporters today in Aspen, Colorado. The improvement has
been “assisted by these low mortgage rates that we’ve had.”  More Americans than forecast signed contracts to purchase
previously owned homes in May, indicating the real estate
industry is firming three years after the start of the economic
recovery. The index of pending home resales climbed 5.9 percent
to 101.1, matching a two-year high reached in March, after a 5.5
percent decline in April, according to figures from the National
Association released yesterday.  Record-low  mortgage rates  and cheaper properties may keep
sparking buyer interest, even as cooling employment and limited
access to credit remain hurdles for the market. The Fed’s
decision last week to extend a program aimed at holding down
borrowing costs may sustain the progress in residential real
estate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
