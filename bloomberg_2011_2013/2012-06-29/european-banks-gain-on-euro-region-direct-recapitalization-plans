European banking stocks  surged on
speculation an agreement by euro-area leaders that will allow
banks to tap emergency money from the currency union’s rescue
funds will stabilize financial markets.  The Bloomberg  Europe  Banks and Financial Services Index
rose 3 percent at 10 a.m. Frankfurt time. Spanish banks led the
increase, with  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  and  Bankia SA (BKIA) 
jumping 6 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively.  The leaders of the 17 euro countries opened the door to
recapitalizing banks with bailout funds rather than the rescue
mechanisms of individual  member states  once Europe sets up a
single banking supervisor. That may speed access to funds for
troubled banks and improves the environment for their peers in
more fiscally healthy nations, said Michael Seufert, an analyst
at Norddeutsche Landesbank in Hanover,  Germany .  “There’s a lot of relief that we’re moving toward a
situation of stability for the financial sector,” said Seufert.
“The probability that banks will get the aid they might need in
a timely fashion is now higher.”  European leaders, who held 13 1/2 hours of talks ending at
4:30 a.m. in Brussels today, also dropped the requirement that
governments get preferred creditor status on crisis loans to
 Spain ’s blighted banks.  Today’s rally may only last for the short term, as “the
agreement still doesn’t solve the euro area’s problems,”
Seufert said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
