Turkey  has sent anti-aircraft guns
and vehicles equipped with Stinger surface-to-air missiles to
its border with  Syria  following Syriaâ€™s downing of a Turkish jet,
 Hurriyet newspaper  said.  As part of the new rules of military engagement following
the incident on June 22, Turkey will no longer tolerate even
brief violations of its airspace, the Istanbul-based newspaper
said citing unidentified military officials.  Violations from Syria will be immediately perceived as
hostile and violators fired upon without warning, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
