The proportion of Colombians with a
favorable image of President  Juan Manuel Santos  slumped to 48
percent in June from 64 percent in April, according to a poll by
Gallup  Colombia  published on Caracol Radio’s  website  today.  The survey was conducted between June 21 and 27 amid a
scandal that caused Justice Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra to
resign after lawmakers amended legislation reforming the justice
system in a way which could have paralyzed investigations into
politicians with links to illegal armed groups. Congress today
voted to drop the reform.  Gallup interviewed 1,200 citizens in Colombia’s five
biggest cities by telephone. The poll has a margin of error of
plus or minus three percentage points, Caracol said.  Dozens of lawmakers, including the cousin of former
President  Alvaro Uribe , have been removed from office or jailed
in recent years for allegedly conspiring with illegal
paramilitary groups, which funded their war on the country’s
Marxist rebels by cocaine trafficking and extortion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
