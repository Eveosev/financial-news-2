The euro’s share of global foreign-
exchange reserves fell from January through March to the lowest
level since the third quarter of 2006, International Monetary
Fund data show.  The shared currency’s percentage declined to 24.95 percent,
from 25.03 percent in the previous three months, according to
the quarterly data. The dollar’s portion of official reserves
shrank to 62.2 percent in the first quarter, from 62.22 percent
in fourth-quarter 2011. Sterling had the biggest gain, climbing
to 4 percent, from 3.83 percent at the end of 2011, the most
since the second quarter of 2011.  The yen’s share was 3.55 percent in the first quarter, an
increase from 3.53 percent from the previous three months, and
central banks increased their holdings of Swiss francs by 0.01
percentage point to 0.12 percent.  The category of “other currencies” shrank for the first
quarter since the start of 2009, to 5.17 percent, according to
the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
