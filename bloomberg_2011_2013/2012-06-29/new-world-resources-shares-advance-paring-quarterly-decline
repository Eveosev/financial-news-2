New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal jumped, paring its quarterly drop,
as commodities rallied on optimism that the European Union will
contain its debt crisis and economic slowdown.  The stock rose 3.4 percent to 101.3 koruna by 10:07 a.m. in
 Prague , erasing losses earlier this week. NWR still stood down
24 percent since the end of March and 25 percent down this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
