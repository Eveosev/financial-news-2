Laurentian Bank of Canada , the
country’s seventh-biggest lender, said it hired former
Wellington West Capital dealmakers Kevin Hooke and Tyler Wirvin
to expand its  investment banking  business to Winnipeg, Manitoba.  Hooke has more than 30 years experience and was a founding
partner, director and head of investment banking at Wellington
West, the Montreal-based firm said today in a statement.
Laurentian’s Montreal-based rival,  National Bank of Canada (NA) ,
bought Wellington West Holdings Inc. in July.  Wirvin has 10 years experience including at the Province of
Manitoba’s debt capital markets department, Laurentian said.
Both start July 3.  “We are expanding into Manitoba as we believe the growth
prospects and solid economic foundation of mid-Western Canada
provide a good backdrop for our future growth while having a
local presence will prove to be a competitive advantage,”
Michel Trudeau, chief executive officer of  Laurentian Bank 
Securities, said.  The firm also said it hired Milla Craig as a consultant and
special adviser to its equity group in Toronto, and Laila
Danechi as an institutional equity sales representative in
 Montreal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
