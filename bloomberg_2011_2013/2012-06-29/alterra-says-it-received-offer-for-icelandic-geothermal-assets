Alterra Power Corp. (AXY)  said it received
an unsolicited offer from a closely-held entity in Iceland for
the purchase of its geothermal assets in the nation.  The Vancouver-based company said it signed a non-binding
agreement to pursue the transaction, which would require
approvals from the Icelandic government. The decision regards
Alterraâ€™s 66.6 percent stake in HS Orka hf, which is 33.4
percent owned by a syndicate of Icelandic pension funds,
according to a statement from Alterra released today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
