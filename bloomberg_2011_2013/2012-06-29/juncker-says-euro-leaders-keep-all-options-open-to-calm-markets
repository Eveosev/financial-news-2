Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker, who heads the group of euro-area finance
ministers, said euro leaders agreed on “short-term measures”
to aid Spain and  Italy .  “We will keep all options open to make the interventions
that need to be done to calm the situation,” Juncker told
reporters in Brussels today after the first day of a European
Union summit. “We will conclude this in definite tomorrow
morning. We made significant progress.”  Euro leaders “didn’t close any doors” on short-term
measures to calm markets, he said. “The financial markets are
confronted with a situation where everything is possible. I
don’t want to prioritize one option, nor do I want to rule out
an option. Everything is possible.”  Juncker said the measures will be discussed in the coming
weeks and euro-area finance chiefs should reach final agreement
on July 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
