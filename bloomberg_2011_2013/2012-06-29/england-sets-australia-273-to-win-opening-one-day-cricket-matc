England set Australia a target of
273 to win their opening one-day cricket match at Lord’s in
London.  Eoin Morgan was 89 not out as England reached 272-5 in its
50 overs after being put in to bat. Jonathan Trott scored 54
runs, with  Ian Bell  adding 41 and Alastair Cook 40.  England would replace Australia at the top of the
 International Cricket Council ’s one-day rankings with a 5-0
sweep of the series. That would make it the first country to be
No. 1 in all three forms of the game as it currently tops the
Test and Twenty20 ratings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
