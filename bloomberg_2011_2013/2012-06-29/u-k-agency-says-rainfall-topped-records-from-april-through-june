The U.K. had record amounts of rain
from April through June, filling rivers and reservoirs and
improving groundwater conditions, the Environment Agency said.  Areas of  Wales  received 427 millimeters (17 inches) of rain
in the period and East Anglia had 268 millimeters, the agency
said in a report on its  website  dated yesterday. River and
reservoir levels across England and Wales are normal to above
normal for this time of year, while flooding “has caused
serious problems” in some parts of the country, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
