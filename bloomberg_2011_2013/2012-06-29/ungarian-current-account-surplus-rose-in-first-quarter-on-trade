Hungary’s current-account surplus
rose more than expected in the first quarter from the previous
three months as the balance on the trade of goods grew.  The surplus totaled 186 million euros ($234 million),
compared with a revised 134 million euros in the earlier three-
month period and 342 million euros a year earlier, the  Magyar
Nemzeti Bank  said today. That compares with a projection for a
120 million-euro surplus in a Bloomberg survey of nine
economists. The seasonally adjusted current-account surplus was
117 million euros, the central bank said.  Hungary’s current-account balance has been improving as the
economy recovers from a  contraction  of 6.7 percent in 2009, its
worst in 18 years, which sapped consumer demand and reduced
imports. The government expects a surplus of 4 percent of gross
domestic product in 2013, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said
on June 14.  Hungary’s net external financing capacity, or the combined
surplus of the current and capital accounts, was an adjusted 3.2
percent of GDP in the first quarter.  The country had a surplus of 1.8 billion euros in the trade
of goods and services, up from 1.5 billion euros in the previous
quarter. The surplus on the trade of goods grew to 1.2 billion
euros from 795 million euros.  Capital transfers from the European Union had a surplus of
544 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
