Yields on  Russia ’s government ruble
bonds fell the most in two weeks after the  Federal Financial
Markets Service  said it will give foreign depositaries including
Euroclear Bank SA direct access to domestic sovereign debt
markets.  Yields on so-called OFZ bonds due in 2018 fell 14 basis
points to 8.19 percent, the biggest drop since June 15. The rate
on OFZs due August 2016 fell 12 basis points to 7.95 percent.  While Russia had planned to allow the foreign depositaries
access to the market from July 1, Micex-RTS head Ruben Aganbegyan said April 23 that the markets watchdog was reviewing
the timing and conditions of the change. The regulator announced
Euroclear and others would be granted access in a statement on
its website late yesterday.  “It’s a big step forward to bringing offshore investors to
the local  bond market ,”  Denis Korshilov , head of fixed income,
currencies and commodities at Citigrup Inc. in Moscow, said by
e-mail. “The market definitely needs fresh money, given the
tight liquidity conditions which we have now. Potentially this
is good news for the currency as well.”  The ruble gained 2.1 percent to 32.43 per dollar. Urals
crude, Russia’s main export earner, jumped 1.7 percent to $92.26
per barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
