China plans to allow asset
management companies to invest in  private equity  with funds from
their special-asset management units.  The plan is meant to prompt private investment in unlisted
companies’ stocks and debt, according to a  statement  posted on
the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s website today.  The nation plans to remove allocation restrictions for
special accounts’ securities investments. The funds aren’t
currently allowed to buy a single stock exceeding 20 percent of
their planned net asset value or a single non-stock security
exceeding 10 percent.  The commission also plans to ease business supervision and
strengthen risk controls on special-asset management units. The
relaxation of the rules will help to support investment in the
real economy, the commission said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
