Roy Teo, a currency strategist in
Singapore at ABN Amro Private Bank, said euro-area leaders’
decision on Spanish loans is positive for the euro.  The 17-nation currency surged 1.2 percent to $1.2595 as of
12:34 p.m. in  Tokyo . Euro-area leaders agreed to drop the
condition that emergency loans to Spanish banks give their
governments preferred creditor status, European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy  told reporters after a summit.  Spain’s benchmark 10-year yield climbed to a euro-lifetime
high of 7.29 percent on June 18.  On Spanish bond yields, euro:  European leaders “have addressed the issues on the
seniority of Spanish loans. That should help push down Spanish
yields.  ‘‘It’s positive for the euro.’’  When European policy makers ‘‘started saying that they
would inject bailout funds into the Spanish banks, bond holders
were already worried that in an event of any haircut or default,
the money from  Europe ’s bailout fund will have a seniority
status compared to private bond holders. From that perspective,
private bond holders would demand higher yield premiums.  ‘‘So the fact that right now they are renouncing the
seniority status means private bond holders will have similar,
equal weighting in that sense. So that should reduce their
investors’ premium for investing in Spanish debt and that should
be positive for the euro.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
