International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  is wrong to press for measures that
would result in a mutualization of euro-region debt, Bavarian
Prime Minister  Horst Seehofer  said.  Shared liability for sovereign debt and a banking union, as
Lagarde urges, would remove pressure on governments to carry out
economic policy changes, Seehofer wrote in an opinion piece in
Germany’s  Handelsblatt  newspaper.  The German constitution should be changed to permit
referendums on decisions to deepen European integration and
transfer powers to European institutions, Seehofer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
