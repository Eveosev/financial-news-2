Asian  stocks  climbed, with the
regional benchmark index posting its biggest first-half gain in
three years, after European leaders meeting in Brussels agreed
to ease repayment rules for Spanish banks and make it easier to
recapitalize the region’s troubled lenders.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  rose 1.5 percent in Sydney as banks
provided the biggest support to the Asian benchmark after
leaders of the 17 euro countries dropped a requirement that
governments get preferred creditor status on crisis loans to
Spain’s banks.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  advanced 2.6 percent, leading
gains among Japanese exporters.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, climbed 2.3 percent as metals prices
soared.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  climbed 2 percent to 117.24 as
of 7:03 p.m. in Tokyo, with nine stocks rising for each that
fell. The measure was headed for its biggest weekly advance
since January, rising 2.7 percent. The gauge fell 12 percent
through yesterday from a February high amid concern growth in
China and the U.S. is slowing as Europe’s debt crisis escalates.  “It was a moment of high drama,” said  Jonathan Garner ,
Hong Kong-based chief strategist at Morgan Stanley, of the
European leaders’ decision. “France sided with Spain and Italy
and all three of those countries made it very clear they weren’t
pursuing with the long-term goals around fiscal union and or
growth measures unless one dealt with the short-term problem of
stability in the bond markets and the Spanish banks problem.”  The Asian benchmark rose 3 percent for the first six
months, the biggest first-half gain since 2009. That  compares 
with a 5.7 percent advance in 2012 by the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and a 0.1 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
through yesterday. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at
12 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times
for the  S&P 500  and 10.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  U.S. Futures  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index gained 2.2 percent and Japan’s
Nikkei 225 added 1.5 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index
climbed 1.4 percent, South Korea’s Kospi increased 1.9 percent
and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.2 percent.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said Germany’s philosophy that
financial aid must carry conditions remains in place after
European leaders eased repayment rules on emergency loans.  “Our formula hasn’t changed,” she told reporters as she
arrived for day two of the summit in Brussels. “I think we have
taken some important decisions, but we remain true to our
philosophy of no help without something in return.”  Doubts Cast  “Europe keeps making bold statements, then diluting them
shortly afterwards,”  Mark Matthews , Singapore-based head of
research Asia for Bank Julius Baer & Co., which manages $281
billion worldwide, said in an e-mail. “These are only vague
encouraging words, which have produced excitement and euphoria.
They will almost certainly be followed by denials and delays,
and confusion in the marketplace.”  Financial shares accounted for the largest gains on the
Asian regional benchmark. Westpac advanced 1.5 percent to
A$21.13. Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. climbed 2.5
percent to A$22.03.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  surged 3.9 percent to 294 yen. Japan’s
largest brokerage will cut pay for Chief Executive Officer
Kenichi Watanabe by 50 percent following the results of a probe
into  insider trading , it said in a statement after the close of
markets in Tokyo.  Exporters climbed. Toyota Motor gained 2.6 percent to 3,190
yen.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , a port operator that gets about
half its sales in the Europe, rose 2.3 percent to HK$66.50 in
Hong Kong.  BHP Billiton  rose 2.3 percent to A$31.45. Rio Tinto Group
advanced 2.4 percent to A$56.50. Copper for delivery in three
months advanced 2 percent on the London Metal Exchange.  David Jones Ltd., Australia’s second-largest department
store operator, advanced 15 percent to A$2.59 after receiving a
A$1.65 billion ($1.68 billion) offer from EB Private Equity, an
entity the retailer said gave no explanation of its capacity to
pay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
