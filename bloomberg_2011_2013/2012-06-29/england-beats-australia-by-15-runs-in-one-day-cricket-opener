England defeated Australia by 15
runs in their opening one-day cricket match at Lord’s in London.  Eoin Morgan’s unbeaten 89 led England to 272-5 in its 50
overs after the home team was put in to bat. James Anderson,
 Steve Finn , Tim Bresnan and Stuart Broad then took two wickets
each as Australia was limited to 257-9 in its chase. Captain
 Michael Clarke  top-scored for the visitors with 61.  The five-match series continues in two days at the Oval in
London.  England will replace Australia atop the International
Cricket Council’s one-day rankings by sweeping the series. That
would make it the first country to be No. 1 in all three forms
of the game as it currently tops the Test and Twenty20 ratings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
