The Nordic Investment Bank agreed to
loan 175 million Danish kroner ($30 million) to finance wind
turbines in Denmark, which is seeking to get half of its power
from  wind energy  by 2020.  The bank will loan the funds to the Danish regional bank
 Ringkjoebing Landbobank A/S (RILBA) , which in turn will make loans to
support about 60 megawatts of wind farms, according to a
 statement  on Helsinki-based NIB’s website today.  The bank is owned by Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland,
Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
