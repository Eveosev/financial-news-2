Kenya’s shilling strengthened the
most in more than a week, paring its quarterly decline, as the
central bank withdrew  money supply  for a second consecutive day
and inflation slowed.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
0.2 percent to close at 84.20 in Nairobi, the biggest gain since
June 20, trimming its depreciation in the second quarter to 1.6
percent.  Kenya tightened liquidity by accepting 3.5 billion
shillings ($41.6 million) of bids for  repurchase agreements 
maturing in seven days at a weighted average rate of 17.525
percent, a central bank official who asked not to be named in
line with policy said today. Bids received totaled 12.3 billion
shillings. The sale today is the second auction after the bank
stayed out for five days since June 20 through June 26,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation fell for the seventh straight month to 10.1
percent in June from 12.2 percent in May, the  Kenya  National
Bureau of Statistics said in an e-mailed statement today.
Kenya’s central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate  to a
record 18 percent last year to curb price gains and support the
shilling, and has kept it there this year.  The bank also accepted 3 billion shillings of bids for 28-
day term-auction deposits at 17.49 percent, 250 million
shillings for 21-day TADs at 17.5 percent and 250 million
shillings for 14-day TADs at a weighted average rate of 17.25
percent, the official said.  Longer-tenure term auction deposits have been introduced
“as an additional instrument for liquidity management,” the
bank said June 5.  Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.5 percent to 1,572 per dollar,
cutting its appreciation in the second quarter to 1.2 percent.
 Uganda ’s shilling weakened second time this week, depreciating
0.2 percent to 2,475 per dollar, reducing its advance in the
three months to 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
