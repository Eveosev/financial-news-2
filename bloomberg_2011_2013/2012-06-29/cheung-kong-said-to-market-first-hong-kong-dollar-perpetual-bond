Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. (1) ,
controlled by Hong Kong’s richest man  Li Ka-shing , is marketing
the first Hong Kong-dollar perpetual bond for a non-financial
company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and a person
familiar with the matter.  The developer, which led the industry in Hong Kong with the
most homes sold last year, is planning to offer the note at
5.125 percent to 5.375 percent, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the matter is private. The coupon will
increase by 1 percentage point after five years, the person
said.  Cheung Kong last sold a bond in the currency in November
raising HK$300 million ($39 million) in 3.35 percent 10-year
notes through its subsidiary  Cheung Kong  Finance MTN Ltd.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Winnie Cheong, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Cheung
Kong, didn’t immediately answer calls today seeking comment on
the sale.  This will be the fifth perpetual bond issued by Cheung Kong
and its units including  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , a diversified
company with interests in ports, telecommunications and retail.
Hutchison, controlled by Li, has issued the equivalent of $6
billion of debt this year, including $1 billion of perpetual
notes in May with a 6 percent coupon and $2.5 billion of
securities in January split into 10- and five-year tenors.  A perpetual bond has no fixed maturity and no principal
repayment, and generally pays a higher yield.  To contact the reporter on this story:
