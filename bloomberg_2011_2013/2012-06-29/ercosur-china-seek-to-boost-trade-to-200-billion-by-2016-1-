South America ’s Mercosur trade bloc
and China agreed to take steps to boost exports and seek to
increase annual trade to $200 billion by 2016, according to a
statement posted on the Mercosur  website .  China, the second-biggest buyer of goods from Mercosur, and
leaders from the trade bloc that met today in Mendoza agreed to
adopt measures to diversify trade, according to the statement.  The accord comes after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited
Brazil, Argentina and Chile in a bid to bolster relations with
the South American countries. In Brazil, Wen and President Dilma Rousseff agreed to sign an agreement in the next few weeks to
swap as much as $30 billion in their two currencies.  Wen and Argentina’s President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  on June 25 signed trade and investment agreements,
including a 9.5 billion-peso ($2.1 billion) loan from China
Development Bank Corp. and  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398) 
Ltd., for work in the Belgrano Cargas rail line.  Leaders from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay today agreed to
suspend Paraguay’s membership from Mercosur after congress last
week ousted President Fernando Lugo. The suspension will last
until the country holds presidential elections, Fernandez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
