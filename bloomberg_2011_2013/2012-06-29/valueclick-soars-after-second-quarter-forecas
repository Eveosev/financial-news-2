ValueClick Inc. (VCLK) , an Internet-
advertising company, rose the most in more than three years
after saying second-quarter revenue was probably at the higher
end of its forecast range.  ValueClick advanced 16 percent to $16.39 at the close in
New York, the biggest one-day gain since October 2008. The
shares had declined 13 percent this year through yesterday,
while the Standard & Poor’s Midcap Information Technology  Index (S4INFT) 
rose 4.8 percent.  The  Westlake Village , California-based company sees revenue
at the top end of its prediction of $155 million to $160
million, according to a statement released yesterday after the
markets closed. The average analysts’ estimate was $157.2
million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The high end of the range implies revenue growth of 28
percent from a year earlier, the biggest  increase  for a second
quarter since 2006. Sales growth in the media segment, which
accounted for  40 percent  of last year’s revenue, is “at or
above” expectations, the company said.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, will also be at the high end of a
 forecast  of $46 million to $48 million.  ValueClick has purchased $99.6 million in stock since May
2, and increased its share buyback program by $100 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
