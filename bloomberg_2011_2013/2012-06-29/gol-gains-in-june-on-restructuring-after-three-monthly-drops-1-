Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
the second-biggest Brazilian airline, rebounded in June after
three months of declines as it cut jobs and changed management
as part of a restructuring plan.  Shares fell 0.8 percent to 8.92 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, paring a monthly gain to 11 percent. The
benchmark Bovespa index rose 3.2 percent today and is down 0.2
percent this month.  Gol’s founder Constantino de Oliveira Jr. stepped down as
chief executive officer on June 18. Paulo Kakinoff,  Audi AG (NSU) ’s
Brazil head, will take over as CEO on July 2, the low-cost
carrier said in a statement on its website on June 19. Oliveira
will become chairman.  “This change is a mark in the restructuring plan the
airline has adopted this year to return to profitability,”
 Pedro Galdi , an analyst at brokerage SLW, said by phone from Sao
Paulo. “It might still take some quarters, but investors think
the strategy will work.”  Gol plans to cut about 2,500 employees to restore
profitability this year, Chief Financial Officer Leonardo Pereira said in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in  New
York  on June 25.  The airline posted a 41.4 million reais ($20.6 million)
loss in the first quarter, compared with net income of 69.4
million reais a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based airline said
May 3 in a regulatory filing. The average estimate among six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of 9.03 million
reais.  Gol fell 28 percent this year, while the Bovespa slid 4.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
