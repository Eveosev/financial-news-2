Julius Baer  Group Ltd. sent the
names of 2,500 employees, former employees and external managers
to U.S. authorities,  Le Temps  reported, citing a letter written
by Geneva-based lawyer Douglas Hornung to Swiss Finance Minister
Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf.  Julius Baer declined to comment on the matter, the Swiss
newspaper said. Martin Somogyi, a spokesman for the Zurich-based
bank, declined to comment when called by Bloomberg News.  Mario Tuor, a spokesman for the State Secretariat for
International Financial Matters in the Swiss capital Bern, said
the government hasn’t confirmed any figures with regard to the
transfer of employee names.  Julius Baer said Feb. 6 it expects to pay a fine and hand
over client data to U.S. authorities as part of an investigation
into Americans using Swiss banks to hide money from the  Internal
Revenue Service . The bank, which exited its U.S. private-client
business between 2009 and 2011, said at the time that the amount
of the fine is not “reliably assessable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
