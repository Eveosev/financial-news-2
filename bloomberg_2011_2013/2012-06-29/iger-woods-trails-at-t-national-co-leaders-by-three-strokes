Tiger Woods shot a 3-under-par 68
during his second round at the AT&T National, finishing play
tied for eighth at the tournament that benefits his charitable
foundation.  Woods, who opened the U.S. PGA Tour event at Congressional
Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, with a 1-over-par 71
yesterday, had an eagle, two birdies and a bogey today for a 3-
under finish. He’s 2-under for the event, three strokes behind
Zimbabwe’s Brendon de Jonge and American Jimmy Walker, each who
finished second-round play at 5-under par.  The majority of golfers in the 119-man field have yet to
complete their second of four rounds.  Woods, currently fourth in the  Official World Golf Ranking 
behind  Luke Donald , Rory McIlroy and  Lee Westwood , won the AT&T
National in 2009. A victory would give Woods 74 U.S. PGA Tour
titles, the second most in history behind  Sam Snead ’s 82.  Bo  Van Pelt , who shot a 4-under-par 67 yesterday to take a
one-shot lead into the second round, had 2-over 73 today with
four birdies and six bogeys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
