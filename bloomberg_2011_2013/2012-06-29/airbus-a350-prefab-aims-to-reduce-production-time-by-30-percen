(Correct number of jets to be produced monthly by 2018 in
last paragraph.)  Airbus SAS said it aims to cut the
time needed to assemble an A350 aircraft by 30 percent compared
with the A330 wide-body jet by prefabricating more parts in the
run-up to its first airworthy model in coming months.  Workers have begun fitting out the cabin at different
points in  Europe  before major chunks of the aircraft are pieced
together at the Toulouse headquarters in southern  France . Airbus
is also working on two levels at each station, with the ground
dedicated to structures, while workers on an upper floor equip
the interior with galleys, seats and systems.  Airbus wants to prevent the logjams the manufacturer
endured in the middle of the last decade when putting together
the double-decker A380 model. That plane entered service almost
three years late, with developing costs ballooning to more than
18 billion euros ($22 billion) from a planned 12 billion amid
challenges with cabin wiring work on the assembly floor.  “If we want to streamline things, then we need to be able
to pull back to an earlier stage more of the activities, and we
need to be able to do things in parallel,” said Gerard
Castaing, who oversees the assembly process for the A350, set
for entry into service in mid 2014. Castaing also designed the
A380 assembly process.  The A350 has 548 firm orders from 34 customers, the
majority for the A350-900. The smaller A350-800 version and the
larger A350-1000 variant aren’t scheduled for service until
2017. Airbus initially said the program would cost about 11
billion euros to develop and so far has not revised that figure.  Construction Under Way  Construction of the A350 final assembly line involved
investment costs of 140 million euros. The dedicated area
includes aircraft halls, offices, workshops and logistics areas,
as well as taxiways and roads.  Construction is under way on an additional building after
plans to take over A330 assembly areas for the A350 were foiled
by the lasting success of the older model. Airbus had planned to
wind down A330 production, though  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s three-year delay
on the 787 Dreamliner led to an increase in orders.  Airbus expects to ramp up to building 10 A350s a month by
2018, Castaing said. The plant has about 300 workers, a figure
that will double by year end and rise to 1,000 by the end of
2013. Assembling a single A350 will take four weeks. The
structure of the A350 is about 50 percent composite materials,
compared with 25 percent on the A380.  To contact the reporter on this story:
