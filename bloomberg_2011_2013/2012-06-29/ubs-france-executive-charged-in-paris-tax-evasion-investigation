An unnamed executive in  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s
French unit was charged yesterday in an investigation into tax-
evasion allegations.  The executive is under investigation for aiding in illicit
marketing, laundering and benefiting from the practices, Agnes
Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutors
office, said today.  The charges are the first levied in the probe, which was
opened in April after a preliminary inquiry by the French
customs service into a February 2011 complaint by the Prudential
Control Authority,  France ’s banking regulator. Investigators are
looking into the bank’s internal controls and transfers between
French accounts and undeclared ones in  Switzerland , according to
an April report in  Les Echos .  UBS France “will fully cooperate with the French
authorities,” the Zurich-based bank’s local unit said today in
a statement.  UBS avoided prosecution in the U.S. in 2009 by paying $780
million, admitting it helped thousands of Americans evade taxes
and turning over the names of 250 American clients to U.S.
authorities. UBS later revealed another 4,450 accounts held by
clients in the country.  The charge was reported earlier today by Agence France-
Presse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
