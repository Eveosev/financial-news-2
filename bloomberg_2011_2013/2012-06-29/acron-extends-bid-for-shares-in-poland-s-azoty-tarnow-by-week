OAO Acron extended its offer to buy
shares in Azoty Tarnow,  Poland ’s largest chemicals maker, by one
week to July 13.  The Russian fertilizer maker is seeking to buy as much as
66 percent of the voting shares in the Polish company for 36
zloty apiece, Acron said today in an e-mailed statement.  Acron is “continuing active talks with shareholders of the
company and has full interest in the project,” Vladimir Kantor,
a vice president, said in the statement.  The company “is ready” to discuss “any issues with
investors, including the bid price,” Parkiet reported today,
citing Russian billionaire Viatcheslav Kantor, who controls the
Acron.  To contact the reporters on this story:
