Taiwan’s government bonds had their
biggest quarterly gains since September as investors demanded
the safest assets amid concern a debt crisis in  Europe  is
hurting the island’s economy.  Taiwan held  interest rates  unchanged at 1.875 percent at a
quarterly meeting last week, after the statistics bureau revised
its 2012 growth forecast to 3.03 percent from 3.38 percent. The
local dollar dropped 1.3 percent this quarter as global funds
sold $5.9 billion more Taiwanese stocks than they bought,
according to exchange data. Benchmark 10-year yields rose the
most in a week today after European leaders agreed to ease
repayment rules for emergency loans to Spanish banks and relax
conditions on help to  Italy .  “Pessimism over economic prospects keeps looming over the
market,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “As borrowing costs remain
unchanged, there won’t be much room for yields to go down
further.”  The  benchmark  10-year rate dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.229 percent this quarter, according
to Gretai Securities Market. It rose three basis points in June.  The currency fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.9 against its U.S.
counterpart this month, and rose 0.2 percent today, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It dropped to NT$30.070 on June 5, the weakest
level since Jan. 17. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined 32 basis
points to 3.9 percent today.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  surged nine basis
points during the three-month period to 0.508 percent, the most
since 2007, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Centre. It slipped one basis point today
and this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
