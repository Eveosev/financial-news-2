The ruble appreciated the most
against the dollar in eight months as investors bet  Europe ’s
debt crisis will be contained, lifting prices for oil, Russia’s
chief export earner.  The Russian currency strengthened 2.1 percent to 32.43 per
dollar by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest gain since
Oct. 27. The ruble has weakened 0.9 percent this year and 9.2
percent since March, the sharpest quarterly drop since
September.  Brent crude  rallied 4.5 percent to $95.44 per barrel after
euro-area leaders announced measures aimed at stemming the
region’s debt crisis. The leaders dropped the requirement that
governments get prefered creditor status on crisis loans to
Spain’s banks and opened the door to recapitalizing lenders
directly with bailout funds once Europe sets up a single banking
supervisor.  The news from Europe was “not a game-changer of course,
but it is certainly more than the market was expecting,”
Vladimir Kolychev, chief economist at  Societe Generale  SA’s OAO
 Rosbank (ROSB)  unit in Moscow, said by e-mail. It “should boost
sentiment towards risky assets, and the ruble as well,” he
wrote.  Societe Generale expects the ruble to lose 1.4 percent by
the end of 2012 to 32.90 per dollar, according to an e-mailed
research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
