A committee of banks and investors
that governs credit-default swaps was asked to rule how  Sara Lee
Corp. (SLE) ’s split into a U.S. meat business and global coffee and
tea company will affect contracts linked to the company’s debt.  The  International Swaps and Derivatives Association ’s
determinations committee will rule on whether the split of Sara
Lee is a so-called succession event, the New York-based trade
group said today on its  website .  Sara Lee, the  Downers Grove , Illinois-based maker of Ball
Park Franks and Jimmy Dean sausage, renamed its meat business
Hillshire Brands Co. and spun the unit from its coffee and tea
division, which was renamed D.E. Master Blenders 1753 NV.
Hillshire began trading yesterday, making the split official.  Under credit swaps succession rules, if a new entity takes
on more than 25 percent of an existing company’s debt
obligations, while the old company keeps at least 25 percent of
the obligations, then credit swaps on the old company are split
between the new and old entities, according to definitions
published by ISDA. If a new entity takes on 75 percent or more
of the old company’s obligations, then the derivatives become
linked solely to that entity.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to
meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
