United Co. Rusal is questioning the
need for OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , in which it holds a 25 percent
stake, to buy back as much as 2 percent of its stock as the
Russian mining company considers spending cuts.  “Spending $600 million on a share buyback is a
controversial decision at a time when Norilsk needs to curb
investments and production costs to adjust to the market
situation,” said Maxim Sokov, Rusal’s director for strategy,
who has represented the aluminum producer on Norilsk’s board.  A slowing of commodities shipments from Russian ports is a
“warning sign potentially resembling 2008,” Sokov told
reporters today in Moscow after Norilsk’s annual general
meeting. Metals sales and prices slumped in 2008 as the global
economy slowed.  Norilsk’s board yesterday ordered management to study the
possibility of buying back a stake as large as 2 percent in the
Russian metals producer and to prepare a plan to retire 10
percent of the company’s stock, leaving only about 7 percent as
quasi-treasury shares.  It would be “reasonable” to use Norilsk’s quasi-treasury
shares as an acquisition currency, Sokov said today.  Projects such as billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s
Metalloinvest’s Udokan copper deposit would be a good
acquisition target for Norilsk, Sokov said.  A Metalloinvest official declined to comment on the
suggestion or to be identified.  Norilsk shares advanced 0.5 percent to 5,383 rubles by the
close of trading in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
