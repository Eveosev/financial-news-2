Investec Plc (INVP) , the owner of a bank
and money manager in South Africa and the U.K., cut Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Koseff’s compensation 87 percent after
profit dropped and returns hit a record low.  Koseff’s, who asked not to receive a bonus for fiscal 2012,
was paid 450,000 pounds ($703,305) including a basic salary of
344,791 pounds and benefits of 105,209 pounds, according to the
Johannesburg- and London-based lender’s  annual report , released
today. For fiscal 2011, Koseff got 3.4 million pounds, excluding
share awards.  “We acknowledge and value the leadership shown by three of
our executive directors in asking us not to consider performance
bonuses for them in respect of the 2012 financial year,” the
compensation committee chairman, George Alford, wrote in the
annual report, adding Investec discussed compensation with
shareholders and  South Africa ’s central bank. “The committee
has decided to rather focus compensation for these individuals
on the longer term” and hasn’t adjusted the fixed salary of
Koseff or Managing Director Bernard Kantor. Glynn Burger, the
finance director, also didn’t take a bonus.  Koseff was South Africa’s highest-paid banker in 2011, even
as Investec was the country’s fifth-largest lender with the
lowest returns. In a report in February, Johannesburg-based
research firm Prophet Analytics called Koseff South Africa’s
most overpaid CEO. Koseff was  overpaid  by 30.7 million rand
($3.72 million) in 2011, Loane Sharp, a labor economist,
calculated.  Investec has gained 8.5 percent this year compared with a
14 percent increase in the six-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Banks
Index. (JBNKS)  In  London , where Investec also trades, the shares are up
8.9 percent compared with a 9.2 percent rise in the FTSE 350
Banks Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
