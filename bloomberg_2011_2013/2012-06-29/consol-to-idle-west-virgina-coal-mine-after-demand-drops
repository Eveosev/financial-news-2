Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , the second-
biggest U.S. coal producer, will idle its Fola mining complex in
 West Virginia  after domestic demand for the fuel declined and
stockpiles increased.  The company will start laying off about 318 workers
starting Aug. 30, Pittsburgh-based Consol said in a statement
today. The move will reduce its 2012 production by 800,000 tons.
Consol said the “direct economic impact” of Fola is $165
million a year.  Consol is the latest U.S. coal producer to announce a
cutback in output as cheaper natural gas, a warm winter and
moves by the Environmental Protection Agency to curb emissions
from coal-burning  power plants  have reduced demand for the fuel.
Domestic coal use has dropped to the lowest since at least 1973,
according to a June 5 Energy Information Administration  report .  “The warm winter resulted in the growth of our utility
customers’ stockpiles and their inability to accept committed
coal shipments,” Consol President Nicholas J. DeIuliis said in
the statement. “The escalating costs and uncertainty generated
by recently advanced EPA regulations and interpretations have
created a challenging business climate for the entire coal
industry.”  Peabody Energy Corp. is the largest U.S. coal producer by
revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
