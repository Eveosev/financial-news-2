Brazil will maintain its reduction
of the IPI tax on certain consumer goods, Finance Minister  Guido
Mantega  said.  The tax cut on furniture to zero from 5 percent will be
extended for three months instead of expiring tomorrow, Mantega
said to reporters in Sao Paulo. The tax on refrigerators will be
lowered from 15 percent to 5 percent, on stoves from 4 percent
to zero, and on larger washing machines from 20 percent to 10
percent, all for two more months, Mantega said.  The tax cuts on appliances, which first went into effect
Dec. 1, have been successful in boosting sales, Mantega said.
The sectors benefiting from the tax breaks have committed to
maintaining employment, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
