The cost of insuring European
sovereign and financial debt fell after leaders of the 17 euro
nations agreed to ease repayment rules for emergency loans to
Spanish banks and to relax conditions on help for  Italy .  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments decreased nine basis points to
288 at 11 a.m. in  London , the lowest since May 11. The measure
is heading for a fourth weekly drop and the biggest monthly fall
since March. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of
 credit quality .  The deal alleviates concern of  bank failures  and a collapse
of the currency union that have fueled a surge in borrowing
costs for Spain and Italy. Euro-area chiefs, who have struggled
to agree on a strategy to contain the crisis that began in
 Greece  in 2009, said in a statement they’re determined to
“break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.”  “This is an important development as it potentially breaks
the sovereign/banking death spiral that has dogged the crisis,”
said Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at Credit Agricole SA in
London. “For today, and possibly a bit longer, this sets us up
for an outperformance of financials and peripheral credits, but
we would still urge caution.”  Default swaps on Banco Santander SA dropped 40.5 basis
points from a record closing price to 434, while Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA fell 41 from an all-time high to 458.5.  Spain, Ireland Tumble  Default swaps on  Spain  tumbled as much as 46 basis points
today to a one-month low of 543. The contracts, currently at
561, are set to match the biggest monthly decline since October.
Contracts on Ireland decreased 29 basis points to 582 and are
headed for a record monthly drop. Italy fell 26 basis points to
513.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell 19 basis points to 270 and the
subordinated index declined 28 to 443. Both measures are heading
for a fourth weekly decline, and the biggest monthly drop since
January.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 29 basis
points to 671. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings decreased eight basis points to
170 basis points. Both are set for the biggest monthly declines
since January.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
