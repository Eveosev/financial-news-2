Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  NBC Universal  named
Savannah Guthrie as Matt Lauer’s new co-anchor of the “Today”
show, a day after Ann Curry’s departure.  The appointment is effective immediately, according to the
announcement today from NBC News President Steve Capus.  Guthrie, 40, joined “Today” in June 2011 as chief legal
correspondent and co-host of the show’s third hour. She replaces
Curry, who announced she was leaving the show yesterday after
NBC’s ratings lead over competitors including ABC’s “Good
Morning America” has dwindled this year.  “As soon as Savannah joined NBC News she was a standout,
reporting for every franchise in the news division and rising
through the ranks,” said Jim Bell, executive producer of
“Today,” in the statement.  Before joining NBC, Guthrie served as Court TV’s legal
affairs and national trial correspondent. Guthrie previously
practiced law at Washington-based Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld
LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
