Tronox Ltd. (TROX) , the U.S pigment maker
that emerged from bankruptcy last year, slowed production after
ore costs rose and prices declined in  Europe  and the Asia-
Pacific region. The company also announced a share buyback.  The biggest factor in the “softness” in pigment demand is
concern about the economic slowdown in Europe and China,
 Stamford , Connecticut-based Tronox said today in a statement.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
in the second quarter will be about 20 percent less than first-
quarter Ebitda of about $151 million, Tronox said.  Tronox will repurchase as many as 2.5 million shares. The
buyback will begin as soon as is “practical,” Tronox Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Tom Casey said in the statement. The
company will also pay a $1.25-a-share dividend to shareholders
of record at the close of trading on July 13. Tronox will carry
out a 5-to-1 stock split on July 20.  “While we have considered issuing a special dividend as a
way to return capital to shareholders, we believe our stock is
undervalued at the present trading levels,” Casey said.  Tronox dropped 2 percent to $122 at 9:47 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
