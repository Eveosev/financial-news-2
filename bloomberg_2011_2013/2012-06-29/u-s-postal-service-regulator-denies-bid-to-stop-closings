The U.S.  Postal Service  may begin
closing mail-processing plants as soon as next week after its
regulator denied a labor-union request to block the closings.  The Postal Regulatory Commission today denied the American
Postal Workers Union’s request to halt the service’s plan to
close about 140 plants in the next year and about 90 in 2014.  The Postal Service, which has said it will save $2.1
billion annual and cut 5 percent of its workforce with the
closings, is “pleased” with the ruling, said David Partenheimer, a spokesman.  “The rapid decline in single-piece first-class mail makes
it urgent that we take these steps now,” he said in an e-mail.
“We also need Congress to do its part and enact comprehensive
postal legislation in the near future.”  The Postal Service reported a $3.2 billion loss in the
quarter ended March 31 and predicts it will temporarily run out
of cash in October.  The union, whose workers operate mail-processing machines,
criticized the decision.  “The decision demonstrates the need to strengthen the
commission’s authority and to enhance public input into USPS
plans that would affect service on a nationwide basis,” Cliff Guffey, president of the Washington-based union, said in a
statement posted on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
