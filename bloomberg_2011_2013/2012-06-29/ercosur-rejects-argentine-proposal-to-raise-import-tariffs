South America ’s Mercosur trade bloc
rejected an Argentine proposal to raise imports tariffs on all
goods to protect local industries, Uruguay’s  presidential
website said .  Officials at a meeting yesterday in the Argentine province
of Mendoza agreed to allow countries to raise tariffs on 200
goods unilaterally, up from the 100 goods agreed in December,
Alvaro Ons, general director for Integration and Mercosur of the
Uruguayan Foreign Ministry, said on the website.  “What was agreed doesn’t mean a change in the foreign
common tariffs,” Ons said, according to the statement. “It
will be a decision by each country, depending on its own
interest.”  The decision was taken by Argentina, Uruguay and  Brazil  as
 Paraguay , which also belongs to the Mercosur bloc, was banned
from participating after Congress last week impeached Fernando Lugo as president and replaced him with Vice President Federico Franco.  Presidents from the bloc and from the 12-nation Unasur meet
today in Mendoza to discuss the situation in Paraguay. They may
suspend the country’s participation in the bloc until it
“restores its democratic conditions,” Uruguayan lawmakers
Carlos Varela and Ruben Martinez Huelmo yesterday told reporters
after participating in the foreign ministers meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
