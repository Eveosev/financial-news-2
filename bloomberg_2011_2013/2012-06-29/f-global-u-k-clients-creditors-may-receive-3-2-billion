MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) ’s U.K.
administrators may return as much as $3.2 billion for creditors
of the failed broker, KPMG LLP said in an e-mailed statement.  Claims outstanding on the available funds could total as
much as $3.9 billion, KPMG said. The administrator estimated
there would be a minimum of $2.8 billion available to settle the
claims against the defunct broker’s estate.  “In determining the claims, we are working to discount
those we believe to be duplicative or spurious,” KPMG partner
Richard Heis said in the statement. “There are still numerous
work streams to be worked through but this estimated guide shows
that there are circumstances where a full pay out is possible.”  MF Global Holdings, the U.K. unit’s parent company, filed
the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy on Oct. 31 after getting
margin calls and bank demands for money at its MF Global Inc.
brokerage. The funds at the London-based unit are also being
sought by the trustee overseeing the U.S. bankruptcy, which may
reduce any recovery by U.K. creditors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
