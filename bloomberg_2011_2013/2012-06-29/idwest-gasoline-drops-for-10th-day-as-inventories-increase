Midwest gasoline declined for a 10th
day as inventories of the fuel and refinery activity increased.  Gasoline in the region fell to the lowest level since May 4
after stocks rose 980,000 barrels to 48.7 million barrels last
week, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Crude oil inputs
to refineries gained 57,000 barrels a day to 3.48 million.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest, or Group 3, widened 2.75 cents to 13.75 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in  New
York  at 12:45 p.m. The fuel was at a premium of 26.5 cents June
14. Prompt delivery gained 5.08 cents to $2.555 a gallon.  Tesoro Corp.’s 60,000-barrel-a-day Mandan refinery in  North
Dakota  is running at planned rates, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman
for the company, said in an e-mail. “We remain on schedule with
previously announced completion targets for our expansion
project,” she said.  Tesoro was scheduled to finish an expansion to increase the
plant’s crude-processing capacity 10,000 barrels a day by “the
latter part of this month,” Greg Goff, the company’s chief
executive officer, said in a statement June 7.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Chicago  narrowed its
discount 1.5 cents to 5.5 cents a gallon versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
