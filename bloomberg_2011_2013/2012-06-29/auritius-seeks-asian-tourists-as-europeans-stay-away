Mauritius  is seeking to boost
tourists arrivals from India,  Russia  and China by almost 50
percent this year as travelers to the Indian Ocean island from
Europe decline.  “We are aiming for as much as 120,000 visitors from these
countries in 2012,” Tourism Minister Michael Sik Yuen said in
an interview yesterday in the capital, Port Louis.  Total arrivals, which advanced 0.6 percent through May, are
below forecasts from Statistics Mauritius for the period. While
tourists from Europe, the main market, dropped 4.9 percent in
the five months because of a debt crisis and recession in some
of the region’s economies, arrivals from India, Russia and China
rose  27 percent  to 41,151.  Europe  accounted for about two-third
of 964,642 tourists to Mauritius last year, while 81,213 came
from those three countries, according to the statistics agency.  Tourism is one of the country’s biggest foreign currency
earners. Revenue rose 15 percent to 17.6 billion rupees ($568
million) in the four months through April, according to the
central bank. Arrivals fell 0.2 percent during the same period.
The statistics agency has forecast 980,000 tourist arrivals for
2012.  “Successful implementation of marketing strategies and
resolving of landing rights issues would lead to Mauritius
reaching the one million visitors mark,” Sik Yuen said.  Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth-biggest
airline, is cutting unprofitable long-haul flights to Europe
this year. Asian airlines have expressed interest in increasing
weekly flights or starting routes to Mauritius, the minister
said. A Chinese airline has been given landing rights and the
opening of a new airport next year will help to boost arrivals,
he said.  Leisure stocks, led by  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , which
account for  10 percent  of the 38-member SEMDEX index, are the
 worst-performing  on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius this year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
