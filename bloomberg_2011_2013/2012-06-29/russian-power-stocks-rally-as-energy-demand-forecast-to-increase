OAO MRSK Holding (MRSK) , Federal Grid Co.
and OAO RusHydro were among power stocks that rose after
 Russia ’s Federal Tariff Service forecast energy demand growth
through 2013.  MRSK, the country’s largest electricity distribution
company, gained 5.1 percent to 1.779 rubles by the close in
Moscow. Federal Grid, Russia’s monopoly for high-voltage power
transmission lines, climbed 3.1 percent to 19.57 kopeks.
RusHydro, Russia’s largest hydropower company, added 3.7 percent
to 78.91 kopeks. OAO Inter RAO UES, the Russian state-controlled
power generator and exporter, rose 3.3 percent to 2.80 kopeks.  The Federal Tariff Service forecast total energy demand
growth at 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent in 2013, which
beat the estimates of analysts at  Alfa Bank .  The news is “positive for generating companies across the
board and for the overall power sector, as demand is the
fundamental factor that drives these stocks,” analysts led by
Alexander Kornilov said in an e-mailed note.  MRSK, Federal Grid and RusHydro are among the  worst
performers  on the Micex this quarter, having lost more than 26
percent.  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
