Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  may get a
ruling by July 1 on its request to delay a ban on U.S. sales of
its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer won by  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , a judge
said.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, who announced the timetable
at a hearing today in San Jose,  California , issued an order June
26 blocking U.S. sales of the tablet as part of patent- and
trademark-infringement litigation between Samsung and Apple over
smartphones and tablets.  The world’s two biggest makers of high-end phones have
accused each other of copying designs and technology for mobile
devices and are fighting patent battles on four continents to
retain their dominance in the $219 billion global smartphone
market.  Samsung argued in a court filing that Koh’s order is
“improper” and should be lifted while the company appeals the
ruling. The court relied on old evidence and has refused to
consider newer evidence demonstrating that a patent at issue in
the case is invalid, according to the filing.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.,
11- cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose).  To contact the reporters on this story:
