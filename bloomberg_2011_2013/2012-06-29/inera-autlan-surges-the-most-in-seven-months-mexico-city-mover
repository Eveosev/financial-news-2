Cia. Minera Autlan SAB (AUTLANB) ,  North
America â€™s largest manganese producer, rose the most in seven
months in Mexico City after saying second-quarter sales and
profit rose.  The San Pedro Garza Garcia-based miner gained 8.3 percent
to 14.47 pesos for its biggest advance since November.  Revenue rose more than 20 percent in the second quarter and
Ebitda, a measure of earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, jumped more than 40 percent, the
company said today in a preliminary earnings statement to the
Mexican stock exchange. The miner said that a rebound in prices
for manganese, a mineral used to produce steel, and a weaker
peso boosted quarterly earnings.  The company only provided percentage changes for revenue
and Ebitda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
