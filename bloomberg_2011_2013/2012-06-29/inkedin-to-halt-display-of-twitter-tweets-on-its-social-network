LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , owner of the world’s
biggest professional-networking website, said posts from Twitter
Inc. will no longer be displayed on its site, as the
microblogger encourages users to visit its own services.  LinkedIn users had been able to show the posts, known as
tweets, on their accounts since 2009, the  Mountain View ,
California-based company said on its  blog . LinkedIn said members
can still send updates to Twitter from their LinkedIn accounts
by checking a box for tweets when they compose updates.  Twitter has been increasing its focus on getting more users
to look at tweets through its own website and on mobile
applications, as it seeks to boost advertising revenue. The
company expects to generate at least $1 billion in advertising
revenue in 2014, two people familiar with the forecast said this
month.  “They don’t want people to consume and interact with
Twitter in places where they probably have no ability to put
ads,” said  Greg Sterling , an analyst at Opus Research.  Twitter, in an earlier blog post today,  said  the company is
focused on helping users.  “We’re building tools for publishers and investing more
and more in our own apps to ensure that you have a great
experience everywhere you experience Twitter, no matter what
device you’re using,” the company said on its blog.  The changes come as San Francisco-based Twitter is
expanding the content users can post on its service, known for
its 140-character tweets.  LinkedIn, citing Twitter’s blog, said the switch was
motivated by Twitter’s  efforts  to create a “consistent set of
products and tools” for its microblogging service.  “We know many of you value Twitter as an additional way to
broadcast professional content beyond your LinkedIn
connections,” LinkedIn said on the blog. “Moving forward, you
will still be able to share your updates with your Twitter
audience by posting them on LinkedIn.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
