Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said the government is willing to accept the
possibility of slower economic growth in exchange for cooling
off the country’s housing market.  Flaherty, speaking on a conference call with reporters
today, said he realizes the tougher mortgage rules he announced
last week may have a “dampening effect” on the economy and the
residential real eatate market.  “We’re prepared to take that risk, quite frankly, because
of the greater risk of the development over time of a housing
bubble,” he said, adding he’s “very concerned with the condo
market in  Canada ’s largest cities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
