Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , the U.S. biotechnology
company backed by the French oil company  Total SA (FP)  and the
specialty chemicals maker Lanxess AG, will sell stock and notes
to raise $102 million.  Gevo priced a secondary offering of 12.5 million shares at
$4.95 a share, expecting to raise almost $62 million before
commissions and fees are deducted, according to a statement
today. The company also priced $40 million worth of 7.5 percent
convertible notes due in 2022.  The company, based in Englewood, Colorado, will use the
proceeds to partially fund the retrofit of a Redfield Energy LLC
biofuel plant in South Dakota, repay debt and pay for its plant
in Luverne, Minnesota, which began production in May. Gevo
announced plans to raise more capital June 27.  Gevo makes isobutanol from corn and non-food crops.
Isobutanol may be blended with gasoline or refined into jet
fuel, specialty chemicals or other products that are typically
derived from petroleum.  The companyâ€™s shares rose 0.4 percent to $4.97 at the close
in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
