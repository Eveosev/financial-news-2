Russia’s Financial Markets Service
will give Euroclear Bank SA and Clearstream International SA
direct access to Russian sovereign debt markets through the
country’s central depositary, according to a  statement  on the
regulator’s website late yesterday.  Euroclear and Clearstream will be able to handle only
Russian state and municipal debt and debt from foreign entities
until July 1, 2014, according to a proposal posted on the
website. The system may include Russian corporate debt and
shares after a monitoring period, RIA Novosti said, citing
Dmitry Pankin, head of the regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
