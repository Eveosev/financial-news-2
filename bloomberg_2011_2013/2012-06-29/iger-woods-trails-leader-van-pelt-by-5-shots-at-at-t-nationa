Bo Van Pelt holds a one-shot lead
over a trio of golfers going into today’s second round at the
AT&T National, where Tiger Woods trails by five strokes.  Van Pelt, an American who got his sole victory on the U.S.
PGA Tour three years ago, began the tournament yesterday with a
4-under-par 67 at the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda,
Maryland.  Vijay Singh  of Fiji, Zimbabwean Brendon de Jonge and
Jimmy Walker of the U.S. are tied at 3 under.  Woods, the 2009 champion, is tied with 17 players for 30th
place at 1 over following a round that included three bogeys and
two birdies. A victory would give Woods 74 titles, the second
most in history after  Sam Snead ’s 82.  Australian  Adam Scott  slept later than he expected
yesterday and only made his 8:02 a.m. tee time because of a
five-minute backup for players at the 10th tee, his first of the
day. Scott finished at 4 over.  To contact the reporter on this story:
