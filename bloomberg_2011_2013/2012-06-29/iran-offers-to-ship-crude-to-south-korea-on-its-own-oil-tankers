Iran  offered to supply oil to  South
Korea  on its own tankers as the European Union moves to stop
shippers from getting insurance for cargoes from the Persian
Gulf nation, according to a government official in Seoul.  The South Korean government is still discussing how it will
deal with EU sanctions on Iran that take effect July 1, said the
official who asked not to be identified because the matter is
confidential. An official at the National Iranian Oil Co.’s
office in  Singapore  declined to comment or be named.  South Korea, which imports all of its crude, may halt
purchases from Iran after it failed to win an exemption from the
EU ban, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement
June 26.  The sanctions mean 95 percent of the world’s tankers may
lose insurance if they carry cargo from the Persian Gulf state
because they’re covered by the 13 members of the London-based
 International Group  of P&I Clubs.  Japan ’s parliament passed a
bill last week to provide $7.6 billion of sovereign guarantees
to its tanker owners that ship Iranian oil as it seeks to
maintain imports from the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
