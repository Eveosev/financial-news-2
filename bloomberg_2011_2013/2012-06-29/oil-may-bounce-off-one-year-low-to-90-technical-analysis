Oil may rebound to as high as $90 a
barrel if prices hold above a support level near $75, according
to  technical analysis  from Iitrader.com.  Oil futures have tumbled 25 percent this quarter on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , heading for the biggest three-month
drop since 2008. The decline may halt near the one-year intraday
low of $74.95 and prices may rise 20 percent from that level to
approach $90, said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and
founder of Iitrader.com in Chicago.  “We haven’t breached the one-year low, and that bodes well
with the thesis that you are going to see buyers against that
level,” Ilczyszyn said. “The market is way oversold. I would
expect there is a bounce over the one-year low.”  Crude for August delivery declined $2.52, or 3.1 percent,
to $77.69 a barrel yesterday on the Nymex, the lowest settlement
since Oct. 4, the same day the contract touched the intraday
low. Prices are down 29 percent from this year’s settlement high
of $109.77 on Feb. 24.  A breach of support at the one-year low could send  oil
prices  down another $5 to $10, Ilczyszyn said.  Technical analysts use historical chart patterns and tools
such as moving averages to predict price movements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
