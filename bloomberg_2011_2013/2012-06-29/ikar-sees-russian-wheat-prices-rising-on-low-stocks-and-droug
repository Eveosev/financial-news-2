Prices for Russian fourth-grade
milling wheat rose as much as 7.6 percent to 7,100 rubles ($218)
a metric ton in Stavropol and Krasnodar in the week to
yesterday, on falling stocks and drought, according to the
Institute for Agricultural Market Studies.  The country’s grain stocks fell to 16.8 million tons on
June 1 from 22 million tons on May 1, according to the State
Statistics Service data. The  Agriculture Ministry  cut its 2012
harvest forecast this week to 85 million tons from an earlier
estimate of 94 million tons because of winter frosts and spring
drought.  Parts of Rostov and Krasnodar in the Southern federal
district and in Stavropol in North Caucasus were in drought,
prompting lower expectations for the new crop, increasing demand
among local traders and millers and pushing prices up, Oleg
Sukhanov, head of market analysis at the institute, known as
Ikar, said yesterday.  Certain big lots, comprised of several dozen tons of grain,
were offered at as much as 7,300 rubles a ton at farms in North
Caucasus, Sukhanov said in a telephone interview in Moscow.  Rising Russian prices may be enough to keep wheat in the
country and to curb exports, according to Ikar. Exporters slowed
down their business and are waiting for a wider margin between
international and domestic prices, Sukhanov said.  Wheat for September delivery rose 0.4 percent to $7.49 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 6:09 p.m. Moscow time.
That converts to $275.21 a ton. Russia’s wheat price is $270 to
$275 a ton at free-on-board basis in the Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk at present, Sukhanov said.  Russia’s  wheat exports  are seen at 13.5 million to 13.8
million tons for the season 2012-13, compared with an estimated
21 million tons in 2011-12, according to Ikar data.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
