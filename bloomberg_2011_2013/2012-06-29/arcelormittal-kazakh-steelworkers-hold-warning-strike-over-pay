Steelworkers at  ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s
Kazakh unit held a warning strike today, seeking a 30 percent
increase in wages on top of an inflation adjustment.  The ArcelorMittal Temirtau unit has proposed a total 10
percent wage increase for steelworkers, the same amount it
recently agreed with coal miners, Roman Ilto, a Temirtau-based
spokesman for the company, said today by phone. The unit said
June 20 its pay raise for coal workers included 7.4 percent to
compensate for inflation, after rejecting higher demands.  Output wasn’t hurt by the strike, which lasted for about
two hours in the morning, Ilto said.  Unions representing ArcelorMittal Temirtau’s 35,300 staff
declined an offer in February to adjust wages for inflation and
discuss other increases after a sales target for rolled steel
was reached, the Kazakh unit of the world’s biggest steelmaker
said on Feb. 28. Demands for salary increases by oil workers in
western  Kazakhstan  triggered strikes and deadly violence last
year as police used arms to suppress unrest in Zhanaozen during
Independence Day celebrations on Dec. 16.  The company is ready to discuss further wage increases when
demand for its products stabilizes, Ilto said. “ Iran  was a
significant market for the company’s rolled-steel sales, and now
it’s closed,” he said, adding that this led to a cut in the
first-quarter output.  The company decreased rolled-steel production by 8.8
percent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
