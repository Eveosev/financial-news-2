Copper rose the most in almost seven
months in  New York  amid reduced concern that the euro-region
debt crisis will crimp demand after officials agreed to ease
rules for emergency loans to Spanish banks.  Leaders of the 17 euro nations meeting in Brussels dropped
a requirement that taxpayers get preferred creditor status on
crisis loans to  Spain ’s blighted banks. The euro gained the most
since October against the dollar, making metals priced in
greenbacks cheaper for users of the single currency.  “It’s a reaction to the news about the European Union
situation,”  Nikos Kavalis , an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in  London , said by phone today. “For this to become a
trend, you need a series of news to come out to suggest they are
really taking the necessary steps.”  Copper for September delivery climbed 4 percent to $3.465 a
pound by 8:59 a.m. on the Comex in New York after gaining as
much as 4.5 percent, the most since Nov. 30. Prices are up 3
percent in June and down 9.4 percent for the current quarter.
The London Metal Exchange’s three-month contract rose 3.7
percent to $7,659 a metric ton.  A weaker dollar also makes commodities more appealing as an
alternative investment.  Copper inventories monitored by the LME rose for a seventh
session to 257,150 tons, daily exchange figures showed. That
capped an 11 percent increase for June, the first  monthly 
expansion since September. Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange rose to 139,442 tons this week, according to
figures posted on the bourse’s website.  Orders to draw copper from LME warehouses declined 1.8
percent to 27,800 tons. Still, they climbed 29 percent this
month after plunging 77 percent in May.  Aluminum for three-month delivery on the LME rose 1.9
percent to $1,880 a ton.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. producer
of the lightweight metal, will cut the workforce at its Point
Henry smelter in  Australia  by 10 percent to lower costs,
committing to keep it operating for at least two years. The
smelter produced about 190,000 tons of aluminum a year.  Zinc, lead, nickel and tin gained in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
