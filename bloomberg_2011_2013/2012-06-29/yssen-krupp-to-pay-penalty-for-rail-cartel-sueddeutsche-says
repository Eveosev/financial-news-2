Thyssen-Krupp Stahl and other steel
companies will be fined for having set up a cartel that Deutsche
Bahn estimates may have cost it as much as 500 million euros
($632 million) on rail equipment,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  Germany â€™s Federal Cartel Office intends to notify Thyssen-
Krupp of the penalty in July, the newspaper said, without
specifying how it obtained the information. Thyssen-Krupp
confirmed that a settlement is underway without providing
details, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
