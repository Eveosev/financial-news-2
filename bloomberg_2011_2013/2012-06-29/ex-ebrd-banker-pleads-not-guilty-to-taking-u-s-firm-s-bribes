Former European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development banker Andrey Ryjenko pleaded not
guilty to accepting bribes and laundering more than $3 million.  His co-defendant, former  Standard Bank  Plc employee Tatjana Sanderson, also pleaded not guilty to the same charges at a
hearing today in London. The two are accused of taking bribes to
show favor to a company called Chestnut Consulting Inc. between
September 2007 and March 2010, according to the indictment.  The two were also charged with transferring the funds from
Chestnut Consulting’s managing director Dmitrij Harder to
Sanderson’s bank accounts. Chestnut Consulting is based in
Southampton,  Pennsylvania , and arranges financing for the
energy, metals and mining, infrastructure, and industrial
production firms, according to its  website .  Sanderson, whose last name was formerly Ryjenko, previously
worked at Standard Bank, according to the U.K. Financial
Services Authority’s register of approved people. The case is
scheduled for trial in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
