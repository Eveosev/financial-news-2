German savings banks said they were
pleased that the most recent European Union summit to stem the
sovereign debt crisis didn’t result in a pan-European deposit
insurance plan.  “This is a big achievement by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ,”
Georg Fahrenschon of the DSGV banking group said in a statement
today. “It will avoid a situation in which German savers could
be liable for ailing foreign banks.”  The protection of deposits should be harmonized on the
European level with “real” financial means in each country,
while keeping national responsibilities in place, Fahrenschon
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
