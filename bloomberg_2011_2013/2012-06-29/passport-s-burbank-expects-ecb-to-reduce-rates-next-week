John Burbank , founder of $3.4
billion Passport Capital LLC, expects the  European Central Bank 
to cut interest rates when it meets on July 5.  “The last thing the EU needs is a stronger euro,” said
Burbank, speaking today on Bloomberg Television’s “Lunch
Money” of his reason for the prediction.  “I like the dollar
in a deflationary world.”  The euro surged about 2 percent against the  U.S. dollar ,
the most this year, after European Union leaders eased terms on
loans to Spanish banks. It traded at $1.2662 at 1:30 p.m. in New
York after opening at $1.2443.  The central bank probably will lower the benchmark rate to
0.75 percent from 1 percent next week, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Burbank, 48, said the earnings of U.S. companies will be
“pretty bad” in the second quarter with shortfalls
“habitual,” which the U.S. stock market isn’t discounting. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped about 2 percent today.  “We’ve been predicting a  bear market  for the last six
months,” said the hedge-fund manager, speaking from his offices
in San Francisco. Burbank’s main fund rose 20 percent in 2012
through May, investors said earlier this month.  Burbank said the best U.S. stocks to own will be large-
capitalization companies that pay high dividends. He’s betting
on declines for companies, such as commodities producers, that
depend on global growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
