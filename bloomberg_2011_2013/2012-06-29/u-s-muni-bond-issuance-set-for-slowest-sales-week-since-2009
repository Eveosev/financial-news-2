The $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal
market is poised for the skimpiest issuance since 2009 as local-
 government bonds  remain cheaper than Treasuries for a seventh
straight week.  States and cities plan to sell about $62 million of debt in
the holiday-shortened July 4 week, the least since the start of
2009 and down from $9 billion this week, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The  yield  on top-rated munis maturing in 10 years rose
about 0.02 percentage point this week to 1.92 percent, according
to a Bloomberg Valuation index. Muni  interest rates  haven’t been
below those on Treasuries since mid-May,  data  compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “There’s certainly anticipation of pretty light supply
next week,” said Ken Friedrich, manager of municipal sales,
trading and syndication at  RBC Capital Markets  in  New York .
“The market has taken on a more positive tone in the last few
days.”  Benchmark 10-year Treasury  yields  fell by about 0.03
percentage point this week to 1.64 percent as of about 3:30 p.m.
in New York. The securities pared weekly gains as euro-area
leaders relaxed terms on loans to Spanish banks as part of
measures to contain the region’s debt crisis.  Yields on 10-year munis rated AAA were about 117 percent of
their federal counterparts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The ratio, a measure of relative of value between the
two asset classes, has been above 100 percent since May 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
