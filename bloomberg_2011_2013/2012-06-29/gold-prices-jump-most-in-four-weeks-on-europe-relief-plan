Gold is set for the worst quarter in
eight years as concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will persist
boosted the dollar. Silver and platinum headed for their worst
quarters since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Spot gold rose as much as 0.3 percent to $1,556.55 an ounce
and was at $1,556.10 at 10:34 a.m. in Singapore. Bullion fell
6.7 percent since the end of March, the worst quarter since the
period to June 2004, as the dollar rallied 4.7 percent against a
six-currency basket. The metal is also set for its weakest half-
year showing since the six months to December 2008, after the
U.S. Federal Reserve didn’t buy more debt and instead extended a
program of replacing short-term bonds with longer-term debt.  European leaders meeting in Brussels struggled to find
consensus, with  Italy ,  Spain  and  France  withholding agreement on
a 120 billion-euro ($149 billion) growth pact, according to
French President  Francois Hollande . German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel , opposed to any effort to join forces on sovereign debt,
yesterday canceled a planned media briefing as talks continue.  “Gold has been and, at least in the near term, will
continue to be influenced by the global macroeconomic
environment, movements in the dollar and other asset classes,”
said Wang Xiaoli, chief investment strategist at CITICS Futures
Co., a unit of  China ’s biggest listed brokerage. “Investors are
waiting for what’s going to happen in Europe even though
everyone knows they can’t resolve the crisis overnight.”  August-delivery gold gained 0.3 percent to $1,555.10 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York . Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust,
the biggest exchange-traded product backed by bullion, stood at
1,281.6 metric tons yesterday, unchanged since June 18, the
company’s website showed.  Jobs Data  Cash gold has rallied for 11 years as central banks joined
investors in buying bullion to diversify assets and hedge
against accelerating consumer prices. The metal is 0.5 percent
lower this year as the euro slumped 3.9 percent against the
dollar. Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of commodities dropped the
most in a week yesterday as German unemployment climbed in June
and U.S. jobless claims held near the highest level of 2012.  Spot silver rose 0.3 percent to $26.4412 an ounce. The
metal slumped to $26.16 an ounce yesterday, the lowest price
since Dec. 29, and is 18 percent lower since the end of March,
poised for its worst quarterly loss since the three months to
September 2008.  The drop in silver, used mainly in industrial applications,
helped drive the so-called gold-silver ratio to 59.206 yesterday,
the highest level since Sept. 26, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. One ounce of gold last bought 58.8459 ounces of silver.  Cash platinum was little changed at $1,389.25 an ounce,
after falling to $1,384.25 earlier, the cheapest since Dec. 30.
The metal used mainly in autocatalysts has declined 15 percent
this quarter, the worst since the period to September 2008.
Palladium, poised for a second quarterly loss, climbed 0.3
percent to $567.25 an ounce, after tumbling to $560.88 yesterday,
the lowest level since Oct. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
