Gasoline surged the most since March
after European leaders eased repayment rules for Spanish banks,
alleviating concern that the region’s debt crisis will spread
and curb fuel demand.  Futures rose as much as 3.1 percent as leaders of the 17
euro countries dropped requirements that governments get
preferred creditor status on aid to  Spain ’s banks and opened the
way to recapitalize lenders directly with bailout funds. The
dollar fell the most against the euro since October, increasing
the investment appeal of commodities.  “It appears our old friend ‘Rosy Scenario’ has returned to
the energy markets,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market
research at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“Expectations for this summit were so low any news of a
positive nature would cause a bid to come back into the market.
All they did was lower temperatures. They haven’t solved the
problem.”  July-delivery gasoline rose 7.02 cents, or 2.7 percent, to
$2.6844 a gallon at 9:51 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after touching $2.695. Prices have fallen 5 percent
this month and are down 21 percent in the quarter. The contract
is for reformulated gasoline, or RBOB. The August contract
advanced 7.66 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.5539.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 9.44 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $2.6463 a gallon. Prices touched $2.6526, the
biggest one-day gain since July 7, 2011. Prices have lost 2.2
percent this month and are down 16 percent since March 30. The
more actively traded August contract gained 9.54 cents, or 3.8
percent, to $2.6426.  Contract Expiration  Heating oil and gasoline contracts for July delivery will
expire at the close of floor trading today.  “Today is last day of the quarter,” Armstrong said.
“Energy markets were extremely beat up this quarter and, if you
were short, you’ve been extremely successful. It’s time to book
those profits.”  Euro leaders at a summit in Brussels also relaxed the
conditions for possible aid to  Italy .  Futures’ gains were part of a broad recovery. Crude oil for
August delivery rose $3.92, or 5.1 percent, to $81.61 a barrel
on the Nymex. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped 1.5 percent
at 9:55 a.m. in  New York .  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.6
cents to $3.353 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest level since Jan. 5.
