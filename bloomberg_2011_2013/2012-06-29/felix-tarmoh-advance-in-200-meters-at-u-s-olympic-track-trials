Allyson Felix and Jeneba Tarmoh, who
tied for the third American Olympic spot in the women’s 100
meters, each won her heat last night in the 200 at the U.S.
track and field trials in Eugene,  Oregon .  Felix, a silver medalist in the 200 at the 2008 Beijing
Olympics, won her heat in 22.82 seconds and Tarmoh was first in
hers in 22.90. The night’s best time of 22.57 was turned in by
Tianna Madison.  Twenty-one women advanced to the 200 semifinals tonight.
The final is set for tomorrow, with the top three finishers
qualifying for the U.S. team for the London Olympics.  Felix and Tarmoh finished the 100 final on June 23 with
identical times of 11.068, and it has not yet been determined
whether a coin toss or a run-off will be used to pick the third
qualifier in that event.  There were finals in five events last night at the trials.  Brad Walker won the men’s pole vault with a clearance of 18
feet, 7 1/4 inches (5.67 meters). Joining him on the Olympic
team will be Jeremy Scott and Derek Miles.  Lance Brooks won the men’s discus with a final toss of 213
feet, 9 inches to lead Jarred Rome (207-10) and Jason Young
(203-11) to the London Games.  Evan Jager won the men’s 3,000-meter steeplechase in
8:17.40, and will be joined on the Olympic squad by Donald
Cabral (8:19.81) and Kyle Alcorn (8:22.17).  Galen Rupp set a meet record of 13:22.67 in the men’s 5,000
meters, with Bernard Lagat second in 13:22.82 and Lopez Lomong
third in 13:24.47. In the women’s 5,000, Julie Culley won in
15:13.77 and was followed into the Olympics by Molly Huddle
(15:14.40) and Kim Conley (15:19.79).  To contact the reporter on this story:
