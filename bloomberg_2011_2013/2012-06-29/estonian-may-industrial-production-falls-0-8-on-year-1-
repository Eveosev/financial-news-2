Estonia ’s industrial output shrank
in May from a year earlier at the slowest pace in three months,
as improving domestic demand partly offset the weakening
export demand.  Production declined 0.8 percent, compared with a revised
4.1 percent fall in April, the Tallinn-based statistics office
said today on its website. Output rose 1.1 percent from the
previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.  Retail sales increased 8 percent from a year earlier, the
fastest pace in three months, the statistics office said in a
separate statement.  The economy of the newest euro-area member, which grew 7.6
percent last year, the European Union’s fastest pace, faces
ebbing demand for its electronics and metals exports to Sweden
and Finland as  Europe ’s debt crisis deepens. Electronics output
fell 4.3 percent from a year earlier, after dropping 24 percent
in April.  Output last month increased from a year earlier in half of
the industries, more than in April, the statistics office said.
Gains were led by electrical equipment, rising 18 percent, while
wood processing rose 2 percent and  food production  1 percent.  Thirty percent of Estonia’s exports went to the euro region
last year, while 66 percent went to the EU. The share of the
 Commonwealth of Independent States  rose to 13 percent, according
to statistics office data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
