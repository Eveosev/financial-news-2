Federal  Reserve Bank  of Boston
President  Eric Rosengren  said so-called stress tests of banks,
used to see how they would fare in an economic slump, should
encompass money-market funds that are affiliated with them.  There has been a “pattern of support” for mutual funds by
the banks that sponsor them, “without an explicit recognition
that such funds can be a capital drain” on the banks during
times of stress, Rosengren said today in remarks prepared for a
speech in Amsterdam. He didn’t discuss the outlook for monetary
policy or the economy.  Rosengren said stress tests, which are used by the Fed to
gauge the health of the nation’s largest banks, would “make
clear that money-market mutual funds with well-capitalized
sponsors are likely to be less risky than those that do not have
well-capitalized sponsors,” he said.  Regulators have worked for nearly four years to toughen the
rules governing the $2.5 trillion industry, concerned that money
funds are vulnerable to runs and pose a threat to financial
market stability. Changes proposed by U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman  Mary Schapiro  that would force
funds to abandon their traditional $1 share price or adopt
capital cushions lack enough support among the four other
commissioners to win approval.  Regulators’ Focus  Once considered among the safest investments, money-market
funds have been a focus of regulators since the September 2008
collapse of the $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund, which
triggered a broader run on money funds, contributing to a freeze
in global credit markets. In its initial response to the Reserve
Primary collapse, the SEC adopted rules that imposed liquidity
minimums on money-market funds, tightened average maturity
limits, raised credit-quality standards and added new disclosure
requirements.  Rosengren’s district is home to  Fidelity Investments , the
nation’s largest provider of money-market mutual funds with $403
billion of assets at the end of May, according to research firm
Crane Data LLC. Fidelity isn’t affiliated with a bank.
Fidelity’s biggest rival is New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
which runs funds that have assets totaling $247 billion.  Ianthe Zabel, spokeswoman for the  Investment Company
Institute , which represents bank-owned and non-bank fund
providers, declined to comment.  Rosengren, 54, backed Schapiro’s proposals while saying
it’s unclear they’ll be adopted. She can count on only one
supporting vote on the commission, from Elisse B. Walter.  ‘Very Supportive’  “I am very supportive of the current push within the SEC
for additional reforms,” Rosengren said. In the absence of
those measures, he said, it would be helpful to focus on bank-
sponsored money funds, which hold just over half of all U.S.
money fund assets.  “Based on the historical experience of their money-market
funds, the historical experience of similar funds, and their
money-market funds’ exposures, sponsors could calculate the
likely capital support needed from the organization in a stress
scenario,” he said at the Conference on Post-Crisis Banking
hosted by the central bank of the Netherlands.  “This is an admittedly partial approach,” Rosengren said,
adding that it “would at least make more banking organizations
more resilient.”  Schapiro told the Senate Banking Committee on June 22 that
the agency has found at least 300 examples of money fund
sponsors stepping in to provide or line up capital support to
prevent the funds from breaking the buck.  Expanded Tests  Rosengren said stress tests can be expanded to help protect
the financial system from risks other than individual  bank
failures . In its annual stress tests,  the Fed  evaluates how
banks would fare in an adverse economic scenario and whether
they may need more capital.  “Increasing the focus of stress tests beyond safety and
soundness of individual institutions to more systemic concerns
and implications -- such as how markets and institutions behave
during periods of stress -- is an under-researched area that
deserves more attention,” Rosengren said.  Stress tests could also be used to assess vulnerabilities
from broker-dealers, he said.  “More work needs to be done on the implications of
potential crisis-related stresses at broker-dealers that do not
have access to liquidity facilities,” Rosengren said.  Rosengren was formerly the head of banking supervision and
regulation at the Boston Fed. He became president its president
in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
