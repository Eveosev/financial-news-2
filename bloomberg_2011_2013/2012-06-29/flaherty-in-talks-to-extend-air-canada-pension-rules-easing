Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he is in discussions with  Air Canada (AC/A)  and its
unions about the possibility of extending a moratorium on
reduced funding payments for its pension plans.  Flaherty said all parties, including the company’s retired
workers, need to be part of an agreement before any additional
changes are made. Flaherty agreed in 2009 on a 21-month
moratorium on payments covering past service.  “This is not easy because the pension obligations are
quite large so I anticipate it will be a difficult road but I
hope all the parties will be able to agree,” Flaherty said in a
conference call with reporters from Ireland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
