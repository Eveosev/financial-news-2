Argentina ’s Buenos Aires province
needs 1.8 billion pesos ($400 million) to pay provincial
government employees their mid-year bonuses, newspaper Cronista
Comercial reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  The 1 billion pesos that the federal government announced
yesterday it will transfer aren’t enough to cover the province’s
needs, as governor Daniel Scioli expected to receive 2.8 billion
pesos from President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Buenos
Aires-based Cronista said.  The province has to pay salaries of 4.5 billion pesos and
an additional 2.25 billion in bonuses. The 1 billion from the
government, in addition to the province’s own resources, is only
sufficient to pay salaries. There is no date set for the bonus
payment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
