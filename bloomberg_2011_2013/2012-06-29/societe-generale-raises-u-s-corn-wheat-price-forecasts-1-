Societe Generale SA (GLE)  raised its price
forecasts for U.S. corn and wheat as dry weather may damage
crops.  Corn may average $7 a bushel in the third quarter, up from
an estimate of $6.20 a bushel, Christopher Narayanan, the bank’s
head of agricultural commodity research, said today in a report.
The grain may average $6.46 in the fourth quarter, compared with
an estimate of $5.72. Corn for December delivery was at $6.335 a
bushel by 11:30 a.m. today on the Chicago Board of Trade.  U.S. corn yields may drop to 155.4 bushels an acre, lower
than the Department of Agriculture’s estimate for a record 166
bushels per acre, because crop conditions have “progressively
worsened” in the second half of June, Narayanan said.  “Given the recent and forecasted weather conditions, we
continue to see downside risk to yields for both corn and
soybeans,” Narayanan wrote. “Additionally, if conditions do
not improve, we would expect to see a higher than normal
abandonment rate, which would net less harvested acreage, adding
another downside risk to production.”  Wheat prices may average $7.87 a bushel in the third
quarter, up from an earlier forecast of $7.25, and $7.84 in the
fourth quarter, an increase from $7.50. September-delivery wheat
traded at $7.5225 today in  Chicago . Both wheat and corn are used
in livestock feed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
