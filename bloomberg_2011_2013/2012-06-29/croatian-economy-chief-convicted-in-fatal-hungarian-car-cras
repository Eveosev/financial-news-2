Croatian Economy Minister Radimir Cacic was convicted in  Hungary  on charges related to a fatal
traffic accident and received a three-year suspended jail
sentence.  Hungarian judge Krisztina Kostyak said Cacic, 63, was
guilty of speeding and causing the accident on a highway in
Hungary in January 2010, in which two Hungarian citizens died.  Cacic has sought to attract foreign investment, which
 Croatia  needs to recover after two years of recession and a
period of stagnation in 2011. The Adriatic Sea nation is set to
become the European Union’s 28th member in July 2013.  Cacic heads the  Croatian People’s Party , the second-most
influential party in the six-month-old  ruling coalition  led by
Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic ’s  Social-Democrats .  Milanovic said earlier this week it would be up to Cacic to
decide whether he would stay in the government, following the
verdict. Cacic has said he would leave his post if the sentence
includes physical jail time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
