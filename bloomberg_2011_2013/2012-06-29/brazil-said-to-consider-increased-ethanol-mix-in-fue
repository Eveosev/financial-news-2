Brazil is considering a request by
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the country’s state-owned oil company,
to increase the amount of ethanol added to gasoline, said two
government officials with knowledge of the discussions.  Authorities are reviewing ethanol supplies in the South
American country to determine if there is enough to proceed with
the measure, which would help reduce imports and boost
Petrobras’s earnings, said the officials, who asked not to be
identified as the matter is not public.  Brazil lowered ethanol levels in gasoline in August because
low stocks were pushing up fuel prices, which is no longer the
case, said  Adriano Pires , head of the Brazilian Center for
Infrastructure.  “The impact on gas prices would be zero,” Pires said by
telephone from  Rio de Janeiro . “The most important thing is
that this would reduce Petrobras’s gasoline imports.”  Petrobras incurred losses of about 750 million reais ($361
million) from fuel imports this year, Pires said. Increased
ethanol levels could cut gas imports by 40 percent, he said.  The state-owned company hasn’t asked for an increase,
Miriam Guaraciaba, a Petrobras spokeswoman, said by telephone
from Rio de Janeiro. Spokesmen at the energy ministry and the
 finance ministry  weren’t immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
