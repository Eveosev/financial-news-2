(Corrects story from June 29 to add detail on increased
expenditures in last paragraph).  The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority said it lost $84 million in 2011 as lower trading
volume reduced revenue from fees and a more risk-averse strategy
shrank returns on its portfolio.  “The broader economic downturn continues to negatively
impact Finra’s funding, resulting in a loss for fiscal year
2011,”  Richard Ketchum , Finra’s chairman and chief executive,
said in the organization’s annual report released today.  Finra, which earned $54.6 million in 2010, oversees more
than 4,000 brokers and funds itself through fees on the
industry, including trades conducted by its members, and income
from its investments. The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission oversees Finra’s activities and must sign off on the
rules it proposes.  Finra sought SEC approval in April for an increase in
trading and other fees to help offset the revenue loss.  The organization will pay Ketchum a $1 million salary in
2012, according to the report, along with almost $1.3 million in
incentive compensation. Finra’s vice chairman Stephen Luparello
will receive a compensation package worth almost $1.3 million
this year and Todd Diganci, the executive vice president and
chief financial officer, will earn almost $1.2 million.  The 2011 loss stemmed in part from increased expenses
related to Finra’s “strategic initiatives.” That includes
$16.1 million for a  data center  and $26.8 million to increase
the organization’s “surveillance capabilities” for the  New
York  Stock Exchange and  Nasdaq , the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
