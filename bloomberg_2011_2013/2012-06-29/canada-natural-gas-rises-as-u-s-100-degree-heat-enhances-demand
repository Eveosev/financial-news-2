Canadian natural gas rose to the
highest price in more than a month as hot weather that may boost
demand from  power plants  for air conditioners was forecast for
most of the U.S.,  Canada ’s largest export market.  August gas in  Alberta  advanced 2.8 percent to the highest
month-end price this year as most of Canada and the U.S. were
expected to have temperatures 3 degrees Fahrenheit (2 Celsius)
to 14 degrees higher than normal through July 8, according to
MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland.  “I still think there’s enough heat in the forecast to keep
it up regardless of the storage concerns,” Carl Neill, a
consultant with Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta, said in a
telephone interview. “You just have so much heat out there for
such an extended period of time, it will be difficult to sell it
down too much until that abates.”  Alberta gas for August delivery increased 6 cents to
C$2.215 per gigajoule ($2.06 per million British thermal units)
as of 4:45 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Alberta gas has fallen 14 percent this year, from C$2.58 on
Dec. 31, and advanced 36 percent in the second quarter, from
C$1.625 at the end of March.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 10.2 cents to settle at $2.824 per million Btu.  The Energy Department reported yesterday  U.S. stockpiles 
grew by 57 billion cubic feet to 3.063 trillion in the week
ended June 22. Inventories were 25 percent above the five-year
average for the week, down from 27 percent the previous period.  Cooling Demand  Weather Derivatives of Belton,  Missouri , predicted cooling
demand will be 56 percent above normal in the Midwest, Canada’s
largest export market, through July 6.  “The heat early on will contain ongoing opportunities for
highs near or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in  St. Louis , where
worsening drought will help enhance already hot conditions,”
Travis Hartman, a meteorologist with MDA EarthSat, wrote today
in a forecast for July 4 to July 8.  The high in St Louis today may be 104 degrees, 16 above
normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
 Pennsylvania . Temperatures of 100 or higher are forecast for
that city through July 3, the service said.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
8.84 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.7983 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 4.74 cents to $2.4565 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, prices dropped 5.22 cents to $2.5899.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet at 4:30 p.m.  New York  time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.75 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.03 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 617 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 2 billion cubic feet today, or 76 percent of
normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.89
billion cubic feet at 3:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
