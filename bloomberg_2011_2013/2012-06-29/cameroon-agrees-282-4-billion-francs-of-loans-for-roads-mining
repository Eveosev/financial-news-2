Cameroon borrowed 282.4 billion
francs ($539 million) from China, France and the  World Bank  to
finance road, mining and social projects in the Central African
nation, Planning Minister Emmanuel Nganou Djoumessi said.  The government signed a 242 billion-franc loan with the
Export-Import Bank of China to build a 260-kilometer (162-mile)
multiple-lane highway between Yaounde and the port city of
Douala, Djoumessi told reporters yesterday in the capital.  In a second agreement, the French Development Agency agreed
to provide 13.6 billion francs to finance agriculture projects
in rural areas, he said. The European Union will also disburse
11.8 billion CFA francs to build a road between Maroua and Maga
in northern Cameroon, according to Djoumessi. A fourth 15
billion-franc accord was signed with the World Bank to finance
projects in the  mining industry , Djoumessi said, without
providing further details.  Economic growth in Cameroon, Africa’s fourth-biggest cocoa
grower, is expected to accelerate to 4.5 percent in 2013 from an
estimated 4.1 percent this year, according to the  International
Monetary Fund . The country is rated B by Standard and Poor’s and
Fitch, five levels below investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
