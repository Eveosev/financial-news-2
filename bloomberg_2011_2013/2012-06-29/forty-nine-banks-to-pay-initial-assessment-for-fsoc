The U.S. Treasury Department said 49
financial firms next month will begin paying to cover the
expenses of a council of regulators and its research arm.  Twenty-five U.S. bank holding companies and 24 foreign
firms will be assessed about $7,700 per $1 billion in assets
beginning July 20, the Treasury said in a statement today. That
initial assessment totaling $137 million will cover expenses of
the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of
Financial Research, the Treasury said.  The council, created by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul
law to help prevent another financial crisis, includes Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke . Geithner is the councilâ€™s chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
