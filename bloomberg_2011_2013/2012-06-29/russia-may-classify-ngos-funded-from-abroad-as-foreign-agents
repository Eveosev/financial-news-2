Russia’s ruling United Russia party
said it would propose legislation to classify all non-
governmental organizations that receive financial aid from
abroad as “foreign agents.”  If passed, the bill would require that NGOs publish twice-
yearly reports on their activities and conduct annual audits,
United Russia lawmaker Alexander Sidyakin said in a statement
published today on the party’s  website .  “There’s a whole network of NGOs whose financing is
suspicious from the point of view of its provider,” he said,
according to the statement.  Thousands of Russians have taken to the streets to protest
against President  Vladimir Putin  in the country’s biggest
demonstrations in a decade. Putin, who returned to the Kremlin
this year for a third term, signed off June 8 on a separate bill
that increased fines for breaking protest laws to 300,000 rubles
($9,254) from 2,000 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
