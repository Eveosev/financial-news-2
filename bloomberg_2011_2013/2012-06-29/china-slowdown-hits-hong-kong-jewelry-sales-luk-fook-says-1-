Chinese tourists are spending less
money in  Hong Kong  as the mainland economy slows, weakening
demand for jewelry, said Wong Wai Sheung, chief executive
officer of  Luk Fook Holdings (International) Ltd. (590)   Sales at Luk Fook’s stores, mostly in Hong Kong and the
mainland, may grow less than 10 percent for the rest of 2012
compared to the same period a year earlier, Wong said at a press
briefing in Hong Kong yesterday. That compares with a 47 percent
gain in the year ended March 31.  “Visitor arrivals are growing, but as the Chinese economy
is slowing, the mainland shoppers in Hong Kong are not splashing
out as much,” Wong said. “I’m not too optimistic about the
jewelry market this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
