OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA
named a new chief executive officer after a plunge in shares
wiped out $3.8 billion of founder  Eike Batista ’s wealth.  Luiz Carneiro will replace Paulo Mendonca, who will assume
a post as special adviser to Batista, the company said yesterday
in a regulatory filing. Carneiro, who had served as the CEO and
president of  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , Batista’s shipbuilding company, will
be replaced by Carlos Bellot, according to a separate filing.  Carneiro is a mechanical engineer with an MBA from Columbia
University and also held management positions in Brazil’s state
 oil company  Petrobras, as Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo
Brasileiro SA is known, before working for Batista’s companies.
Bellot previously served as OSX’s operations director and worked
for more than 30 years at Petrobras, according to OSX’s website.  OGX shares lost 40 percent of their value over the past two
days after the oil company cut production targets at its first
two wells by as much as 75 percent. The decline dragged down
Batista’s mining, logistics and shipbuilding companies on
concern the enterprises, some of which rely on OGX for revenue,
will scale back targets as well.  The share plunge pushed Batista out of the world’s 20
richest people, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  Batista, 55, emerged as Brazil’s richest man by building an
empire of interlinked oil, mining, shipbuilding and logistics
companies to harness the nation’s natural resources.  To contact the reporters on this story:
