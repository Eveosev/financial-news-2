Strabag AG, the German unit of
 Austria â€™s biggest builder, said it will sell two subsidiaries in
order to focus on transport construction.  The unit said it will sell Dusseldorf, Germany-based HEILIT
Umwelttechnik GmbH and Prague-based Dalnicni Stavby Praha AS, in
an e-mailed statement today. While details of the sales are yet
to be finalized, the two transactions should be completed in the
second half of 2012, the company said.  The sales should result in income of at least 140 million
euros ($177 million), the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
