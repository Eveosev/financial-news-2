Sam Mikulak had the best all-around
score of 91.800 on the opening day of the men’s U.S. Olympic
gymnastic trials, which will select a team of five Americans for
the London Games.  Fifteen competitors are vying in the trials at the HP
Pavilion in  San Jose , California. Five women also will be chosen,
with their competition beginning today.  Mikulak, 19, the 2011 National Collegiate Athletic
Association champion at the  University of Michigan , broke both
his ankles at a meet in Puerto Rico last year.  Mikulak’s score yesterday put him in third place in the
overall standings, which include scores from the national
championships this month. The finals are tomorrow, after which
the team will be announced.  Danell Leyva leads the overall standings with 276.500
points after yesterday’s 91.700 score. John Orozco is second
overall, with 275.550 points after a 90.700 in the prelims.
Mikulak’s overall score is 274.650.  To contact the reporter on this story:
