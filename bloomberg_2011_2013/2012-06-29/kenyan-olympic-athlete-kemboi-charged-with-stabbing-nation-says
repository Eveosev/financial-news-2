Kenyan athlete Ezekiel Kemboi, the
world 3,000-meter steeplechase champion, was charged with
stabbing a woman and will appear in court on Sept. 25, the  Daily
Nation  reported, citing Magistrate Francis Kyambia.  Ann Njeri, the victim of the attack, said she was assaulted
after she and Kemboi left a bar in the southwestern town of
Eldoret on June 27, the Nairobi-based newspaper said. Kemboi
denied the charges and was released on cash bail of 20,000
shillings ($238) or a 50,000-shilling bond, it said.  Kemboi asked for his case to be deferred so he can compete
in the London Olympics, which begin on July 27, the newspaper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
