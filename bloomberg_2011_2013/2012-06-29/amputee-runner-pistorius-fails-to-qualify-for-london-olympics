Oscar Pistorius, the South African
trying to become the first amputee runner to compete at the
Olympics, failed today to qualify for the 400 meters at the
London Games.  Pistorius, who runs with J-shaped carbon-fiber blades, had
a time of 45.52 seconds at the African track championships in
 Benin . He needed to run a time of 45.30 for a second time in
international competition to meet the criteria for the Olympics.  It was the 25-year-old’s last qualifying chance after
running 45.20 seconds at a meet in March to get in contention
for an Olympic berth.  Known as the “ Blade Runner ,” Pistorius was born without
fibulas and had both legs amputated below the knee when he was
11 months old. In 2008 the Court of Arbitration for Sport in
2008 overturned a ban on him by the International Association of
Athletics Federations, track and field’s ruling body, which said
the blades gave him an advantage.  Pistorius has qualified to defend his Paralympics titles in
the 100, 200 and 400 meters. The  Olympic Games  will be held July
27 to Aug. 12, with the Paralympics Games scheduled for Aug. 29
to Sept. 9 in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
