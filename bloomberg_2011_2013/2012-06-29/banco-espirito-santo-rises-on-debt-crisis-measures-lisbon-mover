Banco Espirito Santo SA, Portugal’s
biggest publicly traded bank by market value, rose the most in
more than three weeks after European leaders agreed to ease
repayment rules for emergency loans to Spanish lenders.  Banco Espirito climbed 6.7 percent to 53.8 euro cents in
Lisbon trading, the biggest gain since June 5, giving the bank a
market value of 2.16 billion euros ($2.7 billion).  “The decision by EU leaders to ease the terms on loans to
Spanish banks is boosting the banking sector in the euro area,
including in Portugal,” said  Pedro Oliveira , a trader at Go
Bulling in Lisbon.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  increased 1 percent to 9.8
cents and  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  rose 8.2 percent to 53.8 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
