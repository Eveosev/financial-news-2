The new chairman of the  Bankia (BKIA) 
group, sunk by real estate losses that led it to be nationalized
by the Spanish government, told shareholders he “profoundly”
regretted their losses and pledged to turn round the business.  Bankia will seek to reduce its 60 billion euros ($75
billion) of non-yielding assets by more than half over three
years and improve its cost-to-income  ratio  to 40 percent from
almost 60 percent over the same period, Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri said today in a speech to shareholders in
 Valencia ,  Spain . Police stood by as customers and employees
protested outside and some shareholders inside the hall shouted
“out, out” as he spoke.  “I am also conscious of the losses that you have had in
your investments in Bankia in recent months and I profoundly
regret them,” Goirigolzarri said. “Our objective is that at
the end of the next three years, Bankia, the company of which
you are owners, will achieve a return on equity that’s in line
with the average of the best competitors of the Spanish
financial system.”  The government took over Spain’s third-biggest banking
group last month after the  International Monetary Fund  called
for action to strengthen its balance sheet and management as
losses linked to real estate mounted. The group’s publicly
traded bank, Bankia SA, raised more than 3 billion euros with a
sale of shares last July that left shareholders, including many
of its own customers, with losses of more than 75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
