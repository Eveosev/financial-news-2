The U.S. House of Representatives
today approved a bill that will keep money flowing for highway
and mass transit projects for the next 27 months. Lawmakers
acted a day before the programs were due to expire.  The legislation, passed on a 373-52 vote, overhauls how
projects undergo review for their effect on the environment. It
will consolidate the number of programs dedicated to specific
policy priorities and give states more flexibility to skip
federal mandates on bicycle paths and pedestrian walkways.  Besides transportation-related programs, the legislation
extends for a year current student-loan interest rates, which
had been scheduled to double to 6.8 percent on July 1. The
measure also reauthorizes the National Flood Insurance Program,
which had been set to expire at the end of July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
