The lira rebounded from its weakest
in almost three weeks and bonds rose after  Turkey ’s trade
deficit fell from a year ago and European leaders agreed on
measures to support Spain’s banks, boosting demand for riskier
assets.  The Turkish currency gained for the first time in three
days, up 1.1 percent to 1.8078 per dollar at 6:07 p.m. in
Istanbul, paring its quarterly fall to 1.4 percent. It closed at
1.8275 per dollar yesterday, the lowest since June 11. Yields on
two-year benchmark bonds slipped for a fourth day, down 14 basis
points to 8.47 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 14,
extending the slide in the three months to 84 basis points.  The  trade gap  fell 16 percent to $8.6 billion in May from
$10.2 billion a year earlier, the statistics office in Ankara
said on its website today, lagging the $6.6 billion shortfall in
April. It accounts for a major proportion of the  current-account
deficit , which shrank for a sixth month in April, helping the
lira appreciate 4 percent this year.  “The gradual fall in the 12-month foreign trade deficit
continues although we saw a deficit higher than our expectations
for the month,” Basak Karaaslan, an economist at Finansbank AS,
said in e-mailed comments. “We expect the slowdown in domestic
demand and the retreating global energy prices to limit the fall
import bill and continuation of the 12-month deficit.”  Crude, Commodities Drop  Crude  oil prices  have plunged 23 percent this quarter,
heading for the biggest drop since the final three months of
2008. Turkey imports almost all of the oil it consumes. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials has
dropped 16 percent from this year’s highest close of 715.52 on
Feb. 24.  Turkey is “decelerating toward a soft landing,” the
 International Monetary Fund  said in a statement June 8. The
economy grew 8.5 percent in 2011, the third-fastest pace in the
world behind China and  Argentina , and 9.2 percent in 2010,
according to the state statistics agency.  European leaders grew closer to solving the debt crisis,
dropping requirements that governments received preferred
creditor status on crisis loans to  Spain ’s banks and relaxing
conditions on potential help for  Italy .  The central bank lent 5 billion liras ($2.8 billion) today
at 5.75 percent in its one-week repurchase agreements auction
and 4 billion liras in one-month repo auction at 9.94 percent.  The bank varies its funding rate daily, maintaining
borrowing costs within a 5.75 percent to 11.5 percent interest-
rate corridor introduced last year. It has lent at the lowest
policy rate for 19 consecutive days, lowering borrowing costs
for lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
