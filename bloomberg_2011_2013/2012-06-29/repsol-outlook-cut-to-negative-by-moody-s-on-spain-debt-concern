  Repsol SA (REP) , the Spanish oil company
whose  YPF SA (YPFD)  unit was seized by Argentina, had the outlook on
its  credit rating  cut to negative from stable by Moody’s
Investors Service because of concern about contagion from the
sovereign debt crisis.  Moody’s has a Baa3 rating on Repsol bonds, the lowest
investment grade. Repsol shares have lost almost half their
market value this year after Argentina nationalized the
company’s YPF unit and benchmark Brent oil futures fell about 11
percent, depressing its revenue outlook.  Spain’s biggest oil producer last month lowered its
dividend payout ratio to protect its credit ratings. Spanish
government debt yields rose to a euro-era record earlier this
month as the  European debt crisis  intensified.  “The further downgrade of Spain’s sovereign rating may
heighten the risks associated with the execution of the
corrective actions initiated by Repsol in response to the YPF
expropriation, as it seeks to cut debt and conserve cash,” the
ratings agency said in a statement in London.  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings also have Repsol on the
lowest investment grade. S&P changed the outlook from negative
to stable on June 22, citing confidence that Repsol’s management
will be able to reduce debt this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
