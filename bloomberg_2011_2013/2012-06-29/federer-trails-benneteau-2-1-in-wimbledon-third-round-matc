Six-time Wimbledon champion  Roger
Federer  trails 29th seed Julien Benneteau of  France  two sets to
one after winning the third in their third-round match at the
All England Club.  Benneteau leads the Swiss player 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 2-6 under
a closed roof on Centre Court. A loss today for Federer would be
his earliest in a major since the 2004 French Open, when he was
defeated by Gustavo Keurten in the third round.  Federer, 30, has come back from two sets down seven times
in his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
