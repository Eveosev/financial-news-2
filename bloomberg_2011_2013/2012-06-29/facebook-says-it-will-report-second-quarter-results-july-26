Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
largest social-networking service, said it will release second-
quarter results on July 26, 2012.  The company’s first earnings report since it sold shares in
an initial public offering will take place after the close of
trading that day, according to a post on Facebook’s investor
relations Web page.  Investors will scour results for the Menlo Park,
California-based company for any signs whether a growth slowdown
persisted into the three-month period that ended in June.
Revenue rose 45 percent in the first quarter, compared with 55
percent in the fourth quarter. Sales more than doubled
in each of the three periods before that.  To contact the reporter on this story:
