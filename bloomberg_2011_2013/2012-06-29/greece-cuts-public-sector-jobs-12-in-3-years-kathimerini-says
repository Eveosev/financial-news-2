Greece  will have shed 12 percent of
its public-sector workforce in three years by the end of 2012,
 Kathimerini  said, citing a report by the European Commission,
the  European Central Bank  and the International Monetary Fund.  The public-sector workforce, including people working at
state-controlled companies, will total 770,481 by the year-end,
down from 876,732 in December 2009, the newspaper said.  The number of people working for general government at the
end of the year will be 701,924, down from 717,792 12 months
earlier; the number at state-controlled companies will drop to
68,557 from 69,935, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
