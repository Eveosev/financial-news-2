The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  and Australia from default climbed,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia  index  increased 2.5 basis
points to 192 as of 10:28 a.m. in Sydney,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
prices show. The gauge is on course for its highest close since
June 14, and has risen 44 basis points since April through
yesterday, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia  index  of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 1 basis point to 183 as of 8:28
a.m. in Singapore, Credit Agricole prices show. The index, which
fell for three straight days through yesterday, traded in a
153.5 to 210 basis-point range since the end of March, according
to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan   index  was little changed at 186
basis points as of 9:18 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The benchmark has fallen from a seven-month high of 217
basis points on May 18, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  All three indexes are headed for their first three-month
increase since the quarter ended September, the data show.
Contracts on Japanese companies increased 31 and the Asia index
climbed 22 in the period, according to CMA data.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
