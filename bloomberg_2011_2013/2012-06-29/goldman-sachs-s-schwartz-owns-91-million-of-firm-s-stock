Mark Schwartz , re-hired by  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  this month to run its business in Asia, owns
about $91 million of stock in the bank, according to a filing.  Schwartz, 57, holds 949,028 shares directly and 4,000
shares through trusts established for his family, according to
the  filing  with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman
Sachs closed at $95.86 in New York, where the firm is based.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on Schwartz’s stake.  Schwartz, now based in Beijing, worked at Goldman Sachs
from 1979 until his departure in 2001. He became chairman of the
Asia business and a member of the bank’s management committee in
1999, the same year that Goldman Sachs went public.  In his new role, he fills a position previously held by J.  Michael Evans , who is now based in New York as vice chairman and
global head of growth markets. Schwartz was also named vice
chairman.  Evans owned 1,541,341 shares of Goldman Sachs as of March
26, according to the company’s proxy filing earlier this year.
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein owned 3,152,524
shares and President Gary D. Cohn owned 1,831,566 shares,
according to the proxy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
