Kenya ’s shilling strengthened the
most in more than a week, paring its quarterly decline, as the
central bank withdrew liquidity for a second consecutive day,
curbing total  money supply .  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
0.3 percent to 84.10 by 2:18 p.m. in Nairobi, the biggest gain
on a closing basis since June 20, trimming its depreciation in
the second quarter to 1.6 percent.  Kenya tightened supply by accepting 3.5 billion shillings
($41.6 million) of bids for  repurchase agreements  maturing in
seven days at a weighted average rate of 17.525 percent, a
central bank official who asked not to be named in line with
policy said today. Bids received totaled 12.3 billion shillings.
The sale today is the second auction after the bank stayed out
for five days since June 20 through June 26, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The bank also accepted 3 billion shillings of bids for 28-
day term-auction deposits at 17.49 percent, 250 million
shillings for 21-day TADs at 17.5 percent and 250 million
shillings for 14-day TADs at a weighted average rate of 17.25
percent, the official said.  Longer-tenure term auction deposits have been introduced
“as an additional instrument for liquidity management,” the
bank said June 5.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened 0.1 percent to 1,572.50 per
dollar, cutting its appreciation in the second quarter to 1.2
percent.  Uganda ’s shilling gained for the first time in five
days, up 0.2 percent to 2,467.90 per dollar, increasing its
advance in the three months to 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
