European stocks  rallied the most in
seven months after policy makers eased repayment rules for
Spanish banks, relaxed conditions for possible aid to  Italy  and
unveiled a $149 billion growth plan for the region’s economy.  Banco Santander SA paced banks higher, jumping 6.9 percent,
after euro-area leaders at a summit in Brussels dropped a

the close of trading, capping a weekly gain of 1.9 percent. The
benchmark gauge jumped 4.8 percent this month as Greece formed a
coalition government after its second election in six weeks,
easing concern the nation will leave the euro.  “The European summit has given a very precious chance to
Italy and Spain,” said Theodore Krintas, managing director of
Attica Wealth Management, which manages 100 million euros ($126
million). “They’re addressing directly the needs of both
countries to reduce their funding costs. They will be addressing
all other banking unification issues in a very short period of
time. By European standards, this is a quick move.”  The Stoxx 600, which climbed 7.7 percent in the first
quarter for the best start to a year since 2006, lost 4.6

surged and political discord persisted in  Greece .  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
gauge today was 35 percent higher than the average of the last
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Creditor Status  After talks that stretched till this morning, leaders of
the 17 euro nations dropped the requirement that governments get
preferred-creditor status on crisis loans to Spain’s banks and

funds once  Europe  sets up a single banking supervisor.  The leaders also discussed reducing the market pressure on
Italy and Spain by allowing them to access rescue loans without
relinquishing control of their economies.  European Union leaders late yesterday approved a 120
