United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, is considering building a new smelter
to replace the aging facility at its Bogoslovsk plant in
 Russia ’s Sverdlovsk region.  After a feasibility study, it would take as long as 5 years
to construct a smelter with annual capacity of 396,000 metric
tons of aluminum, Rusal said in a  statement  on its website
today.  A decision to proceed would only be taken if Rusal was able
to agree on low-cost electricity supplies for the plant with the
regional government.  The Bogoslovsk smelter was built in the 1940s and, given
current market conditions and aluminum prices, is one of the
least efficient among Rusal’s units, according to a statement
from the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
