European Union carbon permits, on
track to be the world’s fastest-rising commodity in June,
approached their highest in more than three months as the bloc
unveiled a $149 billion growth plan for the region’s economy.  Allowances for December jumped as much as 29 cents to 8.28
euros ($10.40) a metric ton and were at 8.08 euros as of 10:10
a.m. on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . They’ve
gained 27 percent this month. United Nations emission credits
are ranked second-fastest for the month, rising 20 percent.  The two carbon benchmarks beat U.S. corn’s 19 percent
increase, U.S. natural gas’s 15 percent advance and U.S. wheat’s
14 percent rise, according to price data for 80 commodities
compiled by Bloomberg. The worst performer was  gasoline  traded
in  Singapore , which fell 14 percent. Brent crude oil traded on
ICE has declined 8.5 percent.  “Carbon has continued to hold up in the face of weak
energy markets and continuing concerns about the debt-laden  euro
zone ,”  Matthew Gray , an analyst in London at Jefferies Bache
Ltd., said today in an e-mailed research note. “With regulatory
intervention in sight, carbon has no reason to follow its
traditional price-drivers with any real conviction.”  Carbon allowances jumped June 25 to their highest in more
than three months in intraday trading as regulators in Brussels
considered temporarily withholding supply sold in auctions in
the three years starting next year. The bloc is seeking to fix
an oversupply in the market, which otherwise will extend beyond
2020, according to a June 22 forecast by  Trevor Sikorski ,
Barclays Plc’s analyst in London. Regulators have proposed to
detail a plan by the end of next month.  UN emission credits for December gained 3 cents to 4.05
euros a ton as of 10:08 a.m. on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
