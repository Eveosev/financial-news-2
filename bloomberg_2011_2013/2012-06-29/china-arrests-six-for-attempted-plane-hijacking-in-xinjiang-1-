Chinese police arrested six suspects
for trying to hijack an airplane in the northwestern region of
Xinjiang today, the official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing
local authorities.  The suspects were overpowered by the crew and passengers
upon attempting to hijack the Tianjin Airlines plane 10 minutes
after the flight took off at 12:25 p.m. from the Hotan Airport
en route to the regional capital of Urumqi, Xinhua said. At
least 10 of the 100 people on board were injured and the flight
returned to land safely in Hotan, it said.  The incident may add to unrest in a region beset by tension
between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and ethnic Han
Chinese, whom the government has encouraged to migrate to
Xinjiang. Riots in the territory left at least 12 people dead in
February, according to the official Xinhua.  Xinjiang was the scene of clashes in 2009 between Uighurs
and Han Chinese that left almost 200 people dead in Urumqi.
Separate disturbances in July and August killed 22 people,
Xinhua reported at the time.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
