China arrested more than 1,700
suspects in 900 cases in this year’s crackdown on counterfeit
and substandard agricultural products, Xinhua News Agency said,
citing the Ministry of Public Security.  Confiscations in the cases resulted in “retrieving
economic losses” of 300 million  yuan  ($47 million), the
official news service said. The ministry plans to continue the
crackdown with “severe” punishments for violators, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
