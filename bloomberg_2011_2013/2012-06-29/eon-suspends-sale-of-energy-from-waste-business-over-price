EON AG,  Germany ’s largest utility,
suspended the planned sale of its energy-from-waste unit after
failing to get the right price.  “The energy-from-waste unit is currently not for sale,”
Christian Drepper, a Dusseldorf-based company spokesman, said
today in a telephone interview. “We have received several
offers for the business, but we also repeatedly said that we are
under no pressure to sell and that we won’t do so at any
price.”  EON was seeking to raise more than 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) from the sale that had been complicated by volatile
incineration rates and earnings as well as differences over
price, according to people familiar with the process earlier
this week.  German utility company MVV Energie AG, Swedish buyout firm
EQT Partners AB, Morgan Stanley’s infrastructure fund and
SembCorp Industries Ltd., a Singapore-based energy and water
company, had handed in offers for the unit, the people said.  The unit operates 18 incineration plants with a capacity of
about 4 million tons, generating about 2,100 gigawatt hours of
electricity and about 2,800 gigawatt hours of heat, according to
its website. The unit had 544 million euros in sales in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
