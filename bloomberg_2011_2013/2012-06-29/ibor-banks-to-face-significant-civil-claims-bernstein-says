Barclays Plc (BARC)  and other banks that
settle regulators’ allegations they attempted to manipulate a
key London borrowing rate will face “significant civil claims”
in coming years, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
analysts.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest lender, was fined a
record $451 million this week after investigators found traders
and senior managers tried to rig the London interbank offered
rate and the euro interbank offered rate, known as Libor and
Euribor.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
 ICAP Plc (IAP) ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  are
among the firms regulators are investigating.  “This is a major regulatory issue for the Libor banks that
will likely generate significant civil claims over the next four
to five years,” Bernstein analysts led by Brad Hintz wrote in a
research note today. “Investors should not minimize the
importance of this matter.”  The analysts’ report cites  studies  whose results “imply
that the Barclays manipulation was probably successful and
further imply that more than just one bank was involved in the
scheme.” Barclays and regulators haven’t said the attempted
manipulation was successful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
