Low rainfall in  South Africa  is
expected to curb the nationâ€™s corn surplus to 1 million metric
tons, Business Day reported, citing Grain SA Chief Executive
Officer Jannie de Villiers.  Yields per hectare are expected to be lower than last year,
the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  Of the expected output of 11 million tons of corn South
Africa is expected to produce this season, at least 1 million
tons will be for export, with Botswana, Lesotho,  Namibia  and
Swaziland importing 400,000 tons, de Villiers said, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
