The following is the text of
 Canada â€™s manufacturing shipments report for May released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales increased 0.7% to $48.6 billion in May,
the second gain in five months.  Sales were up in 11 of 21 industries, representing about
57% of the manufacturing sector. Sales of durable goods were up
1.3% while non-durable goods sales edged up 0.2%.  Constant dollar sales increased 0.7% as volumes rose.  Chemical manufacturing leads the gains  The  chemical industry  posted the largest sales gain in
dollar terms. Sales in the industry were up $195 million to $4.0
billion, the 8th increase in 12 months. The gain in May mainly
reflected a larger than usual increase in fertilizer sales.
Wetter and colder weather this year delayed spring planting.
Hence, the annual ramp-up in fertilizer production occurred
later this year than in previous years.  Sales of primary metals rose 4.0% in May to $3.5 billion,
partially rebounding from a 9.1% drop in April. In the machinery
and fabricated metal products industries, sales increased 3.8%
and 3.4% respectively. In all three industries, higher volumes
of products sold were responsible for the gains.  A 4.8% decline in sales to $2.1 billion in the wood product
industry offset some of the sales increases. The decrease
followed seven months of advances. Notwithstanding the decline,
wood product sales were 26.5% higher compared with May 2012.  Sales in the  food industry  were down 1.3% to $7.3 billion
in May, the lowest level since November 2012.  Sales gains led by Ontario  Sales were up in six provinces, led by Ontario,  Alberta  and
Saskatchewan.  In Ontario, sales rose 1.9% to $22.7 billion, reaching
their highest level since November 2012. The gain mainly
reflected increases in the petroleum and coal product (+8.7%),
motor vehicle assembly (+2.0%), and chemical (+3.9%) industries.  Sales in Alberta advanced 2.1% to $6.2 billion. The
increase was caused by higher sales in the petroleum and coal
product (+5.8%) and chemical (+7.5%) industries.  Saskatchewan manufacturers reported a 5.8% rise in sales.
The gain mainly reflected increases in the non-durable goods
industries.  In  Quebec , sales fell 2.8% to $10.7 billion, the 10th
decline in 12 months. This decrease stemmed from lower sales in
the petroleum and coal product industry. In May, Quebec
manufacturing sales were at their lowest level since September
2009.  Inventories edge down  Inventories edged down 0.2% to $69.0 billion, the first
decline after four months of gains. In the primary metal
industry, inventories were down 3.3% to $7.4 billion. Lower
inventories of paper (-2.3%) and non-metallic mineral products
(-3.8%) also contributed to the decline in total inventories.  However, a 2.5% advance in goods-in-process inventories in
the aerospace product and parts industry partly offset the
declines. In addition, total inventories were up in the chemical
(+1.3%) and computer and electronic product (+1.8%) industries.  The inventory-to-sales ratio decreased slightly to 1.42 in
May from 1.43 in April. The values for the ratio in April and
May were the highest since the autumn of 2009.  Unfilled orders rise  Unfilled orders increased 0.6% to $71.2 billion, as a
result of gains in the transportation equipment industry.
Unfilled orders were also up in the primary metal industry.  The increase in unfilled orders for transportation
equipment reflected a 1.2% advance in the aerospace product and
parts industry. Aerospace unfilled orders reached $39.0 billion
in May, the highest level ever recorded for the industry.
Unfilled orders also rose in the ship and boat building industry.  In the primary metal industry, unfilled orders rose 8.3% to
$1.3 billion. The gain was the largest since November 2011.  A portion of the gains in total unfilled orders was offset
by a 1.9% decline in the machinery industry.  New orders increased 1.8% to $49.0 billion in May. The
increase reflected gains in the transportation equipment,
primary metal, fabricated metal product and chemical industries.  Note to readers  Monthly data in this release are seasonally adjusted and
are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified.  Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and
tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing,
leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support
activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics
and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal
products, machinery, computer and electronic products,
electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation
equipment, furniture and related products and miscellaneous
manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the  aerospace industry  and shipbuilding industries, the
value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting monthly
sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories
of goods in process and finished products manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute
to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the current
month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for
the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the
previous month to the current month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
