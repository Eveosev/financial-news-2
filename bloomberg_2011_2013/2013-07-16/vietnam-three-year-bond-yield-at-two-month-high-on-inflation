Vietnam’s government bonds fell,
driving the three-year yield to the highest since May, on
speculation inflation will quicken. The dong was steady.  Consumer-price gains  accelerated last month for the first
time since January, rising 6.69 percent from a year earlier,
official data show. They may increase 6.69 percent to 7.3
percent in July, Saigon Securities Inc. said in a research note
released today.  “We have to accept the fact that inflation is edging
higher in the second half of the year,” Saigon Securities said
in the note.  The yield on the three-year securities rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.7 percent, the highest
since May 10, according to a daily fixing from lenders compiled
by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 21,223 per dollar as of 4:17 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 21,219 yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The State Bank of  Vietnam  set its reference rate
at 21,036, unchanged since June 28, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the daily fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
