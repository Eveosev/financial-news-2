Repower Systems SE, a unit of
 India ’s  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , installed the last turbines at a
325-megawatt wind farm off  Belgium .  The  Thornton Bank  project has 48 turbines of 6 megawatts
each, currently the largest machines available for commercial
wind parks, Hamburg-based Repower said in a  statement . Developer
C-Power counts Repower,  RWE AG (RWE) ’s Innogy unit and EDF Energies
Nouvelles SA among its shareholders.  The project will supply enough electricity for 600,000
people, Repower said yesterday. Belgium connected 185 megawatts
of offshore wind to the grid last year, more than any other
European Union country apart from Britain, according to the
European Wind Energy Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
