Citigroup Inc. (C) , the U.S. lender that
 operates  in more than 160 countries, named Ashish Bajaj to head
its Asia-Pacific commercial bank as it seeks more revenue from
small and medium sized companies in the region.  Bajaj, 49, replaced Gaurang Hattangdi, who has become the
bank’s global head of product development for commercial
banking, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
James Griffiths, a Hong Kong-based spokesman at Citi, confirmed
the appointments.  Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat  said in May he’s
devoting “meaningful” resources to expand Asia-Pacific
operations. Citicorp, which comprises the group’s core business
including the commercial banking unit, generated $1.07 billion
of  profit  from Asia last quarter, compared with $972 million a
year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Bajaj, a 26-year veteran at Citigroup, will remain in Hong
Kong, where he was most recently regional head of relationship
management for financial institutions in Asia Pacific, the
person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
