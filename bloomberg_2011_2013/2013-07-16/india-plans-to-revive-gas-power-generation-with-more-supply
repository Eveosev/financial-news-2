Indian ministers will consider
reallocating natural gas to factories and power plants at a
meeting tomorrow, as supplies dwindle from the nation’s biggest
deposit of the cleaner burning fuel.  A group of ministers led by Defense Minister A.K. Antony is
scheduled to meet in New Delhi to discuss the reallocation, Oil
Minister Veerappa Moily, also a part of the group, told
reporters in New Delhi today. He declined to say how much gas
may be given to power stations lying idle for want of fuel.  A decline in gas output for three years from the Reliance
Industries Ltd.-operated field in the  Bay of Bengal  has affected
supply to power stations, oil refineries and steel plants,
forcing them to either shut down or buy more expensive gas from
overseas. Production from the KG-D6 field off  India ’s east coast
has dropped more than 75 percent in the past three years.
Reliance says the field has proved more difficult to produce
from then initially envisioned.  The government currently prioritizes gas supplies to
fertilizer makers, followed by liquefied petroleum gas
extractors and power generators. India had 20,359 megawatts of
gas-based electricity generating capacity, or 9 percent of the
total, as of the end of May, according to Central Electricity
Authority  data .  Gas production from Reliance’s KG-D6 field declined 39
percent to 336 billion cubic feet in the 12 months ended March
31 from a year earlier, the company said April 16. The drop was
spurred by reservoir complexity and a natural decline in output,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
