HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) , the largest for-profit U.S. hospital chain, climbed the most in 11 weeks after
preliminary second-quarter earnings beat analysts’ estimates on
an increase in patient admissions.  HCA rose 4.4 percent to $38.86 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest single-day increase since April 29. Second-quarter
revenue was about $8.45 billion, helped by a 1.3 percent gain in
same-facility admissions, the Nashville, Tennessee-based company
said today in a statement.  Net income for the quarter was about 91 cents a share,
topping by 13 cents the average of analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. The company reiterated its forecast for 2013
earnings excluding one-time items of $3 to $3.30 a share.  “It’s significantly better than expected,”  Sheryl Skolnick , an analyst at  Stamford , Connecticut-based CRT Capital
Group LLC, said in an interview. “Volume helped, but what
really helped was cost control, the stranglehold on costs. And
cost containment is otherwise known as good management.”  Same facility equivalent admissions also increased, gaining
1.1 percent.  “We view the company’s strong second-quarter results as a
key catalyst that underscores the company’s strong outlook,”
Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. said in a note
today to investors.  HCA said it plans to report full second-quarter results
around Aug. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
