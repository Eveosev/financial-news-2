Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the
world’s biggest dairy exporter, will cut prices for its maternal
health products in  China , becoming the sixth foreign company to
do so after the government started a probe into possible price-fixing.  The Auckland, New Zealand-based company will reduce prices
for its Anmum-branded products by 9 percent in China next month,
it said in an e-mailed press statement.  The move is meant to ensure Fonterra’s products remain
competitive after several rivals announced price reductions,
Maree Wilson, a spokesperson at Fonterra, said in a separate e-mail response to questions.  Abbott Laboratories (ABT) ,  Nestle SA (NESN) ,  Danone SA (BN) , Royal
FrieslandCampina NV and Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. lowered
prices after the National Development and Reform Commission, the
country’s top economic planning agency, began an investigation
into their pricing of milk powder.  The NDRC has proof the companies sold products at high
prices in China and their pricing increased about 30 percent
since 2008, the same year melamine-tainted baby formula killed
six infants, the official People’s Daily has reported.  Fonterra on July 4 said it had been contacted by NDRC
regarding a current broad-ranging investigation of consumer
dairy products in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
