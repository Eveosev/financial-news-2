Euro-area  consumer prices  increased
1.6 percent in June, as energy rebounded from two months of
declines.  Annual consumer-price growth quickened to 1.6 percent from
1.4 percent in May, in line with an initial estimate on July 1,
the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
In the month, prices rose 0.1 percent, while the annual core
inflation rate, excluding volatile costs such as energy, alcohol
and tobacco, was 1.2 percent.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  earlier this
month took what he called an “unprecedented” step and told
investors that  interest rates  in the 17-nation euro area would
stay low as the economy struggles to emerge from recession,
lending is weak and inflation pressures remain subdued. The
ECB’s  benchmark rate  is at a record low 0.5 percent.  The euro-area economy, which has contracted for  six
straight quarters , probably stagnated in the three months
through June and will return to growth in the third quarter,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The ECB sees
consumer prices rising 1.4 percent this year.  Energy costs increased 1.6 percent compared with a drop of
0.2 percent in May, according to today’s release. The cost of
food, alcohol and tobacco rose 3.2 percent, the same rate as in
May, while the cost of services increased 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
