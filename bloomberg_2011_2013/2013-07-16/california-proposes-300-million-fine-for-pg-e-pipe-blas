California Public Utilities
Commission staff recommended  PG&E Corp. (PCG)  pay a minimum $300
million fine as part of a proposed $2.25 billion penalty for the
2010 natural gas pipeline explosion that killed eight people in
San Bruno.  The fine would be the largest ever ordered by the
California regulator, the commission’s Consumer Protection and
Safety Division said in a filing today. “The tragedy in San
Bruno, which was directly caused by PG&E’s unreasonable conduct
and neglect for decades, was the worst disaster in the history
of California electric and/or gas utilities.”  The proposal, subject to review by administrative law
judges and a vote by the full commission, amends a prior staff
recommendation under which the company would’ve been forced to
spend the entire $2.25 billion to improve its pipeline system.
The new plan would require the San Francisco-based utility owner
to pay $300 million into the state’s general fund.  San Bruno has previously called for the state regulator to
impose a $3.85 billion penalty. The original proposal “let PG&E
off the hook” by allowing the company to claim credit for prior
pipeline work, the city said on July 2. PG&E Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Anthony Earley called the original $2.25
billion penalty proposal “excessive” on May 6.  ‘Unorthodox Events’  PG&E didn’t immediately respond to e-mails and a phone
message seeking comment on the revised staff recommendation.  The commission said some of the attorneys working on the
case asked to be reassigned last month after the division
initially proposed the $2.25 billion penalty. In  asking  to amend
its original proposal, the division cited the “unorthodox
events” surrounding staffing changes.  The blast in San Bruno has cost PG&E’s shareholders $1.4
billion in mandated safety work and other expenses, the company
said on May 2. It precipitated the retirement of former PG&E
Chairman and CEO Peter Darbee and forced the state’s largest
utility owner to freeze its dividend. PG&E has set aside at
least $200 million for fines, according to a May 2 regulatory
filing.  Administrative law judges at the commission still must rule
on the recommended penalties. The five-member commission will
then vote on the final penalty amount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
