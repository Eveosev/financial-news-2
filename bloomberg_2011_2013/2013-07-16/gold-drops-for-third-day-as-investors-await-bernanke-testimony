Gold futures gained for the sixth
time in seven sessions as the dollar’s drop increased demand for
the metal as alternative investment on speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will maintain its monetary stimulus.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, fell as much as 0.6 percent. Gold
jumped 5.4 percent last week as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said that “highly accommodative monetary policy for the
foreseeable future is what’s needed.” He is scheduled to
testify tomorrow before a congressional committee.  “The weakness in the dollar is keeping gold well
supported,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J.
O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“People expect Bernanke to repeat what he said last week.”  Gold futures for August delivery gained 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,290.40 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . On July 11, the price reached $1,297.20, the highest for a
most-active contract since June 24.  Futures have plunged 23 percent this year, erasing $59.3
billion from the value of  exchange-traded products  backed by the
metal. Some investors lost faith in gold amid an equity rally
and muted inflation. The commodity’s drop to a 34-month low on
June 28 spurred more demand for coins, bars and jewelry.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$19.935 an ounce on the Comex. Trading was 53 percent below the
average in the past 100 days, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Palladium futures for September delivery advanced 0.5
percent to $735.60 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The price climbed for the seventh straight session, the longest
rally since September. The metal reached $737.25, the highest
since June 13.  Platinum futures for October delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1,425.10 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $1,434.90, the
highest since June 19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
