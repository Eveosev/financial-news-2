Billionaire Jack Ma, Chairman of
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., has been called to apologize for
comments he made related to the Tiananmen Square crackdown.  Activists have started an online petition and are asking Ma
to rescind comments made in a South  China  Morning Post  interview 
published July 13. Ma suggested former Chinese leader  Deng
Xiaoping  acted appropriately during the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen
crackdown in which hundreds of people were killed when the army
cleared protesters who had occupied the square in the center of
Beijing, according to the newspaper.  Deng Xiaoping, then China’s top leader, had to make
“cruel” decisions during the June 4 crackdown for the
country’s stability, Ma said, according to the Post. Ma likened
his own decisions at Alibaba to choices made by Deng.  Alibaba spokesman John Spelich didn’t immediately respond
to three e-mails and a phone call asking about the petition.  Alibaba is expected by market analysts to issue an initial
public offering as big as $100 billion as early as this year.
The boycott may create a hiccup for Alibaba’s possible IPO and
it’s unlikely to damage its business, said Mark Tanner, founder
of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based research and marketing agency.  “Alibaba is so deeply entrenched I can’t imagine a huge
amount of people to just stop using it,” said Tanner by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
