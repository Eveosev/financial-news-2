Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS) , Colombia’s
largest cement maker, rallied to a three-month high as Deutsche
Bank AG said the company may exceed the bank’s forecast for a 38
percent increase in a measure of profit.  The  common shares  rose 1.2 percent to 8,730 pesos at 2:08
p.m. in Bogota after earlier gaining 2.7 percent to the highest
intraday level since April 5. The Colcap index increased 1.1
percent. Medellin-based Cemargos’s shares pared their drop this
year to 14 percent.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization in the company’s second quarter may increase to 256
billion pesos from 185 billion pesos in the same period a year
earlier, according to Deutsche Bank analysts Esteban Polidura
and Daniela Najar. There’s “upside potential” to the second-quarter estimate, they said in an e-mailed research report.  “An advantageous calendar effect along with solid
infrastructure activity in  Colombia ,  Panama  and the Caribbean
should back strong volume growth in the region,” they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
