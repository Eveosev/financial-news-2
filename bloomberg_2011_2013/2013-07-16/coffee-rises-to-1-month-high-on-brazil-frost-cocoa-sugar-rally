Arabica-coffee futures rallied to a
one-month high on signs that rain and frost may delay harvesting
in  Brazil , the world’s largest grower and exporter. Cocoa, sugar
and orange juice also advanced. Cotton was little changed.  A cold front will bring as much as 5 inches (13
centimeters) of rain starting July 18 in Sao Paulo and Parana
states, with temperatures dropping below freezing July 23
through July 25, said Kyle Tapley, a meteorologist for the
Gaithersburg, Maryland-based forecaster MDA Information Systems.
Damage to Brazil’s coffee trees would help reduce a global
surplus that helped send prices tumbling 14 percent this year
through yesterday.  “It’s going to be colder and wetter in Brazil this
weekend,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures
Group Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “That
will delay harvest at minimum, but it could even freeze.”  Arabica coffee for September delivery advanced 0.8 percent
to $1.2425 a pound at 10:35 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S, after
touching $1.2675, the highest for a most-active contract since
June 12. Yesterday, prices rallied 3.2 percent, the most since
May 2.  Cocoa futures for September delivery increased 2.9 percent
to $2,286 a metric ton in  New York , the highest for a most-active contract since June 14.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery rose 0.2 percent to
16.19 cents a pound on ICE. This year, the commodity dropped 17
percent through yesterday.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 1.4
percent to $1.4145 a pound, the third straight advance. Earlier,
the price reached $1.418, the highest since June 24.  Cotton futures for December delivery was unchanged at 85.1
cents a pound on ICE. The price has climbed 13 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
