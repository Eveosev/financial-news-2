Henderson Global Investors Ltd., the
manager of $104 billion in assets, won local-government approval
to develop part of Smithfield Market in the City of London
financial district into offices, shops and restaurants.  The 160 million-pound ($240-million)  project  will include
16,260 square meters (175,000 square feet) of offices and 5,570
square meters of shops, London-based Henderson said in a
statement published on its website in May. The market is a third
of a mile from the site on which Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
affiliates will develop an office building and adjacent to
Farringdon Station.  Henderson is seeking to profit from the construction of the
Crossrail high-speed subway line connecting London’s east and
west. Farringdon will become one of Britain’s busiest train
stations when the rail line opens, according to  Crossrail .  Most of the site’s Victorian buildings and all of the
former fish market will be retained, according to the statement.  Henderson is one of Europe’s largest investment managers
with about 69 billion pounds of assets under management as of
March 31, according to the company’s website.  -- With assistance from Neil Callanan in  London . Editors: Jeff
