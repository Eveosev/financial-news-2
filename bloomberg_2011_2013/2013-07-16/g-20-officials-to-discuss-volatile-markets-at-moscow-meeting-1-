Policy makers from Group of 20
nations meeting later this week in Moscow will discuss recent
volatility in financial markets, according to a Canadian finance
department official.  Volatility in currency and bond markets has been the main
development since G-20 finance ministers and central bankers met
in April, said the official, who spoke on condition they not be
identified. Speculation the Federal Reserve may consider
tapering its unprecedented bond-purchase program has been an
element of the volatility, the official said.  Global yields surged and equities fell after Federal
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled on June 19 the U.S. central
bank may start tapering its monthly stimulus program this year.
U.S. 10-year yields, which climbed 36 basis points in June, have
pared increases this week as that concern has eased.  Bernanke said on July 10 in a question-answer session after
a speech in Cambridge,  Massachusetts  that inflation and
unemployment rates show the U.S. economy still requires very
accommodative monetary stimulus.  Market volatility prompted International Monetary Fund
Managing Director Christine Lagarde to say today that central
banks need to find a “subtle” approach to phase out stimulus
measures.  Finance chiefs from the 20 largest developed and emerging
economies meet in Moscow July 19-20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
