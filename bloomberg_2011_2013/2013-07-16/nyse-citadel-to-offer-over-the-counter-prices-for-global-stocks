NYSE Euronext (NYX)  said it reached an
agreement with Citadel LLC’s market-making unit to distribute
real-time price quotes for about 6,500 international over-the-counter equities.  The so-called Greysheet comprises stocks from 34 countries
that are actively traded by investors and not on an exchange.
The prices will be distributed by NYSE’s market data service
known as SuperFeed, according to a statement today from the
operator of the largest U.S. exchange.  “This feed offers an unparalleled solution for efficiently
extending OTC data to the global trading community when compared
to other alternatives that are particularly limited in data
sourcing and high-speed, global distribution capabilities,”
NYSE said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
