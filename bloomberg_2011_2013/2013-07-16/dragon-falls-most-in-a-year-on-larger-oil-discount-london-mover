Dragon Oil Plc (DGO) , an explorer focused
on  Turkmenistan , fell the most in more than a year in London
trading after saying it expects to sell oil at a bigger discount
to Brent.  The shares slid as much as 6.2 percent, the steepest
intraday decline since May 2012, and were 4.4 percent lower at
621.50 pence as of 10:55 a.m. Today’s drop pared its gain for
the year to 12 percent.  Dragon sold its oil for an average of $86 a barrel at about
20 percent discount to Brent in the first half, according to a
statement today. It sees the discount ranging from 16 percent to
21 percent to the European crude benchmark, up from a February
forecast of 14 percent to 17 percent, since the “pricing period
is not aligned with the reporting period.”  Dragon also said today the delivery of the platform-based
Land Rig 3 is being delayed “on the contractor’s side” and
drilling is now expected to start in the middle of 2014.  “Realizations and rig delays disappoint,” Tom Robinson, a
London-based analyst at Nomura International Plc, wrote in an e-mailed report. “Further delays to infrastructure and drilling
rigs highlight the logistical pressures of Caspian Sea
operations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
