Ultra-low-sulfur diesel jumped to a
three-month high as declining European gasoil supplies and
higher prices indicated more opportunities for U.S. exports.  ULSD advanced as gasoil rose a third straight day on the
 London  ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. Gasoil stockpiles in
independent storage at Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub fell 3.2 percent to 1.84 million metric tons in the
week ended July 11, the lowest level since December, according
to PJK International BV. ULSD crack spreads gained.  “The distillate complex is supported by stronger gasoil in
Europe due to run cuts and increased Saudi buying,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a
research company in London.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel, or ULSD, for August delivery rose
2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.0461 a gallon at 9:55 a.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 3.2 percent
above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
widened 69 cents to $21.47 a barrel. The  premium over Brent 
increased 74 cents to $18.75.  Gasoil for August delivery on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange rose $4.50 to $921 a metric ton.  August-delivery gasoline rose 0.61 cent to $3.109 a gallon
on volume that was 11 percent above the 100-day average.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI gained 5 cents to $24.05
a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent increased 6 cents to
$21.29.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 2.2 cents to $3.635
a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
It was the eighth consecutive increase and pushed prices to the
highest level since June 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
