Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) , the world’s
biggest shipper of thermal coal, will suspend production at its
magnetite iron ore operation in Australia because of lower
prices and high costs.  “Falling revenue, increasing production costs and on-going
high logistics costs in getting our product from mine to market
have eroded the margins in this business,” the Baar,
Switzerland-based  company  said today in an e-mailed statement.
“Global iron ore prices have experienced more than a 30 percent
drop over the past two years.”  The plant, which processed magnetite iron ore produced at
Glencore Xstrata’s Ernest Henry copper mine in Queensland state,
cost A$79 million ($72 million) to build, Xstrata Plc  said in
February 2011 . Since Glencore’s  takeover  of Xstrata, the company
has shed jobs in  Australia , cutting about 450 coal mining
positions in June.  The operation was slated to produce 1.2 million metric tons
annually, Xstrata said in 2011. Last year, the plant produced
almost 500,000 metric tons of iron in magnetite concentrate, the
company said today in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
