U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke should be required to testify in Maurice “Hank” Greenberg’s lawsuit over the bailout of  American International
Group Inc. (AIG) , Greenberg’s lawyers said.  Bernanke made key decisions about the government takeover
of the insurer during the financial crisis, according to a
filing by Greenberg’s Starr International Co. today in the U.S.
Court of Federal Claims in Washington.  Starr sued the U.S. for $25 billion in 2011. Greenberg
called the assumption of 80 percent of AIG’s stock by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York in September 2008 a taking of
property in violation of shareholders’ constitutional rights to
due process and equal protection of the law. Starr today urged
Judge Thomas Wheeler to deny a government request to quash a
deposition subpoena of Bernanke.  “No other witness can serve as a substitute for Mr.
Bernanke’s testimony,” according the filing. By Bernanke’s own
admission, “the decision to take over AIG was his.”  The case is Starr International Co. v. U.S., 11-cv-00779,
U.S. Court of Federal Claims ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
