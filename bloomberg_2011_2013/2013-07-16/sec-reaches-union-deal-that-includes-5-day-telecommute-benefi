The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has agreed on a new contract with its union that will
allow some employees to telecommute as many as five days a week
and expands child-care subsidies.  The agreement with the SEC’s chapter of the National
Treasury Employees Union also will permit new flexible work
schedules that allow employees to vary their hours and includes
new rules for furloughs caused by  federal budget  cuts. A
collective-bargaining agreement covers non-management employees,
according to the union’s website.  The deal was announced to SEC employees on July 12 in an e-mail from SEC Chairman Mary Jo White and union president Greg
Gilman, according to a copy of the message obtained today.  “We are very pleased to be in agreement on this important
employment contract at the SEC, and we hope to continue our
positive collaborative efforts to make the SEC the best place to
work in the federal government, or anywhere else,” White and
Gilman wrote.  SEC spokesman Judy Burns didn’t immediately respond to an
request for comment.  The e-mail says telecommuting will be available for three,
four, or five days a week and will be “phased in across the
agency.” Currently, 10 percent of the agency’s non-management
staff telecommutes two days a week, Gilman said in an e-mail
responding to questions about the agreement. “Only a small
handful of employees” work from home five days a week, Gilman
said. Most of them review corporate filings, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
