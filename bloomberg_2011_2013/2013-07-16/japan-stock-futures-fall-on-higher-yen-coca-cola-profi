eight-week high, after the yen rose,  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) ’s profit
dropped and a Federal Reserve official called for cuts to U.S.
stimulus. Australian equity futures declined.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a

today. The gauge dropped 0.4 percent in New York yesterday,
halting its longest rally since January, as Coca-Cola reported
profit fell 4 percent, the second quarterly decline in a row, as

shifting tastes in the U.S. and unseasonable weather in places
such as India.  Fed Bank of Kansas City President Esther George said
yesterday the U.S. was on the “right path” for economic

“appropriate.” Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will deliver his
