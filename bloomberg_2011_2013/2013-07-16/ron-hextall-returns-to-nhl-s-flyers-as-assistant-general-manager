Former Philadelphia Flyers
goaltender Ron Hextall, whose 240 wins are the most in team
history, has rejoined the organization as assistant general
manager and director of hockey operations.  Hextall, 49, spent the past seven National Hockey League
seasons as as assistant general manager for the  Los Angeles
Kings , who won a Stanley Cup title in 2012. He was also the
general manager for the Kings’ primary affiliate, the Manchester
Monarchs of the American Hockey League.  Hextall played 11 seasons with the Flyers, compiling a
240-172-58 record with a 2.91 goals-against-average before
retiring in 1999. He also played one season with the Quebec
Nordiques and one with the  New York Islanders . After his
retirement, Hextall worked as a scout for the Flyers before
spending four seasons as the team’s director of pro personnel.  “We are very pleased to welcome back Ron Hextall to our
management team,” Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren said in
a statement. “Ron has a wealth of experience in the front
office in various capacities which will be a valuable addition
to our staff.”  Hextall won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL’s top goalie after
his rookie season in 1986-87, when he led the league with 37
wins. He also received the Conn Smythe Trophy as the postseason
Most Valuable Player even though the Flyers lost to the Edmonton
Oilers in seven games in the Stanley Cup finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
