Kenya ’s government plans to hold
talks with  Ethiopia  about the impact the construction of the
Gibe III hydropower dam in southern Ethiopia may have on Lake
Turkana, Business Daily reported.  Kenya wants assurances that water collected by the dam,
which is being built on the Omo River, will be released and not
used to irrigate land, the Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing
Culture Secretary Hassan Wario.  Environmental activists have said the dam may reduce the
lake’s water level by as much as 33 feet (10 meters), depleting
fish stocks and compromising its status as a world heritage
site, the newspaper said.  Lake Turkana is the world’s largest desert lake and the
fourth-biggest fresh-water body in Africa. The lake provides a
livelihood for more than 20,000 people and supports more than 48
fish species, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
