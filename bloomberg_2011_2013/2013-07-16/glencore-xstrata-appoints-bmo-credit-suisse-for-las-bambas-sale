Glencore Xstrata Plc appointed BMO
Capital Markets Ltd. and Credit Suisse Securities ( Europe ) Ltd.
as financial advisers for the sale of its interest in the Las
Bambas copper-mine project in  Peru .  Glencore Xstrata has already received “numerous”
expressions of interest in the project, the Baar, Switzerland-based company said today in a statement.  The company needs to sell the copper project to appease
Chinese regulators who demanded the divestment to grant approval
for Glencore’s merger with Xstrata.  To contact the reporter on this story:
