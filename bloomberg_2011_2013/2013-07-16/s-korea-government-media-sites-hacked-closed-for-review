South Korea  suspects  North Korea  of
hacking attacks on government websites and media outlets last
month on the 63rd anniversary of the start of the  Korean War ,
South Korea’s Science Ministry said.  An analysis of malware codes, Internet addresses and
records of previous hacking attempts indicate that North Korea
was responsible, Park Jae Moon, director-general of the Science
Ministry’s IT Strategy Bureau, said at a briefing broadcast on
the government’s website today.  The attacks came after South Korea experienced its  biggest
cyber-attack in two years on banks and TV stations in March,
which the government also blamed on the North, a claim North
Korea denied. The two Koreas will hold a fourth round of
negotiations tomorrow on restarting operations at their jointly
run Gaeseong industrial park.  South Korea raised its national cyber-attack alert to level
3 from 5 after the websites of President Park Geun Hye, Prime
Minister Chung Hong Won and 11 media outlets were attacked on
June 25. A level 3 alert is for recurring damage and when sites
are down for several hours.  “The cyber attack seriously undermined the country’s image
by altering websites of symbolic government organizations,” the
ministry said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
