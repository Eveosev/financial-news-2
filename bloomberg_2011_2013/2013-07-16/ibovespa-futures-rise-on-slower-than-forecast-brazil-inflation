The Ibovespa rose for a second day
as homebuilder  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA (MRVE3)  climbed to a
two-week high after reporting a quarterly sales increase and as
data showed slower-than-forecast inflation in  Brazil .  Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes (CYRE3) 
also gained as booked sales recovered.  Usinas Siderurgicas de
Minas Gerais SA  paced losses among steelmakers, while oil
producer OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA led a drop in
companies controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista . Iron ore
producer Vale SA increased to a three-week high, contributing
most to the gauge’s advance.  The Ibovespa gained 0.3 percent to 46,869.29 at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo after earlier falling as much as 0.7
percent. Thirty-nine stocks declined on the gauge and 29 rose,
while 100-day  volatility  on the measure reached 22.83, the
highest since November. The real weakened 1.5 percent to 2.2541
per dollar at 5:28 p.m. local time.  “Cyrela and MRV are two of the most attractive companies
in the homebuilding sector,” Felipe Miranda, an analyst at
Empiricus Research, a Sao Paulo-based equity consulting firm,
said in a telephone interview. “They reported solid preliminary
figures, which are pushing stocks higher.”  MRV jumped 3.7 percent to 6.74 reais. Booked sales
increased 47 percent in the April-to-June period from a year
earlier, the company said in a regulatory filing yesterday after
the market closed.  Cyrela advanced 2.8 percent to 16.50 reais as quarterly
contracted sales increased 66 percent.  Limited Gains  Homebuilders also climbed as a report showing slowed
inflation reduced prospects for steeper increases in  interest
rates . The IGP-10  price index , which monitors wholesale,
construction and consumer prices, rose 0.43 percent in the month
ended July 10 following a prior increase of 0.63 percent, the
Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today. That compares with the
median estimate of 0.56 percent among economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Gains on the benchmark gauge were limited as Usiminas, as
Usinas Siderurgicas is also known, tumbled 3.6 percent to 7.28
reais. The shares had jumped 15 percent yesterday. Cia
Siderurgica Nacional SA, the steelmaker also known as CSN,
declined 3.1 percent to 5.88 reais after rallying 8.2 percent
yesterday.  “Despite the massive equity selloff in the last few
months, we remain cautious on the steel sector,” Banco BTG
Pactual SA analysts including Edmo Chagas wrote in a report
published today. “Global steel prices are likely to remain
under pressure on a combination of excess capacity and declining
raw material prices.”  Vale, OGX  Vale, the stock with the heaviest weight on the  Ibovespa (IBOV) ,
gained 1.9 percent to 27.87 reais, the highest since June 21.
The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index climbed
0.9 percent.  OGX slumped 3.9 percent to 49 centavos. Batista’s miner,
MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, dropped 2.2 percent to 1.34 reais,
extending its  decline  this year to 70 percent.  The Ibovespa had  slumped  23 percent this year through
yesterday, wiping out $248 billion from the  value  of Brazilian
equities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil’s main
equity gauge trades at 11.9 times analysts’  earnings estimates 
for the next four quarters, compared with 10.3 for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 5.1 billion
reais today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.81 billion reais this year
through July 12, according to data  compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
