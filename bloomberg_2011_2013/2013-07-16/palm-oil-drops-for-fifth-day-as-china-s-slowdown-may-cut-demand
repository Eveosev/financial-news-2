Palm oil  dropped for a fifth day to
trade near the lowest level in more than two months on
speculation that demand from China, the world’s biggest buyer
after India, may weaken as an economic slowdown deepens.  The contract for September delivery, with the most open
interest, retreated as much as 0.7 percent to 2,258 ringgit
($710) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, and was
at 2,263 ringgit at 12:08 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures touched
2,234 ringgit yesterday, the lowest level for the most-active
futures since May 6. Palm for local physical delivery in August
was at 2,310 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Expansion in China’s gross domestic product decelerated to
7.5 percent last quarter from 7.7 percent in the three months
through March 31. Growth in developing economies in Asia will be
weaker than initially estimated this year and next amid a slower
expansion in  China (CNGDPYOY)  and lackluster export demand from advanced
nations, the  Asian Development Bank  said today.  “This news is weighing on prices because China is
obviously a big market,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst with
Alliance Investment Bank Bhd. “China takes up about 20 percent
of Malaysia’s total exports, so its actually very significant.”  Shipments from Malaysia, the largest producer after
Indonesia, fell 23 percent to 547,857 tons in the first 15 days
of July from the same period in June, surveyor Intertek said
yesterday. Exports dropped 24 percent, with shipments to China
declining 37 percent in the first half of this month, according
to SGS (Malaysia) Sdn.  Refined palm oil for January delivery was little changed at
5,646  yuan  ($920) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , after
closing at the lowest price for the most-active contract since
July 2009 yesterday, while  soybean oil  for delivery in the same
month was also little changed at 7,180 yuan.  Soybean oil for delivery in December was little changed at
45.31 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while
soybeans for delivery in November gained 0.3 percent to $12.6775
a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
