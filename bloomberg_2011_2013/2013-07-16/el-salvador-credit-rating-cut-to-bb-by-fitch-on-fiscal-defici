El Salvador ’s credit rating was
lowered one level by  Fitch Ratings , citing a debt ratio that is
higher than that for peers.  Fitch cut El Salvador’s long-term foreign and local
currency sovereign credit ratings to BB-, three steps below
investment grade, from BB. The outlook is still negative. The
new ranking matches Serbia, Nigeria and  Bolivia .  “Government indebtedness has continuously deteriorated due
to large primary deficits and pension cost,” Santiago Mosquera,
New York-based Fitch analyst, said in a statement. “The
reliance on short-term debt is expected to increase given the
government’s growing difficulty to obtain legislative
authorization to issue long-term debt, thereby increasing roll-over risks.”  El Salvador’s debt as a percentage of gross domestic
product reached 56.7 percent in 2012, compared with 39 percent
for the BB median, according to Fitch.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold El Salvador’s
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 404
basis points, or 4.04 percentage points, at 11:13 a.m.  New York 
time. The gap reached 436 points on June 28, a 10-month high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
