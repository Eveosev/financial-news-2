Rockwell Collins  Inc. said it isn’t
involved in an investigation into a fire last week on a  Boeing
Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliner jet that was parked at London’s Heathrow
airport.  The company, which supplies the 787’s avionics systems,
cockpit displays and common data network, “has not been
contacted” by U.K. regulators spearheading the probe, Joshua
Baynes, a Rockwell Collins spokesman, said in an e-mail.  An emergency beacon made by avionics supplier  Honeywell
International Inc. (HON)  is among the 787 components that is being
scrutinized as the U.K. Air Accidents Investigation Branch
determines what triggered the July 12 blaze.  To contact the reporter on this story:
