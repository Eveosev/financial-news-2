Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , acquirer of more than 25 daily newspapers in the last two
years, is eliminating about 50 jobs at the Tulsa World in
Oklahoma after making cuts at other publications.  A dozen positions in the administrative, information
technology and production departments were cut immediately,
according to a  report  posted today on the newspaper’s website.
The World announced other changes including the creation of
distribution centers where carriers will pick up newspapers,
eliminating transportation costs for the company.  “We felt like it was the right thing to do to let these
people know now,” Bill Masterson, Tulsa World’s publisher, said
today in a phone interview.  Buffett, 82, has been acquiring newspapers in a bet that
they will withstand  dwindling  advertising dollars and
circulation. Berkshire announced the closing of the Manassas
News & Messenger last year after the Virginia paper failed to
sustain profits. The Greensboro News & Record in  North Carolina ,
acquired by Buffett in January, announced this month the
 elimination  of 14 full-time positions.  About 10 of the 50 departing Tulsa employees will take jobs
at Berkshire Hathaway Media Group, the subsidiary that oversees
Buffett’s newspapers, Masterson said. He said that no editors or
reporters will be fired.  “These changes are an important part of our long-term
strategy and will help to strengthen our newspaper for decades
to come,” Masterson said in a July 15 memo to employees,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
