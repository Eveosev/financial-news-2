Orange-juice  futures are poised to
rally as much as 42 percent in New York to the highest since
February 2012, after topping a key resistance line, a technical
analysis by Hackett Financial Advisors Inc. shows.  Prices on ICE Futures U.S. yesterday rose above the 100-day
moving average of $1.4039 a pound for the first time since June
25, signaling a rally to $2 by September, said  Shawn Hackett ,
the president of the  Boynton Beach , Florida-based company.
Orange juice has rallied 13 percent from a three-month low on
June 26 as the government cut its crop estimate for Florida, the
world’s second-largest citrus grower.  “Given the incredibly bullish fundamental framework for
orange juice, I expect a major technical breakout to the upside
by summer’s end,” Hackett said in an e-mail yesterday.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 1.1
percent to $1.41 at 10:04 a.m. on ICE. A rally to $1.50 would
lead to “a retest of the double top” near $2, which represents
the peaks of $2.094 in December 2006 and $2.2695 in January
2012, according to Hackett, who also tracks the 200-month, 100-month and 50-month moving averages. Prices last reached $2 on
Feb. 7, 2012.  Florida  will produce 133.4 million boxes of oranges in the
year that ends Sept. 31, down from 146.7 million a year earlier,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on July 11. The USDA cut
its forecast four times since a February estimate of 141
million, citing damage from citrus greening, a bacterial
disease. A box of oranges weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.
Brazil is the world’s largest grower.  Hedge funds  and other speculators increased their net-long
position, or bets on price gains, by 8.4 percent in the week
ended July 9, the first increase in a month and up from the
most-bearish holdings since March, government data show.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
