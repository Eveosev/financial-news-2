Rijeka,  Croatia ’s biggest port and
third-largest city, won European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development funding to improve water supplies and expand the
wastewater collection network.  The 13 million-euro ($17 million) loan will go to ViK
Rijeka, the water and wastewater company majority owned by the
city of Rijeka, an administrative, transport and industrial
center with 190,000 residents, the EBRD said in a statement.  The  development bank  is also providing 27.2 million euros
in loans to provide safe water and improved sanitation for about
a half-million people in the Romanian counties of Bacau and
Maramures, it said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
