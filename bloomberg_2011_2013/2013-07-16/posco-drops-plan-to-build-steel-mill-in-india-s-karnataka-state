Posco,  Asia ’s third-biggest
steelmaker by output, scrapped a plan to build a mill in the
southern Indian state of Karnataka because of delays in getting
mining rights and purchasing land.  The South Korean steelmaker agreed with the Indian state to
pull out of the project, the Pohang-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. Both parties signed an initial
agreement for the 323 billion rupee ($5.44 billion) integrated
mill project in June 2010.  The decision came at a time when steelmakers globally are
suffering from falling profitability amid the economic slowdown.
Posco,  South Korea ’s biggest steelmaker, in April reported a
worse-than-estimated profit for the first quarter as slow demand
depressed prices. Second-quarter  earnings  are due July 25.  Separately, the Korean company’s proposed $12 billion
project in the eastern state of Odisha has also been delayed by
eight years because farmers had refused to vacate government-owned land they occupied for generations.  Posco (005490)  is waiting to
hear from the state government, which has said it has completed
land acquisition for the mill, I.G. Lee, spokesman at Posco’s
India unit, said in phone interview from  New Delhi  today.  Posco fell 1 percent to 310,000 won in Seoul trading at
2:29 p.m. local time, compared with a 0.6 percent drop in the
local benchmark  Kospi index . The stock has lost 11 percent this
year, underperforming a 6.7 percent decline in the Kospi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
