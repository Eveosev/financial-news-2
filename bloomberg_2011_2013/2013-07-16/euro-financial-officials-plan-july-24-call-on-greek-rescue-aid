Senior euro-area financial officials
plan a conference call on July 24 to discuss the latest bailout
aid payment for  Greece , a European Union official said on
condition of anonymity.  Euro-area governments agreed earlier this month to release
3 billion euros ($3.9 billion) of aid for Greece, seeking to buy
enough financial calm to prevent another debt-crisis showdown
until after  Germany ’s election in September.  Greece is scheduled to receive 2.5 billion euros of the
payment this month and the remaining 500 million euros in
October, as long as Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s tottering
coalition delivers on economic reforms and cuts to spending.  Euro-area finance ministers mandated the  Eurogroup Working
Group  to sign off on the payout. The initial 2.5 billion-euro
installment will be approved by the EWG, which prepares
ministers’ meetings, and the board of the  European Financial
Stability Facility  “following the full implementation of the
prior actions and once member states have finalized their
relevant national procedures,” the Eurogroup said in a July 8
 statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
