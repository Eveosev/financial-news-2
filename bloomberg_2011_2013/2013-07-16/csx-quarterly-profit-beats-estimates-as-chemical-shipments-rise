CSX Corp. (CSX) , the biggest railroad in
the eastern U.S., reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates as shipments of coal to domestic utilities
climbed for the first time since 2010.  Net income rose 4.5 percent to $535 million, or 52 cents a
share, from $512 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier,
Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX said today in a statement. That
beat the 47-cent average of 28  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  CSX benefited as coal, its biggest cargo, regained favor as
a fuel at U.S. power plants amid a climb in the price of natural
gas. The company had beaten or matched profit  expectations  in 15
of the previous 17 quarters, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, as the economy strengthened and Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Ward  boosted efficiency.  “Their increase in shipments of domestic utility coal
might be the light at the end of tunnel for investors looking
for this market to turn around,”  Lee Klaskow , a Bloomberg
Industries logistics analyst based in Skillman,  New Jersey , said
in an e-mail.  CSX said U.S. shipments of coal to utilities by tonnage
increased 9 percent, the first quarterly gain since the final
three months of 2010. Total coal volume fell 6.3 percent,
narrowing from a 10 percent drop in the first quarter. Shipments
of coal destined for export, primarily to  Europe , declined.  Revenue Climbs  Sales rose 1.9 percent to $3.07 billion, exceeding the
$3.03 billion average estimate. Total shipments rose 1 percent,
including gains of 11 percent for chemicals such as crude oil,
8.9 percent for phosphates and fertilizers as a customer mine
reopened and 7.1 percent for minerals such as stone and gravel
as construction recovered, CSX said.  “The company has been outperforming our traffic growth
assumptions,” a sign that second-quarter results would be
solid,  Jason Seidl , an analyst at Cowen & Co. in New York who
rates CSX shares market perform, wrote in a note to clients
before the announcement.  Operating ratio, an industry gauge of expenses to revenue,
fell to 68.6 percent from 70.4 percent in the first quarter and
68.7 percent a year earlier. CSX in April pushed back a goal of
lowering its ratio to 65 percent by 2015, in favor of a “high
60s” target with additional reductions later.  Profit per share this year will be “roughly flat” versus
2012, CSX said today. The company’s earlier forecast was for
those earnings to be little changed to “slightly down.”  CSX rose 2.2 percent to $25.17 in extended trading at
6:10 p.m. in  New York . Earlier, the  shares  closed at $24.64, an
increase of 1.2 percent. They have gained 25 percent this year,
as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
