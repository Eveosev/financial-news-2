BP Plc (BP/) , Europe’s second-largest oil
company, signed a deal for a third block in the South China Sea
with  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , the country’s biggest offshore explorer.  BP agreed to explore the 54/11 block in the Pearl River
Mouth Basin with Cnooc as operator. The license, covers 4,586
square kilometers (1,770 square miles) in water depths from 370
meters (1,200 feet) to 2,300 meters, and is close to two other
deepwater blocks where BP operates, the London-based company
said today in a statement.  “This is a good addition of acreage to our deepwater
portfolio in the South China Sea and deepens our close
relationship with Cnooc,” said Mike Daly, BP’s executive vice
president for exploration. “We look forward to some early
results.”  The deal bolsters BP’s presence in  China  as demand for
energy increases in the world’s second-largest economy. BP has
invested about $5 billion in the country in deepwater
exploration, chemicals, manufacturing and other businesses.  The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
