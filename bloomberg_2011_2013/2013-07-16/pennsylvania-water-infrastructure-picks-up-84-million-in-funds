Pennsylvania  will invest $84 million
in infrastructure projects including drinking-water distribution
lines, water storage tanks and curbing raw sewage discharges,
Governor Tom Corbett announced.  The works in nine countries include repairs to leaking
sewer mains in Harrisburg, the periodic discharge of untreated
sewage into the Kiskiminetas River and septic system
malfunctions that contaminate drinking-water wells, he said.  Financial assistance comes from state funds approved by
voters, federal grants to the Pennsylvania Infrastructure
Investment Authority from the Environmental Protection Agency,
and recycled loan repayments, according to todayâ€™s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
