Anglo (AAL)  American Plc’s Namdeb Diamond
Corp., a producer of gems in Namibia, said it’s raising output
at its Elizabeth Bay mine by 32 percent one year after resuming
operations and plans to extend mining there beyond 2015.  Elizabeth Bay, an open-cast operation 25 kilometers (16
miles south of the town of Luderitz that was shut for three
years, produced 205,000 carats last year “despite technical
challenges and a delayed ramp up,” Namdeb spokeswoman Pauline
Thomas said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Ongoing
improvements are bearing fruit and E-Bay is expected to produce
in excess of 270,000 carats during 2013.”  Namdeb, which is jointly owned by Anglo’s De Beers unit and
 Namibia ’s government, produced 1.67 million carats of gemstones
last year. Of this, 1.1 million carats were mined by the
Debmarine Namibia division in the southwest African country’s
Atlantic waters. These are home to an estimated 80 million
carats, the richest known marine diamond deposits in the world,
according to the company’s  website .  A 150 million Namibian-dollar ($15 million) recovery and
sorting facility, known as Red Area Complex, will be operational
by the end of the year.  “The complex will deliver more secure and efficient
processing of production,” Thomas said.  Construction of the Sendelingsdrif mine, which will cost
280 million Namibian dollars, is “progressing well” and output
is scheduled to start output in 2014.  “Sendelingsdrif is expected to replace production from the
Daberas mine, yielding 45,000 carats annually and extend the
life of the Orange River operations beyond 2020,” Thomas said.  Namdeb is looking to exploit diamonds in the “mid-water
and shallow water marine areas with the aim of mining these
beyond 2020,” she said.  “The technology required to mine these areas is still
being developed, but good progress is being made with both
resource and technology development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
