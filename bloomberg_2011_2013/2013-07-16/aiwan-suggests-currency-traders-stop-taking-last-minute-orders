Taiwan ’s central bank has
recommended that currency traders stop taking orders from
clients 10 minutes before the 4 p.m. market close in Taipei.  The request is to ensure banks have enough time to process
orders, and to strengthen their risk management, the monetary
authority said in a statement on its website today. The central
bank also reiterated that traders need to inform it about
transactions over $1 million, according to the statement.  The Central Bank of the Republic of  China  (Taiwan) has
started scaling back its last-minute intervention in the past
week, said traders who asked not to be identified. The monetary
authority has sold the local dollar in the run-up to the close
on most days in the past year to weaken the currency, they said.  The central bank called the island’s lenders yesterday and
asked them to stop taking client orders for Taiwan dollar buying
against the greenback after 3:30 p.m., according to three
traders who asked not to be identified. The monetary authority
declined to comment on the discrepancy between its statement and
the traders’ comments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
