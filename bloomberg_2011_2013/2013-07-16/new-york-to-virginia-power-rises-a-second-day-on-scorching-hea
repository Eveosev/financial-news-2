Spot wholesale electricity from New
England to  Virginia  gained a second day as unusually hot weather
lifted demand above forecasts.  The Northeast and mid-Atlantic states will see hot and
humid weather for much of the week, according to WSI Corp. in
Andover,  Massachusetts .  Consumers are using more electricity in New York and the
13-state PJM Interconnection LLC network from New Jersey into
North Carolina and  Illinois , data from the grid operators how.
Prices for the high-demand, on-peak, hours rose to a one-year
high on the PJM grid while New York increased to the highest in
six months.  “We suspect this will be the peak week for the summer,”
said Kate Trischitta, director of trading at Consolidated Edison
Inc.’s wholesale energy trading division in Valhalla, New York.
“Prices are strong and that reflects both the temperatures and
the high load conditions. We will continue to see these high
prices through Thursday.” Con Edison is the utility serving New
York City and Westchester County.  Spot power for New York City gained $11.35, or 13 percent,
to $96.89 a megawatt-hour for the hour ended at noon from the
same time yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The
 on-peak average  was down 65 percent at $75.91 from yesterday’s
full-day average of $217.56, the highest since Jan. 24.  PJM’s benchmark Western hub rose $4.98, or 4.3 percent, to
$121.74 a megawatt-hour. The  on-peak average  is down 38 percent
at $84.13 after surging to $135.36 yesterday, the most since
July 17, 2012.  Grid Demand  Demand on the New York state grid may peak at 33,300
megawatts today, topping the 2013 high of 32,703 megawatts
yesterday, the NYISO said in a statement today. PJM  expects 
power use on its grid to climb to 155,089 megawatts during the
hour ending at 5 p.m., 2.7 percent higher than yesterday’s
 hourly peak  of 151,058 megawatts.  The high temperature in New York City today will climb to
95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius), 11 above the normal high, up
from 94 yesterday, according to AccuWeather Inc. in State
College,  Pennsylvania .  Washington  will see a high of 96 degrees,
7 above the norm, and Boston will rise to 92, 10 higher.  PJM warned that system conditions may require maximum
generation supplies on the grid as operating reserves are
forecast to be less than the requirement, according to two
emergency alerts posted on its  website  late yesterday.  Power Cutbacks  The New York Independent System Operator Inc. activated
required and voluntary demand-curtailment programs for a second
day, from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. in New York City and other downstate
regions, according to an e-mailed statement. Businesses and
large consumers participating in the Special Case Resource
program will have to cut power usage by 774 megawatts during the
period.  Boston  power was up $48.21, or 55 percent, at $136.40 a
megawatt-hour for the hour ended at noon.  On-peak prices  were
down 52 percent at $66.89 from yesterday’s average of $139.42,
the most since Feb. 21.  “Rather than get caught short later, they bring the
generation on a little earlier than they need it because they
can’t ramp it as fast to meet the load,” Trischitta said.  ISO New England Inc. posted a Master/Local Control Center 2
 alert  for a second day based on existing or possible abnormal
conditions on the grid.  -- With assistance from Jim Polson in New York. Editors:
