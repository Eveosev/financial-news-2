Robusta coffee reached a seven-week
high in  London  as sliding exports from leading grower  Vietnam 
compounded rising local prices and low stockpiles in  Europe .
Cocoa advanced on speculation about crop delays.  Vietnam’s coffee shipments fell 37 percent on the year to
88,387 metric tons in June, according to customs  data . Local
bean prices were the highest since May 28 yesterday, data from
the Daklak Trade & Tourism Center on Bloomberg showed. Robusta
coffee stockpiles in depots monitored by NYSE Liffe slid 3.2
percent in the two weeks to July 8, according to exchange
figures.  Robusta gained “as the market attempts to play catch-up
with strong Vietnamese values,” Sterling Smith, a futures
specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a report e-mailed yesterday. “The September contract scored a strong
outside day with a positive close above recent resistance seen
at the $1,900-a-ton level,” he said, adding that futures buying
today was “key to maintaining the rally.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in September gained 1.2 percent
to $1,927 a ton by 10:32 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Prices
touched $1,928, the highest since May 28. Arabica coffee for the
same delivery month rose 1.1 percent to $1.2455 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York  after adding 3.2 percent yesterday.  Minas Gerais  Growing areas in  Brazil , the world’s top coffee producer
overall, will get rainfall from Parana state to southern  Minas
Gerais  from July 20 to July 24, potentially disrupting
harvesting, Sao Paulo-based weather forecaster Somar
Meteorologia said in a report e-mailed yesterday. A cold front
will bring showers to  Sao Paulo  and Parana starting July 18.  Cocoa for delivery in September gained 1 percent to 1,561
pounds ($2,353) a ton in London. The July contract, which
expires today, was at 1,531 pounds. Cocoa for delivery in
September advanced 1.3 percent to $2,249 a ton in New York.  Rain in some regions of West Africa, the world’s main
growing region, will probably help crop settings and survival
rates for the next harvest, according to London-based broker
Marex Spectron Group. Dry weather this year and a large mid-crop, the smaller of two annual harvests in  Ivory Coast , mean
the season will probably start later than usual.  “One aspect is relatively clear now to happen,” Eric Sivry, head of agriculture options brokerage at Marex Spectron,
said in a report e-mailed today. “We should see a delayed start
of the next harvest.”  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in October fell 0.4
percent to $461.80 a ton on NYSE Liffe. The August contract,
expiring today, was at $479.80. Raw sugar for delivery in
October slid 0.2 percent to 16.12 cents a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
