Rubber fell to a one-week low as
concerns grew that demand from  China , the largest consumer, may
weaken after data showed the nation’s economy slowed for a
second quarter.  Rubber for delivery in December on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 2.1 percent to 233.5 yen a kilogram
($2,335 a metric ton) and was at 234.6 yen at 9:57 a.m. after a
holiday yesterday. Futures extended last week’s 2.7 percent loss,
the first weekly drop since the five days through June 14.  Growth in developing economies in Asia will be weaker than
initially estimated this year and next amid a slower expansion
in China and lackluster export demand from advanced nations, the
Asian Development Bank said today. Expansion in China’s gross
domestic product decelerated to 7.5 percent last quarter from
7.7 percent in the three months through March 31.  “Concerns that demand from China and other  emerging
markets  will weaken sapped investor appetite for futures,” said
 Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  China may grow 7.7 percent this year and 7.5 percent in
2014, in part as a strengthening  yuan  weighs on external demand
and weaker domestic consumption curbs imports, the ADB said.
 Southeast Asia  will probably grow 5.2 percent this year from an
earlier prediction of 5.4 percent, according to the bank.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.4 percent to 17,410 yuan ($2,837) a ton.
Natural rubber inventories climbed by 109 tons to 114,230 tons,
the bourse said on July 12, based on a survey of nine warehouses
in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.  Thai rubber free-on-board fell 1.2 percent to 79.35 baht
($2.55) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
