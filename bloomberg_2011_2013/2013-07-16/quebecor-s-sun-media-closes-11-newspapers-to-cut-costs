Sun Media Corp., a unit of Canadian
publisher and broadcaster  Quebecor Inc. (QBR/B) , is closing 11
newspapers and cutting 360 jobs in a move the company expects
will save C$55 million ($53 million) a year.  The moves are needed to stay competitive as print revenue
continues to fall and more of the industry moves to digital,
Julie Tremblay, Sun Media’s chief operating officer, said in a
statement today.  “Digital is more than a strong trend,” said Tremblay.
“Young people are getting their information almost exclusively
from digital sources.”  Sun Media is closing its free urban daily 24 Hours
newspapers in Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton. 24 Hours competes
for readers with  Torstar Corp. (TS/B) ’s Metro, which has papers in
those three cities, according to Metro’s website.  The cuts come eight months after Sun Media eliminated 500
jobs and closed two production facilities in Ontario. Quebecor
fell 1 percent to $47.27 at 12:55 p.m. in Toronto.  Sun Media pulled the urban dailies so it could focus on one
paper in each urban market except for Montreal and Toronto,
where large commuter populations justify two papers, said Sun
Media.  In addition to the three 24 Hours papers, eight smaller
papers in  Quebec , Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan will close
or have already shuttered publication, the company said.  Sun Media says it’s the largest newspaper publisher in
 Canada , based on paid and free circulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
