A case of 2008 Chateau Lynch-Bages,
a wine estate in the Pauillac region of Bordeaux, sold for 745
pounds ($1,125) on the Liv-ex market, its highest level for more
than four months.  The transaction yesterday was 5 percent above the low for
this year at which it traded last month, and is more than double
the 340 pounds at which it sold in April 2009 when it started
trading in the futures market.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen more than 4 percent
this year, maintaining overall gains even as a 2 percent drop in
the second quarter of the year followed a 7 percent jump in the
first. While the index tracks top Bordeaux prices, investors and
collectors are also looking beyond the region’s flagship estates
to seek out other producers and regions.  The wine market is “much better than at the beginning of
the year,” said  Stephen Williams , founder of the London-based
 Antique Wine Company . “We’re not worried about prices going
down any more.”  The 2008 Lynch-Bages ranks as the estate’s third highest-priced wine of the past five years, lagging those from 2010 and
2009, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its
Cellar Watch website.  The vintage was awarded a 93 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , below the marks for the two vintages
that immediately followed it, according to the eRobertParker.com
 website .  Fifth Growth  Chateau Lynch-Bages has almost 100 hectares (247 acres)
planted with vines, predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon along with
Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyard is on the left bank of the Gironde estuary and
ranks as a fifth growth among the Bordeaux estates listed in the
Medoc classification drawn up for Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris
Exhibition. That puts it among the Medoc’s top 61 producers for
dry wines.  Its vineyards date back to at least to the 18th century and
the estate has been under the control of the Cazes family since
the Second World War.  To contact the reporter on this story:
