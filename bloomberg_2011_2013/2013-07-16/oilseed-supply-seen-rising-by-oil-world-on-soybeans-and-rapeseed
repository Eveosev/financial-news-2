Global supply of major oilseeds is
set to jump 18 percent this season from the previous period as
soybean and rapeseed harvests increase, Oil World said.  World inventories of seven oilseeds at the end of 2013-14
may be 86.5 million metric tons, compared with 73.3 million tons
a year earlier, the Hamburg-based researcher said today in an e-mailed report. Production may climb to a record 476.7 million
tons, helped by a 6.8 percent jump in soybean output to 284.2
million tons. Global production of rapeseed, the world’s second-largest oilseed crop after soybeans, may climb 1.4 percent to
63.5 million tons.  “Overall, prospects are for considerably more ample
oilseed supplies,” Oil World said. “The biggest improvement is
likely to occur in world production and supplies of soybeans.
Also, rapeseed output is set to rise to a new record.”  Soybeans slumped 30 percent since reaching a record on the
Chicago Board of Trade in September as drought cut crops in the
U.S., once the world’s top exporter. The national soybean
harvest may be 92 million tons, below the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s 93.08 million-ton forecast while still 12 percent
higher than a year earlier, Oil World said.  World processing, or crushing, of seven major oilseeds may
rise 2.9 percent from a year earlier to 393.3 million tons in
the 2013-14 season, led by soybeans, Oil World said.  The researcher cut its forecast for global sunflower-seed
output to 38.7 million tons, from 38.9 million tons projected
last month, because of declining prospects for the northern U.S.
and Bolivia, according to the report. Global production will
still be 7.9 percent larger than the past season.  World output of cottonseed may drop to 42.5 million tons,
the lowest in at least four years, Oil World said. Production of
groundnuts, also known as peanuts, may climb to 28 million tons,
the highest in at least four years, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
