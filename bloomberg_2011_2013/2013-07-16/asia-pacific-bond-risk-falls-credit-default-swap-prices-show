The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 2 basis points to
123 basis points as of 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The index is on course for its
lowest close since June 10, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 basis points to 141 as of 8:41
a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close since June
19, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1 basis point to 91
basis points as of 9:38 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index has ranged between 90.9 bps and 110.2 bps this
month, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
