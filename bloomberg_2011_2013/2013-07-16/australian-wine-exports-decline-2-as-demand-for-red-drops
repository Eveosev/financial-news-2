Australian wine exports fell 2
percent to A$1.82 billion ($1.67 billion) in the past year as a
decline in red wine exports outweighed an increase in whites,
according to the June  report  from Wine  Australia .  Bottled wine exports at higher price levels above A$7.50 a
liter rose, while cheaper wine shipments declined, Wine
Australia said. The United Kingdom was the leading export market
by volume, followed by the U.S.,  Canada , China and New Zealand,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
