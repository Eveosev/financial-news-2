Jupiter Fund Management Plc (JUP)  named
James Clunie manager of the Jupiter Absolute Return Fund to
succeed Philip Gibbs, who is retiring.  Clunie, 45, will take over the 482 million-pound ($728
million) fund on Sept. 1, the London-based asset manager said in
a statement today. Gibbs retires from fund management in October
2014, Jupiter said.  Jupiter, run by Edward Bonham Carter, specializes in
selling U.K. equity funds to individual investors and started
trading on the London Stock Exchange in June 2010. Clunie joined
Jupiter from U.K.-based Scottish Widows Investment Partnership,
where he ran the company’s U.K. Select Growth Fund and the U.K.
Opportunities Fund, the company said in April.  “Jupiter has an excellent reputation as a  fund management 
house,” Clunie said in the statement. “I am very much looking
forward to the challenge of delivering strong returns for
clients.”  Gibbs, who joined Jupiter in 1997, will remain as manager
of the Jupiter Split Investment Trust until the fund closes on
Oct. 31, 2014, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
