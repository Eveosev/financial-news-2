Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , the world’s
biggest maker of health-care products, more than doubled its
earnings in the second quarter after selling its stake in Elan
Corp. The company also boosted its profit forecast.  Earnings excluding one-time items for 2013 will be $5.40 to
$5.47 a share, the  New Brunswick , New Jersey-based company said
in a statement today. Second-quarter net income was $3.83
billion, or $1.33 a share. Profit of $1.48 a share beat by 9
cents the average of 20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  J&J sold its share of Elan in April and June for $1.26
billion, ending the relationship started with the Irish
biotechnology company to develop an Alzheimer’s drug. This was
the second consecutive time J&J benefited from a one-time gain,
after first-quarter results were helped by reversal of a payment
to the U.S. Medicaid insurance program for the poor.  “This quarter reinforces our belief that growth will
continue to accelerate,” said Judson Clark, an analyst with
Edward Jones & Co. in  Des Peres ,  Missouri . “The results were
distorted by the sale of biotech company Elan. As such, we are
not concerned by the lack of a larger guidance bump, and view
the guidance raise as a clear positive.”  Prior Forecast  In January, J&J had  forecast  profit of $5.35 to $5.45 a
share for 2013.  Second-quarter sales rose 8.5 percent to $17.9 billion,
helped by demand for the company’s newer pharmaceutical
offerings including the blood thinner Xarelto and the prostate
cancer medicine Zytiga. The company reported net income of $1.41
billion, or 51 cents, a year earlier, when results were hurt by
acquisition costs.  J&J shares closed unchanged at $90.40 in  New York   trading .
They have increased 32 percent in the 12 months.  The U.S. company had bought 18 percent of Elan for $1
billion in 2009.  Revenue from J&J’s pharmaceutical products grew 12 percent
to $7 billion, helped by a 9.8 percent increase in sales of the
rheumatoid arthritis treatment Remicade to $1.67 billion.  Sales
were also helped by the addition of newer products, including a
70 percent increase in sales of the prostate cancer treatment
Zytiga to $395 million and a more than three-fold increase in
sales of the anti-clotting drug Xarelto to $189 million.  Eight of the company’s therapies introduced since 2011
generated $4.4 billion last year, propelling J&J to the fastest
growth among large drugmakers.  Sales of  consumer goods  and over-the-counter medicines,
including Tylenol and Motrin, climbed 1.1 percent to $3.66
billion as the McNeil unit continues to return recalled products
to U.S. store shelves. The medical device and diagnostic unit,
the company’s biggest, saw sales rise 9.6 percent to $7.19
billion, helped by the acquisition of Synthes Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
