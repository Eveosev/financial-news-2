Industrial metals swung between
gains and losses as investors awaited the release of U.S.
consumer prices and industrial production data later today and
 Federal Reserve ’s next move on stimulus.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $6,925 a metric ton at 9:40 a.m.
in Shanghai after gaining as much as 0.6 percent. Aluminum, lead,
nickel and tin were little changed. Zinc fell 0.2 percent.  The U.S. is going to report June consumer price indexes and
industrial production later today. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  is scheduled to testify before a congressional
committee tomorrow, after saying last week that “highly
accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future is
what’s needed.”  “Copper is still seeking direction as market focus is on
the timetable of the U.S.’s exit of stimulus policies,” said
Xiong Dabiao, an analyst at Minmetals Futures Co. in Shanghai.
“People are also watching U.S. economic data, hoping to find
clues on what Bernanke plans to do.”  Copper for delivery in September on the Comex fell 0.2
percent to $3.1380 a pound. Metal for delivery in November on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange declined 0.2 percent to 49,790
 yuan  ($8,111) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
