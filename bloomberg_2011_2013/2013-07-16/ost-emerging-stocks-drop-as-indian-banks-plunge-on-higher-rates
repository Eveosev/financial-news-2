the rupee strengthened after India’s central bank raised two
interest rates to support the nation’s currency. Chinese
developers and coal producers slid, while solar companies rose.  The S&P BSE Bankex index, a gauge of 13 Indian lenders,
plunged 4.6 percent, heading for the biggest drop since July
2009. The nation’s bonds tumbled and the rupee climbed 0.7
percent versus the dollar.  China  National Building Material Co.
Ltd dropped 3 percent in Hong Kong on speculation the government
will expand property curbs. Coal producer  Shougang Fushan
Resources Group Ltd (639)  slumped 5.9 percent after saying profit
fell.  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  led solar stocks higher on a
Chinese plan to boost capacity.  Almost three stocks declined for every two that rose on
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, which added 0.2 percent to 954.21

estimated this year and next amid a slower expansion in China
and lackluster export demand from advanced nations, the Asian
Development Bank said.  The region’s gross domestic product will probably increase
6.3 percent in 2013 and 6.4 percent next year, the Manila-based

percent, while Yes Bank Ltd. plunged 8.5 percent. The S&P BSE

cut its year-end target for the index by 6.9 percent.  “Banks’ profitability will take a hit after this rate
hike,” Vishal Narnolia, a Mumbai-based banking analyst at SMC
Global Securities Ltd., said by phone. “The lenders will now
have to raise deposit rates or borrow funds from money markets
at higher rates. The higher cost of funds cannot be fully passed
on, as lending growth is already at a three-year low.”  The yield on the nation’s 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022
jumped 42 basis points to 8.1 percent, the most since January
2009.  The monetary authority also said it will conduct open-market sales of government debt totaling 120 billion rupees ($2
billion) on July 18, a step that would drain cash from an
economy expanding at the slowest pace in a decade.  The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index was little changed in
