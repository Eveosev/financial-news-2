Portugal ’s  economy  will grow less
than previously forecast in 2014 when the government plans to
implement new spending cuts, the country’s central bank said.  Gross domestic product will expand 0.3 percent in 2014
after declining 2 percent in 2013, the Lisbon-based Bank of
Portugal said today in its summer economic bulletin. In March,
the central bank forecast a contraction of 2.3 percent for 2013
and growth of 1.1 percent in 2014.  “In a context of high uncertainty, the risks associated
with the projection for economic activity are balanced for 2013
and on the downside for 2014,” the central bank said in a
statement.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness as he cuts spending and raises taxes to meet the
terms of a 78 billion-euro ($102 billion) aid plan from the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund . Coelho
announced measures on May 3 intended to generate savings of
about 4.8 billion euros through 2015 that include reducing the
number of state workers.  Government ministries will have to reduce spending on
purchases of goods and services by at least 10 percent next
year, Coelho said in May.  Export Growth  The central bank forecasts investment will drop 8.9 percent
in 2013 and rise 1.1 percent in 2014, while private consumption
will decline 3.4 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. It
projects inflation of 0.4 percent for this year and 0.8 percent
in 2014.  Export (PTTBEUAL)  growth will accelerate to 5.5 percent in 2014 from
4.7 percent in 2013. The  trade surplus  is forecast to widen to
4.9 percent of GDP in 2014 from 3 percent in 2013 and from 0.1
percent last year, which was the first surplus in the balance of
goods and services in at least 60 years, according to the Bank
of Portugal. It predicts a current and capital-account surplus
of 4.5 percent of GDP in 2013 and 6.4 percent in 2014.  Economic growth has averaged less than 1 percent a year for
the past  decade , placing Portugal among  Europe ’s weakest
performers. The government projects GDP will contract 2.3
percent this year before growing 0.6 percent next year while the
jobless rate will climb to 18.2 percent in 2013 and 18.5 percent
in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
