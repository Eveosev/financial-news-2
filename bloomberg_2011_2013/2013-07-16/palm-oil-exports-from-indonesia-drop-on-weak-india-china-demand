Palm oil  shipments from Indonesia,
the largest producer, unexpectedly declined last month to the
lowest level since April because of reduced purchases by  India 
and  China , the top buyers.  Exports of palm and kernel oils fell 11 percent to 1.62
million metric tons from 1.82 million tons in May, data from the
Indonesian Palm Oil Association showed today. That compared with
1.25 million tons shipped in June 2012, according to the data.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey published yesterday
was for a gain of 2.2 percent from May to 1.86 million tons.  Palm has lost 27 percent in  Kuala Lumpur  over the past year,
touching a two-month low yesterday, as supply of the commodity
used in everything from cooking oil to biofuel outpaced demand.
World stockpiles will jump 21 percent to a record 9.5 million
tons in 2013-2014, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.  “Fundamentally, global palm oil demand is still weak,”
the growers and refiners group known as Gapki said in a
statement today. Shipments declined because of a weak Indian
rupee and a slowdown in  China’s economy , it said.  Sales to India fell 31.5 percent to 404,520 tons in June
from a month earlier and to China dropped 9 percent to 170,570
tons, the group said.  The  Indian rupee  fell to a record 61.2125 per dollar on
July 8, making imports expensive for the biggest buyer of palm
oil. China’s economic  growth  slowed for a second quarter to 7.5
percent in April-to-June, according data yesterday from the
National Bureau of Statistics.  Price Decline  Palm oil for September delivery traded 0.2 percent lower at
2,268 ringgit ($711) on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives today.
Futures touched 2,234 ringgit yesterday, the lowest level for
the most-active contract since May.  First-half shipments from Indonesia rose 23 percent to 10.6
million tons, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
today’s data from Gapki.  Pakistan  bought 44,250 tons, up 157
percent from May, to meet demand for the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan that started this month and the Eid al-Fitr festival
that falls in August, the group said.  Reserves in  Indonesia  probably contracted 7.7 percent to a
one-year low of 2.4 million tons last month, the Bloomberg
survey showed. Gapki does not issue stockpile and output data.
Inventories in Malaysia, the second-biggest producer, fell 9.4
percent to 1.65 million tons in June, the lowest since March
2011, the country’s palm oil board said July 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
