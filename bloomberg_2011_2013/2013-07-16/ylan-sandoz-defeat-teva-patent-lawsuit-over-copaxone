Mylan Inc. (MYL)  and Sandoz AG won the
dismissal of lawsuits by  Teva (TEVA)  Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
that claimed the drug companies infringed its patents for a
medicine used to treat multiple sclerosis.  U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan,
granting the drug companies’ motions to dismiss the cases in
their entirety, said they’re using technology different from
what’s in Teva’s patents, according to a filing today.  “Any case or controversy that may have existed at the
outset of these cases when filed has been mooted,” Forrest said
in her opinion.  Sandoz, based in  Basel , Switzerland, and Canonsburg,
Pennsylvania-based Mylan were sued by Teva after they filed with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval of generic
drugs to compete with Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva’s
Copaxone, which is prescribed to reduce the frequency of
relapses in MS patients.  The cases are Teva Pharmaceuticals USA v. Sandoz, 09-10112,
and Teva Pharmaceuticals v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals, 10-7246, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
