Swire Properties Ltd. (1972) , the Hong Kong
builder investing more than $1 billion in a development in
Miami, said it is paying over $64 million to buy a nearby site
in the city to add to its Brickell CityCentre project.  The 1.55 acre site at 700 Brickell Avenue, bought through
Swire Propertiesâ€™s U.S. unit, is currently occupied by the
Florida headquarters of Northern Trust Bank, the Hong Kong-based
company said in a press release today. The sellers were Northern
Trust Co. and the co-trustees of the Marjorie O. Brickell
Revocable Trust, it said.  Swire Properties, which owns the Pacific Place and Island
East commercial complexes in Hong Kong, is expanding outside the
Asian city where the government has imposed extra transaction
taxes on retail and office properties in the past year to quell
concerns that an asset bubble is forming. The company also has
developments in four other Chinese cities.  The Miami site will be incorporated into the Brickell
CityCentre project, which will include a shopping mall, two
apartment buildings, offices and a hotel, Swire Properties said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
