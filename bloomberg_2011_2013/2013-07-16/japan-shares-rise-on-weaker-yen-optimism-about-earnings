Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index closing at its highest level in almost two months, on
optimism about earnings in  Japan  and the U.S. Profits at Topix
companies are projected to almost double this quarter.  Best Denki Co. (8175)  jumped 14 percent after the electronics
retailer’s net income surged. Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.
advanced 1.7 percent on a report the maker of Subaru cars may
post record quarterly operating profit. Nintendo Co. traded 5.6
percent higher in  Tokyo  after the gaming-console producer’s main
listing was transferred from  Osaka  as part of the merger between
Japan’s two largest bourses.  The Topix gained 0.7 percent to 1,210.54 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, with volume 17 percent below the 30-day
average. The gauge closed at its highest level since May 22. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose for a third day, adding 0.6
percent to 14,599.12.  “Earnings across the board are likely to be strong,” said
 Naoki Fujiwara , chief  fund manager  at Shinkin Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of $4.8 billion. “While the
market has priced in a lot of it, I don’t think it has factored
in the full potential for positive earnings yet because
investors are still in wait-and-see mode. But the overall trend
is for stocks to keep rising.”  After plunging as much as 18 percent from a May 22 high,
the Topix has rebounded amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will push through economic reforms following elections on July
21. The gauge added 14 percent in the past four weeks, the most
since April 2009.  Earnings Jump  Earnings at Topix companies will surge 92 percent to 22.38
yen per share, compared with 11.67 yen per share last quarter,
according to analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings
are projected to grow 56 percent for the year, the data show.
Quarterly profits on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index are
expected to rise 6 percent, according to Bloomberg data.  Best Denki, which gets 87 percent of its revenue from Japan
and the rest from  Asia , surged 14 percent to 208 yen, the
biggest advance in three months. The stock earlier rose by the
most since its listing in 1982. The retailer reported a 23-fold
increase in net profit to 542 million yen. Yamada Denki Co., its
controlling shareholder, slipped 2.1 percent.  Fuji Heavy, which counts  North America  as its biggest
market for sales, jumped 1.7 percent to 2,741 yen, its highest
level ever. The vehicle and industrial-machinery maker may post
record operating profit of about 70 billion yen for the quarter
ended June 30, buoyed by increased U.S. sales, the Nikkei
newspaper reported on July 13.  Citigroup Beats  Futures on the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent today. The index
gained 0.1 percent yesterday to close at a record high after
earnings of Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest  U.S. bank  by
assets, beat estimates.  “Good corporate earnings in the U.S. are improving
investor sentiment because expectations weren’t that high to
begin with,” said  Toshihiko Matsuno , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest lender by market value. “The yen weakened past 100
again, boosting optimism about earnings.”  The yen touched 100.07 per dollar today, compared with
99.22 on July 12. It has fallen about 20 percent against the
greenback since mid-November, solidifying its place as the
worst-performing major currency. A weaker yen boosts the value
of Japanese exporters’ overseas earnings when repatriated.  Among other shares that rose, Tokyo Electric Power Co.
surged 13 percent to 768 yen, the biggest increase on the  Nikkei
225 . The utility, also known as Tepco, has more than tripled
this year amid increased optimism the government will allow
restarts of nuclear  power plants  shuttered after the 2011
earthquake and nuclear meltdown.  Surging Buybacks  Topix companies bought 1.78 trillion yen ($17.8 billion) of
their own shares in the six months to June, the most since 2005,
as they sought to spend some of their record 115 trillion yen in
cash, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buybacks may
double to 3.8 trillion yen this fiscal year, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said in an April 24 report.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange became the world’s third-biggest
bourse by listed companies today, adding 1,100 stocks from the
Osaka Securities Exchange as the two bourses merged their cash-equity trading platforms. The TSE now has 3,423 companies. TSE
first-section stocks increased by 38 to 1,760.  Nintendo closed at 12,720 yen today in Tokyo, 5.6 percent
higher than its last price on July 12 in Osaka and its highest
level since March 2012. The Kyoto, western Japan-based company
has started offering free software to help develop games for its
WiiU console, the Sankei newspaper said on July 15.  Tokyo Arrivals  Murata Manufacturing Co. (6981) , an electronic-component maker
that also changed its main market, closed at 7,540 yen in Tokyo
today, 3.3 percent lower than its 7,800 yen close in Osaka on
July 12. Nidec Corp., a small precision-motor maker that also
moved to the TSE today, closed at 7260 yen in Tokyo, up 2.7
percent from its July 12 closing price of 7,070 yen in Osaka.  Among stocks that fell, KLab Inc. plunged 22 percent to
1,259 yen, the biggest loss on the Topix and the online video-game producer’s largest drop since listing in September 2011.
The company posted a net loss of 770 million yen for the nine
months ended May.  The Topix traded at 1.28 times  book value  on July 12,
compared with 2.48 for the  S&P 500  yesterday and 1.68 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The Topix’s 30-day  historic volatility 
was at 32.35 today, retreating from its July 2 high of 43.22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
