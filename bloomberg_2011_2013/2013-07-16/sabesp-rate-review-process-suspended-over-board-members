Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo ,  Brazil ’s biggest water provider, has had its rate-review suspended by the Sao Paulo state water and energy
regulator Arsesp due to a lack of board members.  The five-member regulatory board wasn’t able to reach
consensus on two decisions including holding a public hearing on
new fees, the water utility known as Sabesp said today, citing a
decision published on Sao Paulo’s official gazette.  The Arsesp board requires at least three members to approve
decisions and two posts haven’t been filled, Sabesp said in a
statement. A third member still hasn’t taken a position. Sabesp
shares declined today in Sao Paulo trading, dropping 1.5 percent
to 22.46 reais. They’ve lost 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
