Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer by market value, agreed to sell a life insurance unit in
Japan that is closed to new customers to Tokyo-based  SBI
Holdings Inc. (8473)  for $85 million.  The sale of PCA Life Japan, which stopped writing new
business in February 2010, is subject to regulatory approval,
London-based Prudential said in a statement today.  “The proposed sale is consistent with Prudential’s
strategy of allocating its capital to markets where it is well
positioned to generate attractive long-term returns for
shareholders,” Prudential said in the statement.  The insurer is focused on business in fast-growing
economies in southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, Indonesia and
the Philippines. Prudential remains committed to the Japanese
market through its Asian asset-management business, Eastspring
Investments, the company said.  Prudential  shares  rose 0.5 percent to 1,131 pence at 12:40
p.m. in London trading, valuing the company at about 29 billion
pounds ($44 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
