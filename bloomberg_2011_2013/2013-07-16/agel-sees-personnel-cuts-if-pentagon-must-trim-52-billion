The ranks of U.S. military personnel
will have to be further reduced if the Pentagon must absorb $52
billion in budget cuts next year under the process called
sequestration, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said today.  Sequestration is a “dumb way” to reduce personnel, Hagel
said during a visit to the Jacksonville Naval Air Station in
 Florida . Hagel said a Pentagon strategic review that he will
issue soon will recommend “consolidations,” which he didn’t
specify.  The personnel cuts are likely to include a 20 percent
reduction to the office of secretary of defense as well as that
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Hagel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
