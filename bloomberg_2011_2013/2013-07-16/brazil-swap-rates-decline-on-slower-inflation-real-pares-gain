Brazil ’s swap rates declined to a
one-month low after a report showed inflation slowed, damping
speculation that the central bank will increase borrowing costs
at a faster place.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 9.49 percent at 9:48
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , the lowest level on a closing basis since
June 11. The real gained less than 0.1 percent to 2.2191 per
 U.S. dollar  after rising 0.5 percent earlier today and rallying
2.1 percent yesterday in the biggest gain since June 2012.  The Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today that its
IGP-10 inflation index, which monitors wholesale, construction
and consumer prices, increased 0.43 percent in the month ended
July 10, less than the 0.56 percent forecast of 21 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg and the prior 0.63 percent increase.  “The inflation indexes are showing improvement,”  Gustavo Rangel , the chief Latin America economist at ING Bank NV in
 London , said in a telephone interview. “This doesn’t eliminate
the need for more rate increases at the next meeting, but the
spike in inflation becomes a little less worrying.”  Policy makers raised the  target lending rate  by a half-percentage point to 8.50 percent on July 10 in the third
increase this year from a record low 7.25 percent. They raised
it by a quarter-percentage point in April and 50 basis points in
May. The next meeting is scheduled for Aug. 27-28.  The real pared its gain today after a U.S. report showed
consumer prices rose more than forecast, encouraging speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will curtail a stimulus program that
has buoyed emerging-market assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
