The U.K. markets regulator fined
Swinton Group Ltd. 7.4 million pounds ($11.2 million) for mis-selling personal accident, home emergency and car breakdown
insurance policies.  The Financial Conduct Authority found that Swinton didn’t
give customers enough information about the terms of the
policies and didn’t sufficiently monitor its sales calls.
Swinton set aside 11.2 million pounds to repay customers who
were mis-sold insurance, the regulator said in a statement
today.  “Swinton acknowledges the shortcomings in its sales
practices during this period, and the company unreservedly
apologizes to customers,” the insurer said in a statement. It
has contacted more than 650,000 customers who may be entitled to
redress and paid out 1.9 million pounds so far, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
