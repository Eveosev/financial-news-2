Lawmakers in Libya’s interim
parliament approved a law that will govern the membership of a
committee to draft a new constitution more than two years after
the overthrow of Muammar Qaddafi.  The law calls for elections to be held to select the 60
members who draft the charter and six seats to be reserved for
women.  Libya’s bid to write a constitution has been repeatedly
delayed because of political disputes, undermining Prime
Minister Ali Zaidan’s efforts to lure foreign investors to the
country. Libya sits on  Africa ’s largest oil reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
