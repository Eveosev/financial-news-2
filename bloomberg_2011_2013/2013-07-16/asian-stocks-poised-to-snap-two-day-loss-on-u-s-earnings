 interest rates .  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera maker that gets 27

very good tactical rebound,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based
head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.,
which manages more than $130 billion. “We started the quarter
with the earnings expectation for the June quarter at around 5.5
percent and came all the way down to 2.4 percent. Chances are
final results will be better than that.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 4.3 percent this year
through yesterday and traded at 13.2 times estimated earnings.

rates. The central bank increased the marginal standing facility
and the bank rate to 10.25 percent from 8.25 percent, and said

moves that worsen a tightening in liquidity across most of the
biggest  emerging markets .  State Bank of India  tumbled 4.1
percent to 1,833 rupees.  Higher Rates  The tightening “will be negative for the equity markets in
