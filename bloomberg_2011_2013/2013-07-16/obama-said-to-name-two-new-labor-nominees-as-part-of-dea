President  Barack Obama  has selected
two new candidates for the National Labor Relations Board as
part of a deal in the  U.S. Senate  that will clear the way for
votes on some of his nominees to other top posts.  Obama plans to nominate Nancy Schiffer, a former top lawyer
for the AFL-CIO, and Kent Hirozawa, counsel to NLRB Chairman
Mark Gaston Pearce, according to two people familiar with the
issue who asked not to be identified because the names haven’t
been announced. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee has already set hearings next week for the new
nominees, indicating lawmakers expect to take quick action.  Arizona  Republican Senator  John McCain , who helped
negotiate the agreement, said today that the Senate would vote
on their nominations by Aug. 1.  The broader agreement broke a deadlock over Obama’s
nominees to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Labor Department.  As part of the deal agreed to by Republican and Democratic
senators, the White House pulled their previous picks -- Sharon Block and  Richard Griffin  -- both of whom had drawn Republican
objections. With Republicans blocking those nominations, Obama
had installed them as recess appointments.  Their appointments were ruled invalid on Jan. 25 by a
federal appeals court in Washington. The administration appealed
to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to consider the case in
its 2013-2014 term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
