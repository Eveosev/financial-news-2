Indonesia ’s rupiah extended losses
beyond 10,000 per dollar for a second day on concern demand for
exports from Southeast Asia’s biggest economy will wane as
regional growth slows.  The currency traded at its weakest since September 2009 and
has lost 1.1 percent this month after official data July 1
showed overseas shipments contracted for a 14th consecutive
month in May. Asian Development Bank joined the International
Monetary Fund in lowering forecasts for developing Asia, saying
the slowdown in China will hurt the regional outlook. The yield
on 10-year sovereign bonds reached a two-year high.  “The risk of external imbalances remains very much alive
and that could add further pressure on the currency,” Leo Rinaldy, an economist at PT Mandiri Sekuritas in Jakarta, wrote
in a research note today. Global risk against the rupiah is
driven by  China ’s economic slowdown, while the U.S. bond-tapering plan supports the dollar, he said.  The rupiah declined 0.2 percent to 10,035 per dollar as of
5:12 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month non-deliverable forwards fell
1.2 percent to 10,363.  The exchange rate is in line with market conditions and
economic fundamentals, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo said in a mobile-phone text message yesterday.  “We think Bank Indonesia has given a wider band for the
rupiah to depreciate, just as we have mentioned previously, as
it could not always intervene in the spot market,” Rinaldy
wrote.  Dwindling Reserves  Indonesia’s foreign-exchange reserves dropped 6.7 percent
to $98 billion in June, a sign the central bank has been selling
dollars to support the rupiah. The  holdings  are the lowest since
January 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, increased 50 basis
points, or 0.50 percentage point, to 11.19 percent.  Gross domestic product in developing Asia will probably
increase 6.3 percent in 2013 and 6.4 percent next year, the
Manila-based ADB said in a report today. In April, it forecast
expansion of 6.6 percent this year and 6.7 percent in 2014.  The IMF reduced its growth estimate for the region earlier
this month to 6.9 percent from 7.2 percent.  Indonesia’s government bonds fell. The yield on the 5.625
percent notes due May 2023 climbed eight basis points to 8.3
percent, the highest level for a benchmark 10-year security
since March 2011, according to prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association.  The government sold 10.65 trillion rupiah of bills and
bonds maturing in one to 30 years today, exceeding the
indicative target of 7.5 trillion rupiah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
