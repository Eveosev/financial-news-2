A boat carrying about 150 people
suspected of seeking asylum capsized north of  Australia ’s
 Christmas Island , the country’s Customs and Border Protection
Service said.  Four bodies were recovered and 144 survivors were picked up
by navy ships, the service said in a statement on its  website .  The HMAS Albany and the HMAS Warramunga had been escorting
the boat to Christmas Island when it capsized. The agency
statement said sailors from its boats and aircraft in the area
helped rescue those in the water. A further search for survivors
was suspended in the area after a “thorough search,” it said
in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
