India’s benchmark banking shares
 index  slumped the most in more than four years after the
country’s central bank increased two  interest rates , boosting
the cost of funds.  The S&P BSE Bankex index, a gauge of 13 local lenders,
slumped 4.8 percent in Mumbai, the biggest drop since July 6,
2009, after the  Reserve Bank  of India yesterday announced the
rate increases.  State Bank of India , the nation’s largest, fell
4.4 percent to 1,827.65 rupees.  The central bank increased the marginal standing facility
rate to a record 10.25 percent from 8.25 percent and boosted the
 bank rate  to the same level, tightening funding conditions after
the rupee fell to a record low against the dollar last week.
With lending growth at a three-year low, higher rates will make
it difficult to pass on funding costs, said Vishal Narnolia, a
Mumbai-based bank analyst at SMC Global Securities Ltd.  “Banks’ profitability will take a hit after this rate
hike,” Narnolia said by phone. “The lenders will now have to
raise deposit rates or borrow funds from money markets at higher
rates.”  Bank lending in  India  grew 14 percent in the year to June
14, the slowest pace in at least three years, data compiled by
the RBI show, as the cooling economy curtailed credit demand.
The  economy  expanded 5 percent in the year ended March 31, the
slowest pace since 2003, government data show.  ‘Unexpected Measure’  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , India’s second-largest lender, fell 5.4
percent to 1,003.45 rupees, while  Yes Bank Ltd. (YES) , the worst
performer on the Bankex index, plunged 9.9 percent to 450.95
rupees.  Canara Bank  fell 8.6 percent and Punjab National Bank
fell 5.5 percent in Mumbai trading.  “The cost of borrowing will go up and liquidity will dry
up following the measures announced yesterday,” said V.K. Sharma, chief executive officer at  LIC Housing Finance Ltd. (LICHF) ,
India’s second-largest mortgage company. “This unexpected
measure will put lending margins under pressure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
