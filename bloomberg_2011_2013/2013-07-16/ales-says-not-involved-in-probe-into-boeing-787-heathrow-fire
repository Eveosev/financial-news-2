Thales SA (HO)  said it’s playing no part
in an ongoing probe into a fire on a Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner
jet at London’s Heathrow airport last week.  The French company, which provides electrical power
conversion technology to the 787, is “not involved” in an
investigaton that has been extended to include rival avionics
supplier Honeywell Inc., spokesman Alexandre Perra said in an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News.  Thales participated in a previous probe of the Dreamliner
following fires linked to the plane’s lithium ion batteries,
which it had sourced from  Japan ’s GS Yuasa Corp. and supplied to
Boeing. That investigation grounded the 787 for three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
