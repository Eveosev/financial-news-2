Singapore ’s central bank said today
local lenders have “adequate buffers” to cope with higher
interest rates after Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook
for the banking system on concern borrowing costs may climb.  Moody’s lowered its outlook to negative from stable
yesterday, citing rapid loan growth and rising real estate
prices. Record home prices amid low interest rates have prompted
the government to widen a four-year campaign to curb speculation
prices in Asia’s second-most expensive housing market.  “MAS has been concerned that some borrowers are at risk of
being overstretched, especially when interest rates rise,” the
Monetary Authority of Singapore said in an e-mailed statement.
“However, the local banks are not at risk.”  Singapore’s banks undertake regular stress tests on their
own and those coordinated by the MAS, and have enough capital to
cope with the ’’inevitable upturn’’ in borrowing costs, the
central bank said.  The MAS has been monitoring risks and has taken pre-emptive
measures for the property market, it said. The central bank is
also watching banks’ credit underwriting practices to ensure
they remain “prudent,” the authority said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
