Indonesian political party Gerindra,
led by ex-general Prabowo Subianto, will aim to boost annual
growth in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy to 7-10 percent if
elected to power next year.  Gerindra vowed to lift per capita annual income in the
world’s fourth-most populous nation by over 70 percent to
$6,000, through measures such as developing industry, building
infrastructure and more efficient  government spending , the party
said in a full page manifesto in the Jakarta Globe today.  Prabowo has topped some surveys in the past year as a
choice to run the country, though he was beaten by Jakarta
Governor Joko Widodo in a May poll by the Centre for Strategic
and International Studies, the Jakarta Post reported.  Some of Gerindra’s policies mirror those of current
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, also a former general.
Yudhoyono’s goal was to reach 9 percent growth, though annual
expansion peaked at 6.5 percent in 2011 and gross domestic
product increased 6.02 percent in the first quarter of 2013, the
slowest in over two years.  Yudhoyono, re-elected on a platform to fight graft, whose
administration has been beset by corruption scandals, cannot run
for a third term and his Democrat Party has yet to name a
successor, leaving the race for 2014 elections wide open.  Gerindra also pledged to combat corruption, lift state
revenues to 16 percent of gross domestic product by improving
tax collection, and to open up 2 million acres of new land to
increase  food production , according to the manifesto.  Presidential candidates need support from parties that win
at least 20 percent of seats in the 560-member  House of
Representatives  in April elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
