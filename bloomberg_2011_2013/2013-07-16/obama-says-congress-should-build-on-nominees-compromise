President  Barack Obama  urged
Congress to use the spirit of compromise that cleared the way
for his nominees in the U.S. Senate to help advance legislative
priorities such as a new immigration law.  Obama praised leaders of both parties for reaching a deal
that broke a deadlock on his nominations for heads of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Labor Department.  “I hope the Congress will build on this spirit of
cooperation to advance other urgent middle-class priorities,
including the need to take action to pass commonsense
immigration reform and keep interest rates on student loans low
for families trying to afford a higher education,” the
president said in a statement released today by the White House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
