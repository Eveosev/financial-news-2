Hog futures rose for the second
straight day on speculation that unusually hot weather in the
U.S. Midwest will slow weight gains of animals, curbing pork
production. Cattle declined.  A heat wave will descend on the Midwest over the next three
days, with temperatures in  Des Moines ,  Iowa , reaching 9 degrees
to 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, said Don Keeney, an
agricultural meteorologist at MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The  weight  of hog carcasses fell 0.6
percent last week, the biggest decline since May 24, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  “With this heat and humidity coming, these hogs are really
going to slow down, so supply is going to slow,” Lou Arens, a
broker at PCI Advisory Services in Waucoma, Iowa, said in a
telephone interview. “Packers are still needing hogs.”  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.6 percent to 85.2
cents a pound at 10:17 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The contract was down 1.4 percent this year through yesterday.  Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1.26225 a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle futures for August
delivery declined 0.4 percent to $1.52025 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
