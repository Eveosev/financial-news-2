Freddie Mac  plans to sell $400
million of a new type of debt tied to the risk that homeowners
will fail to repay mortgages, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The government-controlled mortgage-finance company is
expected to begin marketing the bonds tomorrow in an offering
managed by Credit Suisse Group AG, said the person, who asked
not to be named because terms arenâ€™t set.  The deal reflects an effort by the Federal Housing Finance
Agency to reduce the role of Freddie Mac and  Fannie Mae  in the
residential-mortgage market, where government-backed loans now
account for more than 85 percent of lending. The FHFA, which has
overseen the firms since they were seized in 2008, has been
directing them to raise how much they charge to guarantee their
traditional mortgage bonds and asked them to each attempt to
share risk this year on $30 billion of home loans.  The new bonds being sold by McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie
Mac (FMCC)  will be direct obligations of the company, rather than
mortgage-backed securities, the person said.  The deal includes two floating-rate notes, each totaling
$200 million, the person said. Their projected average lives are
2.2 years and 8.2 years, the person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
