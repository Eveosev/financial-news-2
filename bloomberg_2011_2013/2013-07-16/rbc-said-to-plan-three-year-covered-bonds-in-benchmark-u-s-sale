Royal Bank of Canada , the nation’s
largest lender by assets, is planning to sell $1.75 billion of
three-year, dollar-denominated covered bonds as soon as today.  The notes, expected to be rated Aaa by Moody’s Investors
Service, may yield 35 basis points more than the mid-swap rate,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  RBC’s $2.5 billion of covered bonds due September 2017
traded yesterday at 98 cents on the dollar to yield 1.7 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley, and Toronto-based
RBC are managing the offering, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because terms aren’t set.  Covered bonds, a form of secured financing pioneered in
18th-century Prussia, are backed by assets such as mortgages or
loans and guaranteed by the issuer, letting banks fund more
cheaply than with traditional debt and providing investors with
top-rated securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
