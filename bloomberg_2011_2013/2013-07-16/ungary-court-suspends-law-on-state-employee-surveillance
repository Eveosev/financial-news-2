Hungary’s Constitutional Court
suspended parts of a law that would have permitted continuous
surveillance of state employees subject to security clearance.  The legislation, which was due to take effect Aug. 1, would
have “seriously limited” the right to privacy by allowing
monitoring even after the employees had been cleared for a job,
the court said today in a  ruling  posted on its website.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who wields a two-thirds
parliamentary majority, has faced criticism from the European
Union, United Nations and U.S. for eroding checks and balances
after extending his influence over independent institutions
including the courts, the media regulator and the central bank.  The parts of the law that were suspended would have allowed
the security services to “secretly” gather information on
state employees for 30-day periods twice a year, the court said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
