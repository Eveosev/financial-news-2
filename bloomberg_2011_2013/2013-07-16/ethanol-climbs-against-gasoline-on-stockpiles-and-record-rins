Ethanol gained for a second day
against gasoline on concern that the U.S. will struggle to
replenish stockpiles of the biofuel. The value of Renewable
Identification Numbers reached a record high.  The spread, or price difference, tightened 3.46 cents to
57.73 cents a gallon. A July 10 government report showed
 inventories  in the Midwest are down 18 percent from a year
earlier. RINs for  corn-based ethanol  surged to $1.35 today from
7 cents in January while  advanced varieties , which cover
biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based biofuel jumped to $1.36
from 37 cents in January.  “On the ethanol side, all they’re talking about is how
tight stocks are in Chicago,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant
at INTL FCStone in Des Moines,  Iowa . “Plus, RINs are firm.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery increased 6.6 cents,
or 2.7 percent, to $2.557 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have gained 17 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery gained 3.14 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.1343 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The oil industry and ethanol companies are arguing about
whether the U.S. should maintain consumption targets. The Senate
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a  meeting  today
on gasoline and fuel prices.  House Hearings  The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans hearings on
the Renewable Fuels Standard on July 23 and July 24, a
spokeswoman said yesterday. The measure requires refiners to use
13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this year.  RINs, certificates attached to each gallon of biofuel, are
used to track compliance with the mandate.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. Last summer’s drought
wilted crops and eroded returns to make the biofuel.  Production of ethanol averaged 881,000 barrels a day in the
week ended July 5, data from the Energy Information
Administration show, down 8.5 percent from the record in
December 2011.  Corn for September delivery advanced 9 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $5.4525 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts for the grain and biofuel, was 39 cents, up
from 38 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Attracting Imports  Seasonally above-average ethanol prices have attracted
increased imports of the fuel, data from the Energy Department’s
research unit show.  Foreign purchases  of ethanol averaged 25,000
barrels a day in the week ended July 5, up 39 percent from the
same period a year earlier, the EIA said in the July 10 report.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York advanced 3.5
cents to $2.72 a gallon; in Chicago the fuel climbed 2 cents to
$2.62; in the U.S. Gulf prices rose 2 cents to $2.695; and on
the West Coast the additive jumped 1 cent to $2.685 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
