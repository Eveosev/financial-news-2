The  Green Bay Packers ’ profit from
operations rose by $11.4 million to a club-record $54.3 million
in fiscal 2013, thanks to falling costs that Chief Executive
 Mark Murphy  credited in part on late signings by  Aaron Rodgers 
and  Clay Matthews .  Murphy said player expenses for the only publicly owned
franchise in the four major North American sports leagues were
about $19 million less than in 2012, partly because recent
contract extensions with Rodgers, a Super Bowl-winning
quarterback, and Matthews, a Pro Bowl linebacker, won’t count on
the books until fiscal 2014.  “We’ll see the impact of that on the financial numbers
next year,” Murphy said yesterday in a conference call with
reporters. “But not having those in last year’s numbers I think
inflated our profit from operations.”  The profit in fiscal 2012 also set a club record.  Rodgers, the NFL’s Most Valuable Player in 2012, signed a
five-year contract extension in April worth $110 million,
 according to  the Green Bay Press Gazette. Matthews, a four-time
Pro Bowl selection,  signed a  five-year, $69.77 million extension
also in April, the newspaper said.  Net income also rose, increasing about 1 percent to a
record $43.1 million from $42.7 million in 2012, according to
numbers sent by the team.  Total revenue was up about 2 percent to a record $308.1
million from $302 million, Murphy said. National revenue rose
about 5 percent to $179.9 million from $171.6 million, helped by
the league’s new apparel agreement with  Nike Inc. (NKE)  and new deals
with cable providers to carry the league’s NFL Network, he said.  Expense Drop  Expenses fell about 2 percent to $253.8 million from $259
million, the team said.  “The combination of revenue going up and expenses down
allowed us to have a record profit from operations, which was a
relatively significant increase from last year,” Murphy said.  Green Bay Packers Inc. has been a publicly owned, non-profit corporation since August 1932, according to the team’s
website. Last year, the team conducted the fifth stock sale in
franchise history, adding about 250,000 shareholders and raising
$64 million. The shares pay no dividend and cannot be resold,
except back to the team for a fraction of the original price.  The Packers finished last season with an 11-5 record,
earning their fourth consecutive playoff appearance, including a
Super Bowl victory in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
