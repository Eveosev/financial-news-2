Cyrela  Brazil  Realty SA, Brazil’s
biggest homebuilder by market value, rose to a five-week high as
booked sales recovered and a report showing slowed inflation
reduced prospects for steeper increases in  interest rates .  Shares climbed 2 percent to 16.37 reais at 1:12 p.m. in Sao
Paulo after earlier advancing as much as 4.7 percent to the
highest intraday price since June 7.  MRV Engenharia e
Participacoes SA , Brazil’s third-biggest homebuilder, rallied
3.1 percent to 6.70, the best performance on the Ibovespa, after
reporting an increase in quarterly booked sales. The benchmark
equity  gauge  fell 0.6 percent.  Cyrela’s sales gain in the second quarter is a sign that
homebuilders began to rebound after Brazil’s slowdown reduced
revenue, according to Sandro Fernandes, a trader at brokerage
Geraldo Correa.  “We notice that all these companies are making a lot of
effort to sell their inventories, and that seems to be paying
off,” Fernandes said by phone from  Belo Horizonte , Brazil.  Booked sales of Cyrela soared 66 percent to 2.18 billion
reais ($970 million) in the second quarter from a year earlier,
according to a regulatory filing yesterday. In the three months
through June last year, contracted sales had fallen 21 percent
from 2011. MRV’s booked sales rose 47 percent to 1.38 billion
reais in the second quarter from a year earlier.  Slower Inflation  Swap rates fell today as wholesale, construction and
consumer prices rose in the month ended July 10 at a slower
pace, damping speculation that the central bank will increase
borrowing costs at a faster place.  Consumer, wholesale and construction prices as measured by
Fundacao Getulio Vargas’ IGP-10 index rose 0.43 percent in July
from June, below the median estimate of 0.56 percent among 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Swap rates on contracts due in
January 2015 fell 0.04 percentage point to 9.51 percent.  As inflation slows, prospects for homebuilders improve,
Fernandes said. “That means policy makers won’t have to raise
interest rates as much as previously estimated, which is good
for companies that depend on financing to sell,” he said.  Brazil’s central bank raised the target lending rate by a
half-percentage point to 8.50 percent on July 10 in the third
increase this year from a record low 7.25 percent. The next
meeting is scheduled for Aug. 27-28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
