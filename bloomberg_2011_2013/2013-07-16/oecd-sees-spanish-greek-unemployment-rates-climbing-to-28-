Unemployment rates in  Spain  and
 Greece  are set to rise to 28 percent by the end of next year as
the countries struggle to recover from Europe’s debt crisis, the
 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  said.  The jobless rate will increase to 27.8 percent in Spain
from 26.9 percent currently, the Paris-based organization
predicted. In Greece, the rate will rise to 28.2 percent from
26.8 percent, according to the report.  “The social scars of the crisis are far from being
healed,” OECD Secretary-General  Angel Gurria  said in a
statement. “Many of our countries continue to struggle with
high and persistent unemployment, particularly among youth.”  The report highlights the growing disparity between
developed countries as their economies recover differently from
a global financial crisis that began with the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. In contrast to southern European
countries, the unemployment rate in the U.S. will drop below 7
percent by the end of next year, while the rate in  Germany  will
decline to less than 5 percent, according to the forecasts.  In France and Italy, the euro area’s second- and third-largest economies, jobless rates are predicted to increase to
11.2 percent and 12.6 percent respectively by the end of 2014,
the OECD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
