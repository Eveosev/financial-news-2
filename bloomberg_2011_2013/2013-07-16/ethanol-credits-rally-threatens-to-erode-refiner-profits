The soaring cost of ethanol credits
may erode full-year profits for U.S. crude-oil refiners by more
than 15 percent, said Faisel Khan, Citigroup Inc.’s managing
director of integrated oil and research.  The run-up in corn-based  ethanol credits  known as Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, may reduce refiner earnings by
more than 15 percent this year, exceeding Khan’s earlier
estimate of 5 percent to 15 percent, the analyst said at a
Senate hearing in  Washington  today.  The price of RINs jumped more than 1,800 percent this year
to a record $1.35 a gallon today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Demand for RINs has climbed after the worst drought
in eight decades boosted corn prices last year, quashing ethanol
output, and refiners grappled with limits on how much of the
additive can be safely burned in  car engines .  Given the most recent price surge, “costs could move much
higher than what we have in our numbers,” Khan said.  Federal law mandates that refiners add specified quantities
of ethanol to the gasoline they produce each year, or purchase
RINs to cover those amounts.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  will kick off the earnings season for
U.S. refiners when the San Antonio-based company announces
second-quarter results on July 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
