Energy Recovery Inc. (ERII) , which supplies
technology to the desalination industry, will install equipment
at an  Acciona SA (ANA)  plant in Chile’s northern Atacama desert set to
produce fresh water for local mining operations.  The technology may save Acciona $1.9 million a year on
power costs in a first phase of the desalination project, San
Leandro, California-based Energy Recovery said today in a
statement. A second phase may see annual savings rise by a
further $1.5 million, it said without disclosing terms.  Atacama, one of the world’s most arid regions, is rich in
copper and lithium resources. The desalination project will
initially produce about 22 million liters (5.8 million gallons)
of water, according to the statement.  “Chile is on the forefront of a major desalination boom
and we are proud to help contribute to the country’s economic
development in this regard,” Tom Rooney, chief executive
officer of Energy Recovery, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
