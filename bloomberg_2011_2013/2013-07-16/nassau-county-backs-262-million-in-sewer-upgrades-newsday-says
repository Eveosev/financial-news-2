The Nassau County legislature
approved $262 million for sewage and water-treatment repairs,
part of $722 million being sought to fund capital projects
following  Hurricane Sandy , Newsday reported.  The  New York  newspaper said the legislature unanimously
approved the funding, much of which would go to repair damage
caused last year and to upgrade the wastewater-treatment system
against future storms.  The paper cited Chief Deputy County Executive Rob Walker as
saying he was confident the Federal Emergency Management Agency
would reimburse 90 percent of the costs and that damage to the
electrical system at the Bay Park sewage treatment plant is
among the most urgent repairs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
