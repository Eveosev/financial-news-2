Canadian  factory sales  rose in May
on gains in chemicals and metals while inventories fell from a
record high, government figures showed.  Sales climbed 0.7 percent to C$48.6 billion ($46.7 billion)
in May, leaving them 3.2 percent below their level from 12
months earlier,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa.
Economists forecast a 0.8 percent monthly increase, according to
the median of a Bloomberg  survey  with 15 responses.  Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz, who has said
Canada’s expansion requires “patience,” will probably keep his
 benchmark interest rate  at 1 percent tomorrow where it’s been
since September 2010, according to a Bloomberg economist survey.
The world’s 11th largest economy has been slowed by weak foreign
demand, leading to the longest streak of trade deficits in a
quarter century.  “It’s likely going to be a bumpy road for manufacturing
for some time,” said Mazen Issa, Canada macro strategist at TD
Securities in Toronto. The industry needs stronger U.S. growth
to have a recovery later this year after a long period of weak
sales, he said by telephone.  The Canadian dollar was little changed at C$1.0432 at 10:01
a.m. in Toronto today. One dollar buys 95.86 U.S. cents.  Inventories dropped for the first time in five months, by
0.2 percent to C$69 billion. The ratio of factory stockpiles to
sales fell to 1.42 from 1.43, declining from the highest since
late 2009, according to the report.  Quebec Declines  Sales in  Quebec , the second-largest manufacturing province
after Ontario, fell to the lowest since September 2009.
Manufacturing receipts dropped 2.8 percent to C$10.7 billion on
petroleum and coal in May, capping a 10.2 percent decline over
the past 12 months.  Nationwide, sales rose in 11 of 21  categories  tracked by
Statistics Canada in May, accounting for 57 percent of
production.  Chemicals advanced 5.1 percent to C$3.98 billion in May, in
part because wet and cold weather delayed farm purchases of
fertilizer, according to the report. Primary metal sales rose
4.0 percent to C$3.55 billion.  Unfilled orders rose 0.6 percent to C$71.2 billion in May,
Statistics Canada said, while new orders rose 1.8 percent to
C$49 billion.  Sales excluding motor vehicles and parts increased 0.7
percent to C$42.3 billion, Statistics  Canada  said.  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales also
rose 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
