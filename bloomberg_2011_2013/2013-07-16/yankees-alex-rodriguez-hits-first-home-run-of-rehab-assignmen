Alex Rodriguez of the  New York 
Yankees hit the first home run of his minor-league
rehabilitation stint, a two-run shot in his debut for the
Double-A Trenton Thunder.  Rodriguez, 37, who is fifth on Major League Baseball’s
career list with 647 home runs, hasn’t played for the Yankees
this season while recovering from left hip surgery in January.  Rodriguez’s two-run homer in the fifth inning of Trenton’s
6-5 win in Reading,  Pennsylvania , last night was his first since
Sept. 14, 2012. It was the ninth game of Rodriguez’s 20-day
minor-league rehab, which ends July 22.  The Yankees’ third baseman went 2-for-4 last night and is
5-for-25 with five runs batted in during his rehab assignment.  Rodriguez hit .272 for the Yankees last season with 18 home
runs and 57 runs batted in. The three-time American League Most
Valuable Player batted .120 with 12 strikeouts in 25 at-bats
during the postseason and then in January had surgery to repair
a torn labrum in his left hip.  Baseball is continuing to investigate Rodriguez’s link to a
now-closed anti-aging clinic in  Florida  that the Miami New Times
said provided players with performance-enhancing drugs.
Rodriguez is among as many as 20 players said to face suspension
in the league’s investigation of Biogenesis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
