Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB shares
fell for a third straight day as  Mexico ’s third-largest bank
prepares to sell as much as $2.3 billion of stock in the
country’s biggest equity offering this year.  The shares fell 0.1 percent to 72.28 pesos at 11:30 a.m.
Mexico City time, after dropping 1.2 percent in the two previous
sessions. The country’s benchmark  IPC index  fell 1.8 percent,
the worst performance among 18 major world equity indexes
tracked by Bloomberg.  Banorte is raising money through a follow-on share sale to
finance  acquisitions  at a time when Mexican companies have been
delaying or scaling back equity offerings. The benchmark IPC
index of 35 stocks plunged last month to the  lowest level  since
September 2011, and is down 9.4 percent this year. Banorte pared
its planned offering earlier this month from a previously
targeted $3 billion.  The Mexico City-based company, the country’s biggest bank
by outstanding loans, now plans to sell $2 billion of stock,
with a 15 percent overallotment option for underwriters,
according to a July 3 filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
