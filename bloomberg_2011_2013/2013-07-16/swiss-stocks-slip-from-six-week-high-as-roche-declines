Stocks in Switzerland  fell from
their highest level in more than six weeks as investors awaited
monthly reports on German confidence and U.S. industrial output.  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , which constitutes 17 percent of the Swiss
Market Index, lost 1.5 percent. Actelion Ltd. slid 1.7 percent.  The SMI lost 0.4 percent to 7,964.11 at 9:58 a.m. in
Zurich. The equity benchmark advanced 2.6 percent last week as
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the  U.S. economy 
still needs stimulus measures from the central bank. The broader
Swiss Performance Index declined 0.5 percent today.  German  investor confidence  increased in July, a report may
show at 11 a.m. in Mannheim, Germany. The ZEW Center for
European Economic Researchâ€™s index of investor and analyst
expectations rose to 40 this month from 38.5 in June, economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted.  In the U.S., output at factories, mines and utilities
advanced 0.3 percent in June after stagnating in May, according
to the median estimate of economists. The Federal Reserve will
release the data at 9:15 a.m.  New York  time.  In Switzerland, Novartis AG and Actelion are among SMI-listed companies reporting results this week. The  SMI (SMI)  is trading
at 15 times projected earnings, compared to 15.65 times in May,
which was the highest level since December 2009.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 32 percent lower than the 30-day average today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
