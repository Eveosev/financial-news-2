Crude options volatility was steady
as futures changed little following two days of gains.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options, was 21.63 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 2:30 p.m., up from 21.39 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery fell
23 cents to settle at $105.69 a barrel on the Nymex. August
futures slipped 32 cents to $106.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
September $100 puts, which rose 8 cents to 88 cents a barrel on
volume of 6,655 lots traded at 2:38 p.m. August $110 calls were
the second-most active, falling 6 cents to 3 cents on volume of
4,758 contracts.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the prior session, bearish options also made up 54 percent of
115,962 contracts exchanged.  August $102 puts were the most-active options yesterday,
with 4,465 contracts changing hands as they declined 9 cents to
6 cents a barrel. August $105 puts slipped 35 cents to 34 cents
on 3,996 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
39,012 contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 36,316 lots
and September $90 puts with 36,058.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
