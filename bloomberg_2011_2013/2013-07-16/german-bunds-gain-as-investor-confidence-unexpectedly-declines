German 10-year  government bonds 
gained as a report showed investor confidence in Europe’s
largest economy unexpectedly declined in July.  The  yield  on the bund decreased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.56 percent at 10:06 a.m. London time.
Two-year rates slipped two basis points to 0.10 percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, fell to
36.3 from 38.5 in June. That’s the first decline in three
months. Economists forecast a gain to 40, according to the
median of 37 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
