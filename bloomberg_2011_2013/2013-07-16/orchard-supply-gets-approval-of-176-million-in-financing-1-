Orchard Supply Hardware Stores
Corp., the operator of 91 hardware stores mostly in  California ,
won court approval of as much as $176.3 million in bankruptcy
financing.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Christopher Sontchi , at a hearing
today in Wilmington,  Delaware , approved the loans that will help
fund operations as Orchard pursues a sale for at least 60 stores
with a lead offer of $205 million from  Lowe’s Cos. (LOW)   Orchard Supply has met its “burden that the DIP is
necessary from a business perspective,” Sontchi said at the
hearing. Bankruptcy financing is commonly referred to as a
debtor-in-possession, or DIP, loan.  “I believe the aggregate facility is necessary for the
company” and gives suppliers confidence the company will have
adequate liquidity to continue going forward, Chris Newman,
Orchard Supply’s chief financial officer, told the judge.  The home-improvement retailer, based in San Jose,
California, said it sought bankruptcy protection after sales
declined in the state’s deteriorating economy, where 89 of its
stores are located, and the U.S. slipped into the recession in
late 2007. Orchard couldn’t hold on against larger rivals Home
Depot Inc. and Lowe’s, and sales dropped 21 percent from 2007 to
2010.  The Lowe’s bid will be tested at an Aug. 14 auction,
followed by an Aug. 20 hearing to approve the auction winner,
according to court documents. Other potential buyers must submit
bids to compete against Lowe’s by Aug. 9.  The case is In re  Orchard Supply Hardware Stores Corp. (OSHWQ) ,
13-11565, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
