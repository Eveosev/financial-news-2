Central banks should carefully plan
their exits from monetary stimulus to avoid causing sharp
movements of capital, the International Monetary Fund’s Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  said.  A “much more subtle game” is required as policy makers
phase out stimulus measures, Lagarde told reporters today at a
Romanian central bank conference in Bucharest. While
unconventional policies by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the  Bank of
England , the  European Central Bank  and the Bank of Japan had a
“massive positive” effect on the global economy, the impact of
reversing them “remains to be seen,” she said.  “The real question is for how long, when to gradually
phase it out, when is the economy strong enough and demonstrably
so, so that this unconventional monetary policy can be
revised,” Lagarde said. “The unwinding needs to be carefully
phased, planned, communicated.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled last month that the
U.S. central bank may start tapering its $85 billion monthly
stimulus program this year and halt the program in mid-2014 if
the economy performs in line with its forecasts. ECB President
 Mario Draghi  said July 4 that euro-area interest rates will
remain low for an extended period of time and monetary policy
will remain accommodative for as long as needed.  Emerging Europe is probably past the worst of the crisis,
with only Croatia and Slovenia likely to remain in recessions
this year compared with eight countries last year, Lagarde said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
