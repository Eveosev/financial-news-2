Steel reinforcement-bar futures rose
for a fifth day to trade near the highest level in more than two
months as inventory in  China  fell and amid speculation that the
government will bring urbanization plans forward.  Rebar for delivery in January on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange climbed as much as 0.3 percent to 3,678  yuan  ($599) a
metric ton and was at 3,675 yuan at 10:50 a.m. local time.
Futures rose to 3,700 yuan on July 11, the highest price for a
most-active contract since April 22.  Rebar  inventory  tracked by Shanghai’s Steelhome Information
Technology Co. in China fell for the 14th week last week,
declining 2.8 percent.  “China may push forward its urbanization plan to ensure
steady growth,” said Ren Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng Futures
Co. in Jinan.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was little
changed yesterday at $126.90, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  The average spot price for rebar in China climbed 0.2
percent to 3,414 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
