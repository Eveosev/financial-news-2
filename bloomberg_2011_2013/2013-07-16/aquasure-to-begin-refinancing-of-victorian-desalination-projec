AquaSure Pty Ltd. said today that
it’s to begin refinancing A$3.7 billion ($3.4 billion) in bank
debt for its desalination plant in  Australia ’s Victoria state
that was completed last year.  The announcement confirms a July 12 report citing three
people familiar with the matter that the builder of Australia’s
largest desalination plant in Wonthaggi near  Melbourne , which
converts seawater to drinking water, would seek to refinance
loan facilities backing the project.  The group said in an e-mailed statement it plans to
refinance existing bank debt for the plant, may also tap the
bond markets and hired Macquarie Group Ltd. as financial adviser
for the process. Borrowing costs are expected to fall materially
from the original greenfield financing signed in 2009, the
people said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
