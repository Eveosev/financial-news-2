Ricardo Plc (RCDO) , a U.K. developer of
fuel-efficient engines for automakers, gained the most since
September in London trading after saying full-year earnings will
beat analysts predictions as demand improves.  “Market conditions are improving although  Europe  remains
challenging,” Chief Executive Officer Dave Shemmans said in a
statement today. “Our pipeline, balance sheet and operational
delivery give us confidence of further progress in the current
year.”  The company will probably report a 13 percent increase in
pretax profit to 20.9 million pounds ($31.6 million) when it
releases full-year earnings on Sept. 9, according to the average
of five analysts estimates in a survey compiled by Bloomberg.
The company, founded by  Harry Ricardo  in 1915, has boosted its
order book with recent contract wins from the automobile,
defense and marine engine industries.  Ricardo rose as much as 5.7 percent, the most since Sept.
21. The stock traded 5.3 percent higher at 398.5 pence as of
8:30 a.m. local time, giving the company a market value of 207
million pounds. The volume of shares traded was almost three
times the three-month daily average.  Full-year revenue will exceed the prior year both including
and excluding Ricardo-AEA, an environmental consultancy it
acquired in November, the Brighton, England-based company said
in the statement.  Ricardo will probably report a 16 percent increase in full-year revenue to 229 million pounds, according to the average of
seven analysts in a survey compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
