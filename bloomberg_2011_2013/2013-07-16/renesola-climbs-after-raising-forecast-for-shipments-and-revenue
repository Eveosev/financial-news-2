ReneSola Ltd. (SOL) , the Chinese solar
manufacturer that resumed production at a shuttered plant this
month, advanced the most in seven months after boosting its
forecast for sales and shipments on increased international
sales.  ReneSola’s American depositary receipts rose 19 percent to
$3.44 at the close in New York, the most since Dec. 12. Each ADR
is worth two ordinary shares.  Revenue for the second quarter will be $365 million to $375
million, compared with a May  forecast  of $310 million to $330
million, the Jiashan, China-based company said today in a
statement. Shipments will be 760 megawatts to 770 megawatts, up
from earlier expectations of 700 megawatts to 720 megawatts.  ReneSola hasn’t reported a profit since the second quarter
of 2011, as a global oversupply of solar panels drove down
prices. China announced plans yesterday to boost installation
fivefold by 2015, a move aimed at spurring demand and boosting
prices.  The company is also pursuing sales in other regions, and
has “substantially expanded our solar module business in
several key international markets,” Chief Executive Officer Li Xianshou said in the statement.  Shipments for the year will be 2.8 gigawatts to 3
gigawatts, compared with the earlier forecast of 2.7 gigawatts
to 2.9 gigawatts. The company reopened a polysilicon plant in
Sichuan province July 1 after completing upgrades. Polysilicon
is the main raw material in solar cells.  To contact the reporter on this story:
