Brazil ’s real posted the only drop
among major dollar counterparts tracked by Bloomberg after
rallying the most in a year yesterday.  The currency depreciated 1.5 percent to 2.2541 per  U.S.
dollar  at 5:20 p.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real climbed 2.1 percent
yesterday in the biggest gain since June 2012. Swap rates on
contracts maturing in due January 2015 fell 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 9.45 percent, the lowest level on a
closing basis since June 10.  “Yesterday, we had a big appreciation of the real,” Joao Paulo de Gracia Correa, a currency manager at Correparti
Corretora, said in a telephone interview from Curitiba, Brazil.  Other major dollar counterparts including the  Mexican peso 
rose today on speculation Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  will seek in congressional testimony tomorrow to damp
investor expectations for a reduction in stimulus.  Brazil’s swap rates declined to a one-month low after a
report showed inflation slowed, damping speculation that the
central bank will increase borrowing costs at a faster pace.  The Getulio Vargas Foundation said today that its
IGP-10 inflation index, which monitors wholesale, construction
and consumer prices, increased 0.43 percent in the month ended
July 10, less than the 0.56 percent forecast of 21 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg and the prior 0.63 percent increase.  “The inflation indexes are showing improvement,”  Gustavo Rangel , the chief Latin America economist at ING Bank NV in
 London , said in a telephone interview. “This doesn’t eliminate
the need for more rate increases at the next meeting, but the
spike in inflation becomes a little less worrying.”  Rate Decision  Brazil’s policy makers raised the  target lending rate  by a
half-percentage point to 8.50 percent on July 10 in the third
increase this year from a record low 7.25 percent. They raised
it by a quarter-percentage point in April and 50 basis points in
May. The next meeting is scheduled for Aug. 27-28.  Consumer prices rose 6.70 percent in June from a year
earlier, the fastest pace in 20 months, exceeding the 6.50
percent upper level of the central bank’s target range, the
government reported July 5. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 6.77 percent increase.  The real rallied yesterday as Credit Suisse Group AG
boosted its three-month target for the real to 2.20 per dollar
from 2.30 and said it will rally to 2.15 in 12 months, citing
central bank intervention, interest-rate increases to contain
inflation and reduced concern that  China’s economy  is slowing.
Nomura Holdings Inc. said the currency would “at least” return
to 2.20 in coming weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
