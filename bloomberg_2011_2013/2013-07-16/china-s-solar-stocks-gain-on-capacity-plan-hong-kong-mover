Solar stocks led by  China Singyes
Solar Technologies Holdings Ltd. (750)  extended gains in  Hong Kong 
trading after the Chinese government announced plans to boost
capacity.  Singyes, a panel producer and project developer, jumped as
much as 14 percent to HK$9.60 and traded at HK$8.99 as of 10:20
a.m. local time local time.  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the
biggest maker of polysilicon used to make solar panels, rose by
as much as 8.9 percent to HK$1.96.  China, the world’s biggest maker of solar panels, plans to
add 10 gigawatts of solar power a year during the next three
years, according to a statement from the State Council posted on
the government’s website yesterday. The plan would increase the
nation’s solar installed capacity fivefold to more than 35
gigawatts by 2015.  “I think they’re going to sustain these high levels of
growth and soak up some of the excess capacity,” Angelo Zino,
an analyst at  Standard & Poor’s  in New York, said in an
interview.  Oversupply led to a 20 percent  plunge  in the average price
of solar panels last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  China will provide credit support to profitable
photovoltaic manufacturers and encourage restructuring and
overseas investment, according to yesterday’s statement. The
period that the government will consider to measure
profitability wasn’t specified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
