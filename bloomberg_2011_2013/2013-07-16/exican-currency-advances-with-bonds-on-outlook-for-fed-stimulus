Mexico’s peso rose to a one-month
high and local-currency debt advanced on speculation Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will seek tomorrow to damp
investor expectations for a reduction in stimulus.  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 12.6357 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:43 a.m. in Mexico City, the strongest level on a
closing basis since June 13. The peso extended its advance this
year to 1.7 percent, the only gain among 16 major dollar
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. Peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on securities maturing in 2042 down seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.81 percent.  The peso has rallied 2.1 percent since Bernanke said on
July 10 that the U.S. needs “highly accommodative monetary
policy for the foreseeable future.” The comments from the Fed
chairman, who is due to testify before Congress tomorrow, have
also pushed down yields on Mexican debt.  “They’re possibly anticipating that Bernanke’s discussion
tomorrow in Congress will ease market concern,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB
in Mexico City, said in a telephone interview.  The peso tumbled 2.6 percent on June 19, when Bernanke said
the U.S. central bank may taper stimulus if the  U.S. economy 
shows sustained improvement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
