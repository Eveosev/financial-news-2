Indian (SENSEX)  equities tumbled the most in
two weeks after the  Reserve Bank of India  raised two  interest
rates  yesterday to steady the rupee after its drop to a record.
Stocks most tied to economic growth led the declines.  The S&P BSE Sensex slid 0.9 percent to 19,851.23 at the
close in Mumbai, halting three days of gains.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) 
plunged the most since February 2011, leading its peers lower.
The S&P BSE Bankex, a measure of 13 lenders, sank 4.8 percent,
the most since July 2009. Carmaker  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  fell
2.4 percent, a record 11th day of losses.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the marginal standing
facility and the  bank rate  to 10.25 percent from 8.25 percent,
and said it will conduct open-market sales of government bonds
of $2 billion on July 18. The rupee fell to a record on July 8,
hurt by the slowest economic growth in a decade and a record
current-account gap. The RBI kept interest rates unchanged in
June, citing risks to inflation from a weak rupee.  “Softening of interest rates will get deferred by a few
months, which may throw a spanner in the works,” said  Gajendra Nagpal , chief executive officer at New Delhi-based Unicon
Financial Intermediaries Ltd. “In the short term, the growth
targets may have to be lowered.”  Morgan Stanley cut its year-end Sensex target 6.9 percent
to 21,500, saying the RBI’s decision raises risks to economic
expansion, cost of money and damps local liquidity.  Depositary Receipts  The Bank of New York Mellon India ADR Index fell 1.5
percent, the most in three weeks, to 1,005.49 as of 11:50 a.m.
in New York. American depositary receipts of Wipro Ltd. slipped
0.3 percent to $7.94. Infosys Ltd. ADRs added 0.4 percent to
$46.46 as  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  fell 0.9 percent to $24.26, leaving
the ADRs at a 2 percent discount to the underlying shares.  ICICI Bank, the nation’s second-biggest lender by market
value, tumbled 5.4 percent to 1,003.45 rupees, the most since
Feb. 24, 2011.  State Bank of India Ltd. , the largest by assets,
lost 4.4 percent to 1,827.65 rupees, the lowest close since Jan.
16.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the biggest lender by value, dropped 2.4
percent to 678.7 rupees.  Mortgage lender  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC)  slumped
3.8 percent to 816.05 rupees. The S&P BSE Bankex plunged the
most among the 13 sector indexes compiled by the BSE Ltd.  Some company loans may turn bad faster than expected after
the RBI’s moves, hurting banks with high loan-deposit ratios,
Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by Ashish Gupta wrote in a
report today.  IndusInd Bank Ltd. (IIB)  and  Yes Bank Ltd. (YES) , which are
not part of the Sensex, will be the worst affected, they wrote.  “Lenders will now have to raise deposit rates or borrow
funds from money markets at higher rates,” Vishal Narnolia, a
Mumbai-based banking analyst with SMC Global Securities Ltd.,
said by telephone. “The higher cost of funds cannot be fully
passed on, as lending growth is already at a three-year low.”  Auto Sales  Credit Suisse cut IndusInd Bank’s share-price estimate 11
percent to 416 rupees. The stock plunged 7.9 percent to 466.40
rupees, the sharpest fall since July 2009.  Maruti Suzuki retreated 2.4 percent to 1,411.25 rupees, a
three-month low.  Hero MotoCorp Ltd. (HMCL) , the biggest two-wheeler
maker, lost 1.9 percent to 1,692.35 rupees.  Mahindra & Mahindra
Ltd. (MM)  slid 1.6 percent to 913.5 rupees. High interest rates can
reduce automobile sales in a country where almost 80 percent of
vehicle purchases are funded through loans.  The rupee gained 1 percent to 59.315 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close. The currency, which touched a record low of 61.2125
on July 8 after the U.S. signaled it may reduce stimulus this
year, climbed as high as 59.1250, the highest level since July
1. The yield on 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 soared 52 basis
points to 8.2 percent, the most since January 2009.  Rate Outlook  RBI Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  kept the repurchase rate, the
policy benchmark, at 7.25 percent in June, ending a run of three
cuts. Yesterday’s steps “should not be read as a prelude to any
policy rate changes,” Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
told reporters in Jaipur today. “These measures in no way
affect our commitment to growth. Measures are taken to quell
excessive speculation and reduce volatility and stabilize the
rupee.” The policy next review is on July 30.  Cigarette maker ITC surged 2.1 percent to 360.05 rupees, an
all-time high. Shares of  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR)  and  Sun
Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (SUNP)  increased to 623.1 rupees and
1,119.5 rupees, both records. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
climbed 0.5 percent to 1,649.35 rupees, a life-time high.  “Markets are seeing value in companies that are cash-rich
and have low debt on their books as they will be least impacted
by the tightening measures,” Unicon’s Nagpal said.  ITC (ITC)  had a total debt of 1.02 billion rupees, Sun Pharma
1.98 billion rupees, Tata Consultancy 3.32 billion rupees and
Hindustan Unilever 247.4 million rupees as of March 31, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a median 195
billion rupees for the 30 Sensex companies, the data show.  Index Gain  The Sensex has gained 2.2 percent this year and  trades  at
13.3 times projected 12-month earnings. That compares with the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10 times.  Global investors  sold $29.5 million of domestic shares on
July 15, paring this year’s inflows to $12.4 billion, data from
the market regulator show. They sold $1.8 billion in June, the
most since August 2011, the data show.  The CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India
lost 1.3 percent to 5,955.25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
