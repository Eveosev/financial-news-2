The European Union will restrict
subsidies and grants to Israeli organizations operating in
territories occupied by Israel, the European Commission said.  The commission said it will soon publish “guidelines”
that make good on a December 2012 pledge to deny EU funding to
Israeli organizations in the  West Bank ,  Gaza Strip  and Golan
Heights.  “All Israeli entities whose place of establishment is
within the green line will be considered eligible,” EU
spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told reporters in Brussels today.
The green line refers to Israel’s pre-1967 borders.  The guidelines will cover central EU funding, not contracts
between individual European governments and Israel, Kocijancic
said. She said the result could be funding restrictions in “a
very small number of cases.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
