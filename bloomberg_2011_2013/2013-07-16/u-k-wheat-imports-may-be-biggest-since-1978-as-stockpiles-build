The U.K. is on pace to import the
most wheat since 1978 as buyers increase stockpiles on concern
this year’s harvest will be delayed, according to the
Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board.  Inbound shipments were 2.68 million metric tons from the
last marketing year’s start on July 1, 2012, through May,
according to customs  data  distributed today by the Kenilworth,
England-based AHDB. Purchases tripled from the same period in
the previous season and exceeded the government’s 2.54 million-ton forecast for the full 2012-13 crop year, even before figures
for the final month of June are reported.  The U.K. wheat crop’s development is 10 to 14 days later
than usual after fields received too much rain and temperatures
were below average early in the season, said  Charlotte  Garbutt,
a senior analyst at the AHDB. The nation probably was a net
importer of the grain in 2012-13 for the first time in 11 years
after the second-wettest year on record cut the previous harvest
by 13 percent, government data show. The U.K. may be a net
importer again in 2013-14, Garbutt said.  “Last year we had a very low stock situation, so with the
prospect of a late harvest, buyers may be carrying bigger stocks
because the market is more nervous about running out,” she said
by telephone. “U.K. processors have become more accustomed now
to using imported products, so it will take them some time to
switch back to U.K. crops if U.K. crop quality performs.”  Exports Plunge  Purchases in the first 11 months of 2012-13 were the
largest since 1978, when imports were about 3.1 million tons,
Garbutt said. Germany, France and  Canada  have been the biggest
suppliers. U.K. wheat exports in the season’s first 11 months
plunged more than 70 percent to 666,864 tons from 2.48 million
tons a year earlier, customs data show.  The U.K.’s wheat surplus, including domestic stockpiles and
grain left over for export at the end of 2012-13, was estimated
at 1.29 million tons, according to Department for Environment,
Food & Rural Affairs figures distributed by the AHDB on May 23.
That was 34 percent higher than the agency’s March forecast,
while below the 2011-12 surplus at 2.64 million tons, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
