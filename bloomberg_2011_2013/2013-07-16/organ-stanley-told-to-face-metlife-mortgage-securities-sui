Morgan Stanley (MS)  was ordered by a New
York judge to face a suit by MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life

 MetLife’s (MET)  claims of fraud, fraudulent inducement and aiding and
abetting fraud. The July 8 ruling was made public today.  MetLife, based in New York, sued Morgan Stanley in April
2012, accusing the investment bank of fraud and other claims
involving in residential mortgage-backed securities purchased in
nine offerings in 2006 and 2007.  Morgan Stanley didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
