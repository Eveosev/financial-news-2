Treasury  10-year note yields  fell to
a one-week low amid speculation Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke will seek to damp investor expectations of a reduction
in stimulus when he speaks to Congress tomorrow.  Treasuries pared gains as the cost of living in the U.S.
rose in June by the most in four months as gasoline prices
increased. Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross , who
added to holdings of U.S. government debt in his flagship fund
in June while betting incorrectly on gains in inflation-indexed
securities in the first half of 2013, posted on Twitter that
“Higher #CPI, more money for TIPS holders!, PIMCO included.”  “The market is anticipating a dovish, defensive
presentation -- and if it doesn’t get enough of that, they may
see it as hawkish,” Larry Milstein, managing director in New
York of government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., said
of Bernanke’s two days of testimony in Washington. “Inflation
is a non-issue and last week he seemed to be more concerned
about deflation than inflation. He’s going to lean to the dovish
side. The market is already pricing that in.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  dropped one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2.53 percent as of 5 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It reached 2.51
percent, the lowest level since July 5. The price of the 1.75
percent security maturing in May 2023 gained 1/32, or $0.31 per
$1,000 face amount, to 93 7/32.  Yields on the 10-year note rose to 2.75 percent on July 8,
the highest since August 2011, from a 2013 low of 1.61 percent
on May 1. They remain below the  five-year average  of 2.74
percent.  Term Premium  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was at 88, the lowest
level since June 19. The figure is down from 117.89 on July 5,
the highest since December 2010. The one-year average is 64.5.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, rose 35 percent to $254.7
billion from $189 billion yesterday. The 2013 average is $320
billion.  The  term premium , which measures the risk of holding
longer-dated bonds by incorporating investors’ outlook for
inflation and growth, was at 0.25 percent after touching 0.46
percent on July 5. The figure averaged 0.40 percent in the
decade before the 2007 financial crisis. A positive number means
investors are demanding compensation to own the securities. A
negative number means the securities are overvalued.  TIPS Returns  The 10-year yield’s 14-day  relative strength index  fell to
57.5 after rising to 77 on July 5, above the 70 level some
traders see as a sign that a reversal is imminent.  As of yesterday, investors in U.S. government securities
linked to consumer-price gains have lost 7.7 percent this year,
headed for the first annual decline since 2008, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index figures showed. Conventional Treasuries fell
2.7 percent over the same period.  The  difference  in yield between 10-year notes and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a measure of
trader expectations for inflation over the life of the debt
called the break-even rate, was at 2.12 percentage points, set
for the highest close since June 11. That compares with an
average of 2.37 percentage points in the past year.  The Fed’s price indicator for the period from 2018 to 2023,
known as the  five-year five-year  forward break-even rate, fell
to a two-week low of 2.41 percent as of July 11.  ‘Fairly Strong’  The consumer-price index increased 0.5 percent after a 0.1
percent gain the prior month, a Labor Department report showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
called for a 0.3 percent rise. Overall consumer prices increased
1.8 percent in the 12 months ended in June, more than projected
and after a 1.4 percent year-over-year gain the prior month. The
core measure, which excludes food and fuel, climbed 0.2 percent
from May.  The report “looks fairly strong -- it bodes well for the
inflation side of the story,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP Paribas SA, one of 21 primary
dealers obligated to trade with the Fed. “Break-evens are a
good buy at this point.”  Bernanke said on July 10 that the U.S. needs “highly
accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future,”
after last month saying the central bank may begin to slow its
$85 billion in monthly bond purchases this year and end them in
2014 if economic growth meets policy makers’ goals.  Foreign Purchasers  The U.S. central bank  purchased  $1.464 billion of
Treasuries maturing between February 2036 and February 2043
today as part of its bond-buying program.  Foreign purchases of U.S. long-term debt rose in May as
officials and private investors overseas purchased a net $11.3
billion of notes and bonds, compared with selling of $38.3
billion in April, the Treasury Department said in a statement
today in Washington.  China ’s holdings of Treasuries rose $25.2 billion to a
record $1.316 trillion, according to the Treasury.  Japan , the
second-largest holder, lowered its holdings by $1.7 billion to
$1.11 trillion.  “Tip of this mornin’s hat to TIPS,” Pimco’s Gross posted
today after data on his company’s  website  yesterday showed he
raised the proportion of U.S. government debt in the $268
billion Total Return Fund to 38 percent from 37 percent in May.
Newport Beach, California-based Pimco doesn’t comment directly
on monthly changes in holdings or specific types of securities
within a market sector such as the percentage of Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities in the U.S. grouping.  Fund Drops  Gross had been buying TIPS on a bet that money printing by
the world’s central banks would push up consumer prices, making
Treasuries the largest portion of the fund. When yields began to
rise in May on expectations the Fed would slow its bond-buying
program, inflation expectations didn’t, amplifying the losses on
inflation-hedged U.S. debt.  The  Total Return Fund (PTTRX) , the world’s largest mutual fund,
fell 4.7 percent in May and June, prompting $9.9 billion in
withdrawals last month, the most on record.  The Treasury is contacting primary dealers as it seeks ways
to support the TIPS market. The advice is being sought after
direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their
bids directly with the Treasury, bought 0.4 percent of debt
offered in a sale of 30-year TIPS in June. That was the least
since 2010, versus 14 percent in February and an average of 17.7
percent at the past nine auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
