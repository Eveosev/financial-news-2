U.K. Sinha, chairman of the
 Securities and Exchange Board of India , comments on the
definition of control in the regulator’s takeover code. Sinha
made the comments to reporters in New Delhi in response to a
question whether control was defined differently in rules
pertaining to foreign direct investment in the nation’s civil
aviation industry.  The  Foreign Investment Promotion Board  deferred a decision
on Etihad Airways PJSC’s plan to acquire a 24 percent stake in
Jet Airways ( India ) Ltd. as authorities sought more details from
Jet about its “effective control and ownership,” Economic
Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said June 14.  “Sebi’s position is very clear about any deal. I’m not
talking about any specific deal. If somebody has acquired stake
in a company beyond a certain threshold, then that acquirer has
to make an open offer.”  “Even if the acquirer has got less than threshold, but he
has got control over the company, then he has to make an open
offer. So, Sebi will be looking into any case when there is
suspicion or belief that control has been acquired.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
