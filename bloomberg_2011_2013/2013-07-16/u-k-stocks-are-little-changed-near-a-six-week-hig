U.K. stocks  were little changed near
a six-week high before U.S. economic data that may show
industrial production climbed last month.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  dropped 1.9 percent as Royal Bank of
Canada recommended investors sell the shares. Rio Tinto Group
gained 2 percent after the world’s second-largest mining company
reported iron-ore output that topped analyst estimates.
 Kingfisher Plc (KGF)  climbed 2.5 percent as Nomura Holdings Inc.
upgraded the European general retail industry.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index added 1.75 points, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 6,587.86 at 9:52 a.m. in London after
earlier falling and rising by as much as 0.3 percent. The FTSE
All-Share Index slipped less than 0.1 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index lost 0.4 percent.  “Investors are gearing up for a torrent of economic data
together with testimony to U.S. Congress by Federal Reserve
chief  Ben Bernanke  on Wednesday and Thursday,” said Ishaq Siddiqi, a market strategist at ETX Capital in London.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 1.1 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. industrial production advanced 0.3 percent in June
after stagnating in May, according to the median economist
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Eight companies in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  are
scheduled to report earnings today, including Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Johnson & Johnson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
