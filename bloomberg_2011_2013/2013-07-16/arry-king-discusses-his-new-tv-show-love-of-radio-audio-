Larry King , host of "Larry King Now"
on Hulu and Ora TV, discusses his new broadcasting ventures and 
his background in radio.  He predicted that as the television 
world changes, and network TV cedes its dominance to mobile and 
internet broadcasts, radio will never go away because there will
always be people driving in cars who can't watch screens.  King 
talks with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hays on Bloomberg Radio's "The 
Hays Advantage."    (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 11:55
