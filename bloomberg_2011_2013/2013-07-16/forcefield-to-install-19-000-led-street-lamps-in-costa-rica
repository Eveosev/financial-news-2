ForceField Energy Inc. (FNRG) , a U.S.
energy-efficiency company, plans to install 19,000 LED street
lamps for Costa Rica utility Empresa de Servicios Publicos de
Heredia.  ESPH, as the utility is known, will pay Forcefield more
than $21 million over 10 years, the  New York-based company said
today in a statement. The deal is expected to be closed and
financing secured by Sept. 30.  LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, may reduce energy
consumption by as much as 70 percent compared with conventional
lighting products, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
