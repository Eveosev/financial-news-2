President  Dilma Rousseff ’s approval
rating fell by the most since she took office after more than 1
million protesters took to the streets, according to an MDA poll
published by the National Transport Confederation.  Rousseff’s personal approval rating dropped to 49.3 percent
from 73.7 percent in the previous poll published on June 11. The
government’s approval rating dropped to 31.3 percent from 54.2
percent, according to the survey, which interviewed 2,002 people
from July 7 to 10. The margin of error is 2.2 percentage point.  Brazilians protested throughout  Brazil  last month against
bus fare increases, corruption, and poor public services. The
demonstrations came as economic growth slows and annual
inflation exceeds the official 6.5 percent target ceiling.
Today’s poll shows voters are less optimistic about the economy.  The percentage of those interviewed who expect unemployment
to improve fell to 32 percent from 39.6 percent. The percentage
who expect their income will rise fell to 29.6 percent from 35.8
percent.  Still, Rousseff remains the leading candidate for next
year’s election, according to the survey. The president would
garner 33.4 percent of the votes in the first round, ahead of
former Environment Minister  Marina Silva , supported by 20.7% of
those interviewed. Senator Aecio Neves of the PSDB opposition
party had 15.2 percent support, and Pernambuco state Governor
Eduardo Campos trailed with 7.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
