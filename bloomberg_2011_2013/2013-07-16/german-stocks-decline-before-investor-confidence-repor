German stocks  declined, snapping a
six-day winning streak, before data on investor confidence from
the ZEW Center for European Economic Research.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG slipped at
least 0.3 percent as European car sales fell to a two-decade low
in June.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Europe’s second-biggest airline,
climbed 1 percent as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded the
shares to neutral from sell.  The  DAX (DAX)  Index retreated 0.4 percent to 8,198.73 at 10:30
a.m. in Frankfurt. The measure had climbed 5.5 percent over the
previous six days as central banks signaled they won’t withdraw
stimulus measures imminently. The broader HDAX Index also
dropped 0.4 percent today.  German investor confidence increased in July, a report may
show at 11 a.m. in Mannheim, Germany. The ZEW index of investor
and analyst expectations rose to 40 from 38.5 in June,
economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  In the U.S., industrial production probably gained 0.3
percent in June after being little changed in the previous
month, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
before the release of data at 9:15 a.m.  New York  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
