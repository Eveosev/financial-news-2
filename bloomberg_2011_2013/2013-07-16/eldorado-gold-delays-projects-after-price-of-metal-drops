Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD) , a Canadian
producer of the metal with mines in China, Europe and Brazil,
will defer an expansion, slow development of projects and review
its dividend policy after  gold prices  dropped.  The changes will ensure Eldorado can develop its business
at a gold price of $1,250 an ounce for the foreseeable future,
the Vancouver-based company said today in a statement.  Miners such as  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest, are
cutting jobs and spending plans and writing down the value of
assets after the precious metal plunged 23 percent in the second
quarter in New York.  QMX Gold Corp. (QMX) , a Toronto-based producer,
said today it’s curtailing operations at the Lac Herbin mine in
 Quebec , while U.S. Silver & Gold Inc. said it will cut 126 staff
at its Galena complex in  Idaho .  Eldorado reduced its 2013 exploration budget 48 percent to
$51 million, while planned  capital spending  has been lowered 36
percent to $430 million. The company will defer an expansion of
its Kisladag mine in Turkey and now expects three new mines in
Greece and Romania will start production about a year later than
planned.  The board also will review the current dividend policy at
its next quarterly meeting “to ensure that the policy fits the
company’s current development spending plans,” the company
said. Eldorado’s dividend payments are linked to the number of
ounces it produces and the gold price. The company  paid  out
$93.1 million in dividends in 2012.  ‘Prudent’ Changes  Gold futures rose 0.5 percent to settle at $1,290.40 an
ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The price has
fallen 33 percent from a record $1,923.70 in September 2011.  The changes announced today by Eldorado are “prudent,”
said Steven Green, a Toronto-based analyst at TD Securities Inc.  “Eldorado is well-positioned to make a quick adjustment
like this without any writedowns since their reserves remain
calculated at $1,250 an ounce or lower versus many of their
peers who have gone to $1,400 an ounce or higher,” Green said
in a note.  Eldorado rose 5 percent to C$7.11 at the close in Toronto.
 The shares  have declined 45 percent this year.  The company said it expects to produce 745,000 ounces of
gold at cash costs of $520 per ounce, within a May forecast
range of 705,000 to 760,000 ounces at costs of $515 to $530.  To contact the reporter on this story:
