Zambia plans to build a $410 million
oil refinery as the inefficiency of the only existing facility
curbs growth in the economy of  Africa ’s biggest copper producer,
Mines and Energy Minister Christopher Yaluma said.  The state-owned Indeni refinery in Ndola, built in 1973 and
operating at about half its designed capacity of 1.1 million
metric tons a year, is “done away with, it’s finished,” he
said in an interview yesterday in Lusaka, the capital.  Fuel prices in Zambia are among the highest in sub-Saharan
Africa, according to the Energy Regulation Board. Investing in
refineries will help lower the cost of fuel, the regulator said
in a report last year. Zambian consumer prices accelerated to a
six-month high in June after the government removed fuel
subsidies. A liter of gasoline sells for 9.91 kwacha ($1.81).  The government would be “negligent” if it delayed
building a new refinery, Yaluma said.  “We will look at all possible financing models” for the
refinery, including public-private partnerships, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
