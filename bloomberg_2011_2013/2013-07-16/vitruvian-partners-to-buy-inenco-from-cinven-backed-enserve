Vitruvian Partners LLP, a U.K.
private-equity firm, agreed buy the energy division of EnServe
Group Ltd. for an undisclosed sum.  Vitruvian will buy Inenco Group Ltd., which provides energy
and risk-management services to clients of EnServe, which is
owned by buyout firm Cinven Partners LLP, according to a
statement today. EnServe, based in Borehamwood,  England , said
Robert W. Baird Ltd. acted as its financial adviser.  â€œFollowing the sale, we intend to invest in and remain
focused on driving forward the growth of our electricity, water
and analytics divisions, EnServe Chief Executive Officer David
Cruddace said in the statement.  Cinven purchased EnServe Group, then called Spice Plc, in
in December 2010 for 360 million pounds ($562 million). Inenco
has five offices and serves more than 9,000 corporate and public
sector customers, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
