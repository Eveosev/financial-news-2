Asian stocks climbed, with the
regional benchmark index rebounding from its lowest level in
more than a year, after French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said Greece will stay in the
euro zone.  Westpac Banking Corp. gained 2.6 percent in Sydney. Samsung
Electronics Co., which receives 20 percent of its revenue from
Europe, rose 2.4 percent in Seoul.  S-Oil Corp. (010950) , which refines
and sells petroleum, surged 12 percent. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. advanced 2.8 percent on higher chip prices.
 Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the biggest Hong Kong-listed clothier,
tumbled 18 percent after reporting profit plunged 98 percent.  “ Germany  and  France ’s commitment to continue supporting
Greece’s European Union membership diminishes the likelihood
that it will be allowed to default,” said  Tim Schroeders , who
helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
Melbourne. “If  Greece  avoids default, it lessens any flow-on
impact through the global banking system, which in turn is
positive for Asian stocks.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.4 percent to 117.91 as
of 5:51 p.m. in  Tokyo . All 10 industry groups on the measure
rose, with about seven stocks gaining for every three that
declined. The index yesterday fell to its lowest level since
Aug. 25 last year. Concern the global economy was slipping back
into a recession amid a worsening European-debt crisis and
slowing U.S. growth triggered a 17 percent plunge in the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index between this year’s high on May 2 and
yesterday.  Greece and Europe  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 1.8 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index rose 1.4 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 1.7 percent in Sydney. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index climbed 0.7 percent and China’s Shanghai Composite Index
fell 0.2 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.5
percent today. In  New York , the index advanced for a third day,
rising 1.4 percent yesterday. Sarkozy and Merkel are
“convinced” Greece will remain in the euro area, according to
a statement issued by Sarkozy after they spoke to Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  by telephone.  Stocks also rose after U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said “there is no chance that the major countries of
Europe will let their institutions be at risk in the eyes of the
market.” At a meeting with European Union finance ministers on
Sept. 16, Geithner will likely urge European governments to step
up their crisis-fighting efforts.  Banks Rise  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  gained 2.6 percent to A$19.41.
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest publicly
traded lender, rose 1.5 percent to 330 yen in Tokyo.  Financial shares provided the biggest support to the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index as a group, while consumer discretionary
stocks were the fourth-biggest boost.  Samsung Electronics rallied 2.4 percent to 771,000 won in
Seoul.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, gained
2.1 percent to 2,690 yen, the second-biggest boost to the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index. Honda Motor Co., which receives about 80
percent of its revenue from outside Japan, jumped 4 percent to
2,388 yen.  “We’re seeing some risk-on trading on hopes that the
European issue will be pushed further down the road,” said
Belinda Allen, senior analyst of investment markets research at
Colonial First State Global Asset Management in Sydney, which
oversees about $150 billion. “Despite the comments from the
French and German leaders, Europe still has a lot of issues to
work through that will impact markets over coming months.”  S-Oil, Elpida  S-Oil surged 11 percent to 121,500 won in Seoul on
speculation improved returns from processing crude into oil
products will boost earnings. Prices of paraxylene, a
petrochemical used in synthetic fibers, have also increased,
according to Cho Seung Yeon, an analyst at HMC Investment
Securities Co. The stock posted the biggest gain on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index.  Chipmaker  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665)  jumped 5 percent to 564 yen.
The company said it plans to shift some production from Japan to
Taiwan to cope with a stronger yen and an industry slump.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report today that the shift
overseas by Elpida may help cut a surplus in dynamic-random-
access-memory chips, which would be positive for the price of
the semiconductors.  Chipmakers Gain  Chipmakers boosted information technology stocks to the
biggest gain among the 10 industry groups on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index after DRAM prices jumped. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing advanced 2.8 percent to NT$69.1 in Taipei, and
 Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)  rose 6.3 percent to 21,100 won in
 Seoul . Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. surged 9
percent to 48.5 Hong Kong cents, the second-biggest increase on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  The price of DDR3 2-gigabit DRAM jumped 8.9 percent at

TrendForce Corp.’s DRAMExchange.  Among shares that fell, Esprit plunged 18 percent to
HK$15.08. Net income plunged to HK$79 million in the year
through June from HK$4.23 billion in the previous period. The
mean estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit
to slide to HK$3.14 billion.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 16 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 5.5 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and a 19 percent loss by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 11.9 for the S&P 500 and 9.4
times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
