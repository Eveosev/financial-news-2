Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s
biggest brokerage, may delay hiring plans that support its goal
of expanding in  Switzerland , said Felix Weber, head of the
company’s Swiss unit.  “We plan to continue growing the business in
Switzerland,” Weber said in an interview in Zurich. “Because
of the current market situation, hiring plans may be delayed,
but we will continue to make strategic hires.”  The Zurich-based unit, which according to Nomura is the
second-biggest participant by trading volume on the Swiss stock
exchange, boosted corporate-finance revenue by 20 percent last
year. The firm has a number of merger advisory opportunities in
the industrial and pharmaceutical industries, Weber said,
without giving further details.  Nomura is preparing to trim about 5 percent of jobs in
 Europe  to reduce costs, two people with knowledge of the matter
said on Sept. 13. The Tokyo-based company joins Bank of America
Corp., HSBC Holdings Plc and global rivals in trimming jobs as
faltering economic growth and Europe’s debt crisis threaten to
curb trading income and investment-banking revenue.  Nomura, which manages about 260 million Swiss francs ($297
million) for private clients in Switzerland, wants  wealth
management  to become a strategic growth area, Weber said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
