John Tavares, the  New York
Islanders ’ leading scorer each of his first two National Hockey
League seasons, signed a six-year contract extension.  Tavares, who turns 21 on Sept. 20, was selected by the
Islanders with the first pick in the 2009 NHL draft. He has 53
goals and 68 assists in 161 NHL games.  “He is a key component to the core of players we’ve
decided to build this team around and we couldn’t be happier to
ensure that he will be a New York Islander for years to come,”
General Manager Garth Snow said in a statement.  Tavares had 29 goals and 38 assists last season as the
Islanders went 30-39-13, the fourth-worst record in the NHL. The
