Canadian existing home sales fell
in August for a second month, the  Canadian Real Estate
Association  said, adding to evidence the country’s housing
market has slowed.  Seasonally adjusted home sales declined to 37,177 units
during the month, from 37,378 in July, the organization said in
 a statement  today. Purchases rose 15.8 percent from a year
earlier, up from a 12.3 percent year-over-year pace in July.  While Canada’s real estate market has been strong since
2009, with buyers taking advantage of historically low  interest
rates  and available credit from banks, the market slowed after
Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  tightened mortgage rules earlier
this year and rising prices made home purchases less affordable.  CREA forecast last month that sales will total 450,800 this
year, up 0.9 percent from 2010.  Canada  Mortgage & Housing Corp.,
a government agency, said Sept. 9 the pace of home construction
starts fell 9.7 percent in August.  The average home price in Canada rose 0.1 percent to
C$362,652 ($367,750) in August and is up 7.7 percent from a year
earlier, CREA said today.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said in June 15 speech
that housing prices in some parts of the country are reaching
“severely unaffordable” levels.  Existing-home sales rose 2.1 percent in August to 7,571
units in  Toronto , and gained 21 percent in Canada’s largest city
over the past year. Sales in the  Fraser Valley , the area east of
Vancouver, recorded a 36 percent gain in August from a year
earlier, after gaining 4.1 percent in August.  Sales  in  Vancouver , Canada’s second-biggest market, which
were down 2.5 percent in August, have increased 8.2 percent from
a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
