Oil erased declines in  New York  as
optimism that European leaders will keep Greece in the euro zone
countered a report that showed weaker U.S. fuel demand.  Crude for October delivery traded at $88.92 a barrel, up 1
cent, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 10:01 a.m. after earlier falling as much as 0.4 percent. The
contract yesterday slid $1.30, or 1.4 percent, to $88.91. Prices
are 17 percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for October was at $112.41, up 1 cent, on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract was at a premium of $23.49 to U.S. futures, compared
with a record $26.87 on Sept. 6.  U.S. gasoline supplies rose 1.94 million barrels last
week, the biggest gain since June, according to an Energy
Department report yesterday. Fuel use fell 3.8 percent and
refineries operated at 87 percent of capacity, down 2 percentage
points from the prior week.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said theyâ€™re convinced Greece will remain in the
euro area, according to a statement issued by Sarkozy yesterday
after they spoke to Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou by
telephone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
