Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a third
straight day against the dollar, as supply of the U.S. currency
slowed in West Africa’s largest economy after  Nigeria .  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.7 percent to 1.5733 per dollar by 2:03 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The cedi continued to weaken, due to complete lack of
dollar supply on the market,” Lourens Harmse, a Johannesburg-
based currency trader at Absa Bank Ltd., said by phone.
“There’s consistent strong demand from manufacturers and
importers onshore.”  The  Bank of Ghana  has held off on selling dollars for four
straight weeks, according to Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at
the local unit of Barclays Bank Plc. “The cedi will come under
pressure in the coming weeks if the central bank continues to
refrain from selling dollar,” he said by phone today. No one at
the central bank’s treasury department was available to comment,
according to a woman who answered the phone and declined to give
her name.  The cedi may weaken to “around 1.5750 per dollar” if the
bank doesn’t sell any foreign currency, Harmse said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
