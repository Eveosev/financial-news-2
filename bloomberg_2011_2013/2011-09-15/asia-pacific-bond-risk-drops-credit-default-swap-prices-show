The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 2 basis points to 173 basis
points as of 8:35 a.m. in Beijing, Credit Agricole CIB prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 4 basis points to 158
as of 9:40 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 3.5 basis points
to 183.5 basis points as of 10:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Credit Agricole.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  --  Henry Sanderson . Editor: Edward Johnson  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
