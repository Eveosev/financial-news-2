The ice cap covering the  Arctic
Ocean  shrank to its second-smallest size since a satellite
survey of the region began in 1979, a U.S. monitoring agency
said.  The ice, which melts every summer before cold weather makes
it expand again, was smallest this year on Sept. 9, covering
4.33 million square kilometers (1.67 million square miles), the
U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center said today in a
 statement . In 2007 it shrank to 4.17 million square kilometers,
compared with an average area of 6.29 million square kilometers
from 1979 to 2010.  The level of Arctic ice melt is an indicator that global
temperatures are rising, said Walt Meier, a research scientist
at the Boulder, Colorado-based center. The Arctic ice cap has
reached its five smallest extents in each of the past five
years, he said.  “The sea ice is almost acting like an early warning
system” for  climate change , he said. “It’s one of the more
visible indicators of a warming world.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
