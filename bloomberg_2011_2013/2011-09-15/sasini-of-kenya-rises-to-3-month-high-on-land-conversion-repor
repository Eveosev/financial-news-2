Sasini Ltd. (STCL)  jumped to a three-month
high after Business Daily reported the Kenyan tea and coffee
producer plans to convert farmland to real estate.  The stock rallied 5.2 percent to 12.05 shillings as of the
3 p.m. close in the capital Nairobi, the strongest level since
June 13.  Sasini received local-government approval to convert 1,000
acres (404 hectares) of land under coffee farming to real
estate, Business Daily reported yesterday. The company won’t
stop farming in the immediate future, in order to take advantage
of high commodity prices on international markets, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said, citing Chief Executive Officer Caesar
Mwangi.  “All the agricultural companies will maximize  shareholder
value  by going into real estate because the land acquisition
prices in their balance sheets are held at historical costs,”
 Aly-Khan Satchu , chief executive officer of Rich Management, a
Nairobi-based  investment adviser  to high-net-worth individuals,
said in a phone interview today. “You have got balance sheets
that are not reflecting the true net asset value.”  The tea and coffee grower has a market value of 2.8 billion
shillings ($30 million). The value of the land it owns could be
about 20 billion shillings, Satchu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
