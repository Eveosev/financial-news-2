Peru ’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars fell to a one-week low on optimism international policy
makers are containing Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, boosting
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 220 at 2:35 p.m. New York time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  European Central Bank  said it coordinated with other
central banks in Europe, the U.S. and Japan to extend three-
month loans to euro-area lenders in an effort to ensure they
have enough cash for the rest of the year.  The ECB’s announcement “ helped calm international
markets,” said Augusto Saldarriaga, head of analysis at Banco
Internacional del Peru in  Lima . “It’s only a palliative because
the situation in Europe and the U.S. depends on political action
more than economic decisions.”  Peru’s sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7300 per  U.S.
dollar , from 2.7315 yesterday.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 climbed six basis points to
5.57 percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
