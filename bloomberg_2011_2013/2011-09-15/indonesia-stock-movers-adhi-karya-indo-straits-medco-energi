Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  fell 24.70 points, or 0.7
percent to 3,774.33, dropping for a fifth straight day.  Energy companies: PT Bumi Resources (BUMI IJ),  Asia ’s
biggest exporter of power-station coal, declined 1 percent to
2,600 rupiah and PT Energi Mega Persada (ENRG IJ), the nation’s
second-biggest listed oil company, declined 3.3 percent to 178
rupiah.  Crude oil for October delivery fell as much as 1 percent to
$88.01 a barrel in after-hours trading in  New York , extending
yesterday’s 1.4 percent slide. A lower oil price reduces the
appeal of alternative fuels such as coal.  PT Adhi Karya (ADHI IJ), a state-owned construction company,
jumped 7.3 percent to 590 rupiah, the most since Dec. 14. Adhi
Karya and its partner, Goldstar Co. Ltd., won a tender from PT
Pertamina to build a residual fluid catalytic cracker plant
valued at $1.5 billion, Mochamad Harun, a spokesman at Pertamina,
said, confirming a report today by Investor Daily  Indonesia .  PT Bank Danamon Indonesia (BDMN IJ), which is owned by
 Singapore ’s Temasek Holdings Pte and Deutsche Bank AG, fell 4.8
percent to 4,950 rupiah. Danamon declined as overseas investors
realized gains in the stock, according to Michael Handisurya, an
analyst at PT Valbury Asia Securities in Jakarta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
