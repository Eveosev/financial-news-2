Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) ,
 India ’s largest mortgage lender, is likely to pay 4.6 billion
rupees as advance tax for the three months ending Sept. 30,
compared with 4.2 billion rupees a year earlier, an official in
Mumbai’s tax department said.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , owner of the Jaguar and Land Rover
brands, may pay 900 million rupees in taxes, little changed from
a year ago, the official said, declining to be identified
because of department rules.  Advance tax payments are monitored by investors as an
indicator of profitability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
