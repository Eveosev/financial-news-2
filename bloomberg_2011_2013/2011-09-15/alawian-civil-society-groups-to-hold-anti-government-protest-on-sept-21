Malawian civil-society groups plan
to hold anti-government protests on Sept. 21 after United
Nations-backed talks failed to resolve differences with
President Bingu wa Mutharika’s administration, the groups said.  “We have seen the president promoting a culture of
intimidation and direct attacks at civil society, an element
that greatly undermines the essence of the dialog in question,”
the Blantyre-based Council for Non-Governmental Organizations
said in an e-mailed statement.  Clashes with police during protests in the southern African
nation in July led to the deaths of 19 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
