The  U.S. Senate  approved a $6.9
billion plan to provide disaster aid to victims of  Hurricane
Irene , the mid-Atlantic earthquake, and wildfires and tornadoes
in the nation’s midsection.  The vote was 62-37. House Republicans plan next week to
take up a competing plan to provide $3.7 billion in assistance.  Republicans, citing budget constraints, want the costs
partially offset with a $1 billion cut to an Energy Department
loan program subsidizing the development of more fuel-efficient
automobiles. Republicans say they plan to approve more aid after
they have time to examine the administration’s funding requests.  Democrats are balking at demands for offsetting savings,
saying disaster aid has traditionally been considered an
emergency that can be financed with borrowed money. Senator
 Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat, said beginning to require
offsets will make it harder for Congress to respond to
disasters.  The bill is H.J. Res. 66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
