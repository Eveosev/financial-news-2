General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
biggest maker of electricity-generating equipment, will add 1
megawatt of power capacity to Brazil’s largest solar plant, and
may eventually expand the facility to 50 megawatts.  GE will erect panels next to  MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) ’s facility in
the northeastern city of Taua, GE said today in a joint
statement with the Brazilian energy company that’s controlled by
Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista. MPX’s existing 1-megawatt
plant comprises of 4,680 panels, enough to power about 1,500
households, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said.  MPX has secured federal and state licenses to expand the
project up to 5 megawatts.  “Working with GE, we plan to grow our business at this
plant to 50 megawatts,” Eduardo Karrer, the chief executive
officer of Rio De Janeiro-based MPX, said in the statement.  GE will use its own thin-film panels, inverters,
transformers and monitoring and control systems at the facility,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
