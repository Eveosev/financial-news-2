Turkeyâ€™s budget had a surplus of
2.8 billion liras in August, a decline of 11 percent from a year
earlier, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The budget excluding interest payments on debt had a
surplus of 8.4 billion liras last month, an annual increase of
36 percent, the ministry said on its website today.  The surplus in August partly offset a deficit of 3.5
billion liras posted in July, the data showed. The deficit in
July grew 72 percent from a year ago. The ex-interest  budget
surplus  was 114 million liras, narrowing by 96 percent from July
2010, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
