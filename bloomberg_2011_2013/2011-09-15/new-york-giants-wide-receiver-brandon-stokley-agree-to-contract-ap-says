The  New York Giants  signed free-
agent wide receiver Brandon Stokley, a 13-year veteran who won
Super Bowls with the Indianapolis Colts and Baltimore Ravens.  Stokley, 35, spent last season with the Seattle Seahawks,
catching 31 passes for 354 yards. He has 338 receptions for
4,673 yards and 34 touchdowns with the Colts, Ravens, Seahawks
and Denver Broncos in his National Football League career.  The Giants didnâ€™t disclose terms of the contract.  The Giants lost receiver Steve Smith as a free agent during
the offseason and  Hakeem Nicks  sustained a bone bruise in his
knee during a season-opening loss to the Washington Redskins.
Nicks said yesterday he expects to play against the  St. Louis
Rams  on Sept. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
