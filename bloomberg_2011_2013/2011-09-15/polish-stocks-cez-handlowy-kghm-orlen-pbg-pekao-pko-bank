Poland’s WIG20 Index rose 73.81, or
3.3 percent, to 2,283.99 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw, the
biggest gain in more than a week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, jumped
1.04 zloty, or 3.4 percent, to 31.4 zloty and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , the country’s second-largest, jumped 5.4 zloty, or 4.1
percent, to 136.1 zloty, rising for a third day. Bank Handlowy
SA (BHW PW), majority-owned by Citigroup Inc., soared 3.6 zloty,
or 6 percent, to 63.7 zloty.  Banks surged across Europe after the  European Central Bank 
said it will coordinate with the  Federal Reserve  and other
central banks to offer three separate three-month loans to
ensure euro-area banks have enough of the U.S. currency through
the end of the year.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper
producer, jumped 9.5 zloty, or 6.1 percent, to 166 zloty. Copper
for three-month delivery extended gains in London trading,
climbing $92.25, or 1.1 percent, to $8,722 a metric ton.  PBG SA (PBG)  , Poland’s third-largest builder, rose 0.6
zloty, or 0.9 percent, to 65.5 zloty, rising for the first time
in 12 days. Its 14-day relative strength index, which shows how
rapidly prices advanced or dropped during a specified time
period, was at 10.8 yesterday. A reading of 30 or below signals
to some investors that shares are set to rise.  Separately, PBG is in a group of companies shortlisted by
the city of Poznan to build and manage $325 million incinerator
project, the Polish western municipality said on its website.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, gained
1.8 zloty, or 5.2 percent, to 37.54 zloty, rising for a second
time this week as Wood & Co. raised its recommendation for
 Poland ’s biggest oil company to “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
