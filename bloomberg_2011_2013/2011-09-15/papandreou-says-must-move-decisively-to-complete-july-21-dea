Greek Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  said a positive fifth review from the  International
Monetary Fund , European Central Bank and European Commission,
the so-called troika, will pave the way for implementation of
the July 21 European Union summit decisions.  “With the completion of a positive review from the troika
Greece will undoubtedly be supported in accordance with July’s
decisions,” Papandreou said in an e-mailed transcript of a
speech made to his Cabinet today. “This review will show that
we have done what needed doing.”  Papandreou said there is work ahead and Greece isn’t far
from achieving its target for a primary surplus next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
