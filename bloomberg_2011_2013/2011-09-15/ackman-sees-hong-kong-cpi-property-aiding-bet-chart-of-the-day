“Reducing inflation and the risk
of asset bubbles” would be enough to justify a revaluation of
Hong Kong’s currency, according to  William Ackman , founder of
the Pershing Square Capital Management LP hedge fund.  Ackman’s made the comment during a presentation two days
ago, in which he disclosed purchases of options that will rise
in value if the  Hong Kong dollar  appreciates against its U.S.
counterpart.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays two indexes that were part of
the presentation, made at an investor conference in  New York  and
posted yesterday on the Business Insider website. Both have
increased this year to the highest levels since Hong Kong was
handed over to China 14 years ago, as the chart shows.  Hong Kong’s consumer price index, one of the indicators,
rose 7.9 percent in July from a year earlier. The increase was
the biggest since 1995 and amounted to 5.8 percent after
adjusting for a public-housing subsidy available last year.  The other index tracks real-estate prices and is compiled
by Centaline Property Agency Ltd., one of Hong Kong’s largest
brokers. The Centa-City Leading Index, based on prices of the
firm’s deals, is 3.2 percent below a record set in June.  Ackman predicted the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will
increase the currency’s peg to HK$6 to the  U.S. dollar  from
HK$7.80, maintained since 1983, before shifting the peg to the
Chinese yuan in three to six years. The de facto central bank
“has no plan or intention to change the system,” according to
its e-mailed reply to questions from Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
