Rents for capesize ships that haul
 iron ore  fell, paring a 22 percent climb over the last five
sessions, as contracts used to bet on or hedge future hire costs
implied a 37 percent plunge in the fourth quarter.  Capesize rates dropped 2.7 percent to $28,039 a day,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange, which assesses
freight costs on more than 50 international maritime routes. The
forward contracts, sometimes called the paper market in the
industry, indicated fourth-quarter rents of $17,785, according
to data from Clarkson Securities Ltd.  “It’s a paper-driven negativity, without any obvious major
factor in the physical market,” Alex Gray, chief executive
officer of the unit of Clarkson Plc, the world’s biggest
shipbroker, said today by phone.  The Baltic Dry Index, a wider measure of commodity-shipping
costs, dropped 1 percent to 1,907, according to the exchange.
Capesizes are the biggest vessels tracked by the gauge.  Daily rents for panamax ships, the largest that can
navigate the Panama Canal, increased 0.7 percent to $14,033.
That’s the highest level since June 24, according to the
exchange. Supramax vessels advanced 0.8 percent to $15,038 and
handysizes declined 1.2 percent to $10,117.  The global fleet of dry-bulk vessels will expand by 13
percent in 2011, more than triple a 4 percent gain in commodity
shipping, according to estimates from Clarkson Research Services
Ltd., also a unit of Clarkson Plc. The ships carry cargoes such
as coal and grains in addition to iron ore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
