Rebel forces in  Libya  said today
they captured Sirte,  Muammar Qaddafi ’s birthplace and one of the
last holdouts of his loyalist troops.  After an all day battle, the rebels announced they

to Qaddafi, including part of a brigade commanded by Qaddafi’s
son Khamis, were trapped in beachfront villas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
