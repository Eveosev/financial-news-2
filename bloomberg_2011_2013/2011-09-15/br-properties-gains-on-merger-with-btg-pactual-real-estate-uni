BR Properties SA (BRPR3)  rose for the first
time in five sessions after the Brazilian property developer and
Banco BTG Pactual SA, whose chief executive officer is
billionaire  Andre Esteves , agreed to merge their real-estate
assets in an all-share transaction.  BR Properties increased 1.5 percent to 17.51 reais at the
close of Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time after
earlier jumping as much as 6.7 percent, the most intraday since
May 2010. The benchmark Bovespa index climbed 0.2 percent.  The company will incorporate the real estate assets of BTG
Pactual and the bank’s WTorre Properties SA unit, BTG Pactual
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. In the new merged
company, BR Properties shareholders will have 58.1 percent of
the total capital, while BTG Pactual will have 30.8 percent,
according to the statement.  “We believe the deal is accretive for BR Properties since
it consolidates the company as the market leader with a high-
quality portfolio and managed by a very results-focused group,”
Credit Suisse Group AG’s analysts including Guilherme Rocha said
in a research note e-mailed to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
