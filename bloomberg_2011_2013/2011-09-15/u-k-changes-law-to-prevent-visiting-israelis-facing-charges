The U.K. amended the law around
private prosecutions to prevent visiting dignitaries from facing
arrest on  war crimes  or torture charges.  In recent years, Israeli politicians in particular have
been told that if they come to Britain they face arrest on
charges brought by human-rights groups. In 2009,  Tzipi Livni ,
leader of the opposition Kadima party, decided against visiting
the U.K. after a warrant was issued for her arrest by lawyers
acting for Palestinians.  Under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act,
passed by Parliament yesterday, private prosecutions for
“universal jurisdiction” offences will have to be approved by
the Director of Public Prosecutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
