Spain ’s government aims to raise
2.16 billion euros ($2.98 billion) this year and next from a
 wealth tax  it will revive tomorrow as a temporary measure to
help narrow the budget deficit.  The levy, which was scrapped in 2008, will apply to assets
over 700,000 euros, and will probably affect 160,000 taxpayers,
Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said in Madrid today.  Spain’s Socialist government, which has suffered nationwide
protests against austerity measures including wage cuts, faces
general elections on Nov. 20 that polls indicate it will lose.
Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the Socialists’ candidate, said this
week he had asked Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to
bring back the wealth tax.  The government is following similar steps by France and
 Italy . French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who also faces
elections in 2012, last month introduced a 3 percent surcharge
on those earning more than 500,000 euros as well as higher taxes
on capital gains. Italy, struggling to tame the region’s second-
largest debt burden, is set to apply a levy on incomes in excess
of 300,000 euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
