Israeli inflation expectations
plunged to the lowest level in more than 15 months before a
report that economists said will show consumer prices slowed in
August as social protests led to a decline in prices.  The two-year breakeven rate, reflecting market expectations
for inflation over the time period, fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 177 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel
Aviv , the lowest since at least June 2010. That’s down from this
year’s high of 357 basis points in May and implies an average
annual inflation rate of 1.77 percent. Annual inflation likely
slowed to 3.2 percent in August from 3.4 percent in July,
according to the median estimate of 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The data will be released at 6:30 p.m.  “Inflation in August is expected to be lower as consumer
protests brought down prices, in particular food costs, and
moderated consumption,” Alex Zabezhinsky, chief economist at DS
Securities & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by telephone.
“Investors are hesitant to take positions as the August index
might surprise depending on the extent of the impact of the
protests.”  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  pledged Sept. 4 to help
ease living costs after more than 400,000 people took to the
streets. Netanyahu said he will act on recommendations from a
panel headed by Tel Aviv University economist Manuel Trajtenberg
that was appointed as protests that began over the rising cost
of cottage cheese expanded. The committee’s recommendations,
aimed at providing cheaper housing and bringing down prices for
food, child care and transportation, are due this month.  Inflation Expectations  Inflation has exceeded the government’s 1 percent to 3
percent target range since the beginning of the year. The yield
on the CPI-linked bond due June 2013 declined three basis points
to 1.11 percent.  Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, were at 2.94 percent
today compared with 3.23 percent on Aug. 15, the day July’s
consumer-price data was released. Bank of Israel Governor
 Stanley Fischer  last month held the benchmark  interest rate  at
3.25 percent for a third month after raising it 10 times in the
past two years.  The shekel strengthened 1.2 percent against the dollar to
3.6674 at 5:06 p.m. after reaching 3.6574 as the  European
Central Bank  said it will lend dollars to euro-area banks in a
series of three-month loans to ensure they have enough of the
U.S. currency through the end of the year.  The yields on the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit maturing in
January 2020 and the 5.5 percent note due in January 2022
increased two basis points to 4.58 percent and 4.78 percent,
respectively.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, advanced for a third day,
increasing 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
