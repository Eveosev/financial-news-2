European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said there are no signs at the moment 
that  Greece  won’t be able to pay its debt.  As long as there are no indications from observers that
Greece’s debt load has become unsustainable, there is no reason
to doubt that the country can repay its debt, Stark said in
Vienna today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
