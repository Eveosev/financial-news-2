Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) , the largest
maker of analog chips, boosted its quarterly dividend 31 percent
as it sells technologies that generate more cash.  The dividend rises to 17 cents a share from 13 cents and
will be payable Nov. 21 to stockholders of record as of Oct. 31,
the Dallas-based company said today in a statement.  Texas Instruments is moving to a greater percentage of
analog and embedded processing technologies, which generate
higher returns and  cash flow , after saying earlier this month
that a weakening economy is weighing on demand for its current
products. The company gets most of its revenue from analog
chips, semiconductors that are key components in everything from
medical devices to e-book readers.  “This dividend increase reflects the strength of our
strategy, our confidence in our future and our commitment to
shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer  Rich Templeton  said in
the statement. The company said it has boosted the payout for
eight consecutive years.  The company said this month that third-quarter sales may
fall short of earlier forecasts. Profit in the quarter will be
56 cents to 60 cents a share on revenue of $3.23 billion to
$3.37 billion, according to its Sept. 8 outlook. Analysts
on average had estimated profit of 60 cents and sales of
$3.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Texas Instruments rose 44 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $27.71
at 4:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have
declined 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
