The  Philippines  may raise an
additional 2.3 billion pesos to 3.3 billion pesos annually by
collecting value-added tax on toll roads starting Oct. 1, Bureau
of Internal Revenue Commissioner  Kim Henares  said.  “It will not have that great an impact” to the public,
Henares told reporters today in Manila. The bureau, which
collects more than 60 percent of the government’s annual
earnings, is “working hard” to meet its 940 billion pesos
target this year and will report August performance tomorrow,
Henares said. It filed tax complaints against two doctors and
two lawyers today before the justice department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
