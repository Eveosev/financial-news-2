Crude oil from  Qatar , which sold
all its supply to  Asia  last year, rose to the highest level
against its benchmark price since 2007 as refiners bought
cargoes to capitalize on increased processing profits.  Qatar Marine jumped 27 cents to a premium of 88 cents a
barrel over its official selling price, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest since October 2007.
Murban from Abu Dhabi’s National Oil Co. climbed 5 cents to a
premium of 58 cents a barrel, the biggest premium since May 21,
Bloomberg data showed.  Cargoes of Qatar Marine have sold out as refiners bought up
supplies, said three traders who declined to be identified
because they aren’t authorized to speak with the media. Refiners
in  Japan  are seeking to maximize their output of gasoil and
kerosene ahead of the winter heating season. Qatar Marine yields
about 14 percent of kerosene after basic processing, above the
9.6 percent from Arab Light, a typical Middle East grade.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai, a measure of profitability,
narrowed 9 cents today to $16.73 a barrel, according to data
from London-based brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd. That’s up from
$11.89 a year ago.  Oman crude for immediate loading rose $1.99, or 1.9
percent, to $108.46 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in November climbed 1.9 percent to $107.90. Murban
rose 1.9 percent to $112.51.  Dubai crude for November was at a premium of $1.52 a barrel
above supplies loading in January, a market structure known as
backwardation, which suggests demand for oil is higher for
prompt cargoes. That’s up from $1.35 yesterday.  Oman futures for November delivery rose $2.05 to $108.90 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 6:07 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,776 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$107.24 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The November Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
widened 22 cents to $6.77 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The exchange for swaps for December gained 10 cents to $4.62.  To contact the reporter on this story:
