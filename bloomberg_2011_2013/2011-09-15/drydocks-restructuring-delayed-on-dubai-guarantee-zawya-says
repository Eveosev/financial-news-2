Drydocks World LLC’s restructuring
of $2.2 billion in debt has been delayed because Dubai’s
government refused to provide financial guarantees for new
loans, Zawya Dow Jones reported, citing three unidentified
bankers familiar with the matter.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ,  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY) ,  ING Groep NV (INGA) , DSB Groep NV and  Mashreqbank PSC (MASQ)  are
members of a coordinating committee holding talks on the loans,
the news agency reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
