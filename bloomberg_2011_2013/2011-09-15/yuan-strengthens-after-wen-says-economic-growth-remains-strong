China ’s yuan strengthened for a
second day after Premier Wen Jiabao said the country’s economic
growth remains strong, fanning speculation the government will
favor currency gains to stem inflation.  Asia ’s largest economy faces relatively high inflationary
pressure, Wen said in a webcast by the official Xinhua News
Agency yesterday. He also at a forum yesterday that China would
achieve “longer term, better quality” economic expansion and
this would be the country’s contribution to sustainable global
growth. Wen’s comments sent a “very clear” message that China
will not ease its monetary stance, Dong Tao, an analyst at
Credit Suisse AG in Hong Kong, wrote in a report dated today.  “China’s economic outlook is rosier compared with
developed countries,” said Kenix Lai, a senior market analyst
at Bank of East Asia Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “That helps stimulate
demand for the currency. Wen’s comments also confirmed that
China continues to focus on curbing inflation and yuan
appreciation is one of the tools to achieve that.”  The yuan strengthened 0.07 percent to close at 6.3920 per
dollar in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The People’s Bank of China set the daily  reference
rate  0.1 percent stronger at 6.3878. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 0.5 percent on either side of that rate.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.12 percent
to 6.3860 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards
climbed 0.09 percent to 6.3360, a 0.9 percent premium to the
onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
