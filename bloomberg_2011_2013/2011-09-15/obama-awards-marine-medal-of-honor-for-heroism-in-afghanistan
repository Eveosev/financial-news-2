President  Barack Obama  awarded the
nation’s highest military honor to a Marine who risked his life
to save 36 others during a firefight in  Afghanistan .  Dakota Meyer, 23, a Kentucky native and former Marine
sergeant, was awarded the nation’s highest military decoration
for his service in the Kunar province of Afghanistan on Sept. 8,
2009. He is the third living recipient of the medal from the
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Under enemy fire, Meyer went looking for missing U.S.
troops caught in an ambush in 2009. He is credited with saving
American and Afghan troops who had been pinned down and
retrieving the bodies of those killed.  Obama, in the medal ceremony today in the East Room of the
White House, said it was fitting to honor Meyer just days after
the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks
that prompted the U.S. war in Afghanistan. In Meyer, Obama said,
“we see the best of a generation that has served with
distinction through a decade of war.”  Meyer and the president also drank a beer together
yesterday in the White House  Rose Garden  at Meyer’s request. The
photo was distributed by the White House.  In his remarks today, Obama said he was aware that Meyer
had struggled with what happened that day and has said he felt
he had failed because he couldn’t bring some of his fellow
Marines home alive. “As your commander in chief and on behalf
of everyone here today and all Americans I want you to know it’s
quite the opposite,” Obama said. “You did your duty, above and
beyond.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
