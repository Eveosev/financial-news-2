German exports rose a nominal 14.7
percent in the first half of 2011 from the same period a year
earlier, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today.  The value of exports increased to 525.6 billion euros
($724.9 billion) from 458.3 billion euros in the first six
months of 2010, the office said in a faxed statement. Imports
outpaced exports, gaining 16.4 percent in the first half from
the year-ago period.  Exports to other euro-area countries increased 11.9 percent
while imports from nations using the common currency climbed
15.4 percent, the report showed. Shipments to  China  jumped 25.2
percent, exceeding a 9.1 percent increase in Chinese imports,
while exports to the U.S. rose 14 percent, less than the 14.7
percent gain in imports.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
