Thailand , the worldâ€™s largest rice
exporter, has no immediate plan to sell grain from state
stockpiles, Deputy Commerce Minister Poom Sarapol said.  The government will consider all alternatives to release
the stockpiles, including selling the grain under government-to-
government contracts, holding auctions for exporters and
offering the grain on the local futures exchange market, Poom
told reporters.  The government has about 2 million metric tons of rice in
state stockpiles,  Permanent Secretary  for Commerce Yanyong
Phuangrach said on Aug. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
