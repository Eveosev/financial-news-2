Bank bondholder participation in a
voluntary swap of Greek debt, part of a European Union financing
package for the country, is above 82 percent, Imerisia reported,
without saying how it got the information.  The goal of a 90 percent participation rate will be
achieved once pension funds and mutual fund companies are
included, the Athens-based newspaper said. The Greek Finance
Ministry has extended a deadline to participate in the swap to
mid-October, Imerisia said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
