Nigeria  sold 70 billion naira ($448
million) of bonds at an auction with yields for 5-year and 10-
year notes rising while that for 3-year debt declined.  Africa’s biggest oil producer sold 20 billion naira debt
due 2015 at 11.25 percent, 6 basis points higher than the last
auction on Aug. 17, and 25 billion naira of bonds due in 2018 at
11.49 percent, or 10 basis points higher. The yield for 25
billion naira of 2014 notes was 2.5 basis points lower at 10.50
percent, according to details published today on the website of
the Debt Management Office.  “Most traders had high expectations about interest rate hike
but some lowered theirs after inflation figures were released
yesterday,” Tayo Omidji, head of research at Lagos-based
Sterling Capital Ltd. said today by phone. “It explains the
rise in yields and also the decline witnessed.”  Nigeria raised its key rate to 8.75 percent on July 26, the
fourth increase this year, to rein in inflation. Another rate
announcement is due on Sept. 20. Price growth in the West
African country decelerated to 9.3 percent in August, the lowest
level in more than three years, the National Bureau of
Statistics said yesterday.  Though investors bid for 2.7 times the amount on offer,
there was no change in allotment, according to the Debt
Management Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
