CVC Capital Partners Ltd. is making
a renewed push to sell its Taminco amine-derivatives operation
after failing to agree on a deal with  Lanxess AG (LXS) , four people
familiar with the situation said.  Private equity firms such as Advent International Corp. and
Apollo Global Management LLC are being sent information about
Taminco to garner bids, said three of the people, who declined
to be identified because the sale process is private.  Negotiations with synthetic rubber maker Lanxess, which
offered about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) for the business,
failed earlier this year, and equity market volatility is
blocking a plan for an initial public offering of Taminco. CVCâ€™s
efforts to revive the sale is coinciding with increased caution
among chemical executives to make deals and stifled access to
credit that buyout firms need to make a purchase.  Taminco, which makes amines used in fertilizer, food and
consumer goods, may draw interest from Asian companies seeking
global expansion, the people said. Taminco, with sales of 715
million euros last year, has three of its eight production sites
in  China .  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
are advising CVC on the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
