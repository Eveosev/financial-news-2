Treasury Minister David Gauke said
the British government is introducing legislation to stop a tax-
avoidance scheme used mostly by financial companies to claim
repayment of income-tax contributions that were never made.  “We have acted quickly to prevent the use of this
particular scheme and we will not hesitate to close down other
schemes representing a significant risk to the exchequer as we
become aware of them,” Gauke said in a statement released by
the Treasury in  London  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
