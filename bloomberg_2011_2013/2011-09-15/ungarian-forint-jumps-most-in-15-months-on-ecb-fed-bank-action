The forint gained the most in 15
months against the euro and Hungarian bonds rallied, snapping
five days of losses, after an effort by central banks worldwide
to support banks’ liquidity increased demand for riskier assets.  The forint appreciated as much as 1.8 percent, the most
since June 2010, and rose 1.1 percent to 284.8 per euro as of
3:54 p.m. in Budapest. The Hungarian currency jumped 1.3 percent
to 236.3 per Swiss franc. The country’s benchmark government
bonds maturing in June 2022 rallied, cutting the yield 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 7.628 percent.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said that, in coordination with the
 Federal Reserve , the  Bank of England , the  Bank of Japan (8301)  and the
Swiss National Bank, it will conduct three U.S. dollar
liquidity-providing operations with a maturity of approximately
three months.  “We see some easing in risk aversion,” Peter Karsai, a
currency trader at Commerzbank AG in Budapest, said by
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
