owns China’s most popular online search engine, hosted a visit
from the nation’s Politburo member Li Changchun this month as
the government steps up monitoring of web service providers. Li
was joined in his Sept. 5 visit to Baidu by other Chinese

Beijing City, the Internet company said in a statement today.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  , operator of China’s fifth-most

on an alliance that may lead to an iPhone for the company’s
fourth generation TD-LTE network, Chairman  Wang Jianzhou  said.
“We hope Apple will produce a new iPhone with TD-LTE. We have
already got a positive answer from Apple,” Wang said in an
interview in Dalian today.  CNinsure Inc. (CISG)  , an insurance agency and brokerage
based in the southern Chinese city of  Guangzhou , tumbled 15
percent to $9.03, the lowest since May 2009. A group of
companies including TPG Capital’s Asia unit, who sent on May 14
a non-binding proposal to the company to buy CNinsure’s American
depositary receipts for $19 each with cash, have determined to
withdraw the going-private proposal, according to the company’s
statement today distributed through Globe Newswire.  Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM)  , a Vancouver-based Chinese
silver mine owner which was accused of fraud in an anonymous
letter last month, jumped 8.3 percent to $7.02. The company has
