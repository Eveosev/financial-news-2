Shinhan Financial Group Co. led
South Korean banks lower after Yonhap News reported the nation’s
financial watchdog plans to make lenders beef up foreign-
currency holdings as several failed stricter stress tests.  Shinhan Financial lost 4.4 percent to 38,450 won at the 3
p.m. close on the Korea Exchange, a two-year low. The 61-stock
Korea Financial Industry Index fell 0.8 percent to the lowest
level since April 2009. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rose 1.4 percent.  South Korea’s financial regulator last month completed
stress tests on local banks’ foreign-currency liquidity, Ernst Lee, spokesman for the Financial Services Commission, said by
phone, declining to elaborate further on the Yonhap report.  “The stress-test news damped sentiment toward bank stocks
today,” Shim Kyu Sun, an analyst at Seoul-based Hanwha
Securities Co., said by phone. “Ongoing debt problems in  Europe 
as well as a weaker local currency are serving as a drag.”  The won fell as low as 1,119.75 against the dollar today,
the weakest level since March. Eun Sung Soo, director general at
the  finance ministry , said authorities are “closely
monitoring” the foreign-exchange market and it’s “not
desirable” for the currency to move excessively.  KB Financial Group Inc. (105560) , owner of South Korea’s largest
bank, retreated 2 percent to 36,500 won.  Hana Financial Group
Inc. (086790)  lost 2 percent to 32,650 won.  To contact the reporters on this story:
