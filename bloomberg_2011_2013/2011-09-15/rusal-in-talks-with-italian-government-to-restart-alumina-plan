United Co. Rusal, the world’s
largest aluminum producer, is in talks with the Italian
government to restart the EurAllumina refinery in Sardinia.  Rusal is “exploring various opportunities” to resume
operations, the company said in an e-mailed response to queries
from Bloomberg. “No exact date for the plant restart can be
provided at this particular stage.”  It halted output at the plant, with capacity of 1.1 million
metric tons of alumina a year, in 2009. Rusal said Sept. 2 it
would raise production at Ireland’s Aughinish refinery,  Europe ’s
largest alumina plant, to 2 million tons a year from 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
