Dutch authorities said traces of a
mild variant of bird flu have been found in 83 swans at a trade
company in the northern Dutch town of Zuidwolde.  The infection was detected when the animals were tested for
export, the Dutch agriculture ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. The company is located in a low-poultry area,
so the swansâ€™ infection will be allowed to run its course in a
controlled manner, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
