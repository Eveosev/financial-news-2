The ruble reversed losses against
the dollar, climbing the most in a week after the  European
Central Bank  said it would coordinate with the  Federal Reserve 
to lend dollars to Euro-area banks.  The Russian currency added 0.6 to 30.2800 per dollar as of
5:26 p.m. in Moscow, erasing an earlier decline of as much as
0.4 percent. The ruble pared its retreat against the euro to 0.9
percent from as much as 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
