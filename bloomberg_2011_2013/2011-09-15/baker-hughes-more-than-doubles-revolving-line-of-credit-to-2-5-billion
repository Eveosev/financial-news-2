Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) , the world’s
third-largest oilfield services provider, said it obtained a
$2.5 billion revolving line of credit that more than doubles its
borrowing capacity  The five-year financing, which will be used for general
corporate purposes, replaced a $1.2 billion facility that was to
expire in March, the Houston-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the administrative
agent on the transaction.  The interest rate on borrowings under the new credit will
range from 0.625 percentage point to 1.125 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, depending on the
company’s debt rating.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Baker Hughes’s senior
unsecured debt A2, while  Standard & Poor’s  gives it an A, which
means that any borrowings would cost the company 0.875
percentage point more than Libor, according to the filing.  The previous loan, if drawn down, would have paid a rate
equal to Baker Hughes’s three-year credit default swap mid-rate
spread. The company’s three-year credit-default swap reached a
recent high of 104 basis points on June 11, 2010, three months
after the deal was closed, according to data provider CMA. That
spread is currently 42 basis points.  The company reported net income in the second quarter of
$388 million, or 77 cents a diluted share, compared with $93
million, or 23 cents, a year earlier, according to a regulatory
filing on Aug. 2.  Baker Hughes had $3.5 billion of long-term debt as of June
30, according to the filing, and $937 million of cash and cash
equivalents, down from $1.4 billion a year earlier.  Schlumberger Ltd. and Halliburton Co. are the world’s
largest oilfield services providers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
