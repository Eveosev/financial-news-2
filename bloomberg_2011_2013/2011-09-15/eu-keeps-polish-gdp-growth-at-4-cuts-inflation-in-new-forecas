The European Commission maintained
its forecast that  Poland ’s economy will expand by 4 percent this
year in its autumn interim forecast for the European Union’s
seven largest member states, which was published today.  Economic growth will slow on a quarterly basis to 0.6
percent in the third quarter and 0.5 percent in the fourth
quarter from 1.1 percent in the first and second quarters, the
Commission said in an e-mailed statement.  “The deteriorating global outlook is expected to further
drag down exports and consumer and producer confidence,
translating into more sluggish employment growth towards the end
of 2011,” the statement said. “Moreover, easing of real wage
growth is expected to limit the potential for a further rebound
on private consumption.”  Poland’s inflation rate will reach 3.7 percent for the full
year, according to the harmonized index of consumer prices,
below the Commission’s spring forecast of 3.8 percent. Price
growth “is expected to gradually ease to around 3.5 percent”
in the fourth quarter as food and fuel prices ease and domestic
and external demand slow, the Commission said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
