Finland ’s economic growth is
slowing faster than earlier forecast because of the European
debt crisis, Tapiola Bank said.  Gross domestic product will expand 2.8 percent this year
and 1 percent in 2012, Chief Economist Jari Jaervinen said today
in an e-mailed report. Tapiola had forecast growth 3.5 percent
in 2011 and 2 percent in 2012.  “The U.S. and the euro area may be heading for a
recession, which would inevitably cause GDP to contract in
Finland,” Jaervinen said. Exports account for about 40 percent
of the northernmost euro member’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
