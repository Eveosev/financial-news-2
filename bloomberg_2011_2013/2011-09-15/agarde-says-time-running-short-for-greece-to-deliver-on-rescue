International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said today that “time is
running short” for  Greece  to implement economic measures needed
for the next payment under the 110 billion-euro ($152.7 billion)
IMF and European Union rescue plan.  “If there has been no implementation, then we don’t pay,”
Lagarde said on CNBC television today. “Time is running short
and the Greek authorities have to deliver, have to come a little
bit more bipartisanly, if they can, to make sure the country is
on track.”  After almost two years combating the sovereign debt crisis
focused on Greece, Ireland and Portugal, European policy makers
have yet to reassure investors demanding higher yields from
nations such as Spain and Italy. The European Central Bank today
said it will lend dollars to euro-area banks in three separate
three-month loans to ensure they have enough of the U.S.
currency through the end of the year.  Lagarde said in a speech today she was “reassured” by a
statement by French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  that they are “convinced” Greece will
stay in the euro area.  The announcement by the ECB that it will coordinate with
the  Federal Reserve  and other central banks to conduct three
separate dollar liquidity operations is “exactly what is
needed,” she said on CNBC. “It shows that they will do what it
takes to actually maintain stability in the monetary system and
in the financial system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
