The Netherlands, the fifth-largest
economy in the euro area, forecast its 2012  budget deficit  to
be higher than previously estimated as economic growth slows.  The shortfall will narrow to 2.9 percent of gross domestic
product instead of the 2.2 percent predicted in June, according
to next year’s budget plan, which was posted on a government
website before its official release tomorrow. The figures were
confirmed by the  Finance Ministry .  The government planning agency CPB cut its forecast for
2012 economic growth to 1 percent from 1.75 percent.  “State finances still aren’t in order,” according to the
budget. “The government, even taking into account 18 billion
euros of austerity measures, will still spend more by 2015 than
it receives.”  CPB forecast that if the credit crisis worsens, next year’s
deficit will remain at 4.2 percent, breaching the European Union
limit of 3 percent for a fourth year. To prevent this, the
government needs 5 billion euros ($6.9 billion) of extra
austerity measures, according to the agency’s forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
