Italy  must continue and even
intensify fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, European
Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told
reporters in Brussels today.  “It is important that Italy will continue and even
intensify decisions on such structural measures that will boost
growth and restore confidence,” Rehn said. “In that context,
it is very important tackling the problems in its labor and
products markets. Further liberalization is especially needed,
especially in public services and closed professions. We are
working closely with Italy on this.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
