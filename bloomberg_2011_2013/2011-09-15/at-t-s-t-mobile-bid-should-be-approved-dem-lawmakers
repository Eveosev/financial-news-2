AT&T Inc. (T) ’s purchase of T-Mobile
USA Inc. should be approved, 15 Democratic lawmakers said today
in a letter to President Barack Obama.  The $39 billion merger would help create jobs and boost
investment in high-speed wireless  Internet service ,
Representative Heath Shuler, of North Carolina, and House
colleagues said in the  letter  distributed by e-mail.  The  Justice Department  filed a lawsuit seeking to block the
$39 billion deal on Aug. 31, saying the transaction would lessen
competition by eliminating one of the four largest wireless
carriers in the U.S.  The Justice Department should agree to a settlement of the
lawsuit “that ensures robust competition” while preserving the
deal’s benefits, Shuler and colleagues said in the letter.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-largest U.S. wireless
carrier and a merger opponent, said in an e-mail that the
transaction would eliminate “tens of thousands of jobs.”  “This matter is before the courts, not Congress, and we
are confident that the Department of Justice decision to
prosecute this unlawful transaction is the right one for
consumers, for competition, and for the economy,” John Taylor,
a Sprint spokesman, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
