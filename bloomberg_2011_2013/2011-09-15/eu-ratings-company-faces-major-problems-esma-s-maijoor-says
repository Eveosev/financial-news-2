Plans to create a government-funded
credit-rating company in the European Union face “major
problems,” the head of the region’s markets regulator said.  The idea threatens to “distort competition” with private
companies and  could “discourage” new firms from entering the
market,’’ Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities
and Markets Authority, wrote in an article published by the
organizers of the Eurofi financial forum in Wroclaw,  Poland ,
today.  There is also a risk that ratings issued by the government-
backed firm would not be “independently determined,” Maijoor
said. Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European
Commission, has said that such an agency should have at least
some private funding.  The commission, the 27-nation EU’s executive arm, has said
that it is considering the creation of a European credit-rating
firm as one option for increasing diversity in the market for
rating sovereign debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
