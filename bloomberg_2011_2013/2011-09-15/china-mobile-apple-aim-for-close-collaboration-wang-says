China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s
largest mobile-phone company by users, aims to work with  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  on an alliance that may lead to an iPhone for the company’s
fourth-generation TD-LTE network, Chairman  Wang Jianzhou  said.  “China Mobile and Apple hope to find a solution for close
collaboration” on the TD-LTE network and compatible products,
Wang said in an interview in Dalian today. “We discussed this
issue with Apple. We hope Apple will produce a new iPhone with
TD-LTE. We have already got a positive answer from Apple.”  China Mobile is looking to add the iPhone to help keep its
lead over China Unicom ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. among subscribers who
use mobile phones to surf the Web and download games or videos.
Unicom is the nation’s only carrier that currently offers the
Apple smartphone with a service contract.  China Mobile’s homegrown third-generation TD-SCDMA network
technology isn’t compatible with current iPhones. Still, China
Mobile attracted 8.5 million iPhone users to its second-
generation network, Wang said today. Those users either accept
slower Internet connections on the 2G network, or access the Web
over the company’s Wi-Fi network.  The carrier got regulatory approval in December for limited
trials of the TD-LTE network, which the company has said it aims
to roll out for commercial use starting next year.  China Mobile had 37.6 million subscribers on its 3G TD-
SCDMA network at the end of July, while China Unicom had 25.8
million subscribers on its W-CDMA network in the same period.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
