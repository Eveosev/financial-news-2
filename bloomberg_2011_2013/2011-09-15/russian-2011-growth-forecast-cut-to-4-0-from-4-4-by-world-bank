Russia ’s economy is slowing as a
faltering global recovery erodes demand for oil, the  World Bank 
said as it lowered its 2011 growth forecast for the world’s
largest energy exporter.  The Washington-based lender expects Russia’s economy to
expand 4 percent this year, down from a June prediction of 4.4
percent, the bank said today in an e-mailed report. Gross
domestic product will rise 3.8 percent next year, it said.  “Downside risks to global growth and commodity prices have
risen sharply since August,” the bank said. The reduced
forecast also reflects “the impact on domestic demand of the
external conditions.”  Eastern Europe’s export-led recovery from its worst slump
since the end of communism is running out of steam as the U.S.
struggles to avoid a new recession and the euro-area debt crisis
spreads. Russian growth missed analyst forecasts in the last two
quarters, complicating President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s aim of
boosting annual growth to 8 percent or more within 5 years to
keep pace with the other so-called BRIC countries.  Slower growth will diminish Russian inflationary pressures,
the World Bank said, lowering its forecast for average price
growth this year to 7.5 percent from an earlier prediction of as
much as 8 percent.  Global growth will slow to 2.8 percent in 2011 from 3.8
percent last year, the World Bank said. It cut its oil price
forecast to $103.00 per barrel in 2011, $94.70 per barrel in
2012 and $88.50 in 2015.  ‘Fiscal Buffers’  Oil and gas account for 17 percent of Russian GDP and
contribute about 40 percent to government revenue. Urals crude,
Russia’s export blend, was little changed at $114.18 per barrel
at 2:05 p.m. in Moscow today. It has declined 7 percent from
this year’s April 8 peak of $122.88.  While oil revenue will result in an almost balanced budget
this year, the  World Bank  called on the government to overhaul
public finances as it prepares to reduce reliance on volatile
commodities revenue.  “A large non-oil deficit requires concerted medium-term
fiscal adjustment to replenish fiscal buffers and to move toward
long-term sustainable levels of the non-oil deficit,” the World
Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
