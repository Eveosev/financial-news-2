The Kenyan central bank’s Monetary
Policy Committee canceled a meeting scheduled for the end of
this month after holding a special meeting yesterday, said
Sheila M’Mbijjewe, a member of the MPC.  “The MPC had a very extensive meeting yesterday and we
will continue to monitor the situation,” M’Mbijjewe said in a
phone interview today from Nairobi. “We will meet whenever
necessary. But the meeting that was originally scheduled at the
end of the month will be not necessary.”  The law requires the committee meets at least every two
months, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
