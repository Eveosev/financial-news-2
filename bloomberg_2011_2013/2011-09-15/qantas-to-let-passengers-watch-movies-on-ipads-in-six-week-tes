Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) ,  Australia â€™s
biggest airline, will test a system that lets passengers watch
TV shows and movies on Apple Corp. iPads and other tablet
computers during flights.  A six-week trial of the wireless system will begin next
month on a domestic route flown by a Boeing Co. 767-300 plane,
the Sydney-based carrier said by e-mail today. Passengers will
be able to view the entertainment on their own Wifi-enabled
devices or on ones supplied by the carrier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
