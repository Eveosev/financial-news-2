 Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd.
said it is committed to emissions reductions and will continue
to work within the business and on-farm to see them achieved.  Still, “Fonterra remains concerned that applying carbon
costs on agriculture in  New Zealand , when they are not applied
elsewhere in the world, would shift dairy production to far less
emission-efficient countries,’’ Kelvin Wickham, group director
for supplier and external relations, said in a statement. “The
net result would be no reduction in global emissions”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
