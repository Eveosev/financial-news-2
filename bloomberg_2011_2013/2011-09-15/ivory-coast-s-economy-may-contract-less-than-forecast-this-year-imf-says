Ivory Coast ’s economy will probably
contract 5.8 percent this year, less than previously forecast,
the International Monetary Fund said.  The economic recovery after a post-election crisis has been
faster than expected and the economy may expand as much as 9
percent in 2012, the Washington-based institution said in a
statement on its website today.  The IMF has agreed to give the West African nation a loan
of about $614 million, subject to approval from its board in
November, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
