Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s  David Kostin  slashed his year-end forecast for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index by 11 percent to 1,250, citing continued uncertainty
in the global markets due to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Kostin, the equity strategist at the firm, previously
predicted the benchmark equity index would climb to 1,400. This
was Kostin’s second  S&P 500  forecast reduction in the past two
months, following his shift from 1,450 on Aug. 5.  “The unstable macro environment is likely to persist for
the foreseeable future because Europe currently lacks both the
institutional structure and policy tools to solve the festering
sovereign debt crisis,” the New York-based strategist wrote in
a report dated yesterday. “Investors believe a nontrivial
probability exists that the crisis will trigger a global
financial dislocation similar to 2008.”  Investors have fled risky assets since July amid concern
European officials may fail to contain the region’s debt crisis
and the  U.S. economy  will slip into a recession, sending yields
on 10-year Treasuries to a record low and pushing the S&P 500
down as much as 18 percent from its April high. Goldman Sachs is
the third Wall Street firm to cut its forecast for stocks this
week, following Wells Fargo & Co. and Barclays Plc.  Kostin kept his estimates on earnings by companies in the
S&P 500 at $96 a share this year and $102 in 2012. The index
rose 1.7 percent to 1,209.11 at 4 p.m. New York time, the fourth
straight day of gains amid optimism Europe is working to tame
the credit crisis. The  European Central Bank  said today it will
lend dollars to euro-area banks in a series of three-month loans
to ensure they have enough of the U.S. currency through the end
of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
