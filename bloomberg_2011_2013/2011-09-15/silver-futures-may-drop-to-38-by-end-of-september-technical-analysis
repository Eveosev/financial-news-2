Silver futures may extend this
month’s decline, the first since June, according to  technical
analysis  by Steel Vine Investments LLC.  The precious metal probably will slide to $38 an ounce by
the end of September, down 3.8 percent from yesterday’s closing
price on the Comex in New York, after the commodity dropped
below the support level on a trendline connecting the lows of
July 1 through Sept. 7, according to Spencer Patton, the
Chicago-based chief investment officer for Steel Vine.  Yesterday, silver futures for December delivery fell
$1.032, or 2.5 percent, to settle at $39.501. Prices rallied in
July and August and have more than tripled since 2008. On April
25, the metal reached $49.845, the highest since January 1980.  “Silver, which was showing signs to trend higher, broke
below the medium-term uptrend line” on Sept. 12, Patton said in
a telephone interview yesterday. “Silver looks vulnerable.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
