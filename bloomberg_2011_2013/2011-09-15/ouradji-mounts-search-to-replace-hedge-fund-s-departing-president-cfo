Paul Touradji, founder of
commodities hedge fund Touradji Capital Management LP, said he
is looking for “world-class” leaders to replace Chief
Financial Officer Tom Dwan and President Sang Lee.  Dwan will leave later this month to join another firm, New
York-based Touradji Capital said today in a letter to investors.
Lee, who is leaving the firm on an unspecified date, will assist
Controller Ed Min, who will assume Dwan’s duties, according to
the letter.  Touradji said he plans to focus more on investing, while
delegating much of the day-to-day operations to others. He said
the fund will allow investors to withdraw their money without
penalty while the changes take place.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Touradji Capital, declined to
comment on the letter, a copy of which was posted on AR
Magazine’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
