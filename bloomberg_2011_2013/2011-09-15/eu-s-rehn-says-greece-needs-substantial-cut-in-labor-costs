European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said  Greece  needs a
“substantial” cut in labor costs in order to make its economy
more competitive.  “Given the losses of competitiveness accumulated in the
previous decade, a further substantial reduction in unit labor
costs will be necessary to recover competitiveness and
contribute to healthy growth,” Rehn said in response to a
written question from the European Parliament. “According to
Eurostat, growth of unit labor costs in Greece exceeded that in
the euro area by almost 20 percent over the period 2000-2009,
showing a marked deterioration in Greece’s cost competitiveness
vis-à-vis its euro-area partners.”  In his response, dated Sept. 14, Rehn said “sustainable
increases” in  labor productivity  “can only be achieved by
structural reforms,” adding that “privatization and state-
owned enterprises’ restructuring will also contribute decisively
to the growth of productivity in the  Greek economy .”  Noting that Greece’s hourly labor costs fell 6.8 percent in
the first quarter, Rehn said “the cuts in labor costs are not
yet sufficient to recover the competitiveness lost during the
previous decade.” The response was posted on the Parliament’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
