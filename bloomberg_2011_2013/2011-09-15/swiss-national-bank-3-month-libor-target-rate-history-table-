The following table details the
changes in the Swiss National Bankâ€™s 3-month LIBOR target
rate.  Since Bloomberg started surveys for the  interest rate 
in September 2004 there have been a total of 33 rate decisions
by the bank for which surveys were conducted. In 0 cases the
survey did not match the decision made, resulting in the survey
correctly predicting the decision 100.0% of the time.  NOTE: Unscheduled meetings on Oct. 8, 2009, Nov. 6, 2008, Nov. 20, 2008
and Aug. 3, 2011.
* Expected is when Bloomberg News survey median is equal to the announced rate.
Unexpected is when announced rate is not equal to Bloomberg News survey median.  SOURCE:  Swiss National Bank   To contact the reporter on this story:
