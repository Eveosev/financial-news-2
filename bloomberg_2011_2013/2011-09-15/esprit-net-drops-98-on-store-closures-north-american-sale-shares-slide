Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the biggest
Hong Kong-listed clothing retailer, dropped the most in almost
three years as profit plunged 98 percent on costs for closing
stores and selling its U.S. and Canada operations.  Esprit fell 17.6 percent to HK$15.08 at the 4 p.m. close of
trading in Hong Kong. Net income plunged to HK$79 million ($10
million) in the 12 months ended June from HK$4.23 billion in the
previous year, according to a statement by the company. Eleven
analysts in a Bloomberg survey had a mean estimate of HK$3.14
billion.  “The brand has gradually lost its soul over the past few
years,” Esprit said in a filing. “The heritage of the brand
has been neglected and the company lost its customer focus.”  Esprit said it will focus its brand-building efforts in
Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and China after
posting its third consecutive decline in annual profit. The
casual clothing maker gets 79 percent of sales from Europe,
which is mired in a debt crisis that is weakening consumer
sentiment and economic growth.  “If the brand is to recover, management needs to invest
significantly in the business, which means the earnings are not
going to grow for a long period of time, say at least two
years,” said Aaron Fischer, an analyst with CLSA Asia Pacific
Markets in Hong Kong. He rates the stock “underperform.”  Profit excluding exceptional items fell 30 percent to
HK$2.35 billion, Esprit  said  in its earnings statement to Hong
Kong’s stock exchange.  Capital Expenditure  Esprit had its biggest intraday decline in Hong Kong
trading since Oct. 27, 2008, and was the worst performer on the
benchmark Hang Seng Index, which gained 0.7 percent. The stock
has lost 59 percent this year.  The retailer that started in 1968 in California plans about
HK$7 billion of capital expenditure over the next four years,
Chief Executive Officer Ronald Van der Vis said in a briefing in
Hong Kong today. Additional operational costs over the same
period will amount to HK$11.5 billion, of which HK$6.8 billion
will be spent on branding, he said.  Esprit said it’s targeting 8 percent to 10 percent
cumulative average sales growth, in local currency terms, for
the next four years. The retailer had 178 stores in Germany, 43
in France and 161 in Australia as of June 30. It had 1,141
retail outlets in total and operates 11,704 points of sale under
its wholesale business.  Revenue for the 12 months through June was little changed
at HK$33.8 billion. Esprit forecast sales to drop 3 percent to 5
percent in local currency terms in the fiscal year ending June
2012.  Store Closures  It set aside about HK$1.7 billion for store closures,
almost four times the previous year’s, and HK$944 million for
the sale of its operations in North America. The retailer said
it has identified 80 outlets to be closed in Europe and the
Asia-Pacific region. Among the shops to be closed are 24 in
Germany, 13 in Australia and 12 in France, according to a
company presentation.  Closing the stores and the sale of the North American
operations narrowed operating profit margin by 7.2 percentage
points to 2 percent, Esprit said. The company expects to make a
decision on the North American sale within eight weeks, said Van
der Vis, who added that the “preferred option” was to find a
partner to take over the unit.  Rising Costs  Occupancy costs rose 12 percent to HK$4.4 billion and staff
expenses rose 8.7 percent to HK$4.9 billion.  Operating profit fell to HK$692 million from HK$3.8 billion
a year earlier and the company doesn’t plan to pay a final
dividend.  Europe accounted for 79.1 percent of Esprit’s sales in the
year, while the Asia-Pacific region comprised 17.2 percent,
according to the statement. Europe sales accounted for 83
percent in the previous 12-month period.  “European consumption is likely to be under pressure in
the coming months, but Esprit’s sales trends will depend above
all on the new management’s ability to improve the appeal of the
brand,” Anne Critchlow, an analyst at Societe Generale in
London, said before the earnings announcement.  “Esprit’s problems include the wholesale division losing
selling space due to customer closures and insolvencies in
Germany and the economic downturn in Europe,” said Critchlow,
who rates the stock “buy”.  The retail business increased 7 percent to HK$19.1 billion
to account for 56.4 percent of its total sales, up from 53
percent a year earlier, Esprit said. The wholesale division,
which includes franchises and “shops in stores,” had sales of
HK$14.5 billion, accounting for 42.9 percent.  --Michael Wei, Frank Longid. Editor: Frank Longid  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
