South Africa  postponed the opening
of bids for its nuclear power-plant build program to next year
because of safety concerns following the meltdown of reactors in
Fukushima,  Japan , South African Energy Minister Dipuo Peters
said.  Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the state-owned South African
power utility, will be the main driver of the countryâ€™s nuclear
power plants and will invite partners, Peters told reporters in
Johannesburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
