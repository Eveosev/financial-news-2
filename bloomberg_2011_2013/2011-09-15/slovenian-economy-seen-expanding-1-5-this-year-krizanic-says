Slovenia’s economy will expand at
1.5 percent this year, slower than the previous forecast of 1.8
percent, Finance Minister  Franc Krizanic  told lawmakers in
 Ljubljana  today, according to a live broadcast by TV Slovenija.  “Export growth, the main engine of our economy, is slowing
as demand in our main markets in  Europe  eases,” Krizanic said
as he presented the 2011 budget review targeting spending cuts
of about 370 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
