INA Industrija Nafte d.d. has
authorized Zoltan Aldott, the head of the management board, to
continue to act as the company’s chief executive officer until
the end of the year, the refiner said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Aldott took over as head of the company on June 15 after
the departure of former Chief Bojan Milkovic. Milkovic was
removed from the post at his own request following his March 26
arrest on corruption charges requested by  Croatia ’s Office for
Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime.  Croatia’s biggest refiner is controlled by Hungary’s Mol
Nyrt., which owns 47.47 percent of INA. The government holds
44.84 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
