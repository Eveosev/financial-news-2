Greece  won’t be able to avoid a
sovereign default even with an expanded European bailout fund,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing an analysis from the Kiel,
Germany-based IfW Institute.  The government in  Athens  would have to generate surpluses
that have been historically impossible in order to remain
solvent, the newspaper cited the researchers as saying. Greece’s
fiscal problems won’t be manageable without a “significant”
debt restructuring, the research paper cited by Sueddeutsche
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
