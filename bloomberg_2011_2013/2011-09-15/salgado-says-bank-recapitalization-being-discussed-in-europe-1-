Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said
a “new recapitalization” of the financial industry is “being
discussed in Europe,” and Spain has already shored up its
banks’ capital levels.  “At the moment we are talking about a new recapitalization
of the European financial sector, whether we share this
necessity or not,” she told reporters in Madrid today.  Spain increased  capital requirements  for lenders in
February and gave them until Sept. 30 to meet the new rules. The
government has shepherded struggling savings banks into mergers
and encouraged them to recapitalize via private investors to
reduce the impact on public coffers.  “When in February we adopted a decree on Spanish banks’
capital requirements of 8 to 10 percent, many said this was
exaggerated and created difficulties for the Spanish financial
sector to compete with other entities,” Salgado said. “And now
we are talking about an additional and nearly general
recapitalization of the financial system in  Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
