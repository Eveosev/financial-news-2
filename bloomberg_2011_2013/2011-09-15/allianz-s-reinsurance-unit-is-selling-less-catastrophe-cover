Allianz SE (ALV) ’s reinsurance unit is
selling less hurricane and earthquake coverage to third parties
as it focuses on commercial property and casualty and
agricultural policies.  “Allianz Re plans to write fewer peak risks in its open
market business,” Clemens von Weichs, chief executive officer
of the unit of Europe’s biggest insurer, said in an interview in
 Monte Carlo . “We want to diversify into other lines of
business.”  Allianz Re’s annual sales to third parties will remain at
about 600 million euros ($822 million), said Von Weichs, who was
in Monaco as reinsurers begin talks this week over 2012
renewals. Total gross written premiums for the unit last year
were 4.39 billion euros.  Natural disasters, including the earthquake and tsunami in
 Japan  and the temblor in New Zealand, caused record first-half
insured losses of $70 billion, eroding reinsurers’ capital.
Should reinsurers sell less catastrophe cover, natural disasters
may cause greater economic damage, according to  Gerry Brownlee ,
New Zealand’s Earthquake Recovery minister.  “If reinsurers don’t sell coverage, the funding for losses
will come out of our economy,” said Brownlee, who was in Monte
Carlo to convince reinsurers not to pull out of the country. Two
earthquakes in New Zealand over the past 12 months cost as much
as NZ$30 billion ($24.7 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
