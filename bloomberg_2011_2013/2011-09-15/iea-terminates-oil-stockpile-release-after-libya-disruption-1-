The  International Energy Agency 
ended its program to release oil stockpiles in response to
shuttered Libyan crude output, the energy adviser to
industrialized nations said.  “The interrupted Libyan supplies have been successfully
addressed by a combination of the IEA collective action and
increased production from producer countries, against a backdrop
now of weakening expectations for global oil demand growth,”
the Paris-based agency said today in a  statement .  The IEA coordinated the emergency release of 60 million
barrels of crude and refined products on June 23, including 38
million barrels from government-held reserves. Public
inventories were sold to the market in July and August.  “Uptake of public stocks has been 97 percent, compared
with 73 percent at the time of the 2005 collective action”
after  Hurricane Katrina , the IEA said.  The agency’s governing board, with has representatives from
28 member countries, decided to end the stockpile release at a
meeting in Paris today, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
