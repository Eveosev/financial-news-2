Terna SpA,  Italy ’s power grid
operator, said an increased government levy on utilities dubbed
the “Robin Hood Tax” will cost it 80 million euros ($110
million) this year.  The effect of the increase on the 2012-2015 period isn’t
yet clear as the regulatory framework has still to be defined,
the Rome-based company said today in a stock-exchange statement.  The law, passed in August and ratified by parliament
yesterday, is part of the government’s austerity program. The
profit tax is being raised to 10.5 percent from 6.5 percent. The
changes will net the Italian government 1.8 billion euros in
2012 and 900 million euros in the following two years, according
to a UniCredit report last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
