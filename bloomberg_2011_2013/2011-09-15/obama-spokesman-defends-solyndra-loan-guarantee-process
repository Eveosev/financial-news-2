White House press secretary  Jay
Carney  defended the Energy Department process for providing
government loan guarantees, including one that went to Solyndra
LLC, a solar-panel maker that has filed for bankruptcy.  The process for making decisions on such guarantees is
“merit-based” and carried out by career employees at the
Energy Department, Carney said at a White House briefing.  Solyndra’s bankruptcy has sparked congressional
investigations into whether the White House sought to rush a
decision on the loan guarantee. Carney has denied any effort by
White House officials to exert pressure on the approval process.  Carney said today that the administration makes no
apologies for efforts to boost clean-energy development, saying
U.S. economic competitors are moving forward on research and
manufacturing.  “We cannot cede these industries to our competitors
globally,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
