China  slashed spending on railway
construction 50 percent last month as it slowed building work
following the nation’s deadliest high-speed train crash.  Spending in August plunged to 33 billion yuan ($5.2
billion) from 65.5 billion yuan a year earlier, based on
Ministry of Railways  data  released today. The eight-month total
declined 11 percent to 316.5 billion yuan, the ministry said.  China also cut spending 26 percent in July as it undertakes
safety checks and investigates the cause of the July 23 crash
near the eastern city of Wenzhou that killed 40 people.  China
Railway Group Ltd. (390)  and China Railway Construction Corp., the
nation’s two biggest railway builders, have plunged more than 40
percent since the accident.  China’s rail network is set to reach 120,000 kilometers
(75,000 miles) under a 2.8 trillion yuan, five-year investment
plan running through 2015. That includes boosting the high-speed
network, which opened in 2007, to 16,000 kilometers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
