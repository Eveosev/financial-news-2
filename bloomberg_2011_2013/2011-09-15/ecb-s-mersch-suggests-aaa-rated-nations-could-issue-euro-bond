European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Yves Mersch  suggested the euro area’s AAA-rated
nations could issue a common bond as a step toward fiscal union.  “For me, the euro bond would be imaginable among countries
with AAA ratings,” Mersch said at a conference in Luxembourg
today. “With one proviso: as soon as one of those country loses
its AAA status, it would have to repay the whole debt. Then we
would have the embryo of a stability-oriented fiscal union.”  Of the euro area’s 17 nations, Austria, Germany, France,
 Finland , the Netherlands and Luxembourg have AAA credit ratings.  Mersch, who heads Luxembourg’s central bank, said he is not
an “ardent supporter” of using euro bonds as a solution to
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis. The crisis that began in  Greece 
in late 2009 has triggered 365 billion euros ($502 billion) in
emergency bailout loans and exposed cracks in the euro’s
architecture.  Mersch said while governments have taken “a certain leap
forward” since a July 21 summit, Europe is nevertheless facing
a “gap in implementation confidence” and “markets have lost
patience.” He said Europe’s leaders have to deliver on what
they promised.  Mersch also rejected a Dutch proposal for an independent
European Union commissioner to enforce budget discipline among
member states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
