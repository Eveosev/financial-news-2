The Czech  Finance Ministry  plans to
start selling state bonds to citizens this year and wants
households to eventually hold about 10 percent of government
debt.  The “pilot” issue of state bonds to citizens, worth 10
billion koruna ($562 million), will take place in November,
Finance Minister Kalousek told reporters in Prague today.
“Massive sales will start from January 1, 2012,” he said,
adding the amount sold next year should be a “multiple” of the
issue from 2011.  “My dream is that, one day, the households will hold about
10 percent of state debt,” Kalousek said.  The Czech Republic’s gross borrowing needs will rise to 226
billion koruna in 2012 from 220 billion koruna planned for this
year, according to the draft of next year’s state budget.  The government in  Prague  plans to cover its borrowing needs
by selling 146.6 billion koruna in medium- and long-term bonds,
issuing an equivalent of 23.5 billion koruna in foreign bonds,
selling 50 billion koruna in Treasury bills and taking 5.9
billion koruna in loans from the  European Investment Bank , the
draft posted on the Cabinet’s website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
