Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) ,
creator of the “Mad Men” television drama, named its largest
shareholder  Mark Rachesky  as co-chairman of the board.  Rachesky, who holds a 37 percent stake, will share the
title with Chief Executive Officer Jon Feltheimer, according to
a regulatory filing.  Rachesky, a Lions Gate director since 2009, is taking on a
larger role following an Aug. 30 settlement in which Carl Icahn
agreed to sell his shares and end a battle for control of the
studio. Rachesky, president of MHR Fund Management LLC, agreed
to buy 11 million shares of Icahn’s stock at $7 each as part of
the deal. Rachesky had supported the Vancouver-based company’s
management throughout their dispute with Icahn.  Lions Gate, run from  Santa Monica , California, said in a
statement today it has finished shooting “The Hunger Games,”
the first film based on the young-adult novels by Suzanne
Collins. The film is scheduled for release on March 23. The
movie, set in a post-apocalyptic society, stars Jennifer
Lawrence as a teen, who is forced to participate in a televised
fight to the death with other youths.  The company rose 12 cents to $7.08 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are up 8.8 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
