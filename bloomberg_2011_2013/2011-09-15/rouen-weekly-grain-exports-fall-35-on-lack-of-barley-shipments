Grain loadings for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell
to the lowest in seven weeks on an absence of barley shipments
and as  Algeria  took less wheat.  Outbound shipments were 75,724 metric tons between Sept. 8
and 14, down from 116,329 metric tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Outgoing cargoes
didn’t include any barley for the first time since March.  Algeria, the biggest buyer of French grain, was the leading
destination with 45,200 tons of wheat compared with 72,945 tons
a week earlier, the port said.  Libya  was the destination for
23,400 tons of wheat, the first shipments to the country from
Rouen since January.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s wheat exports in
2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay, which shipped
out 19 percent, according to data from national crops office
FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
