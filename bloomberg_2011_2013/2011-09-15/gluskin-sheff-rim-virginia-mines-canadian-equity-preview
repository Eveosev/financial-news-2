Canadian stocks fell, erasing a
weekly gain, as  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  plunged after reporting
earnings that missed the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  RIM, the BlackBerry maker, tumbled 20 percent in Toronto
Stock Exchange trading.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , Canada’s fifth-
largest energy company, fell 4.4 percent as crude oil declined.
 Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest gold producer by
market value, climbed 0.9 percent as the metal rebounded from a
September low.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 161.13
points, or 1.3 percent, to 12,263.71, ending the week down 1
percent.  RIM’s “net income was down over 50 percent from last
year,” Jennifer Radman, a  money manager  at Caldwell Investment
Management Ltd. in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. The
firm oversees about C$1 billion ($1 billion). “That’s pretty
scary to people.”  The S&P/TSX gained earlier this week as France and  Germany 
expressed support for  Greece ’s place in the euro region and the
 European Central Bank  coordinated with international policy
makers to lend dollars to banks.  Canada ’s stock benchmark is set
to decline for a seventh straight month, the longest streak
since 1984, as energy and financial stocks have retreated on
concern the global economic recovery is in jeopardy.  RIM Tumbles  RIM reported second-quarter earnings of 80 cents a share,
trailing the average analyst estimate by 9.4 percent, excluding
certain items. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company sold fewer
than half as many PlayBook tablets as analysts had forecast on
average.  The company’s shares tumbled 20 percent to C$23.50 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. In composite trading, RIM fell 2.1
percent to C$23.50 after sinking 19 percent when the company
disclosed its results yesterday. The shares have plunged 60
percent this year.  Crude futures dropped 1.6 percent in  New York  while
European finance ministers met in Wroclaw,  Poland , to address
the continent’s debt crisis.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, declined 2.9 percent to
C$34.20. Cenovus lost 4.4 percent to C$32.61.  Talisman Energy
Inc. (TLM) , an oil and gas producer with operations in  North America ,
the North Sea and Indonesia, decreased 5 percent to C$14.30.  TD, Royal Bank  Canada’s six largest banks and all eight S&P/TSX insurance
stocks fell. Toronto-Dominion Bank, the country’s second-largest
lender by assets, dropped 2.1 percent to C$73.60.  Royal Bank of
Canada (RY) , its bigger domestic rival, declined 2.5 percent to
C$46.30. Manulife Financial Corp., Canada’s largest insurer,

percent to C$50.29.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , its larger peer, gained
0.9 percent to C$52.52.  OceanaGold Corp (OGC) , which mines in  New
Zealand , soared 11 percent, the most since May 2010, to C$2.88.  Iamgold Corp. (IMG)  advanced 2.8 percent to C$21.59 after Sabrina Grandchamps, an analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc, raised her ratings
on the shares to “overweight” from “neutral.” Higher gold
prices will boost mining companies’ cash flow, HSBC said in a
note to clients.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, slipped 3.2 percent to
C$54.50. Investors should sell some of their shares of
fertilizer producers now that farmers have bought most of what
they need for the Northern Hemisphere autumn, Charles Neivert,
an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co., said in a note to clients.  Propane distributor  Superior Plus Corp. (SPB)  climbed 5.9 percent
from a record-low close to C$8.79. The shares had tumbled 12
percent since DBRS Ltd. cut its credit ratings on the company
Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
