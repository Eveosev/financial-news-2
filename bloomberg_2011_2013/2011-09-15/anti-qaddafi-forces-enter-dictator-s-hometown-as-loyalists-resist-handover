Libyan forces opposed to Muammar Qaddafi said they have entered his hometown of Sirte, where
loyalists are resisting a peaceful handover of control.  About 900 armed  pickup trucks , the largest fleet assembled
by the forces for a single operation again Qaddafi’s supporters,
advanced on Sirte “to free the city and raise the banner of
independence above it,” the fighters’ Misrata Military Council
said in a statement today. The units reached the city’s Gardabya
Bridge, the council said.  Qaddafi loyalists in Sirte were preventing civilians from
leaving, according to the statement. The Misrata council’s
forces said supplies of food, water and medicine were being
moved toward Sirte to deliver to the civilian population.  Pro-Qaddafi forces also continue to control Bani Walid, 145
kilometers (90 miles) south of Tripoli, almost four weeks after
rebels took the capital and the southern towns of Hun and Sabha.
The whereabouts of Qaddafi remain unknown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
