Corn dropped on concern demand from
producers of ethanol is declining and makers of livestock feeds
may seek cheaper substitutes. Wheat fell.  December-delivery corn lost 0.6 percent to $7.2025 a bushel
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 2:10 p.m. Singapore time. The
grain climbed 46 percent in the past year, beating a 3.4 percent
decline in wheat.  Output of ethanol in the U.S. fell 1.9 percent to 879,000
barrels a day last week, the lowest level since the week ended
July 29, according to a Department of Energy report. Feed
millers will probably use less corn and more wheat in rations
for livestock and poultry feeds, the Department of Agriculture
said Sept. 12.  “The market has become increasingly focused on demand
destruction in recent weeks,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said in a report
today. “Wheat feeding is expected to displace an increasing
proportion of corn use.”  Global corn use in  animal feed  will drop to 505.1 million
metric tons this season from 510 million tons estimated a month
earlier, the USDA said Sept. 12.  Wheat for December delivery slipped 0.4 percent to $7.02 a
bushel in Chicago. Soybeans for November delivery wa little
changed at $13.8425 a bushel.  Exports of wheat from Australia, set to be the world’s
second-biggest shipper, may be between 19 million to 19.5
million metric tons, missing the government forecast for a
record 20.4 million tons in the year beginning Oct. 1, Paul
Deane, an agricultural economist at Australia New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. said in an interview Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
