NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse
AG (DB1)  said their planned merger will save clients an additional $1
billion as the exchanges seek to allay the concerns of
regulators and customers about the takeover.  Brokers will likely achieve “collateral efficiencies” of
as much as $4 billion, compared with a previously forecast $3
billion, according to Ruediger Assion, a spokesman for
Frankfurt-based  Deutsche Boerse . “Direct customer cost
savings” are expected to be $75 million to $100 million, he
said in an e-mail.  The  Association for Financial Markets in Europe , a group
that represents banks and brokers including  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) , Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG, told
regulators it has identified seven areas for further antitrust
scrutiny in a submission to the European Commission obtained by
Bloomberg News. The exchanges forecast cost savings of $400
million when they announced the deal in February. AFME said it
“has seen nothing to suggest that a fair share of any such
savings would be passed on to end users.”  European Union Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia
said today that he’s “concerned” the proposed tie-up between
Deutsche Boerse and  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  may monopolize the derivatives
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
