Wheat futures fell after  Egypt , the
world’s biggest importer of the grain, bought more Russian wheat
and again shunned U.S. and European Union inventories.  Egypt bought 420,000 metric tons of Russian wheat for
shipment from Nov. 21 to Dec. 10, it said yesterday. The North
African country said, on Sept. 7, it bought 300,000 tons of the
grain from Russia and  Kazakhstan . Overseas buyers have committed
to purchase 12.8 million tons of U.S. wheat since the start of
the marketing year on June 1, down 15 percent from a year
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “Some countries now are starting to prefer to buy from
Russia,” said  William Adams , a portfolio manager at Resilience
AG in Zurich, which launched a commodities, equities and foreign
exchange fund on Aug. 26. “ Russia  is $10-$15 a ton cheaper so
that’s a significant discount. The U.S. doesn’t really have as
much demand as expected.”  Wheat for December delivery fell 5 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $6.995 a bushel by 1:46 p.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices are down 12 percent this month. Milling wheat
for November delivery on NYSE Liffe in Paris declined 1.6
percent to 198.75 euros ($273.64) a ton.  Corn futures declined on speculation that high prices had
hurt demand for the grain, said Justine White, an analyst at VM
Group in London. Losses will be curbed because the U.S. crop is
expected to be worse than forecast by the government, she said.  “There might be some concern that corn prices have climbed
to levels at which we could start to see some demand destruction
and feed substitution where possible,” White said. “The
downside potential is still limited by supply concerns and tight
inventories.”  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $7.1925 a bushel in  Chicago . Prices are down 6.3
percent in September. The price had jumped 22 percent this year
through August.  Soybeans for November delivery dropped 2.5 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $13.8025 a bushel. The oilseed declined 1.3 percent
last week and has dropped in the past four sessions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
