German Christian Democratic
lawmaker Michael Meister urged Economy Minister Philipp Roesler
to be “more careful” in talking about an orderly insolvency in
the euro region while  Greece  is seeking to avoid default.  The euro area doesn’t have a system for an orderly default
yet, Meister, the finance spokesman in parliament for Chancellor
Angela Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union , told reporters in
Berlin today. “This is why I think we should perhaps be a bit
more careful on this point.”  Roesler is Germany’s vice chancellor and head of the Free
Democratic Party, Merkel’s junior coalition ally.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
