Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
will review the use of a 60 percent rate to calculate the oil
export tax each month, which is 5 percentage points lower than
the current rate, Vedomosti said today, citing people it didn’t
identify.  The government isn’t setting the 60 percent rate in law,
while Putin signed an order unifying the export tax on refined
products at 66 percent of the crude duty, part of the so-called
60-66 measure, the newspaper said.  Russia now taxes crude exports using a 65 percent rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
