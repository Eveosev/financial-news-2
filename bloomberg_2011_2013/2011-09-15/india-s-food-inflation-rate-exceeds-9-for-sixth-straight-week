India ’s food inflation rate
exceeded 9 percent for a sixth straight week, maintaining
pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates  tomorrow.  An index measuring wholesale prices of farm products
including rice and wheat rose 9.47 percent in the week ended
Sept. 3 from a year earlier, the commerce ministry said in New
Delhi today. It gained 9.55 percent the previous week.  The  Reserve Bank of India  will probably raise rates by a
quarter of a percentage point at tomorrow’s policy meeting,
according to 12 of 13 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao has to weigh the risks to expansion
posed by a faltering global recovery against price pressures,
which may be stoked by a weaker rupee.  “There are concerns on the global economic front, but
inflation still remains the primary concern for the RBI,”
Suvodeep Rakshit, an economist at Kotak Securities Ltd. in
Mumbai, said before the report.  He expects the  Reserve Bank  to increase its repurchase rate
by a quarter of a percentage point to 8.25 percent tomorrow.  The  Indian rupee , which has weakened 6.6 percent this
quarter, fell 0.4 percent to 47.86 against the dollar at 11:53
a.m. in Mumbai. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index
dropped 0.2 percent. The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due
April 2021 gained one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
8.35 percent.  India’s benchmark wholesale-price inflation accelerated to
a 13-month high of 9.78 percent in August, the government said
yesterday.  Onion prices climbed 43 percent in the week through Sept. 3
from a year earlier, contributing to food inflation, today’s
report showed. Potato prices increased 21 percent while
vegetable costs gained 17.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
