Denmark’s central bank cut two of
its  interest rates  after the krone strengthened as international
investors sought alternatives to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Nationalbanken lowered its certificate of deposit rate to 1
percent from 1.1 percent and its current account rate to 0.9
percent from 1 percent, the Copenhagen-based bank said today in
a statement. It left its benchmark lending rate unchanged at
1.55 percent.  Denmark adjusts rates to keep its currency pegged within a
2.25 percent band to the euro. On Aug. 25, Nationalbanken also
cut the deposit and current account rates by 0.1 percentage
point, citing a stronger krone. Eight days later, the bank said
its foreign currency reserves jumped to a record 475.7 billion
kroner ($90.9 billion) as it sold kroner to weaken the currency.  “The Danish krone is strong against the euro and the
central bank has in the past weeks probably bought foreign
currency to weaken the krone,” Sydbank A/S Chief Economist
Jacob Graven said today in a note to clients, predicting the
cut. “The possibility of a Danish rate cut shows that
fundamentally investors have a large degree of trust in
 Denmark ’s economy.”  The central bank doesn’t hold scheduled meetings and can
change its rates at any time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
