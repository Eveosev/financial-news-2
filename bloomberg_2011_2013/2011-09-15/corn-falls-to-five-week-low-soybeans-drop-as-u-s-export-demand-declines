Corn prices dropped to a five-week
low and soybeans fell, capping the longest slump in five weeks,
after a government report showed export demand declined in the
U.S., the world’s top producer.  Export sales  of corn in the year that began Sept. 1 fell
9.6 percent to 14.4 million metric tons from a year earlier, and
soybeans slumped 20 percent, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today. The agency has forecast that corn shipments will
fall to the lowest in nine years and soybean sales will drop to
a three-year low.  “There’s a transition taking place from the focus on
falling production to one of faltering demand,”  Dave Marshall ,
a farm-marketing adviser at Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in
Nashville,  Illinois , said today in a telephone interview. “U.S.
export customers are turning to cheaper sources of feed wheat to
replace corn and buying more South American soybeans.”  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 23.25 cents, or
3.2 percent, to close at $7.01 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest drop in two weeks. Earlier,
the price touched $7.0025, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Aug. 11. Still, the grain has risen 17 percent since July
1 as hot, dry weather reduced U.S. yields.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 24 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $13.5875 a bushel on the CBOT, dropping for the
fourth straight day, after touching $13.565, the lowest since
Aug. 19.  Prices also fell on speculation that overnight frost and
freezing weather from  North Dakota  to  Wisconsin  did not severely
damage U.S. crops, Marshall said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
