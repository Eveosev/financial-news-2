Horst Reichenbach, who heads a
European Union task force helping  Greece  with taxation issues
and modernizing its bureaucracy, said a priority for the EU was
to help Greece cope with budgetary challenges.  “Greece needs a better tax collection system and we will
help to implement this,” Reichenbach told reporters at a press
conference in  Athens  today. “The Greek authorities have already
worked on this with the  International Monetary Fund  and there is
a large degree of agreement.”  The force will work with authorities on ways to improve
absorption of EU structural funds for use in industries for
development, such as tourism, alternative energy and food
processing, especially given the lack of liquidity in the
banking sector, he said.  Greek ministers are aware of the challenges and “I’m
convinced that by common efforts we can make progress to help
Greece make it and there’s determination to do so on both the
Greek and European sides,” Reichenbach said. “There is
enormous political will in Greece and political will at the
European level to keep Greece in the  euro zone .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
