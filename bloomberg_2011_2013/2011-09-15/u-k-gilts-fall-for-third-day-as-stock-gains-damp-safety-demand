U.K. 10-year gilts fell for a third
day as stocks advanced and the  European Central Bank  said it
would coordinate with its counterparts to lend dollars to euro-
area banks, damping demand for the safest assets.  The 10-year yield climbed to the highest level in two weeks
as the Bank of  England  said inflation expectations rose to the
highest level in three years, and a government report showed
retail sales dropped in August less than economists had
forecast. The pound rose against the dollar and the yen.  The decline in gilts “is a function of risk appetite
coming back to the fore,” said  Matteo Regesta , a senior
interest-rate strategist in London at BNP Paribas SA. “It’s the
usual negative correlation with risky assets.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt climbed eight basis points to
2.52 percent at 4:48 p.m. in  London , after earlier rising to
2.59 percent, the highest level since Sept. 1. The 3.75 percent
bond due September 2021 fell 0.720, or 7.20 pounds per 1,000-
pound ($1,385) face amount, to 110.780. The two-year yield was
little changed at 0.55 percent.  The ECB said it will conduct three U.S. dollar liquidity-
providing operations in coordination with the  Federal Reserve ,
the Bank of England, the Bank of  Japan  and the Swiss National
Bank. It will offer the loans on Oct. 12, Nov. 9 and Dec. 7.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  of shares gained for a third day,
advancing 2.2 percent.  Inflation Outlook  U.K. consumers expect prices to increase 4.2 percent over
the next year, the  Bank of England  said in a quarterly survey
published in London. That’s up from a reading of 3.9 percent in
May. Retail sales including fuel declined 0.2 percent from July,
the Office for National Statistics said. The median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.3 percent decrease.  Gilts have returned 2.9 percent this month, compared with
2.1 percent for German government bonds and 1.1 percent for U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.5807, ending a five-day
declined, and appreciated 0.4 percent to 121.28 yen. It weakened
0.6 percent to 87.71 pence per euro.  Sterling has fallen 6.5 percent in the past 12 months
against a basket of nine major peers, the second-worst performer
after the dollar, which fell 7.6 percent, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
