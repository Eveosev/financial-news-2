TNK-BP, the Russian oil venture
owned by  BP Plc (BP/)  and a group of billionaires, plans to invest $45
billion in exploration and production over the next decade to
increase output.  The company will increase output by 1 percent to 2 percent
a year, said Stan Miroshnik, TNK-BP executive vice president for
strategy and business development. It also plans to expand
projects outside of  Russia  to add 110,000 barrels to 247,000
barrels of oil and gas output a day in the period.  “These projects will require the introduction of new
technology, development of new regions and significant
investment,” Miroshnik said in Moscow today. “We are striving
to increase the company’s profitability and market value and
become a major international player.”  TNK-BP, based in Moscow, is looking for opportunities in
Africa, the  Middle East  and  Latin America  to diversify
operations from Russia,  Brazil , Vietnam and Venezuela. BP and
the billionaire shareholders have been debating expansion
strategy after two corporate conflicts in four years.  The company also plans to invest $2.5 billion in refining
projects and $1.5 billion in marketing operations, Miroshnik
said.  TNK-BP plans to increase gas extraction to 35 billion cubic
meters in 2020 accounting for about 22 percent of total
production, up 10 percentage points from its share now. The
share of oil extracted in Western Siberia will drop to about 20
percent from 50 percent now, while new projects in the Yamal
region in the Arctic will account for 27 percent of total output
in 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
