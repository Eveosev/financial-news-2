Del Monte  Food Co. will spend 1.7
billion shillings ($18 million) over the next three years
boosting juice output at its plant in Kenya to protect market
share, Business Daily said.  The funds will be used to expand the company’s fruit
plantation and production capacity, and on marketing, the
Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing Linda Conway, vice
president of Fresh Delmonte. The company plans to expand in the
regional market, it said.  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , the world’s largest soft-drink maker,
announced plans in May to spend $62 million over three years
boosting capacity in Kenya.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
