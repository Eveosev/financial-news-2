Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-run oil producer, said it may sell bonds in reais to help
finance the world’s largest oil-industry spending plan.  “The real is strong and the dollar is weak,” making a
local-currency issue more attractive, Chief Executive Officer
Jose Sergio Gabrielli told reporters today in Rio de Janeiro.
Brazil’s real has rallied 35 percent against the  U.S. dollar 
since the start of 2009.  Petrobras’s borrowing capacity hasn’t been affected by the
sovereign-debt crisis in Europe because the company has
attractive projects, Gabrielli said. Petrobras needs to raise as
much as $90 billion over the next five years to help finance
$224.7 billion in investments. The company plans to more than
double production in the next 10 years.  “There’s no lack of money in the market,” Gabrielli said.
“If you have good projects, you get the funds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
