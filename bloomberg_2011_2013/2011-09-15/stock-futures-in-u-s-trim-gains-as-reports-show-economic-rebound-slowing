U.S. stock-index futures trimmed
gains after reports showed jobless claims unexpectedly rose and
manufacturing in the  New York  area shrank more than forecast,
adding to signs the economic rebound is slowing.     Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December rose 0.1 percent to 1,183.9 at 8:33 a.m. New York time
after climbing 0.7 percent earlier. Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures were up 17 points, or 0.2 percent, at 11,191.  Jobless claims  climbed by 11,000 to 428,000 in the week
ended Sept. 10 that included the Labor Day holiday, figures from
the Labor Department showed today in Washington. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a drop in claims to
411,000, according to the median forecast.  The Federal Reserve Bank  of New York’s general economic
index dropped to minus 8.8, the weakest reading since November,
from minus 7.7 in August. Economists projected an increase to
minus 4, based on the median of 54 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey. Readings less than zero signal companies in the so-
called Empire State Index, which covers New York, northern  New
Jersey , and southern Connecticut, are cutting back.  The S&P 500 climbed 1.4 percent yesterday as French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said they are “convinced” Greece will remain in the euro area.
The gauge of U.S. equities has lost 5.5 percent this year after
plunging 18 percent between the end of April and Aug. 8. The
index has since rebounded 6.2 percent.  Pessimism about U.S. stocks among newsletter writers
increased to its highest point since March 2009, when the last
 bear market  ended, spurring speculation equities will rebound.  The share of bearish publications tracked by Investors
Intelligence rose to 40.9 percent from 37.6 percent a week
earlier, according to a report from the researcher yesterday.
When the proportion was last this high, the  S&P 500  started a
bull market rally that produced gains of as much as 102 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
