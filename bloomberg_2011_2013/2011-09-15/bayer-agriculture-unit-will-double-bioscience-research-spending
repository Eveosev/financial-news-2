Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s agriculture unit will
double its spending on bioscience research to 400 million euros
($500.4 million) by 2015 as part of a growth plan announced
today.  The CropScience unit will increase total research and
development spending by about 20 percent to more than 850
million euros, division head Sandra Peterson said in a
statement. Meanwhile, the Leverkusen, Germany-based drugs and
chemicals maker said it will stop selling class-one insecticides
by the end of next year.  The company expects sales of seeds, traits and crop
protection products for fruits and vegetables to rise to about 3
billion euros by 2020, Peterson said. The segment represented
about 25 percent of the unit’s 6.83 billion in sales last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
