India ’s 10-year bonds advanced for
the first time in three days on speculation the central bank
will halt interest rate increases after boosting borrowing costs
tomorrow.  Yields fell after Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said
today inflation may have reached a peak in August. The  Reserve
Bank  of India may boost the repurchase rate by 25 basis points
to 8.25 percent, according to 12 of 13 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. One expects no change. This will probably be the last
rate increase in the “current cycle”, said  Roy Paul , deputy
general manager of treasury at  Federal Bank Ltd. (FB)   “Investors are adding to their holdings as they expect the
tone of the policy to be less hawkish this time around,”
Mumbai-based Paul said. “Bonds may rally as a 25 basis point
increase in rate is already factored in.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.33 percent at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  The central bank has raised borrowing costs 11 times since
the start of 2010 as inflation stayed above 8 percent for 20
months.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose seven basis points to 7.74 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
