Carmakers and suppliers are in
talks about combined purchasing for some scarce raw materials in
an effort to secure supply,  Financial Times Deutschland said ,
citing  Thomas Weber , head of development at  Daimler AG. (DAI)   Talks are at an early stage and there is no set schedule or
details of what form the cooperation would take, Weber said,
according to the German newspaper. There are shortages of some
rare earth materials used in the making of hybrid and electric
vehicles after  China  limited exports, the newspaper said.  Purchasing cooperation may also be attractive to an
industrial company such as  Siemens AG (SIE) , which needs rare earth
materials for high-performance magnets used in generators, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
