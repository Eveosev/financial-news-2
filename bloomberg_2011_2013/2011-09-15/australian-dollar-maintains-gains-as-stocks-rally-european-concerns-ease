Australia ’s dollar had its biggest
weekly drop versus the yen in a month before the  Reserve Bank 
releases minutes of its most-recent meeting amid speculation
policy makers will cut interest rates this year.  The Aussie declined versus most of its major peers this
week as European finance ministers met following central bank
efforts to stem the region’s debt crisis. New Zealand’s dollar
rose against the yen after a private report showed consumer
confidence fell.  “We have to be bearish on the Australian dollar in the
near term,” said Masashi Murata, vice president of foreign
exchange in  Tokyo  at BBH Investment Services Inc., a unit of New
York-based Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. “Regardless of whether
it will actually happen, the market is pricing in a rate cut,
weighing on the Aussie.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.7 percent 79.78 yen as of 12:11
p.m. in  New York  from 79.21 yen yesterday. The Aussie was at
$1.0377 from $1.0328 in New York yesterday. New Zealand’s dollar
rose 0.9 percent to 83.11 U.S. cents from 82.38 cents and
fetched 63.91 yen from 63.19.  The Australian dollar lost 1.8 percent against the yen in
the past five days, the biggest weekly slump since the precio
ending Aug. 12.  Central Banking  At its Sept. 6 meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia left
its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 4.75 percent, saying
global financial markets have been “very unsettled.” The rate
is higher than all of the nation’s government bond yields. The
bank will release minutes from this month’s meeting on Sept. 20.  Cash-rate futures show traders are betting RBA Governor
 Glenn Stevens  will cut rates by at least 75 basis points by
December.  The Reserve Bank of  New Zealand  yesterday left interest
rates at a record low, citing a risk that the global economy
will slow “sharply.” The ANZ National-Roy Morgan index of New
Zealand’s consumer confidence declined in September to 112.6
from 113.3 last month, Auckland-based ANZ National Bank Ltd.
said today.  Benchmark rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and 2.5
percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the U.S.
and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific nations’
higher-yielding assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
