South Korea ’s banking regulator
will take additional steps to contain  household debt  if needed,
 Financial Services Commission  Chairman Kim Seok Dong said today.  “For household debt growth, we have implemented a number
of measures to bring it under control,” Kim said in the text of
a speech. “We have made it clear that additional steps, if
needed, will be taken to achieve our goal.”  Restructuring of the nation’s distressed mutual savings
banks will pick up and there will be “no systemic risk”
arising from them, Kim said. South Korean markets are resilient
enough to deal with global shocks, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
