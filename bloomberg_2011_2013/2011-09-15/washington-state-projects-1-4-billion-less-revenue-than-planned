Washington  state said it will
collect $1.4 billion less in revenue in the current two-year
budget than was forecast in June as a slowdown in the global
economy hurts local businesses.  “Washington’s economy is benefiting from strong export
growth and hiring” at  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , said Arun Raha, executive director of the state’s Economic and Revenue
Forecast Council, at a hearing in Olympia. “These advantages to
the local economy will not weaken the drag from the national and
world economies.”  The revenue gap will create a $1.28 billion deficit in the
state’s $32 billion operating budget, said Marty Brown, director
of the Office of Financial Management.  Democratic Governor Christine Gregoire, who said she has
cut more than $10 billion from the budget over the past three
years, said she is asking agencies to prepare for additional
reductions of as much as 10 percent.  “With today’s news, it is clear that this situation will
require that we implement most of those reductions,” Gregoire
said in a statement. “The level of cuts will impact the
educational future of our children, compromise public safety and
put the most vulnerable at risk. These impacts will be felt in
communities across the state.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
