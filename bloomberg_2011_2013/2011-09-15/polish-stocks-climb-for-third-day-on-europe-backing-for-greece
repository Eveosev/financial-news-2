Poland ’s benchmark stock index rose
for a third day as commodity producers and banks advanced after
assurance from Germany and France that Greece will remain a
member of the euro.  The WIG20 Index added 1.6 percent to 2,245.64 at 12:02 p.m.
in Warsaw, trimming this week’s decline to 0.1 percent. French
President Nicolas Sarkozy and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said late yesterday they are “convinced” Greece will stay in
the euro area as they faced international calls to step up
efforts to fight the region’s debt crisis.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole copper producer, soared
4 percent to 162.8 zloty, heading for the biggest gain since
April as the price of the metal rose on reduced concern about
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and on strikes at Peruvian and
Indonesian mines.  PKN Orlen SA increased 1.4 percent to 36.21 zloty, rising
for a second time this week as Wood & Co. raised its
recommendation for Poland’s biggest oil company to “buy” and
crude oil prices increased.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , Poland’s second-largest lender, rose 2.8
percent to 134.4 zloty, erasing earlier losses and heading for a
third daily gain. Italy’s UniCredit SpA, its majority owner,
said Finanza & Mercati’s report today that it’s studying asset
sales including Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS in Turkey and Pekao in
Poland is “completely groundless.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
