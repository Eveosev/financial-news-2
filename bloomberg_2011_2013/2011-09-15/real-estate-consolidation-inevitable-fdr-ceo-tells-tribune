Real-estate industry consolidation
is “inevitable,” according to Christophe Kullmann, the chief
executive officer of  Fonciere des Regions (FDR)  SA, La Tribune
reported, citing an interview.  The company, which abandoned an offer for  Fonciere Paris
France (FPF)  SA this month, will start looking at new opportunities
once markets stabilize, Kullman told the newspaper.  Fonciere des Regions is “relatively confident” about 2011
and 2012, though rental activity is at risk of deteriorating if
financial-market panic continues, Kullman said, according to La
Tribune.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
