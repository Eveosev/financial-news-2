Greece’s unemployment rate rose to
a record in the second quarter as the government’s austerity
measures deepened the recession, raising the pressure on Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  to meet budget targets.  The jobless rate rose to 16.3 percent, or 810,821 people,
from 15.9 percent in the first quarter and 11.8 percent a year
earlier, the  Hellenic Statistical Service  said in an e-mailed
statement today in  Athens . That’s the highest since the
introduction of quarterly data going back to 1998.  The growing number of unemployed is raising the political
cost of Papandreou’s budget cuts as he tries to secure
additional European Union and International Monetary Fund aid
following a 110 billion-euro ($155 billion) bailout last year.
Investor skittishness about Papandreou’s ability to push through
the cuts to secure the funds and avert default have roiled
markets worldwide.  Germany and  France  signaled yesterday they’re ready to keep
supporting Greece after Papandreou pledged to stick to a target
of a deficit of 17.1 billion euros this year and 14.9 billion
euros in 2012. The Greek Cabinet this month endorsed measures to
help cover a 2 billion-euro shortfall for this year that has
been exacerbated by the deepening recession.  Steady Increase  The quarterly jobless rate has risen for eight straight
quarters, Bloomberg data show, beginning its upward trajectory
in the third quarter of 2009, before Papandreou was elected.  One in five women was unemployed, compared with 13.7
percent for men. The rate was 28.6 percent for men and 38.3
percent for women between 15 and 29.  Almost half of the unemployed in the country have been
without work for a year or more, according to the statement.
Unemployment was highest in the northern regions of East
Macedonia and Thrace, at 20.7 percent and West Macedonia, at
23.1 percent.  The slumping economy has prevented  Greece  from reaching
deficit targets, as the fiscal gap closed at 10.5 percent of
gross domestic product last year, exceeding the goal of 9.5
percent.  Greece’s central-government shortfall widened 22 percent in
the first eight months of 2011 as the economy shrank and revenue
fell. The gap, which excludes outlays by state-owned
institutions and companies, increased to 18.1 billion euros from
14.8 billion euros a year earlier, preliminary data from the
Athens-based  Finance Ministry  showed this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
