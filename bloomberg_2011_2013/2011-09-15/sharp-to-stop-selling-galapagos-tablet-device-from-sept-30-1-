Sharp Corp.,  Japan ’s largest maker
of liquid-crystal displays, said it will stop selling its
Galapagos tablet device and won’t take orders after Sept. 30.  The company will continue to ship a version of the tablet
model, which it began to offer at the end of August to broadband
service provider  eAccess Ltd. (9427) , Osaka-based Sharp said in a
statement on its  website  today.  Sharp will end the direct sale of Galapagos almost ten
months after it introduced the device in December 2010.
Heihachiro Ochiai, a spokesman for Sharp, declined to comment on
the model’s sales.  The device derived its name from “Galapagos syndrome,” a
term that refers to the idea that Japanese technology evolved in
an isolated setting, according to Masami Ohbatake, an executive
in charge of the company’s communications business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
