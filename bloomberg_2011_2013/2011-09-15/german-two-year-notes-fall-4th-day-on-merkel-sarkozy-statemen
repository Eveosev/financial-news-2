German two-year notes slid for a
fourth day as the  European Central Bank  said it will lend
dollars to euro-region banks to ensure they have enough of the
U.S. currency, damping demand for safer assets.  Ten-year bund yields climbed above 2 percent for the first
time since Sept. 5 as stocks gained after French President
Nicolas Sarkozy and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
yesterday they’re “convinced” Greece will remain in the
currency union. Greek bonds surged as investors trimmed bets the
nation will default. Spain’s 10-year yields approached a one-
month high after the country sold 3.95 billion euros ($5.4
billion) of debt.  “It shows that the central banks are being preemptive with
respect to the dollar-funding situation,” said Niels From,
chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “This is
supportive for the financial sector and calms some of the
tensions,” reducing demand for bunds, he said.  Two-year German yields increased five basis points to 0.61
percent as of 3:55 p.m. in  London . The 0.75 percent security due
in 2013 fell 0.100, or 1 euro per $1,000 euro ($1,388) face
amount, to 100.270. Ten-year rates rose six basis points to 1.94
percent, after reaching 2.002 percent.  The ECB said it will conduct three U.S. dollar liquidity-
providing operations in coordination with the  Federal Reserve ,
the Bank of  England , the Bank of  Japan  and the Swiss National
Bank. European stocks and the euro rallied. It will offer the
loans on Oct. 12, Nov. 9 and Dec. 7.  All-Time Low  German 10-year yields have dropped more than 90 basis
points in the past three months, touching an all-time low 1.68
percent on Sept. 13, as investors sought the relative safety of
top-rated  government securities  on signs the European debt
crisis was deepening.  Sarkozy and Merkel signaled they’re ready to keep
supporting  Greece  following a telephone discussion with Greek
Prime Minister George Papandreou yesterday. Papandreou committed
to meet deficit-reduction targets demanded as a condition for
further bailouts, according to the statements distributed by the
governments in Athens, Berlin and Paris.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index advanced 2 percent and the euro
strengthened 0.7 percent to $1.3857.  Greek two-year note yields dropped 11.17 percentage points
to 63.32 percent after the nation said in a statement it was
“determined” to meet all its commitments.  Joaquin Almunia , vice president of the European Commission,
said Europe’s leaders will implement the Greek bailout plan they
adopted in July, along with the necessary logistical details, to
ease financial-market tensions.  Spain  Sale  Spain sold about 1.5 billion euros of 4.85 percent bonds
due in October 2020 at an average yield of 5.156 percent,
compared with 5.20 percent at the previous auction of the same
securities on Feb. 17. Demand increased to 1.99 times the amount
on offer from 1.54 times.  “The auction results were pretty decent,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate
& Investment Bank in London. “The average yield is close enough
to the 5 percent level not to concern the market about the level
Spain is funding at. All these bonds were taps of lines which it
seemed the ECB had been buying.”  Spanish 10-year yields increased four basis points to 5.40
percent after reaching 5.44 percent, matching the highest since
Aug. 8. Two-year yields were little changed at 3.75 percent.  ECB Buying  The ECB began purchasing Spanish and Italian bonds on Aug.
8 to curb a surge in yields, according to people with knowledge
of the transactions, who declined to be identified because the
deals are confidential.  France  sold 2.34 billion euros of 2 percent notes due in
September 2013 at an average yield of 1.08 percent, down from
1.60 percent at the prior auction on July 21. Investors bid for
2.66 times the amount on offer, compared with 2.78 at the
previous sale. The nation also sold debt due in 2014 and 2016,
and inflation-linked bonds.  German  government bonds  have returned 7.4 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Greek bonds lost
43 percent and Spain’s debt gained 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
