Great Wall Motor Co.,  China ’s
biggest pickup truck maker, said it will raise as much as 4.26
billion yuan ($666 million) in its Shanghai share sale, more
than the company originally sought.  Great Wall will sell 304.2 million shares at 13 yuan to 14
yuan each, the company said in a statement to the  Shanghai Stock
Exchange  yesterday. The Baoding, China-based automaker had
planned to raise as much as 3.17 billion yuan, according to its
prospectus.  The maker of Hover sport-utility vehicles is raising funds
to pay for expansion amid a 12 percent slump in the benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index this year. The company said last month
it’s seeking money to accelerate project construction and boost
the output of engines, transmissions, axles and brakes, aluminum
alloy cast parts, decoration and lighting.  Great Wall is selling stock as automobile sales in China
slow from last year’s record 32 percent gain after the
government removed sales-tax breaks and rebates for rural
purchases. Total vehicle deliveries expanded 3.3 percent in the
first eight months, according to the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers.  First-half net income rose to 1.81 billion yuan from 867
million yuan last year, the company said last month in a
statement to the  Hong Kong  stock exchange. Sales gained 50
percent to 13.7 billion yuan. The stock gained 2.3 percent to
HK$10.54 in Hong Kong yesterday, before the announcement.  Hong Kong  Great Wall went public in Hong Kong in December 2003,
making it the first privately owned Chinese auto assembler
listed in the city. Its stock was 682 times oversubscribed at
the time.  The company started operations last month at a new factory
in the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin and plans to expand the
plant’s annual capacity to 200,000 units a year from an initial
50,000 units.  The automaker has been the biggest manufacturer of  pickup
trucks  in China since 1998 and started making cars in 2008,
according to its prospectus. Sales of its cars, including the
Coolbear and Voleex C30, rose 76 percent last year to 123,000
units, according to data released by the auto association.  BYD Co., the Chinese carmaker backed by  Warren Buffett ,
raised 1.42 billion yuan in its share sale in Shenzhen in June,
35 percent less than it sought. The stock has fallen 17 percent
since its debut on June 30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
