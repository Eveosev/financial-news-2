Irish emigration rose to the
highest since the 19th century in the year through April, as the
economy struggled to emerge from recession.  About 76,400 people left Ireland in the period, the  Central
Statistics Office  said in Dublin. Some 42,300 people moved to
Ireland, giving a net outflow of 34,100. The net outflow figure
fell from 34,500 in the year-earlier period.  Ireland’s economy has shrunk about 15 percent since 2007
and unemployment has tripled, after a real estate boom
collapsed. The jobless rate rose to 14.2 percent in the second
quarter from 13.9 in the first quarter, a separate report showed
today, with more than half of the unemployed a year out of work.  “The numbers of long term unemployed continues to grow,
creating a structural problem that will blight generations to
come,” said Mark Fielding, chief executive officer of Dublin-
based lobby group Irish Small and Medium Enterprises in an e-
mailed statement.  Irish payrolls dropped an annual 2 percent to 1.821 million
people in the second quarter, the statistics office said today.  While that’s the smallest decline since third quarter of
2008, companies are still cutting jobs. TalkTalk Telecom Group
Plc said on Sept. 7 it’s closing its operation in Waterford,
Ireland, and is entering into a 30-day consultation period with
the 575 workers based there.  Emigration among Irish nationals rose to 40,200 in the year
from 27,700, while emigration among non-Irish people fell for a
second year, the CSO said. While the emigration data runs back
to 1987, the statistics office said it could estimate earlier
outflows based on census figures.  Ireland’s population shrank by more than a third to 2.8
million in the 100 years through 1961, in the aftermath of the
Great Famine, which began in 1845. The population has risen to
4.58 million as of April 10, according to the statistics office.  To contact the reporters on this story:
