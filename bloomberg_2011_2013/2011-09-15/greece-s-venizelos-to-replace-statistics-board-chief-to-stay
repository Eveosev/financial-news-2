Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said board members of the independent Hellenic
Statistical Authority, or Elstat, will be replaced due to
personal differences between them affecting the operation of the
agency.  Elstat Chief Andreas Georgiou will remain at his post and
the move to remove board members isn’t related to the quality of
statistics, Venizelos told a parliamentary committee today,
according to an e-mailed transcript of his speech from the
Athens-based ministry. The changes have been agreed with
 Greece ’s partners and Eurostat, he said.  “The problems at Elstat are not of substance,” Venizelos
said. “They don’t have to do with the collection, analysis or
dissemination of the data. Unfortunately on the level of
personal relations and operation there is a problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
