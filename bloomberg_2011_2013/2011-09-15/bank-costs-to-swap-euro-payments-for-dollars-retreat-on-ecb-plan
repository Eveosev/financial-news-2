The premium European banks pay to
borrow in dollars through the swaps markets decreased after the
 European Central Bank  said it will lend euro-area banks dollars
to ensure they have enough of the U.S. currency through yearend.  The cost of converting euro-based payments into dollars, as
measured by the three-month cross-currency  basis swap , fell 5.28
basis points to 93.13 basis points below the euro interbank
offered rate, or Euribor, as of 2:17 p.m. in London, indicating
a lower premium to buy the greenback, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The one-year basis swap dropped 3.8 basis points to 66.75
basis points. Basis swaps allow banks to borrow in one currency,
while simultaneously lending in another.  To contact the reporter on this story:
