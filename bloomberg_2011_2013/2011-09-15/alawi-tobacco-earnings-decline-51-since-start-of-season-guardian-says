Malawiâ€™s tobacco earnings declined
51 percent from the start of the selling season to Sept. 9,
compared with a year earlier, the Guardian reported, citing
Tobacco Control Commission spokesman Juliana Chidumu.  The southern African nation has earned $186 million from
155 million kilograms (342 million pounds) of tobacco sold, the
Blantyre-based newspaper cited Munthali as saying. This compared
with $376 million from 191 million kilograms for the same period
in 2010, it said.  The selling season started on March 14 and will close at
the end of November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
