Malaysia ’s ringgit was set for its
biggest weekly loss since May 2010 as concern over  Europe ’s debt
crisis and the faltering U.S. economic recovery damped demand
for emerging-market assets.  The ringgit traded near its lowest level this year even
after German and French leaders said they were convinced that
Greece will remain in the euro zone. Retail sales in the U.S.
unexpectedly stagnated in August while inventories rose less
than forecast in July, indicating companies are bracing for a
slowdown in demand, according to data released by the Commerce
Department yesterday. Markets in Malaysia will be closed for a
public holiday tomorrow.  “It’s the European debt crisis and concerns over the  U.S.
economy  that are weighing heavily on emerging-market assets such
as the ringgit,” said Calbert Loh, head of treasury at Bangkok
Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Sentiment is unlikely to reverse
until there are positive signals.”  The ringgit fell 0.8 percent to 3.0975 per dollar as of
4:21 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency dropped 2.9 percent in the week, the
biggest loss since May 2010, when it slumped 3.5 percent.  The reading for retail sales in the U.S. was unchanged
following a 0.3 percent rise for July that was smaller than
previously estimated, according to data released by the Commerce
Department yesterday in  Washington . Another report showed
inventories rose 0.4 percent in July, less than the median 0.5
percent estimated in a Bloomberg News survey.  Malaysian  government bonds  retreated. The yield on the
4.262 percent note due September 2016 rose 11 basis points
today, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.44 percent, according to
Bursa Malaysia. That’s the most since June 6, when the notes
surged 62 basis points. The yield rose 19 basis points in the
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
