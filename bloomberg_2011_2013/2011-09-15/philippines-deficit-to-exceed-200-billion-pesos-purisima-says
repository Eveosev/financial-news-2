 The  Philippines  expects this
year’s budget deficit to exceed 200 billion pesos as the
government accelerates spending, Finance Secretary Cesar
Purisima told lawmakers during a budget hearing today.  The shortfall in the first seven months was 43.7 billion
pesos, less than 20 percent of the level a year earlier, the
government reported last month. Infrastructure investment along
with overseas remittances, tourism and agriculture will help
boost growth in the next 24 months, Purisima said in  Manila .  To contact the reporter on this story:
