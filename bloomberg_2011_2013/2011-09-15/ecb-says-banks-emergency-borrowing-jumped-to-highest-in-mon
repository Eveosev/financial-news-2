The  European Central Bank  said
emergency overnight loans to commercial banks jumped to the
highest in more than a month at the start of its latest
maintenance period.  Euro-area banks tapped the ECB’s marginal lending facility
for 3.4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) at 2.25 percent yesterday,
the Frankfurt-based central bank said today. That’s the most
since Aug. 10. Banks deposited 87 billion euros with the ECB
overnight, up from 75.5 billion euros the previous day.  Yesterday was the first day of the ECB’s maintenance
period, during which banks need to hold a certain amount of
reserves on average. This results in fluctuations at the
beginning and end of the period as some lenders front-load their
borrowing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
