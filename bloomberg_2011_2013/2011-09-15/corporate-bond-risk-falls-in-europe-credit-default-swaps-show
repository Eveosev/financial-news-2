The cost of insuring European
sovereign and corporate debt extended declines after the
 European Central Bank  said it will lend dollars to euro-area
banks and as the prospect of default by  Greece  receded.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps tied
to 15 governments dropped 16 basis points to 327 as of 4:25 p.m.
in London, the lowest since Sept. 9 and signaling an improvement
in perceptions of  credit quality . Swaps on  France  fell 11 basis
points to 170, contracts on Italy dropped 21 basis points to 450
and  Spain  fell 20 basis points to 372, CMA prices show.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it will coordinate with the
Fed and other central banks to ensure euro-region lenders have
enough of the U.S. currency through the end of the year. Credit
markets also improved after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said yesterday they’re
“convinced” Greece will stay in the euro area.  The central banks have given lenders “time to adjust their
funding and adjust their assets to respond to the change in
availability of dollar funding from private sector sources,”
said Roger Francis, an analyst at Mizuho International Plc in
London.  The premium European banks pay to borrow in dollars through
the swaps markets fell. The cost of converting euro-based
payments into dollars, as measured by the three-month cross-
currency  basis swap , shrank to 80.25 basis points below the euro
interbank offered rate, from as much as 112.6 basis points Sept.
12. The one-year basis swap fell seven basis points to 63.80.  The central banks acted after U.S. money market funds cut
dollar loans for European banks on concern the institutions may
face funding problems as the sovereign-debt crisis escalates.  Bank Risk Falls  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 10.25 basis points to 173.75. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the senior debt of 25
banks and insurers dropped 24 basis points to 261, the lowest
since Sept. 8, while the subordinated index was down 45.5 basis
points at 472.  Contracts on UBS AG fell, reversing an earlier increase
when  Switzerland ’s biggest bank said it may post a third-quarter
loss after unauthorized trading at its investment bank cost it
about $2 billion.  Contracts insuring the lender’s senior bonds fell 12 basis
points to 198, while those on its subordinated notes dropped 15
basis points to 322, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 27 basis points to
714, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 5 p.m. in London.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
