The Slovenian stock exchange will
offer companies that list shares in Ljubljana the opportunity to
have a secondary listing on the Vienna bourse.  Major listed companies in Slovenia “would double-list on
the Vienna Stock Exchange,” Andrej Sketa, president of the
management board of the Ljubljana bourse, said in a statement
today. “Such an alignment would give Slovenian investment firms
and investors new opportunities and offer Slovenian listed
companies straightforward access to foreign investors.”  The plan is likely to be implemented at the start of next
year, he said.  The Ljubljana stock exchange, which last year became part
of the CEE Stock Exchange Group AG of  Austria , has been
struggling with low liquidity with some companies like Nova
Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d. seeking a secondary listing in
Warsaw to lure investors.  Appliance maker Gorenje Group d.d., drugmaker Krka d.d. and
the insurer Zavarovalnica Triglav d.d. have said they may follow
Nova Kreditna to Warsaw.  The Ljubljana exchange last year introduced the Xetra
trading platform to make trading more attractive to investors
outside Slovenia.  The benchmark index of six most-traded securities lost 25
percent of its value this year. The total value of all
securities at the Ljubljana bourse amounted to 7.1 billion euros
($9.8 billion) at the end of August, according to bourse data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
