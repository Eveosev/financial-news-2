Vietnamese inflation may have
peaked in August as a result of the government’s “tight grip on
monetary and credit policy since February,”  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN)  said in a research report.  Economic growth next year may reach 5.9 percent, up from
5.8 percent this year, and down from a previous forecast for
2012 of 6.2 percent, wrote Santitarn Sathirathai, a Singapore-
based analyst at Credit Suisse, in a research note dated and
received today, and extracted from a report dated yesterday. The
global economic downturn and the lagged impact of  Vietnam ’s
tightening will weigh on growth, Santitarn wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
