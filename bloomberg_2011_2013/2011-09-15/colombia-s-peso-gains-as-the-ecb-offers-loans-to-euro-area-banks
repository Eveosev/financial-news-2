Colombia’s peso rose as the
 European Central Bank  and international policy makers
coordinated to lend dollars to euro-area banks.  The peso advanced 0.3 percent to 1,821 per dollar at 3 p.m.
New York time, from 1,826.75 yesterday. The peso is up 4.8
percent this year, the second-best performance after the Czech
koruna among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  In a bid to help tame the European debt crisis, the ECB
said today that in coordination with the U.S. Federal Reserve,
the Bank of  England , the  Bank of Japan  and the Swiss National
Bank it will conduct three U.S. dollar liquidity-providing
operations with a maturity of about three months. The loans are
in addition to the bank’s regular seven-day dollar offerings,
the ECB said in a statement.  “The news is injecting some optimism to the market,” said
Nicolas Bernal, an analyst at Ultrabursatiles SA brokerage in
Bogota. Still, “investors remain on the cautious side which is
why we will probably see stability in markets more than big
gains.”  The yield on  Colombia ’s 10 percent benchmark bonds due in
July 2024 rose 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.35
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
