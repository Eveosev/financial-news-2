Poland ’s central bank and the
government, acting through euro sales by state-owned Bank
Gospodarstwa Krajowego, are keeping recent declines in the zloty
“under control,” Elzbieta Chojna-Duch of the Monetary Policy
Council said today in an interview on TVN CNBC.  Economic growth will definitely slow next year, requiring
the government to revise down its 2012 budget forecast of 4
percent annual growth, Chojna-Duch said. Economic expansion of
about 3.5 percent next year would be “optimal,” she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
