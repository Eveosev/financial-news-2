United Co. Rusal expects to save
about $120 million in interest payments after completing debt
refinancing talks this month, Deputy Chief Executive Officer
Oleg Mukhamedshin said.  Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum maker, is “on track”
to complete debt refinancing with all its lenders by the end of
September, which will cut the overall debt cost, Mukhamedshin
said today in an interview with Linzie Janis on Bloomberg
Television’s “Countdown.”  “The overall cost of our debt post refinancing will be
slightly above 4 percent per annum,” Mukhamedshin said. “And
we expect about $120 million of savings on the  interest rate  in
the next 12 months.”  Rusal in 2009 undertook Russia’s biggest corporate debt
restructuring as the global crash in commodity prices coincided
with the company’s increased borrowing to finance expansion.
Rusal is now refinancing the debt as its earnings improve. Net
debt dropped to $11.4 billion as of June 30, compared with $12.2
billion a year earlier and almost $17 billion in 2008.  Rusal last month hired banks including BNP Paribas SA and
ING Groep NV to arrange a $4.75 billion loan to refinance debt
to international lenders. The amount may be increased to no more
than $5 billion, Rusal said Aug. 29.  The loan will be split into two tranches of as much as
$4.25 billion and as much as $1 billion. The rate will be no
more than 285 basis points above the three-month London
interbank offered rate on the first tranche and fixed at 3.85
percent for the second, Rusal’s interim report  shows .  OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest lender, agreed to refinance
$460 million of debt for 4.5 percent above the one-year London
interbank offered rate, Rusal said in a presentation  last month .
A $655 million loan with OAO Gazprombank will have interest of
4.5 percent above three-month Libor. Both loans will mature in
2016, according to the presentation.  Talks with VTB Group, Russia’s second-largest bank, are at
an “advanced stage,” Mukhamedshin said last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
