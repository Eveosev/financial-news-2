Tanzania’s shilling strengthened
for a second day against the dollar as tourists increased supply
of the greenback.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy gained
as much as 0.8 percent to 1,624.5 per dollar, and traded less
than 0.1 percent stronger at 1,637.5 by 12:45 p.m in Dar es
Salaam, the commercial capital.  “Inflows of dollars have come in from the tourism sector
today, which helped the shilling to slightly gain against the
dollar,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of
Commerce, Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone from
Dar es Salaam.  Tourism’s total contribution to the country’s gross
domestic product is expected to increase to 13.4 percent of GDP
by 2021 from 12.9 percent now, the  World Travel & Tourism
Council  said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
