Benchmark European coal advanced
the most in more than two weeks.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp with settlement next year rose 85 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $126.75 a metric ton at 10:45 a.m. in  London , according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the biggest gain since
Aug. 31.  Bloomberg tracks data from information supplied by ICAP
