Australia ’s second-quarter mineral
and energy commodity export earnings rose 12 percent from the
previous three months, lead by surging demand for coal,
according to the nation’s commodity forecaster.  Sales were A$45.2 billion ($46.4 billion) in the three
months to June 30, the  Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics ,
said today in a report. The bureau is an independent economic
and statistical research unit within the Department of Resources,
Energy and Tourism that commenced operation on July 1. The
quarterly reports were previously published by the Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences.  Australia posted its second-highest export earnings in the
quarter, underpinned by a 37 percent gain for coking coal to
A$7.4 billion, a 21 percent gain in thermal coal to A$3.6
billion, and a 23 percent increase for crude oil and other
refinery feedstock to A$3.2 billion.  Iron ore  remained the
biggest revenue raiser, reaping A$14.1 billion, up 7 percent.  For the year to June 30, resources and energy exports
surged 27 percent to a record A$175 billion, the bureau said.
Export values were partly offset by the strength of the
Australian dollar, it said in an e-mailed statement.  “The record level of resource and energy export earnings
in 2010-2011 reflects higher prices for the majority of
commodities important to the Australian  mining industry ,
including coal, iron ore, crude oil, liquefied natural gas, gold
and base metals,” the bureau’s chief economist, Quentin Grafton,
said in the statement. “Mine production for iron ore, gold and
base metals increased.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
