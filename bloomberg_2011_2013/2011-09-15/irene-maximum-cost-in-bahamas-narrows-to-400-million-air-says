Hurricane Irene will cost insurers
$200 million to $400 million to cover losses in the Bahamas,
catastrophe risk-modeler AIR Worldwide said, lowering its
estimate from a maximum of $700 million in expenses.  The revision is based on a review of the types of coverage
purchased in the area, the Boston-based firm said in a statement
on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
