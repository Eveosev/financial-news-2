U.S. 10-year notes have become less
in demand in the short-term market for borrowing and lending
Treasuries since the government auctioned $21 billion of the
debt this week.  Traders in the repurchase-agreement, or repo, market that
want to borrow the Treasuries in the greatest demand -- those
known as “on special” -- are willing to lend money overnight in
exchange for them at rates below those on other U.S. securities.
The overnight rate for the current 10-year note closed Sept. 8
at negative 2.89 percent, according to GovPX Inc., a unit of
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The current 10-year, the 2.125 percent security due in
August 2021, the supply of which the government almost doubled
with an auction on Aug. 13, closed today at 0.02 percent after
opening at 0.05 percent. The Treasury Department sold an initial
$24 billion of the maturity on Aug. 10.  “The reissuance of 10-year note supply has flooded the
street with 10-year notes, so pressure eased and repo rates
backed up as a result,” said Ray Abbiatici, who works with repo
and money markets at NewEdge USA LLC in New York.  Securities dealers use repos to finance holdings and
increase leverage. Securities that can be borrowed at  interest
rates  close to the  Federal Reserve ’s target rate, which now is
in a range of zero to 0.25  percent, are called general
collateral.  Yields on 10-year notes climbed 10 basis points today, or
0.10 percentage point, to 2.08 percent in New York, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They increased as much as 13 basis
points, the most since Aug. 24, to 2.12 percent, after touching
a record low 1.8770 percent on Sept. 12.  The Sept. 13 10-year auction was one of three note and bond
offerings this week totaling $66 billion. It drew a record low
yield of 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
