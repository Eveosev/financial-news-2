Denmark’s banks won’t face an extra
6 billion kroner ($1.1 billion) in taxes targeted by the
opposition because most lawmakers would block such a proposal,
Danske Bank A/S Chief Executive Officer  Peter Straarup  said.  The Social Democrat-led opposition, which will win today’s
national election according to all polls conducted since the
vote was called last month, has said it wants banks to foot the
bill for extra spending on schools and hospitals. The bloc,
which also comprises the Social Liberals, is split on economic
policy over key issues such as pensions and taxes.  “I’m not overly concerned,” Straarup said at a conference
hosted by UBS AG today in  Stockholm . “They will have to rely on
the Social Liberal Party, which has a very healthy view on
taxation, and there is no way they will be able to do this. That
is my assessment.”  Danske Bank covered a third of the total costs related to
winding down failed lenders since 2008, including Amagerbanken
A/S in February and Fjordbank Mors A/S in June. The Social
Democrats, led by Helle Thorning-Schmidt, also want to introduce
a tax on securities transactions.  Such a plan would “lower turnover and distort liquidity,”
Straarup said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
