Estonian lawmakers are due to vote
on amendments to the European Financial Stability Facility this
month, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said today.  The Baltic country, which adopted the euro in January,
would guarantee as much as 1.995 billion euros ($2.78 billion)
of debt, according to a draft bill approved by the government
Sept. 8.  Parliament is expected to ratify the European Stability
Mechanism next year, Katrin Reimann said in a phone interview
from the capital, Tallinn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
