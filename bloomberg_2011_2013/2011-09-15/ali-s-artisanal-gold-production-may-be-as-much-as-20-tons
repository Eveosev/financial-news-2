Gold production by  Mali ’s
unregulated, artisanal miners may be as much as 20 metric tons
each year, according to Abdoulaye Pona, president of the
country’s Chamber of Mines.  “There are not any reliable statistics,” he said in a
statement handed to reporters in Bamako, the capital, today.
“But one can validly estimate that it is at least between 15
and 20 tons” with production taking place at as many as 400
mine sites, Pona said.  Mali vies with Tanzania to be Africa’s third-biggest gold
producer after  South Africa  and Ghana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
