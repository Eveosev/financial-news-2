Bill Neukom is retiring as managing
general partner and chief executive officer of the  San Francisco 
Giants a year after helping lead the Major League Baseball
franchise to its first World Series title in 56 years.  Neukom, 69, who previously was general counsel for
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and president of the American Bar Association,
will be replaced as CEO at the end of 2011 by Larry Baer, the
club’s president and chief operating officer.  Neukom, a Giants general partner since 2003, will serve as
chairman emeritus of the club next season, the team said today
in a statement. Baer, 54, has been COO since May 1996.  Neukom plans to focus on the World Justice Project, which
he founded in 2006 to strengthen the rule of law worldwide. He
also plans to teach at his alma mater,  Stanford Law School .  To contact the reporter on this story:
