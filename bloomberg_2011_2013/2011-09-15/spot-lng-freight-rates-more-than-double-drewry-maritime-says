Rates to ship spot, or short-term,
supplies of liquefied natural gas more than doubled in August
from a year earlier, according to Drewry Maritime Services Ltd.  Daily freight rates for spot LNG vessels rose to $95,500 in
August from $37,500 a year earlier, Pranay Shukla, a Gurgaon,
India-based analyst at the shipping consultant, said in a note.
Long-term rates climbed 11 percent to $78,000 a day.  Rates for spot charters averaged $87,875 a day this year,
compared with $40,700 in 2010, Drewry said.  The LNG tanker fleet grew to 351 vessels last month from
349 a year earlier, with an additional 61 vessels on order,
according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
