The  European Central Bank  said
threats to euro-area growth have intensified and inflation risks
have eased, signaling policy makers may take further action
should  Europe ’s debt crisis worsen.  The 17-member euro-area economy faces “particularly high
uncertainty and intensified downside risks,” the Frankfurt-
based ECB said in its monthly bulletin today, echoing President
 Jean-Claude Trichet ’s Sept. 8 policy statement. Risks to the
inflation outlook are broadly balanced and no longer tilted to
the upside, the ECB said.  The Frankfurt-based central bank last week left its
benchmark rate at 1.5 percent -- after two increases this year -
- and revised down its growth forecasts for 2011 and 2012. With
confidence in Europe’s financial institutions waning as the
sovereign debt crisis spreads, Trichet said on Sept. 12 that the
ECB has the “weaponry” to deal with banks’ liquidity needs.  “While the monetary policy stance remains accommodative,
some financing conditions have tightened,” the ECB reiterated
in today’s bulletin. “A very thorough analysis of all incoming
data and developments over the period ahead is warranted.”  The ECB on Sept. 8 cut its 2011 growth forecast to 1.6
percent from 1.9 and its 2012 projection to 1.3 percent from 1.7
percent. Inflation forecasts remain at 2.6 percent for 2011 and
1.7 percent for next year. The ECB aims to keep inflation just
below 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
