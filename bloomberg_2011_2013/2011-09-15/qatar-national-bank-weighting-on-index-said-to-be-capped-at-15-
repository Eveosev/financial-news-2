Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the
Persian Gulf country’s biggest bank by assets, may have its
weighting cut to 15 percent from 22 percent, said two bankers
familiar with the discussions.  Weightings of all companies on the  QE Index (DSM)  may be capped
at 15 percent and the decision could take effect in October,
said one of the bankers who declined to be identified because
the matter hasn’t been made public.  Qatar National Bank currently has the heaviest weighting on
the index, and is the only company that comprises more than 15
percent of the benchmark.  Qatar National Bank and the Qatar Exchange declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
