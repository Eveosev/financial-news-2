Kenya ’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar after the central bank increased its
benchmark rate to curb money supply.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.8 percent to 94.35 per dollar and was trading up
0.2 percent to 94.9 at 11:12 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital, from
yesterday’s close of 95.10.  The central  bank rate  was lifted to 7 percent from 6.25
percent, the biggest increase since the rate was introduced in
2006. Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said the bank’s “overriding
objective” is to curb inflation after earlier actions “failed
to deliver stability,” according to an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  “The shilling has strengthened as a result of the decision
to curb  money supply  by the central bank in an effort to tame
inflationary pressure,” Duncan Kinuthia a dealer at Nairobi-
based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview.  Ndung’u, 52, cut the key rate in January even as the worst
regional drought in six decades boosted inflation, triggering a
15 percent slump in the shilling against the dollar. The bank
reversed the decision two months later and restricted liquidity
to commercial lenders in a bid to shore up the currency. That
policy failed, with banks losing faith in the central bank’s
ability to manage the crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
