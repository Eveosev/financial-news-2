The Brazilian government will send
a presidential decree to Congress in the coming days reducing
taxes for local defense companies, a measure that will benefit
 Embraer SA (EMBR3)  and Odebrecht SA, Valor Economico reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  The exemption of the IPI and PIS/Cofins taxes will be
granted for a five-year period, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
