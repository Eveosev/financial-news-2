The Securities and Exchange
Commission is in “advanced” talks with  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to
settle charges related to a $1 billion mortgage-bond deal, The
Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar.  The settlement would be for more than $200 million, the
newpaper said, citing the people it didn’t identify.  The deal, called Class V Funding III, was a collateralized
debt obligation made up of other CDOs and backed by subprime
mortgages, the Journal said. It was created in 2007, the WSJ
said.  Officials are looking into whether Citigroup held any short
positions in the deal, the Journal said.  Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup,
declined to comment on the report to Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
