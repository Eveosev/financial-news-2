Google Inc. (GOOG)  reported progress in
possible settlement of a lawsuit over the search-engine
company’s digital reproduction of books, lawyers told the judge
in the case.  Daralyn Durie, a lawyer for Google, told federal judge
Denny Chin that the company has made “substantial progress” in
negotiations with publishers. Talks with representatives of
authors are taking place among “principals” from both sides,
she said.  “The parties are still talking,” Chin said in a hearing
today in  Manhattan  federal court. “I’m hopeful, still
hopeful.”  Chin set a schedule for the litigation which would result
in the case being resolved no sooner than July 2012, if the
parties don’t settle.  Google was sued in 2005 by authors and publishers who
claimed the company infringed their copyrights on a massive
scale by digitizing books and allowing snippets to be seen
online. Chin declined to approve an earlier $125 million
settlement, saying it would be unfair to authors.  Chin, who was elevated to the  New York  federal appeals
court in April 2010, is continuing as the trial judge in the
case.  The case is Authors Guild v. Google Inc., 05-CV-8136, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
