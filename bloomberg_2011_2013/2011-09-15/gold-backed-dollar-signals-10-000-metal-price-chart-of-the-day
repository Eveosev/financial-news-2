Gold has the potential to jump more
than fivefold as the precious metal’s price catches up with the
surging amount of money in the  U.S. economy , according to Dylan Grice, a global strategist at Societe Generale SA.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the price at which each  U.S.
dollar  in the monetary base, compiled by the  Federal Reserve ,
would have been backed by an ounce of gold for the past half
century. International Monetary Fund data on the country’s gold
reserves were used in the calculation.  Grice, based in  London , identified this price as the
metal’s “fair value” yesterday in a report. Since June, it has
exceeded $10,000 an ounce, as depicted in the chart’s top panel.
Gold for immediate delivery closed at $1,819.63 an ounce on the
 spot market  yesterday.  The bottom panel tracks the value of U.S. gold holdings,
based on the spot price, as a percentage of the monetary base
for the 50-year period. August’s proportion was 18 percent of
the $2.66 trillion in the economy. The latter figure was more
than triple the amount three years earlier, reflecting efforts
by the Fed to spur economic growth.  “There is a demand for an honest currency,” Grice wrote.
“The last time honesty was perceived to be so scarce -- in the
1970s gold mania -- the dollar was over-backed by gold. If it
happened then, why not again?”  U.S. gold holdings peaked at 131 percent of the monetary
base in January 1980, when spot gold climbed to $850 an ounce
after a more than 14-fold advance in the preceding decade. The
high equals about $2,330 an ounce in today’s dollars, according
to a Labor Department calculator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
