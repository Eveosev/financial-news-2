U.S. authorities may be ready to
strike a deal with  Switzerland  as a compromise in a dispute
about untaxed money in Swiss banks, Blick reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Swiss State Secretary for Financial Matters Michael Ambuehl
has in the past few days taken part in negotiations in the U.S.
that could result in American officials seeking administrative
assistance in future cases. That would mean emergency measures
or a new treaty were no longer needed  The U.S is targeting  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Julius Baer
AG, Wegelin and  Basler Kantonalbank (BSKP) , with Baer “particularly
strongly exposed,” the Swiss paper cited unidentified sources
as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
