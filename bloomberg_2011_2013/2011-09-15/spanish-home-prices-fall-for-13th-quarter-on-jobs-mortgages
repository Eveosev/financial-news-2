Spanish home prices fell for the
13th quarter as unemployment remained above 20 percent and a
reduction in mortgage lending crimped demand for property.  The average price of houses and apartments declined 6.8
percent in the three months through June from a year earlier,
the  National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said today in an e-
mailed statement. Prices dropped 1.2 percent from the previous
quarter.  Spain  is working through an excess of 700,000 new unsold
homes left over from the debt-fueled housing boom. The highest
 unemployment rate  in  Europe , at 21 percent, is curbing demand,
while banks are reining in lending amid a surge in bad loans and
higher borrowing costs.  “You can only sell in today’s market by reducing prices,
because banks are not being flexible with lending and there is
no foreseeable improvement in the unemployment rate,” said
Fernando Encinar, head of research at property website
 Idealista.com .  The number of Spanish mortgages for home purchases dropped
42 percent in June from a year earlier, the sharpest decline
since January 2009, the National Statistics Institute said on
Aug. 29. Home sales in the second quarter dropped 40.8 percent
from a year earlier, the Ministry of Public Works and Housing
said last week.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
