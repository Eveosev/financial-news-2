Ethanol futures declined to a six-
week low in  Chicago  as corn, the primary ingredient for the fuel
in the U.S., plummeted.  Prices sank for the seventh day out of eight after an
Agriculture Department report showed export sales of corn fell
9.6 percent to 14.4 million metric tons in the year that began
Sept. 1. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “The biggest thing is, we had some heavy selling in corn
today,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. “Ethanol sold off with it. We’re seeing deteriorating
demand.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 5.8 cents, or
2.1 percent, to $2.664 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Aug. 4. Futures have gained 28 percent in
the past year.  In cash market trading ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slumped 4
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.865 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive slipped 3 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.74, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 23.25 cents, or
3.2 percent, to close at $7.01 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest
drop in two weeks.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
12 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
 Illinois  is banking 15 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
