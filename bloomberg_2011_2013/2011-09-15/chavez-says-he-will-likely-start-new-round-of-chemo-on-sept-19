Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
expects not to attend a United Nations General Assembly meeting
this month in New York because of cancer treatment.  Chavez will likely begin a fourth round of chemotherapy for
an undisclosed type of cancer on Sept. 19, Chavez said yesterday
on state television.  “It’s very probable that I’ll be in chemotherapy on
Monday,” Chavez said. “Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is
finally planning to visit Venezuela after the UN meeting in New
York.”  Chavez had a baseball-sized tumor removed by doctors in
June. Between chemotherapy treatments, he is negotiating
bilateral agreements and campaigning for the presidential
election to be held next year. The former paratrooper and self-
professed socialist said he discussed funding for 137 projects
with officials from the  China  Development Bank yesterday
including railways, satellites and petrochemical plans.  Venezuela, South America’s largest OPEC oil producer, is
sending almost 400,000 barrels of oil a day to China to repay
loans and aims to eventually increase shipments to one million
barrels a day, Chavez said.  Chavez spoke after holding talks with China Development
Bank Chairman  Chen Yuan  in Caracas.  Editors: Jonathan Roeder, Mike Millard  To contact the reporters on this story:
