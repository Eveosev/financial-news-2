European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said the ECB will have to
“rethink” its bond-buying programme if euro zone members fail
to provide an appropriate rescue program, according to an
interview in Austrian radio.  The ECB’s bond-buying program was only a temporary measure
and the EFSF was supposed to step in, Nowotny said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
