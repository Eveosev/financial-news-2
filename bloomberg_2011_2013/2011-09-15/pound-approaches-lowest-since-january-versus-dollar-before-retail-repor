The pound approached its weakest
level since January against the dollar before a report that
economists said will show U.K. retail sales dropped last month,
adding to the case for more central bank asset-purchases.  Sterling slid earlier to the least since January 2009
against the yen. Retail sales, including fuel, fell 0.3 percent,
after increasing 0.2 percent in July, the  Office for National
Statistics  will say today in  London , according to the median
forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Sterling is clearly on the back foot because of its weak
fundamentals,” Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist
at Rabobank International in London, said in an interview
yesterday. “It’s clear that the  Bank of England  is more
concerned about the weakness of domestic demand and are
maintaining the view that inflation will drop back
significantly.”  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.5755 at 8:25 a.m. in
London, after sliding to $1.5707 yesterday, the lowest since
Jan. 12. The currency was little changed at 120.80 yen, after
reaching 120.682, the weakest level since Jan. 26, 2009. It was
also little changed, at 87.27 pence per euro.  Britain’s currency has depreciated 6 percent in the past 12
months against a basket of nine major peers, the second-worst
performer after the dollar, which fell 6.8 percent, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  U.K.  government bonds  rose, with the 10-year gilt yield
dropping two basis points to 2.43 percent, and the two-year
yield also falling two basis points, to 0.55 percent.  Gilts have returned 2.9 percent this month, compared with
2.1 percent for German government bonds and 1.1 percent for  U.S.
Treasuries , according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
