International Monetary Fund Deputy
Managing Director Zhu Min said emerging economies including
 China  shouldn’t over-rely on real estate for growth, China’s
official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing an interview.  Nations that depend on real estate as a main source of
growth end up in crises, Zhu said, as cited by Xinhua. Emerging
nations should turn to industries including new-energy machinery
and mining machinery, he said in Dalian, China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
