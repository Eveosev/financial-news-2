TNK-BP, the Russian oil venture
owned by  BP Plc (BP/)  and a group of billionaires, won’t cut refining
volumes as the country moves to the so-called 60-66 system of
export duties,  German Khan , an executive director and
shareholder in the producer, told reporters today in Moscow.  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed an order last month
that will raise export taxes on heavy products such as  fuel oil 
and cut them on light products such as diesel starting Oct. 1.  The measure unifies refined-product export taxes at 66
percent of the crude levy, part of the 60-66 measure to spur
investment in Russia’s world-leading oil production. A special
tax on gasoline is set at 90 percent of the crude duty.  Putin may also lower the crude export duty using a 60
percent rate, down from 65 percent previously.  To contact the reporter on this story:
