CEZ AS (CEZ)  is replacing Chief Executive
Officer Martin Roman with Chief Operating Officer Daniel Benes
to focus on the construction of new reactors at its Temelin
power plant, Prime Minister Petr Necas told  Mlada Fronta Dnes .  “This ends one era of CEZ’s development, associated mainly
with acquisitions abroad, and starts another, the main theme of
which will be the expansion of the Temelin nuclear power
station,” Necas said in an interview for the Prague-based
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
