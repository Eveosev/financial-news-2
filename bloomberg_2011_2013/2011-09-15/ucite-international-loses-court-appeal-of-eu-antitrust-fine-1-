Mitsubishi Rayon Co. unit Lucite
International lost a European Union court appeal of a 25
million-euro ($34.5 million) antitrust fine levied for colluding
on prices of acrylic glass.  The company failed to show that the EU’s antitrust agency
“erred in its assessment,” the EU General Court, the region’s
second-highest tribunal, said in a ruling in Luxembourg today.  The European Commission fined four companies 344.5 million
euros in 2006 for rigging prices of acrylic glass used in DVDs
and cars.  Arkema SA (AKE)  in June won a 105.8 million-euro reduction
from its 219.1 million-fine in the cartel after the EU court
ruled the commission had made mistakes in its calculation.  Lucite International, based in Southampton,  England ,
declined to comment on today’s ruling. Amelia Torres, a
spokeswoman for the commission in Brussels, said the regulator
welcomed the decision.  Mitsubishi Rayon completed the $1.6 billion takeover of
U.K. acrylic maker Lucite International Group Holdings Ltd. in
2009.  The case is: T-216/06, Lucite International and Lucite
International UK v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
