Overhauling entitlement programs is
“critically important” to bringing the U.S. deficit under
control, House Speaker  John Boehner  said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television.  The speaker, an Ohio Republican, said he is convinced the
debt-cutting supercommittee “can and will work” to find a way
to cut $1.5 trillion from the federal deficit. He said there are
“some good parts” of President Barack Obama’s job-creation
plan while reiterating Republicans’ stance that tax increases
don’t make “any economic sense.”  Regarding Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who
has been criticized by some Republican presidential candidates,
the speaker said he supported the chairman’s reappointment and
said, “I’m glad he’s there.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
