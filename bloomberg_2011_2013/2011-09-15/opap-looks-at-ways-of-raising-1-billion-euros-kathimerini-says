Opap SA (OPAP) , a Greek gambling company,
is looking at ways of raising 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to
fund an extension of its sports-betting monopoly and the
issuance of 35,000 government video-lottery licenses,
Kathimerini reported.  A 10-year extension of the monopoly will cost 400 million
euros, compared with the 500 million initially requested by the
government, which is granting the extension, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The  interest rate  on a syndicated loan would be about 9
percent and might be more than 15 percent for a bond; Opap is
discussing the possibility of cheaper funding plans with the
government, Kathimerini said.  For Related News and Information:
