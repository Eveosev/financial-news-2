Following is the text of the U.S.
 Seasonal Drought Outlook  as released by the  National Weather
Service  in  Camp Springs , Maryland:  Latest Seasonal Assessment - The drought outlook for September
15, 2011 December 2011 was based primarily upon climate
anomalies associated with La Nina as it is expected to
strengthen and continue throughout this period. Persistence or
development can be expected across much of the Southeast
excluding  North Carolina  and areas soaked by Tropical Storm Lee.
The return of La Nina also elevates the chances for persistence
across the exceptional drought areas of the southern Plains. It
should be noted that forecast confidence across the western Gulf
region and Southeast is tempered due to the potential for heavy
rainfall associated with tropical cyclone activity during the
fall. The waning of the summer monsoon and enhanced odds for
below median precipitation during October - December favor
persistence or development across most of the Southwest. Based
on consecutive La Nina composites, persistence or development is
favored across the middle Mississippi Valley and lower Ohio
Valley. A slightly drier climatology from October through
December tilts the odds towards persistence for the small
drought areas in the northwest Corn Belt and upper Mississippi
Valley. Across  Hawaii , drought persistence is forecast for the
western Big Island, Molokai, and Maui since the wet signal
associated with La Nina typically becomes established later in
the winter.  SOURCE: National Weather Service  To contact the reporter on this story:
