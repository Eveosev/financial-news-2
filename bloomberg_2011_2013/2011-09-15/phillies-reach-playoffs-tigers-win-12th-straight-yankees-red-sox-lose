The  Philadelphia Phillies  became
the first Major League Baseball team to clinch a playoff berth
this season with a 1-0 win over the Houston Astros.  Roy Halladay  pitched a six-hit shutout yesterday at
Houston’s Minute Maid Park to improve to 18-5 and become the
first Philadelphia pitcher to record 18 wins in consecutive
seasons since Steve Carlton in 1979-80.  The Phillies snapped a three-game losing streak and
improved their major league-best record to 95-51. They lead the
National League Eastern Division by 11 games over the Atlanta
Braves, who beat the Florida Marlins 4-1.  The Phillies’ so-called magic number to win the NL East is
four, meaning any combination of their wins and Braves losses
totaling four gives Philadelphia a fifth straight division title.
The Phillies have a double header at home today against the
Marlins before hosting the  St. Louis Cardinals  in a four-game
series.  The Detroit Tigers beat the Chicago White Sox 6-5 in 10
innings yesterday to extend their winning streak to 12 games,
their longest run since 1934.  The Tigers, who lead the Cleveland Indians by 13 1/2 games
in the American League Central, lowered their magic number to
clinch their first division title in 17 years to three.  The  Texas Rangers  defeated the Indians 9-1 to maintain a 3-
game lead atop the AL West over the Los Angeles Angels, who beat
the Oakland Athletics 4-1 as Jered Weaver picked up his career-
high 17th win of the season.  Luis Rodriguez gave the Seattle Mariners a 2-1 win over the
 New York Yankees  with a walk-off home run in the 12th inning,
his second homer of the season.  The Yankees had a three-game winning streak snapped to
remain four games ahead of the  Boston Red Sox  in the AL East.  The Red Sox, who have dropped 10 of 13, lost 5-4 to the
Toronto Blue Jays to lead the  Tampa Bay Rays  by four games in
the race for the AL wild card playoff spot.  Boston (86-62) hosts Tampa Bay (82-66) in a four-game
series starting today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
