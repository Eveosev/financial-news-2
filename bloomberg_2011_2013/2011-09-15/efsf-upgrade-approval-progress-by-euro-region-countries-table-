Following is a table detailing each
euro nation’s progress in approving expanded powers for the
region’s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.  Spain and Luxembourg yesterday became the fourth and fifth
countries to authorize the enhancements to the 440 billion-euro
($604 billion) fund, joining France, Italy and  Belgium .  The enhanced powers of the EFSF take effect when all euro-
region countries have ratified the changes. European Union
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  called on
euro-region governments to quickly pass the EFSF changes at a
meeting of finance ministers in Wroclaw,  Poland  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
