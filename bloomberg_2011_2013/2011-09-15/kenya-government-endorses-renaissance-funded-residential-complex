Kenya ’s Vision 2030 delivery
secretariat, which is implementing the country’s economic
development plan, formally endorsed Tatu City, a planned $5
billion residential complex outside Nairobi.  Tatu City’s investors include Renaissance Partners, the
investment unit of Moscow-based Renaissance Group, and domestic
companies, Mugo Kibati, chief executive officer of the Vision
2030 Delivery Secretariat, told reporters in Nairobi today.
The city will be privately funded and managed.  More than 70 percent of Kenyans are expected to live in
urban areas by 2030, compared with about 30 percent now, Kibati
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
