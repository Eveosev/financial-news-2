Donations to the biggest college
sports programs climbed as the  U.S. economy  faltered, with
contributions rising 24 percent from the middle of 2006 to the
middle of 2010.  The 54 public schools in the six most powerful sports
conferences collected $998 million in fiscal 2010, up from $805
million in 2007, according to records from colleges in the
Atlantic Coast, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and
Southeastern conferences. The increase came during a period when
unemployment jumped to 9.5 percent from 4.6 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 19.5 percent, to 1,030.71.  What sustained contribution levels were the gifts that
schools require fans make to purchase, or hold on to, tickets
for prime seats, according to fundraising executives. While one
season ticket for  University of Florida  football games costs
$259, a Gator fan who wants to sit in a premium seat near the
50-yard line would have to donate an additional $2,450.  “People are worried about paying their mortgage and car
payment and covering the gas bill, and they are making cuts in
other areas of their lives to hold onto their Gator tickets,”
said Doug Brown, associate executive director of Gator Boosters
Inc. “It’s surprising we’re doing as well as we are.”  Audited results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011,
won’t be available until January. Fundraising executives said
giving was basically flat for that period, which they view as a
victory.  “For now, holding serve is a win,” Brown said.  Most Gifts  Stumpy Harris, 73, who founded the law firm  Harris
Harris Bauerle Sharma  in  Orlando , bought his first Gators
football season tickets in 1956. He now owns 14 of them around
the 45-yard-line, plus a 30-person suite. He gives an
undisclosed sum to keep his seat placement, and said he would
economize in other areas before he would give that up.  “The fall is the high social season,” said Harris, whose
son Bruce proposed to his wife, Medea, at the stadium. 
“We’ll break bread with people we haven’t seen since last year.”  He said he keeps his original seats for sentimental reasons
and because “there are certain games where you want to smell
it,” which requires leaving the suite.  “I like to get down there and rub shoulders with
everybody,” he said.  Florida is among the schools that received the most in
gifts last year -- $39.4 million, up from $36.9 million in 2007.
Contributions didn’t rise in fiscal 2011, Brown said. He said he
can’t provide a total until the donations have been audited.  Hitting Wallets  Once boosters feel confident about the economy again,
giving “will bounce back,” Brown said. “That confident
feeling is different for each individual.”  The other schools in the top five that recorded the most in
donations last year were the  University of Oregon  in Eugene at
$73.8 million, up from $10.6 million in 2007;  Oklahoma State
University  in Stillwater, at $51.9 million, a gain from $18.9
million;  Louisiana State University  in  Baton Rouge  at $38.3
million, up from $19.6 million; and the  University of Texas  in
Austin at $37.1 million, compared with $27.2 million in 2007.  Oregon ’s 2010 number was outsized because of a one-time
gift of $41.7 million from Nike Inc. Chairman  Phil Knight .
Knight was a track athlete when he attended the university,
graduating in 1959 with a bachelor’s degree in accounting.  Rob Mullens, the school’s athletic director, said the
economy has “hit the wallets of everybody.” He said that while
he can’t provide a total until the books are audited, donations
were probably between $15 million and $20 million, basically
flat from the previous year.  Energy Insulation  Mullens said demand still is high for tickets for key spots
-- and the gifts required to reserve them -- in the 54,000-seat
Autzen Stadium. The school said it has sold out 74 consecutive
home football games for the Ducks, who lost the national
championship last season on a last-second field goal to Auburn.  At Oklahoma State, many athletic department donors have
profited from a run-up in the energy sector, said Larry Reece,
senior director of major gifts. The  S&P 500  Oil & Gas
Exploration & Production Index has climbed 24 percent since the
end of 2009, compared with a 16 percent gain in the broader
index. Energy suppliers in the S&P 500 have earned $481.1
billion since 2006, more than last year’s gross domestic product
of  Argentina , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are fortunate that we are a little insulated from the
downturn,” Reece said. “We have a lot of donors who work in
the energy sector, which is what drives the economy and seems to
be getting through this better than most.”  Partisan Politics  Oklahoma State has received more than $600 million since
2003, including about $300 million from energy tycoon  T. Boone Pickens , chairman of BP Capital LLC. In the previous 50 years,
donations totaled $9 million.  The Cowboys kicked off a $115 million campaign to endow
athletic scholarships in 2007 and the fund has grown to more
than $50 million from $2.1 million, Reece said.  At Louisiana State, “people that give to athletics are
extending their pledges from three years to five years because
of the uncertainly with the economy,” said R.G. Richard, a
retired Marine major general who manages the Tiger Athletic
Foundation. “But we’ve seen no decrease in the sale of football
tickets or donations for the tickets.”  Richard said partisan politics in Washington is hurting,
not helping, the economy -- and that can hurt fundraising.  “I’m an independent,” he said, “and I’m ticked off at
both parties, and the president too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
