(Corrects spelling of chairman’s name in first, second
paragraphs.)  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011) 
has halted discussions on buying a stake in Areva SA, the
largest provider of nuclear equipment and services, because the
French company says it doesn’t need extra capital, La Tribune
reported, citing Mitsubishi Heavy Chairman Kazuo Tsukuda.  The companies have a joint venture that is bidding to build
reactors in Jordan and Turkey, the newspaper quoted Tsukuda as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
