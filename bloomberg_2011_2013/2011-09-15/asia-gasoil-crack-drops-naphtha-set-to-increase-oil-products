Asia ’s gasoil crack spread fell to
the narrowest in almost seven months, signaling decreased profit
for refiners making the distillate fuel. Naphtha derivative
contracts were set to extend gains.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian benchmark Dubai
crude declined 15 cents to $16.67 a barrel at 12 p.m. Singapore
time, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based
broker. This crack spread, a measure of refining profit, is at
the narrowest since Feb. 25.  Gasoil swaps for October increased 15 cents to $122 a
barrel, ending a four-day losing streak, PVM said. Jet fuel’s
premium to gasoil dropped 30 cents to $1.85. This regrade fell
the most in three weeks, indicating it is less profitable to
make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
second-half October delivery were bid at $963 a metric ton
against offers of $966, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore
Pte, a broker. This signals prices may advance for a third day,
after the contract closed at $957.63 yesterday.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
added $2.26 to $113.07 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread is the widest this week.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday fell $1.15 to
$17.45 a barrel, based on Bloomberg calculations. A narrowing
reforming margin shows motor fuel is less profitable to produce.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 28 cents to
$5.95 a barrel, according to PVM. A smaller gap indicates
reduced losses for refiners turning crude oil into residual
products.  October high-sulfur  fuel oil  swaps rose $4.25, or 0.7
percent, to $646 a ton, PVM said. The premium of 180-centistoke
fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade was down 25 cents at $9, the
lowest this month. A narrowing viscosity spread means bunker, or
marine fuel, dropped less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
