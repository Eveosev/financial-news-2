Bharat Petroleum Corp.,  India ’s
second-biggest state-run refiner, plans to raise the equivalent
of about $400 million in a foreign currency-denominated loan,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  The Mumbai-based refiner has approached banks, and may
appoint them in two weeks, said the person, asking not to be
identified because the details are private. The proceeds will be
used to help fund 40 billion rupees ($836 million) of capital
expenditure this year, the person said.  Bharat Petroleum’s Chairman R.K. Singh didn’t answer two
calls to his mobile phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
