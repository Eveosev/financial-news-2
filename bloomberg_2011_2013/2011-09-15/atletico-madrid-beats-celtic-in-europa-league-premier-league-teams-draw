Atletico Madrid  beat Celtic 2-0 on
the opening night of group-stage play in soccer’s Europa League,
as all three English Premier League teams tied.  Radamel Falcao and Diego scored the goals for Atletico,
which won Europe’s second-tier club competition in 2010, in a
Group I game last night in Spain. Falcao joined Atletico after
scoring a competition record 17 goals last season to help Porto
to the Europa League title.  Ognjen Vukojevic’s goal in stoppage time gave Dynamo Kiev a
1-1 home draw Stoke in Group E. Fulham also tied 1-1 with FC
Twente in Group K, while Tottenham and PAOK Salonika finished
scoreless in Group A. Lino missed a penalty kick for PAOK after
being made to retake it because a teammate was in the penalty
area. He scored with his first attempt.  Rubin Kazan  beat Shamrock Rovers, the first Irish club to
reach the group stage of a major European club competition, 3-0
in the other Group A match.  The fourth English team in the tournament, second-division
Birmingham was a 3-1 home loser to Braga, last season’s runner-
up to Porto, in Group H.  Hugo Almeida scored twice as Besiktas beat Maccabi Tel-Aviv
5-1 in Group E, while Matias Suarez’s had a hat trick as
Anderlecht defeated AEK Athens 4-1 in Group L. AZ Alkmaar, PSV
Eindhoven, Paris Saint-Germain, Udinese and Copenhagen also
opened with victories, as Lazio drew 2-2 at home with Vaslui.  The top two teams in each of the 12 groups advance to the
round of 32 alongside the eight third-place finishers from the
elite  Champions League  group stage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
