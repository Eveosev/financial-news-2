McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  plans to open 25
restaurants annually for the next four years in  South Africa  and
double its revenue in the nation, Business Day reported, citing
Greg Solomon, managing director of the local unit.  McDonald’s South Africa will focus on expanding in the
country, which prevents it from considering opening operations
elsewhere on the continent for the next two years, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Solomon as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
