Argentina  raised the nation’s corn
export quota by 300,000 tons for crops from the 2010-2011
season, less than the increase expected by the nation’s corn
association.  The higher quota applies to crops that have already been
harvested, Agriculture Undersecretary Oscar Solis said yesterday
in a phone interview from Buenos Aires. The government also set
an export quota of 7.5 million tons for crops from the 2011-2012
season, which are currently being planted, Solis said.  The additional 2010-2011 quota is below the estimate of a
1.5 million-ton quota increase predicted by Maizar, Argentina’s
corn association. The amount of corn authorized for export is
lower because the previous quota of about 12 million tons has
not been met and more exports can still be allowed if needed,
Solis said.  Argentina is the world’s second biggest exporter of corn,
behind the U.S.  The nation’s government requires that corn producers
earmark 8 million tons per year for domestic consumption. Output
in Argentina was about 21 million tons in the 2010-2011 season.
Export quotas are announced over the course of the year.  Maizar represents members of the entire corn industry, from
farmers to exporters as well as seed companies, mills and
traders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
