European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said countries offering advice on how
 Europe  should solve its debt crisis should put their own fiscal
situation in order first.  “Finger-pointing in the direction of Europe shouldn’t
prevent others from putting their budgets in order and doing
their homework before handing out advice to Europeans,” Stark
said at an event in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
