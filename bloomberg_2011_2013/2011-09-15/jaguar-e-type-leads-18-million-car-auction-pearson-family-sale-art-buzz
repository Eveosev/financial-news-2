A rare Jaguar E-type is the top lot
in an $18 million sale that will today test demand for classic
cars as prices rise to records.  The 1963 “Semi-Lightweight” hardtop Jaguar E-Type leads
89 vehicles offered by  Bonhams  at the annual  Goodwood Revival 
festival in Sussex,  England . The gray E-Type, one of two road
models built as variants of the 12 competition cars the factory
created to take on Ferrari at  Le Mans , may fetch as much as 2
million pounds ($3.16 million).  The sale comes after Gooding & Co., RM Auctions and Bonhams
raised $166.7 million from their Monterey events in August. The
total was up from $150.2 million in 2010. A 1957 Ferrari Testa
Rossa was sold by Gooding for $16.4 million, a record for any
car at auction.  “Those results confirmed the market is healthy,” said
Dietrich Hatlapa, the founder of price database Historic
Automobile Group International and the author of “Better than
Gold: Investing in Historic Cars.” “An increasing number of
people are looking to buy tangible assets,” he said.  The Jaguar offered today has a claimed top speed of 165 mph
and was made for the shipping magnate Robert Ropner. It has its
original paintwork and hasn’t been offered at auction before.  Other highlights of the sale include a Lister-Jaguar racer
that dominated the Sports Car Club of America championships of
1958 and 1959, and a 1964  Aston Martin  DB5 being sold by singer
Shane Filan, of the Irish pop band  Westlife . These carry upper
estimates of 1 million pounds and 300,000 pounds respectively.
The auction total is valued at as much as 11 million pounds.  Pearson Family  Paintings and antiques belonging to members of the family
that founded media group  Pearson Plc (PSON)  raised 7.9 million pounds
in a three-day auction at Cowdray Park, West Sussex.  The 1,212-lot Christie’s International sale, which ended
last night, combined the contents of Lord Cowdray’s ancestral
home with items from  Dunecht , the house of his brother Charles Pearson. The presale estimate was about 5 million pounds.  Portraits were the most valuable lots. A painting of a lady
thought to be Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham, was the
most expensive at 325,250 pounds. Made by an English artist in
about 1600, it was priced at 250,000 pounds to 350,000 pounds.  Among the quirkier ``country house'' lots was a set of 11 
late-19th-century fire helmets and an ax from Dunecht in 
 Scotland . These sold for 4,750 pounds against an estimate of 
1,500 pounds to 2,500 pounds. Buyers hailed from 34 different 
countries and 93 percent of the lots were sold.  Cowdray Park , which is itself up for sale for 25 million
pounds, was bought by Weetman Dickinson Pearson, the first Lord
Cowdray, a Yorkshire-born engineer and oil magnate, in 1908.  Auctions Watched  Auctions of contemporary art and wine in London this week
were being watched for signs of whether the turmoil in financial
markets has affected demand for alternative investments.  Contemporary art and wine were two of the auction market's 
biggest growth areas in 2010.  The risk of an economic crisis could stall growth in the
market for contemporary art, London-based analyst  ArtTactic  said
in July. Similar concerns have been raised by brokers about the
sustainability of record auction prices being paid by Asian
bidders for trophy-label Bordeaux such as Lafite and Latour.  “We were all wondering how the sale would do,” said
Darren Leak, the specialist in charge of Christie’s mid-season
Sept. 14 offering of contemporary artworks priced at less than
200,000 pounds. “The results turned out to be fine, though a
lot of reserves were lowered and there was less demand for some
of the younger artists.”  Sale Total  Christie’s sale raised 2.9 million pounds, with 67 percent
of the 264 lots selling. Last year’s equivalent event totaled 2
million pounds with 68 percent successful.  The top price was 181,250 pounds, paid for the 1997 work
“Jogo de Velha Serie C 8A (Tic-Tac-Toe Serie C 8A),” made of
wooden rulers by the Brazilian artist  Cildo Meireles . The price,
paid by a Brazilian buyer, was three times the low estimate.  Banksy's 2002 landscape titled ``Bird and Grenade'' was 
snapped up by an Asian commission bidder for 145,250 pounds 
against an upper estimate of 50,000 pounds.  Elsewhere, bargains were to be had. The 6-foot (1.8 meter) 
canvas ``Young Purpurea,'' by the London-based Japanese artist 
Masakatsu Kondo, was knocked down for 250 pounds after being 
valued at 2,500 pounds to 3,500 pounds.  Demand for contemporary art will be examined again by
offerings at Christie’s,  Sotheby’s (BID)  and Phillips de Pury & Co. in
 New York  next week.  Also on Sept. 14, Sotheby’s saw reduced levels of Asian
bidding at a 459-lot wine sale.  Asian Buyers  Asian buyers secured eight of the 10 most expensive lots at
the company’s two-day “40th Anniversary” auction last
September. A year later, only one of the top 10 lots -- a case
of six magnums of 1996 Lafite -- was bought by an Asian bidder.
It sold within estimate for 13,800 pounds.  “There wasn’t so much bidding from that region,” Stephen Mould, Sotheby’s European head of wine, said in an interview.
``They've paid some exceptional prices over the last year or so 
and maybe they're casting their nets wider. Lafite prices have 
leveled off a bit.''  The sale totaled 886,454 pounds with fees against a low 
estimate of 961,000 pounds, based on hammer prices. Last year, 
selling rates of more than 90 percent were the norm at 
international wine sales. Here, 84.5 percent of the lots were 
successful.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
