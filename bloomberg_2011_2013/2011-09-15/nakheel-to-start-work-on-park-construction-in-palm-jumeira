Nakheel PJSC, the developer of man-
made islands off Dubai’s coast, will start next month the
building of a public park in its Palm Jumeirah project.  The park will be located on 1 million square-feet (92,900
square-meters) of land between the Shoreline apartments and the
Golden Mile development and will include a 3-kilometer jogging
track and children’s playgrounds, the Dubai-based company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
