Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB)  shares rose the
most in more than a year after the clothing retailer reported
August sales that were better than analysts anticipated.  Revenue at stores and online sites open for at least a year
was unchanged last month, the Stockholm-based company said in a
statement today. Analysts surveyed by SME Direkt had anticipated
a drop of 7.2 percent on that basis.  “The result is pleasing as it suggests the underlying rate
of sales has improved, which may indicate H&M’s competitive
pricing is gaining more traction with customers,” said analysts
including Richard Chamberlain at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The world’s second-largest clothing maker has struggled to
keep up with larger rival Inditex SA, owner of the Zara chain,
as the higher cost of making garments hurt profit. H&M is
opening stores in new regions to help bolster sales and in
November will sell a collection designed by Donatella Versace.  H&M shares rose as much as 13.10 kronor, or 7.1 percent, to
197.90 kronor and traded at 195.90 kronor as of 9:31 a.m. The
intraday gain was the biggest since Jan. 28, 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
