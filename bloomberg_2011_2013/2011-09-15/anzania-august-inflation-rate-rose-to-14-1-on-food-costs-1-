Tanzanian inflation accelerated to
14.1 percent in August on a surge in the cost of food, the
statistics office said.  The rate rose to a 15-month high in August from 13 percent
in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement
handed to reporters today in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial
capital. Prices increased 1.4 percent in the month, it said.  The annual inflation rate for food climbed to 17.4 percent
in August from 14.8 percent, offset by a slowdown in energy
inflation to 30.1 percent from 34.2 percent after regulators
reduced fuel pump prices at the start of August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
