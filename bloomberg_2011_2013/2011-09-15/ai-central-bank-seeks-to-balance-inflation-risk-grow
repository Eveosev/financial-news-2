Thailand ’s central bank is trying
to find the “right balance” between inflation risk and threats
to economic growth, Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said.  The risks to growth have increased as the economic problems
in  Europe  and the U.S. worsened, while inflation risks remain,
Prasarn told reporters today.  “So it is the Monetary Policy Committee’s job to find the
right balance,” Prasarn said. “It’s not necessary for real
interest rates, which are now in the negative area, to turn to
zero or become positive,” he added. “But leaving the
real rate in the deep negative area when the economic growth
returns to normal may lead to imbalances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
