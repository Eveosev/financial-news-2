Peru’s government is seeking a 5
percent budget increase next year, Finance Minister Miguel
Castilla said.  The government aims to boost spending to help offset slower
growth, Castilla said in testimony before Congress supporting
the budget proposal. The budget will be 95 billion soles ($35
billion), he said. The 5 percent increase is smaller than this
year’s 7 percent rise over 2010 because of the risk that  tax
revenue  will shrink due to slower global growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
