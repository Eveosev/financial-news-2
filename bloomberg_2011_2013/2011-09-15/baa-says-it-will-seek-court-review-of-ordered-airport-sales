BAA Ltd., the owner of  London ’s
 Heathrow Airport , said it will seek a judicial review of a U.K.
regulator’s order that it sell the U.K. capital’s Stansted
terminal and a base in either Edinburgh or Glasgow.  BAA will ask an appeals tribunal tomorrow to review the
March 2009 decision by the U.K.  Competition Commission , the
company said today in a statement. The regulator said in July
that the breakup is “fully justified,” while BAA has said the
decision was based on outdated information.  BAA, based in London, was first ordered to find buyers for
Gatwick and Stansted in March 2009, together with either
Edinburgh or Glasgow in  Scotland . While Gatwick was sold to
Global Infrastructure Partners Ltd. for 1.51 billion pounds
($2.39 billion), BAA was able to delay the other disposals when
the Competition Appeal Tribunal upheld claims that an adviser to
the regulator had a conflict of interest.  The  Competition Commission , which began investigating
Britain’s airports in March 2007, has said that any changes
since the decision was issued two years ago have been considered
and that customers would still be best served by greater
competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
