Alexander Dobrindt, the general-
secretary of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, called on the
European Commission to stop its proposals for jointly issued
euro area bonds, saying they violate European Union and German
law, Focus reported.   “The Commission must stop its plans for euro bonds right
away,” Dobrindt told the magazine. The CSU is the Bavarian
sister party of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic
Union .   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
