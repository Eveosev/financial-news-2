The strengthening dollar may signal
a decline in U.S. equities similar to the relationship between
the two assets in 2008 during the biggest financial crisis since
the 1930s, technical analysis by Auerbach Grayson Co. showed.  The U.S. currency’s rally may coincide with a decline in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of as much as 15 percent if the
historical inverse relationship between stocks and the dollar
holds,  Richard Ross , a technical analyst with the New York-based
brokerage, said in a telephone interview yesterday. When the
dollar rallied 24 percent from July 2008 to March 2009, the S&P
500 went on to lose 44 percent during the eight-month period,
falling to a 12-year low.  “The technical specter of a stronger dollar is the latest
evidence of a bearish environment for equities similar to what
we saw in 2008,” Ross said. “We have a remarkable example of
technical symmetry with the meaningful break-out to the upside
in the dollar similar to the summer of 2008 when that rally
pushed the equity markets off the cliff,” he said. “It is not
a contrarian buy-signal, but a true wall of worry.”  The euro had its biggest loss against the dollar in more
than a year last week amid concern about the region’s deepening
debt crisis. The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency
against those of six trading partners, climbed above its 200-day
moving on Sept. 8 for the first time in a year as the dollar
increased 5.2 percent from the end of August to a seven-month
high on Sept. 12.  S&P 500   The S&P 500 fell 2.5 percent during the first two weeks of
September as  Greece ’s finances deteriorated. Between April 29
and Aug. 8, the S&P 500 fell 18 percent amid concern about the
European debt crisis and after S&P downgraded the U.S.
government’s credit rating. It closed as low as 1,119.46 on Aug.
8, within 29 points of a  bear market , or a 20 percent drop. The
benchmark gauge for American equities ended yesterday at
1,188.68, 6.2 percent above the Aug. 8 closing level.  “Global companies dependent on overseas revenues are going
to be impacted by a two-headed monster of eroding fundamentals
in  Europe  and the U.S., and eroding technicals now in terms of
the dollar,” Ross said. “This ‘perfect storm’ continues and I
would be hesitant to think we reached a bottom.”  The analyst said the S&P 500 may test the 1,006 level,
which represents a 61 percent retracement of the bull-market
advance that began in March 2009.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  “Even if you don’t think we’re going to revisit the credit
crisis lows of the stock market, this still suggests there’s a
lot of room to the downside,” Ross said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
