A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk fell for a third day from a two-year high, after
German and French leaders signaled support for  Greece , easing
concerns that  Europe â€™s debt crisis is intensifying.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, fell by 1.5 basis points to a
mid-price of 127.4 basis points as of 8:12 a.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The credit swaps index, which typically falls as
investor confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, has
decreased from 135.9 basis points on Sept. 12, its highest level
since July 2009. The measure has jumped from 96.3 at the end of
July on signs the economic recovery is faltering. U.S. inflation
probably eased and industrial output stalled, economists said
before reports from the Labor Department and  Federal Reserve .  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
