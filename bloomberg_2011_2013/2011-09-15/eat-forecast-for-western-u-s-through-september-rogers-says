Heat is expected to take hold in
the western U.S. through the end of the month while temperatures
in the East will be more seasonal starting next week, according
to  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Rogers’s 6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day forecasts call for
warmer weather from the Rocky Mountains to the West Coast until
Sept. 29.  Parched Texas may receive about 1 inch of rain starting
this weekend, he said. About 96 percent of Texas’s pasture and
rangelands are rated poor, according to the National Drought
Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Nebraska. Areas classified as
having the worst levels of drought also include parts of
Oklahoma,  New Mexico , Arizona, western Louisiana and southern
Kansas.  Natural gas traders use long-range temperature predictions
to gauge energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather
can increase demand for heating and cooling, and  power plants 
use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
