European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said it is “very
important” that  France  and  Germany  signaled their readiness
to continue supporting Greece.  “It’s very important that yesterday the leaders of the two
largest economies of the euro zone reaffirmed their commitment
to do whatever it takes in order to ensure financial stability
in the euro zone,” Rehn told reporters today in Brussels. “And
they very clearly stated that the future of Greece is in the
euro zone,” he said.  “One should not underestimate the political will and also
ability of euro-zone leaders to take the necessary decisions to
safeguard financial stability in the euro zone and thus on their
part work so that the problems in  Greece  will be overcome,”
Rehn said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
