Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank
for Industry & Trade, or VietinBank, may offer a coupon of 5
percent to 6 percent on its planned $500 million overseas bond
sale this year, Chairman Pham Huy Hung said in an interview in
Hanoi today.  The lender is “determined to sell the bonds within this
year,” said Hung.  The coupon will be determined based on market conditions,
Deputy General Director Le Duc Tho said at a company conference.  The bond sale will take place in the fourth quarter, Tho
said. The company has sought approval from the country’s central
bank for the issue, he said last month.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Bank Plc have been appointed
advisers and will jointly arrange the sale, Tho told Bloomberg
News Sept. 12.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
