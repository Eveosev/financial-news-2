Russian industrial production
expanded more than estimated last month.  Output at factories, mines and utilities rose 6.2 percent
in August from a year earlier after growing 5.2 percent in July,
the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said in an e-mailed
statement today. The median estimate of 16 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was 5.5 percent.  Russia’s manufacturing growth in August was “sluggish,”
remaining below 50 for a second month on the HSBC Purchasing
Managers’ Index, which indicates a contraction. The index rose
last month to a seasonally adjusted 49.9 from 49.8 in July, HSBC
Holdings Plc said in a report today, citing data compiled by
London-based Markit Economics.  Manufacturing expanded 7.1 percent in August from a year
earlier as car and bus production climbed, after growing 5.5
percent the previous month, the service said. Output at mines
was 3.3 percent higher in August, while production at utilities
advanced 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
