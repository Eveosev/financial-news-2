Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) 
expects to close the purchase of a 70 percent stake in  EFG
Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) ’s Polbank unit this year, earlier than
anticipated originally, according to  slides prepared for a
roadshow  and released on its website today.  Raiffeisen, eastern Europe’s third-biggest lender, had
previously expected the acquisition to close by the first
quarter of next year. The expected closing was brought forward
because “signals” from the Polish authorities who need to
approve the deal were “positive,” spokesman Michael Palzer
said on the telephone from Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
