A ship carrying radioactive waste
arrived in  Japan , the first shipment of the dangerous material
since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that triggered the
Fukushima nuclear crisis.  The 5,100-ton Pacific Grebe arrived at  Mutsu-Ogawara port 
in northern Japan today, Masako Sawai, a member of Tokyo-based
 Citizen’s Nuclear Information Center , said by phone. She was
among about 50 protesters at the port.  Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd.  is receiving the cargo of spent
fuel from Japanese nuclear plants that was reprocessed in the
U.K. Kyoji Ebisawa, a spokesman at the company, said he can’t
comment on the arrival until the waste is delivered to the
nearby Rokkasho storage site later today.  Thousands of workers are struggling to contain radiation
leaks after the meltdown of three reactors at Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, about 400 kilometers (240
miles) south of the port.  “The accident at Fukushima hasn’t been resolved,” Sawai
said. “We are concerned accidents can happen during the
transportation of radioactive waste.  The Pacific Grebe set sail from the port of Barrow-in-
Furness in the U.K. on Aug. 3. The waste is sealed in 76
stainless steel canisters.  Japan contracted the U.K. and  France  to process its fuel in
the 1970s and waste from the process is shipped back for
storage. Today’s cargo is the second shipment from the U.K. and
about eight more shipments are scheduled through 2020, according
to Ebisawa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
