Denmark’s the Social Democrat-led
opposition bloc defeated the Liberal-Conservative government and
its allies, according to a count of 99.1 percent of the votes by
broadcaster Danmarks Radio.  The opposition, led by Social Democrat Helle Thorning- Schmidt, unseated a coalition headed by Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen and supported by the Danish  People’s Party  and
the Liberal Alliance.  The following is a list of the number of seats in
parliament each party would win if the count is confirmed by the
final result. There are 179 seats in the parliament. Four of
those are reserved for lawmakers in  Greenland  and the  Faroe
Islands .  To contact the reporters on this story:
