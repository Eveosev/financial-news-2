Heating oil and gasoline rose,
following Brent oil higher, as the  European Central Bank  said it
will lend dollars to euro-area banks to help lessen the region’s
debt crisis, reducing fears about the region’s economy.  Prices gained as Brent advanced 2.4 percent and gasoil on
ICE Futures Europe surged 3.3 percent. U.S. East Coast plants,
where Nymex futures are delivered, process oil priced versus
Brent. International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and
European Commission representatives will visit Greece this week
and later make a recommendation on the release of further loans
to the nation.  “There’s still an afterglow from idea that Europeans will
step up to help the European debt crisis and that seems be
boosting the euro and Brent,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut.  Heating oil for October delivery rose 7.85 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $3.0235 a gallon at 9:44 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices gained as much as 3.4 percent, the
most since Aug. 10.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said they are “convinced” Greece will stay in
the currency union.  Brent oil for October delivery rose $2.72 to $115.12 a
barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. October-delivery
gasoline increased $30.25 to $952.25 per metric ton.  The dollar fell 0.9 percent against the euro at 9:48 a.m.
in New York, boosting the investment appeal of commodities.  Industrial Production  Heating oil touched $3.0444 at 9:15 a.m. after a report
from the  Federal Reserve  showed U.S. industrial production rose
in August by 0.2 percent, indicating greater demand for  diesel
fuel .  “The feeling is that greater industrial production
translates into greater demand for petroleum products,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for October delivery increased 6 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $2.7858 a gallon on the exchange, after settling
yesterday at the lowest level since Aug. 9. Prices touched
$2.8071.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, declined
1.1 cents to $3.623 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
