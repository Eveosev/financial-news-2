U.S. Representative Spencer Bachus
said the Securities and Exchange Commission may need more money
to make changes he has proposed to address structural flaws and
“organizational incoherence” at the agency.  “An increase in funding is probably necessary as part of
the reform process,” Bachus, an Alabama Republican who leads
the House Financial Services Committee, said today at a hearing
in  Washington . The call for additional funding may put Bachus at
odds with fellow Republicans, who have opposed requests from
President  Barack Obama  and SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro .  Bachus drafted a bill last month that would restructure the
SEC based on reports from the agency’s inspector general, the
Government Accountability Office and the Boston Consulting Group
Inc. He said their findings have revealed that the agency is
“structurally flawed and suffers from operational
inefficiencies and organizational incoherence.”  Republican lawmakers, including Bachus, have faulted the
agency for failing to protect investors before the 2008 credit
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
