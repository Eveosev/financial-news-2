Genting Malaysia Bhd. (GENM) , a Southeast
Asian casino-operator, plans to invest $3 billion to develop a
bayfront resort on land currently housing the Miami Herald Media
Co.’s headquarters.  The project, known as Resorts World Miami, will include
four hotels, two residential towers and a 3.6 acre rooftop
lagoon, on land it agreed to buy from Miami Herald publisher
 McClatchy Co. (MNI)  in May, the Kuala Lumpur-based company said in an
exchange filing today. A casino will be included if Florida’s
legislature and governor approve, Genting Malaysia said.  “Resorts World Miami will accelerate Florida’s evolution
as a global destination,” Genting Malaysia Chairman Lim Kok Thay said in the statement.  Genting Malaysia, which has operated  Malaysia ’s only gaming
resort on a hilltop since 1968, is already the largest casino-
operator in the U.K. and has been seeking opportunities to break
into the U.S. market. Its Resorts World Casino New York City
development is nearing completion on the Aqueduct Racetrack.  The new Miami resort will cover 30 acres of land
overlooking Biscayne Bay, comprising both the Miami Herald site
and adjacent Omni Center, for which Genting Malaysia today said
it had acquired all outstanding mortgages. The project will also
include a convention center, nightclubs and the largest ballroom
in the U.S., it said.  Genting Malaysia is 47-percent owned by Kuala Lumpur-based
Genting Bhd., which is also the parent company of  Genting
Singapore Plc (GENS) , which runs the Resorts World Singapore gaming
resort.  To contact the reporter on this story:
