Libya , holder of Africa’s largest
oil reserves, will resume partial crude exports within three or
four days, the nation’s representative to a meeting of Arab
central bank governors in Doha said.  The North African nation will produce about 700,000 barrels
a day by the end of this year and an estimated 1.6 million
barrels a day by the end of 2012, Abdulla Saudi told reporters
today in the Qatari capital.  Libyan oil exports plummeted amid fighting between rebel
forces and troops loyal to leader Muammar Qaddafi. The country
was pumping about 1.6 million barrels a day before popular
protests in mid-February flared into military conflict, shipping
most of its crude across the Mediterranean to  Europe . It
produced 45,000 barrels in August, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Libya is Africa’s third-largest oil producer after Nigeria
and Angola. Its 44.3 billion barrels account for 3.3 percent of
the world’s total crude deposits, according to BP Plc’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
