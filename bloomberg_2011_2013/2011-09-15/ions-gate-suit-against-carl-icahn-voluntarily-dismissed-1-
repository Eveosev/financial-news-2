Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) ’s
lawsuit against billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  in Manhattan
federal court was voluntarily dismissed by both sides.  Lions Gate, an independent producer of films including
“Precious” and “American Psycho” and the “Mad Men”
television series, sued Icahn in October, claiming he tried to
interfere with the studio’s plan to merge with Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer Inc.  In papers filed with the court today, both sides said the
case is being dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can’t be
reinstituted. The papers didn’t say whether the dismissal is
part of any settlement in the case.  In March, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer dismissed most of
Lions Gate’s allegations, permitting it to go forward with a
claim that Icahn paid a special price for Dallas Mavericks owner
 Mark Cuban ’s 5.4 percent stake in Lions Gate, which the studio
said wasn’t fair to other investors.  William Savitt, a lawyer for Lions Gate and Joseph DiBenedetto, who represents Icahn, didn’t immediately return
messages seeking comment on the court filing.  The case is Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. V. Icahn, 1:10-
cv-08169, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
