Google Inc., the largest Internet
search company, won’t have to face part of  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s claim
that it infringed copyrights for the Java programming language.  U.S. District Judge William Alsup in  San Francisco  today
ruled that some of the material Oracle claimed was infringed
isn’t protected by copyright.  The copyright claim is part of Oracle’s lawsuit against the
search-engine company alleging that the Android operating system
for mobile devices infringes patents that Oracle owns after
acquiring Sun Microsystems Inc.  Oracle accused Google of infringing 12 lines of code and 37
“specifications” for programming interfaces. Alsup said in his
ruling that the names of the specifications that Google copied
aren’t protected by copyright and ruled that the Mountain View,
California-based company must face infringement claims on the
other material.  Oracle, based in Redwood City,  California , seeks billions
of dollars in damages and a court order for the destruction of
all products that violate its copyrights.  The case is Oracle America Inc. v.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , 10-03561,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco).  To contact the reporter about this story:
