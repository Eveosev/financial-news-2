Copper rebounded after German and
French leaders expressed support for  Greece  remaining in the
euro area and labor disputes at copper mines in Indonesia and
Peru spurred concern supplies may tighten. Zinc and lead gained.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange climbed as
much as 1.1 percent to $8,727 per metric ton and traded at
$8,641.50 by 4:16 p.m. in Tokyo. The metal touched $8,590
yesterday, the lowest price since Aug. 11.  Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, the leaders of Europe’s
two biggest economies, issued a statement yesterday after they
spoke with Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  by phone.
Papandreou committed to meet deficit-reduction targets demanded
as a condition for an international bailout, it said.  “All markets were under the influence of Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis, and today we saw some optimism from the
overnight news,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea
Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul. Labor action in  Indonesia 
and Peru also supported the market, he said.  China is willing to buy the bonds of nations hit by the
debt crisis, Caijing reported on its website yesterday, citing
 Zhang Xiaoqiang , a vice chairman of the National Development and
Reform Commission.  Asian stocks advanced today, lifting the region’s benchmark
index from a one-year low. Still, U.S. data today may show
industrial production stalled in August, according to a survey
of economists by Bloomberg News.  Mine Strikes  Workers at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Peruvian
unit failed to reach a wage agreement and will continue a strike
that began yesterday, a union official said. Workers and
officials at Freeport’s  Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde SAA (CVERDEC1)  unit,
 Peru ’s third-largest producer, are scheduled to resume talks
today, Mining Federation General Secretary Luis Castillo said.  In Indonesia, about 8,000 non-staff workers at Freeport’s
Grasberg mine started a one-month strike, Virgo Solossa, head of
organizational affairs at a labor union, said yesterday.  Copper for November delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange closed little changed at 65,080 yuan ($10,189) per ton.  Zinc rose 0.5 percent to $2,171.75 per ton in London and
lead advanced 0.2 percent to $2,347.75 per ton. Aluminum gained
0.2 percent to $2,363.25 per ton and nickel dropped 0.2 percent
to $21,325 a ton. Tin was also little changed at $23,430 per ton
after rising as much as 1.3 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
