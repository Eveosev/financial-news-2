Drug-resistant tuberculosis is
spreading at an “alarming rate” in Europe, the  World Health
Organization  said as it introduced a plan to fight the disease
that may save 120,000 lives and as much as $12 billion.  Reported cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis
in the region tripled in 2009 from 2008 levels, and the six
countries with the world’s highest rates of patients with the
most dangerous drug-evading form are all in Europe, the WHO said
in a  statement  yesterday.  The London borough of Brent, home to Wembley Stadium and
the headquarters of brewer Diageo Plc, has become western
Europe’s tuberculosis capital, with more new cases each year
than Karonga district in Malawi, a rural area still battling
leprosy, according to the U.K.’s Health Protection Agency.  “This problem is a man-made phenomenon resulting from
inadequate treatment or poor airborne infection control,” Hans
Kluge, a special representative on drug-resistant tuberculosis
in the WHO’s European region, said in the statement. “We need
wide involvement to tackle the damage that humankind has done.”  European nations aim to diagnose at least 85 percent of
patients with multidrug-resistant TB in  Europe , and treat at
least 75 percent of them by 2015, the Geneva-based WHO said.
They will commit to national action plans that include dedicated
facilities and improved public awareness, according to the
agency. Of about 81,000 cases in 2009, the WHO estimates 34
percent were diagnosed and 22 percent were treated adequately.  Achieving the goals may prevent as many as 263,000 cases of
drug-resistant TB, saving 120,000 lives and $5 billion in lost
productivity. A further $7 billion may be saved by averting
future cases, the WHO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
