Philippine Bureau of Customs Deputy
Commissioner Danilo Lim pledged to plug “loopholes” in the
agency seeking to curb smuggling and bolster revenue as he took
his oath before President  Benigno Aquino  today.  “The president’s instruction to me is clear; help raise
collections, stop corruption, and fight smuggling,” said Lim,
56, a retired general involved in several military coup attempts
against previous administrations, including that of the late
President  Corazon Aquino .  To contact the reporter on this story:
