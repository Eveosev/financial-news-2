Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. , a
Hong Kong-based investment firm, agreed to raise its stake in
 Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group Plc (JLT)  to 40 percent as it seeks to
boost the insurance broker’s “competitive position.”  Jardine Matheson, which owns 30 percent of JLT, will pay
765 pence a share in cash, or 166.3 million pounds ($262
million), for a 10 percent stake, the companies said today in a
joint statement. That’s 24 percent higher than the London-based
stock’s closing price of 619 pence on Sept. 14.  “This is a good deal for shareholders,”  Barrie Cornes , a
London-based analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co. with a “hold”
rating on the stock said today in a note to clients. “We view
it as a vote of confidence in the business but it will remove
any bid speculation in the share price.”  JLT, the U.K.’s biggest publicly traded insurance broker,
has made at least 26 acquisitions in the last four years to
expand in developing markets and into more specialist business
lines. About 19 percent of the company’s profit is generated in
 Latin America  and  China , Chief Executive Officer Dominic Burke
said in July.  JLT rose 7.1 percent to 663 pence in London trading today,
the most since March 2009. That values the company at about 1.4
billion pounds.  “JLT is a core strategic investment of the Jardine
Matheson Group and the partial offer reinforces our commitment
to the stability, independence and long-term growth of JLT,”
Anthony Nightingale, managing director of Jardine Matheson said
in the statement.  JLT was created as a division of Jardine Matheson in 1972.
Jardine Insurance Brokers, as it was known at the time, listed
on the London Stock Exchange in 1991 and merged with Lloyd
Thompson in 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
