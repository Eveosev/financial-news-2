     Sept. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS, the
Turkish bank part-owned by  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , rose in Istanbul after
Finanza & Mercati newspaper said UniCredit is studying asset
sales including Yapi Kredi.  Yapi Kredi, which is the biggest provider of credit cards
in  Turkey , gained as much as 10 kurus, or 2.8 percent, to 3.74
liras. The share rose 1.7 percent to 3.70 liras at 5:30 p.m.,
valuing UniCredit’s 40 percent stake at 6.4 billion liras ($3.6
billion.)  The report in F&M is “groundless,” UniCredit spokesman
Andrea Morawski said by telephone. UniCredit has no plans to
exit Turkey, Yapi Kredi Chief Executive Officer Faik Acikalin
told Bloomberg HT news channel today.  UniCredit partners  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , Turkey’s biggest
company, in the Yapi Kredi joint venture. UniCredit is among
foreign banks including Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc
that have bought stakes in Turkish banks over the past decade,
to operate in an economy that’s growing more than three times
the pace of  Europe .  UniCredit may get more than 7 billion euros ($9.6 billion)
for Yapi Kredi and Bank Pekao SA of  Poland , Finanza & Mercati
reported, without saying where it got the information. That may
reduce the amount UniCredit will seek in a capital increase to
as little as 3 billion euros from as much as 10 billion euros,
the newspaper said.  Speculation that UniCredit may sell its Yapi Kredi stake
has surfaced since the financial crisis. Yapi Kredi denied
UniCredit planned to sell its shares after a report in 2008 in
Turkey’s Vatan newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
