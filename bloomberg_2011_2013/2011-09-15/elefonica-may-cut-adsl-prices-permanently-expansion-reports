Telefonica SA (TEF)  extended its low-cost
offer for ADSL broadband and may make it permanent as a way to
stop losing customers to competitors,  Expansion  reported, citing
unidentified people at the company.  The operator, which lost 153,365 ADSL customers from
January to July, has extended an offer that allows customers
with a Movistar mobile to get ADSL service for 24.90 euros
($34.19) a month and that could become a permanent offer, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
