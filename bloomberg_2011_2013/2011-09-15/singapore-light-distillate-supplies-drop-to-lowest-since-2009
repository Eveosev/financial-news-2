Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center, fell
7.9 percent to the lowest in 31 months, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore supplies including naphtha, gasoline and reformate
dropped 721,000 barrels to 8.436 million in the week to
yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today in an
e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest since the seven days ended
Feb. 11, 2009.  Stockpiles of middle distillates including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene gained 868,000 barrels, or 7.2 percent, to
12.849 million. Supplies rebounded from the lowest in 15 weeks,
according to the ministry’s data.  Residual-fuel stockpiles in onshore tanks increased 270,000
barrels, or 1.3 percent, from the previous week to 21.275
million. This category includes  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excludes bitumen.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
