The European Union will extend its
temporary state-aid rules for banks beyond the end of 2011,
 Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s competition commissioner, said.  Current market conditions mean the rules need to be
prolonged, Almunia said at the Eurofi financial forum in
Wroclaw,  Poland , today. He will make a proposal to do this in
the next “couple of months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
