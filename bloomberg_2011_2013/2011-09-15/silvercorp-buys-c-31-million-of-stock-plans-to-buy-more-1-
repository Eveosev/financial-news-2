Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM) , the Chinese
miner accused of fraud, said it bought C$31.2 million ($31.6
million) of its own shares and plans to buy more after being
targeted by short sellers.  “The company is purchasing its owns shares because it
believes that prevailing market conditions have resulted in
Silvercorp’s shares being undervalued relative to the immediate
and long-term value of Silvercorp’s portfolio of producing and
development properties,” the Vancouver-based silver miner said
today in a statement.  A group of short sellers is attacking the company by
publishing “false, selective or ignorant statements and
rumors,” Silvercorp said this week. The company previously
denied an Aug. 29 anonymous letter that said Silvercorp reported
a profit in 2010 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
while posting a loss to regulators in  China .  Muddy Waters LLC, Carson Block’s research firm, said Sept.
13 it was shorting Silvercorp after a negative report on the
mining company by Alfredlittle.com, a website that posts
research on companies doing business in China.  Silvercorp plans to buy as many as 10 million more shares,
the company said in today’s statement.  Silvercorp rose 42 cents, or 6.6 percent, to C$6.89 at 9:31
a.m. in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Donville in
