Jet fuel and diesel in  New York 
Harbor rose after Colonial Pipeline Co. allocated shipments on a
line moving distillates from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast.  Colonial allocated shipments yesterday on Line 2, cycle 54,
according to a bulletin to shippers. The company also restarted
pipelines in Alabama that were shut as a precaution because of
an earthquake, according to an earlier bulletin.  The premium for jet fuel versus heating oil futures in New
York Harbor traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose 1.25
cents to 4.5 cents at 3:26 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 9.21 cents to $3.0696 a
gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel at the same hub
increased 0.13 cent to 3.38 cents a gallon versus futures. Itâ€™s
the second consecutive gain.  BP Plc is planning to flare gas at its Carson oil refinery
in  California  for four days starting today, according to a
filing with the South Coast Air Quality Management District.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
 Los Angeles  gained 4 cents to 18.75 cents a gallon. Prompt
delivery rose 10.42 cents to $2.9775.  To contact the reporter on this story:
