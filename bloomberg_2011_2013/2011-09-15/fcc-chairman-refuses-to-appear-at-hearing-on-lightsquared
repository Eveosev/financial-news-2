Federal Communications Commission
Chairman  Julius Genachowski  refused to appear at a hearing today
into Philip Falcone’s LightSquared wireless service, a lawmaker
said.  “I consider the chairman’s failure to show up today to be
an affront to the House Armed Services Committee,” U.S.
Representative Michael Turner, an Ohio Republican, said at a
hearing before the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.  The subcommittee agreed to accept the chairman’s designee
at the hearing, Tammy Sun, an FCC spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail. “We never said that the chairman would not appear,” Sun
said.  The FCC’s scheduled witness today was Julius Knapp, chief
of the agency’s technology office -- “the FCC’s top technical
expert,” according to Sun.  “I’m not really concerned” that Genachowski didn’t
appear, said Representative Loretta Sanchez, a California
Democrat. Genachowski met last week with Sanchez and Turner,
Sanchez said.  LightSquared needs federal approval to commence commercial
service with its network that is to eventually offer high-speed
wireless Internet to 260 million people.  The company envisions offering wholesale service through a
network of 40,000 base stations using airwaves previously
reserved mainly for satellites. Makers and users of GPS devices,
which rely on satellite signals, say LightSquared’s network
would disrupt navigation by planes, boats, tractors and
automobiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
