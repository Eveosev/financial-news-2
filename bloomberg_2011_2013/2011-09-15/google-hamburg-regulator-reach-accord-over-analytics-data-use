Google Inc. (GOOG)  and the Hamburg privacy
regulator reached an accord over the use of data by the search
engine’s Analytics function in  Europe .  Google will expand a deactivation add-on allowing users to
object to data gathering for all browsers, regulator Johannes
Caspar said in a statement on his website today. Website owners
can ask Google not to store their complete IP-addresses within
Europe. The  Mountain View , California-based firm also agreed to
enter into data-administration contracts with website owners as
provided by German law, Caspar said.  “We are at the end of a long but constructive discussion
process,” said Casper. “I explicitly welcome that Google has
said it will implement the changes Europe-wide.”  Analytics is a tool offered by Google that counts and
analyzes website traffic. German state privacy regulators have
voiced concerns over the service and asked the Hamburg regulator
to negotiate with Google, Casper said. Talks started in 2009.  Google disagrees with regulators who say its Analytics tool
violates data-protection rules, the company said in a  blog post .
The search-engine company worked with German authorities on
their concerns and implemented changes, Google said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
