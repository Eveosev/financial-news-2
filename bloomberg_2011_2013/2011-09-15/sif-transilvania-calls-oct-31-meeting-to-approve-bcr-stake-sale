Transilvania SA called for a general shareholders’ meeting on
Oct. 31 on the sale of its minority stake in  Romania ’s biggest
bank, Banca Comerciala Romana SA, to its owner  Erste Group Bank

of its Romanian unit, as stipulated in the bank’s initial
privatization contract, the fund said in a statement sent to the
