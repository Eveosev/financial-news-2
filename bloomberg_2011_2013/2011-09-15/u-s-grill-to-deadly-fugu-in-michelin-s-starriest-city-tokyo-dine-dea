Tokyo boasts the most Michelin
stars of any city in the world, with more of the coveted awards
than Paris and New York combined.  Japan ’s capital has about 160,000 restaurants, according to
the guide -- enough to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner in a
different place each day for 146 years.  Discovering the best places in this culinary cornucopia can
take you from the swankiest hotels to inconspicuous eateries
down tiny side streets. Here are our 12 choices, in alphabetical
order, for business dining in the city.  1. Argo: 1-4-2 Kojimachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. Information:

Imperial Palace during the day, and at night of the lights of
the Marunouchi district. Chef Atsushi Yamashita’s talent for
presentation adds to his cooking skill.  Where: Directly across the Hanzomon Gate of the Imperial
Palace.  When: Best during the cherry-blossom viewing season in

view of Tokyo Bay. The interior is decorated with contemporary
art.  When: Dinner.  Bar: No.  Private Room: No.  Sound level: Subdued murmur of conversations revolving

residence. If you get lost, ask one of the many policemen.  When: Dinner with friends or colleagues.  Bar: No.  Private Room: Yes.  Sound level: Shabu-shabu is a very social type of dining
and consequently, there’s a lot of laughter here.  4. Kyubey: 8-7-6 Ginza Chuo-ku, Tokyo. Information:
+81-3-3571-6523;  http://www.kyubey.jp   What: Sushi.  Why: A Ginza institution, founded in 1935, Kyubey serves

chome.  When: Good lunch place at the counter or for formal
dinners.  Bar: No.  Private Room: Several, for up to 24 people.  Sound level: The sushi chefs like to banter with the

they are “Lost in Translation,” or want to be.  Where: 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt Hotel in Shinjuku.  When: Whenever.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: No.  Sound level: About as close to  New York  sound levels as
you’ll get in Tokyo.  6. Omotesando Ukai-tei: 5th Floor, Gyre Building, 5-10-1

to the main grill room.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: Yes.  Sound level: While there are private rooms, most diners are

ability to balance flavors.  Where: A quiet neighborhood in Shirokanedai.  When: When you can get a reservation. The waiting list is
up to two months long.  Bar: No.  Private Room: Yes.  Sound level: Lots of friendly chatter. The long wait to get
a reservation gives the restaurant the feel of an exclusive club

tendency to start conversations.  8. Ryugin: 1st Floor, Side Roponggi Building, 7-17-24 Roppongi,
Minato-ku, Tokyo. Information: Fax: +81-3-3423-8003;

Tokyo. Information: +81-3-3517-5700;  http://www.santpau.jp   What: Whimsical dishes with Spanish roots. Cheese disguised
as firecrackers, a so-called upside-down pizza.  Why: Good food with a twist.  Where: Behind the Coredo shopping complex.  When: Lighthearted date.  Bar: Yes.  Private Room: Yes.  Sound level: There’s lots of room, so patrons are seated

+81-3-3571-1968.  What: Sushi.  Why: One of Ginza’s oldest sushi shops, with more than 120
