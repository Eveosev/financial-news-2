French banks don’t need to raise
fresh capital and are “solid,” Bank of France Governor
 Christian Noyer  said in an interview with Les Echos newspaper.  Declines in banking stocks recently stem from U.S. mutual
funds pulling out from Europe, Noyer said.  He also said European banks are readjusting their dollar
activities.  Separately, Noyer, who’s also a governing council member of
the  European Central Bank , said Greece has nothing to gain from
a default.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
