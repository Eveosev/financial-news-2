Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said the economy will grow more than 2 percent in the
fiscal year beginning in April 2012 as the country rebuilds from
the March earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis.  "The economy will grow strongly from later this year, and
grow 2.5 percent or more in the fiscal 2012," Noda said today in
 parliament . "There are downside concerns from overseas factors
such as European sovereign credit risks, the weak U.S. economic
recovery and as the strong yen."  While the world’s third largest economy remains in a
"severe state" from the March disaster, it is recovering as
manufacturers restore supply-chain disruptions, Noda said.  Japan ’s gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 1.3
percent rate in the three months ended June 30, marking three
consecutive quarters of declines, the Cabinet office said last
month. The median forecast of 25 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a 2.5 percent drop.  The yen has risen 5.8 percent this year against the dollar,
reaching a post-World War II record of 75.95 per dollar on Aug.
19. The yen traded at 76.68 at 1:39 p.m. in  Tokyo  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
