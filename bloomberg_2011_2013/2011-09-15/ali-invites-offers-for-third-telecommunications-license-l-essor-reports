Mali’s government is inviting bids
for a third telecommunications license and is expected to make a
decision within two months, state-owned L’Essor newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Submissions will be allowed from Sept. 19 to Oct. 11, with
the handing over of bid documents set for Nov. 14, according to
the newspaper. The payment of license charges is expected to be
completed by the end of November, L’Essor said.  Orange and Sotelma-Malitel are the two incumbent operators
in the African nation, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
