Sam Bradford  will probably recover
from an injury to his throwing hand in time to lead the  St.
Louis Rams  against the  New York Giants  in the second week of the
National Football League season.  The quarterback, the 2008 Heisman Trophy winner who was the
top pick in last year’s draft, took part in yesterday’s workout
even though the original plan called for him to sit out and
return to throwing today. Bradford bruised his index finger
during a season-opening loss to the  Philadelphia Eagles .  “It looks like he’s going to be okay,” Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo told reporters. “It would be the understatement of
the year to say it’s a relief. I think our whole football team,
everybody feels that way.”  Rams running back Steven Jackson missed practice yesterday
with a strained quadriceps muscle and his status for the Sept.
19 game against  New York  hasn’t been determined.  Bradford lost feeling in his finger after the injury,
causing concern there may have been nerve damage. After finding
it was a bone bruise, he underwent treatment that included ice,
rest and a glove that sends electrical currents into the
affected area.  “The hand feels 10 times better than it did on Sunday,
even on Monday morning after the game, that’s encouraging,”
Bradford said. “Hopefully, it continues to get better and
hopefully it will be 100 percent by Monday.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
