The European Union should build a
bank resolution fund so it can avoid crisis contagion between
banks and their home-country governments, European Banking
Authority Chairman Andrea Enria said.  When national budgets are responsible for bank rescues,
banks and their sovereigns are connected in ways that have
contributed to the euro-area debt crisis, Enria wrote in an
article distributed at the Eurofi financial forum in Wroclaw,
 Poland , today.  Banks and supervisors need to work together across borders,
through stronger legal frameworks than the current voluntary
approach, he said.  “The establishment of an EU-wide resolution fund, or a
close European system of resolution funds, financed ex ante
through contributions of cross-border groups, would be a major
step forward,” Enria said. “This should be implemented over
the long perspective -- say 10 years -- in order to allow for
enough time to gradually build up the capacity of the fund and
to strengthen supervisory convergence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
