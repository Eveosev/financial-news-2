Default notices sent to delinquent
U.S. homeowners surged 33 percent in August from the previous
month, a sign that lenders are speeding up the foreclosure
process after almost a year of delays, RealtyTrac Inc. said.  First-time default notices were filed on 78,880 properties,
the most in nine months, the Irvine, California-based data
seller said today in a  report . Total foreclosure filings, which
also include auction and home-seizure notices, increased 7
percent from a four-year low in July to 228,098. One in 570
homes received a notice during August.  On a year-over-year basis, foreclosure filings dropped for
an 11th straight month after claims of “robo-signing,” or
pushing through documents that weren’t verified, spurred an
investigation by state attorneys general in October. The jump in
default notices from July -- the biggest monthly gain in four
years -- shows that banks’ paperwork delays are easing even as
industry talks to settle the probe continue, RealtyTrac said.  “The industry seems to be hitting the reset button and the
logjam may finally be breaking up,”  Rick Sharga , senior vice
president, said in a telephone interview. Foreclosure filings
this year have been “artificially low,” he said.  Total filings in August dropped 33 percent from a year
earlier. Default notices fell 18 percent, while scheduled
auctions slid 43 percent from August 2010 and 1 percent from the
previous month.  Home Seizures  Lenders seized 64,813 properties in August, a 4 percent
decline from the previous month and a 32 percent slump from a
year earlier, according to RealtyTrac. The jump in default
notices means repossessions probably will increase in coming
months as more foreclosures are processed, Sharga said.  Default notices increased from July by 55 percent in
 California , 46 percent in  Indiana  and 42 percent in  New Jersey ,
according to  RealtyTrac . Nine of 10 metropolitan areas with the
highest rate of filings per household also had double-digit
increases.  Scheduled auctions increased in some states where they
serve as the first step in the foreclosure process, climbing 51
percent from the previous month in Colorado, 22 percent in
Georgia, 20 percent in Arizona and 19 percent in Oregon,
RealtyTrac said.  Nevada, California  Nevada had the highest foreclosure rate, with one in 118
households receiving a filing, followed by California at one in
226 and Arizona at one in 248. Georgia, Idaho,  Michigan ,
 Florida ,  Illinois , Colorado and Utah rounded out the top 10.  In  Las Vegas , where default notices jumped 30 percent from
July, one in every 103 households received a foreclosure filing.
That was more than five times the national average.  California led in total filings with 59,383 and Florida was
second at 23,569. Michigan ranked third at 13,016, Illinois was
fourth at 12,493 and Georgia was fifth at 11,743. The five
states accounted for 53 percent of all foreclosure filings in
the country, according to RealtyTrac, which sells default data
from more than 2,200 counties representing 90 percent of the
U.S. population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
