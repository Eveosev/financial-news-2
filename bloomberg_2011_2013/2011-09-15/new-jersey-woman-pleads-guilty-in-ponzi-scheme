A  New Jersey  woman who stole
$2 million from investors in a Ponzi scheme and then used some
of the money for a cruise and luxury goods pleaded guilty to
 wire fraud , federal prosecutors said.  Jenifer Devine, 39, of Fair Lawn, entered the plea today
before U.S. District Judge Claire C. Cecchi in  Newark , U.S.
Attorney Paul J. Fishman said in a statement. She faces as long
as 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the amount
of her gain or victimsâ€™ loss as a result of her criminal conduct
at her Dec. 20 sentencing, according to the statement.  Devine was arrested in November and accused of soliciting
investors from New Jersey and elsewhere in the U.S. from
December 2008 to September 2010, telling them that she would use
their money to fund a wholesale clothing and electronics
business and promising returns of as much as 25 percent,
prosecutors said.  More than 15 investors sent more than $8 million to Devine,
who used the money to make principal and interest payments to
existing investors and for personal expenses -- including a
Royal Caribbean cruise and purchases at luxury retailers such as
Burberry, Coach and Gucci, prosecutors said.  The case is U.S. vs. Devine, 11-cr-00613, U.S. District
Court, District of New Jersey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
