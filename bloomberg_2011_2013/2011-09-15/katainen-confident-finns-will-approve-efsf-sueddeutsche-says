Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  is confident that parliament will approve the European
Financial Stability Facility,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported,
citing an interview with him.  The collateral demanded by Finland in exchange for the
second Greek bailout could be “very innovative” and an
agreement must be found in a few weeks at the latest, Katainen
said, according to the German newspaper.  The Finnish prime minister said “radical reforms” such as
joint euro bonds are not a solution and it’s “good” that
meetings of governments in the  euro zone  excluding those that
don’t have the common currency will be formalized, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
