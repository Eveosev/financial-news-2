India ’s government rejected a
protest by China over oil and gas exploration by ONGC Videsh
Ltd. in the disputed South China Sea, the Hindustan Times said,
citing the Ministry of External Affairs in  New Delhi .  China sent a diplomatic note to India stating that any
exploration in Blocks 127 and 128 off Vietnam’s coast without
permission would be illegal, the paper said. China’s objections
lacked legal basis as the blocks belong to Vietnam, the paper
said, citing a ministry official that it didn’t identify.  Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry in
Beijing, said that while she wasn’t aware of any protest,
foreign oil companies should avoid becoming entangled in
territorial disputes in the  South China Sea . She reiterated that
China has indisputable rights in the waters it claims, which
include parts of the blocks in question.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
