Copper may rise on speculation that
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is on course for a resolution, a
survey showed.  Six of 11 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 55 percent, said prices will gain next week. Four
predicted a drop and one forecast little change. Copper for
three-month delivery was down 1.3 percent for this week at
$8,710 a metric ton by 5 p.m. yesterday on the London Metal
Exchange.  Copper climbed yesterday as the  European Central Bank  said
it would ally with the  Federal Reserve  and other central banks
to lend dollars to euro-area banks. Reports next week may show a
gauge of U.S. leading economic indicators gained for a fourth
month in August and sales of existing homes rose, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Copper seems to be in a good support zone at current
prices,”  Donald Selkin , chief market strategist at National
Securities Corp. in  New York , said by e-mail Sept. 14. Prices
“could rebound on any better economic news and any progress
toward resolution of the European debt issues,” he said.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of Sept. 9.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
75 of the past 154 weeks, or 49 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 6 Bearish: 4 Hold: 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
