Grolsch, a unit of  SABMiller Plc (SAB) ,
the world’s second-largest brewer by volume, won a European
Union court appeal of a 31.7 million-euro ($43.8 million) fine
levied for colluding on beer prices in the Netherlands.  Antitrust officials lacked sufficient proof to “establish
the direct participation of Grolsch” in the cartel, the EU
General Court, the region’s second-highest tribunal, said in a
ruling today.  The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust regulator,
fined Royal Grolsch NV,  Heineken NV (HEIA)  and Bavaria NV in 2007 for
fixing prices in the Netherlands from at least 1996 to 1999.
InBev NV, which has since merged with Anheuser-Busch Cos. to
become the world’s largest brewer, escaped a fine after tipping
off EU officials. Grolsch was bought by SABMiller in a takeover
completed in 2008.  Heineken won a cut to its fine to 198 million euros from
219.3 million euros in a ruling by the EU court in June. Bavaria
had its penalty trimmed to 20.7 million euros from 22.8 million
euros, after the court said the European Commission failed to
prove the extent of the cartel.  The commission will “analyze the ruling carefully” and
will then consider whether to appeal the judgment or readopt the
cartel decision, Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the EU
regulator, said in an e-mail.  The case is: T-234/07, Koninklijke Grolsch v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
