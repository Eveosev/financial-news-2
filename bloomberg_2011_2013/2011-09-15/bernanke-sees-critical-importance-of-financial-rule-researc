Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said research into the causes of the financial crisis
and regulation of risks that may lead to a repeat are of
“critical importance.”  The research can inform the making of regulations and
policies, “and I suspect no one in this audience needs to be
convinced that we must get this right,” Bernanke said today in
the text of brief opening remarks at a conference hosted by the
central bank in Washington.  The Fed chief didn’t comment on the economic outlook or
monetary policy, including what steps, if any, the Fed may take
at its Sept. 20-21 meeting to bolster economic growth.  Bernanke has previously said regulators are working
together to implement the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which
overhauls financial rules. It aims to prevent another financial
panic like the one that followed the September 2008 bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
