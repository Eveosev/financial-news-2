India ’s rupee strengthened for the
first time in nine days on speculation European leaders will
contain the region’s debt crisis and spur demand for emerging-
market assets.  The currency pared earlier losses as Asian stocks gained
after French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said Greece will stay in the euro zone, easing
concern over a Greek default. The rupee also gained on
speculation the central bank will raise  interest rates  at a
review tomorrow, said Sudarshan Bhatt, chief currency trader at
state-owned  Corporation Bank .  “The positive news out of Europe helped support the rupee
against the dollar,” Mumbai-based Bhatt said. “The Sensex also
rose, increasing optimism on foreign inflows.”  The rupee gained 0.2 percent to 47.555 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
rebounding from the day’s low of 47.91. It dropped to 48.01
yesterday, the lowest level since Sept. 29, 2009, before paring
losses on speculation the central bank sold dollars.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares rose 1.44 percent and
the BSE India Ltd.’s Sensitive Index advanced 1 percent. The
 Reserve Bank  of India will raise borrowing costs by 25 basis
points, or 0.25 percentage point, tomorrow, according to 14 of
17 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Three expect no change.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 48.25 in
three months, compared with expectations of 48.27 yesterday.
