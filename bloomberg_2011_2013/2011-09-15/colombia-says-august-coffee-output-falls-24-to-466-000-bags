Colombia , the second-largest
supplier of Arabica coffee after  Brazil , said exports fell to
their lowest level since 1988 in August after storms battered
crops.  Exports fell 38 percent to 374,000 bags from 599,000 bags
in August 2010, according to a statement today from  Colombia’s
National Federation of Coffee Growers  in Bogota. The figure is
the lowest since Colombia exported 347,000 bags in Sept. 1988,
according to the federation’s data. Output fell 24 percent to a
two-year low.  Lower exports from Colombia have contributed to a 39
percent rally in coffee in  New York  in 12 months. Storms last
year that damaged flowering reduced production last month, the
federation said. Output slid to 466,000 bags from 615,000 bags a
year earlier, the lowest monthly level since August 2009.  Production should increase this month and recover until the
end of the year after the weather improved, according to the
statement.  In August, growers trimmed production forecasts for the
year by about 5.6 percent to 9 million bags. The federation in
May had forecast output of about 9.5 million bags.  Rising coffee prices reflect how higher farming costs are
starting to be passed onto consumers, the federation’s Chief
Executive Officer Luis Munoz said in May. Consumers will have to
get used to higher prices because of higher demand and reduced
supply, he said then.
