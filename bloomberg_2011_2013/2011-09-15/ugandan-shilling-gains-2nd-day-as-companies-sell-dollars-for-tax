Uganda’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in 2011, climbed for a second day as
companies sold dollars to pay mid-month taxes.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
appreciated 0.1 percent to 2,780 per dollar at 1:59 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, after closing at 2,783 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Major companies are paying mid-month value-added tax,
which is made on the 15th day of the month,” Taib Lubega, a
currency trader at Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd., said by phone from
Kampala.  The Ugandan shilling, which fell as low as 2,830 a dollar
on Aug. 26, the weakest since 1993, has declined 17 percent this
year against the dollar, making it the world’s worst-performing
currency during the period.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8 percent in
July, the  Uganda  Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
