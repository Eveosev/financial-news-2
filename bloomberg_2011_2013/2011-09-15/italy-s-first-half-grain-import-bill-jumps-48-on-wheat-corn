Italy , the world’s second-largest
wheat buyer, paid 48 percent more to import grain in the first
half of 2011 on higher wheat and corn prices, according to the
national cereal-industry association.  The value of inbound shipments jumped to 1.8 billion euros
($2.5 billion) from 1.22 billion euros a year earlier, the Rome-
based Associazione Nazionale Cerealisti, known as Anacer, said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The inflation rate in Italy, the euro region’s third-
biggest economy, was unchanged in June from the previous month
at 3 percent, remaining at the highest level since October 2008
amid rising food prices. Wheat prices in  Chicago  were up 28
percent from a year earlier at the end of June and corn advanced
66 percent, increasing costs for importers.  The volume of Italian grain imports rose 6.7 percent to 6.3
million metric tons in the half from 5.91 million tons a year
earlier, Anacer said.  Italy imported 7.35 million tons of wheat in the marketing
year through June, based on Anacer figures. That would make the
country the world’s second-biggest buyer of the grain behind
 Egypt , which purchased 10.5 million tons in the period,
International Grains Council figures show.  Italians include more wheat products such as bread and
pasta in their diet than the French, Germans, Americans or
British,  data  from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
Center show.  Durum Wheat  Soft-wheat import volumes of 2.29 million tons were little
changed in the half from the year-earlier 2.3 million tons,
while shipments surged 70 percent by value to 601.9 million
euros. Imports of durum wheat, the hard variety used in pasta,
fell to 998,633 tons from 1.03 million tons by volume as the
cost rose 24 percent to 269.3 million euros, the data showed.  Italy’s wheat imports rose to an eight-year high in 2010 as
domestic output fell.  First-half corn imports rose 39 percent from a year earlier
to 1.56 million tons in volume terms and more than doubled to
334.7 million euros by value, Anacer said.  Including oilseed and protein-crop products, the value of
Italy’s imports increased 34 percent to 2.58 billion euros in
the period from 1.93 billion euros.  Italian cereal-industry exports were 1.44 billion euros
from January to June, compared with 1.26 billion euros a year
earlier, Anacer said. That resulted in a grain-industry trade
deficit of 1.14 billion euros, widening from the prior year’s
671.3 million-euro shortfall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
