Jilin Pharmaceutical Co. shares
fell by their daily limit in Shenzhen after the stock resumed
trading following a July 20 suspension.  The shares fell 5 percent, the daily limit for so-called
special-treatment stocks, to 10.70 yuan, as of 10:45 a.m. on the
Shenzhen stock exchange.  The company said in a statement to the exchange after
markets closed yesterday that it wasn’t able to initiate a
“major asset reorganization” within a certain required period
of time and will give up further efforts related to the
reorganization for at least three months.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
