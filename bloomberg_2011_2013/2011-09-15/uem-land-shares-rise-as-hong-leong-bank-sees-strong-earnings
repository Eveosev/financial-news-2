(Corrects company name in headline, first paragraph.)  United Malayan Land Bhd. (UML) , a
Malaysian developer, has “strong” earnings upside as profits
from some projects haven’t been factored into its share price,
Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd. analyst Sean Lim said in a
report today.  Hong Leong has a “buy” call on the stock with a 2.30
ringgit share estimate, the report said. United Malayan was
unchanged at 1.30 ringgit at 9:42 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
