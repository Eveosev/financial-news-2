While Poland’s government is
“conscious” of the risks posed by slowing economic growth in
the euro area, there’s no reason for now to revise the 2012
budget’s forecast that the economy will expand by 4 percent,
Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski told reporters today in
Wroclaw.  The zloty is reacting to global market developments and its
current levels aren’t justified by the economic fundamentals,
Rostowski said. He added that further depreciation of the
currency poses a potential inflation risk that the Polish
central bank has taken into account in its strategy for next
year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
