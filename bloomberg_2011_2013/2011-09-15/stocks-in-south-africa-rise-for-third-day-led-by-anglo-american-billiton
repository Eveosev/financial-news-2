The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
closed at its highest in two weeks as it rose for a third day,
gaining 538.23, or 1.8 percent, to 30,998.05 by the 5 p.m. close
in Johannesburg.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , closed at its
highest in six weeks, advancing 9.45 rand, or 3.3 percent, to
292.50 rand. The group plans to start construction work at its
$3 billion Quellaveco copper deposit in  Peru  next year, country
manager Luis Marchese said. Separately, copper rose in  New York ,
rebounding from the lowest close since Nov. 30, as concerns
about  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis eased further after the
 European Central Bank  said it will lend dollars to euro-area
banks.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s largest mining
group, climbed for a third day, gaining 5.02 rand, or 2.2
percent, to 233 rand.  Datatec Ltd. (DTC)  , a Johannesburg-based computer
services company, surged to its highest in more than two weeks,
adding 61 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 39.06 rand. The company said
earnings per share rose to as much as 20 cents in the six months
through August compared with 8.8 cents a year earlier. The
company plans to pay an interim dividend in addition to a final
payout. Separately, HSBC rated Datatec “overweight” with a
price estimate of 48 rand in new coverage.  First Uranium Corp. (FUM)  , a Toronto-based company that
mines gold and uranium, closed at its lowest since it started
trading on the JSE in April 2007, slumping 15 cents, or 4.9
percent, to 2.94 rand.  South Africa  postponed the opening of
bids for its nuclear power-plant build program to next year
because of safety concerns following the meltdown of reactors in
Fukushima,  Japan , South African Energy Minister Dipuo Peters
said. Separately, the company was downgraded to “market
perform” from “outperform” at BMO Capital Markets by equity
analyst Edward Sterck with a 12-month price estimate of 50
Canadian cents per share.        Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , the continent’s second-biggest
gold producer, fell the most in more than three weeks, declining
1.98 rand, or 1.6 percent, to 123.27 rand. Gold dropped to a
two-week low on signs that European banks will have enough cash
through year-end, easing concern that the region’s debt crisis
will worsen and eroding demand for the metal as an alternative
asset.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), the continent’s third-
largest gold company, dropped 3.04 rand, or 3.2 percent, to
93.02 rand.  Investec Ltd. (INL SJ), a bank and money manager, rose the
most in a week, gaining 75 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 48.60 rand.
The group said four of its six operating units showed improved
performances in the first six months of its financial year.  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  , South Africa’s largest insurer and
the third-biggest insurer in the U.K., closed at a one-week
high, adding 27 cents, or 2.1 percent, to 13.40 rand. Skandia
Investment Group, Old Mutual’s U.K.-based fund-management
division, aims to double the amount of assets its manages
worldwide to $30 billion within three years, according to Chief
Investment Officer James Millard.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  , the world’s second-largest brewer
by volume, closed at its highest since at least Jan. 1995,
advancing 4.37 rand, or 1.7 percent, to 262.47 rand. The
company’s Grolsch unit won a European Union court appeal of a
31.7 million-euro ($43.6 million) fine levied for colluding on
beer prices in the Netherlands.  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  , South Africa’s largest
retailer by market value, gained the most in a week, rising 2.26
rand, or 2 percent, to 115.45 rand. The retailer is expanding in
Mauritius with the acquisition of two new supermarkets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
