Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  repeated warnings that the
world economy is in a “dangerous new phase” as policy makers
fail to take the necessary measures to boost confidence.  “Exactly three years after the collapse of  Lehman
Brothers , the economic skies look troubled and turbulent as
global activity slows and downside risks increase,” Lagarde
said in the prepared remarks for a speech in  Washington .
“Without collective resolve, the confidence that the world so
badly needs will not return.”  Lagarde, who took over the IMF leadership on July 5, said
there’s too much debt in advanced economies, from governments to
banks in  Europe , and for householders in the U.S. The
uncertainty adds to weak growth, fueling a vicious circle that
is exacerbated by policy indecision, she said.  After almost two years combating the sovereign debt crisis
focused on  Greece , Ireland and Portugal, European policy makers
have yet to reassure investors demanding higher yields from
nations such as Spain and Italy. The European Central Bank today
said it will lend dollars to euro-area banks in three separate
three-month loans to ensure they have enough of the U.S.
currency through the end of the year.  European nations must implement “credible fiscal
consolidation” to face their rising borrowing costs, Lagarde
said. Banks in the region need to make sure they have the
sufficient capital buffers, she said.  -- Editors: Kevin Costelloe, Christopher Wellisz  To contact the reporter on this story:
