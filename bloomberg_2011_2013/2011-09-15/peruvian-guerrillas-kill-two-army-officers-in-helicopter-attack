Two Peruvian army officers were
killed after guerrillas attacked a military helicopter in one of
the country’s main cocaine-producing areas, President  Ollanta Humala  said today.  Another officer who was injured in the shootout in the Ene-
Apurimac valley yesterday, was flown to a hospital, Humala told
reporters in Lima.  The area, which straddles Peru’s southern Andes and Amazon
jungle, produces a third of the country’s coca, a native plant
that’s the basis of cocaine. Remnants of the Shining Path Maoist
rebel group, which waged war against the Peruvian state during
the 1980s and early 1990s, now provide security to drug-
traffickers that have made Peru the world’s top cocaine
exporter.  “We condemn this barbaric and insane act by people who
think they are going to change the will of the Peruvian people
through violence,” said Humala, a former lieutenant colonel.
“These are people who think they can implant a way of life we
reject.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
