Sugar may fall next week on concern
that a slowing European economy will erode demand for the
sweetener.  Six of 11 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar in New York will fall, three said
it would rise, and two were neutral. Before today, the contract
for March delivery rose 2 percent this week to 28.18 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S.  Five respondents said refined sugar on  London ’s NYSE Liffe
will decline, four said it would rise, and two expected little
change. The December contract gained 1.8 percent to $717.60 a
metric ton this week through yesterday.  Seven respondents said refined-sugar’s premium over raw
would widen, two that it would narrow and two were neutral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
