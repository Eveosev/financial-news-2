Greece’s latest package of
austerity measures goes “a long way” toward meeting its 2011
deficit target, European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  “Last weekend, the Greek government took very important
decisions that go a long way toward meeting the fiscal target
for this year,” Rehn told reporters today in Brussels. “It is
now essential that they convince their partners so that we can
expect a decision to be taken by the euro area and the IMF in
time before the next hurdles of financing will emerge.”  The Greek government on Sept. 11 approved new measures to
help plug the budget gap. The Cabinet voted to cut one month’s
wages from elected officials and impose an annual charge on all
property for two years, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos
said.  “The ball is now in the Greek court,” Rehn said today.
“It is essential that  Greece  will take the necessary decisions
and fully fill the fiscal gap that has emerged in the course of
this year” and which was due to “both some lack of
implementation and some lower growth outlook.”  “In the eurogroup tomorrow, they will certainly have a
discussion as regards the Greek measures and in case that is
convincing then the review mission in full could return to
 Athens ,” Rehn said. “And we should be able to conclude work by
the end of September, again on the condition that Greece will
meet all the conditions that we have set to conclude the
review” and then “proceed to the disbursement of the sixth
tranche” of international aid, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
