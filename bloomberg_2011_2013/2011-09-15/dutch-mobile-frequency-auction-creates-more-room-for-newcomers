The Dutch government will create
more room for newcomers in the mobile-phone frequency auction
next year to increase competition and reduce prices for
consumers, Minister of Economic Affairs Maxime Verhagen said.  Licenses for mobile-phone frequencies in the 800 megahertz
band, currently held by Royal KPN NV and the Dutch units of
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , are set to expire in
2013.  To drive competition, the government will reserve a third
of that bandwidth for newcomers, and will also make space on the
900 megahertz frequency, Verhagen said in a debate on the
telecommunications industry in The Hague today. The government
previously said it would create room for new competitors on the
800 megahertz bandwidth.  KPN said the new auction rules are unfavorable for
consumers and companies. “Too much room in the limited
frequency bandwidth is reserved for newcomers, and it is the
question to what extent these parties can invest in the
network,” the company said in an e-mailed statement.  Vodafone will investigate the effect of the decision on the
services the company provides on 900 megahertz bandwidth, said
Joost Galema, a spokesman.  The Dutch government has said it expects  Tele2 AB (TEL2B)  and Ziggo
BV, in a joint venture with  Liberty Global Inc (LBTYA) ’s Dutch unit UPC,
to take part in the auction.  In an auction last year for 2.6 gigahertz frequencies, for
fourth-generation networks, more than half of the licenses were
sold to the Ziggo joint venture with UPC and Tele2 AB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
