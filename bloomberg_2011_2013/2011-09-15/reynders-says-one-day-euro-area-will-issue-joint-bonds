Belgian Finance Minister  Didier
Reynders  said Europe must plan for the medium term, “and in the
medium term we can’t escape more fiscal integration.”  “First we need more budget integration, and then one day
it
will be eurobonds,” Reynders told reporters in Wroclaw, Poland,
today before a meeting of euro-area finance ministers on
Europe’s debt crisis.  Reynders dismissed the possibility of a country defaulting
or departing the euro zone. “Europe is built on crises, but it
doesn’t go backward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
