National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  won’t
need to turn to the country’s Financial Stability Fund,  Imerisia 
said, citing management comments to bank officials in northern
 Greece .  The bank has examined all possible options as a result of a
continuing audit by  BlackRock Inc (BLK)  of the loan portfolios of
Greek lenders, and has taken necessary actions to avoid using
the Fund, the Athens-based newspaper reported.  No further merger deals in the Greek banking sector will
take place until after the audit is completed toward the end of
the year, Imerisia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
