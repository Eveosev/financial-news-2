(Corrects headline and first two paragraphs to specify
economic outlook is through the end of 2012.)  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the
package-delivery company whose shipments make it an economic
bellwether, said U.S. stagnation may persist through 2012.  UPS expects “subpar growth” in the world’s largest
economy until the end of next year, Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said today at an investor conference in Louisville,
Kentucky. While no improvement is in sight now, the economy is
“not getting worse,” he said.  Goods moved on UPS trucks and planes range from financial
documents to pharmaceuticals. Average daily U.S. package volume
was little changed in the second quarter, inching up 0.1
percent, and Atlanta-based UPS said in July that the U.S.
economy would be “sluggish” this quarter.  “There’s risk for a double-dip recession, but I’d say it’s
unlikely,” Chief Executive Officer Scott Davis said later at a
briefing for reporters. “The odds are higher than they were six
months ago, but I don’t expect it.”  UPS reiterated today that adjusted 2011 earnings would be
in a range of $4.15 to $4.40 a share, while forecasting profit
on that basis of $6.90 to $8.60 by 2016 as the  U.S. economy 
strengthens.  Revenue by 2016 will be $72 billion to $79 billion,
according to UPS, the world’s largest package-delivery company.
That would be an improvement from 2010’s $49.5 billion. UPS said
its forecast assumes annual expansion in U.S. gross domestic
product of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent from 2013 to 2016.  ‘More Normal’  “Hopefully, a lot of things have bottomed out, real estate
being one,” Kuehn said at the briefing. “We see a slowly
rising economy in 2012 and hopefully back up to more normal
trend growth starting in 2013.”  UPS also said it plans to spend about $200 million to
expand its hub in Cologne,  Germany , increasing hourly sorting
capacity by about 70 percent to 190,000 packages by the end of
2013. The project will add as many as 200 jobs by that year and
will be the company’s largest facility investment outside the
U.S., UPS said.  Share repurchases will total at least $8 billion from 2012
to 2014, UPS said. The company also boosted planned buybacks for
2011 by 35 percent to $2.7 billion.  UPS rose 2 cents to $66.18 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 8.8 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
