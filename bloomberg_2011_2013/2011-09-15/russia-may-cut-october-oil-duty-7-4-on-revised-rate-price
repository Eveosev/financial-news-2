Russia  may reduce its export duty
on most crude shipments by 7.4 percent on Oct. 1, after Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  urged a tax measure to spur production
and oil prices fell.  The standard duty may decline to $411.40 a metric ton
($56.12 a barrel), according to Bloomberg calculations based on
 Finance Ministry  data, using a tax rate of 60 percent, down from
the 65 percent applied previously. The duty for September was
set at $444.10 a ton.  The discounted rate on some Eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea oil may be reduce to $204.50 from $205.10 this month.  Russia bases its export duties on the average Urals price
from the 15th day of one month to the 14th day of the next.
Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $112.26 during
the most recent monitoring period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said by phone today.  Putin must sign off on the levies for them to come into
effect. The Finance Ministry is calculating the duties for
October based on the so-called 60-66 formula, Sakovich said. The
government will probably set the 60 percent rate “by hand”
each month, he said in August. Putin last month signed an order
unifying the refined product duty at 66 percent of the crude
levy.  The product duty may be set at $271.50 a ton next month.
That would cut the tax on middle distillates such as diesel by
8.7 percent, while raising the rate for heavy products like  fuel
oil  by 31 percent.  A special gasoline tax that Putin imposed starting May 1 to
fight domestic shortages may fall to $370.20 a ton, Sakovich
said. That is 90 percent of the crude duty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
