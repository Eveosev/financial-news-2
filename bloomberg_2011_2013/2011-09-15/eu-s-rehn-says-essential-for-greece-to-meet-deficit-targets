European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said it is “essential”
for  Greece  to meet its budget-deficit targets.  “The essential thing is that Greece will have to meet the
fiscal targets and fill the implementation gaps in structural
reforms in order to enhance growth and competitiveness of the
Greek economy, and thus also convince its partners that they
will continue to support Greece through the conditional loan
package, which will be discussed tomorrow in the eurogroup,”
Rehn told reporters today in Brussels.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
