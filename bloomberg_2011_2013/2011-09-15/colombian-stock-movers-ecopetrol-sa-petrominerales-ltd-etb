The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index gained 1 percent to 13,684.26, while the
Colcap Index gained 1.1 percent to 1,659.03.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  ,  Colombia ’s largest  oil company ,
rose 2.8 percent to 4,010 pesos, the highest in three months.
The state-controlled company has enough cash on hand and there
are no plans to sell bonds, Chief Executive Officer  Javier Gutierrez  said yesterday.  Investors may be buying shares before the company’s
dividend payments, said Camilo Rubiano, an analyst at brokerage
Afin SA.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota (ETB)  SA, the
phone company serving Colombia’s capital, rose 5.4 percent to
641 pesos, a two-month high. Investors may be betting a new
Bogota mayor that voters will pick in an Oct. 30 election would
be in favor of selling the city’s majority stake in the company,
said Rubiano.  Former Bogota mayor Enrique Penalosa, who sought to sell
the city’s stake during his last term, led with 22 percent of
intended votes in a poll by the Central Nacional de Consultoria
SA, according to the daily El Tiempo. The poll, with a 3.09
percent margin of error, surveyed 1,000 Bogota residents between
Aug. 30 and Sept. 1, the daily said.  Petrominerales Ltd. (PMG)  , a Calgary-based oil company
with production and exploration in Colombia, rose 2.1 percent to
57,060 pesos. The company said yesterday it resumed production
at its Corcel and Guatiquia fields in the South American
country.  Petrominerales said Sept. 12 that production totaling over
30,000 barrels of oil per day had been shut in on blockades by
protesters. The company said yesterday in a Marketwire statement
that it expects full capacity to be restored within 48 to 72
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
