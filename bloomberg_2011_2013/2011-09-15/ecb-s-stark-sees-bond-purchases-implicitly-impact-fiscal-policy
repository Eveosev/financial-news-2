European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said that the purchase of  government
bonds  by the ECB implicitly impacts fiscal policy.  The “crucial question” regarding bond purchases “is the
motivation,” Stark said in Vienna today. “The governing
council justifies them from a monetary policy perspective,
because the transmission mechanism is in danger, doesn’t
function. But we are also implicitly in the region of quasi
fiscal policy. And that is something we have to monitor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
