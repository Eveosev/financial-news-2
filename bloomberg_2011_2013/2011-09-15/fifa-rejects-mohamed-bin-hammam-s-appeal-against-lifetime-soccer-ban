FIFA’s Appeal Committee rejected
Mohamed bin Hammam’s appeal against a lifetime ban from soccer,
the ruling body said in a statement.  Bin Hammam, who was head of the Asian confederation, was
banned in July after being found guilty of buying votes for the
FIFA leadership contest against Sepp Blatter. Bin Hammam said
the ban was politically motivated.  His lawyers said in a statement today that he’ll now take
the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the top sports
tribunal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
