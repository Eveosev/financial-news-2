The euro may win the “ugly
contest” and drop against the dollar, as  Europe ’s debt crisis
makes the region more likely to fall into an economic recession
than the U.S., according to Westpac Banking Corp.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the euro dropped this week to
the lowest since February as the yield premium of two-year
European bonds over U.S. counterparts narrowed to the least in
eight months. Also tracked is a Credit Suisse Group AG index of
traders’ bets on how much the  European Central Bank  will change
its benchmark  interest rate  over the next 12 months. The gauge
last week showed expectations for the biggest cut in 2 1/2
years, at 34 basis points, or 0.34 percentage point.  “From a relative growth perspective, the U.S. will have
more momentum than Europe,” said Westpac’s  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
Singapore-based currency strategist. “It is an ugly contest and
the  U.S. dollar  was winning it for much of this year, but the
momentum has definitely swung back in euro’s favor.”  The last time traders predicted bigger rate cuts than 34
basis points was in March 2009, amid a global recession, when
the euro weakened to $1.2481 and the spread between European and
U.S. two-year bond yields was at 29 basis points. The euro
dropped to $1.3495 on Sept. 12, a seven-month low. The spread
between two-year European and Treasury yields reached 22 basis
points on Sept. 9, the least since Jan. 5.  The ECB cut its 2011 growth forecast to 1.6 percent from
1.9 percent, and for 2012 to 1.3 percent from 1.7 percent at
this month’s meeting. Policy makers left the main refinancing
rate unchanged at 1.5 percent, having already raised it twice by
0.25 percentage point this year.  The so-called shadow ECB council, a group of 15 economists
and portfolio managers who watch developments and policy in the
region and issue recommendations, has said the central bank
should reverse direction and cut borrowing costs to prevent the
euro-area economy from slipping back into recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
