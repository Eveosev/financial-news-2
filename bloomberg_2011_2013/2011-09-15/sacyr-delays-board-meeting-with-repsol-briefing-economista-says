Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , the largest
shareholder in Spanish oil company  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , delayed the
board meeting it planned to hold today in its Madrid
headquarters, El Economista said, citing unidentified people.  At the meeting, which was postponed to Sept. 30, Sacyr
directors will be briefed on contacts it has made with other
core shareholders of Repsol, and of possible legal complications
that emerged regarding Sacyr´s agreement with Repsol stockholder
 Petroleos Mexicanos , the report said.  The reason for the delay wasn´t given. The shareholder
pact, signed Aug. 29, calls on Sacyr and Petroleos Mexicanos, or
Pemex, to jointly vote a combined 29.8 percent of Repsol shares
and attempt to revamp the oil company’s management.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
