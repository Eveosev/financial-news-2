Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded the Mexican municipality of Durango to Ba3 from Ba2,
citing an increase in borrowing fueled in part by the cost of
fighting drug cartels. Moody’s also revised the outlook to
negative from stable.  Net direct and indirect debt climbed to 34.9 percent of
operating revenue in 2010 from 16.9 percent in 2006 as Durango
hired more police officers, raised their salaries and held
municipal elections last year, Moody’s said in an e-mailed
statement.  While  gang violence  wasn’t the only driver, security
concerns pressured government finances at a time when Durango
was also spending more to hold elections, change administrations
and update computer technology, according to Moody’s analyst
Maria del Carmen Martinez-Richa.  “They hired more and more police because of the security
situation,” Martinez-Richa said in a telephone interview from
Mexico City. “That’s put a bit of pressure on operating
costs.”  Nationwide, at least 35,000 deaths have been attributed to
drug violence since President Felipe Calderon took office in
December 2006.  Net direct and indirect debt may climb to 40 percent of
operating revenue this year, according to Moody’s calculations
based on planned borrowing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
