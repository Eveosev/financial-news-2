Six banks, including Morgan
Stanley, have been invited to bid for about 320 million dirhams
($87 million) of Nakheel PJSC’s trade-creditor bonds next week,
two bankers familiar with the matter said.  The auction will be held on Sept. 20 and the settlement is
expected on Sept. 28, said the bankers, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  Nakheel, the builder of man-made islands of Dubai’s coast,
said Aug. 24 it would issue 3.8 billion dirhams of Islamic bonds
to its contractors and suppliers as the last step in
restructuring $16.1 billion of liabilities. The company plans to
issue an additional 1 billion dirhams of the bond as part of the
8.5 billion-dirham program that it has set up.  The bonds, known as sukuk, pay a profit rate of 10 percent
and are being used to pay 60 percent of what’s owed to
contractors and suppliers. The remaining 40 percent is being
paid in cash.  To contact the reporters on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
