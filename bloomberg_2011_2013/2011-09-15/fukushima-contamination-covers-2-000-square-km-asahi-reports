About 2,000 square kilometers (772
square miles) of land surrounding  Japan â€™s wrecked Fukushima
nuclear power plant needs to be decontaminated, the  Asahi
newspaper  reported.  The area is about one-seventh of Fukushima prefecture in
northern Japan, where the damaged plant is located, the Asahi
said, citing an assessment by Yuichi Moriguchi, a professor of
environmental systems engineering at Tokyo University.  About 100 million cubic meters (131 million cubic yards) of
topsoil, enough to fill 80 Tokyo Dome baseball stadiums, needs
to be removed, the Asahi said, citing the assessment.  Radiation has been spewing from the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant since March 11 when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out
cooling, causing three reactors to meltdown and forcing 160,000
people to flee their homes.
