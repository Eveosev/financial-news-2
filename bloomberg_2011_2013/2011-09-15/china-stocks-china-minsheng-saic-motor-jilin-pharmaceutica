Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 3 p.m. close.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, dropped 5.77 points, or 0.2 percent, to
2,479.05. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  fell 0.2 percent to 2,729.05.  Banks: China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016 CH) lost 1.7
percent to 5.77 yuan. Bank of Beijing Co. (601169 CH) declined
1.3 percent to 9.60 yuan.  Smaller banks set aside more cash as reserves today
following the broadening of the reserve-requirement ratio base
to include margin deposits, also supporting the rate. The move
may lock up a total of 83 billion yuan ($13 billion) of capital,
according to Qilu Bank Co. in Jinan.  Jilin Pharmaceutical Co. (000545 CH) fell 5 percent, the
daily limit for so-called special-treatment stocks, to 10.70
yuan, after the stock resumed trading following a two-month
suspension. The company said it wasn’t able to initiate a
“major asset reorganization” within the required period of
time and will give up efforts related to the reorganization for
at least three months.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104 CH), China’s biggest carmaker by
market value, advanced 2.3 percent to 15.47 yuan. The carmaker
will issue 1.78 billion shares to its parent for 29.12 billion
yuan of assets, according to a statement to the  Shanghai Stock
Exchange . Investors should buy Chinese auto stocks because their
valuations are at record lows and auto sales have likely
bottomed out, according to Citic Securities Co., the nation’s
biggest listed brokerage.  Shenzhen O-film Tech Co. (002456 CH) jumped by the 10
percent daily limit to 19.53 yuan. The company will expand
investment in a unit making electronics parts to 1 billion yuan
from 350 million yuan, according to a statement to the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
