The ruble climbed the most in a
week against the dollar after the  European Central Bank  said it
will lend to euro-area banks, spurring optimism the debt crisis
will be contained and stoking appetite for riskier assets.  Russia ’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 30.3975 by the
7 p.m. close in Moscow, reversing an earlier drop of as much as
0.4 percent and rebounding from its weakest level in eight
months. The ruble was down 1 percent at 42.1000 versus the euro.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said that, in coordination with the
 Federal Reserve  and other regulators it will conduct U.S. dollar
liquidity-providing operations to ensure banks have enough of
the U.S. currency through the end of the year.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, rose as much as 1.4
percent to $90.02 a barrel in electronic trading in  New York ,
reversing an earlier slide to $88.01 a barrel. Brent oil climbed
2.4 percent to $115.06 a barrel in London  The ruble’s moves against the dollar and the euro pushed
the currency down 0.3 percent to 35.6144, the weakest since
December based on closing prices, against the central bank’s
target currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters. The basket is calculated by multiplying the
dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by
0.45, then adding them together.  Investors pared bets the ruble will weaken further with
non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.7753 per
dollar in three months. The contracts provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements and interest-rate
differentials and allow companies to hedge against currency
swings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
