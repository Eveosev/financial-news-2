Charter Hall Office REIT (CQO)  has
refinanced its A$365 million Australian commercial mortgage
backed security facility, which matured today. The CMBS Notes
were refinanced with the recently secured A$290 million ‘back
stop facility,’ and from proceeds retained from prior CMBS asset
sales and working capital. The new facility, which is being
provided by Australian banks, has a term of up to three years,
according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
