European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said there will be “consequences”
if  Greece  does not carry out all the economic-adjustment
conditions of its European Union and International Monetary Fund
bailout program.   “There is no other option other than to complete the
program,” Stark said in an interview with Austrian state
broadcaster ORF today. “The working assumption is fulfillment
of the program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
