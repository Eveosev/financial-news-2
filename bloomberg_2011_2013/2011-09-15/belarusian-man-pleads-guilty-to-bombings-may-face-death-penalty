A 25-year-old man pleaded guilty to
organizing bombings in the Belarusian capital Minsk in 2008 and
2011, raising the possibility the former Soviet republic’s
first-ever terrorism trial will result in execution.  Dmitry Konovalov, 25, submitted his plea today at the
 Supreme Court  of Belarus in Minsk. Another defendant, Vladislav
Kovalev, also 25, denied charges of conspiring with Konovalov.  Konovalov is charged with killing 15 people and wounding
more than 160 with a homemade bomb planted under a bench in
Minsk’s busiest metro station on April 11. He is also accused of
organizing other bombings, including an Independence Day blast
that injured more than 50 people in 2008. Kovalev is charged
with conspiracy and illegally buying explosives.  The bombers acted on their own, without instruction from an
outside party, prosecutors say.  To contact the reporter on this story:
