Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO) , known as OTE, extended by a week discussions
with labor unions on measures to cut payroll costs,  Imerisia 
reported, without citing anyone.  OTE wants the unions to propose measures that will lead to
savings of 300 million euros ($412.1 million) over the next
three years, the Athens-based newspaper said. Failure to agree
such measures will see the company proceed with its own
proposals such as reducing the working week to four days or
cutting the daily work time by two hours with a corresponding
cut to wages, Imerisia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
