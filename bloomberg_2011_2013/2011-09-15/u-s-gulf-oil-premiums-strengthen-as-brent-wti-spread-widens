U.S. Gulf crude premiums surged
after U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate’s discount to Brent
widened for a second day.  The gap between WTI and Brent October contracts increased
$1.77 to $25.26 a barrel at 12:14 p.m. in  New York . The spread
settled Sept. 7 at a record margin of $26.46.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased $2.80 to $27.50
over WTI at 12:04 p.m. in New York as Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s
premium widened $3 a barrel to $30.50, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the
premium for Mars Blend added $3 to $25 while Poseidon
strengthened $3 to $25 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium added $2.75 to $23.25 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to 60 cents
below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium increased $3.25 to $27.75
above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude added 75 cents to $12 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $1 to
$12.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
