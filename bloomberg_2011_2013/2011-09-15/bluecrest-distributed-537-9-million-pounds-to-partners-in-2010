BlueCrest Capital Management LLP,
the $27 billion hedge fund founded by Michael Platt, distributed
537.9 million pounds ($851.1 million) of profits to its partners
last year, according to a U.K. Companies House filing.  BlueCrest made the earnings during a 13-month period ending
in December 2010, according to the filing. The hedge fund earned
448.7 million pounds in the period from Aug. 11, 2008, through
November 2009, the filing said.  The six partners named in the filing include Platt, 43,
three BlueCrest units and company executives. The firm’s  hedge
funds  include the BlueTrend Fund, a computer-driven trading
strategy that gained 16 percent in 2010, and the BlueCrest
Capital International Fund, which rose about 12 percent last
year. Management and performance fees from BlueCrest’s hedge
funds totaled 874.3 million pounds last year, according to the
filing.  Platt moved to Geneva last year after European Union policy
makers moved to toughen rules for hedge funds and the U.K.
imposed higher taxes on its wealthiest citizens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
