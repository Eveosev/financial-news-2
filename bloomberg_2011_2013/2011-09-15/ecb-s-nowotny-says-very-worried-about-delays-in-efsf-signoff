European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny is very concerned about delays in
the approval of the revised Greece rescue program and said
politicians’ agendas were “weakening”  Europe ’s crisis
reaction.  “Frankly, I’m deeply worried about those developments,”
Nowotny said in an interview with Austrian state radio ORF
broadcast today, asked about possible delays for approval of an
overhaul of the European Financial Stability Facility in  Germany 
and other countries. “I fear that the actors aren’t aware which
risks they create for the overall economy but also for their own
countries.”  Nowotny added that Europe was “weakened” by a “multitude
of opinions” among policy makers. “Many nations and many
politicians are mainly concerned with domestic politics, and
that’s certainly a structural problem of Europe,” he added.  The ECB would have to reconsider its program to buy euro-
area government bonds if the upgraded EFSF isn’t approved in
time, said Nowotny, who also heads the Austrian central bank.  “The ECB regards its measures as temporary and it is
expecting that this rescue program will step in,” he said. “If
there is no working rescue program” it would have to “rethink
everything,” he added. “This is a very sensitive situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
