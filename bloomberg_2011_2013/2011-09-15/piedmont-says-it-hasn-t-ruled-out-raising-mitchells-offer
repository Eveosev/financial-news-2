Piedmont Inc., the investment
vehicle of Bahamas-based billionaire  Joe Lewis , said it hasn’t
ruled out increasing its offer price over 230 pence per share
for  Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB) , the U.K. owner of the All Bar One
pub chain.  “Piedmont reserves the right to increase its offer price
above 230 pence per Mitchells & Butlers share, were an offer to
be made,” the company said in a regulatory statement today.
“Piedmont wishes to clarify that it has not stated that it will
not increase its offer price over 230 pence.”  Piedmont, which owns 22.8 percent of Birmingham,  England 
based Mitchells & Butlers, said Sept. 12 it was considering an
offer to buy the rest of the pub chain at 230 pence per share.
Mitchells & Butlers, which closed at 260 pence per share in
London trading yesterday, said it would reject such an offer
because it “significantly” undervalues the company.  “It’s a derisory offer,” Nigel Parson, an analyst at
Evolution Securities who has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, said
in a phone interview. “Piedmont would have to pay in excess of
300 pence per share to value the business properly.”  Piedmont’s possible offer is “insulting,” David Cumming,
head of U.K. equities at Standard Life said Sept. 13. “The
business is worth substantially more than the terms proposed.”
Standard Life holds 0.34 percent in Mitchells & Butlers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
