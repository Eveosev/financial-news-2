Reducing the euro area to a smaller
group of northern countries would be “a fiasco” for  Germany ’s
export-dependent economy, said Michael Meister, the finance

of getting  Greece  out of the euro area is “somewhat reckless,”
Meister told reporters in Berlin today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
