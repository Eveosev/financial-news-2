Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan
today introduced legislation allowing financial companies to
sell covered bonds at home, a move the nation’s Treasury
estimates may lead to A$130 billion ($133 billion) of sales.  The law will amend the nation’s  Banking Act  to allow
domestic lenders to sell the debt for the first time.  While offshore banks have been allowed to sell covered
notes in  Australia , the ban meant domestic lenders were unable
to access cheaper funding in a nation with the highest  interest
rates  in the developed world. Covered bonds, which typically
have the highest  credit rating , are backed by assets that stay
on the bank’s balance sheet and can be sold in a default.  “This is a critical economic reform to strengthen and
diversify the Australian financial system’s access to cheaper,
more stable and longer-term funding,” Swan said in an e-mailed
copy of a speech to parliament introducing the legislation.
“Allowing our institutions another string in their bow -- to
compete for funding with banks around the world -- is an
absolute no-brainer.”  The government’s legislation will allow smaller lenders to
pool together and jointly issue covered bonds, and ensures the
“absolute security” of depositors’ savings, Swan said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
