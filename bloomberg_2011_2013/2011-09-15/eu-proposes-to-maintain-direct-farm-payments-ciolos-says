The European Commission, the
regulatory arm of the European Union, will propose that so-
called direct payments to farmers be maintained as part of the
blocâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy to provide basic financial
security, EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said.  The commission will propose that 30 percent of those direct
payments be made available to reward environmentally sustainable
practices in agriculture, Ciolos said in an e-mailed copy of a
speech in Joensuu,  Finland , today.  Forty-five percent of European soils are under stress, with
low levels of organic matter, and almost a quarter suffer from
erosion, Ciolos said.  Climate change  is not a long-term danger
and is already happening, as shown by more and more extreme
weather events, the commissioner said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
