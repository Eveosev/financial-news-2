Libyan rebel forces launched an
offensive to take Sirte, the hometown of Muammar Qaddafi that
has resisted a peaceful handover over the past few weeks.  Nine hundred armed pickup trucks, the largest mobile force
so far assembled for a single operation, attacked Sirte “to
free the city and raise the banner of independence above it,”
the Misrata Military Council said in a statement today. The
council’s troops were also fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces 30
miles (50 kilometers) west of Sirte, it said.  Qaddafi supporters inside Sirte were preventing civilians
from leaving, according to the statement. Supplies of food,
water and medicines were being moved toward Sirte to deliver to
the civilian population, it said.  Pro-Qaddafi forces continue to control Sirte, as well as
Beni Walid, 90 miles south of Tripoli, almost four weeks after
the Libyan rebel fighters entered Tripoli and the southern towns
of Hun and Sabha. The whereabouts of Qaddafi remain unknown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
