Indonesia  will likely sell its
global sukuk after this month,  Rahmat Waluyanto , director
general at the finance ministry’s debt management office, said
in Jakarta today.  The government doesn’t have urgent funding needs and is
looking for the right timing for the sale because of current
global market conditions, Waluyanto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
