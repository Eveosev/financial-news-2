The economic slowdown in the
European Union and global economy is having a “direct impact”
on the outlook for  Poland ’s gross domestic product,
EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.   “Poland is a very open economy and it is very dependent on
global growth as well as European economic growth,” Rehn told
reporters in Brussels today as he presented the EU’s latest
economic forecasts. “Therefore the deterioration of the outlook
in the world and in Europe has had a very direct impact on the
growth prospects of the Polish economy, because obviously this
leads to lower growth in Polish exports.”  The EU cut its forecast for Poland’s GDP growth in the
third quarter to 0.6 percent from the 1.1 percent projected in
March, and lowered its fourth-quarter outlook to 0.5 percent
from 1.0 percent. At the same time, the EU reduced its forecast
for euro-area expansion to 0.2 percent in the third quarter and
0.1 percent in the fourth, compared with earlier estimates for
growth for 0.4 percent in both periods.  “The downward revision of real GDP growth prospects in
Poland in the second half of the year results from the
deterioration in the global economic situation and lower real
GDP growth in  Europe  from the second quarter,” Rehn said.  The EU maintained its full-year forecast for Poland,
projecting 4 percent GDP growth for all of 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
