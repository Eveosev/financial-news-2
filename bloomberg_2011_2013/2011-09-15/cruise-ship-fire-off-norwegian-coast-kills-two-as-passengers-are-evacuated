Two people were killed after a fire
broke out on a cruise ship owned by Hurtigruten Group ASA,
outside Aalesund, on  Norway ’s western coast,  Moere and Romsdal 
health authorities said.  Nine people have been hospitalized, two with serious
injuries, Arnt Sommerlund, spokesman for the region’s health
authorities said by phone.  “I can confirm that two people have died on the boat,”
Sommerlund said. The hospitalized passengers are being treated
for fire and smoke related injuries, he said.  All passengers and crew of MS Nordlys had been evacuated
from the ship after the fire started in the engine room, the
Narvik-based company  said  earlier. There were 207 passengers and
55 crew members on board, according to Hurtigruten.  The company’s shares dropped 1.8 percent to 3.33 kroner at
1:19 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
