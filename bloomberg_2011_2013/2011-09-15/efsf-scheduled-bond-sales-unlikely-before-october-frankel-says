The European Financial Stability
Facility’s scheduled second-half bond sales probably won’t occur
before the first week of October, Christophe Frankel, its chief
financial officer, told reporters in  Singapore  today. Frankel
said he’s “confident” the bond sales will be successful and
that  Asia  will be a “very active” investor.  Further decisions are needed to see if the EFSF will be
involved in the second bailout of  Greece , he also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
