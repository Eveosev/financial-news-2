The following is the text of
the U.S. international transactions report from the
Commerce Department.  The U.S. current-account deficit the combined balances on
trade in goods and services, income, and net unilateral
current transfers decreased to $118.0 billion
(preliminary) in the second quarter of 2011, from $119.6
billion (revised) in the first quarter.  The decrease was
more than accounted for by increases in the surplus on
income and the surplus on services.  Increases in the
deficit on goods and in net unilateral current transfers
were partly offsetting.  Goods and services  The deficit on goods and services increased to
$145.0 billion in the second quarter from $140.0 billion
in the first.  Goods  The deficit on goods increased to $190.4 billion in
the second quarter from $182.2 billion in the first.  Goods exports increased to $373.1 billion from
$361.5 billion.  All major end-use categories increased;
industrial supplies and materials and capital goods
accounted for most of the increase. The increase in
industrial supplies and materials mostly reflected growth
in petroleum and products and in chemicals. Capital goods
increased largely as a result of gains in machinery and
equipment. (See Table 2a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=20&area_id=3) for the latest available
statistics.)  Goods imports increased to $563.5 billion from
$543.8 billion.  Most major end-use categories increased;
nearly three-fourths of the increase was accounted for by
increases in industrial supplies and materials, mostly as
a result of growth in petroleum and products and in iron
and steel products. Capital goods rose as a result of
growth in computers, peripherals, and parts. A decrease in
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines, primarily due to
a drop in passenger cars, was partly offsetting. (See
Table 2a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=20&area_id=3) for the latest available
statistics.)  Services  The surplus on services increased to $45.4 billion
in the second quarter from $42.3 billion in the first.  Services receipts increased to $150.7 billion from
$146.0 billion.  The largest increases were in travel and
in other private services.  Most of the other services
categories also increased.  Services payments increased to $105.2 billion from
$103.8 billion.  The largest increases were in travel, in
other transportation, and in other private services.  Income  The surplus on income increased to $61.1 billion in
the second quarter from $52.7 billion in the first.  Investment income  Income receipts on U.S.-owned assets abroad
increased to $191.6 billion from $178.9 billion.  The
increase was mostly accounted for by increases in direct
investment receipts and in other private receipts (which
consists of interest and dividends).  Income payments on foreign-owned assets in the
 United States  increased to $128.2 billion from $124.0
billion.  Most of the increase was accounted for by an
increase in direct investment payments.  Compensation of employees  Receipts for compensation of U.S. workers abroad
remained at $1.4 billion.  Payments for compensation of
foreign workers in the United States remained at $3.6
billion.  Unilateral current transfers  Net unilateral current transfers to foreigners were
$34.2 billion in the second quarter, up from $32.3 billion
in the first.  The increase was more than accounted for by
an increase in U.S. government grants.  Capital Account  Net capital account payments were $0.8 billion in
the second quarter, up from near zero over the previous
two quarters.  Financial Account  Net financial inflows were $25.7 billion in the
second quarter, down from $156.1 billion in the first.
The slowdown resulted from a steep reduction in the growth
of foreign-owned assets in the United States that more
than offset a reversal from an increase to a decrease in
U.S.-owned assets abroad.  U.S.-owned assets abroad  U.S.-owned assets abroad decreased $22.9 billion
in the second quarter, following an increase of $334.4
billion in the first.  U.S. claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks
and securities brokers decreased $195.7 billion in the
second quarter, following an increase of $87.8 billion in
the first.  (Examples of these claims are U.S.
banksüEdeposits at foreign banks and U.S. banksüEloans to
foreigners.) Most of the decrease resulted from a
substantial decrease in claims for own accounts,
particularly in deposits abroad. (See Table 10a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=13) for the latest available statistics.)  Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities were
$30.1 billion in the second quarter, following net
purchases of $58.2 billion in the first.  Net purchases of
foreign stocks slowed to $26.7 billion from $47.1 billion.
Net purchases of foreign bonds were $3.4 billion, down
from $11.0 billion. (See Table 8a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=17) for the latest available statistics.)  U.S. direct investment abroad was $134.1 billion
in the second quarter, up from $89.2 billion in the first.
The increase resulted in large part from increases in
equity investment, along with smaller increases in
intercompany debt investment and reinvested earnings. (See
Table 7a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=9 
0730&table_id=18&area_id=3) for the latest available
statistics.)  U.S. claims on unaffiliated foreigners reported by
U.S. nonbanking concerns increased $0.9 billion in the
second quarter, following an increase of $95.0 billion in
the first.  U.S. official reserve assets increased $6.3
billion in the second quarter, following an increase of
$3.6 billion in the first.  The increase was mostly a
result of an increase in the reserve position in the
 International Monetary Fund .  U.S. government assets other than official reserve
assets increased $1.4 billion in the second quarter,
following an increase of $0.5 billion in the first.  Foreign-owned assets in the United States  Foreign-owned assets in the United States
increased $2.8 billion in the second quarter, following an
increase of $487.2 billion in the first.  U.S. liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S.
banks and securities brokers (other than foreign official
assets) decreased $101.0 billion in the second quarter,
following an increase of $354.4 billion in the first.
(Examples of these liabilities are deposits of foreign
residents at banks in the United States and loans by banks
abroad to banks in the United States.)  All of the
decrease resulted from a decline in liabilities for own
accounts, particularly in loan positions from foreigners.
(See Table 11a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=14) for the latest available statistics.)  Net private foreign sales of U.S. Treasury
securities were $63.8 billion in the second quarter, a
shift from net purchases of $3.5 billion in the first.  Net private foreign sales of U.S. securities other
than U.S. Treasury securities were $9.5 billion in the
second quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the first.  Net
foreign sales of U.S. federally sponsored agency bonds
were $23.3 billion in the second quarter, down from $32.5
billion in the first.  Net foreign sales of U.S. corporate
bonds were $13.9 billion, up from $4.3 billion. Net
foreign purchases of U.S. stocks decreased to $27.7
billion from $34.2 billion. (See Table 8a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=17) for the latest available statistics.)  Foreign direct investment in the United States was
$47.7 billion in the second quarter, following investment
of $28.5 billion in the first.  Nearly all of the increase
resulted from increases in equity investment. (See Table
7a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=18&area_id=3) for the latest available
statistics.)  U.S. liabilities to unaffiliated foreigners
reported by U.S. nonbanking concerns increased $20.8
billion in the second quarter, following an increase of
$42.0 billion in the first.  Foreign official assets in the United States
increased $94.6 billion in the second quarter, following
an increase of $48.8 billion in the first.  The increase
was mostly due to net purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities.  Net shipments of U.S. currency to foreign
countries were $14.0 billion in the second quarter, up
from $12.6 billion in the first.  The statistical discrepancy net errors and
omissions in recorded transactions as $93.1 billion in the
second quarter compared with -$36.4 billion in the first.  In the second quarter, the  U.S. dollar  depreciated
1.7 percent on a trade-weighted quarterly average basis
against a group of 7 major currencies. (Data are based on
Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.10.)  Revisions  The first-quarter 2011 international transactions
