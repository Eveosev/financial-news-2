Commissioner Douglas Shulman said the U.S. is in talks with the
Swiss government on issues related to  tax evasion  by U.S.
citizens.  In a conference call with reporters today to discuss
international tax enforcement, he declined to provide details on
those discussions.  “I think a lot of Swiss banks aren’t taking these kinds of
accounts anymore and they’re really trying hard to move
forward,” Shulman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
