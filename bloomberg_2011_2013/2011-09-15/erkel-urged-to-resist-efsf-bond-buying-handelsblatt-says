German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  was
urged by  Wolfgang Franz , the head of her council of economic
advisers, to oppose secondary-market bond purchases by  Europe ’s
overhauled rescue fund, Handelsblatt  reported , citing an
interview with Franz.  Joint debt issuance by euro-area countries, known as euro
bonds, is illegal after a ruling this month by  Germany ’s Federal
Constitutional Court, Franz was quoted as saying in the
interview published in the German newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
