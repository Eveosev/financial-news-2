The following is the text
of  Canada 's new motor vehicles sales report for July
released by  Statistics Canada .  The number of new motor vehicles sold fell 6.2% in July
to 132,386 units, partially offsetting the gains in June.
Truck and passenger car sales both declined. Lower sales
in Ontario accounted for half of the national decrease.  Preliminary industry data indicate that the number of
new motor vehicles sold in August decreased 1%.  Sales fall for both trucks and passenger cars  Sales of trucks (which include minivans, sport-utility
vehicles, light and heavy trucks, vans and buses) fell
5.9% to 76,360 units in July, a third decline in four
months.  Passenger car sales in July decreased 6.7% to 56,026
units. North American-built passenger cars (-10.3%)
accounted for most of the decline, which partially offset
the 20.0% increase registered in June. Sales of overseas-
built passenger cars edged down 0.2%, continuing a
downward trend which began in early 2010.  Sales down in most provinces  New motor vehicle sales decreased in nine provinces in
July.  The largest decrease in units sold was in Ontario,
where sales fell 8.3%, partially offsetting the increase
in June.  Sales in Alberta decreased 7.9% in July. Sales of new
motor vehicles have been on an upward trend since the
beginning of 2011.  New motor vehicle sales in  Quebec  fell 4.1%,
contributing to a downward trend in sales that began in
late 2010.  Nova Scotia (+1.1%) was the sole province to report a
rise in sales, a second consecutive monthly increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
