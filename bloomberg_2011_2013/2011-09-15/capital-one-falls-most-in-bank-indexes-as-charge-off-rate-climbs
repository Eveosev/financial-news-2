Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
McLean, Virginia-based company that gets more than half its
revenue from credit cards, declined the most among the largest
U.S. banks after saying card charge-offs climbed in August.  Capital One’s U.S. credit-card annual net charge-off rate
rose to 4.10 percent from 3.77 percent in July, according to a
monthly filing. It was the first increase since November. Loans
30 days late or longer also climbed, for the third straight
month, to $1.85 billion, the company said.  Capital One declined $1.10, or 2.5 percent, to $42.42 at 12
p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, making
it the day’s worst performer in the 24-company KBW Bank Index
and the 81-firm Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index. The
shares had climbed 2.3 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
