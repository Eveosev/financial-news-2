Chinese companies are outdoing U.S.
competitors in partnering with Latin American firms as leaders
in the world’s fastest growing emerging economy seek to expand
their presence in the region, said Venezuelan billionaire
Gustavo Cisneros.  Cisneros, the chairman of Cisneros Group of Companies, said
China is making inroads into  Latin America ’s agricultural,
infrastructure and mining industries because its foreign policy
has emphasized economic cooperation and outreach to the region.
It’s more difficult to get U.S. companies “excited about
going” to Latin America, he said.  “China has a foreign policy which is directed toward
cooperation with business, and the government has directed that
toward investment in Latin America,” Cisneros said at the
Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit in  New York  tied to the magazine’s
ranking of the 50 most influential leaders in global markets,
finance, business and government. “In the  United States , the
private sector forgot about Latin America investment.”  Cisneros is setting up joint ventures with Chinese banks to
carry out investment in Latin American commodities industries.
 China  accounts for 9 percent of foreign direct investment in
Latin America, trailing only the U.S. and Holland, according to
the United Nations’ Economic Commission for Latin America and
the Caribbean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
