A $96.6 million loan backed by
 Manhattan ’s  Roosevelt Hotel , a high-end property near Grand
Central Terminal, was put on watch list by its master servicer
this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The master servicer is  Wells Fargo & Co . and the sponsor is
PIA Investments Ltd., the investment arm of Pakistan
International Airlines, Bloomberg data show. The loan matures on
Nov. 9 and was added to the watch list on Sept. 9, according to
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN) ’s Structured Credit Ratings business.  Revenue from the hotel’s 1,015 rooms dropped to $57.7
million in 2009 from $81 million the previous year because of
the slowdown in the economy and a decline in business travel
demand, Morningstar said in an e-mailed note. Net  cash flow 
decreased to $7.8 million in 2009 and 2010 from $30.1 million in
2008, according to Chicago-based Morningstar.  “We are concerned by the dramatic drop in reported net
cash flow,” Morningstar said in the note.  The property, built in 1924 and renovated in 1997, is
managed by  Interstate Hotels and Resorts Inc.   To contact the reporter on this story:
