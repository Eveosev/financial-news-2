The Netherlands is ready to sell
dollar-denominated bonds “if there is an opportunity” to
benefit from lower U.S. interest rates than those available in
the euro area, according to the Dutch State Treasury Agency.  Officials haven’t found an “adequate window” yet and it’s
difficult to say if a sale will take place this year as it
depends on market conditions, Peter Nijsse, the head of cash
management, issuance and trading at the DSTA, said in an
interview in  Singapore  today.  “It’s a combination of the basis swaps, which is now sort
of moving in our favor but also our euro level is getting
tighter and tighter,” Nijsse said. “So we are ready to do that
but we will only issue if it’s beneficial for us. I hope that it
will happen because we took a lot of effort into preparing
everything.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
