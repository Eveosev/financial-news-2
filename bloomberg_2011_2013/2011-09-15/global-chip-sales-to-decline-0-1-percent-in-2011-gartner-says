Semiconductor sales worldwide will
decline 0.1 percent this year to $299 billion, research company
 Gartner Inc. (IT)  said, reversing a previous forecast that revenue
would rise 5.1 percent.  Gartner also lowered its projection for chip sales in 2012,
predicting a 4.6 percent increase versus a 8.6 percent gain,
citing a worsening economic outlook.  “Three key factors are shaping the short-term outlook:
excess inventory, manufacturing overcapacity and slowing demand
due to economic weakness,” Bryan Lewis, research vice president
at  Stamford , Connecticut-based Gartner, said in a  statement 
today. “The odds of a double-dip U.S. recession continue to
rise and are raising fear that sales prospects will deteriorate
further.”  The research company said on Sept. 8 that global personal-
computer shipments will increase less than predicted this year
and next as consumers scale back spending. Semiconductor
companies’ third-quarter forecasts have been “well below
seasonal averages,” Lewis said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
