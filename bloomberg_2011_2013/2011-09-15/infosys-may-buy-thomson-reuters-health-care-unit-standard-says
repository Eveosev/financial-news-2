Infosys Ltd. is close to buying
 Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI) ’s health-care business for as much as $750
million in the Indian company’s biggest acquisition, the
Business Standard reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the negotiations.  Infosys is the frontrunner to buy the business and an
announcement may be made soon, the Indian newspaper reported.
 Thomson Reuters  is also seeking to sell its BARBRI bar-exam-
preparation business and the risk-management Enterprise Risk
unit, according to the report.  Infosys, India’s second-biggest software company, seeks to
add customers in industries outside of banking, its biggest
source of revenue. Thomson Reuters, based in New York, said in
June it plans to sell its health-care division.  Sarah Gideon, a spokeswoman at Infosys, declined to comment
on the report in an e-mail to Bloomberg News today. David
Wilkins, a spokesman at Thomson Reuters’ health-care unit in the
U.S., didn’t respond to an e-mail, a phone call to his office,
and a text message to his mobile-phone sent after office hours.  Thomson Reuters didn’t reply to a request for comment,
according to the Business Standard report. The company generated
$220 million of combined revenue from its health-care and
science operations in the quarter ended March 31, according to
the Indian newspaper.  Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
Thomson Reuters in providing financial news and information
products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
