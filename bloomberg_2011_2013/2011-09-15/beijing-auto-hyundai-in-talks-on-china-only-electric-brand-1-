Beijing Automobile Industry Holding
Co. and partner  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  are in talks to create a
China-only brand that will focus on electric cars, Xu Heyi,
chairman of the Chinese carmaker, said today.  The first electric vehicle under the brand may be
introduced by year’s end, Xu said in an interview in the Chinese
port city of Dalian, where he’s attending the World Economic
Forum meetings.  Daimler AG (DAI)  and Nissan Motor Co. have already announced
plans to add alternative-energy vehicles in China as the world’s
largest polluter seeks to reduce emissions. The government aims
to have 1 million electric-powered vehicles on the road by 2015,
according to the Ministry of Science.  Nissan will work with Wuhan-based Dongfeng Motor Group Co.
to roll out an EV under the new Venucia marque, the company said
July 26. Daimler and Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. aim to
introduce an electric car in  China  in 2013, Ulrich Walker, the
Stuttgart, Germany-based company’s chairman and chief executive
officer for Northeast  Asia , said in April.  Separately, Xu said that Beijing Auto’s passenger-car
venture with Daimler is seeking 12.8 billion yuan ($2 billion)
in loans from a group of banks for new production lines and an
engine factory.  The Chinese automaker also plans to list unit  BAIC Motor Co. 
next year, he said.  --Liza Lin, Zheng Lifei. Editors: Michael Tighe, Neil Denslow  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
