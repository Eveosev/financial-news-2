Turkey ’s Ciner Holding AS will
begin construction next week of a $375 million glass factory in
an industrial zone in Bozuyuk, across the Marmara Sea from
Istanbul,  Dunya  reported.  The plant will begin making glass bottles, glass packaging
and jars next year at two furnaces, each with capacity of
150,000 tons a year, the newspaper said. The factory will be
expanded to four furnaces, equivalent to 40 percent of Turkey’s
total glass packaging production, Dunya said, without giving a
timeframe for the expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
