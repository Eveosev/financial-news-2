Eshraq Properties, an Abu Dhabi-
based real estate developer, more than doubled its installment
price in  Abu Dhabi  on its first trading day.  The shares rose to 51 fils at the 2 p.m. close in the
emirate. The company offered 825 million shares in an initial
public offering at 1 dirham each. Investors have paid 25 fils
and will pay the remainder within two years.  Eshraq Propertiesâ€™ IPO was oversubscribed as demand
outpaced the amount of shares offered, Royal Capital PJSC,
financial services company and manager of the share sale, said
May 12. The listing was the second in Abu Dhabi this year after
Insurance House, a company which offers property and casualty
insurance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
