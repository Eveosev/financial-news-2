John B. Chambers, a managing
director of rating company  Standard & Poor’s , said today that
there is a one-in-three chance of another U.S. debt downgrade in
the future, but there will “probably” be no change until late
2012 or 2013.  “Hopefully things turn around before than,” Chambers
said.  Chambers is chairman of S&P’s sovereign debt rating
committee. S&P is the rating company that downgraded the debt of
the  United States  to AA+ from AAA last month.  Chambers spoke today at the Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit in
New York, tied to the magazine’s ranking of the 50 most
influential leaders in global markets, finance, business and
government.   To contact the reporter on this story:
