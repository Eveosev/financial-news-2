China ’s supply of oil products is
sufficient after refineries maintained high processing volumes,
the nation’s top planner said.  Demand for oil products, including domestic production and
net imports and excluding inventory, increased 2.2 percent to
19.4 million metric tons last month from a year earlier, the
National Development and Reform Commission said in a  statement 
on its website today. Gasoline demand gained 4.6 percent, and
diesel rose 1.2 percent, it said. Oil demand for the first eight
months of the year increased 6.1 percent.  Oil-product inventory increased by 1.64 million tons as of
the end of August from a year earlier and is at “a normal
level,” the statement said, without giving details.  China’s daily oil-processing volume gained 6 percent to 8.7
million barrels last month from a year earlier and was little
changed from 8.86 million barrels a day in July, according to
National Bureau of Statistics data last week.  The nation’s natural-gas imports almost doubled to about
20.2 billion cubic meters in the first eight months, the planner
said in a separate  statement  on its website today. The share of
imported gas in terms of total consumption gained 8 percentage
points, it said. The nation’s total gas use increased 22 percent
to 84.2 billion cubic meters, it said.  -- Winnie Zhu, Jing Jin. Editors:  Mike Anderson ,  Bruce Stanley .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
