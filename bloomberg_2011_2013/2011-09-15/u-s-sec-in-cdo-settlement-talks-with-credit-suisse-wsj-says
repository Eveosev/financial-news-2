The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is in talks with Credit Suisse AG to settle civil
charges linked to the bank’s role as collateral manager on a $1
billion mortgage-bond deal in 2007, the Wall Street Journal
said, citing people familiar with the matter.  The talks are parallel with a deal being discussed with
 Citigroup Inc. (C) , where SEC officials are in the advanced stages
of reaching a settlement of more than $200 million on the
mortgage-bond product created by Citigroup and called Class V
Funding III; a collateral manager typically selects the assets
involved in such a deal, the newspaper said.  Officials from the SEC and Credit Suisse wouldn’t comment,
the WSJ added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
