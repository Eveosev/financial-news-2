The European Union’s proposals to
overhaul bank-capital rules for the region don’t deviate from
international agreements reached by the  Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision , said Jonathan Faull, the EU’s chief
financial services official.  People who have claimed that the EU wasn’t undertaking a
faithful implementation of the rules, known as Basel III, were
“simply wrong,” Faull said at the Eurofi financial forum in
Wroclaw,  Poland , today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
