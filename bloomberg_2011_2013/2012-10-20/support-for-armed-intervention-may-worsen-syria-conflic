Kofi Annan , the former United
Nations secretary general, said statements in favor of military
intervention in Syria may worsen the conflict.  “Sometimes by making these statements and raising the hope
of the people that the cavalry is on the horizon, you complicate
the situation,” Annan said in an interview to be aired tomorrow
on  CNN ’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.”  Annan resigned in August after six months as the UN’s
special envoy to Syria, saying his task was thwarted by
“finger-pointing and name-calling” in the UN’s decision-making
body, where Russia has used its veto to protect Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad’s regime. His departure was a blow to
international efforts to broker a diplomatic solution to the
country’s civil war.  Annan said Republican vice-presidential candidate  Paul Ryan 
was “dead wrong” to criticize U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s
support for Annan’s efforts to broker a peaceful solution,
according to a transcript of the interview provided by CNN.  Ryan, in an Oct. 12 debate with Vice President  Joe Biden ,
said Obama hadn’t done enough to prevent the violence in Syria.  Lakhdar Brahimi, who succeeded Annan in the special envoy
post, told the UN Security Council last month that reducing the
violence in Syria isn’t possible unless the world body is united
on a way to end the 18-month conflict. The Syrian conflict,
Brahimi said, threatens to further destabilize a region already
facing the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear
facilities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
