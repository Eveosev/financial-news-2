Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
slid for the first time in four days, led by petrochemicals and
banks, ahead of a week-long Islamic holiday.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  lost less than 0.1 percent to
6,809.30 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh.  Saudi Basic
Industries Corp. (SABIC) , or Sabic, the world’s largest petrochemical
maker, and Banque Saudi Fransi both dropped the most in a week.
 National Industrialization Co. (NIC)  fell to the lowest level since
April 6, 2011.  “The market will trade flat this week,” said Turki Fadaak, the head of research at Albilad Investment Co. in
Riyadh. “Third-quarter results won’t impact the market until
after the holidays.”  The Saudi bourse is closed Oct. 27-31 for the Islamic Eid
al-Adha holiday, one of the holiest periods of the Muslim
calendar. Saudi companies will finish reporting quarterly
results this week before the break.  Sabic reported on Oct. 17 a 23 percent decline in third-
quarter profit as prices for its products dropped amid slower
global economic growth. Net income fell to 6.31 billion riyals
($1.68 billion), according a company statement.  Sabic shares fell 0.6 percent to 89.50 riyals, while
National Industrialization lost 1 percent to 28.50 riyals.
 Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR)  fell 1 percent to 29.80 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
