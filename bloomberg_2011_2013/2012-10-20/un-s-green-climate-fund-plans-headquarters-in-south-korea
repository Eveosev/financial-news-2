The board of the  United Nations ’
Green Climate Fund, set up to channel $100 billion in aid
annually to developing nations by 2020, proposed South Korea as
the site of its planned headquarters.  The selection of Songdo, Incheon City, will be presented
for approval at the UN climate summit scheduled to start on Nov.
26 in Doha, Qatar, the board said today in a  statement .  The GCF was established in December at the last round of UN
climate-treaty talks in Durban, South Africa, to distribute some
of the aid pledged by developed nations to poorer countries
during previous sessions. Projects to be financed include
reducing  greenhouse gases  from energy production and adapting
countries to the effects of global warming such as rising sea
levels.  The other nations offering to host the GCF headquarters
were  Germany , Mexico, Namibia, Poland and Switzerland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
