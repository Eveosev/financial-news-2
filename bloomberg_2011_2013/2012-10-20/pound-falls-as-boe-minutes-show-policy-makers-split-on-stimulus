The pound fell against the euro this
week, reaching a four-month low, as minutes of the Bank of
England’s October meeting showed policy makers were split on the
need for more stimulus to boost the U.K. economy.  Britain’s currency dropped for a fourth week against the
dollar, the longest streak of declines since June, after central
bank policy maker David Miles said the U.K. economy is not
recovering as well as he had hoped. Gilts fell, pushing 10-year
yields to the highest level in a month.  “The pound is vulnerable to the weak economic fundamentals
in the U.K. and the comments from Miles suggest that the BOE
will add more stimulus,” said Lee Hardman, a currency
strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London . “The
pound is likely to remain on a weakening bias going forward.”  The pound depreciated 1 percent over the week to 81.38
pence per euro at 4:54 p.m. London time yesterday, when it
reached 81.47 pence, the weakest level since June 15. Sterling
declined 0.4 percent to $1.5997.  “Some members felt that there was considerable scope for
asset purchases to provide further stimulus,” according to the
Oct. 17 minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee’s Oct. 3-4
meeting.  Policy makers voted 9-0 to keep the bond-purchase target at
375 billion pounds at that meeting, the minutes showed. They
were also unanimous in holding the benchmark interest rate at a
record low of 0.5 percent.  Insignificant Growth  The pound has weakened 1.3 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 3.3
percent and the dollar dropped 3.2 percent.  “The state of the economy is not as good as I had hoped a
year or so back, I must admit,” Miles told the Guardian in an
interview published on Oct. 18. “The last 18 months have seen
no significant growth.”  Gross domestic product rose 0.6 percent in the third
quarter, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg before the data on Oct. 25. That would follow a
contraction of 0.4 percent in the second quarter. GDP will
shrink 0.3 percent over the year, according to a separate
Bloomberg survey, the first contraction since 2009.  “Even if growth picked up in the third quarter, the
overall trend in growth is still likely to be weak,” said Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ’s Hardman, who forecasts the pound will
fall toward $1.55 over the next six months.  Ten-year gilt yields climbed 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, over the week to 1.88 percent. The rate
reached 1.96 percent two days ago, the most since Sept. 17. The
1.75 percent security maturing September 2022 fell 1.43, or
14.30 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 98.83.  Gilts returned 1.8 percent this year through Oct. 18,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
2.2 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
