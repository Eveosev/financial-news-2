Petroleos Mexicanos’s liquefied
petroleum gas line to  Mexico ’s western state of Jalisco remains
shut while officials assess damages to the duct, according to an
article in  Reforma newspaper .  The state-controlled oil company, known as Pemex, said
yesterday in a statement that it was shutting the line after the
leak was caused on Oct. 18 by an accident involving construction
equipment.  The only distribution terminal affected is Guadalajara, the
nation’s second-largest metropolitan area, according to the
article. Reforma said the terminal has enough stored product to
satisfy its distribution program.  An official with Pemex didn’t immediately respond to a
request for additional information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
