Spain ’s 10-year bond yield fell to
the least in more than six months after Moody’s Investors
Service kept the nation’s credit rating at investment grade,
easing concern holders tracking indexes would be forced to sell
the debt.  The German 10-year yield climbed to a month-high even as
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said he’s not facing pressure to
seek a sovereign bailout after meeting with European Union
leaders in Brussels, damping demand for safer assets. The
Iberian nation sold more than its maximum target of securities
due in 2015, 2016 and 2022 at an auction on Oct. 18.  “Moody’s concluding Spain should keep its current rating
has bought a lot of relief and that should provide some kind of
lasting comfort to investors,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-
income strategist at Citigroup Inc. in  London . “Between now and
year-end the outlook has improved, thanks to the Moody’s
decision.”  Spain’s 10-year bonds advanced, pushing the yield down 25
basis points to 5.37 percent at 4:44 p.m. yesterday, the biggest
weekly slide since the five-days ended Sept. 7. The 5.85 percent
security due January 2022 rose 1.84, or 18.40 euros per 1,000-
euro face value, to 103.40.  The rate dropped to as low as 5.26 percent, the lowest
since April 2.  The benchmark Spanish yield slid as much as 34 basis points
on Oct. 17 after Moody’s assigned a negative outlook on its Baa3
rating, one step above junk, a day earlier. That’s the biggest
intraday tumble since European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  outlined details of the ECB’s bond-buying program on
Sept. 6.  Yield Spread  The additional yield investors demand to hold Spain’s 10-
year bonds over equivalent bunds has narrowed more than 110
basis points since Sept. 5 to 3.77 percent. ECB purchases are
conditional on the nation requesting sovereign aid. Moody’s
cited the willingness of the central bank to purchase Spain’s
government bonds on the secondary market in its decision.  The Iberian nation is set to auction three- and six-month
bills on Oct. 23, after the region of Galicia votes for its
regional assembly this weekend. The Basque Country also goes to
the polls, on Oct. 21.  Italy’s 10-year bond yields slid to as low as 4.70 percent
yesterday, the lowest level since March 9, after the nation sold
yesterday it received orders for more than 18 billion euros of
retail securities, double that of its two previous offers
combined. The benchmark rates lost 22 basis points in the week
to 4.77 percent.  German 10-year bund yields added 15 basis points to 1.60
percent, touching 1.66 percent two days ago.  Spain’s government bonds have returned 4.1 percent this
year through Oct. 18, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies,
while German debt has gained 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
