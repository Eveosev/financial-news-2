Dutch police have received 40 tips
on the theft of seven paintings, including works by  Pablo Picasso  and  Claude Monet , from the Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam
four days ago.  “We’re investigating the information,” the Rotterdam-
Rijnmond police said on its Twitter account today. In video
footage shown on Dutch television yesterday, two thieves are
seen rushing in to the museum through a side door, returning in
less than two minutes with large parcels on their backs.  The
footage  generated five tips, the police said.  The Rotterdam burglary ranks among the most spectacular art
heists in recent decades. Comparable incidents are the 2010
theft of five paintings -- including works by Picasso and
Matisse -- from the Musee d’Art Moderne in Paris, and the 1990
burglary from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston of
art worth an estimated $500 million.  The paintings stolen from Rotterdam’s Kunsthal were
Picasso’s “Tete d’Arlequin;” Monet’s “Waterloo Bridge,
 London ” and “Charing Cross Bridge, London;” Freud’s “Woman
with Eyes Closed;” Matisse’s “la Liseuse en Blanc et Jaune;”
Gauguin’s “Femme devant une fenetre ouverte, dite la Fiancee,”
and Meyer de Haan’s “Autoportrait.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
