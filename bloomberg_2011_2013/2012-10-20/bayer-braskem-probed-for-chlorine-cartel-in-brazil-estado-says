Bayer AG (BAYN)  and  Braskem SA (BRKM5)  are among
companies being investigated for forming a chlorine cartel in
Brazil, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing documents by the
Justice Ministry’s antitrust arm, known as SDE.  The chlorine makers agreed to assigned geographic
territories and took turns in bidding for contracts to supply
the government, the Sao Paulo-based Estado said. Chlorine is
used as a bleacher by the pulp industry and as a disinfectant
for public water.  Braskem was cited in the investigation because it’s a
member of the Abiclor industry association and all companies
that are members were mentioned in the probe, Braskem told
Estado. The story contains no comment from Bayer.  Spokesmen for Braskem and Bayer in Brazil didn’t
immediately return e-mails and phone calls from Bloomberg News
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
