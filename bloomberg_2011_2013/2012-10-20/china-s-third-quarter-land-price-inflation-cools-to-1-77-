China ’s land prices rose at a slower
annual pace for the fifth quarter, gaining 1.77 percent to an
average 3,093 yuan ($495) a square meter in the July to
September period, the  government  said.  Residential land prices gained 1.03 percent to 4,564 yuan a
square meter in the same period, according to the monitoring of
prices in 105 cities, the Ministry of Land and Resources said in
a statement on its website dated Oct. 19.  China’s September new home prices rose in fewer than half
the cities monitored by the government from a month earlier,
according to data released by the statistics bureau on Oct. 18,
indicating property curbs are stabilizing the housing market.  Land supply and demand are forecast to increase in the
fourth quarter amid government investments “to promote stable
and healthy economic development,” while land prices are
forecast to continue rising if no further real estate control
measures are introduced, the land ministry said.  Commercial land prices increased 3.2 percent in the third
quarter to 5,793  yuan  a square meter year-on-year, while
industrial rates gained 2 percent to 662 yuan a square meter,
according to the statement.  Land supply in China fell by 38 percent from a year earlier
to 54,300 hectares, with the supply of land to build homes
dropping 35 percent to 11,600 hectares, the government said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
