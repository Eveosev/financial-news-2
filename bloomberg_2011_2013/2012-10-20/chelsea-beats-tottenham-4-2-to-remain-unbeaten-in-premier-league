Chelsea came from behind to defeat
Tottenham 4-2 and remain unbeaten in English soccerâ€™s Premier
League.  Juan Mata scored twice and Gary Cahill and Daniel Sturridge
had one goal each as Chelsea rallied from a 2-1 deficit at White
Hart Lane in north  London . The Blues won for the seventh time in
eight matches and extended their lead at the top of the
standings to seven points over Manchester United and defending
champion Manchester City, who both play later today.  William Gallas and Jermain Defoe scored for Tottenham,
which lost for the first time in seven games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
