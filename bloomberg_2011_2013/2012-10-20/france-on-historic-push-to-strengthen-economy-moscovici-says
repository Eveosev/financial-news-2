The French government has embarked
on a “historic” drive to push through structural reforms and
to cut its  budget deficit  after the debt crisis revealed the
economy’s weakness, Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said.  Speaking in Berlin today, Moscovici said the Socialist
government of President  Francois Hollande  is tackling reforms
neglected by the previous regime, pursuing “fair” and
“reasonable” economic reforms and plans to keeping its deficit
next year from exceeding 3 percent of output.  “The crisis is showing up the weakness of the French
economy, it isn’t the cause of it,” Moscovici told reporters in
the German parliament after talks with Peer Steinbrueck, the
chancellor candidate of the opposition Social Democratic Party,
and German union leaders.  Germany’s SPD and unions back Hollande’s efforts to
underpin budget cuts with programs to boost economic growth, SPD
spokesman Hannes Schwarz said in an interview today. Moscovici
discussed a German union program called “Alliance for
Industrial Renewal in  Europe ” that aims to coordinate policy to
tap European Union Structural Funds, revenue from a financial-
transaction tax and European Investment Bank loans to finance
industrial programs, Schwarz said.  addre  To contact the reporter on this story:
