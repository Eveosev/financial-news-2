Shuaibu Mohammed Bama, a wanted
commander of the Nigeria Islamist group Boko Haram, was arrested
in the residence of a serving lawmaker in the northeastern city
of Maidguri, a military official said.  Bama was arrested by troops in Senator Ahmed Zanna’s
private residence in the Borno state capital on Oct. 18, Sagir
Musa, a military spokesman in the region, said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. He didn’t say if Zanna, who represents
Borno central constituency in the Senate, was also arrested.  In another incident, suspected Boko Haram members killed a
retired senior customs officer and his son today in the
northeastern town of Potiskum, in Yobe state, Patrick Egbuniwe,
police chief in the state, said in a phone interview.  Boko Haram, which wants to impose Islamic rule in  Africa ’s
largest oil producer, has claimed responsibility for bomb and
gun attacks in the mainly Muslim north and the capital, Abuja,
in which hundreds of people have died this year. The group has
targeted churches, government buildings, security forces and
moderate Muslims, killing more than 1,500 people since 2009, New
York-based Human Rights Watch said on Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
