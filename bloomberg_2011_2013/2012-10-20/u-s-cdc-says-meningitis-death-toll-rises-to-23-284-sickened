Twenty-three people in the U.S. have
died from a fungal meningitis outbreak linked to tainted steroid
injections for back pain, health authorities said.  The contaminated drugs are tied to 284 reported illnesses
in 16 states, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said today in an update posted on its website.
Included in the cases are three peripheral joint infections.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
