Suez Environnement (SEV) , Europe’s second-
biggest water company, denied that it is working on a merger
with its bigger rival  Veolia (VIE)  Environnement SA.  The Paris-based company, in a statement posted on its
website yesterday, denied that it is “working on a business
combination with Veolia.” Veolia, also based in Paris, said in
a BusinessWire statement that “following market rumors, a
merger with Suez Environnement is not on the agenda.”  The Wall Street Journal reported on its website yesterday
that Suez had approached Veolia about a merger and that talks
never reached the boards of the companies, citing three people
familiar with the situation.  Such a deal would have created a water and waste utility
company with a market value of more than $11 billion, the
Journal said.  Veolia, the biggest water company, has a market value of
4.4 billion euros ($5.7 billion), while Suez is valued at 4.3
billion euros.  A merger between the two companies is impossible as it
would create a monopoly with 90 percent of the water market in
France, Le Journal du Dimanche reported today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
