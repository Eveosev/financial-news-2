Canada  blocked Petroliam Nasional
Bhd.’s C$5.2 billion ($5.23 billion) takeover of   Progress
Energy Resources Corp. (PRQ) , in only the third rejection of a foreign
acquisition in 27 years.  Petronas has 30 days to appeal or provide additional
concessions, at which point the government will make a final
decision, according to a statement by Industry Minister
Christian Paradis.  “I can confirm that I have sent a notice letter to
Petronas indicating that I am not satisfied that the proposed
investment is likely to be of net benefit to Canada,” Paradis
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
