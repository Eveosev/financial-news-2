Palestinians are voting today to
elect officials in 92 municipalities across the  West Bank .  About 515,000 Palestinians are registered to vote in the
West Bank elections boycotted by Hamas, Hanna Nasser, head of
the Palestinian Central Election Commission, said at a
conference in Ramallah. The final results are due by Oct. 23.  Voting will not take place in the Gaza Strip, which is
controlled by Hamas. Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas , whose Fatah party governs the West Bank, cast his vote
and said he hoped future elections will take place as well in
Gaza and Jerusalem.  Hamas, which seized full control of Gaza in 2007 after
winning parliamentary elections a year earlier, is considered a
terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and European Union.
East Jerusalem, which is sought by the Palestinians as the
capital of any future state, is governed by Israel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
