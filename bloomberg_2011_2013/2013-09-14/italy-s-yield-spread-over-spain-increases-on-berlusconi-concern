Investors demanded higher yields to
hold  Italy (GBTPGR10) ’s 10-year bonds instead of Spain’s for the first time
in 18 months this week amid concern former Premier Silvio
Berlusconi may destabilize the coalition government.  Italy’s borrowing costs rose to the highest this year at a
sale of three-year debt as data  showed  industrial production in
the country unexpectedly fell in July. A Senate panel scheduled
a vote on whether to expel Berlusconi from the chamber for next
Wednesday. German bunds fell this week, pushing yields to a 21-month high amid speculation the Federal Reserve will announce a
plan to reduce its asset-purchase program on Sept. 18.  “The question mark over the longevity of the Italian
government is a pressing issue and that has been behind the
underperformance of  Italy  versus Spain,” said Richard McGuire,
senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in
London. “We’ve also had some disappointing data out of Italy.”  Italy’s 10-year yield rose eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, this week to 4.58 percent as of 5 p.m. London
time yesterday, a fourth consecutive weekly increase. The rate
reached 4.62 percent yesterday, the  highest  since June 27. The
4.5 percent security due in May 2023 dropped 0.565, or 5.65
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,328) face amount, to 99.78.  The rate on similar-maturity Spanish bonds declined three
basis points to 4.49 percent. It slid below its Italian
counterpart for the first time since March 2012 on Sept. 10. The
yield difference, or spread, between Spain’s and Italy’s 10-year
securities increased to nine basis points yesterday, the most
since March 2, 2012.  Yields Climb  Italian 10-year yields have climbed 18 basis points since
Berlusconi said on Aug. 30 that he would bring down the
government should Enrico Letta’s Democratic Party vote to oust
him from the Senate over tax fraud. The rate on Spanish 10-year
bonds has dropped five basis points in the same period, while
equivalent-maturity bund yields added 12 basis points.  Italy allotted 4 billion euros of three-year notes on Sept.
12 at an average yield of 2.72 percent, the  highest  since
October. The Senate voted on Sept. 11 to allow the Treasury to
raise the debt ceiling for this year to 98 billion euros from 80
billion euros.  Germany  is scheduled to auction 5 billion euros of two-year
notes on Sept. 18, while France and Spain plan to offer
government bonds the following day.  Benchmark  German 10-year (GDBR10)  bund yields increased three basis
points this week to 1.98 percent, after advancing to 2.09
percent on Sept. 11, the highest since Dec. 13, 2011.  “Looking at event risk near term, the biggie is the
Federal Reserve meeting,” Rabobank’s McGuire said. “That will
be key to determining not only how the Spanish auction is
received but also the German and the French. Market moves are
likely to be anchored in either direction as the market waits
for the outcome.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
