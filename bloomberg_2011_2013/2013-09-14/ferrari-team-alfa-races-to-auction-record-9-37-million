A 1935 Ferrari-team  Alfa Romeo  sold
yesterday for a record $9.37 million at a U.K. auction.  The Grand Prix car driven by Tazio Nuvolari had been
estimated at 5.5 million pounds ($8.73 million) to 6.5 million
pounds at hammer prices by Bonhams in its Goodwood Revival
auction. Its final price with fees was 5.9 million pounds.  “This is very special car,” Angela Cherrett, a U.K.
author of books on classic Alfa Romeos, said before the sale.
“I don’t think anyone else has got one with this history.”  Though single-seat racers are often deemed less desirable
than two- and four-seat cars, certain historic models are
increasingly prized by wealthy enthusiasts to show off at
exclusive Concours d’Excellence events, dealers said.  The price was an auction record for an Alfa and the second-highest for a car at an auction in  Europe , Bonhams said. The
racer was bought by an unidentified buyer in the Sussex
saleroom, underbid on the telephone.  The supercharged 8C-35 was part of the “Scuderia Ferrari
(F)” team founded by Enzo Ferrari that built and raced cars
under the Alfa name from 1929 to 1939. Bearing the trademark
“prancing horse” logo on the hood, the well-preserved plum-red
car competed in eight Grand Prix races before being driven to
victory by Nuvolari in the 1936 Coppa Ciano in  Italy .  The Alfa also has a distinguished auction history. The
U.K.-based collector Anthony Mayman paid $2.85 million for it at
a Bonhams auction in  Monaco  in 1989 -- at that time, an auction
record for a Grand Prix car. It has since been raced by two
further owners.  Fangio’s Mercedes  A 1954 silver Mercedes W196 that the five-times world
champion Juan Manuel Fangio drove to two Grand Prix victories
sold for 19.6 million pounds -- a record for any car at auction
-- at Bonhams’s 20th-anniversary “Festival of Speed” auction at
Goodwood in July.  Earlier in this latest Bonhams sale, a 1961 Jaguar E-Type
Series 1 convertible with single-family ownership and just
32,000 miles on the odometer sold for 225,500 pounds. The price,
achieved against an estimate of 120,000 pounds to 140,000
pounds, was an auction record for a road-going Jaguar E-Type,
Bonhams said.  Muse highlights include  Manuela Hoelterhoff  on arts,  Mark
