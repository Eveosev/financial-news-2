New York  Jets quarterback Mark
Sanchez was placed on injured reserve-designated for return,
meaning he’ll be sidelined for the next eight weeks, the
National Football League team said on its website.  Sanchez, 26, the Jets’ starter the past four seasons,
injured his right shoulder in the team’s third preseason game on
Aug. 24. Rookie Geno Smith has started the first two regular-season games and threw three interceptions in a 13-10 loss to
New England two days ago.  Sanchez is eligible to practice after six weeks and can
return to the active roster after eight weeks, the Jets said.  Sanchez, who is guaranteed $8.25 million this season, spent
the offseason competing with Smith for the starter’s job.
Sanchez was benched twice last season, when he committed an NFL-high 26 turnovers, including 18 interceptions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
