Hong Kong ’s government will drop
shark fin from menus at its entertainment functions and bar
officials from eating the product at events organized by others
amid global calls to protect the species.  The ban will extend to blue fin tuna and black moss and is
part of the city’s plans to adopt sustainable food-consumption
habits, the government said in a  press release  dated Sept. 13.
More than 73 million sharks’ fins are sliced off every year
globally, according to a June 20 statement from Korean Air Lines
Co. citing research data. The Seoul-based carrier joined Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd. and Air New Zealand Ltd. in refusing to
transport the commodity.  “The government will keep in view local and international
trends on green living in line with a sustainability-conscious
lifestyle and update the list of items from time to time,”
yesterday’s statement cited a spokesman as saying.  Hong Kong is the transit point for about half of the global
shark fin trade, which largely goes to the Chinese market, Alex
Hofford,  executive director  at MyOcean, a marine conservation
group, said in June. China said in July 2012 it would ban
officials from consuming shark fin at state expense within three
years.  “The Hong Kong government’s action should be praised,”  Ma
Jun , director with the Institute of Public and Environmental
Affairs, an environmental organization in Beijing, said today.
“Government institutes are regulators and large buyers. Banning
such items will have a symbolic and practical effect on
endangered species.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
