The  New York  Yankees lost 8-4 to
the Boston Red Sox on Jarrod Saltalamacchia’s grand slam and
also found out they may be without outfielder Brett Gardner for
the remainder of the Major League Baseball regular season.  Saltalamacchia’s home run with the bases loaded came in the
seventh inning last night and broke a 4-4 tie at Boston’s Fenway
Park. The Yankees had rallied from a 4-0 deficit to tie the
game.  Two nights ago in Baltimore, Gardner suffered a strain of
his left oblique on a checked swing during the team’s 6-5 win
against the Orioles. Manager Joe Girardi said yesterday that
Gardner, 30, may have played his last game of the season if the
muscle doesn’t heal quickly.  The Yankees (79-69) are vying for one of the two wild-card
playoff spots that go to non-division-winning teams in each
league. The Texas Rangers (81-65) and Tampa Bay Rays (80-66) now
hold the spots, with the Cleveland Indians (79-68), Yankees,
Baltimore Orioles (78-69) and Kansas City Royals (77-70) close
behind.  The Rangers lost 9-8 last night at home to the Oakland
Athletics. The Rays won 3-0 at the Minnesota Twins; the Indians
won 3-1 at the Chicago White Sox; Chris Davis hit his 50th home
run of the season as the Orioles triumphed 5-3 at the Toronto
Blue Jays, and the Royals lost 6-3 at the Detroit Tigers.  In  Boston , Stephen Drew had a two-run double as the Red Sox
took a 4-0 lead in the first inning.  Brendan Ryan hit his fourth home run of the season in the
third inning for the Yankees, Robinson Cano scored on Lyle Overbay’s sacrifice fly in the sixth and then Cano doubled in
the seventh for two more runs that tied the game 4-4.  ‘Big Loss’  Brandon Workman (6-3), the third of five Boston pitchers,
got the win. Loser Hiroki Kuroda (11-11) gave up five runs on
eight hits in six innings.  Gardner is hitting .273 in 145 games this season while
setting career highs with 147 hits, 33 doubles and eight home
runs. He leads the American League with 10 triples.  “It’s a big loss,” Girardi said. “We’ve had to overcome
a lot over the course of this year and we’re going to have to
continue to do that. People are going to have to step up in his
absence.”  In Toronto, Davis hit his major league-leading 50th home
run to break a 3-3 tie in the eighth inning as the Orioles ended
a three-game losing streak.  Davis matched Brady Anderson’s 1996 Orioles record and
became the third player in major league history with 50 home
runs and 40 doubles in the same season. The previous ones were
Babe Ruth in 1921 and Albert Belle in 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
