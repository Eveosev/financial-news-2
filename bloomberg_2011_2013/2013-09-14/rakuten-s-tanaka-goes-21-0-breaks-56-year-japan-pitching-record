Masahiro Tanaka  yesterday recorded
his 21st win without a loss this season, breaking a 56-year-old
Japanese pitching record, as his  Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles 
beat the Orix Buffaloes 6-2 last night in Sendai.  The 24-year-old right-hander broke the record of Kazuhisa
Inao, who started the 1957 season 20-0, according to the  Nippon
Professional Baseball Organization .  Tanaka’s achievement came days after Yakult Swallows
outfielder Wladimir Balentien matched the NPB record of 55 home
runs in a season, set by Sadaharu Oh in 1964 and matched by
Tuffy Rhodes in 2001 and Alex Cabrera in 2002. The Swallows are
set to  play  the Hanshin Tigers later today in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
