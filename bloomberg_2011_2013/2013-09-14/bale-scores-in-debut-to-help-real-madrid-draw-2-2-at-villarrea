Gareth Bale scored in his first
game for Real  Madrid , helping his new club to a 2-2 draw at
Villarreal in Spanish soccer’s Primera Liga.  Bale joined Real for a reported world-record fee of about
80 million-pounds ($127 million) from Tottenham of the English
Premier League earlier this month. The Welshman, who had yet to
play this season, started in midfield before being replaced by
Angel  Di Maria  in the 61st minute.  After Villarreal took the lead at its El Madrigal stadium
on Ruben Cani’s goal in the 20th minute, Real goalkeeper Diego
Lopez made several saves to keep his team close. Bale then tied
the score six minutes before halftime when he beat a defender to
poke in Daniel Carvajal’s cross.  Cristiano Ronaldo put Real in front midway through the
second half and Villarreal pulled even with 20 minutes remaining
on a goal from Giovanni dos Santos, another former Tottenham
player.  The draw left both teams two points behind Aletico Madrid
and Barcelona, who remained perfect in the league with their
fourth straight wins. Atletico beat Almeria 4-2 and Barcelona
defeated Sevilla 3-2 on Alexis Sanchez’s goal in stoppage time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
