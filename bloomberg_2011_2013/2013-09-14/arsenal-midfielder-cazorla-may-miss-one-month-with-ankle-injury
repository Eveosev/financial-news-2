Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla
may be sidelined for a month with an ankle injury, manager
Arsene Wenger said.  Cazorla sat out today’s 3-1 Premier League win at
Sunderland because of the injury and Wenger said the Spaniard
won’t play before the next break in the schedule for World Cup
qualifying on Oct. 11 and 15.  “He will be out for a few weeks,” Wenger said on
Arsenal’s website. “I don’t think he will play before the next
international break.”  Arsenal’s third straight win moved it into a tie at the top
of the standings with Tottenham and Liverpool, which has played
one fewer game, with nine points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
