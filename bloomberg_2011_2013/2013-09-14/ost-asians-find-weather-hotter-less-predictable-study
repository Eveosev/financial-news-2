Three out of four Asians say the
weather has become hotter and less predictable in the past
decade as a result of  climate change , prompting job changes,
migration and lifestyle adaptation, a study shows.  In  India , one of the world’s biggest producers of wheat,
sugar and rice, most respondents said shifting weather patterns
have led to water shortages, reduced agricultural productivity
and loss of income, according to the study released today by
 Climate Asia , a project backed by the British Broadcasting Corp.  Climate Asia surveyed 33,500 people in Bangladesh, China,
India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and Vietnam for the poll, the
biggest to assess how Asian populations perceive and respond to
climate change, it said. The data are released as more than 190
countries work on a successor treaty to the  Kyoto Protocol , the
United Nations accord that set binding carbon-reduction targets.  Bangladeshis are changing how they live more than any other
nation surveyed, with 36 percent saying they’ve adapted, for
example by growing different crops or migrating for work.
Indonesians are the most worried about food, with 30 percent
saying crop yields have fallen, according to the study.  Parties to the  UN climate talks  will meet in Warsaw in
November, Lima in late 2014 and Paris in 2015, where a new
treaty is scheduled to be agreed on.  To contact the reporter on this story:
