The U.K.’s pay curbs for state
workers must be maintained through 2018 to keep the country’s
recovery “on track,” Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said in an interview with the  Telegraph newspaper .  There’s a “long way to go” before living standards
recover to pre-crisis levels and decisions on private industry
wage increases should be decided by employers, said Alexander, a
member of the Liberal Democrat party. “As growth returns to our
economy and we see businesses being successful the workforce
will want to and should share in that success,” he said.  The Liberal Democrats, who make up the coalition government
with Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservatives, begin their
annual conference today in Glasgow, Scotland. The meeting, until
Sept. 18, seeks to set the tone for the 2015 general election
with attacks on the opposition  Labour Party  and Conservatives.  “I don’t think Labour on their own can be trusted to
deliver a strong economy,” Alexander said. “I don’t think the
Conservatives on their own can be trusted to deliver a fair
society.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
