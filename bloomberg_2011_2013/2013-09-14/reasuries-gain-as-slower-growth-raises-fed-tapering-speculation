Treasuries rose on speculation
weaker-than-forecast economic growth may prompt the  Federal
Reserve  to reduce its bond-buying program less than some
investors anticipated at next week’s meeting of policy makers.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes dropped from the more
than two-year high reached the prior week as reports showed
retail sales increased less than forecast,  consumer confidence 
slid more than projected and mortgage applications plunged. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  will decide at its Sept. 17-18
gathering to reduce monthly purchases of Treasuries to $35
billion from $45 billion, according to the median of 34
responses in a Bloomberg survey of economists this month.  “People are paying attention to data not exactly exploding
to the upside,” said Michael Lorizio, senior trader at Manulife
Asset Management in  Boston . “The Fed has laid out its plans.
The size may be scaled back.”  Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields declined five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.89 percent this week in New York,
Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The 2.5 percent note due in
August 2023 rose 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face amount, to 96
22/32.  The five-year Treasury note yield fell six basis points to
1.69 percent, its biggest drop since the week ended July 19.  Traders are pricing in a 66 percent likelihood that the Fed
raises its benchmark overnight rate by January 2015, down from
72.4 percent a week ago.  Weakening Data  Retail sales rose in August 0.2 percent, the  least  in four
months, following a revised 0.4 percent July gain that was
bigger than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said
yesterday. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 0.5 percent advance.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
September index of consumer sentiment fell to 76.8 from 82.1
last month, which was the lowest since April. A Bloomberg survey
estimated a reading of 82.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index dropped 13.5
percent in the period ended Sept. 6 to the lowest level since
October 2008, the Washington-based trade group said Sept. 11.  “With economic data clearly hitting a skid and taking a
turn toward the weaker side, investors are starting to think
that maybe the first step of the Fed’s taper won’t be as large
as initially thought, and that is giving Treasuries a bid,”
said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of
government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. “The big
question is what the Fed will do if we continue to see
weakness.”  Annual Loss  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index dropped to 96.17 yesterday, the lowest
level since Aug. 27. It climbed on Sept. 5 to 114.19, a two-month high. The 2013 average is 71.  U.S. government bonds have lost investors 0.5 percent since
the end of August, on pace for a fifth monthly decline, the
longest since a seven-month slump ended March 2011, according to
the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY)  The securities have lost
investors 3.8 percent in 2013, according to data as of Sept. 12.  The median forecast of analysts’ predictions compiled by
 Bloomberg News  from Sept. 6 to Sept. 11, is for the 10-year
yield to end the year at 2.85 percent and to rise to 3.1 percent
by the end of June 2014.  ‘Soft Launch’  Fed policy makers will also maintain mortgage-bond buying
at  $40 billion  under the Fed’s quantitative-easing program, the
survey shows.  “It will be a soft launch,” said  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S.
economist in New York at Royal Bank of Canada’s  RBC Capital
Markets , one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the
central bank.  The U.S. central bank has kept the  federal-funds target
rate  at a record-low range of zero to 0.25 percent since
December 2008. The Fed will release its 2016 economic
 projections  next week for the first time, including the outlook
for the benchmark rate.  In their June  assessment , 19 FOMC members were divided on
the appropriate benchmark rate in 2015, with four participants
saying 1 percent. Three projected 3 percent, three forecast 1.5
percent and another three saw 0.75 percent.  The gap between yields on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and debt not indexed for inflation is 2.11
percentage points, down from 2.26 percentage points a month ago
and from 2.61 percentage points on Feb. 4, the high for 2013.
The difference represents the bond market’s forecast for the
average rise in the  consumer price index  during the life of the
securities.  Auction Demand  The yield on 10-year TIPS, 0.79 percent, is down from 0.91
percent on Sept. 5. The yield that day was the highest since
April 2011. The U.S. will auction $13 billion of 10-year TIPS on
Sept. 19.  Demand for  U.S. government debt  increased this week at the
auctions of $65 billion of U.S. notes and bonds. The $13 billion
of 30-year debt sold Sept. 12 attracted bids valued at 2.4 times
the amount offered, versus 2.11 last month. The bid-to-cover
ratio rose to 2.86 at the $21 billion offering of 10-year notes
on Sept. 11, from 2.45 last month, while the three-year note
sale on Sept. 10 had the ratio rise to 3.29 from 3.21.  Investors have bid $2.88 for each dollar of the $1.508
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this
year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
