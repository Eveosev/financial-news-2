Poland’s economy is recovering
after a phase of weakness and may grow more than the government
and central bank predict, according to Deputy Finance Minister
Jacek Dominik.  “It looks like it’s starting to improve,” Dominik said in
an interview today in Vilnius,  Lithuania , where he attended a
meeting of European Union finance chiefs. “We’ve had two or
three quarters with not that good results, but we have a sign of
recovery,” he said, adding that he sees growth of “between 1
and 2 percent.”  Poland is benefiting from the revival of the euro-area
economy, which emerged from the longest recession in its history
last quarter and buys half of the country’s exports. Earlier
this month, Prime Minister Donald Tusk forecast economic growth
may exceed the government’s prediction of as much as 1.5
percent. The central bank sees an expansion of 1.1 percent.  In the second quarter, gross domestic product rose 0.8
percent from a year earlier after increasing 0.5 percent in the
three months through March.  “We had a much greater slowdown than we expected, but now
it looks like things are picking up,” Dominik said. “It’s
extremely difficult right now to be very precise, because we
have just a few months” of improving indicators, he said.  Polish industrial production increased the most in 18
months in July and the gauge of manufacturing output climbed for
a second month in August, according to a survey of  purchasing
managers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
