President  Barack Obama  plans mark
the five-year anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and
the economic gains made since then, the White House said in a
statement.  Obama plans to make a speech in the Rose Garden on Sept. 16
and will warn against “more self-inflicted wounds from
Washington” as Congress considers a new budget and debates an
increase in the debt ceiling, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
