The defending champion  Czech
Republic  beat Argentina in doubles to reach the final of
tennis’s Davis Cup.  Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek defeated Carlos Berlocq
and Horacio Zeballos 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 to give the Czechs an
unbeatable 3-0 lead in the best-of-five semifinal in Prague.
They’ll meet Serbia or Canada in November for the title.  Canada leads Serbia 2-1 in the other semeifinal in Belgrade
after  Daniel Nestor  and Vasek Pospisil beat Nenad Zimonjic and
Ilija Bozoljac 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 10-8 in a 4 1/2-hour match. The Canadians need to win one of tomorrow’s two
reverse singles matches to advance to the final of the top team
event in men’s tennis for the first time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
