General Motors Co. (GM)  and Canada’s
Unifor union reached a tentative settlement on a new collective
agreement that covers employees of the company’s CAMI assembly
plant in Ontario.  Union members will vote on the accord at a meeting in
 London , Ontario, tomorrow starting at 3 p.m.  New York  time,
Unifor said today in an e-mailed statement. Details of the
agreement will be released upon ratification.  Unifor was created last month by the merger of the Canadian
Auto Workers and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers
union. It represents about 2,500 employees at the GM facility in
Ingersoll, Ontario, the automaker said in a separate statement
confirming the accord.  The plant in Ingersoll bargains separately from other GM
plants represented by Unifor. Those factories reached a four-year labor agreement last year, which cut the hourly rate for
new hires to C$20.40 ($19.71) from C$23.80. The agreement was
similar to agreements reached with  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler
Group LLC.  GM on  March 8  announced plans to invest in the Ingersoll
plant to install body shop equipment and tools to permit the
factory to build more types of vehicles. The factory’s current
products include the Chevrolet Equinox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
