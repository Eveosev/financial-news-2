U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  says his Liberal Democrat party has played a key role in
reviving the economy and making coalition government policies
fairer, in an interview with the Independent newspaper.  “We need to be unabashed about the fact that we have
played a vital, even pivotal, role in saving the British economy
and a leading role in providing fairness in the tax, education
and skills systems and greening our economy for the future,” he
said in a  report  published as the party conference starts today.  The conference, under the slogan “Stronger Economy, Fairer
Society,” will seek to set the tone for the 2015 general
election with attacks on the opposition Labour Party and Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservatives.  Clegg defended the coalition’s economic policies as “not
an act of fiscal masochism” but a measured and stable approach.
While the economy has a long way to go, “we have turned a
corner and passed through the darkest hour,” which wouldn’t
have been possible if the  Liberal Democrats  hadn’t been in
government with the Conservatives, he said.  “We need to explain that this country would be very
different indeed -- in my view a lot less fair -- if the
Conservatives had been left to their own devices,” he said.  The Liberal Democrat conference runs until Sept. 18 in
Glasgow,  Scotland . Delegates will debate motions on policies
ranging from the economy and tax to pornography and cycling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
