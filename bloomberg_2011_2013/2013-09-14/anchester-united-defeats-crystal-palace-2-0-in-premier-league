Manchester United beat 10-man
Crystal Palace 2-0 in English soccer’s Premier League to give
new manager David Moyes his first home win.  Robin van Persie  scored with a penalty kick just before
halftime and Wayne Rooney scored with a free kick with nine
minutes remaining at Old Trafford in Manchester.  Van Persie’s penalty kick in the 45th minute came after
Kagisho Dikgacoi was ruled to have fouled  Ashley Young . Referee
Jon Moss also gave Dikgacoi a red card, drawing the ire of the
Palace players.  United ended a two-match goalless run after drawing 0-0
with Chelsea in its opening home game and losing 1-0 at
Liverpool in its most recent match on Sept. 1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
