Competition by  Germany ’s regions to
produce renewable energy as the country shifts away from nuclear
and coal power could cause overcapacity if the process isn’t
coordinated, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will meet with state premiers next
week to discuss greater cooperation as regional governments
develop plans to build wind and clean-energy capacity, the
newspaper said. Competing plans could cause overcapacity in the
coming decades, the FTD cited Hildegard Mueller, who heads the
BDEW industry association, as saying.  The northern state of Schleswig-Holstein aims to produce by
2020 three times more energy from offshore wind parks than its
population uses, and southern states such as Bavaria are
planning more energy self-sufficiency, the newspaper said.  Overcapacity could be costly for consumers because German
regulations require them to pay for unused power generation, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
