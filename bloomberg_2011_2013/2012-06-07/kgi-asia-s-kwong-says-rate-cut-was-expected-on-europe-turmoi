Ben Kwong , chief operating officer at
Hong Kong-based KGI Asia Ltd., comments on China’s decision to
cut interest rates for the first time since 2008.  “The rate cut is long awaited because of the continuing
turmoil in Europe and also the signs of further slowing of the
Chinese economy.”  “The market already expected the major countries will have
this kind of a stimulus package to be introduced to boost the
 market sentiment .”  “This is the first time they have started the downward
interest rate cycle. I don’t think China will act aggressively,
it will be gradual.”  “I think in six months down the road, we’ll see another
one or two quarter percent rate cuts and maybe some other
measures, like the continued reduction of the reserve ratio.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
