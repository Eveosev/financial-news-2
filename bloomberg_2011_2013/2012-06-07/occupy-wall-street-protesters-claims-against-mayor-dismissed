Occupy Wall Street protesters
arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge last year can’t proceed with
claims against New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg or the city’s
police commissioner, a judge ruled.  The protesters can pursue claims against individual police
officers, according to a court order today by U.S. District
Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan.  The mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
