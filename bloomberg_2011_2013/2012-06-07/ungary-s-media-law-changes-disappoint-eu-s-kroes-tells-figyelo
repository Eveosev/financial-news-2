Hungary’s changes to its media law
failed to address concerns of the European Union and the  Council
of Europe , Neelie Kroes, the 27-nation bloc’s commissioner for
digital affairs, told  Figyelo .  Hungary’s amendments to the law addressed 11 of 66
recommendations of the Council of  Europe , without guaranteeing
the independence of the Media Authority or clarifying all
ambiguities, Kroes said in an interview with the Budapest-based
weekly newspaper.  The status of the media law remains “embarrassing” as the
government failed to deliver on its promises, Kroes said,
according to Figyelo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
