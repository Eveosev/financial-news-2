Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Tsiodras condemned an assault by a member of the anti-immigrant
 Golden Dawn  party on two members of rival parties during a
television show.  “The government condemns in the most categorical manner
the attack by the spokesman of the Golden Dawn party Elias
Kasidiaris on Liana Kanelli and Rena Dourou,” Tsiodras said in
an e-mailed statement in Athens today. “Political differences
can’t be resolved with violence.”  Tsiodras called on the Golden Dawn party to condemn the
incident and said judicial officials were investigating the
incident. Kasidiaris threw water at Dourou, a member of the
anti-bailout Syriza party, before punching Kanelli, a member of
the Greek Communist Party. The images were  broadcast  live on the
private ANT1 television channel.  Golden Dawn said in a statement that Kanelli had struck
Kasidiaris first, with no provocation, the  Athens  News Agency
reported.  An arrest warrant for Kasidiaris, who is the party’s press
spokesman, was issued by Greek authorities following the attack,
the news service said.  Golden Dawn entered Parliament for the first time in the
May 6 election, garnering 7 percent of the vote as it
capitalized on rising frustration among austerity-hit Greeks
against illegal immigration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
