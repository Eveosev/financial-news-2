What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade as demand may rise after  China  cut
borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 and loosened
controls on banksâ€™ lending rates in an effort to spur the
economy, Dewey Strickler, the president of Ag Watch Market
Advisers in Franklin,  Kentucky , said by telephone.  -- Soybean futures may open up 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel in
Chicago on expected increases in demand from China and as warm,
dry weather in the U.S. curbs crop prospects, Strickler said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent
higher per pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3
higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as demand may climb and as dry weather in the
eastern U.S. Midwest may hurt plants that are about to be
harvested, Strickler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
