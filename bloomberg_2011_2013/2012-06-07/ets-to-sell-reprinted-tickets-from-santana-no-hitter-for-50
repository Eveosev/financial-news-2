The  New York Mets  will sell reprinted
tickets from Johan Santana’s franchise-first no-hitter for $50
each.  The Major League Baseball team said in a news release today
that the mementos would be printed on “Season Ticket Holder
stock” for all 41,922 seats in Citi Field. The game drew a
crowd of just over 27,000. Season-ticket holders will receive
complimentary reprints, and discounts will be offered to fans
holding partial-season ticket plans. The sale starts June 11.  Santana beat the St. Louis Cardinals 8-0 on June 1, the
first no-hitter in the history of the team that began play in
1962.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
