Liu Li-Gang, head of Greater China
economics at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in  Hong
Kong , comments on China’s decision to cut  interest rates  for the
first time since 2008.  “Symbolically this is very important as this indicates
that monetary policy is no longer in a state of fine-tuning, and
is now in a stage of becoming more accommodating. Inflationary
pressure is falling and this sets the stage for the PBOC to
lower interest rates.”  “This was also to try and alleviate the borrowing costs
for Chinese firms. We think interest rate cuts will still be
measured going forward. More importantly the PBOC will continue
to lower reserve requirement ratios by injecting more liquidity
into the banking system. More cuts to interest rates will be
dependent on the outlook in inflation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
