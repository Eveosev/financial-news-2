Dialight Plc (DIA) , a maker of light-
emitting diode products, said its U.S. unit bought the assets of
lighting-control company Airinet Inc. for $2.6 million to expand
energy-saving technology operations in the U.S.  Dialight Corp. will pay as much as $7.4 million more,
depending on sales through 2020, and Airinet workers and patent
applications transfer to the company, it said today in an e-
mailed statement. Airinet, based in Pueblo,  Colorado , develops
technology that can vary illumination depending on natural light
or who is using a building, according to the statement.  Dialight, based in Suffolk, England, assumes no debt and
expects the deal to add to earnings as soon as 2013, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
