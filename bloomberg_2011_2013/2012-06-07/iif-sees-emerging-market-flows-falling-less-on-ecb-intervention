Private investments in  emerging
markets  will probably fall about 11 percent this year,
contracting less than forecast after European Central Bank
funding reduced pressure on banks to scale back business,
according to the Institute of International Finance Inc.  Flows to emerging markets will fall to about $912 billion
this year from $1.03 trillion last year, the IIF said today. The
institute in January said flows would contract to as little as
$746 billion this year.  ECB three-year loans of more than 1 trillion euros ($1.26
trillion) helped increase flows to emerging markets and
moderated the pace of bank deleveraging, the IIF said in a
report presented in Copenhagen today. Capital flows should rise
to about $994 billion in 2013 while risks remain, it said.  “We anticipate that economic and financial tensions in the
euro area will persist for some time and subside only very
gradually in 2013,” said IIF deputy managing director and chief
economist Philip Suttle. “Despite the large upward revision,
capital flows this year are still projected to decline in  Asia ,
by around 15 percent, in particular  China ,” he said.  Emerging markets in Asia will account for about 44 percent
of flows in 2013 from 52 percent in 2011, according to the IIF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
