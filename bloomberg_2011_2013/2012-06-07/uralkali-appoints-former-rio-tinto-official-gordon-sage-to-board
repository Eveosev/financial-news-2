OAO Uralkali, a Russian potash
producer, appointed former Rio Tinto Group official Gordon Sage
as an independent board member.  Sage held “senior posts” at Rio from 1970 through 2001
and served on boards of companies including ERM Group Holdings
and Blackrock World Mining Trust, Uralkali said in a statement.
Uralkali shareholders approved a 2011 dividend of about $378
million, or 4 rubles a share and $0.61 a depositary receipt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
