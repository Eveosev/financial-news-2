The pound strengthened to a one-week
high against the dollar and gilts fell after the  Bank of England 
kept its stimulus program unchanged and  China  cut borrowing
costs to boost growth.  Sterling rose versus all except one of its 16 major
counterparts after a report showed U.K. services grew more in
May than analysts forecast. Policy makers held the bond-purchase
program at 325 billion pounds ($505 billion) and their benchmark
rate at a record-low 0.5 percent. The decision to refrain from
increasing stimulus was  predicted  by 37 of 42 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG,
and Morgan Stanley were among banks that forecast an expansion.  “The BOE decided not to move and sterling’s rise is
reflecting that,” said  Gavin Friend , a markets strategist at
 National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  in London. “Playing across this is
the China move to spur their economy and that’s generally
supportive to risk assets.”  The pound advanced 0.3 percent to $1.5549 at 4:35 p.m.
London time after rising to $1.5601, the strongest level since
May 30. Sterling gained 0.6 percent to 80.70 pence per euro, and
appreciated 0.9 percent to 123.86 yen.  China cut  interest rates  for the first time since 2008,
lowering the one-year deposit rate to 3.25 percent from 3.5
percent effective tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said on
its website. The one-year lending rate will fall to 6.31 percent
from 6.56 percent.  Services Expand  The U.K. services gauge based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  held at 53.3 from April, Markit Economics and the
 Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said in London.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a decline to
52.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Sterling has gained 2 percent this year, the best performer
among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, as investors fleeing the fiscal
turmoil in the euro bloc purchased U.K. assets as a haven. The
dollar rose 1.9 percent, and the euro dropped 1.7 percent.  “The pound may try and break higher,”  Lee Hardman , a
currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in
London, said before the BOE decision. “Any relief will only be
temporary for the pound, because expectations will shift to the
next meeting. We still think the pound remains under downward
pressure because the U.K. economy will weaken.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.72 percent. The 4 percent bond due March
2022 fell 0.615, or 6.15 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
120.335. The yield declined to a record 1.439 percent on June 1.  ECB Ready  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday
officials stand ready to act as the growth outlook worsens in
the euro area, Britain’s biggest trading partner. While the ECB
left its benchmark rate at 1 percent, Draghi said “a few”
governing council members sought a cut.  In addition to the threats to the U.K. from the euro area,
Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s fiscal squeeze is also weighing
on Britain’s economy. The  International Monetary Fund  said on
May 22 the U.K. may require further stimulus “via further QE
and possibly cutting the policy rate.”  Cameron today called on the euro-region to step up efforts
to contain the sovereign debt crisis.  “The first priority is to stabilize the financial
situation,” the prime minister said in Norway. “That means
recapitalization of banks, it means building of firewalls, it
means reassuring markets.”  Gilts have returned 2.8 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds rose 3.8 percent, and
U.S. Treasuries gained 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
