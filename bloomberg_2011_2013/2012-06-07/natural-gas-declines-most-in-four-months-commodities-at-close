The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24  raw materials  fell 0.2 percent to settle at 592.05 at 3:49
p.m.  New York  time, led by natural gas.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26 prices advanced 0.3
percent to 1,443.15.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas fell the most in four months after a government
report showed that U.S. inventories rose more than forecast.  The Energy Department said that supplies in the week ended
June 1 rose 62 billion cubic feet to 2.877 trillion. Analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an increase of 58
billion.  Gas prices  have dropped 24 percent this year as the
warmest January-to-May weather on record crimped demand for the
heating and power-plant fuel.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gas futures for July
delivery slid 6.1 percent to $2.274 per million British thermal
units, the biggest decline since Jan. 31.  U.K. gas for delivery today and tomorrow declined as flows
increased from  Norway  and a liquefied natural-gas terminal in
the southeast of  England .  Gas fell as low as 54.2 pence a therm and was at 54.3 pence
at 4:28 p.m. London time. That’s equivalent to $8.45 per million
Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures tumbled the most in two months as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  refrained from outlining steps
that the central bank may take to bolster the economy amid risk
from Europe’s debt crisis.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for August delivery
fell 2.8 percent to $1,588 an ounce, the biggest decline for a
most-active contract since April 4.  Silver futures for July delivery dropped 3.3 percent to
$28.529 an ounce, the largest slump since April 23.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery slid 1.9 percent to $1,440.90 an ounce. Palladium
futures for September delivery declined 1.1 percent to $625.75
an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the sixth time in seven sessions after
Bernanke said the  U.S. economy  is at risk from Europe’s debt
crisis and fiscal tightening, without discussing steps to
protect growth.  On the Comex, copper futures for July delivery slid 0.3
percent to $3.3705 a pound. The metal has dropped 2.6 percent
since May 29.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months gained 1.1 percent to $7,495 a metric ton ($3.40 a
pound).  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell on Bernanke’s comments, tempering optimism
over a cut in Chinese interest rates.  On the Nymex, oil futures for July delivery slid 0.2
percent to $84.82 a barrel.  Brent oil for July settlement decreased 0.7 percent to
$99.93 a barrel on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  BP Plc bought three cargoes of Forties blend with two at
higher prices than yesterday. The company also booked a very
large crude carrier to transport North Sea crude to  South Korea 
later this month, raising the number of supertankers involved to
14 since mid-December, according to tanker reports.  Vitol Group failed to sell Russian Urals at a smaller
discount than the last trade in the Mediterranean.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline retreated as remarks by Bernanke to Congress
raised doubts that the central bank would institute a third
round of quantitative easing to boost the economy.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for July delivery fell 0.2
percent to $2.685 a gallon, the first decline this week.  Heating-oil futures for July delivery dropped 0.2 percent
to $2.6671 a gallon.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cotton futures jumped the most in more than three years on
speculation that demand will pick up after  China , the world’s
top user, cut  interest rates  to spur its slowing economy.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, cotton for December
delivery rose 5.7 percent to 72.28 cents a pound, the biggest
gain since Dec. 8, 2008.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery slid 0.7 percent to
19.76 cents a pound.  Cocoa futures for July delivery advanced 1 percent to
$2,226 a metric ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery gained 0.5 percent
to $1.5665 a pound.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$1.156 a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybeans rose the most in two months on speculation that
demand will grow in China, the world’s biggest hog producer,
after it cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 to
reverse an economic slowdown.  On the  Chicago  Board of Trade, soybean futures for November
delivery, the contract with the greatest open interest, advanced
3.2 percent to $13.4125 a bushel, the biggest gain since March
30.  Corn futures for July delivery climbed 1.3 percent to $5.94
a bushel, after touching $6.015, the highest since May 24.  Wheat futures for July delivery gained 2.8 percent to

demand for pork.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for July
settlement climbed 0.7 percent to 93.325 cents a pound. Earlier,

$1.20425 a pound, the biggest gain since May 18.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.7
percent to settle at $1.591 a pound.  -- With assistance from  Matthew Brown  and Sherry Su in  London ;
