Siberia, which combines 12 regions in
 Russia , the world’s third-biggest  wheat exporter , is seeking
opportunities to ship cereals to the Asia-Pacific region,
Russia’s Grain Producers Union said.  Russia now sends just over 1 percent of its grain exports
to  South Asia , with most cargoes going to the  Middle East  and
North Africa, where the country shipped more than 17 million
metric tons of wheat and 3 million tons of barley in the current
season through June 30, said Pavel Skurikhin, the union
chairman.  Siberia’s average annual grain harvest was 14.5 million
tons starting in 2007, including a surplus of 2 million to 2.5
million tons after covering local consumption for a year,
Skurikhin said at the 5th Russian-Japanese Investment Forum in
the city of Kazan, according to a  statement  on the union’s
website today.  The Siberian Federal District accounted for almost 16
percent of Russia’s grain output last year with a harvest of
about 15 million tons, according to state statistics.  Wheat for July delivery fell 0.4 percent to $6.22 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade by 12:21 p.m. Moscow time. The
grain has dropped 4.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
