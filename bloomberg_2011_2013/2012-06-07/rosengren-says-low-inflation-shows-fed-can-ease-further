The Federal Reserve can consider
further monetary-policy easing because of low inflation and the
weak U.S. job market, Federal  Reserve Bank  of Boston President
 Eric Rosengren  said.  “That gives us some flexibility to think about additional
monetary-policy accommodation,” he said today at an Institute
of International Finance conference in Copenhagen.  Rosengren said he expects U.S. gross domestic product to
grow 2.3 percent this year. Inflation will probably be lower
than the roughly 2 percent target the Fed aims to preserve, he
said, citing forecasts for personal consumption expenditure
measures.  “I do think we’ll undershoot on inflation over the course
of this year, both PCE total and core, expected to be about 1.7
percent,” he said. “That does mean we’re going to be missing
somewhat significantly on both sides of our mandate.”  Rosengren urged the Fed to focus on housing if it decides
to expand its balance sheet, because U.S. housing markets face
headwinds even as they pick up steam. He said he’s “pretty
confident” that unconventional monetary-policy actions can make
a “significant difference” helping to spur a recovery.  The  Federal Reserve  is responsible for the dual goals of
price stability and full employment. For 2012, Rosengren is an
alternate member of the  Federal Open Market Committee , the Fed’s
monetary policy-setting panel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
