President  Dennis Lockhart  said the European debt crisis has
worsened in the past six weeks, raising the risk the region’s
slump will hurt U.S. growth.  “I am giving more weight and higher probability to a
negative influence on our economy coming from Europe than I did
as recently as the last FOMC meeting in late April,” Lockhart
said in a speech in Dallas, Georgia, referring to the policy-
making Federal Open Market Committee. His prepared remarks on
the  U.S. economy  repeated his speech from yesterday in  Fort
Lauderdale , Florida.  Lockhart, who has a vote on the FOMC this year, reiterated
his view that policy makers need to take further action to
stimulate the economy if it becomes clear growth is slowing.
Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren  said today the Fed has
“some flexibility” for more easing, while Fed Vice Chairman
Janet Yellen said yesterday that “stalled” improvement in the
labor market and weak financial conditions could call for more
accommodation.  Lockhart, 65, a former Georgetown University professor, has
led the Atlanta Fed since 2007. The Atlanta Fed district
includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and portions of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Tennessee.  To contact the reporters on this story:
