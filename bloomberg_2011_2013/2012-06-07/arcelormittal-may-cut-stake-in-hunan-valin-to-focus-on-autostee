ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s biggest
steelmaker, may sell part of its stake in Hunan Valin Steel Co.,
as it moves to increase its holding in an automotive steel
partnership with the Chinese company’s parent, gaining more
direct exposure to the world's largest car producer.  ArcelorMittal will raise its ownership in Valin
ArcelorMittal Automotive to 49 percent from 33 percent and boost
its  capital investment  by 15 percent to 5.2 billion  yuan  ($817
million), the company said in a statement dated yesterday. The
Luxembourg-based company also concluded a put option agreement
that will enable it to sell as much as a 19.9 percent stake, or
600 million shares, in Hunan Valin to Valin Group, reducing its
holding to 10.07 percent.  Increasing its stake in the unit will boost ArcelorMittal’s
direct share of China's autosteel market. Production capacity at
the venture, set to become operational in the first half of 2014,
will be increased by 25 percent to 1.5 million tons,
ArcelorMittal said today.  “This is a good opportunity to create value for our
shareholders and further enhance our participation in both  China 
and the automotive market more broadly,” Sudhir Maheshwari,
ArcelorMittal’s group management board member responsible for
China, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
