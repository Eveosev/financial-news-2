Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  , a U.K.-based oil and
gas explorer, found oil at its Paon-1X exploration well off
Ivory Coast, extending discoveries made in Ghana.  Drilling encountered 31 meters (102 feet) of net oil in a
gross interval of 74 meters of turbidite sands, the company said
in a statement today. Data suggests the well is a continuous
hydrocarbon column of light oil, Tullow said.  “The discovery of light oil in our first well in CI-103
extends the proven play for oil westwards from our successes in
Ghana and is encouraging for our future exploration efforts
elsewhere in this license,” Exploration Director Angus McCoss
said. The company will pursue further drilling in 2013, he said.  Tullow rose 30 pence, or 2.1 percent, to 1,468 pence in
London trading. The stock has risen 4.7 percent this year,
valuing the company at 13.3 billion pounds ($20.7 billion).  Output from  Ghana ’s Jubilee oil field reached about 70,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day in May, with production expected
to reach an average of 90,000 barrels this year, Tullow said at
the time. The explorer has found about 4 billion barrels since
2007, unlocking new oil provinces in Uganda, Ghana and French
Guyana.  Tullow controls 45 percent of the Ivory Coast license,
 Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  has a 40 percent holding and the
remainder is held by  Petroci Holding .  “This discovery confirms the upper cretaceous fan system
present in Ghana extends westward into Cote d’Ivoire and
provides significant running room within the CI-103 block,”
Anadarko Worldwide Exploration Vice President  Bob Daniels  said
separately. “We are very encouraged by these results.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
