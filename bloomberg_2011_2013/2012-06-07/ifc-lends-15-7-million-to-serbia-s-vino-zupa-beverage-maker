The  International Finance Corp .
approved a 12.5 million euro ($15.7 million) loan to  Vino Zupa (VINZ) 
AD, a Serbian beverage maker, to expand production and improve
efficiency.  The loan will “support additional bottling and fruit
concentrate production capacity, as well as improvements in
 energy supply  and wastewater treatment,” the IFC, the  World
Bank ’s private lending arm, said in an e-mail today.  The IFC’s investment portfolio in Serbia is more than $700
million, including financing from partners, the Washington-based
lender said. The latest loan is part of efforts to boost
agriculture output that accounts for 21 percent of Serbia’s
gross domestic product.  Vino Zupa sales rose 24 percent in 2011 to 5.64 billion
dinars ($62 million), while its net income fell 26 percent to
252 million dinars from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
