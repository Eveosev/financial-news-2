Fluor Corp. (FLR) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. engineering and construction company, expects to win
more than $8.3 billion in new oil and gas business this year,
boosted by contracts in  North America .  “It’s still a highly competitive market, but we expect to
see growth in awards in 2012,” Peter Oosterveer, president of
Fluor’s energy and chemicals unit, said in an interview today in
 Kuala Lumpur , where he’s attending an industry conference. “We
expect 2012 to start to show an inflection point.”  The pace of oil and gas awards, which totaled $3.9 billion
during the first quarter, may not be sustained in the full year,
he said. New awards won by Irving, Texas-based Fluor fell to
$8.3 billion in 2011 from $9.7 billion the previous year.  North America, especially  Canada , is set to make the
biggest contribution to growth in the energy unit this year, he
said. Contracts in the first quarter included two refining
projects for  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  in India and oil sands
work in Canada.  Fluor, which had cash, plus securities, of $2.7 billion at
the end of the first quarter, may seek small acquisitions in the
energy business this year, he said.  “You probably won’t see us going on a buying spree like
some of our competitors,” Oosterveer said. “What you could
expect us to do is be selective and do some niche acquisitions
in some places,” including Latin America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
