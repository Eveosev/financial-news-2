Hengdeli Holdings Ltd. (3389) , the retail
partner of  Swatch Group AG (UHR)  in China, climbed in Hong Kong
trading after buying back stock and saying it is confident in
its business prospects.  Hengdeli  climbed  2.4 percent to HK$2.14 at the close of
trading in Hong Kong. The city’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.85
percent.  The company bought 4.1 million shares for HK$8.7 million
($1.1 million) over two days because it has “full confidence”
in its future, Hengdeli said in a press release. The watch
retailer’s stock has lost 16 percent this year, compared with
the Hang Seng’s 1.3 percent gain, amid concerns about a slowdown
in China’s economy.  “It shows that the management still has confidence in the
share price performance and the operations of the whole
company,” said Claudia Ching, a Hong Kong-based analyst with
CCB International Securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
