Turkish benchmark debt  yields  fell in
the longest losing streak since December as the central bank
offered funding at its cheapest rate for a third day. The lira
appreciated for the fifth day.  Yields on benchmark two-year bonds dropped for a sixth day,
retreating four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 9.15
percent at the 5 p.m. close in Istanbul, the lowest level in
three months. Yields retreated 186 basis points this year in the
biggest decline among  emerging markets  after  Brazil .  Inflation in May slowed to 8.3 percent from 11.1 percent in
April, the biggest decrease since January 2003, the statistics
office in Ankara said June 4, prompting the central bank to
provide lending at its lowest 5.75 percent rate. The Ankara-
based bank provided 3 billion liras ($1.6 billion) at one-week
repurchase auctions today.  “We had stated that the bond yields may follow a positive
track if the central bank declares today a normal day,” Ali
Cakiroglu, a strategist at  HSBC Private Bank  in Istanbul, said
in an e-mailed note. “The benchmark bond yields may retreat to
9.0 percent levels.”  The days when the central bank provides funding at its 5.75
percent benchmark interest rates are termed “normal days” and
the days when the bank withholds lending at that rate are termed
“exceptional.”  The lira strengthened 0.5 percent to 1.8199 per dollar in a
fifth day of advances as  China  cut lending and deposit rates for
the first time since 2008 to combat a deepening slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
