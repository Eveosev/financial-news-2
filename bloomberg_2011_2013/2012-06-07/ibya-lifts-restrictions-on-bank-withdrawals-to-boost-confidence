Libya  lifted restrictions on
withdrawing money from banks in a bid to boost confidence even
as the central government struggled to reestablish order months
after the death of  Muammar Qaddafi .  Central Bank Governor Saddek Omar Elkaber said in a
statement in Tripoli today that all indications point “to a
strengthening of confidence in the local banking sector.”  Libya, which sits atop  Africa ’s largest proven crude
reserves, faced a sharp liquidity crunch during the violent
uprising that pushed Qaddafi from power after roughly 42 years -
- a fight that battered its oil sector and sent foreign
investors fleeing.  The Central Bank called on Libyans, businessmen and
companies to “not hesitate” in depositing their money in the
banks to keep it safe and allow its use in “developing the
Libyan economy,” the governor said.  Elkaber said a recently approved Islamic banking law will
go into effect once it’s published in the official newspapers.
The central bank’s deputy governor, Ali Mohamed Salem, said on
May 29 that the law will help attract deposits to Shariah-
complaint lenders outside the banking system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
