Kenya ’s shilling appreciated for a
sixth day, heading for the biggest gain in more than five
months, as the central bank curbed  money supply .  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 1.4 percent to 84.35 per dollar, the biggest one-day
gain since Dec. 16, and was trading 1 percent stronger at 84.70
by 5:19 p.m. in Nairobi, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Kenya accepted 850 million shillings ($10 million) of 2.82
billion shillings of bids received for seven-day repurchase
agreement at a weighted average rate of 17.72 percent, a central
bank official, who declined to be named in line with policy,
said by phone from the capital, Nairobi. The bank accepted all
bids of 3.55 billion shilling for longer-term auction deposits,
at a weighted average rate of 18 percent. The bank had offered 4
billion shillings of the securities, the official said.  “The stepped-up liquidity mopping by the central bank will
keep liquidity tight in the local market, supporting the local
unit,”  Leon Myburgh , a foreign exchange strategist at Citigroup
Inc. based in  South Africa , said in a note to client.  Kenya’s central bank retained its benchmark rate at a
record-high 18 percent in its monetary policy committee meeting
on June 5, holding it for a sixth month.  “Tuesday’s unchanged rate decision has also certainly
contributed to the strengthening of the shilling,” Myburgh
said.  Kenya’s central bank introduced “longer tenor Term Auction
Deposits as an additional instrument for liquidity management,”
it said in in its monetary policy committee statement on June 5.  Loan  Kenya received the first $240 million of a $600 million
syndicated loan agreed upon with three international lenders
last month,  Joseph Kinyua , permanent secretary at the  Finance
Ministry , said in an e-mailed statement on May 5. The remaining
$360 million will be drawn down after one month, he said.  Kenya’s trade deficit widened in March as fuel imports rose
to the highest in seven months, the  Kenya National Bureau of
Statistics  said on May 30 on its website. The gap increased 22
percent from a year earlier to 80.3 billion shillings ($938
million). The  inflation  rate fell to the lowest for more than a
year in May, slowing for a sixth month, to 12.2 percent from
13.1 percent a month earlier, the Nairobi-based Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics said in an e-mailed statement on May 30.  The Ugandan shilling gained 0.3 percent to 2,477.50 per
dollar today, while Tanzania’s shilling gained less than 0.1
percent to 1,588 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
