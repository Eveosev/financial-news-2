Libya ’s Oil Ministry opened a
department in the eastern city of Benghazi as part of the
government’s push to decentralize and improve its
administration, state-owned National Oil Corp. said.  The new office is the first of any ministry to open in
Benghazi since the uprising and conflict that ended the four-
decade rule of former leader  Muammar Qaddafi , the Tripoli-based
company said in a report on its website. Eastern Libya, where
the anti-regime revolt erupted in February 2011, was
marginalized economically and politically under Qaddafi.  Libya holds  Africa ’s largest crude reserves and ranks as
the continent’s third-biggest producer after Nigeria and Angola.
It pumped 1.4 million barrels a day of crude in May, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, as production continues to
recover from the effects of the conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
