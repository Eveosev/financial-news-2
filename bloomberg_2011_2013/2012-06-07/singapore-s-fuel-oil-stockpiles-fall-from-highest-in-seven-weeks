Singapore ’s stockpiles of  fuel oil 
fell from the highest level in seven weeks, according to data
from a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
dropped 3 percent to 19.75 million barrels in the week ended
June 6,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Last week, supplies were at the highest level
since April 11.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline, rose 14 percent to 10.01 million barrels. Middle
distillates, a category that includes gasoil and kerosene,
increased 2.7 percent to 8.97 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
