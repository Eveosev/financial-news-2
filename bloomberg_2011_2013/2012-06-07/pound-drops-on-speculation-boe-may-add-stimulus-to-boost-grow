The pound erased a decline against
the dollar and gilts fell after a report showed U.K. services
grew more than analysts estimated in May, damping speculation
that the  Bank of England  will add stimulus to boost the economy.  Sterling advanced for a fourth day against the yen before
the central bank announces its latest policy decision. Of 42
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, 37 forecast that the Monetary
Policy Committee will keep its bond-purchase target on hold at
325 billion pounds ($503 billion). Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank
AG, and Morgan Stanley are among banks that predict an expansion
of the so-called quantitative-easing program.  “The case for not changing the amount of stimulus has been
reinforced by the resilience in the service sector,” said
 Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce in London. “For now it would make sense for
the BOE to keep their powder dry and wait to see how events
develop over the next month or two. If we see no change, we
might see a little bit of a leap in sterling because some people
are expecting more” asset purchases.  The pound was little changed at $1.5509 as of 11:07 a.m.
 London  time, after falling as much as 0.4 percent. It reached
$1.5269 on June 1, the lowest level since Jan. 13. Sterling
strengthened 0.5 percent to 123.27 yen. Britain’s currency was
little changed at 81.14 pence per euro, after declining 0.3
percent yesterday.  Services Expansion  A gauge based on a survey of  purchasing managers  remained
at 53.3 from April, Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute
of Purchasing and Supply  said in a report today in London. The
median estimate of 27 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a decline to 52.4. A measure above 50 indicates expansion.  Markit’s manufacturing gauge on June 1 fell more than
economists forecast to 45.9, the lowest since May 2009. A
construction index released yesterday slipped to 54.4 from 55.8.  The service sector data “reduces the pressure on the Bank
of England to act,”  Christian Schulz , an economist at Berenberg
Bank in London, wrote in a note.  Policy makers will leave the benchmark  interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009, a
separate survey shows.  The yield on 10-year gilts rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.68 percent. The 4 percent bond due March
2022 fell 0.19, or 1.90 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
120.76. The yield declined to a record 1.439 percent on June 1.  “The addition of stimulus today is a very close call
because the U.K. economy is going through a very weak period,”
said  Gavin Friend , a markets strategist at  National Australia
Bank Ltd. (NAB)  in London. “We don’t think they will add stimulus,
but if they do, the pound would weaken, particularly against the
euro.”  Benchmark Rate  Sterling has declined 1.3 percent in the past month, the
second-biggest drop after  Sweden ’s krona among 10 developed-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The yen rose 4.2 percent, the biggest gain, and the
dollar added 3.6 percent. Sterling is still up 1.6 percent for
the year to date.  “The pound remains under downward pressure,”  Lee Hardman ,
a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in
London, wrote in a client note today. “The sharp turnaround in
the pound’s performance over the past month has coincided with
renewed expectations of further monetary easing from the BOE.”  While the U.K. economy has weakened, the pound has advanced
2.9 percent against the euro in the past three months as
investors seek a haven from the crisis in the 17-nation currency
bloc. It reached 79.51 pence on May 16, the strongest level
since November 2008.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday
that officials stand ready to act as the growth outlook worsens
in the euro area, Britain’s biggest trading partner. While the
ECB left its benchmark rate at 1 percent, Draghi said “a few”
governing council members sought a cut.  Gilts have returned 2.8 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds rose 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
