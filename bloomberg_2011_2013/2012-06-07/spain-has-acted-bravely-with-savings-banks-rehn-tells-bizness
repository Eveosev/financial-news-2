The Spanish government has acted
“bravely” in moving to reform the country’s savings banks,
European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told Latvian newspaper  Dienas Bizness  in an interview.  “The Spanish government has worked very bravely and
determinedly, especially with the reform of the savings banks,”
the Riga-based newspaper quoted Rehn as saying. “Soon they will
complete the first phase of the independent evaluation for all
the bank recapitalization costs,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
