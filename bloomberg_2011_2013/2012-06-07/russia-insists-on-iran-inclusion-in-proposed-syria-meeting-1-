Russia insists that  Iran  must be
invited to a meeting of countries that have influence over
Syria’s opposition groups and government as proposed by Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov.  “We hope this proposal will be examined today by United
Nations and Arab League envoy  Kofi Annan  and the UN secretary
general,” Alexander Lukashevich, a Foreign Ministry spokesman,
said in comments broadcast on state television today. “It is
our firm view that we can’t do without the participation of this
state as well as other countries in the region.”  Russia and China are seeking to press the Syrian opposition
to support peace efforts by Annan. The two nations, along with
the U.S., the U.K., France, the European Union, the Organization
of Islamic Conference and Arab League States,  Turkey  and Iran
should take part in the meeting, Lavrov said in Beijing
yesterday after two days of meetings between Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Chinese leaders including his counterpart, Hu
Jintao.  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  expressed doubt
over the Russian initiative to invite Iran, an ally of Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad.  “It’s a little hard to imagine inviting a country that is
stage-managing the Assad regime’s assault on its people,”
Clinton said yesterday in Baku, Azerbaijan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
