JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Bear Stearns
unit agreed to a proposed $275 million cash settlement of a
consolidated federal lawsuit filed by investors who lost money
from 2006 to 2008.  Under the agreement, which requires approval by a judge,
the money, minus legal fees, will go to  shareholders  who claimed
the company issued “materially false and misleading
statements” about financial results, according to papers filed
yesterday in  Manhattan  federal court. The legal fees requested
haven’t yet been specified.  Company officials “continue to deny any wrongdoing” in
the case, according to a stipulation filed with the court. Among
the defendants are former Bear Stearns executives and directors
including James Cayne,  Alan Schwartz , Warren Spector, Samuel
Molinaro and Alan Greenberg.  Shareholders filed a series of lawsuits against Bear
Stearns beginning in 2008, claiming the company’s statements
artificially inflated its share price, which soared to $159.36
in April 2007, and then fell to $106.55 on Aug. 3, 2007, after
news about “Bear Stearns’ risky  hedge funds ” and negative
rating-agency outlooks. The suit is on behalf of investors who
bought Bear Stearns stock and other equity securities and
options from Dec. 14, 2006 to March 14, 2008.  Stock Fell  Bear Stearns, a New York-based investment bank, announced
in January 2008 that U.S. prosecutors were inquiring into the
collapse of the hedge funds. The stock fell to $78.87, according
to court filings. Other announcements in early 2008 led to
further drops in the stock price. In March JPMorgan Chase
announced it was buying Bear Stearns for $2 a share.  The defendants entered into the settlement “solely to
eliminate the burden, expense, uncertainty and distraction of
further litigation,” the filing states.  Brad Karp , a lawyer for Bear Stearns, declined to comment
on the settlement. Thomas Dubbs, a lawyer for the investors,
didn’t return a message seeking comment.  The lead plaintiff in the case is the State of Michigan
Retirement Systems.  In January 2011 U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet denied a
Bear Stearns motion to dismiss the case. Negotiations on a
settlement with a mediator in 2009 were unsuccessful, according
to court papers. An agreement in principle on this settlement
was reached in May 2012. The case produced more than 9 million
pages of documents, according to the filing.  The case is In re The Bear Stearns Cos. Securities,
Derivative and ERISA Litigation, 08-mdl-1963 and 08-cv-2793,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
