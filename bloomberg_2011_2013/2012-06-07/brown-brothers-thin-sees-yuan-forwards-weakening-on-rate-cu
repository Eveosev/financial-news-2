Win Thin, global head of  emerging
markets  strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York,
comments on  China ’s first interest-rate cut since 2008, in a
note to clients today.  “The fact that PBOC eased policy today ahead of the China
data deluge starting Friday suggests further softness lies
ahead.  ‘‘We warn that PBOC easing is unlikely to be the strong
tonic for risk appetite that it once was. China is easing
aggressively because the fundamental backdrop is deteriorating.  ‘‘We are still calling for basic stability in yuan spot for
now as well as further weakness in one-year non-deliverable
forwards.  ‘‘We do not think China is embarking on a campaign of
significant nominal depreciation now, and expect the recent bout
of depreciation to be limited and even reversed.  ‘‘If we continue to get a steady stream of poor China data,
this should lead to further  yuan  non-deliverable forwards
weakness. While we do not expect greater depreciation, we think
non-deliverable forwards will nevertheless start to price in
more and this would imply greater market pessimism regarding
China growth.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
