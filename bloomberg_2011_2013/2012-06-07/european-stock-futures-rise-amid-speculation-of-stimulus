European stocks  rallied, completing
their biggest two-day gain since November, after China cut
interest rates, adding to speculation that policy makers around
the world will take steps to revive growth.  Rio Tinto  Group and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  led a surge by metal
producers, rising at least 2 percent. Spanish banks also
advanced after the country beat its 2.07 billion-euro target
($2.6 billion) at a bond sale. Vivendi SA jumped 3.7 percent
after the company was said to have decided to discuss whether to
sell its video-game unit at a meeting later this month.  The Stoxx 600 gained 1.1 percent to 242.64 at the close of
trading, extending yesterday’s 2.3 percent advance after the
 European Central Bank  said it will act if necessary as the
outlook for growth deteriorates. The gauge has still fallen  11
percent from its 2012 high .  “We’ve seen the first policy response today,” said Kevin Lilley, a European  fund manager  at Old Mutual Asset Managers
U.K. in London, which has 4 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) in
assets under management. “Economic data has just recently
deteriorated which you could argue is more likely to prompt a
policy response. I think we are now at that stage.”  China cut  interest rates  for the first time since 2008,
increasing its efforts to combat a deepening economic slowdown.
The  one-year deposit rate  will drop to 3.25 percent from 3.5
percent with effect from tomorrow and the  one-year lending rate 
will fall to 6.31 percent from 6.56 percent, the People’s Bank
of China said on its website today.  Banks can also offer a 20 percent discount to the benchmark
lending rate, the PBOC said, widening from a previous 10
percent.  U.K. Bond Buying  In the U.S., Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen 
said late yesterday that stalled improvement in the labor market
and weakening financial conditions may lead the central bank to
boost its record monetary easing.  The Bank of England today left its  asset-purchase program 
on hold as the threat from above-target inflation overrode
policy makers’ concern that the euro area’s debt crisis has
weakened U.K. economic growth.  National benchmark indexes climbed in every western-
European market that opened today except Portugal. Germany’s DAX
rose 0.8 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 1.2 percent.
France’s CAC 40 climbed 0.4 percent. Austria’s market was closed
for a public holiday.  Mining Companies Gain  A gauge of mining companies surged 2.5 percent for the
biggest advance on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  after China’s central bank cuts
its benchmark interest rates. Rio Tinto, the  world’s third-
largest mining company , increased 4 percent to 3,015 pence,
while Anglo American climbed 2 percent to 2,133 pence. Xstrata
Plc gained 3 percent to 966.8 pence.  Santander SA added 1.7 percent to 4.78 euros in Madrid
after Spain’s bond auction helped ease concern about financing
the region’s third-biggest budget deficit.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA)  increased 1.2 percent to 5.10 euros and  Banco de
Sabadell SA (SAB)  rose 1.6 percent to 1.37 euros.  Spain sold its benchmark 10-year bond at a yield of 6.044
percent, the most since Nov. 17 when the yield in the secondary
market reached a euro-era record 6.78 percent. Demand for the
security was 3.29 times the amount sold, higher than at the
previous auction in April.  France also sold as much as 7.84 billion euros in debt, at
the top end of its target, taking advantage of investors’ flight
to safety. The country issued 3.48 billion euros in benchmark
10-year bonds at an average yield of 2.46 percent, lower than
the 2.96 percent in the last auction on May 3.  Vivendi Shares Jump  Vivendi (VIV)  rallied 3.7 percent to 13.59 euros. The French
conglomerate will debate the future of Activision Blizzard Inc.
at a retreat for senior executives starting on June 22,
according to people with knowledge of the matter.  Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Bernard Levy  and Chairman
Jean-Rene Fourtou will lead talks on whether to sell part or all
of the company’s 61 percent stake in Activision, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the meeting is
private. Vivendi has met investors in the last few weeks to
discuss options including the possible spinoff of pay-TV unit
Canal Plus, which is 20 percent owned by Lagardere SCA, said one
person.  Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT)  gained 4.9 percent to 2,304 pence after
the maker of a third of all autocatalysts reported a 74 percent
jump in  full-year profit  to 315.9 million pounds and said it
will pay a  special dividend . Sales, excluding precious metals,
climbed 17 percent to 2.7 billion pounds.  Tullow Oil, Mediobanca  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  advanced 2.1 percent to 1,468 pence after
the oil and gas explorer said it found oil at its Paon-1X
exploration well in the sea near Ivory Coast.  Mediobanca SpA (MB)  rose 3.1 percent to 3.31 euros after La
Repubblica reported that billionaire  Vincent Bollore  may
increase his stake in the Italian investment bank if shareholder
Groupama SA exits.  Swedish companies also advanced today after the market was
closed for a public holiday yesterday. SEB AB climbed 4.8
percent to 41.96 kronor,  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  jumped 4.5 percent to
107.60 kronor and  SSAB AB (SSABA)  rose 4.4 percent to 56.70 kronor.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was 16
percent greater than the average of the last 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
