France ’s  unemployment rate  rose in
the first quarter as companies eliminated jobs in the face of
faltering economic growth, posing a challenge to newly elected
President Francois Hollande.  About 10.0 percent of the population was unemployed, up
from 9.8 in the previous three months, according to
International Labour Organization standards, national statistics
office Insee in Paris said today. Excluding France’s overseas
territories, the rate was 9.6 percent, compared with a median
forecast of 9.5 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of five
economists.  With some of France’s largest companies such as  Air France-
KLM (AF) ,  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  and Carrefour SA looking to reduce
costs, labor unions are pressing Hollande to make good on a
campaign promise to prevent a wave of firings.  Bernard Thibault ,
leader of France’s CGT union, estimated last week that 45,000
French jobs are at risk in the coming months.  “The labor market is still fundamentally very weak,” said
Dominique Barbet, an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris.  French jobless claims rose for a 12th month in April, with
the number of people actively looking for work rising by 4,300
to 2.89 million, the Labor Ministry said on May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
