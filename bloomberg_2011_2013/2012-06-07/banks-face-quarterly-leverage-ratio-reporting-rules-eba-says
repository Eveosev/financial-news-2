European banks may have to report
their debt-to-equity ratio to regulators every quarter from next
year, the  European Banking Authority  said on its website today.  The EBA, set up in 2011 to harmonize banking rules across
 Europe , is seeking banks’ views on measures for reporting
leverage and liquidity as part of the bloc’s implementation of
global capital rules known as Basel III. The  consultation
process  will run until Aug. 27, with final standards to be
decided on before the end of the year.  “As the  leverage ratio  is expected to apply to different
European institutions, which differ in size, nature and
complexity, it is necessary to apply the requirements for more
detailed reporting of the components of the leverage ratio in a
proportionate manner,” the London-based EBA said in the report
published on its website today.  The Basel committee, which brings together banking
regulators from 27 nations including the U.S., U.K. and  China ,
has toughened rules for banks’ capital, leverage and liquidity
following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
and the ensuing financial crisis.  European lenders may face monthly liquidity reporting rules
as part of the regulatory overhaul, the EBA said in a  separate
report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
