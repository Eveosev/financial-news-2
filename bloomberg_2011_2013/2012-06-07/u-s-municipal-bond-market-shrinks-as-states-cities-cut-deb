U.S. states and local governments
kept paying down debt during the first three months of 2012,
contributing to a  bond-market  drought that has helped fuel a
rally in the municipal  securities market .  The Federal Reserve Board today said that state and local
government debt shrank at a 1.8 percent annual rate from January
through March, the fourth quarterly drop in the last 15 months.
That cut the size of the municipal bond market by $11.3 billion
to $3.73 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
