Treasury notes snapped a three-day
losing streak after  Federal Reserve  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the economy is at risk from Europe’s debt crisis, while
refraining from discussing steps the central bank might take to
protect growth.  Treasuries fluctuated earlier, with U.S. 10-year yields
touching the highest in a week after China cut interest rates
for the first time since 2008, stepping up efforts to combat a
deepening economic slowdown. The benchmark note yields may fall
to a record 1.3 percent if the European crisis escalates,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “The market is pushing the Fed to be responsive, but
Bernanke isn’t at the stage where he’s ready to pull the
trigger,” said Aaron Kohli, an  interest-rate  strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in  New York , one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the central bank. “The Treasury market has settled in
around these levels, and is waiting for the data to worsen, or
for something on the policy front to improve, as is the Fed.”  The  10-year note  yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.64 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It rose two basis
points earlier to 1.68 percent, the highest level since May 30,
and dropped as much as four basis points. The 1.75 percent
security maturing in May 2022 gained 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000
face amount, to 101.  Thirty-year bond  yields were little changed at 2.74 percent
after rising four basis points and losing five basis points.  Trading volume declined. About $297 billion of Treasuries
 changed hands  through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer
broker, compared with $341 billion yesterday. The average volume
over the past year was $257 billion  Record Lows  Ten- and 30-year yields reached record lows of 1.4387
percent and 2.5089 percent on June 1 after the Labor Department
reported the economy added 69,000 jobs in May, less than half
the forecast in a Bloomberg survey, and as concern festered the
European crisis might spread. The yields reached 2012 highs in
March, 3.49 percent for long bonds and 2.4 percent for 10-years.  Treasuries have returned 1.7 percent this year, according
to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  “The situation in  Europe  poses significant risks to the
U.S. financial system and economy and must be monitored
closely,” Bernanke said today in testimony to Congress’s Joint
Economic Committee in  Washington . “As always, the Federal
Reserve remains prepared to take action as needed.”  The 58-year-old Fed chairman didn’t call for consideration
of additional stimulus. Policy makers have options for further
easing, he said, while declining to specify them.  ‘Appropriate’ Action  The central bank will decide on “what action is
appropriate or what communications are appropriate” if it first
decides economic growth isn’t strong enough to cut  unemployment ,
Bernanke said in response to a question.  In contrast, Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said yesterday the
economy “remains vulnerable to setbacks” and may warrant more
accommodation.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  opens a two-day policy
meeting on June 19. The central bank has held its benchmark
 interest rate  at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, and
bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of quantitative
easing from 2008 through 2011 to spur growth.  “The preemptive aspect of Fed policy is the casualty, and
that means risk assets have to do even worse for the Fed to come
in,” said Dominic Konstam, global head of interest rates
research in New York at the primary dealer Deutsche Bank AG.
“There were a lot of people who thought Bernanke would be
definitive on additional stimulus measures. The speech was a
little tame in that context.”  Fed Sale  The Fed sold $8.4 billion today of Treasuries due from
December 2013 to February 2014 as part of its Operation Twist
program. The central bank is replacing $400 billion of shorter-
term Treasuries in its holdings with longer maturities by the
end of this month to keeping borrowing costs down.  Yields indicate investors expect inflation to hold in check
in the U.S., providing Bernanke the room for further stimulus.  The  difference  in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, which represents traders’
expectations for inflation over the life of the debt, was 2.14
percentage points today, down from this year’s high of 2.45
percentage points in March. The average over the past decade is
2.15 percentage points.  Expensive Securities  Valuation measures showed Treasuries are at almost the most
expensive level ever. The term premium, a model created by
economists at the Fed, was at negative 0.83 percent after
closing on June 1 at negative 0.94 percent, the record. The
average over the past year is negative 0.44. A negative reading
indicates investors are willing to accept yields below what’s
considered fair value.  The yield difference between 10- and 30-year Treasuries
widened to 110 basis points, from 108 yesterday. It reached 122
basis points on Feb. 3, the widest this year.  Spain ’s credit grade was lowered by  Fitch Ratings  to BBB,
from A. The firm said the country, the euro bloc’s fourth-
largest economy, will stay in recession through the remainder of
this year and 2013. Spanish borrowing costs climbed earlier
above 6 percent at a 10-year bond sale amid concern Europe’s
leaders are failing to contain the region’s debt crisis.  Treasury “10-year notes have been very highly correlated
with the yield spreads of Spain, Italy and  France ,” Terry Belton, the JPMorgan’s global head of fixed-income and foreign-
exchange research, said in a radio interview on Bloomberg
Surveillance with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. If those markets
stay “under stress, it’s easy for 10-year notes to go as low as
1.4 percent or even 1.3 percent.”  Treasury Auctions  The Treasury said it will auction $66 billion in notes and
bonds next week: $32 billion of three-year debt, $21 billion of
10-year securities and $13 billion of the 30-year bonds.  U.S. government securities were little changed earlier
today as data showed fewer Americans applied for unemployment
insurance payments last week, indicating limited progress in the
labor market after a two-month slowdown in hiring.  First-time claims for  jobless benefits  fell by 12,000 to
377,000 in the week ended June 2 from a revised 389,000 the
prior week that was higher than initially estimated, the Labor
Department said. The median estimate of 49 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for 378,000 claims.  China ’s benchmark one-year lending rate will drop to 6.31
percent from 6.56 percent effective tomorrow, the People’s Bank
of China said on its website today. The one-year deposit rate
will fall to 3.25 percent from 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
