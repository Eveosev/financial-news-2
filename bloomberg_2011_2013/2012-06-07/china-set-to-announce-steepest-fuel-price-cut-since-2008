China , the world’s second-biggest oil
user, may reduce gasoline and diesel prices by the most since at
least 2008 after a slump in global crude costs.  State-controlled fuel prices will be cut starting tomorrow,
C1 Energy, a Shanghai-based commodity researcher that has
correctly reported the timing and size of changes before
official announcements, said on its website today. C1 cited
“two big companies” that it didn’t identify. Prices may drop
by as much as  620 yuan  ($97) a metric ton, equivalent to 28
cents a gallon, under government rules, it said.  A cut in fuel prices threatens to reduce revenue at  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  and  PetroChina Co. (857) , the nation’s
biggest refiners, offsetting cheaper crude costs and extending
processing losses that widened last quarter. Brent oil in
London, a benchmark grade tracked by China’s government, entered
a so-called  bear market  on June 1 after sliding more than 20
percent from this year’s high.  A reduction by 620  yuan  a ton would be the steepest since
the current pricing system was introduced in December 2008. It
is equivalent to 6.4 percent decrease in nationwide average
retail gasoline prices published by the government, according to
Bloomberg calculations. The size of the cut is still to be
determined and it may be less than 600 yuan, C1 said.  The current maximum at which 90-RON, Euro III-equivalent
gasoline can be sold to motorists in Beijing is 10,050 yuan a
ton, or $4.51 a gallon.  Processing Losses  The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top
economic planner, considers adjusting fuel rates when the 22-day
moving average of Brent, Dubai and  Indonesia ’s Cinta crude
changes more than 4 percent from the previous revision. Today is
the 22nd working day after the last adjustment on May 10, the
official Xinhua News Agency said June 6. Costs at the pump are
“almost certain” to be adjusted, it said.  The government may implement a 10 percent reduction to fuel
prices this weekend,  Gordon Kwan , the regional head of energy
research at Mirae Asset Securities  Hong Kong  Ltd., said in an e-
mailed note yesterday.  China Petroleum, or Sinopec, had a 16-fold increase in its
first-quarter refining loss to 9.2 billion yuan compared with a
year earlier, the company said April 26. PetroChina said its
operating loss from processing widened to 10.4 billion yuan in
the three months from 6.1 billion yuan a year earlier.  Sinopec rose 1.1 percent to HK$7.10 at the midday lunch
break in Hong Kong, while PetroChina gained 0.8 percent to
HK$10.12. The benchmark  Hang Seng  index fell 0.4 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
