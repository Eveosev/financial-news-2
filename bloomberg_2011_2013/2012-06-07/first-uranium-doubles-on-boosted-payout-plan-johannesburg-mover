     June 7 (Bloomberg) -- First Uranium Corp. (FUM)  climbed the most
in more than five years as the uranium and gold producer said it
would give $50.2 million to shareholders after selling assets to
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Gold One International Ltd. (GDO)   First Uranium shares more than doubled to 1.43 rand by 1:15
p.m. in Johannesburg, the biggest increase since it listed on
the city’s stock exchange in 2007. A close at that level would
be the highest since Feb. 24.  The company raised the amount it expects to distribute to
shareholders once it sells its Mine Waste Solutions business to
AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and its Ezulwini Gold Mine to Gold One
International Ltd. from the $36.6 million proposed on March 2
when it announced the deals. Holders of the company’s notes will
get $154.9 million, down from $167.7 million, while debenture
holders will get $140.7 million, from $147.7 million.  A group of shareholders was opposed to the previous plan
and investors may be “hoping that this increase in the
distribution will get the support of those shareholders,”
Edward Sterck, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said by phone
from  London . “They’ve increased the distribution to normal
shareholders by trimming the proposed returns to debt holders
and they still require the approval from those debt holders for
the transaction to go ahead.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
