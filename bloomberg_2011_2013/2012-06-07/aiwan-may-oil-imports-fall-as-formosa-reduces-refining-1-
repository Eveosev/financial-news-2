Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude oil needs, purchased less of the fuel in
May as  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  reduced refining.  Shipments declined 7.4 percent from a year earlier to 22.5
million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  in Taipei
said in a statement today. The island’s May oil bill declined
6.2 percent to $2.69 billion, it said.  Crude oil processed in May at Formosa Petrochemical, the
smaller of Taiwan’s two refiners, was on average 61,000 barrels
a day less than a year earlier, the company said in a June 4
statement to the Taiwan stock exchange. The refiner halted a
distillation unit for maintenance in May, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
