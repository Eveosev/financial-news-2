Municipal-bond insurance may return
to cover 20 percent or more of the debt sold by U.S. state and
local governments, said Eric Friedland, head of municipal-credit
research at Schroder Investment Management North America.  “There is a need for some level of bond insurance,
especially for the retail investors,” Friedland said at the
State and Municipal Finance Conference hosted by  Bloomberg Link 
in Chicago. “Penetration won’t be 50 percent,” he said, though
it could reach the “teens or low 20s.”  With more than 50 percent of bonds insured in the municipal
market, most credits were given top grades from rating agencies.
That lowered borrowing costs for state and local governments.
About 4 percent of debt sold this year through May was insured,
according to a report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Analysts at the bond-insurance companies also provided
legal protection for bondholders through stronger covenants and
larger reserve funds, said Friedland, whose  New York  subsidiary
of London’s  Schroders Plc. (SDR) , manages about $2 billion in
municipal bonds.  “When bond insurance was more prevalent, the structures
were a lot stronger,” Friedland said. “I’ve definitely
observed, being on the buy side now, legal provisions getting
somewhat weaker.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
