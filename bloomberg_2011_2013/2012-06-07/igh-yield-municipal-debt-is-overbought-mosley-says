High-yield bonds issued by state and
local governments, the best performers in the $3.7 trillion
municipal market, are getting too expensive, said Bart Mosley,
co-president of Trident Municipal Research.  “The high-yield part of the market is approaching
overbought, if it’s not already there,” Mosley said at the
State and Municipal Finance Conference hosted by  Bloomberg Link 
in  Chicago . “There’s more risk to underperformance now than
there is opportunity for continuing to outperform.”  High-yield municipal bonds are debt typically rated below
investment grade. They have returned about 9.4 percent this
year, the most of any area in the market, according to Standard
& Poor’s indexes. The overall market has gained about 3.8
percent, the index data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
