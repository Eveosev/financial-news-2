Japanese  stocks  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
Index capping the biggest three-day advance since March 2011,
amid speculation policy makers in the U.S., China and Europe
will take action to spur growth amid a deepening debt crisis.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
rose 2 percent after the yen weakened, lifting overseas earnings
prospects.  Inpex Corp. (1662) , the nation’s top energy explorer,
advanced 3.3 percent as oil climbed for a fourth day. Ricoh Co.

raised to “buy” at Deutsche Bank AG.  The Topix gained 1.7 percent to 730.75 at the 3 p.m. close
of trading in Tokyo, with 32 of its 33 industry groups climbing.

11 stocks gained for each that slid on the gauge. Equities
advanced ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s
testimony later today on the economic outlook to the U.S.
Congress.  “Investors have enough reasons to believe that policy
makers will act,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
almost $100 billion under management. “U.S. officials sound a
bit more dovish lately, and similarly in  China . China may be
getting close to easing. All of those things have led to a
degree of confidence.”  The Topix is poised for its first weekly advance in 10
weeks on speculation stocks are oversold after the measure on
June 4 closed at its lowest level since 1983. Short selling in
Japan made up 27 percent of the total value of shares traded
yesterday, down from 32 percent on May 30, according to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Cheap Valuations  The Topix fell 16 percent from this year’s high on March 27,
erasing 50 trillion yen ($630 billion) in market value, amid
concern the European crisis is deepening and as growth in China
slows. Stocks on the measure are valued at 0.86 times book value,
about the same level as in October 2008 amid the global
financial crisis.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.1
percent today after the index rallied 2.3 percent yesterday for
its biggest gain this year.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi yesterday said
policy makers are ready to add more stimulus if needed, while
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the U.S. economy
“remains vulnerable” and may warrant additional easing.
Premier  Wen Jiabao  vowed last month to focus more on increasing
growth in China, with the government saying yesterday it will
delay tighter bank capital requirements to ensure lending
support to bolster the economy.  Sony, Honda  Electronics companies, carmakers and banks accounted for
about 45 percent of the Topix’s rally today amid reduced concern
the European debt crisis will derail the global economy. Sony
gained 2 percent to 1,072 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker by market value, rose 2.1 percent to 2,537 yen.

advanced 2.9 percent to 355 yen.  Trading volume on the Nikkei was about the same as the 30-
day average ahead of a quarterly settlement of futures and
options contracts tomorrow, known as the major “special
quotation.” The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  slid 4.2 percent to
25.50, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Energy shares rallied after crude for July delivery rose as
much as 73 cents to $85.75 a barrel in electronic trading on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange. Inpex climbed 3.3 percent to
454,000 yen, while  Japan  Petroleum Exploration Co. rose 1.8
percent to 3,075 yen.  Ricoh advanced 4.1 percent to 591 yen after its investment
