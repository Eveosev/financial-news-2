Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) ,  Colombia ’s largest
bank by market capitalization, is prepared to adjust its
strategy if the government introduces more measures to curb
credit growth, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Yepes said.  Colombia moved to slow the pace of consumer credit growth
last month by increasing provision requirements for lenders that
have seen a rise in bad loans. Consumer lending grew 22 percent
in March, according to the central bank. Credit measures are
already slowing consumer loan growth, Yepes said in an interview
in Cartagena.  “We have to wait and see, there may be other” measures,
Yepes said.  Bancolombia said May 28 its board approved a plan to sell 3
trillion pesos ($1.7 billion) of peso-denominated debt. The
bonds can be sold in Colombia in one or several offerings, the
bank said.  “There are a lot of opportunities and this economy is
growing,” said Yepes. “We’re not buying anything right now. If
we issue bonds it’s to fund growth in lending.”  Bancolombia is not interested in buying  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ’s pension assets, Yepes said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
