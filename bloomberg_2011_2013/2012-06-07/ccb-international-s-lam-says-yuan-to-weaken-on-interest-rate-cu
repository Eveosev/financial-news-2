Banny Lam, a Hong Kong-based
economist at CCB International Securities Ltd., comments on
China’s decision to cut interest rates for the first time since
2008.  “The  yuan  will trade weaker against the dollar in a
month’s time as investors take today’s interest rate cut as a
signal that upcoming economic data will be bad. They are also
expecting more rate cuts to come.  ‘‘I expect the yuan to appreciate 1 percent at most this
year, and the worst case is no appreciation.  ‘‘China is likely to reduce interest rates one more time
and have another required-reserves ratio cut this year. Either
of them should happen within two months.  ‘‘Yuan gains will resume momentum when investors see
 China’s economy  is growing again with stimulus taking effect.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
