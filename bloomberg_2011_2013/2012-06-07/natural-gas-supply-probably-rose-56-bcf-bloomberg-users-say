The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 2 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s report will show that inventories gained
56 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 1 to 2.871 trillion
cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for July delivery fell 2.4 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.397 per million British thermal units on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 10:22 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
