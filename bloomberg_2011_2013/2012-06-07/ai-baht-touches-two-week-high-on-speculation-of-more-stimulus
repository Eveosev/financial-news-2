Thailand’s baht reached a two-week
high and  government bonds  rose as optimism policy makers will be
able to spur global growth boosted demand for higher-yielding
assets.  The  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia-Pacific Index of shares climbed after Federal
Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said the U.S. economy may
warrant additional monetary stimulus and European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said the authority stands ready to act if
the region’s debt crisis damps the euro-area economy further.
Government bonds rose after Thai Bond Market Association data
showed global investors  bought  $327 million more local
government debt than they sold this week through yesterday.  “Policy makers noticed the situation is critical and may
take some action,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the
Asian and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
 Tokyo . “That has improved sentiment toward emerging-market
assets for now.”  The baht traded little changed at 31.50 per dollar as of
4:02 p.m. in Bangkok after touching 31.37 earlier, the strongest
level since May 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.44
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
