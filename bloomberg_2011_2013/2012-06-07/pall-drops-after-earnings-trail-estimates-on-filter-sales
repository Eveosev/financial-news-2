Pall Corp. (PLL)  fell the most in nine
months after the maker of filtration and separation products
posted third-quarter earnings that lagged analysts’ estimates.  Pall dropped 4.3 percent to $52.29 at the close in  New
York , the biggest decline since Sept. 8.  Profit in the three months ended April 30 was 70 cents,
excluding restructuring costs and some tax items,  Port
Washington , New York-based Pall said yesterday in a statement.
The average  estimate  of 10 analysts compiled by Bloomberg was 76
cents.  Revenue in the life-sciences unit was “surprisingly
weak,” particularly for products used to make biological drugs,
Jon Wood, a New York-based analyst at Jefferies & Co., said
today in a report. Lower demand for some industrial products
“is highly concerning,” said Wood, who rates the shares hold.  Sales in the year starting Aug. 1 will rise by a “low
single-digit” percentage, Pall said in the statement. The
average estimate of 9 analysts compiled by Bloomberg was for
sales to rise 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
