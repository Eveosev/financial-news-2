Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest
importer of liquefied natural gas, said U.S. policies will
determine how much LNG the country exports and shipments will
undermine a 40-year-old oil-linked price mechanism used in Asia.  “There is good potential for the U.S and  Canada  to export
LNG to Asia,” Chief Executive Officer Choo Kang-Soo said in an
interview today in Kuala Lumpur, where he is attending an
industry conference. “How much they can ship out will depend on
the policy of the U.S. and also what American people think.”  Asia’s LNG buyers, which account for more than 60 percent
of global demand, are turning to  North America  because U.S.
prices are tumbling amid record production driven by extraction
from shale deposits. That’s weakening the so-called Japan Crude
Cocktail, the benchmark index used to price long-term contracts
across Asia.  “More volumes from the U.S. will affect oil-linked gas
pricing,” Choo of Korea Gas said today. Western Canada is also
preparing to export LNG, so “we have to see the overall
picture,” he said.  Qatar, the world’s largest LNG provider, and Australian
producers including  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  this week played
down prospects of large-scale exports from the U.S., where a
shale-gas boom has upended global energy markets and brought the
country closer to energy independence.  Woodside, operator of the A$15 billion Pluto LNG project in
Western Australia, expects the U.S. to export as much as 50
million metric tons of the fuel by 2025. That would meet about
10 percent of global demand. The company last month predicted 65
million to 80 million tons of unmet demand in 2018 to 2020.  Cheniere Energy  South Korea has agreed to buy 3.5 million metric tons of
LNG annually from the U.S. starting 2017, Choo said.  Asian buyers including Korea Gas and  GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL)  have
contracted about 7 million tons of U.S. supplies since last year
from Cheniere Energy Inc., the Houston-based company developing
what will be the nation’s largest LNG export terminal in
Louisiana.  Tokyo Gas Co. (9531) , Japan’s biggest gas distributor, and
 Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  agreed in April to buy 2.3 million tons annually
for 20 years from  Dominion Resources Inc. (D) ’s Cove Point project.  Buying U.S. gas will allow Asian consumers to pay prices
linked to U.S. Henry Hub futures, which dropped 32 percent in
2011 and are down 19 percent in 2012. Futures slumped to $1.90
per million Btu on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange April 19,
the lowest since September 2001. The contract rose 0.4 percent
today to $2.43 per million Btu.  “We are studying and recalculating the LNG import plan for
future as the whole economy has been changed,” Choo said. “The
result may come out at the end of the year.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
