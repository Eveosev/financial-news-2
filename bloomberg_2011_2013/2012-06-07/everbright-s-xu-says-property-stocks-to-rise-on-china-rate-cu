Xu Gao, chief economist at Everbright
Securities Co., comments on China’s decision to cut  interest
rates  for the first time since 2008.  “The abrupt rate cut, out of most people’s expectations,
should be good news to the market and should give a boost to
stocks in all sectors, particularly the cyclical ones and also
including property stocks, though the narrower interest margin
won’t be a good thing to banks.”  “It’s a strong signal on easing, which is far more
significant than cutting reserve ratios.”  “The move indicates data in May may have remained weak,
even though it may not necessarily have deteriorated from
April.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
