Pakistan ’s top judge has withdrawn
from the Supreme Court bench hearing allegations that his son
received money from a property developer in a bid influence the
outcome of cases against the businessman, the Geo television
channel reported, citing court proceedings.  Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry summoned his son
after reports he was given as much as $4 million and foreign
trips by the real-estate tycoon, Malik Riaz Hussain, according
to a court statement yesterday. The attorney general, Irfan
Qadir, had objected to Chaudhry’s presence on the panel of
judges hearing the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
