OAO RusHydro and OAO Inter RAO UES
rose after  Russia ’s Economy Minister said the state will sell
its entire stake in the power utilities by 2016.  RusHydro added 4.6 percent to 84.89 kopeks, the highest
intraday level since May 22, as of 4:42 p.m. in Moscow. Inter
RAO climbed 1.7 percent to 2.7 kopeks.  “Private ownership frequently proves itself more
effective, this can be traced to the Russian power sector as a
whole,” Dmitry Bulgakov, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in Moscow,
said by phone. “It creates more incentives for value creation
and cost-cutting.”  The government also plans to reduce its stake in Federal
Grid Co., Russia’s monopoly for high-voltage power transmission
lines, to 75 percent and one share by 2016. Federal Grid traded
up 1.4 percent at 19.23 kopeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
