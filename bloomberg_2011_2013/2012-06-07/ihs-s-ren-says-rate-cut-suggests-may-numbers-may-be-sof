Ren Xianfang, a Beijing-based
economist with IHS Global Insight Ltd. comments by phone on
 China ’s decision to cut  interest rates  for the first time since
2008.  “Possibly because the May numbers are still very soft, the
government wants to take some pre-emptive moves before the
numbers are released. This will help boost sentiments
definitely.”  “They still have concerns about inflation and property
bubbles, but I think the larger concern has become stability of
growth. If you don’t have overall macroeconomic stability, there
is no point for you to try and control the housing market
bubbles. So providing stimulus is for that purpose as I think
stability is paramount now.”  “This was in-line with the broad policy steps they have
been taking even with the fiscal stimulus. The government this
time around is looking at both a short term boost and longer
term structural adjustment. This is just the same as the
structural stimulus that they have recently unveiled.”  “Interest rate liberalization has been a topic that they
have been discussing for such a long time and they want to
incorporate that into this latest package as well, so that they
are not just looking at short term stimuli but also longer term.
That will give the banks more flexibility and I think that will
not just help to improve efficiency, but also alleviate some of
the short-term liquidity crunches which businesses experienced
last year.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
