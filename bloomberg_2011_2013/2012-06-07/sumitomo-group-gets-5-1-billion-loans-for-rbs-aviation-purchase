Three Sumitomo group companies agreed
to borrow $5.06 billion for their $7.3 billion purchase of  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ’s aviation division.  State-run Japan Bank for International Cooperation will
offer $3 billion in loans to RBS Aerospace Ltd., whose name will
be changed this month to SMBC Aviation Capital Ltd., the lender
said in a statement on its website. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. will offer the remaining $2.06 billion for part of the
acquisition, which was completed last week, JBIC said.  The takeover was part of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) ’s efforts to increase overseas assets to counter slowing
credit demand at home. For the loan, JBIC tapped a fund of more
than $100 billion aimed at helping Japanese companies take
advantage of the yen’s appreciation to step up buyouts abroad.  Sumitomo Mitsui Finance & Leasing Co. owns a 30 percent
stake in SMBC Aviation Capital, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial’s
banking unit holds 30 percent, and the remainder is held by
 Sumitomo Corp. (8053) , a trading company, the bank said this week. SMBC
Aviation wants to increase its share of the aircraft leasing
market in  Asia , where the number of passengers is set to grow,
SMBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
