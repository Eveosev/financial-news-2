Ethanol futures advanced in  Chicago 
on concern that interest rate cuts in  China  will boost demand
for commodities such as corn.  The biofuel gained 1 percent after the People’s Bank of
China said the one-year lending rate will drop a quarter-
percentage point to 6.31 percent starting tomorrow, stoking
speculation that the country will boost corn imports. The grain
is the primary ingredient in ethanol in the U.S.  “That pushed corn higher and corn pulled ethanol up,”
said John Janney, a vice president at Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery advanced 2.1 cents to
settle at $2.073 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest level since May 25. Prices have fallen 5.9 percent this
year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 3 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $2.10 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
increased 2 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.03, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 2 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.095 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slid 0.5 cent
to $2.21.  Corn for July delivery rose 7.75 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$5.94 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
