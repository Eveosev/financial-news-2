Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said the U.S. won’t renounce the use of force against people it
classifies as terrorists, after criticism of the military’s use
of drones for attacks in Pakistan and other countries.  The U.S. “can and must do a better job of addressing the
mistaken belief that we use our power casually,” Clinton said
at a conference on counter-terrorism in Istanbul today. When it
does use force against enemies, “we will comply with all
applicable law, including the laws of war, and go to
extraordinary lengths to ensure precision and avoid the loss of
innocent life.”  U.S. officials said a drone strike in Pakistan this week
killed Abu Yahya al-Libi, the second-in-command of al-Qaeda.
Such attacks by unmanned aircraft have frequently caused
civilian casualties, straining ties with  Pakistan , which says
they are illegal, and sparking a debate in Washington.  The 30-member Counterterrorism Forum that meets in Istanbul
today was founded by Clinton and Turkish Foreign Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  in 2011.  Clinton said the group is working on ways to counter
extremist ideologies, adding that the  United Arab Emirates  will
this year open the first international center devoted to the
study of best practices in that field. She said the forum is
also working on recommendations for the rehabilitation of
violent extremists in prison systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
