The International Swaps & Derivatives
Association said it will partner with Markit Group Ltd. to
develop a system enabling counterparties to amend over-the-
counter derivatives documentation in order to help compliance
with Dodd-Frank regulations.  ISDA  said in a statement today that it expects the system,
described as a “technology-based solution,” to be expanded to
work with regulations in other jurisdictions.  The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act is the most sweeping overhaul of
financial rules in the U.S. since the 1930s and, like
regulations elsewhere in the world, is an attempt to prevent a
repeat of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  Some dealers in the OTC derivatives market work with more
than 10,000 counterparties on transactions, which “creates
significant levels of legal and administrative complexity and
the potential for duplication of efforts as firms attempt to
comply with the new rules,” ISDA said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
