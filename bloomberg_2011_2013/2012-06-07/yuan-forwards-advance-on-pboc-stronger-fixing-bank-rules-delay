Yuan forwards strengthened for a
second day as the central bank lifted the daily fixing after a
delay in tightening capital-adequacy rules for banks.  China  plans to introduce the new requirements for lenders
at the beginning of next year, having said in August they would
start being applied from Jan. 1, 2012. The People’s Bank of
China raised the reference rate 0.14 percent, the most since May
21, to 6.3170 per dollar today. The  Dollar Index  weakened 0.6
percent yesterday as Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President
 Dennis Lockhart  said more stimulus should be considered if it
becomes clear U.S. growth is slowing.  “China is showing its determination to support growth as
it ensures there’s bank capital to support lending demand,”
said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB. That’s positive for the  yuan , he said.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.07 percent
to 6.4145 per dollar as of 4:33 p.m. in Hong Kong, a 0.8 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  China’s currency was unchanged at 6.3635 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The central bank’s reference rate was set 0.7 percent stronger
than yesterday’s closing spot price. The currency is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent either side of the daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan climbed 0.03
percent to 6.3620. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
2.15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
