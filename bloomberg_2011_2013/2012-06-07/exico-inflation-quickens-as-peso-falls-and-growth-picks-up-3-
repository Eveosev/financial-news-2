Mexico ’s  inflation rate  rose for the
first time in four months in May as the economy picked up and
the peso weakened, cementing expectations that policy makers
will refrain from cutting  interest rates .  Inflation accelerated to 3.85 percent from 3.41 percent the
month before, the biggest pick-up since January 2010, the
national statistics institute said on its  website  today. In the
month, prices dropped 0.32 percent due to seasonal electricity
subsidies. The median forecast of 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for prices to rise 3.8 percent in the year.  The peso depreciated 9.5 percent in May, the worst
performance of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
pressuring the cost of imports. Inflation accelerated after the
biggest drop in prices in 42 years in May 2011 fell out of the
annual calculation, while the economy grew at the fastest pace
in six quarters in the first three months of the year, fueling
demand.  “There is evidence of moderate pass-through to domestic
prices from a weaker peso and budding mild pressures on
services,”  Alberto Ramos , a senior Latin America economist at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a report today. “There is no
strong evidence of either demand-pull or labor market-driven
cost-push pressures on inflation.”  Yields on inflation-linked bonds due in 2013, known as
Udibonos, declined 7 basis points, or 0.70 percentage point, to
0.299 percent at 10:00 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Core Inflation  Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, accelerated
to 3.48 percent, the fastest pace since December 2010.  Economists expect the central bank to keep the overnight
lending rate at a record low of 4.5 percent this year, according
to a June 4 Banamex survey of analysts. The poll estimated
inflation in the next 12 months at 3.92 percent, up from 3.87
percent in the previous bi-weekly survey.  The target range for inflation is 3 percent, plus or minus
one percentage point.  “There’ll be a kind of hump in inflation in the coming
months,” Sergio Luna, chief economist at  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s
Banamex unit in Mexico City said before the report. “We’ll be
alert to pass-through from the peso to local prices, although
this has been much more limited than in the past.”  Mexicans paid 0.42 percent more for food, beverages and
tobacco than the previous month and 2.14 percent more for fruits
and vegetables, the statistics agency said. Electricity prices
fell 19.31 percent over the same period.  Peso Reaction  The peso strengthened 0.72 percent against the dollar to
13.9245 from 14.0255 yesterday at 10:06 a.m. in Mexico City.  The currency has depreciated in the past month as a
deepening  European debt crisis  causes investors to avoid all but
the safest currencies.  The peso will appreciate once volatility subsides in global
financial markets, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said June
5. Inflation expectations are “well-anchored,” he said.  Mexico’s economy grew 4.6 percent in the first quarter, the
fastest pace since 2010. Analysts raised their estimate for
economic growth this year for a fifth consecutive month in a
June 1 central bank survey. Gross domestic product will expand
3.72 percent, the poll showed, up from 3.62 percent in the
previous survey.  The central bank announces its next interest rate decision
on June 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
