Cameroon’s government will allow
 Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM)  to build a factory in the port city of Douala
after a dispute over land was resolved, a state official said.  A ban on use of the land was lifted on May 28 and the
Nigerian company was granted a construction permit on June 4,
Government Delegate to the Douala City Council Fritz Ntone Ntone
said in a statement handed to reporters yesterday in Yaounde,
the capital. Work has already begun on the site and the project
is expected to be completed within 18 months, he said.  Cameroon’s government and Dangote signed an agreement last
year allowing the company to build a 55 billion-CFA franc ($111
million) cement plant in Douala. The company had previously been
blocked from using the land because it belonged to a
municipality and local ethnic groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
