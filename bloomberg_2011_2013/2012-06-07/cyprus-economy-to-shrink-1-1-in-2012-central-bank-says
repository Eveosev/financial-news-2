Cyprus’s economy, the euro area’s
third smallest, may shrink as much as 1.1 percent this year and
grow 0.4 percent in 2013, the  Central Bank of Cyprus  said.  “Uncertainty in relation to probable fiscal consolidation
measures, the prospect of resorting to the rescue mechanism, the
decline of corporate profitability and of real private
disposable income and the increase of unemployment have
contributed to a negative climate” affecting economic growth,
the Nicosia-based central bank said in a  statement  on its
website today.  The downside risks to growth of the Cypriot economy also
include “the probability of an escalation of the political and
financial turbulence in  Greece  following the June 17 elections”
and further fiscal consolidation measures, according to the
bank.  If additional government budget cuts and a probable resort
to  Europe ’s rescue mechanism are done correctly, “the
improvement in the credibility of the Republic of Cyprus may
probably help overturn the economic climate, at least in the
medium term with positive effects” on growth, the bank said.  The combined economy of the euro region may contract as
much as 0.5 percent or grow as much as 0.3 percent this year,
according to the central bank. Next year, the 17-nation currency
bloc’s gross domestic product may grow as much as 2 percent, the
bank said.  Cyprus’s unemployment rate will reach 10.1 percent this
year and 10.8 percent in 2013, and the inflation rate will be
3.2 percent and 1.3 percent respectively according to
standardized European methodology, the central bank said in a
separate e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
