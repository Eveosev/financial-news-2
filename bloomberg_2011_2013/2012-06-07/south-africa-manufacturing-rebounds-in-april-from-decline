South African  manufacturing 
production increased 1.2 percent in April from a year earlier,
rebounding from a contraction in the previous month, the
statistics office said.  Factory output rose after shrinking a revised 2.9 percent
in March, Pretoria-based Statistics  South Africa  said on its
website today. The  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 11
economists was for growth of 0.9 percent. Production expanded
1.3 percent in the month and 0.4 percent in the three months
through April from the previous period.  The rebound in manufacturing may be short-lived, with
business confidence declining the most since 2008 in the second
quarter, Rand Merchant Bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
The industry makes up 15 percent of the economy and production
is being undermined by the debt crisis in  Europe , which buys
about a third of South Africa’s manufactured exports.  The data “will reinforce the fact that it isn’t just
sentiment, economic data has already been impacted,”  Razia Khan , head of Africa research at Standard Chartered Plc in
 London , said in an e-mailed note to clients.  South Africa’s Reserve Bank kept its  benchmark interest
rate  at 5.5 percent for a record 18 months to help stimulate the
economy, which the bank forecasts will expand 2.9 percent this
year.  The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry said
today its business confidence index declined to 92.8 in May, the
lowest level in more than nine years, as the economic recovery
weakened. The RMB/BER confidence index dropped 11 points to 41
in the second quarter, according to Rand Merchant Bank, a unit
of Johannesburg-based  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)   The rand rose 0.6 percent to 8.2607 a dollar at 2:17 p.m.
in Johannesburg. The yield on the rand bond due in 2015 fell 3
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
