Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. central bank is willing to work with
Congress on a bill that would remove bank executives from the
boards of regional Fed banks.  “If Congress wants to change it, of course we will” work
with lawmakers, Bernanke said today in response to a question
from Senator  Bernie Sanders , an Independent from Vermont, during
an appearance at the Joint Economic Committee. “Congress set
this up,” and “we’ve made it into something useful and
valuable.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s $2 billion trading loss has revived
concern that its principal regulator, the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, is too cozy with Wall Street as JPMorgan Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon serves on the New York Fed’s
board. Bankers play no role in supervision.  Sanders, along with Democratic Senators  Barbara Boxer  of
California and Mark Begich of Alaska, have introduced
legislation that would remove banking industry executives from
the 12 regional Fed banks’ boards of directors. Congress created
the Fed nearly a century ago with a mix of public and private
features, including putting bankers on the boards.  Bernanke said the Fed’s activities have been examined
carefully in the aftermath of the credit crisis, including by
the Government Accountability Office.  “There were no actual conflicts of interest” found, he
said. The Fed has “a firewall so that the bankers do not have
any information or ability to influence supervisory decisions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
