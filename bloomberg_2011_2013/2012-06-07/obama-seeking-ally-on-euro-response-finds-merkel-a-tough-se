President  Barack Obama  has spent much
of his term trying to get Chancellor  Angela Merkel  in his
corner, only to find the German leader won’t easily bend to U.S.
will.  Five months before the presidential election, the stakes
are rising. Obama, in advance of a G-20 summit and European
Union crisis meetings, is urging Merkel to take actions aimed at
forestalling a euro region financial meltdown that would
threaten the U.S. -- and his campaign.  “If Europe implodes, Obama probably won’t be re-elected,”
 Gary Smith , executive director of the  American Academy , a
research group in Berlin that promotes trans-Atlantic ties, said
in an interview. Yet helping any U.S. president right now
“wouldn’t be on Merkel’s radar screen. The divisions about what
needs to be done are so fundamental and public.”  Illustrating the concern, Obama discussed the crisis in
separate phone calls with Merkel and Italian Prime Minister
 Mario Monti  on June 6. They agreed that it’s important “to
strengthen the resilience of the euro zone and growth in Europe
and globally,” the White House said in a statement.  Obama has joined European leaders who chafe at Merkel’s
prescription of budget austerity. While Germany may back
expanding EU job-creation projects, Merkel balks at proposals
for greater deficit spending or underwriting the entire currency
union’s debt with joint bonds, even as the turmoil risks driving
Greece out of the euro and Spain to seek aid for its banks.  U.S. Vulnerability  The U.S. may be more vulnerable than Germany, which has
bucked the crisis. German  unemployment  is at a two-decade low of
6.7 percent and the economic growth that helped the euro area
avoid recession is lessening Merkel’s incentive to change tack
as  Germany  heads toward its own election next year.  “A further negative shock from Europe has significantly
more potential to have a negative impact on the U.S. than on
Germany,” Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a research fellow at the
Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington,
said in an interview. “If we had 5 percent unemployment, there
wouldn’t be much contagion to the U.S. If we had strong job
growth, a balanced budget, this wouldn’t really matter much to
investors.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said at a
congressional hearing yesterday that Europe’s debt crisis
“poses significant risks to the U.S. financial system and the
economy.”  G-20 Meeting  The White House is keeping up the pressure as Obama, Merkel
and other Group of 20 leaders prepare to meet at Los Cabos,
Mexico, on June 18-19, nine days before the next EU crisis
summit in Brussels.  “We’ve noted a sense of urgency in  Europe  among European
leaders, and we hope that urgency will lead to expedited action
in the coming days and weeks,” White House spokesman  Jay Carney 
said yesterday.  That means Merkel most of all. The leader of Europe’s
largest economy says that the 17 euro nations now have the
crisis-fighting tools and financial firewalls they need. Fixing
their debt, growth and competitiveness gaps will take years, she
said.  “No substantial changes in policy can happen without
Germany,” said  Nigel Gault , an economist at IHS Global Insight
in Lexington, Mass. “Germany is the European paymaster.”  On the campaign trail, Obama is citing Europe as a drag on
the U.S. recovery. After the U.S. Labor Department said on June
1 that payrolls expanded by only 69,000 last month and the
 unemployment rate  rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent, he said
European leaders haven’t done enough to dispel “the cloud
that’s hanging over from the Atlantic.”  Wide Impact  “What happens in Greece has an impact here in the United
States,” he said in a May 21 news conference. “Businesses are
more hesitant to invest if they see a lot of uncertainty looming
across the Atlantic because they’re not sure whether that’s
going to mean a further global slowdown.”  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate from
January through March, down from a 2.2 percent prior estimate,
the Commerce Department said on May 31. U.S. stocks last month
declined the most since September as Europe’s debt crisis
worsened. The  Standard & Poor’s   500 Index (SPX)  pared gains after
Bernanke’s remarks. The index closed down less than 0.1 percent
to 1,314.99 at 4 p.m. in New York. The yield on the  10-year
Treasury note  lost two basis points to 1.64 percent.  The euro declined 0.8 percent to $1.2463 at 11:13 a.m.
Berlin time after German exports fell in April and Italian
industrial production shrank, underscoring the impact of the
crisis on the euro area’s core.  Early Relationship  Even before Obama was elected, Merkel signaled she would
push back when she disagreed. In July 2008, Obama wanted to hold
a speech at Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate. Merkel rejected the spot
as presumptuous for a U.S. candidate and Obama relocated to the
Victory Column, two kilometers (1.2 miles) away.  Since taking office, Obama has feted Merkel with a state
dinner at the White House and awarded her the Presidential Medal
of Freedom. Over the last year, Obama and Merkel have talked at
least a dozen times by telephone and in two video conferences,
according to the White House.  Obama’s comments during her visit last June echoed the
prodding by U.S. officials such as Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  for Merkel to put up more money more quickly.  Europe’s financial situation “cannot be allowed to put the
global economic recovery at risk,” Obama said at the time.
“America’s economic growth depends on a sensible resolution.”  High Stakes  Last week,  Lael Brainard , the Treasury Department’s top
international envoy, visited  Greece , Germany, Spain and France
to discuss Europe’s crisis response. The U.S. has “tremendous
stakes in Europe succeeding,” she said back in Washington on
June 5.  All the pressure may backfire with Merkel, 57, the former
physicist who dreamed of traveling in the U.S. when she lived
under communism in former East Germany and now has to balance
Germans’ bailout fatigue with her goal of preserving the euro.  “The Merkel government is really getting sick of all the
complaining and lecturing from the Obama administration,”
Fredrik Erixon, head of the European Centre for International
Political Economy in Brussels, said by phone. “It’s really
infuriating for them to hear someone like Geithner lecturing
Europe on what it has to do given all the U.S. problems like the
debt and the deficit.”  ECB Pushback  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  also pushed
back. While parts of the crisis “unavoidably affect” the rest
of the world, “I don’t think we should carry this reasoning too
far,” he told reporters in Frankfurt on June 6, citing the U.S.
economy as an example. All countries “have to address their own
problems,” he said.  The U.S. adminstration’s pressure on Germany is unwise and
shows a lack of knowledge about the roots of the crisis, Glenn Hubbard, an economic adviser to Republican presidential
candidate Mitt Romney, was quoted as saying in the Dusseldorf,
Germany-based Handelsblatt newspaper today.  Aiming to line up allies, Obama, 50, on May 30 held a
videoconference on the crisis with Merkel, Monti and French
President Francois Hollande, both advocates of debt-sharing in
the euro area. Obama and U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
“agreed on the need for an immediate plan to tackle the
crisis” during a call on June 5, according to White House
statements.  The German leader didn’t take the bait during a town hall-
style event with Cameron in Berlin yesterday. People “must be
patient” and not expect the euro crisis to be resolved
overnight, she said.  “Merkel thinks she knows how to resolve this and believes
that what’s good for curing the euro debt crisis will also be
good for the U.S.,”  Jan Techau , director of the European Center
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Brussels,
said in an interview. “Merkel’s considerations for the euro
crisis are very independent of the U.S. and U.S. elections.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
