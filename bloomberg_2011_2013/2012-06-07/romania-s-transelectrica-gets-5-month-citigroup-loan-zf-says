Romanian state-owned utility
 Transelectrica SA (TEL)  secured a five-month loan valued at 125
million lei ($35 million) from  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to cover certain
immediate funding needs, Ziarul Financiar  reported .  The loan will be used as a “buffer” to balance payments
for bills due in 30 days, the Bucharest-based newspaper quoted
Marian Gheorghita, Transelectrica’s chief financial officer, as
saying.  The costs of the loan have been included in
Transelectrica’s regulated-transport tariffs, Gheorghita told
Ziarul Financiar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
