U.S. stocks trimmed gains after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economy is at
risk from Europe’s debt crisis and fiscal tightening, while not
detailing steps the central bank might take to stoke growth.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.8 percent to
1,324.98 at 10:03 a.m. in New York after earlier rallying as
much as 1.1 percent following China’s interest-rate cut.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
