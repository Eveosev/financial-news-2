MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , Africa’s largest
mobile-phone operator, said it started upgrading its Nigerian
phone network to expand capacity and improve the quality of its
services.  “The network modernization and swap-out project is part of
the $1.3 billion investment we have earmarked for 2012,” the
company said today in an e-mailed statement from Lagos, the
commercial capital. The project, which will be handled by
 Ericsson AB (ERICB) , Huawei Technologies Co. and  ZTE Corp. (000063)  of  China ,
will be carried out at night to reduce the effect on the quality
of the carrier’s service, it said in the statement.  MTN Nigeria is the biggest phone company in the country,
Africa’s most populous nation with more than 160 million people.
The unit of MTN, based in Johannesburg, has 40 million customers
on its Nigerian network, or a 48 percent share of the country’s
84 million mobile-phone subscribers, according to the  Nigeria
Communications Commission , the industry regulator.  MTN Nigeria was fined 360 million naira ($2.2 million) by
the telecommunications regulator on May 11 for failing to meet a
minimum service standard.  The phone company said on April 25 it is suffering from
growing damage to its fiber-optic network in the country, with
more than 70 cuts to the lines a month nationwide. Poor road
construction practices account for 42 percent of the incidents,
while 25 percent comes from damage by criminals and 33 percent
from other incidents including sabotage, according to MTN
Nigeria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
