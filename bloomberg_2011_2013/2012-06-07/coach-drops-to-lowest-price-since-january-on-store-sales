Coach Inc. (COH) , the largest U.S. luxury
handbag maker, dropped to the lowest level in almost five months
amid investor concern that department-store sales are slowing.  Coach fell 2.3 percent to $61.38 at 11:49 a.m. in New York,
after touching $59.81, for the lowest price since Jan. 12. The
stock, which was the seventh- worst performer  in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, had risen 2.9 percent this year before today.  Coach, which has dominated the U.S. luxury handbag category
for more than a decade, is up against increasing competition
from  Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL) ,  Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. (KORS)  and the Kate
Spade brand. In April, the New York-based company reported
fiscal-third quarter sales that beat analysts’ estimates by the
 smallest margin  in 11 quarters as North American department-
store sales slipped.  “Slowing industry sales trends at department stores” are
driving the decline, David Schick, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus
& Co. in Baltimore, wrote in a note to clients today. Michael
Kors also dropped, for the same reason, wrote Schick, who
recommends buying Coach.  “Obviously, the macro environment is uncertain and one of
the things that we work hard to do is to navigate nimbly through
that environment,” Chief Executive Officer Lew Frankfort told
investors June 5 at a Piper Jaffray Cos. consumer conference.  “So this quarter there are some puts and takes, but
overall I think that you will be pleased with our results,
although of course we have nearly four weeks to go.”  Michael Kors  fell 5.3 percent to $36.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
