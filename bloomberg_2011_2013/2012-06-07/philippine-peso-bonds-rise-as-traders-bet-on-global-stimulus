The Philippine peso rose to a three-
week high and bonds gained on speculation global policy makers
will announce measures to spur economic growth amid Europe’s
persistent debt crisis.  The  European Central Bank  is “ready to act” on downside
risks to the outlook, President Mario Draghi said in Frankfurt
yesterday. The U.S. economy may warrant additional monetary
stimulus as it remains vulnerable to setbacks, Federal Reserve
Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said in Boston. The Philippines needs
no extraordinary measures to stabilize the peso, which remains
broadly stable, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy Governor Diwa
Guinigundo said May 29.  “The market is speculating the ECB will take the necessary
steps to resolve their crisis and that’s boosting global
sentiment,” said Rey Infante, a currency trader at  Philippine
National Bank (PNB)  in Manila.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 43.16 per dollar as of 4:00
p.m. in  Manila  and reached 43.045, the highest level since May
17, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, fell 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 6.75
percent.  The yield on 6.375 percent government bonds due January
2022 fell six basis points to 5.39 percent, according to
Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
