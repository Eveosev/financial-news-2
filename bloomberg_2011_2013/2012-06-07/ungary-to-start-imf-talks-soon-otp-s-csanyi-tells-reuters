Hungary will probably “soon” start
talks on a bailout with the  International Monetary Fund  and the
European Union,  Reuters  reported, citing Sandor Csanyi, chief
executive officer of  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , the country’s biggest
lender.  An agreement on a credit line, which will probably take
three to four months to reach once the negotiations start, may
cut Hungary’s cost of insuring government debt against default
by “at least” 150 to 200 basis points, Csanyi was cited as
saying in an interview with Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
