Crude shipments from Dansk
Undergrunds Consortium, the producer part-owned by A.P. Moeller
Maersk A/S, will ship six cargoes in July, unchanged from June,
according to a revised loading program.  Exports will total 3.6 million barrels, or 116,129 barrels
a day, compared with 120,000 barrels a day for June, the plan
obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Copenhagen-based Maersk holds 39 percent of the venture,
known as DUC.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  owns 46 percent and  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  has 15 percent. Shell will receive three cargoes, Maersk
will get two, and Chevron one, according to the schedule.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
