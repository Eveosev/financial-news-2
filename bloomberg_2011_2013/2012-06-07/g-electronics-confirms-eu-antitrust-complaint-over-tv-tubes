LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  said it’s
“aware” that the European Commission issued it an antitrust
complaint in a price-fixing probe involving the cathode-ray
industry.  Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA)  said yesterday it also
received a European Union antitrust complaint in the
investigation that began in 2007 with company raids by
regulators in the EU, Japan and  South Korea .  The EU made the complaints against LG and Philips to
hold them responsible for the behavior of LG.Philips Displays, a
now-defunct joint venture that made the tubes for televisions
and computer monitors, said two people who declined to be named
because the matter isn’t public.  “LG Electronics is aware that the European Commission has
issued the supplemental statement of objections,” Ken
Hong, a spokesman for the company in  Seoul , said in an e-mail.  “We’ve been in close contact with the relevant authorities
throughout the investigation and will continue to cooperate
until the conclusion of this case,” Hong said, adding that the
company isn’t “100 percent clear” on what regulators’
intentions are.  The commission confirmed sending supplementary statements
of objections last week and declined to name those involved. The
Brussels-based commission can fine companies accused of
operating a cartel as much as 10 percent of their annual sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
