Chris Hughton  was named manager of
Norwich City, succeeding  Paul Lambert  at the English Premier
League soccer club.  Hughton, who’s left Birmingham City, takes over a club that
Lambert led to two straight promotions and 12th position in the
Premier League in 2011-12. The 53-year-old’s appointment was
announced at a news conference today.  Lambert joined  Aston Villa  on June 2, replacing Alex
McLeish who was fired in May after the club’s 16th-place finish
in the top division.  Hughton replaced McLeish at Birmingham last June after the
Blues were demoted from the Premier League. He led the Midlands
team to fourth place in the Championship and a promotion playoff
semifinal defeat to Blackpool.  Previously, Hughton led Newcastle back into the elite
division before being dismissed in December 2010. His playing
career included spells at Tottenham, West Ham and Brentford, as
well as 53 games for the Republic of Ireland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
