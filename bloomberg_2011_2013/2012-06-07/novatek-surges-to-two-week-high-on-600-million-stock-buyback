OAO Novatek surged in Moscow and
 London  trading as  Russia ’s second-biggest natural-gas producer
said it would buy back as much as $600 million of stock within
the next 12 months.  The shares gained 5.9 percent to 319.80 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the most since July 2011. The stock rose 7 percent to
$107 in London, the highest level since Oct. 6.  “It’s a very positive development and part of an
increasing trend among Russian corporates to take advantage of
mispriced equities,” Julian Rimmer, a trader at CF Global
Trading UK Ltd. in London, said by e-mail. “It demonstrates
confidence in their business and should reassure investors.”  Novatek plans to buy back shares and global depositary
receipts within a year from today, the company said in a
statement. The stock purchased under the program may be used for
financing operations or in employee compensation and incentive
programs, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
