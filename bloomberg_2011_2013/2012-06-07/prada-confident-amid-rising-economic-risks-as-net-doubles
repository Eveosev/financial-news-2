Prada SpA (1913) , the Italian maker of
$2,950 perforated patent-leather handbags, said it’s confident
in its brands amid rising economic risks after first-quarter
profit more than doubled.  Net income rose to 121.7 million euros ($153 million) in
the three months ended April 30 compared with 57.7 million euros
a year earlier, the Milan-based company said yesterday in a
statement. Revenue climbed 48 percent to 686.7 million euros.  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and slowing economic growth
in  China  have so far failed to reduce demand for high-end goods.
Paris-based  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the world’s
largest maker of luxury products, said in April that sales
growth was accelerating. Prada sales surged 57 percent in Europe
and 47 percent in the Asia-Pacific region in the quarter.  The results “are to a certain extent almost too good to be
true,” Erwan Rambourg, an analyst at HSBC in  Hong Kong , wrote
in a note to clients. He has an overweight recommendation on the
stock. “Prada looks like a very good story.”  The earnings were released after the stock market closed in
Hong Kong, where the company’s shares trade. Prada  fell  2.4
percent to HK$45.45 yesterday, giving the owner of the Prada,
Miu Miu, Church’s and Car Shoe brands a market value of HK$116.3
billion ($15 billion).  Rising Risks  While the quarterly performance is encouraging, “we must
consider, at the same time, the rising risks deriving from the
uncertain international economic environment, in order to be
ready to take any necessary actions to safeguard our assets and
preserve our long-term growth strategy,” Prada said yesterday.  Shares of luxury-good companies gained after the
announcement. LVMH rose 2.3 percent in Paris, and  Swatch Group
AG (UHR) , the owner of the Omega watch brand, advanced 4.6 percent in
Zurich.  Prada’s revenue increased in all regions, including 34
percent in the Americas and 54 percent in each of Greater China
and  Italy . Leather goods was Prada’s best-performing category.  Retail sales climbed 49 percent on a reported basis and 19
percent at stores open at least a year, excluding currency
swings.  Prada plans to open 100 stores in 2012, and 80 in each of
the next two years, in markets including  Brazil , China and
Persian Gulf countries, Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli said in May. The company had 395 directly operated
stores and 25 franchises at the end of April, it said yesterday.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization advanced 77 percent to 200.1 million euros,
representing 29.1 percent of sales.  Prada said it has had a positive net financial position
since Jan. 31 and had net cash of 122.4 million euros at April
30. An increase in long-term bank debt is mainly due to new
funds raised in  Japanese yen , Prada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
