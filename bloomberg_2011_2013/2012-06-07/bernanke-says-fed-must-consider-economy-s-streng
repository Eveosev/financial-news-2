Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers that U.S. central bankers will need to
assess the trajectory of growth before deciding on whether
further stimulus is needed.  “The main question we have to address has to do with the
likely strength of the economy going forward,” Bernanke said
today in response to questions from Senator  Bob Casey , a
Democrat from Pennsylvania. “Will there be enough growth going
forward to make material progress on the  unemployment rate ?”  “If we decide that further action is required, then of
course we have to decide what action is appropriate or what
communications are appropriate,” Bernanke said in testimony to
the Joint Economic Committee.  “We do have options that we can consider,” Bernanke said,
without listing them. The Fed would have to make “difficult
assessments” to weigh the costs and benefits of future
policies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
