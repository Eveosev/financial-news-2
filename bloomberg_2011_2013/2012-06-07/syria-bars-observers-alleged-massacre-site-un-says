A United Nations monitoring team has
been prevented from entering a village in Hama province in  Syria 
where the opposition says at least 78 people, more than half of
them women and children, were killed.  The observers are being stopped at Syrian army checkpoints
and in some cases turned back, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the head of the UN supervision mission in
Syria, General Robert Mood. Civilians are stopping some of the
UN patrols and residents in the area are warning that the
monitors’ safety is at risk if they enter the village of Mazraat
al-Qubeir, he said.  “Despite these challenges, the observers are still working
to get into the village to try to establish the facts on the
ground,” Mood said. “UNSMIS is concerned about the restriction
imposed on its movement as it will impede our ability to
monitor, observe and report.”    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
