Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen, which
will take over WestLB AG’s Verbundbank unit, also wants to
acquire the German lender’s cash management and depositary bank
operations,  Frankfurter Rundschau  reported today, citing people
involved in the negotiations between WestLB and Helaba.  Helaba would after such a transaction settle some 15
billion euros ($18.9 billion) in payments every year and
increase its balance sheet by 40 billion euros to almost 200
billion euros, the newspaper said. The number of employees would
rise by 450 to 6,500,  Frankfurter Rundschau  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
