Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers that further rounds of stimulus could
boost the economy, yet may have “diminishing returns.”  “We continue to believe that potentially these sorts of
measures could still add some additional accommodation, some
additional support to the economy,” Bernanke said today in
response to questions from Congress. “There may be some
diminishing returns and that would be a consideration we’d have
to look at” as  interest rates  are already low.  Bernanke said that the Fed’s analysis of previous rounds of
large-scale asset purchases showed that “they lowered the
spreads between private rates and government rates,” thus
lowering borrowing costs for corporations, on mortgages, and
increasing stock prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
