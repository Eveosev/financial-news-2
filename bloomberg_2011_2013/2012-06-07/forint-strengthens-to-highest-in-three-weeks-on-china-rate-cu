The forint rose to the strongest in
three weeks after  China  cut  interest rates  for the first time
since 2008, stepping up efforts to combat a deepening economic
slowdown.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 1.1 percent to 294.7 per
euro by 5 p.m. in Budapest, the strongest since May 17. That
took the forint’s advance this week to 3.6 percent. The
government’s benchmark 10-year bonds rallied, cutting yields 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 8.368 percent.  Demand for riskier assets rose as China’s move fanned
optimism that global policy makers will act to bolster growth.
The forint fell as much as 0.5 percent earlier today after data
showed that Hungary’s industrial output unexpectedly plunged in
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
